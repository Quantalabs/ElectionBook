Too bad for J.D. Vance, it wasn’t him. Being the dedicated correspondent that I am, I’ve been on the ground in Milwaukee since Tuesday to monitor all the GOP mayhem. From my perch (at a convention site bar on Wednesday evening), it seemed that the keynote speaker was the least buzzed-about orator of the day. As the bearded Beltway outsider took the stage, the audience’s eyes dropped to their iPhones to read breaking news about President Joe Biden testing positive for COVID. The delegates doom-scrolled and lol’d as Vance ranted about ‘cheap Chinese goods [made] with cheap foreign labor.’ (He better not check the labels on that ‘Trump 2024’ merch.) In fact, no one looked up until Vance started telling the story of his self-described ‘hillbilly’ grandma who raised him in Rust Belt Ohio while his mother was addicted to drugs. When ‘Mamaw’ died, Vance said, the family found 19 loaded handguns in her house, ‘under her bed, in her closet, in the silverware drawer.’ Then Vance recognized his mother Bev, who was sitting next to Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, and heavily-mascaraed eyes (Not mine! My heart’s too hard to ruin a good pair of falsies) welled with tears. ‘I’m proud to say that tonight, my mom is here, 10 years clean and sober. I love you, Mom,’ he said, prompting the convention crowd to erupt. Though neither Bev nor even Mamaw stole MAGA hearts last night. That prize went to 17-year-old Kai Trump, the former president’s eldest granddaughter, who demonstrated the poise of a woman twice her age. She told the crowd, ‘a lot of people have put my grandpa through hell, and he’s still standing.’ She’s chip off the old orange block. On the night that The Donald introduced his running mate to America – it was a Trump who grabbed all the headlines. What’s more Trumpian than that? Assassination Chic Donald’s brush with death has sparked a surprisingly hot new fashion trend among the GOP 50-something set. I met Joe Neglia, an Arizona delegate who taped a white envelope to his right ear. He did it in solidarity with 45, who’s been proudly parading around the hall with a big bandage over his badly disfigured right lobe. The only downside is that already hard-of-hearing delegates have rendered themselves deaf. Milwaukee’s Best? On the convention floor, I also met one handsy, love-struck Trump impressionist donning a blond wig and MAGA hat who seemed, well, inebriated. I feared he was going to pole vault into Fox News anchor Shannon Bream’s broadcasting booth for a smooch. Where’s the Secret Service when you need them? One-way ticket to Crazytown At a book signing for MAGA rodeo clown Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, I happened across two Texas convention-goers, who had been waiting hours to meet their idol. ‘It’s going to be MTG and Congresswoman Lauren Boebert on top of the GOP tickets in 2028, mark our words,’ swore Jan, as her friend Alice nodded in agreement. Ah heck, in our bat poop-crazy politics that might just make sense. Mean Girlz Peckish journalists and attention-starved lawmakers got a chance to hobnob in CNN’s unimaginatively named CNN Grill. But when I grabbed a chopped salad and a Coke Zero I got an unwanted serving of side-eye from snotty CNN chief political correspondent Dana Bash. At least the network’s chief of chiefs knows how to charm a fangirl. When Wolf Blitzer walked by, I screamed, ‘Blitzer – you sexy beast!’ Without batting a silver eyelash, he responded, ‘You’ve got that right.’ Muppets take Milwaukee Speaking of Silver Foxes – who was that handsome man with glowing rugged skin and luscious salt-and-pepper waves? The new Golden Bachelor? Sam Eagle from The Muppets? No, it was the captivatingly boring North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum fresh off losing the Veep-lympics. ‘Hey, Doug!’ I called, ‘I thought it was going to be you. You were at the top of my list.’ He gave me the reassuring look of a man who had just been told that his tumor was benign. ‘It’s ok, I have the greatest job in the world,’ said Burgum. ‘Ah, yes,’ I said. ‘You’re the Dakota Governor who didn’t shoot their dog!’ Unleash Elise! I strolled passed by New York Congresswoman Elise Stefanik as she was basking in her post-convention speech adulation. She won over conservatives in December when she dressed down serial plagiarist/antisemite apologist ex-Harvard President Claudine Gay. ‘I hope you do to the Secret Service Director what you did to Claudine Gay!’ I yelled. ‘Oh, don’t worry,’ she replied. ‘I have plenty of questions.’ Rudy can fail You could almost hear the Merlot sloshing when America’s Mayor did a slow-motion, a** over tea kettle stumble into a row of folding chairs on Wednesday afternoon. It took two burly staffers to get Rudy Giuliani back on his feet. Oh, how the mighty have fallen and can’t get up. ‘Shut up Gaetz’ Bad boy Florida Congressman Matty Gaetz marred the RNC’s unity-themed night on Tuesday when he bum-rushed former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who was in the middle of an interview. The two have had beef ever since McCarthy said Gaetz begged him to quash a House investigation into claims that Gaetz paid a teen for sex. Gaetz started screeching at McCarthy: ‘If you were on that [convention] stage you’d get booed off. You would get booed off the stage.’ One Illinois delegate spoke for all of us when he got into Gaetz’s face and said: ‘Shut up Gaetz… you’re an a**hole.’ Tight and Shiny I caught up with the fuming Floridian myself before his speech on Wednesday. His taut forehead gleamed like the underside of a stretched beaver pelt. ‘You speaking tonight?’ I asked. Gaetz: ‘Nah, tomorrow. I’ve had to rewrite my speech 87 times… I wanted to talk about the assassination attempt, but they don’t want anyone to touch it.’ ‘You know me,’ he said. ‘I’m going to tell it like it is, I’m a straight shooter.’ Gulp! Eat your Wheaties Outside the Fiserv Forum, where the magic is happening, you can find a glittering array of overpriced Chinese-made MAGA merch. A box of ‘Trump cereal’ will set you back $20. Same for the ‘I’m Voting For The Felon’ T-shirt. It’s all guaranteed to get you kicked out of your millennial niece’s baby-naming… or your money back! Vivek in the House! I ran into ex-motormouth GOP hopeful and Jimmy Neutron-impersonator Vivek Ramaswamy on the Fox News set of Gutfeld! Wednesday night. ‘Looks like there actually will be a Vivek in the White House!’ I said. (J.D. Vance and his wife Usha have a son named Vivek) For that, I got a chuckle and a scoop: Vivek might run for Vance’s Senate seat.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nOn night three of the RNC, a new MAGA star was born.&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Inside the RNC: Funny Stories about Trump Impersonators, CNN Anchor, and Vivek&#8217;s Senate Plan &#8211; Get Ready for a Crazy 2024 first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/inside-the-rnc-funny-stories-about-trump-impersonators-cnn-anchor-and-viveks-senate-plan-get-ready-for-a-crazy-2024/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/07/18/23/87514713-13648909-image-a-1_1721341666360.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-19 00:32:24","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.132},{"id":252113874,"title":"Who Could Be Kamala Harris' Vice President? 5 Candidates","text":"As speculation about President Joe Biden's 2024 candidacy swirls, some believe Vice President Kamala Harris would become the Democratic nominee. But who could take her place? An expert told Newsweek his thoughts on the candidates.Biden has faced growing pressure in the aftermath of last month's debate to step aside and let another Democrat take his place. Top Democrats, like kingmaker and Representative Jim Clyburn, have already signaled that they'd back Harris if Biden leaves the race and polls show that most Democratic voters support Harris at the top of the ticket.An Economist/YouGov survey conducted this week found that 79 percent would support Harris as the Democratic nominee if Biden were to withdraw from the race. Harris would also benefit from the $91 million war chest that the Biden-Harris campaign has raised.While she may be the obvious choice to replace Biden, Harris would have to pick her own running mate if she were to become the nominee.\"Truthfully, they all have something to offer,\" Audrey Haynes, a politics professor at the University of Georgia, told Newsweek of the contenders. \"The Democratic Party has a strong bench and the choice will depend on who is at the top of the ticket. Who will balance the ticket, provide some electoral benefit (perhaps move a swing state) or perhaps expand a voter bloc that may have voters to expand vote margins in close races.\"\"At this juncture, a governor, who is popular, and has a strong economic record in their state, would be the most valuable foil for competing with the Trump Vance ticket,\" Haynes said. \"Neither of whom have the type of executive experience that governors earn over time.\"Pennsylvania Governor Josh ShapiroA rising Democratic star, Josh Shapiro is often floated as a possible running mate for Harris. He governs a major battleground state and could help Harris make inroads among voters in the Keystone State.Shapiro, who comfortably beat Trump-backed Doug Mastriano in 2022, is wildly popular in his home state and enjoys support from both Democrats and Republicans. The only governor with a divided state legislature, Shapiro was able to reach a bipartisan agreement just last week. He's also been applauded for his handling of major infrastructure crises, including the collapse of the I-95 bridge last year and the train derailment in Ohio, which borders Pennsylvania.Of all the potential VP contenders, Shapiro might be among the sharpest of the group because his presence could help Democrats secure Pennsylvania, Jeffrey Kraus, a politics professor at Wagner College, told Newsweek.\"Shapiro has never lost an election and is closer to the center of the Democratic Party,\" Kraus said.Michael Gordon, a Democratic strategist and principal at Group Gordon, also said Shapiro would have \"the biggest impact on the outcome\" of the 2024 election.\"He's a popular governor of a swing state with a lot of electoral votes. He's also a young rising star who could inspire voters in other swing states,\" Gordon told Newsweek.But with only two years under his belt, experts think that Shapiro would be wise to continue working for voters in Pennsylvania, especially if he has plans to run for the commander-in-chief position himself later down the line.\"It is hard for me to imagine that Josh Shapiro would want to be anyone's running mate,\" Berwood Yost, Director of the Floyd Institute for Public Policy and Center for Opinion Research at Franklin & Marshall College, told PoliticsPA.com. \"He would undoubtedly be a great choice given that he is a popular governor in one of the key states Democrats must carry in 2024, but what benefit would there be for him to take the position?\"North Carolina Governor Roy CooperRoy Cooper's governorship has been a sign of hope for Democrats in the Tar Heel state.While the party hasn't won a presidential election in the state since 2008, Cooper was elected in 2016 and 2020 despite former President Donald Trump's Electoral College victories in both elections. Cooper won in 2016 mostly in opposition to a bill banning transgender people from public restrooms of their gender. In 2020, he was reelected for his handling of the pandemic and natural disasters in the state.Kraus said Cooper might help attract North Carolina voters to the ticket, but because the governor doesn't have a national profile, he said, \"I don't know what else he might bring to the ticket besides putting North Carolina in play.\"\"Roy Cooper can fit the bill too as a popular governor of a swing state,\" Gordon said. \"He is a safe choice but may not be as inspiring nationally as Shapiro.\"Cooper is also close to Harris, having served as the attorney general in North Carolina at the same time Harris held the position in California. He's commended her for being able to relate to women voters and appeared alongside her at events in his home state, calling her a \"fighter.\"Harris herself has said of Cooper, \"I've known him for almost two decades, and he is an extraordinary leader.\"Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Cooper was \"an emerging favorite\" for Harris.Michigan Governor Gretchen WhitmerGretchen Whitmer's name has long been floated as a possible presidential candidate and a Harris-Whitmer ticket would mark the first all-women ticket in history.\"Whether the Democrats would run a ticket with two female candidates is an open question,\" Kraus said.Whitmer's position in Michigan could help the Democratic Party win back voters who abandoned the party in response to Biden's response to the Israel-Hamas war.The state, which is home to more than 200,000 registered voters who are Muslim and 300,000 people who claim ancestry from the Middle East and North Africa, has spelled trouble for Biden in recent months. Despite winning Michigan by 154,000 votes in 2020, Biden is now trailing behind Trump by 1.6 percentage points, according to RealClearPolling averages.Michigan also has a decadeslong streak of voting for the winning presidential candidate. The state has not voted for a losing candidate since 2004.Whitmer, who easily won reelection in 2022 and brought a Democratic trifecta with her, has expressed her support for Harris. On Tuesday, she said that she would be \"eager\" to support Harris as the nominee if Biden were to exit the race.Kentucky Governor Andy BeshearAndy Beshear impressed many Democrats when he won a second term in the conservative state last year.\"Andy Beshear is a rising star, but Harris won't win Kentucky, even with him on the ticket,\" Gordon said.While Kentucky is not seen as a likely pickup in November and Beshear's departure to the White House would leave the state without any Democrats, he's one of the most popular and youngest governors in the country.A Morning Consult poll conducted last year found that Beshear is tied with Hawaii Governor Josh Green as the most popular Democratic governor among Trump voters. He is also the most popular Democratic governor among Biden voters. The survey showed that Beshear has the highest net approval rating of any Democratic governor in a red state, with overall approval at 60 percent.Beshear told reporters last week that he had concerns about Biden's candidacy but that he wasn't calling for the president to step aside.At the press conference, he signaled that he would be open to leaving his role for one that helps \"the Commonwealth even more\" but said that he wasn't planning to and that his current role is \"more than enough for me.\"California Governor Gavin NewsomNewsom has become one of the most nationally recognizable figures within the Democratic Party.He drew speculations about his White House ambitions last year when he debated Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, prompting some to ask what Newsom was doing facing off against a Republican presidential candidate when he wasn't in the 2024 race.Billed as a red state versus blue state debate, the two governors clashed over taxes, immigration, crime, guns, abortion and the pandemic in a 90-minute event moderated by Fox News. Newsom repeatedly defended Biden as DeSantis argued that the president's mental state was in decline.\"We have one thing in common, neither of us will be the nominee for our party in 2024,\" Newsom said during the debate.But Newsom as VP could cause problems for Harris since both of them are from California, similar to how observers questioned if Trump picking Senator Marco Rubio could present the same constitutional question since both Republicans were from Florida.\"The reality is that none of these governors really would make a difference to a Harris-led ticket,\" Kraus said. \"For that matter, Harris might not be the best candidate to lead the ticket, although it seems that will be the only scenario if Biden (and this is not a sure thing) withdraws.\"\"At best, the Democrats should focus on retaining the Senate and trying to retake the House. Unless something else happens, Trump seems likely to prevail,\" he said.","summary":"If Harris replaces Biden as the Democratic nominee, who will she choose to serve as her running mate?","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/who-could-kamala-harris-vice-president-candidates-1927297","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2431994/kamala-harris-vp-pick.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-19 00:24:54","author":"Katherine Fung","authors":["Katherine Fung"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.157},{"id":252113976,"title":"LILLEY: Biden being forced out now likely too late for Dems","text":"Just 30% say Harris would make a good president, and 49% say she could not make a good president while 20% had no opinion.

For Whitmer, just 15% believed she’d make a good president while 64% didn’t know. Biden’s mental and physical decline has been noticeable for some time but has become more severe over the past six to eight months. He is clearly not the same man who ran four years ago. He has trouble walking stairs, trouble finding his way off stage and lately, trouble finishing a sentence. As voters look at all of this and consider their ballot choices, Biden becomes less viable. It’s not just affecting Biden’s chances in swing states, the states in play are growing and Trump’s likelihood of winning is growing. If Democrats really cared about winning, and about Joe Biden, they would have replaced him by last fall. Having him step aside by the end of this weekend may not be enough to turn things around by November. The world watches.

A new survey of Massachusetts delegates found that 62 percent of the delegates think Biden should stay in the race. Fifteen percent said they think he should drop out, another 15 percent were unsure, and nine percent didn’t want to say. The survey, conducted by The MassINC Polling Group for CommonWealth Beacon, polled respondents about their thoughts on other potential candidates if Biden were to drop out. Sixty-seven percent of respondents said they would support Vice President Kamala Harris if she were to become the nominee. CommonWealth Beacon notes the survey results are not “representative of the delegation, but they are illustrative of what’s on their minds.” Why does this matter? The Democratic party is at a massive crossroads less than a month before their national convention in Chicago. An ABC News poll revealed that 86 percent of Americans think Biden, the presumptive nominee, is too old to serve another four years as president. After a shaky performance at a debate last month and other less-than-spectacular public engagements (including referring to Harris as “Vice President Trump” in a recent press conference), Biden has seen more than two dozen high ranking Democratic officials calling on him to step out of the race. This poll serves as a microcosm for what Massachusetts delegates specifically are thinking. It shows the stark divides within the Democratic party, even in a state as blue as Massachusetts. Governor Maura Healey said earlier this month that Biden should “listen to the American people and carefully evaluate whether he remains our best hope to defeat Donald Trump.” Three members of the Massachusetts Congressional delegation have come out with statements either concerned with Biden’s ability to win, or flat-out calling for him to step off the ticket. What is a convention delegate? What is a delegate, anyway? Delegates are people chosen by their political parties. They carry the support and votes from their home state to the national convention. While they are usually very politically active within their party, they are tied to the candidate that won their state’s primary. How many are sent to the convention varies from state to state. Massachusetts will send 116 delegates and a few alternates to the convention. Notable delegates include Mayor Michelle Wu, Attorney General Andrea Campbell, and Lieutenant Governor Kim Driscoll. Congressional Representative Jake Auchincloss is also a delegate. When asked his thoughts on Biden stepping down, he said “We have strong people, not just the top of the ticket, but around the ticket, who can be strong surrogates.”","summary":"A survey of Massachusetts delegates found that only 62 percent of the delegates think Biden should stay in the race.\n\n\nThe post Mass. delegates divided over whether Biden should stay in the race, new survey shows appeared first on Boston.com.","url":"https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2024/07/18/mass-delegates-divided-over-whether-biden-should-stay-in-the-race-new-survey-shows/","image":"https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/6FEYTRTDGAC36IT4FWNCYEDKNU-6699a793ac5b9-768x432.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-19 00:17:13","author":"Eva Levin,The Massinc Polling","authors":["Eva Levin","The Massinc Polling"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.14},{"id":252113490,"title":"Elon Musk’s X Introduces Trump-Themed Hashtags After He Endorses Former President","text":"Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Topline Elon Musk’s X, formerly known as Twitter, now has two hashtags themed after former President Donald Trump on its platform—a change that follows the billionaire’s endorsement of the former president after he survived an assassination attempt at a rally Saturday.

Searching #Trump2024 on X now also includes a flurry of American flags that rain down from the top of the search page. The branded hashtags come a few days after Musk, the world’s wealthiest person, endorsed Trump, as well as hours before Trump is scheduled to speak and accept the Republican nomination at the Republican National Convention. #Biden2024 does not appear to have the same branded features as the Trump hashtags. The hashtag variants, which X calls “hashmojis,” have historically been used by advertisers or partners to promote events, products and brands and have been on the platform for years, usually lasting for about 24 hours once they’re enabled. X did not immediately answer Forbes’ inquiry asking whether the Trump-themed hashtags were purchased by his campaign, a Trump-affiliated organization or if they were added internally.

Forbes Valuation We estimate Musk’s net worth at $250.3 billion, making the Tesla chief the world’s wealthiest person, ahead of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos ($201.3 billion), and LVMH chief Bernard Arnault ($191.4 billion). Key Background Musk said, “I fully endorse President Trump,” following the attempted assassination of the former president Saturday. The endorsement from the billionaire was not a complete shocker, as Musk has become increasingly politically vocal in the lead-up to the presidential election, aligning with right-wing stances on matters such as immigration, free speech and vaccines. Musk tweeted earlier this year he was “leaning away” from President Joe Biden and did not explicitly support Trump at the time. The Tesla chief reportedly donated to a pro-Trump super PAC known as America PAC prior to the attempted assassination of Trump and will reportedly supply the organization with around $45 million a month.

Spokespeople for the former president have declined to comment. The polls and report on Mr Obama came after US media reported that former house speaker Nancy Pelosi and the two most senior Democrats in Congress, Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer, had advised Mr Biden to consider his candidacy for the good of the party. All have rejected the reports. The senior Democrat source told BBC News that the mood in Washington was grim: \"We are all waiting for the inevitable decision.\" Adam Smith, a Democratic congressman for Washington state, painted a similarly grim picture. Asked by BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight whether the party was \"coming to the end\" of Mr Biden's candidacy, he said: \"That is my sense\". \"I mean, I don’t know. But without question, I think that is the direction that this is heading right now.\" Mr Biden has faced a torrid few weeks since his poor showing in the first presidential debate late last month. He is currently in isolation in Delaware while he recovers from a Covid infection. By contrast, Donald Trump will give the headline speech at the Republican national convention in Milwaukee on Thursday evening, his first speech since surviving an assassination attempt. Delegates and supporters here have been in high spirits all week. Mr Biden has so far struck a defiant tone in response to Democratic pressure for him to step aside as the party's candidate. He continues to enjoy the public support of many politicians, including members of the powerful Congressional black caucus. But there are signs the Democratic leadership has begun to apply more pressure. Mr Schumer, the Senate Majority Leader and Mr Jeffries, the ranking Democrat in the House of Representatives, are reported to have told Mr Biden last week that their colleagues in Congress were \"concerned\" that his troubles would hit their own chances of re-election. Mr Schumer said the reports were \"idle speculation\", while Mr Jeffries said his was \"a private conversation that will remain private\". CNN meanwhile reported that Mrs Pelosi had told Mr Biden that polls show he cannot win. She later slammed the reporting as a \"feeding frenzy\", but did not deny that a conversation with Mr Biden had taken place. On Thursday, the Post reported that Mr Obama told several allies that Mr Biden, his former vice-president, must seriously consider if his candidacy remains viable. Jamie Raskin, a congressman from Maryland, wrote to Mr Biden, comparing him to a baseball pitcher at the end of his career - saying there was \"no shame\" in retiring \"to the overflowing appreciation of the crowd when your arm is tired out\". TJ Ducklo, a Biden campaign senior adviser, slammed reports of grandee concern as \"baseless conjecture from anonymous sources\". \"Joe Biden is his party's nominee,\" he wrote on X. \"He's running for re-election.\" Deputy campaign manager Quentin Fulks said Mr Biden was \"not wavering on anything. The president has made his decision. I don't want to be rude, but I don’t know how many more times we can answer that.\" Mr Biden has mild upper respiratory symptoms associated with Covid but does not have a fever, presidential doctor Kevin O'Connor said on Thursday, The White House said he was expected to meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after he arrives in the US on Wednesday.","summary":"A new poll shows Trump with his biggest lead of the campaign, as high-level Democrats are reportedly expressing fresh concern.","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c51y2v4vv7ko","image":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6198/live/57a605e0-453b-11ef-8102-c9e8652d6cfd.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-19 00:04:52","author":"Sam Cabral And Sarah Smith","authors":["Sam Cabral And Sarah Smith"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.227},{"id":252113214,"title":"Alarm bells ring in Japan as experts warn of fast-spreading new Covid variant KP. 3","text":"Japan is grappling with a new and highly contagious coronavirus variant that is fuelling the country’s 11th wave of Covid-19 infections, health experts warn. The KP. 3 variant is spreading rapidly, even among those who are vaccinated or have recovered from previous infections, according to Kazuhiro Tateda, president of the Japan Association of Infectious Diseases. “It is, unfortunately, the nature of the virus to become more resilient and resistant each time it changes into a different form,” Tateda told This Week in Asia. “People lose their immunity quite quickly after being vaccinated, so they have little or no resistance.” Tateda, who sits on Japan’s advisory panel formed at the start of the pandemic, said the coming weeks will be critical as authorities monitor the variant’s spread and impact. While hospitals have reported a sharp uptick in Covid-19 admissions, Tateda said he is “relieved that not many of these cases are severe”. Typical symptoms of the KP. 3 variant include high fever, sore throat, loss of smell and taste, headaches, and fatigue. According to the health ministry, medical facilities across Japan logged a 1.39-fold – or 39 per cent – increase in infections from July 1 to 7, compared to the previous week. Okinawa prefecture has been the hardest hit by the new strain of the virus, with hospitals reporting an average of nearly 30 infections per days. The KP. 3 variant has accounted for more than 90 per cent of Covid-19 cases nationwide, the Fuji News Network reported, leading to renewed concerns about bed shortages at medical facilities. Since Japan’s first detected Covid-19 case in early 2020 involving a man who returned from the Chinese city of Wuhan, East Asian nation has recorded a total of 34 million infections and around 75,000 related deaths. The country’s Covid-19 caseload peaked on August 5, 2022, when more than 253,000 people were receiving treatment. Japan’s uptick in cases coincides with similar increases being observed globally. In the US, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention reported a 23.5 per cent week-over-week rise in the number of people visiting hospitals with Covid-19 symptoms during the week ending July 6. High-profile US.figures such as President Joe Biden and Doug Emhoff, husband of Vice-President Kamala Harris, have recently tested positive and gone into isolation. Meanwhile, several riders in the ongoing Tour de France cycling race have also returned positive test results. Experts say it is too early to determine the full impact of the new variant on Japanese businesses or cross-border activities like travel. Precautionary measures are already in place at the country’s air and seaports to monitor the health of incoming arrivals. However, the global spike in cases may deter some Japanese from venturing abroad this summer. A recent survey by Nippon Life insurance found that just 3.2 per cent of Japanese plan to travel abroad in the coming months, which is likely to depress annual travel figures once again. In 2023, Japan saw 9.62 million outbound travellers, a recovery after three years of extremely low pandemic-era numbers, but still far below the 20.01 million outbound travellers recorded in 2019. Despite the latest surge, infectious disease expert Tateda insists there is no need for panic in Japan.

Fox News Digital spoke with multiple RNC attendees outside the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee, the site of the convention, and most felt Biden would ultimately drop his re-election bid, but that it would matter little when the votes are finally counted. \"I think [former President] Trump's going to mop the floor with anybody they put up,\" one attendee said, adding that it seemed Biden was \"on the way out the door.\" ALINA HABBA TAKES ON MAJOR ROLE IN TRUMP CAMPAIGN, DISHES ON HIS HIGHLY ANTICIPATED RNC SPEECH \"I don't think it really matters.

I think it'd be disastrous if they change right now,\" she said. \"I think he understands, and his compatriots understand, he needs to drop out. So I think he will. I have no idea who they're going to put up, you know, to replace him. I would hope it wouldn't be Kamala, but I have no idea,\" another said.

Biden was supported by 47 percent of the 2,247 voters surveyed, while 1 percent of respondents said they \"would not vote\" if Trump and Biden appeared on the ballot. The poll was conducted from July 16 to July 18.Thursday's results are a slight jump from a CBS News/YouGov poll taken in the days following the first presidential debate, where Biden's performance ignited concerns over the president's ability to defeat Trump and serve another four years in the White House. From June 28 to July 2, 50 percent of voters said they would vote for Trump if the election were held today, while Biden was backed by 48 percent.When asked the same question from June 5 to June 7, 50 percent of voters said they would back Trump, while 49 percent chose Biden.The polling boost comes a day after Trump broke his record in an Economist/YouGov poll, where nearly half (49 percent) of U.S. adults said they believe Trump will win in November regardless of whom they would support in the election.Polling analysis site FiveThirtyEight also gave Trump his largest lead on average across national polls on Thursday. The former president was up 3 percentage points on Biden—a 1 percent jump from the day before and 2.8 percent jump since the June 27 presidential debate.Newsweek reached out to Trump and Biden's campaigns via email for comment Thursday evening.Voters were also asked in the CBS News/YouGov poll released Thursday how they would vote if the election were held between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, considered the likely replacement for Biden if the president steps aside as the Democratic nominee. Harris fared a bit better than Biden, although she still lost to Trump, 48 percent to 51 percent.Out of the voters who indicated that they plan to support or are leaning toward Biden in the fall, half said they would choose the president \"mainly to oppose\" Trump in November. Twenty-seven percent of Biden's voters said they were choosing him because they \"like\" the president, while 23 percent said they were voting for him because he \"will be the Democratic nominee.\"When asked similar questions, 58 percent of the voters who indicated that they would vote for Trump or are leaning toward backing the former president said they were doing so because they \"like\" him.

Biden’s lawyers cited a federal judge’s decision on Monday to dismiss the criminal case accusing former President Donald Trump of illegally retaining classified documents after leaving office. Florida-based U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon found the appointment of the special counsel in that case, Jack Smith, violated the U.S. Constitution because Congress had not given him the authority to pursue the case. Smith’s office is appealing. “The Attorney General relied upon the exact same authority to appoint the Special Counsel in both the Trump and Biden matters, and both appointments are invalid for the same reason,” Biden’s lawyers argued in a court filing. A different special counsel, David Weiss, secured Hunter Biden’s conviction last month in Delaware federal court on charges he lied about his illegal drug use to buy a gun. Weiss is also leading a tax case against Biden that is scheduled to go to trial in September. Biden has pleaded not guilty in that case. A spokesperson for Weiss did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The move by Biden shows the potential ripple effects from Cannon’s decision to limit the attorney general’s ability to appoint a special counsel to handle politically sensitive investigations, a practice the U.S. Justice Department has used for decades. It also presents the awkward dynamic of the president’s son relying on a ruling benefiting Trump, his father’s Republican opponent in the Nov. 5 presidential election. Biden is likely to have a more difficult time challenging the special counsel because Cannon’s ruling focused on the fact that Smith was not in the U.S. government when appointed and had not been confirmed for the role by the Senate. Before being named special counsel, Weiss was confirmed by the Senate to serve as the top federal prosecutor in Biden’s home state of Delaware during the Trump administration. Biden previously challenged the appointment of Weiss on different grounds, efforts that were rejected by federal judges in both cases against him. Another defendant charged as part of Weiss’ investigation, Alexander Smirnov, moved to invalidate the special counsel after the ruling in Trump’s case. Smirnov has pleaded not guilty to charges that he lied to the FBI when he claimed knowledge of a bribe to Joe Biden.","summary":"WASHINGTON >> President Joe Biden&#8217;s son, Hunter Biden, moved on Thursday to throw out his criminal conviction on gun charges and dismiss a separate case accusing him of tax evasion based on an argument that the special counsel prosecuting him was unlawfully appointed.","url":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2024/07/18/breaking-news/hunter-biden-tries-to-toss-criminal-cases-using-trump-ruling/","image":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/web1_2024-07-18T211102Z_1967914595_RC2WX8AF96K8_RTRMADP_3_USA-BIDEN-HUNTER.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-18 23:48:00","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.151},{"id":252113578,"title":"Netizens Paint a Dark Future, Say It Is 'Obvious' That Elon Musk Bought X to Get Trump Elected","text":"The environment of social media and politics is ever-changing. There is new speculation in the market that has swept over X (previously Twitter). Many Twitter users are bluntly stating their thoughts on why Elon Musk went on to buy the platform. Speculation believes he did it solely to aid former President Donald Trump's return to power. The user @theliamnissan started the tweet saying, \"Elon bought this website to get Donald Trump elected.\" Many echoed this sentiment, with @jimmy607 asserting, \"It was never a business decision. It was never about 'free speech'. It was always about controlling narrative.\" This point suggests that there was a deeper motive for Musk to buy the platform. The discussion took on a more urgent tone after that. @quidprojlo questioned their continued use of the platform: \"At what point is continuing to use this website enabling Musk and Trump? I wish a Twitter alternative like Blue Sky managed to take off.\" Others delved into more complex theories. @r0z_75 offered a multi-faceted view: \"And fuck with our stocks, direct activating dog whistles to the appropriate demographics, do a little social engineering, sabotage a few American legacy companies (like Tesla) and command (pfft) a stellar neural network. Musksy is quite the Enterprising dark mule, amirite?\" Some users kept their responses brief but impactful. @erthcrclr simply stated, \"where's the lie,\" implying agreement with the original post. The notion that Musk's intentions were transparent from the start gained traction. @PawlowskiMario claimed, \"It was obvious for a long time, I knew it since he first mentioned that he is interested in buying Twitter.\" However, not all users agreed with these theories. @INVEST327 offered a contrasting view: \"If Elon didn't buy this app you probably wouldn't have the freedom to post that. The woke boys would've shadow banned any election tweet and push one sided advertising (propaganda).\" Some users took a more dramatic stance on the potential consequences. @LaBecs warned, \"He overpaid and didn't care about losing what's a drop in the bucket to him, so he could then own the government. I'd advise americans to start packing. It'll be fun watching the white snowflakes becoming refugees of the very countries they've looked down upon all their lives.\" @Lyrics85 added historical context, stating, \"Yup. And don't forget this happened right after getting he got banned.\" These theories come within a broader political context in which tensions between current and former leaders are simmering. President Joe Biden recently tested positive for COVID-19, causing him to issue a statement that included direct references to Musk and Trump. In a post on X, Biden said, \"I'm sick,\" before adding, \"of Musk and his rich buddies trying to buy this election. And if you agree, pitch in here.\" The letter was accompanied by photographs of Musk and Trump.","summary":"One user questioned, &#34;At what point is continuing to use this website enabling Musk and Trump?

MassGOP Chair Amy Carnevale, speaking with the Herald while attending her fourth party convention, said that before the delegates gathered in Milwaukee all that anyone wanted to talk about was President Joe Biden and the growing push for him to step aside following his disastrous display at the first debate. “Before Saturday, that subject completely dominated conversations, with people talking about which Democrats were saying he should be replaced, what it would mean, who it might be,” Carnevale said. After former President Donald Trump’s apparent near brush with death on Saturday, naturally, Trump’s health and the business of seeing through with his nomination became the central topic of conversation. “The focus was back on President Donald Trump and his health with the start of the Republican National Convention and on Republican Party priorities,” she said. But with even more calls coming from the Left for the 81-year-old Biden, currently home sick with COVID-19, to make way for a younger liberal, Carnevale said that Republicans are taking notice. “There was more of that talk last night starting with his COVID diagnosis,” she said. “It’s coming back around.” Even apart from Saturday’s apparent assassination attempt, this year’s Republican National Convention has been one for the history books, according to Carnevale. The MassGOP Chairwoman attended as a delegate in 2012, 2016, 2020, and this year as the chair of the state party. Carnevale said one major difference is the lead up to the event. This time around, it was Trump in control of the party apparatus instead of any of the attempts at the reverse, as seen in past elections. The Republican Party platform adopted by the convention, she said, “is very much a Donald Trump focused document,” down to the diction and capitalization. “I think the party seems more unified than ever,” she said. “We’ve heard from former competitors and former VP contenders over the last couple of days and their message is all the same: we have to come together to defeat Joe Biden.” Carnevale said it’s hard to convey the “sheer sense of enthusiasm and energy for the Trump-Vance ticket. Again, that’s really felt on the floor of the convention.”","summary":"“Before Saturday, that subject completely dominated conversations, with people talking about which Democrats were saying he should be replaced, what it would mean, who it might be,” MassGOP Chair Amy Carnevale said.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2024/07/18/rnc-conversations-shift-from-trump-assassination-to-bidens-dilemma/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/BHR-L-EDITORIAL.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-18 23:41:54","author":"Matthew Medsger","authors":["Matthew Medsger"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.307},{"id":252113068,"title":"Biden urged to drop out by Democratic mega-donors, while Kamala Harris attracts large crowds","text":"On a Tuesday in early July, 75 wealthy Democratic political donors gathered on a Zoom call to discuss the path forward for President Joe Biden after his calamitous debate performance against Donald Trump, according to a person on the call. Only one of the donors said they thought Biden should stay in the race, this person said. All the others made it very clear that they believed Biden needed to drop out of the race, if the party wanted to defeat Trump in November. People who spoke to CNBC for this story were granted anonymity to speak freely about a sensitive matter. Since then, big money donors who fund either the Biden campaign, his allied political action committees or the party at large have launched a lobbying campaign aimed at senior Democrats in both the House and Senate. Their goal is to convince lawmakers to publicly call on Biden to end his reelection campaign, according to over half a dozen people familiar with the matter. Many of these donors laid their positions out in stark terms: If Biden refused to drop out, they would not be giving money to help his reelection until polls showed that he was a clear favorite to beat Trump. Donors who have made these types of calls to Democrats on Capitol Hill include Hollywood executive Ari Emanuel, his brother Zeke Emanuel and Alan Jones, a senior managing director at Intermediate Capital Group and a longtime Democratic party donor, two people familiar with the matter explained. The effort set off a scramble by some of Biden’s allies to keep donors on the president’s team. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, her husband former President Bill Clinton and Biden campaign co-chair and media mogul Jeff Katzenberg have all made pleas to donors, asking them to stick with Biden, according to people briefed on the matter. Biden has repeatedly said he has no plans to drop out of the race, despite over 20 members of Congress publicly calling on him to “pass the torch,” with many more doing so in private. “I think almost every donor at this point has publicly or privately expressed their deep concern to the campaign team, to former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries,” said one longtime Biden bundler. “While Biden doesn’t really care what donors think, the leadership does, because of the impact down ballot,” the bundler added. Pelosi, Schumer and Jeffries have each reportedly warned Biden about their members’ concerns and said that his long odds in November will likely drag down congressional candidates if he stays in the race. The Biden campaign did not reply to a request for comment. Representatives for Hillary and Bill Clinton and Zeke Emanuel, likewise, did not reply to requests for comment from CNBC. A press representative for Ari Emanuel declined to comment. Jones did not return emails seeking comment. Yet Biden’s fundraising collapse does not necessarily spell doom for the party. In an unexpected twist, events that feature Vice President Kamala Harris, Biden’s likely successor should he step aside, have started to sell out. An online seating chart for a concert event with Harris in Pittsfield, Mass. on July 27 shows it is almost entirely sold out. Tickets start at $100 and go up to just over $12,000, according to the invitation.

The lawsuit, filed this week in the Western District of Texas, alleges a “pattern” of “severe or pervasive sexual harassment” going back to at least 2015 by multiple workers in the network of shelters run by the Austin, Texas-based Southwest Key. The nonprofit contracts with the federal government to care for migrants arriving in the U.S. without parents or legal guardians. Southwest Key operates 29 shelters that provide temporary housing for unaccompanied children in three states, including California. North County and East County have been locations for shelters operated by the nonprofit, which also has sites in Texas and Arizona under grants from the Department of Health and Human Services. The complaint includes alleged cases of “severe sexual abuse and rape, solicitation of sex acts, solicitation of nude photos, entreaties for sexually inappropriate relationships, sexual comments and gestures.” Southwest Key did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Justice Department said Southwest Key failed to protect the children in its care and did not consistently follow federal requirements for preventing, detecting and reporting abuse. In a 2022 case detailed in the complaint, a Southwest Key employee allegedly repeatedly sexually abused three girls, ages 5, 8 and 11, at Casa Franklin in El Paso, Texas. The eight-year-old girl said the employee threatened to kill her family if she disclosed the abuse, the complaint alleges. In another case, from 2020, an employee took a 15-year-old boy from Casa Kokopelli in Arizona to a hotel room for several days and paid him for sex acts. In both cases, the abuse was documented in Southwest Key’s own reports, according to the lawsuit. “Sexual harassment of children in residential shelters, where a child should be safe and secure, is abusive, dehumanizing and unlawful,” Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke said in a statement on Thursday. Migrant children who arrive at the border unaccompanied are housed by the U.S. government before being released to sponsors in the U.S., usually parents or close relatives. The lawsuit seeks monetary damages to compensate children harmed by the alleged harassment, a civil penalty to vindicate and a court order barring future discrimination and an order requiring Southwest Key to take appropriate steps to prevent it in the future. Individuals who believe that they may have been victims of sexual harassment or abuse at Southwest Key shelters or who have other information that may be relevant to this case, may contact the Justice Department’s housing discrimination tip line at 1-833-591-0291. There have been a record number of migrant crossings during the administration of President Joe Biden, a Democrat running for re-election against Republican Donald Trump. Since fiscal year 2021 through June of this year more than 500,000 unaccompanied minors have arrived at the U.S.-Mexico border, according to U.S. government data.

Congressional Republicans weigh in","text":"Since Sen. J.D. Vance (R-OH) became the Republican vice presidential nominee, people have commented on how President Joe Biden, 81, has been in politics longer than Vance, 39, has been alive. In 2016, Donald Trump became president without ever running for office but picked a seasoned politician, Mike Pence, to be his running mate. This time is different. Vance, a freshman senator with only nearly 18 months of office under his belt, is not a traditional pick. As voters’ trust is eroding in the government and career politicians, could a political outsider such as Vance be what unites not only the Republican Party but also moderates to this ticket? “Experience in Washington isn’t necessarily a recipe for success,” Rep. Kat Cammack (R-FL) said. “Our party has shifted away from everybody waits their turn, and it’s now your turn.” Rep. Byron Donalds (R-FL) said. Donalds believes paying your dues in politics is a dated notion and is the reason the Democratic Party is struggling. President Joe Biden ran his first campaign saying he would be a one term president; now he is facing calls to step down due to age and mental acuity. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), who was in the running for vice president, said Vance was a really good choice. “Think about the talent we have in our party that Donald Trump gets to pick from to fill out his administration,” Rubio said. “And the Democrats don’t even know who the nominee is yet.” Cammack compared Vance with Biden’s numerous years of experience. “Biden had 40 years in the Senate, and he hasn’t exactly delivered results that he’s promised.” “I think J.D. Vance will be a great complement to the president,” Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders (R-AR) said. “Vance is a powerful story, and I think he’s going to do a really great job connecting with Americans, particularly in the Rust Belt, and really fighting for the American worker, something that’s going to be really important for the November election.” “The reason why we’re a more diverse party, and a younger party than the Democratic Party is because we’re not playing the old political games of waiting your turn,” Donalds said. Donalds added Trump’s picking of Vance signals the party no longer needs to “groom” people into “fully-formed politicians.” “No, our party’s done with that,” Donalds said. “If you can do the job, and you can excel, we want you. Period. Full stop.”","summary":"Since Sen. J.D.

But a source close to Pelosi — one of the most influential members of Biden’s Democratic Party — said that Schiff’s comments “came as news” to the former speaker and that he did not consult with Pelosi before making his concerns public. A spokesman for the former speaker did not address Schiff’s comments or what Pelosi told Biden. “Speaker Pelosi respects the confidentiality of her meetings and conversations with the President,” a spokesman said in a statement. “Sadly, the feeding frenzy from the press based on anonymous sources misrepresents any conversations the Speaker may have had with the President.” Schiff said in a statement on Wednesday that he has “serious concerns” about whether Biden can defeat Republican challenger Donald Trump, the first Democrat to come out after the Saturday assassination attempt against the former president. Biden’s campaign had hoped the shooting, in which a bullet grazed Trump’s ear, would tamp down calls for him to step aside in the 2024 race before Schiff’s statement. “Nancy is all over this. She doesn’t miss. Schiff wouldn’t move without her approval,” said the White House source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Pelosi is “convinced public sentiment is against POTUS (president of the United States) and he can’t change it,” the source added. Pelosi and Schiff, a former chair of the House intelligence committee, both represent California districts in the House. The White House declined to comment. Biden’s deputy campaign manager, Quentin Fulks, said there were no plans to replace him as the Democratic nominee for the Nov. 5 election. Biden “is not wavering on anything. The president has made his decision,” Fulks said in Milwaukee on Thursday. Some Democratic lawmakers in the House and Senate have called on Biden to step aside in the race after a shaky debate performance raised questions about his fitness for the job at age 81. A Democratic aide said that Pelosi’s main “unofficial” political role for some 25 years had been to work to ensure that Democrats have a majority in the House, a chamber now narrowly controlled by Republicans. Biden’s standing among voters in swing districts based on opinion polls would make retaking the House “not a tenable situation,” the aide said. Pelosi likes to quote from a speech by former President Abraham Lincoln in leadership meetings, the White House source noted. In the speech, Lincoln said, “With public sentiment, nothing can fail; without it nothing can succeed.” The source said the push from top Democratic leaders had raised the question of whether Biden will stay in the race: “I hadn’t seen a single crack from him but now who knows?” “There is a path” to victory “but it’s going to be hard. It will not be easy for Kamala,” the source added, referring to Vice President Kamala Harris, who potentially would replace Biden as the Democratic presidential nominee.","summary":"WASHINGTON >> Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has told President Joe Biden she believes he cannot win the Nov. 5 election and backed California lawmaker Adam Schiff&#8217;s call for him to step aside, a top White House source with direct knowledge of the matter said.","url":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2024/07/18/breaking-news/pelosi-backed-lawmaker-urging-biden-to-quit-race-source-says/","image":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/web1_2024-07-18T134444Z_1512332958_RC2CJ6A4Y3WT_RTRMADP_3_USA-ELECTION-BIDEN-PELOSI.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-18 23:34:00","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.289},{"id":252112532,"title":"Release the delegates: If Democrats care about democracy, they’ll have an open convention","text":"Isn’t it ironic? For a Democratic Party that’s spent four years repeating the mantra “Democracy is on the ballot,” it turns out that may not have been the case after all — in its own nominating process. After a primary season in which only a few marginal candidates dared to challenge incumbent Joe Biden, who got roughly 14 million votes in various primaries, the calamitous last few weeks — and a conveniently timed COVID diagnosis that takes the president off the road — have led to reconsideration of Biden’s political future. Though the “stubborn” prez may not want to go, he’s being pushed by everyone who matters in his party, including former President Barack Obama, Senate leader Chuck Schumer and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. And some say it could happen this weekend, giving political reporters who might be bored after Milwaukee something to do. Democrats have several ways to handle this, and some are more boring than others. There is a case to be made that VP Kamala Harris should be the party’s de facto nominee, allowing her easy access to the Biden-Harris war chest. The pros: She’s been one heartbeat away for 3½ years, she would appeal to black voters and women, and she’s a known quantity. And if Biden releases his delegates and leaves the presidency, all the better for this play. But the gambit’s not without downside risk. The cons? She would be running on the Biden-Harris legacy, which the re-election campaign has downplayed in favor of Project 2025 hysteria and personal attacks on Trump. Harris may have a honeymoon with mainstream media as the nominee, but there is scant evidence she would juice the ticket or stop the Trump surge in states observers expected to be battlegrounds just weeks ago. And there is less evidence she would stop the GOP from expanding the map to states that haven’t been in play since Reagan’s 1984 re-election. So with Harris not being a safer option than her boss, what should Democrats do? Here’s a suggestion: Throw the nomination open, and make what was intended to be a thoroughly stage-managed Democratic National Convention next month actually matter. Dispense with the canned speeches and syrupy video packages and warnings about the other side, and do what Democrats have tried to avoid in one preordained nomination cycle after another. Spend the first few days letting candidates from that reputedly very deep Democratic bench make their case to delegates who are free to vote their consciences. Would a contested convention be good TV? You bet. It would give the next generation of Democrats a chance to stake a course for the party they really haven’t been able to in recent years, which saw strong steering currents toward Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Joe Biden in 2020 — efforts intended in both cases to deny Bernie Sanders the nomination and protect institutional power inside the party itself. They could move beyond making canned arguments against Trump and J.D. Vance and instead litigate the issues voters care about — persistent inflation, American military involvement overseas, the hollowing of the middle class. The Democrats have ceded these issues to Republicans in their fervor to maintain the fiction that a clearly deteriorated president is competent. But a contested convention would allow them to litigate those matters rather than cling to the prerogatives of the status quo. The open-convention strategy would allow Democrats to recalibrate what has been a dismal narrative in recent weeks, one their shopworn spokespeople and consultants weren’t ready for. They anticipated “lawfare” would leave Trump in court all summer. It did not. They assumed pouring money into pro-abortion messaging and other segmented marketing would keep voters on side. Polls say that’s not the case. Voters expect and deserve better than a rerun of the 2020 campaign, and Democrats won’t win with the current playbook. Their voters are less motivated than Trump backers, as survey after survey shows. With this in mind, it’s time for the political professionals to dispense with a strategy of diminishing returns, give the people a show, let the delegates do something meaningful for once and present a dynamism and unpredictability the party hasn’t seen since Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign. It’s their only hope.","summary":"For a Democratic Party that’s spent four years repeating the mantra “Democracy is on the ballot,” it turns out that may not have been the case after all — in its own nominating process.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/07/18/us-news/release-the-delegates-if-democrats-care-about-democracy-theyll-have-an-open-convention/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/joe-biden-reacts-supporters-greet-84600078_34a95a-e1721345112233.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-18 23:33:18","author":"A.g.

Biden's efforts to shore up confidence in his candidacy have failed to close the growing rift between him and his party. And while he has so far roundly rejected the calls to step aside, Biden said Tuesday that should a \"medical condition\" emerge, it could force him to rethink his decision to stay in the race. On Wednesday, Biden, 81, tested positive for Covid-19. His doctors say his symptoms are mild. Realistically, the only way to replace Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket at this stage in the campaign cycle is if he agrees to drop out voluntarily, or if he dies or suffers a \"disability.\" After breezing through the primary virtually unopposed, Biden has won almost all of his party's 4,000-plus delegates, who are selected in large part because of their loyalty and support for their chosen candidate. Those delegates are set to vote for their presidential nominee in a virtual roll call in early August, before the Democratic National Convention. If Biden ends his campaign before voting begins, the pledged delegates could cast their ballots for a new candidate. According to the DNC rules, If no candidate won a majority on that first ballot, then the more than 700 \"superdelegates\" could join in subsequent votes. The voting would then continue until one candidate won a simple majority of delegates. If Biden were to die, resign or suffer a \"disability\" after the convention adjourned on Aug. 22, then the Democratic National Committee chair — currently Jaime Harrison — would confer with top congressional Democrats and the Democratic Governors Association about a replacement, per the party rules. Harrison would then report to the committee, which \"is authorized to fill the vacancy.\"","summary":"Biden's campaign crisis has put a spotlight on Vice President Kamala Harris, who is widely viewed as the likeliest choice to replace him.","url":"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/18/biden-drops-out-what-happens-next.html","image":"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107432366-1719245191902-gettyimages-2157930600-AFP_34XZ93L.jpeg?v=1721324333","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-18 23:23:25","author":"Kevin Breuninger","authors":["Kevin Breuninger"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.016},{"id":252112134,"title":"Trump to accept Republican nomination amid turmoil over Biden's fate","text":"Donald Trump will formally accept the Republican presidential nomination on Thursday, at a time when his Democratic rival Joe Biden is struggling to fight off more doubts about his ability to run a successful campaign and serve another four-year term. Trump will deliver a speech to a packed arena of Republicans in Milwaukee before the party concludes its four-day national convention. When accepting his third consecutive presidential nomination from the party, just days after surviving an assassination attempt during a rally, Trump is expected to call for national unity to make the United States stronger and more prosperous. The 78-year-old former president is expected to present his often-heard narrative that the country was in a far better position, both domestically and internationally, when he was in office than at present under the Biden administration. He is likely to slam China for stealing American jobs through what he views as unfair trade practices, while casting himself as a guardian of forgotten communities across the United States. All the Republican convention fanfare, which will culminate with Trump's speech, comes as more Democrats have joined the mounting calls for Biden to drop out of the race for the November presidential election. The 81-year-old president has been under intense scrutiny over his physical and mental fitness since his shaky performance in a television debate with Trump in late June. But the pressure Biden is facing now seems much stronger after U.S. media reports that Democratic leaders, including former House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, have privately told him their concerns about his ability to defeat Trump and that their party is at risk of failing to regain control of the lower chamber. The Washington Post and other leading U.S. media outlets said former President Barack Obama, a close ally of Biden, has also told associates in recent days that the likelihood of the incumbent winning the election has greatly diminished. In contrast to the show of unity among Republicans, there have been widening divisions among Democrats, although Biden has been the presumptive nominee for months after cruising through the party's primaries with little opposition and its national convention in Chicago is just a month away.

Former President Donald Trump, a brash New York real estate mogul, may seem like a foil to Ivy League-educated Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio) who hails from the Rust Belt. Amber Rose, another reconstructed critic of the president, and Teamsters leader Sean O’Brien also stood out from the RNC norm—at least that of Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) or former President George W. Bush. Yet, for all the variety, it seems the Grand Old Party has unified after an assassination attempt on former President Trump. That unity is hard to separate from the former president and his “Make America Great Again” movement, one that has broken down old walls between ideologies. MAGA favorites like Kari Lake and Peter Navarro were greeted with loud applause in the Fiserv Forum. Only figures such as Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), unpopular among the former president’s base, faced hostility—in Mr. McCarthy’s case, from his foe and Trump ally Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), who initiated the former speaker’s ouster last October. “I feel bad for that as a Kentuckian,” Harvey VanHook, a local Republican official in the state, told The Epoch Times of the boos aimed at Mr. McConnell. Mr. Romney and former President Bush, avatars of an earlier Republican Party, were among those conspicuously absent. Rep. Tim Burchett (R-Tenn.) told The Epoch Times that a previous generation of Republican leaders had embroiled the United States in wars, saying they “got us killed.” John Mowery, an Alaska delegate, told The Epoch Times that the former president’s “America First agenda” set him apart from the old establishment. “I think this is about creating stability in the party,” said North Dakota state Sen. Judy Estenson. She told The Epoch Times that as a delegate at the 2016 convention, she had used her vote to back Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas). Today, though, she thinks the former president has proven himself. In his July 17 acceptance speech, Mr. Vance meditated on trade, needless war, and illegal immigration, arguing that America is a nation, not merely an idea. The Marine veteran, Yale Law graduate, and conservative intellectual told his heartland story, connecting with the RNC crowd. For all that sets him apart from the former president, Mr. Vance looked every bit the MAGA heir, including through his comments critical of high finance. “When JD said something negative about Wall Street, I could just hear the country club Republicans looking for another party,” Mr. Burchett said. Franklin Graham of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, a speaker on July 18, may have been selected to assuage those concerns. The convention provided a contrast to President Joe Biden’s candidacy, which has been questioned by some Democrats. As Republicans who squabbled throughout this Congress coalesce around their leader, once-unified Democrats appear to show signs of a splinter ahead of their August convention, which could follow a virtual nomination procedure earlier in the month. During a July 18 press conference elsewhere in Milwaukee, Biden campaign manager Quentin Fulks stressed that the commander-in-chief “is and will be the Democratic nominee.” Yet, in question after question, reporters dwelled on confirmed or rumored defections among top Democrats. Near the perimeter of the RNC, trucks paid for by the Democratic National Committee drove around blaring advertising against Mr. Vance and former President Trump. Dueling political billboards lined the highways through town.","summary":"Republicans have roundly united behind the former president who has transformed the party under his platform.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/rnc-showcases-party-remade-by-trump-5689363","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/07/16/id5687745-07152024-DSC01322-RNC-2024-Trump-Vance-Donalds-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-18 23:15:48","author":"Nathan Worcester","authors":["Nathan Worcester"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.019},{"id":252113630,"title":"Dem Sen.

Joyce Beatty (D-Ohio), campaign surrogate, told reporters at a news conference in Milwaukee. Ms. Beatty said she is confident that Democrats will unite behind President Biden, referring to the calls for him to step down as “family discussions” among the Democratic coalition. “I am very comfortable that we will be more unified because we understand that diversity is our strength and we are a party of diverse individuals, but we also recognize greater than that, that unity is our power,” she said. On July 17, media reports revealed that top Democrats, including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), had spoken separately with the president to raise concerns about the possibility of Democrats losing control of Congress in 2024 and advise him to reconsider his reelection bid. In response to these reports, campaign surrogate Sen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) said the party will eventually unite behind President Biden at the Democratic National Convention, which starts on Aug. 19. “We will unite. Our convention is still a few weeks away, but it'll be here before you know it,” he said. “Then you’re going to see the unity during the Democratic National Convention.” The senator was asked about reports suggesting that Mr. Schumer asked the president to drop out of the race during a private discussion on July 13. Mr. Padilla said that as Democrats, “of course, there’s going to be a little diversity in what folks are thinking and feeling,” but stressed a difference in strategy between Senate and presidential campaigns. “Yes, our incumbents in some of the tougher states are facing tougher elections, but they’re doing well,” the senator said. “And I do think there is a difference between the presidential campaign politics and strategy and state-by-state Senate campaign politics and strategy.” T.J. Ducklo, senior adviser for communications for the Biden campaign, referred to the reports about lawmakers calling for the president to drop out as “baseless conjecture from anonymous sources.” Andrew Bates, the White House senior deputy press secretary, also responded to the reports about Mr. Schumer and Mr. Jeffries. “The President told both leaders he is the nominee of the party, he plans to win and looks forward to working with both of them to pass his 100 days agenda to help working families,” he said in a statement. On July 18, Mr. Bates responded to another report, which stated that President Biden is under pressure to reconsider his reelection bid and could drop out of the race as early as this weekend. He also shared a post stating that, on the contrary, the president is “preparing to hit the campaign trail again next week.” Speculation has started to build since Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) issued a surprise statement on July 17, asking President Biden to pass the torch. Mr. Schiff told the Los Angeles Times in a statement that he now has “serious concerns” about President Biden’s chances of defeating former President Trump in November. He said that although the decision to drop out of the race ultimately lies with the Democratic incumbent, he believes “it is time for him to pass the torch.” Amid growing concerns, Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), in a July 17 social media post, urged Democrats to stop attacking President Biden. “Fellow House Democrats, can we in this moment unify, show some decency, and simply wish @POTUS a speedy and full recovery?” he wrote on X after the president tested positive for COVID. “Please do not use this moment to advance your own political agenda by launching more private or public attacks on Biden.”","summary":"‘Incorrect.

Only one of the donors said they thought Biden should stay in the race, this person said. All the others made it very clear that they believed Biden needed to drop out of the race, if the party wanted to defeat Trump in November. People who spoke to CNBC for this story were granted anonymity to speak freely about a sensitive matter. Since then, big money donors who fund either the Biden campaign, his allied political action committees or the party at large have launched a lobbying campaign aimed at senior Democrats in both the House and Senate. Their goal is to convince lawmakers to publicly call on Biden to end his reelection campaign, according to over half a dozen people familiar with the matter. Many of these donors laid their positions out in stark terms: If Biden refused to drop out, they would not be giving money to help his reelection until polls showed that he was a clear favorite to beat Trump. Donors who have made these types of calls to Democrats on Capitol Hill include Hollywood executive Ari Emanuel, his brother Zeke Emanuel and Alan Jones, a senior managing director at Intermediate Capital Group and a longtime Democratic party donor, two people familiar with the matter explained. The effort set off a scramble by some of Biden’s allies to keep donors on the president’s team. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, her husband former President Bill Clinton and Biden campaign co-chair and media mogul Jeff Katzenberg have all made pleas to donors, asking them to stick with Biden, according to people briefed on the matter. Biden has repeatedly said he has no plans to drop out of the race, despite over 20 members of Congress publicly calling on him to “pass the torch,” with many more doing so in private. “I think almost every donor at this point has publicly or privately expressed their deep concern to the campaign team, to former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries,” said one longtime Biden bundler. “While Biden doesn’t really care what donors think, the leadership does, because of the impact down ballot,” the bundler added. Pelosi, Schumer and Jeffries have each reportedly warned Biden about their members’ concerns and said that his long odds in November will likely drag down congressional candidates if he stays in the race. The Biden campaign did not reply to a request for comment. Representatives for Hillary and Bill Clinton and Zeke Emanuel, likewise, did not reply to requests for comment from CNBC. A press representative for Ari Emanuel declined to comment. Jones did not return emails seeking comment. Yet Biden’s fundraising collapse does not necessarily spell doom for the party. In an unexpected twist, events that feature Vice President Kamala Harris, Biden’s likely successor should he step aside, have started to sell out. An online seating chart for a concert event with Harris in Pittsfield, Mass. on July 27 shows it is almost entirely sold out.

This campaign season, as President Biden and his party face a potential electoral beat-down, expect the most corrupt churches to transform into brothels — pimping out the holy pulpit to the politician of the moment to spread a campaign agenda instead of God’s word. Just this month, Biden once again played Democrat “john,” paying handsomely to penetrate the ears of a black Christian congregation for political gain. The president visited Mount Airy Church of God in Philadelphia, a predominantly black church, on July 7 as he tried to improve his faltering poll numbers amongst black voters a week after his humiliating debate failure. These black churches are all too willing to politicize God in exchange for fleeting acknowledgment from the Democratic power structure. And when Democrats are mired in scandal, dropping in the polls or trying to crawl back into office, predominantly black churches and black religious figures enthusiastically bless them and gravitate to their secular power. A black Christian flock in The Bronx put itself up for sale in March, when disgraced former Gov. Andrew Cuomo needed an audience to climb back into political relevancy while leaving his own sins unquestioned. Back in 1998, Rev. Jesse Jackson embraced then-president Bill Clinton after his sexual improprieties came to light: There is no limitation on the sin that can be washed away by a reverend with a political agenda. Jackson went so far as to provide vague exonerations on Clinton’s behalf. “He is embarrassed by whatever happened, however one defines inappropriate,” the reverend assured CNN. My personal favorite is when Democrats develop a sudden southern twang when addressing a black church audience. Summoning The Unholy Democratic Spirit is apparently enough to induce the most inauthentic vocal drawl to impress a compromised congregation. This convenient spirit touched Hillary Clinton in 2008, when she proclaimed that she “Don’t feel no ways tired” as she unsuccessfully battled Barack Obama for the Democratic presidential nomination. It even transformed Bronx Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez into a Southern Baptist preacher when she spoke at Rev. Al Sharpton’s National Action Network in 2019. This month, as Biden’s polling results amongst black voters dwindled, his campaign brushed off the tired playbook and received the blessing of Bishop J. Louis Felton and Mount Airy’s church leadership. Biden gave a standard campaign speech loaded with promises, saying that if re-elected, he would “ensure that the economy has the lowest black unemployment and more black small businesses in decades. To rebuild and ensure black America has the peace of mind that comes with health care for everybody.” But Bishop Felton felt the need to explain the faltering president’s presence. “We are firm believers in [the] separation of church and state. We are separated but we are not divorced,” Felton said. “Since we are not divorced, we still have visitation rights. The president has a right to be here.” What a double standard: While the bishop believes in keeping the church from involvement in the state’s activities, he’s perfectly fine with representatives of the state using the church for its secular bidding. Bishop Felton can attempt to rationalize Biden’s supposed “visitation rights” to the pulpit — but Biden’s purpose was not to worship with the flock, but to use them as racial pawns in hopes of elevating his public perception among black American voters. I expect a callous career politician like Joe Biden to use every advantage he can to reach the demographics he needs to win. But he can’t use God’s house as a political platform unless Christian enablers allow him to. One of my fundamental issues with many predominantly black churches is that they often seem to believe that being black is more important and relevant than being Christian. And as they attempt to serve multiple masters, they become susceptible to a message that caters to the current moment in secular society. In a contentious election year, that means corrupted churches welcome self-serving politicians to exploit their holiness. The Democrats are repeat-customer “johns” who participate in the prostitution ring of black identity politics, enabled by self-anointed black leaders who use religious faith to pimp for votes. They put our sought-after black identity up for sale to the highest bidder, and their greed constantly usurps their discernment as they allow the invocation of God to sanctify racial and political dogma. When a bishop stands in front of a congregation during Sunday worship and repeatedly uses the word “we” to demonstrate his allegiance to one political party, you know which master he’s chosen to sacrifice for. You cannot serve both God and politics. Adam B.

The Republican campaign has even been talking up Trump's chances in Democratic strongholds like Minnesota and Virginia, potentially forcing Biden funds and manpower away from defending his \"blue wall\" in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.Trump's keynote address will be watched by millions, closing the convention by promising what his team calls \"a new golden age for America.\"The four-day party convention opened Monday with a vote to confirm Trump as the party's nominee after he won almost every state's primary contest.It has been the first convention over which Trump has had total control, after a 2016 edition hampered by party divisions and a second appearance in 2020 reined in by the Covid-19 pandemic.The schedule was designed around his image, with themes for each day playing on his \"Make America Great Again\" rallying cry.The week also saw Trump name right-wing Senator J.D. Vance of Ohio as his running mate.The 39-year-old author of \"Hillbilly Elegy,\" a best-selling memoir about growing up poor in working-class America, is a former Trump critic who became one of his staunchest backers.Trump himself was a diminished figure after his 2020 election loss and a subsequent riot at the US Capitol by his supporters, but he has spent much of the last four years reshaping Republican politics.","summary":"Donald Trump will get a hero's welcome Thursday as he accepts the Republican Party's presidential nomination in a speech capping a convention dominated by the recent attempt on his life.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com.au/trump-rally-unified-republicans-convention-finale-1849699","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com.au/en/full/1854202/son-former-us-president-donald-trump-donald-trump-jr-speaks-during-2024-republican-national.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-18 23:06:16","author":"Michael Mathes","authors":["Michael Mathes"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":0.073},{"id":252111494,"title":"Trump and Vance’s unique problem: WHO are they running against?","text":"With Donald Trump formally accepting the Republican nomination and J.D. Vance confirmed as the pick for vice president, the GOP table is set for a November showdown, but their campaign faces an unprecedented problem: They don’t know who they’re running against. Trump senior adviser Brian Hughes cut to the heart of it Wednesday in a statement declining one plan for a vice presidential debate: “We don’t know who the Democrat nominee for Vice President is going to be, so we can’t lock in a date before their convention.” Twisting the dagger, he added: “To do so would be unfair to Gavin Newsom, JB Pritzker, Gretchen Whitmer, or whoever Kamala Harris picks as her running mate.” Indeed: The Democrats are flailing in internal fighting over whether and how to drop President Biden, leaving the whole ticket entirely uncertain. Well-sourced reports have ex-Speaker Nancy Pelosi working hard behind the scenes to try to shake Biden out, with top Senate and House Dems Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries joining in; even former President Barack Obama has jumped on the “drop out, Joe” bandwagon (albeit, by once again “leading from behind”). Many donors are on strike until Biden quits the race. Amid rumors that he might drop as soon as this weekend, some fear he’ll keep on refusing. That could force top Democrats to the extreme measure of invoking the 25th Amendment to put Veep Kamala Harris in charge, which would also free up convention delegates otherwise sworn to him. At this point, Harris seems the near-certain replacement atop the ticket; among other things, other possibles won’t want to damage their own futures by serving the party as a sacrificial lamb in an election they’d be almost guaranteed to lose. Replacing Biden also means finding a new veep pick: Harris either moves up or is humiliated by being passed over, and the new ticket needs balancing, anyway. And, again, it won’t be made official until the convention starts Aug. 19. Plus, all of this looks pretty undemocratic for a party that’s made “threats to democracy” it’s main campaign them, hence the talk of holding debates before the convention, or at it, to make any behind-closed-doors insiders’ pick look kosher. The only certainty is at least some chaos is guaranteed, along with aggravating delays. Trump and Vance know what they’re opposing; four years of Democrats’ disasters handed them the message on a silver platter: We’ll clean up this mess.

(Photo by Jacek Boczarski/Anadolu via Getty Images) Anadolu via Getty Images Key Facts Trump is scheduled to speak at 10 p.m. EDT from the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee. Former First Lady Melania Trump is expected to appear at the convention for the first time Thursday to hear her husband’s speech, one of her first official appearances on the campaign trail during her husband’s third run for president. The speech will mark the first time Trump has spoken publicly since he was shot at his rally Saturday in Pennsylvania (he spoke at a private event in Milwaukee on Wednesday, telling supporters “God was with me.”) Trump has attended the prime-time speeches during the previous three days of the convention, with a bandage covering the bullet wound to his right ear; he appeared visibly emotional as he entered the arena Monday, marking his first major public appearance since the assassination attempt. Former Fox News personality Tucker Carlson, retired wrestler Hulk Hogan and Ultimate Fighting Championship President Dana White are among the speakers scheduled for prime-time addresses before Trump takes the stage. What To Watch For Trump rewrote his speech in the wake of the assassination attempt to focus less on attacking President Joe Biden and more on a message of unity, he told The Washington Examiner over the weekend. “This is a chance to bring the whole country, even the whole world, together,” Trump said. Key Background Trump’s speech comes as the presidential race could undergo another drastic change in the coming days as some top Democrats expect President Joe Biden will end his reelection bid following the backlash from his June 27 debate performance, Axios reported. Trump will accept the nomination Thursday as he has widened his lead over Biden to three points—a 1.5-point increase since the June 27 debate, according to RealClearPolitics’ polling average. Tangent Trump’s speech comes after Ohio Sen. JD Vance made his national debut as Trump’s running mate at the convention Wednesday, delivering a speech that leaned heavily on his Rust Belt roots in an appeal to Midwestern voters. Tuesday’s convention line-up featured several ex-Trump foes, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who endorsed Trump for the first time since she ran against him in this year’s GOP primary. Further Reading What Time Is Trump Speaking?

It seems to me that a law prohibiting notification of parents when a minor child starts using different pronouns and identifies as a different gender further erodes parents’ rights to know and guide their children. A child who changes their gender identity at school is already “out.” And yet the parents are the last to know? As a psychotherapist for 40 years, I have treated hundreds of minor children. Everything we discuss in therapy is confidential, aside from suicidal or homicidal intentions. And yet, if there is an issue I think parents should be informed about, I encourage the minor child to inform their parents themselves, often with my assistance in a conjoint therapy session with the child and parents together. Maybe that would be a better law, with services provided by school counselors. Greg Salerno San Jose Replacing Harris may calm Biden fears Re: “Harris in ‘awkward position’ with support for Biden” (Page A1, July 10). The articles being written about an aging but defiant President Biden seeking re-election tiptoe around a fundamental fact. If the Biden-Harris ticket stays as is, American voters increasingly anticipate that Biden won’t make it through 2028. Thus, voting for Biden means voting for Kamala Harris to assume the presidency sometime in the coming four-plus years. The problem is that Kamala Harris is unelectable. She has never distinguished herself with notable accomplishments at any level, created no legacy, really done little but prove to be a decent, able politician — but in the eyes of the electorate, not presidential material. For Biden to win, Harris must step aside and pave the way for a new vice president, someone who can generate excitement in this dreadful Trump-Biden rematch, someone the electorate will see as far better presidential material than Trump. Of course, such an occurrence is Trump’s worst nightmare, but what fun it could be. Kirch DeMartini Saratoga Bold change needed for Democratic ticket There is no doubt that this election is existential. After witnessing the debate and reading several recent articles, I’ve come to the conclusion that the best thing for the country is for Joe Biden to step down. I believe that what is best is Gov. Josh Shapiro for president (we need Pennsylvania) and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer for vice president (we need Michigan), with Vice President Kamala Harris for attorney general. We need a change.

Instead, the square, an official protest zone located a few blocks from the Republican National Convention, was like a scene from some postapocalyptic tale. This afternoon’s designated protest zone was a wide, mostly empty expanse of lush grass. In the middle stood a charming gazebo equipped with a microphone and sound system. But nobody appeared to be speaking. Orange-shirted security staff paced the premises, but they really could have saved their energy. There was no one to secure. “We thought there would be people,” Stephen, a white-bearded protester from Janesville, Wisconsin, who preferred I use only his first name, told me. He’d just arrived with two friends, who were both blinking at the empty space. “I don’t even see a dog.” You can usually expect plenty of picketing at party conventions—even though the protesters are banished, in this post-9/11 world, far beyond the Secret Service’s safety perimeter. Protesters swarmed the streets at the 2016 RNC in Cleveland; thousands of anti-war demonstrators marched on the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver. That energy was conspicuously absent in Milwaukee, where Republicans appeared more and more confident. Five days ago, a man tried to kill their leader. Now here they were, in the land of beer and cheese, celebrating Donald Trump’s survival and the consolidation of the party behind his nomination. They were busy drinking free old-fashioneds at the CNN/Politico Grill—and perhaps even scrolling Zillow for townhouse prices in D.C. This is an extremely weird moment for Democrats at all levels of the party. It’s confusing, because the demands to replace President Joe Biden on the ticket have been waxing and waning for weeks—without any satisfying resolution. Democratic staffers, operatives, and members of Congress keep telling reporters—albeit anonymously—that they are going to lose. This strange brew of emotions, cycling between hope and hopelessness, seems to be affecting grassroots Democrats too. This week in Milwaukee, only one major demonstration has occurred: a modest-sized march on Monday afternoon, before Trump arrived in the city. Organizers estimated that 3,000 people had shown up that day, although some local news reports suggested numbers in the high hundreds. It was a “decent attendance,” Omar Flores, co-chair of Coalition to March on the RNC 2024, told me. Many demonstrators were not registered Democrats. Some were socialists; others were pro-Palestinian activists angry with Biden. The march coalition had had to file a lawsuit and fight with the city for a protest permit so close to the convention center. Yet after the march, and all that negotiating, the activity died down. “I was kind of surprised,” Christine Sinicki, a Wisconsin state representative and the chair of the Milwaukee County Democrats, told me. “I thought, with all the legal battles, they would be protesting every day of the RNC.” (When I asked Flores, the organizer, where he and his allies had gone, he was defensive. Monday’s march took two years to plan, he said, and “all of us have full-time jobs.”) News of straggler events came to me via whispers: Somewhere outside of the venue, one colleague had seen an esoteric performance-art demonstration about the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 involving sand. I was sad to have missed it. Otherwise, the streets surrounding the convention have been quiet, save for the occasional tipsy delegate or errant reporter. If fascism is imminent, then where was everybody? That’s what Nadine Seiler was wondering. The 59-year-old had come all the way from Waldorf, Maryland, to be one of two protesters standing on a street corner near a Secret Service checkpoint, where attendees and reporters like me were entering the convention. “I Googled it, and America has at least 200 million adults over 18 years old,” she said. “Why, with democracy on the line, are there only two of us here?” Seiler wore hot-pink lipstick and a T-shirt that read July 13 was a false flag. She told me that she didn’t actually believe that Republicans had staged the Trump assassination attempt. But Republicans had blamed January 6 on the FBI, so two could play that game. Democrats are “gutless and spineless,” she told me. “I am done being polite, and I am done being sane.” This does not appear to be the reaction of most Democrats. Instead, in the aftermath of Saturday’s shooting in Butler, Pennsylvania, which resulted in the death of one rally-goer, Democrats have been lying low. Sinicki, the Milwaukee chair, said her team had canceled several local party events this week, in an effort to turn down the political temperature. The sense of defeatism is strong. “I’ve been speaking with some top Democrats,” the reporter Robert Costa said on CBS News. “They believe that those Democrats who have concerns about President Biden are now standing down politically.” A Democratic source told Semafor that Trump “was already on track to win and the fact that he is now a victim of political violence rather than the perpetrator undermines Biden’s core appeal.” But the few Democrats who showed up to protest at the RNC seem moved to action by that desperation. Another gaggle of Biden supporters who, like Stephen, had planned to spend the day at Zeidler park arrived yesterday looking bewildered. Was there supposed to be a gathering here today? I asked. “We were certainly hoping that,” Jane, who came from North Milwaukee and, like others, chose to give only her first name, told me, “because I know that a lot of people feel as we do.” They’d seen a city website beforehand that suggested speakers would be appearing every 20 minutes. Obviously, no one had signed up to do so. Still, Jane was undaunted. “I decided to be hopeful today,” she said. “Democrats understand clearly what is at stake, and I think that they will figure out how to make that message be communicated, and energize people, because that’s really what needs to happen.” Kim, a friend of Jane’s visiting from Vermont, looked around at the empty park. “I’m not quite as optimistic,” she said. She paused. “But I believe that the better nature of people will prevail.” There may be reason for optimism—a change in the works. The Democratic National Committee this week delayed a vote that would have made replacing Biden more difficult, and Democratic leaders appear to be pressing him to stand down. Regardless, here in Milwaukee, the streets are mostly quiet. Jane, Kim, and the others had laughed when I asked whether they had a moment for an interview. Here in the empty park, their carefully drawn signs resting on the grass, they had nothing but time.","summary":"They’re acting as if they already lost the election.","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/07/democrats-protest-republican-convention/679105/","image":"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/ZABhg-HdiELh7P9zrnELIJVAKho=/0x0:2995x1560/1200x625/media/img/mt/2024/07/GettyImages_2161684537/original.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-18 23:00:00","author":"Elaine Godfrey","authors":["Elaine Godfrey"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.218},{"id":252111290,"title":"Top Democrats, including Obama and Pelosi, raise concerns about Biden’s candidacy for 2024 Election","text":"Former President Barack Obama has privately expressed concerns to Democrats about President Joe Biden’s candidacy, and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi warned Biden that Democrats could lose the ability to seize control in the House if he didn’t step away from the race.

He is expected to accept his third consecutive party nod in prime time before thousands of supporters at Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee. Trump’s running mate JD Vance addressed the same crowd on Wednesday. Meanwhile, President Joe Biden’s reelection campaign insists it’s “not working through any scenarios” where he “is not the top of the ticket,” despite intensifying calls from congressional Democrats for him to abandon the race ahead of November’s election. Follow the AP’s Election-2024 coverage at: Here’s the Latest: Retired pro wrestler Hulk Hogan to speak at RNC, AP source says Retired wrestling star Hulk Hogan is slated to speak Thursday night at the Republican National Convention ahead of President Donald Trump’s historic remarks accepting his party’s nomination for president after facing an assassination attempt. He is just one of several members of the wrestling world expected to speak on the convention’s final day, including Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO Dana White, according to a person familiar with the schedule who spoke on the condition of anonymity before the schedule’s official release. Earlier this week, Florida Rep. Byron Donalds compared Trump’s return to the RNC stage after the assassination attempt to “Hulk Hogan at WrestleMania.” Hogan, whose legal name is Terry Gene Bollea, and Trump are both members of the World Wrestling Entertainment Hall of Fame with the former president being inducted in 2013. The 1980s wrestling icon has occasionally tossed around political aspirations after he retired from wrestling in 2012, including telling Fox News last month that he’d consider entering politics. “So, if you need a president or vice president, I’ll volunteer and take this country over, and I’ll rule with an iron fist, a flat tax — nothing but common sense,” he said. Hogan has won six WWE championships and starred in movies and TV shows including “No Holds Barred,” “Suburban Commando” and “Hogan Knows Best” after amassing a fan base dubbed the “Hulkamaniacs.” Trump campai gn official: Secret Service director should resign One of Trump’s top campaign officials says the Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle should resign. Chris LaCivita, one of two officials serving effectively as Trump’s campaign manager, was asked in an interview hosted by Politico and CNN on Thursday whether Cheatle should resign, and he said, “Yeah.” He added: “100%.” LaCivita wouldn’t answer questions about Trump’s injury or his conversation with the former president after the shooting. Obama, Pelosi and others push for Biden to reconsider 2024 race Former president Barack Obama has privately expressed concerns to Democrats about Biden’s candidacy. And Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi has privately warned Biden that Democrats could lose the ability to seize control in the House if he didn’t step away from the race. This is according to several people familiar with the private conversations who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive internal matters. Biden has insisted he is not backing down. Pressed about reports that Biden might be softening to the idea of leaving the race, Biden’s deputy campaign manager Quentin Fulks said Thursday: “He is not wavering on anything.” ___ Associated Press writers Zeke Miller, Lisa Mascaro, Mike Balsamo and Aamer Madhani contributed to this report. US Sen. Coons: ‘I don’t have anything to tell’ about Biden staying in the race Sen. Chris Coons, the closest friend of President Joe Biden in Congress and the co-chair of his reelection campaign is confronting questions from reporters Thursday about Biden’s political future at the Aspen Security Forum in Colorado, where the Delaware Democrat is one of many U.S. officials speaking. Coons’ had been a staunch supporter of Biden in recent days. Thursday, asked about Biden staying in the race, Coons told the AP, “I don’t have anything to tell. I don’t know,” shaking his head. Court commissioner orders competency exam for man accused of carrying concealed firearm near RNC A court commissioner in Milwaukee has ordered a competency examination for a 21-year-old man accused of carrying a concealed firearm near the Republican National Convention. Prosecutors charged Donnell Tinsley on Tuesday with a misdemeanor count of carrying a concealed weapon without a permit. According to a criminal complaint, federal agents stopped Tinsley on Monday as he was walking near the convention’s security zone after noticing he was wearing black pants and a ski mask and was carrying what the complaint described as a “large black tactical backpack.” The agents searched him and found an AK-47-style pistol that can fire rifle rounds in the backpack. Online court records indicate that Tinsley’s attorney, public defender Elizabeth Ellsworth-Kasch, raised questions about whether Tinsley was competent to proceed during a court hearing Wednesday. Court Commissioner Jeralyn Wendelberger ordered Tinsley to undergo a competency exam with a report due by Aug. 6. Tinsley remains in custody. Ellsworth-Kasch didn’t immediately respond to a voicemail or an email seeking comment on the case on Thursday morning. Trump’s speech will be a ‘message about uniting the country,’ Florida delegate says Emotions and excitement at the convention have been building each day and will culminate Thursday night when Trump is expected to accept the Republican nomination for president, according to Blake Bell, a 40-year-old delegate from Florida and self-described “big Trump guy.” “Being on the floor Monday when Trump came in, everyone had chills because it was the first appearance he made since the attempted assassination,” Bell said Thursday morning. “And tonight will be a historic speech. I know there won’t be a dry eye in the crowd.” Bell said he thinks the tone of Trump’s speech will be different, adding that it “will be much more of a message about uniting the country.” “I think there were a lot of people, even before Saturday, who were afraid to come out and say ‘I’m a Donald Trump supporter,’” Bell said. “I think it has been a stigma that the media has tried to put on people to make them feel embarrassed or ashamed that they support Donald Trump. I think on Saturday, after the assassination attempt, people woke up and they said, ‘We’re not ashamed anymore to say that Donald Trump is what’s best for this country.’” Trump has written his own speech for Thursday’s address at RNC, AP source says Trump has written his own speech for Thursday night’s address and it is expected to be more personal than his usual comments, according to two sources familiar with the planned remarks who were not authorized to speak publicly. Trump’s speech on the last night of the Republican National Convention is also expected to lay out a stark contrast with the Democrats’ policies, which Republicans plan to make clear they are as much Harris’ as Biden’s. ___ Associated Press writer Michelle L. Price contributed to this report. Biden isn’t ‘wavering’ when it comes to his reelection, deputy campaign manager says President Joe Biden’s reelection campaign insists it’s “not working through any scenarios” where he “is not the top of the ticket,” despite intensifying calls from congressional Democrats for him to abandon the race ahead of November’s election. “He is, and will be, the Democratic nominee,” Quentin Fulks, principal deputy manager of Biden’s reelection campaign, told a Thursday news conference in Milwaukee, where the Republican National Convention is being held. Asked about reports that Biden might be softening to the idea of bowing out amid mounting pressure from his own party, Fulks said, “He is not wavering on anything.” “The president has made his decision. I do not want to be rude, but I don’t know how many more times I can answer that,” Fulks told reporters. “There are no plans being made to replace Biden on the ballot.” Biden campaign: ‘The president is feeling fine’ President Joe Biden is feeling fine and working while isolating in Delaware as he recovers from COVID-19, his campaign says. “The president is feeling fine,” Quentin Fulks, principal deputy manager of Biden’s reelection campaign, told a news conference on the sidelines of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. Fulks added that Biden is “continuing to make calls and do work. He has official meetings today, a lot of campaign calls that he’s getting through, and I think some Zoom calls that he’s hoping on potentially.” Biden was campaigning in Las Vegas when he tested positive for the virus on Wednesday and flew to Delaware where he is self-isolating at his home in Rehoboth Beach. Pulp fiction? Vance unexpectedly references Tarantino film to illustrate his faith Vice presidential nominee JD Vance chose an unlikely reference to illustrate his spirituality to an audience of influential Christian conservatives Thursday morning. “I want to leave you with one more final thought and it comes from one of my favorite theologians, the character Jules in the movie, ‘Pulp Fiction,’” Vance told those gathered for the Faith and Freedom Coalition breakfast at the Pfister Hotel in Milwaukee. “Sorry, this will make sense in a second.” Vance went on to describe a scene where the character, played by Samuel L. Jackson, is fired upon at point-blank range repeatedly but escapes unharmed. Jackson’s character, a hardened hitman, is moved by what he describes as a miracle, as Vance described, and argues with his partner “whether God had come down from heaven and stopped these mother-eff— bullets — that was the exact phrase,” Vance said. “What matters is, I felt the touch of God,” Vance recited from the Jackson character’s line. Turkey’s Erdogan speaks with Trump on call, denounces assassination attempt as ‘attack on democracy’ ANKARA, Turkey — Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke with Donald Trump on Thursday, a conversation in which he denounced the assassination attempt against the presidential candidate as an “attack on democracy.” During the call, Erdogan praised Trump for his “brave stance following the heinous attack,” according to a statement from the Turkish presidential communications office. The Turkish leader also said the fact that Trump had pressed ahead with his schedule despite the attack had “strengthened democracy.” Erdogan added that Trump had “displayed strong leadership through his comforting messages of unity that aimed at reducing polarization and tensions,” according to the statement. Erdogan expressed hope that the elections in November would be “beneficial” to Americans and to Turkish-US relations. Erdogan had forged a good rapport with Trump during his presidency while U.S. President Joe Biden has kept a distance from the Turkish strongman leader. House Speaker Johnson calls on Biden to fire Secret Service director House Speaker Mike Johnson is ramping up the pressure on U.S. Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle, calling on President Biden to fire her for security failures in the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump. Johnson had already called for Cheatle to step down but says it’s clear she has no intention of doing so. “I think there has to be accountability and it begins at the top. This is ridiculous,” Johnson said Thursday during a Fox Business interview. Johnson also described a telephone briefing that Cheatle and FBI Director Christopher Wray provided lawmakers on Wednesday, saying “they did not give us satisfactory answers to some very important questions” while also acknowledging that some of the information may need to be discussed in a classified setting. Vance: ‘Social conservatives have a seat at this table and always will’ Ohio Sen. JD Vance made his first public appearance Thursday since accepting the Republican vice presidential nomination Wednesday, speaking at an evangelical Christian breakfast where he described the winding path to his faith. He told roughly 1,000 influential social conservatives that he once considered himself an atheist, but marrying and some early influences from the devout grandmother who raised him set him on the course to his Christian faith. Vance also addressed uneasiness stemming from the Trump campaign’s effort to streamline the Republican Party platform, which, until this month, had for 40 years called for a national abortion ban. “There has been a lot of grumbling in the past few weeks that the Republican Party of now and the Republican Party of the future is not going to be a place that’s welcoming to social conservatives,” Vance told attendees. “And, really, from the bottom of my heart, that is not true. Social conservatives have a seat at this table, and always will so long as I have any influence in this party, and President Trump, I know.” The breakfast was hosted by the Faith and Freedom Coalition at the Pfister Hotel, a late Victorian downtown monument. Democrats make a fresh push for Biden to reconsider running in runup to their own party convention WASHINGTON — Democrats worried about President Joe Biden’s ability to win this November are making a renewed push for him to reconsider his reelection bid, using mountains of data, frank conversations and now, his own time off the campaign trail after testing positive for COVID, to encourage a reassessment. Biden has insisted he is not backing down, adamant that he is the candidate who beat Republican Donald Trump before and will do it again this year. But publicly and privately, key Democrats are sending signals of concern and some hope he will assess the trajectory of the race and his legacy during this few days’ pause. ▶ Read more about the push for Biden to reconsider his reelection bid Biden dismisses idea that it’s too late for him to recover politically President Joe Biden is dismissing the idea that it’s too late for him to recover politically, even as he faces increasing pressure to bow out of the race. In a radio interview with Univision’s Luis Sandoval that airs Thursday, Biden says it’s still early and that many people don’t focus on the election until September. “All the talk about who’s leading and where and how, is kind of, you know — everything so far between Trump and me has been basically even,” Biden said in an excerpt of the interview. Some national polls do show a close race, though others suggest Trump with a lead. And some state polls have contained warning signs too, including a recent New York Times/Siena poll that suggested a competitive race in Virginia. Convention brings an around-the-clock boat patrol to the Milwaukee River Instead of the usual kayakers and tour boats, the Milwaukee River this week is full of around-the-clock patrol boats, some with heavily armed officers. The 24-hour patrols will continue until the Republican National Convention wraps up Thursday night. Associated Press journalists observed the effort aboard a 29-foot (9-meter) U.S. Coast Guard boat as it traveled near the secure zone of the convention site via Lake Michigan and the river that empties into it. Within an hour, the Coast Guard boat had passed vessels from Milwaukee police, state conservation wardens and a heavily armed specialty Coast Guard tactical force in camouflage gear. The patrols are part of a massive security plan that Milwaukee police, the U.S. Secret Service and others have been detailing for more than a year. “There is no higher level of security that can be invested in events such as this,” Milwaukee Police Chief Jeffrey Norman told the AP on Wednesday. What would make Joe Biden drop out of the presidential race? Here are the four reasons he’s cited President Joe Biden has made it clear basically any which way you ask him: he’s definitely, assuredly, “one thousand percent” staying in the presidential race. But in response to questions from journalists over the last few weeks, the embattled Democratic president has given some clues as to what could make him step aside — especially as the calls from his own party to end his candidacy continue unabated. Here are the things Biden has cited — some serious, others not — that would make him reconsider his run: Divine intervention: “I mean, if the Lord Almighty comes out and tells me that, I might do that,” Biden said in an interview with ABC anchor George Stephanopoulos. Cold, hard data: No politician ever wants to lose — and it seems Biden would be willing to exit if he had numerical proof that that’s what would happen. A fateful accident: “Unless I get hit by a train” was Biden’s response to an interviewer’s question last week about staying in the race. A not-yet-diagnosed medical ailment: “If I had some medical condition that emerged,” Biden told BET journalist Ed Gordon. “If doctors came to me and said, ‘You got this problem, that problem.’” ▶ Read more about what Biden has said about dropping out of the race Trump says he’s rewritten his remarks for his RNC speech tonight Republicans throughout the week in Milwaukee have suggested the combative former president take a gentler tone in light of the shooting and have suggested the crisis provides a chance to de-escalate the divisive political rhetoric that has marked the 2024 campaign. Donald Trump told the Washington Examiner that he had rewritten his acceptance speech in the wake of the Saturday shooting, emphasizing a call for national unity. “The speech I was going to give on Thursday was going to be a humdinger,” he said. “Had this not happened, this would’ve been one of the most incredible speeches,” aimed mostly at the policies of President Joe Biden. “Honestly, it’s going to be a whole different speech now,” he said. Any such dialing down by Trump will come before a delegation, many of whom have been moved by Trump’s own defiant words in the grasp of U.S. Secret Service agents Saturday, and have sparked their echo in the form of chants of “fight, fight, fight.” “I do believe that after going through that his message will be better, and I do think he will appeal to our better emotions,” Pennsylvania Republican Party Chairman Lawrence Tabas said. “He has an enormous compassion and empathy that doesn’t always come through.” ▶ Read more about what to watch on day 4 of the RNC Hundreds attend vigil for man killed at Trump rally in Pennsylvania before visitation Thursday Hundreds of people who gathered to remember the former fire chief fatally shot at a weekend rally for former President Donald Trump were urged to find “unity” as the area in rural Pennsylvania sought to recover from the assassination attempt. Wednesday’s public event was the first of two organized to memorialize and celebrate Corey Comperatore’s life. The second, a visitation for friends, was planned for Thursday at Laube Hall in Freeport. Outside Lernerville Speedway in Sarver, where the vigil was held for Comperatore, a sign read: “Rest in Peace Corey, Thank You For Your Service,” with the logo of his fire company. On the rural road to the auto racing track — lined with cornfields, churches and industrial plants — a sign outside a local credit union read: “Our thoughts and prayers are with the Comperatore family.” ▶ Read more about the vigil for Corey Comperatore ‘One screen, two movies’: Conflicting conspiracy theories emerge from Trump shooting A former president is shot, the gunman quickly neutralized, and all of it is caught on camera. But for those who don’t believe their eyes, that’s just the start of the story. For some supporters of former President Donald Trump, the failure of the Secret Service to prevent the attempted assassination points to a conspiracy orchestrated by President Joe Biden. For some of Trump’s critics, however, the details of the shooting don’t add up. They wonder if Trump somehow staged the whole thing. Two dueling conspiracy theories are taking root online following Trump’s attempted assassination, one for each end of America’s polarized political spectrum. In this split-screen republic, Americans are increasingly choosing their own reality, at the expense of a shared understanding of the facts. “One screen, two movies,” is how Ron Bassilian describes the online reaction to Saturday’s shooting. Bassilian is a prolific user of social media and has used X to broadcast his conjecture about the shooting. “People have their beliefs, and they’re going to come up with theories that fit their beliefs.” ▶ Read more about the conspiracy theories surrounding the Trump shooting Families of service members killed during Afghanistan withdrawal criticize Biden at GOP convention Relatives of some of the 13 American service members killed during the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan appeared on stage at the Republican National Convention Wednesday in an emotional moment that revived one of the low points of President Joe Biden’s presidency. Many of the Gold Star families have criticized Biden for never publicly naming their loved ones. On stage Wednesday, one of the family members named each of the 13 service members, and the crowd echoed back each name as it was read aloud. “Joe Biden has refused to recognize their sacrifice,” Christy Shamblin, the mother-in-law of Marine Sgt. Nicole Gee, told the crowd. “Donald Trump knew all of our children’s names. He knew all of their stories.” The crowd chanted “Never forget!” and “U.S.A.!” as Trump and the entire convention hall stood. ▶ Read more about the Gold Star families featured at the RNC JD Vance mad e a direct appeal to his native Rust Belt in his VP nomination speech JD Vance introduced himself to a national audience Wednesday after being chosen as Donald Trump’s running mate, sharing the story of his hardscrabble upbringing and making the case that his party best understands the challenges facing struggling Americans. Speaking to a packed arena at the Republican National Convention, the Ohio senator cast himself as a fighter for a forgotten working class, making a direct appeal to the Rust Belt voters who helped drive Trump’s surprise 2016 victory and voicing their anger and frustration. The 39-year-old Ohio senator is a relative political unknown, having served in the Senate for less than two years. He rapidly morphed in recent years from a bitter critic of the former president to an aggressive defender and is now positioned to become the future leader of the party and the torch-bearer of Trump’s “Make America Great Again” political movement. The first millennial to join the top of a major party ticket, Vance enters the race as questions about the age of the men at the top — 78-year-old Trump and 81-year-old President Joe Biden — have been high on the list of voters’ concerns. He also joins Trump after an assassination attempt against the former president — in which Trump came perhaps millimeters from death or serious injury — underscoring the importance of a potential successor. ▶ Read more about Vance’s RNC speech It was (sort of) JD Vance’s night … but it’s still Trump’s convention The third nights of conventions are traditionally about the running mate and how they round out a presidential ticket. Certainly, Vance has become a presence at the convention — mentions from the podium, his name now on signs together with Trump, appearances with the former president on the first two nights of the convention. But Trump is a dominant figure — even when measured against other U.S. presidents and world leaders. Pick any speaker Wednesday and their most passionate pitches were not about “Donald Trump and JD Vance.” They were about Trump. “This is a man I know and the president we need for four more years,” said Kellyanne Conway, a former Trump adviser. “He will always stand up for you.” Trump’s former White House physician, Rep. Ronny Jackson of Texas, called Trump “the greatest president this country has ever had” and “a president who even took a bullet for our country.” It’s Trump’s party and his alone. No running mate can change that, especially not a freshman senator who has yet to celebrate his 40th birthday. ▶ Read the AP’s takeaways from night 3 of the RNC. Day 3 of the convention has ended The convention is gaveling out after a benediction from Rev. Packy Thompson of Houma, Lousiana. Thompson thanked God for Trump. “I also thank you for protecting him from the evil that was perpetrated last Saturday,” he said. And the gathering is adjourned until Thursday. Biden campaign issues a blistering statement immediately following Vance’s speech “Tonight, J.D. Vance, the poster boy for Project 2025, took center stage. But it’s working families and the middle class who will suffer if he’s allowed to stay there,” Michael Tyler, Biden campaign communication director, said. “Backed by Silicon Valley and the billionaires who bought his vice presidential selection, Vance is Project 2025 in human form – an agenda that puts extremism and the ultra wealthy over our democracy.” Vance ends VP nomination speech: ‘I will give you everything I have’ Vance made a pledge to voters: “I pledge to every American, no matter your party, I will give you everything I have.” He added, “To serve you and to make this country a place where every dream you have for yourself, your family and your country will be possible once again.” After the speech, Vance’s extended family flooded the stage to an unusual song for a Republican convention – Fleetwood Mac’s “Don’t Stop Thinking About Tomorrow.” The song became a political staple in 1992 when a very different young politician from a humble background ran for national office. That was Bill Clinton, who is, of course, a Democrat.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nFormer President Barack Obama has privately expressed concerns to Democrats about President&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Top Democrats, including Obama and Pelosi, raise concerns about Biden&#8217;s candidacy for 2024 Election first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/top-democrats-including-obama-and-pelosi-raise-concerns-about-bidens-candidacy-for-2024-election/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/rewrite-this-title-2024-Election-Latest-Obama-Pelosi-and-other.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-18 22:59:28","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.065},{"id":252112174,"title":"Nancy Pelosi thinks Joe Biden is close to dropping re-election bid, report says","text":"Former House of Representatives speaker Nancy Pelosi has told some House Democrats she believes US President Joe Biden can be convinced fairly soon to exit the White House race, The Washington Post reported on Thursday, citing three Democratic officials familiar with her private discussions. Pelosi told them that she thinks Biden is getting close to deciding to abandon his presidential bid, the newspaper said. Multiple Democratic officials think an exit is a matter of time, according to sources familiar with the matter. “His soul searching is actually happening, I know that for a fact,” said one of the sources, who requested anonymity. “He’s thinking about this very seriously.” Biden, 81, has faced increasing pressure from heavyweights in his party to cede his position at the top of the ticket after a shoddy debate performance against former US president Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, raised fears about his age and ability to win in November. The president has pushed back defiantly against those calls, arguing that he has won millions of votes in primary races over the last several months and is Democratic voters’ choice. As recently as Wednesday, he vowed “I am all in” the 2024 race. Another of the sources, a Democratic congressional aide, said the writing appeared to be on the wall for the president after lawmakers including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer reportedly urged him to drop out of the race. “It feels like it’s a matter of … when, not if,” the aide said. Democratic Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, a close Biden ally, told CNN on Thursday that Biden will be “resting and reflecting” this weekend as he recovers from Covid-19. He has been asking for information on polling data and weighs seriously the input of those he trusts and admires, Coons said, adding he thinks Biden is the best candidate to run in 2024. Biden is convalescing at his home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. He had no public events on Thursday after concluding a trip to the political swing state of Nevada on Wednesday. Biden’s campaign is focusing on three out of seven battleground states after the debate, a narrow path to victory, but it has rejected suggestions that he is ready to step aside. “He is not wavering on anything. The president has made his decision,” deputy campaign manager Quentin Fulks said in Milwaukee, where the Republican convention is taking place. “Joe Biden has said he is running for president of the United States. Our campaign is moving forward.” Another source, a Biden campaign official, said the opposite. “Yes, it’s over. Just a matter of time.” Democratic Senator John Hickenlooper of Colorado said he believed that Biden was working toward a decision on whether to stay in the presidential race and would opt for what is good for the country. “Joe Biden has always put the country first. He’s done what’s best for America … I think he’ll keep doing so,” Hickenlooper said late on Wednesday, adding there are indications it would be best for the US if he stepped aside. Pelosi backed congressman Adam Schiff’s call for Biden to step aside, a top White House source with direct knowledge of the matter said. But a source close to the former speaker – one of the most influential members of Biden’s Democratic Party – said that Schiff did not consult Pelosi before making his concerns public.","summary":"The once-defiant US president is now ‘soul searching’ about stepping aside, one insider says.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3271022/nancy-pelosi-thinks-joe-biden-close-dropping-re-election-bid-report-says","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/07/19/cff66e89-faf7-4481-8bdd-9d71f770f496_58f93fd8.jpg","video":"https://storage.scmp.com/d8/cors_uploads/2024/07/18/Video.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-18 22:58:10","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.131},{"id":252112634,"title":"At RNC, Trump's inner circle adamant they can turn Minnesota red for first time since 1972","text":"MILWAUKEE – Minnesota was the talk of former President Donald Trump's orbit during the Republican National Convention. RNC Co-Chairwoman Lara Trump told Pennsylvania delegates she now considers the North Star state a battleground state, Trump GOP pollster Tony Fabrizio told Florida delegates Minnesota is a toss-up and Trump senior advisor Chris LaCivita said during a breakfast in Milwaukee that polling has indicated Minnesota is \"consistently plus two.\" In announcing JD Vance as his vice presidential pick, Trump said on his Truth Social account that the first-term senator from Ohio would likely appeal to voters in the Midwest, including Minnesota. Their RNC remarks came as the Trump campaign has started ramping up its efforts to flip Minnesota in November. Rep. Tom Emmer, Trump's state chair, solidified the claim from the RNC stage this week, saying he is confident Minnesota will \"make history this November when we turn Minnesota red for the first time in 50 years.\" The Trump campaign just hired two top staffers in Minnesota and announced it plans to open eight field offices in the state. And recent polls on the race have been close. \"We think we are going to win Minnesota,\" Minnesota GOP deputy chair Donna Bergstrom said. \"We just feel, people are at the breaking point where they're seeing gas prices keep going up, inflation going up.\" When the Trump campaign put Minnesota on its radar as a new pickup opportunity to expand its chances, it also added Virginia. On Tuesday evening, a number of Trump-endorsed Republican U.S. Senate candidates took the RNC stage, including Hung Cao from Virginia. But missing from the stage was another top of the ticket candidate: Royce White, Minnesota's Republican-endorsed Senate candidate, who has faced a slew of controversies. He has not received Trump's backing and it's unclear if he will. \"These Senate candidates are projected to win their seats,\" Kelly Fenton, a former Republican Party deputy chair and state legislator, said as the other Republican Senate candidates took the stage. \"I believe that the Senate race in Minnesota is currently not winnable. Is it possible that Trump flips Minnesota in the presidential? Yes. But I do not think that the Senate candidate is included in that. But all of these other candidates speaking, those seats that they're running in are winnable.\" White's campaign did not respond to a request for comment on whether he was invited to attend the RNC. Heading into November, President Joe Biden's debate performance and standing in recent polls is playing in Trump's favor across the map, said Larry Jacobs, director of the University of Minnesota's Center for the Study of Politics and Governance. He said the exception could be in Minnesota. \"Those favorable conditions for Donald Trump may be offset by a Royce White candidacy,\" Jacobs said. \"[He's] a weak candidate who's got a troubled record up against a candidate killer in Amy Klobuchar, who's popular, has got a large war chest and a powerful campaign organization.\" Jacobs said, adding that the \"Klobuchar effect\" may offset some of the favorable conditions that are helping Trump in other states. Jacobs was referring to Klobuchar's effect on down-ballot races. A Star Tribune analysis of historical voter data found a correlation between election years when Klobuchar is on the ballot and better results in Democrats in other races. Klobuchar has consistently won a larger percentage of the vote than other statewide candidates, and every year she's run, the DFL has won whichever chambers of the Legislature were on the ballot. Bergstrom disagreed with Jacobs, saying she does not think White will drag down Trump. \"I think the top of the ticket is where everybody is focused,\" she said, adding that White still has to make it through the August primary election, where former Navy intelligence officer Joe Fraser is also running on the GOP side. Regardless of who wins the Republican Senate primary, Minnesota DFL chairman Ken Martin said he thinks the Trump campaign's confidence about flipping the North Star state is misplaced. The state hasn't voted for a Republican presidential candidate since Richard Nixon in 1972. Early voting for the presidential election starts in just two months, and Martin said he's yet to see the Trump campaign establish a field operation in Minnesota. The Trump campaign had set up shop in Minnesota by this point in 2016 and 2020, but not this year, Martin said. \"We've had offices open in this state for several months now, over 20 offices. We have hundreds of organizers on the ground, thousands of volunteers every single day talking to voters,\" Martin said. \"You can talk all you want about how you're going to put Minnesota into play, but I haven't seen anything yet that suggests they're serious about that.\"","summary":"Trump campaign officials said at the RNC this week they're targeting Minnesota.

Six Quotes That Say He May Be","text":"President Joe Biden is facing calls to withdraw from the presidential election amid concerns about whether he can win in November, with several news outlets reporting that he has become more open to the idea.Calls for Biden, 81, to step aside began following the CNN Presidential Debate against former President Donald Trump last month in Atlanta, Georgia. Biden sounded hoarse and appeared to stumble through several answers, doing little to quell concerns about his age. Critics argue that he should pass the torch to a younger Democrat, such as Vice President Kamala Harris.However, Biden has maintained that he is staying in the race. His campaign said he had a cold the night of the debate and have sought to dispel questions about his fitness by having him do a number of interviews and public appearances in the weeks following the debate. But polls, which have shown Trump leading key swing states, still show Biden trailing.Several news outlets reported this week that Biden may be becoming more open to stepping aside, most citing anonymous sources.

Roger Marshall (R-KS) insisted that “for once in Joe Biden’s term, someone should be held responsible” regarding the Secret Service failing to stop the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump on July 13. Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle made an appearance at the Republican National Convention, prompting several Republican lawmakers to confront her and ask her more questions about how a 20-year-old was able to bypass the Secret Service and almost assassinate Trump. While the Secret Service is still investigating the security breakdown, Marshall told the Washington Examiner it may have been a result of a total collapse in the organization’s culture due to diversity, equity, and inclusion mandates. “Do you realize that half of the Secret Service officers quit last year?” Marshall told the Washington Examiner. “The year before that, half of them quit. These are 8,000 dedicated officers that are trying to protect 33 people, and they’re failing at their job. I think because [Cheatle] is more focused on hiring people with DEI than people that are competent to do the job.” There is no evidence to suggest any DEI mandate caused the security breakdown that allowed the former president to be shot. Marshall said the reason so many different conspiracy theories surrounding the failed assassination are running rampant is because the public doesn’t trust the government. “Americans have no confidence,” Marshall said. “The way you gain confidence back is by being fully transparent as possible.” So far, Cheatle has resisted calls for her resignation, but Marshall said she must be held accountable. “For once in Joe Biden’s term, someone should be held accountable,” Marshall told the Washington Examiner. “I’ve never been a part of any organization when I see a huge cultural problem and you don’t have to get rid of the head of the snake.” Haisten Willis contributed to this report.","summary":"EXCLUSIVE — Sen.

But for those who don’t believe their eyes, that’s just the start of the story. For some supporters of Donald Trump, the failure of the Secret Service to prevent the attempted assassination of the Republican former president points to a conspiracy orchestrated by Democratic President Joe Biden. For some of Trump’s critics, however, the details of the shooting don’t add up. They wonder if Trump staged the whole thing. Two dueling conspiracy theories are taking root online following Trump’s attempted assassination, one for each end of America’s polarized political spectrum. In this split-screen republic, Americans are increasingly choosing their own reality, at the expense of a shared understanding of the facts. “One screen, two movies,” is how Ron Bassilian describes the online reaction to Saturday’s shooting at a Pennsylvania rally. Bassilian is a prolific user of social media and has used X to broadcast his conjecture about the shooting. “People have their beliefs, and they’re going to come up with theories that fit their beliefs.” Bassilian is one of many Republicans now questioning how the shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks, was able to climb to the roof of a building providing a clear shot at Trump and whether law enforcement looked the other way to allow the attempt. Bassilian acknowledged that he doesn’t have proof to back up his conjecture. But the Culver City, California, resident said many people will be distrustful of explanations until an independent review of the facts is completed. “It seems highly suspicious,” Bassilian said of the attack on Trump and the law enforcement response. “Something was going on that was more than a slip-up.” Authorities have released no information about Crooks’ possible motive, though they have said they believe he acted alone. But a lack of details from law enforcement and mounting questions about the Secret Service’s performance have led online sleuths to speculate — often in ways that reveal their own ideological leanings. Some of the claims about the shooting have already been debunked. Despite claims that the Secret Service refused to give Trump extra security before the rally, the agency says it actually increased staffing. A post from someone claiming to be a law enforcement sniper at the rally — who said they were ordered not to fire on the shooter — was discredited after it turned out no sharpshooter by his name was working on Saturday. And a photo that supposedly showed an uninjured Trump after the rally turned out to be a picture from 2022. Humans have an inherent drive to share information and conjecture following big events like disasters, political assassinations or seemingly inexplicable events — a process experts call “collective sensemaking.” Often, experts say, we look for information that makes us feel safe or in control of uncertainty. Trump’s attempted assassination is only the most recent example on a list that also includes the JFK assassination, the moon landing, the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, the Sandy Hook school shooting, COVID-19 and the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Many of the claims about the Trump assassination attempt emerged first on fringe social media platforms like 4chan before migrating to larger sites like X or TikTok, where they were seen by far more people. “Rumoring under these conditions is a normal thing that humans do,” said Kate Starbird, a University of Washington professor who studies misinformation and how people use the internet following crises. Attempts to put the shooting in a political context began within minutes of the shooting, Starbird said: “People tried almost from the beginning to frame the event in a way that benefits their political goals.” Many of those rumors may contain exaggerations, missing context or outright falsehoods that generate conspiracy theories. The misleading information is then amplified by online trolls, politicians, internet influencers and online merchants trying to hawk merchandise tied to the assassination attempt. With few guardrails in place to combat bad information online, such claims can quickly spread, impacting the election in 2024 and potentially persisting for years to come. The flood of false or misleading information about the shooting will only make it harder for voters to find trustworthy information ahead of the 2024 election, according to Imran Ahmed, the CEO and founder of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, a nonprofit that tracks online misinformation and hate speech. Ahmed blames social media platforms for not enforcing basic content moderation policies and for making the spread of misinformation and hate speech into a lucrative business model. Social media platforms have recently pulled back from content moderation efforts designed to prevent the spread of misinformation. While some sites like Facebook and Instagram still prohibit information that could interfere with the operations of an election, others like X rely on other users to correct falsehoods. Ahmed’s group analyzed 100 posts about the shooting that were recommended to users on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, and found that many contained conspiracy theories. Only about 1 in 20 false posts had been flagged for inaccuracies or missing context using X’s “community note” feature to add needed information. In two days, the posts had been seen more than 215 million times. Some of the viral posts also contained hate speech, such as those suggesting Saturday’s shooting was a plot by Jewish people. “The algorithms take the most outlandish content and amplify it exponentially until the entire digital world is flooded with conspiracism, disinformation and hate,” Ahmed said. As a result, he said, “People seem to feel that they can only fight lies with more lies.” Russian state media and some pro-Kremlin influencers are already seizing on the shooting with content blaming Democrats for what happened or questioning authorities’ explanations, based on recent posts from users with ties to Russia. “Almost makes you think they let it happen and then got rid of the guy because dead men tell no tales,” wrote John Mark Dougan, a former Florida sheriff’s deputy turned online influencer who now writes pro-Kremlin content. Russia, as well as China and Iran, have used social media disinformation in the past in efforts to undermine Americans’ trust in government and democracy and increase polarization ahead of elections. The goal is to exploit the understandable confusion, anger and concern that many Americans feel following the attempted assassination. Federal officials say they expect Russia and other adversaries to expand their disinformation campaigns targeting the U.S. as November nears. Conspiracy theories have played an outsize role in recent American politics, and much of the attention has focused on right-leaning theories like QAnon, a movement that claims without evidence that Democrats are involved in a global ring of Satanic, child molesting cannibals. But the onslaught of misinformation and conspiracy theories following the attempted assassination show conspiracy theories know no party. “They target the left and right, and the same goes for homegrown domestic sources of misinformation,” said David Salvo, a senior fellow and managing director of the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a Washington-based group that tracks foreign disinformation. He has this advice for anyone interested in finding reliable, trustworthy information about the shooting: “Check your sources, and check the agenda behind those sources.”","summary":"WASHINGTON  — A former president is wounded in a shooting, the gunman quickly neutralized, and all of it is caught&#8230; Continue reading &#8216;One Screen, Two Movies&#8217;: Conflicting Conspiracy Theories Emerge from the Trump Rally Shooting\n\n\nThe post &#8216;One Screen, Two Movies&#8217;: Conflicting Conspiracy Theories Emerge from the Trump Rally Shooting appeared first on The National Herald.","url":"https://www.thenationalherald.com/one-screen-two-movies-conflicting-conspiracy-theories-emerge-from-the-trump-rally-shooting/","image":"https://www.thenationalherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/supporters-gop.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-18 22:41:09","author":"Antonis","authors":["Antonis"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.069},{"id":252112460,"title":"Trump Is Hoping J.D. Vance Will Help Him Win With One Key Demographic","text":"In choosing Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance as his running mate, presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump made his campaign strategy clear: boys, boys, boys. White working-class men were key to Trump’s victory in 2016, and Biden’s ability to peel off some of their support was one reason he won in 2020. Now Trump seems to be doubling down on the strategy of catering to disaffected men—mostly white ones, but also Black and Hispanic men and young men. He’s doing so to some degree in policy, promising to close the border to immigrants, whom he paints as physically dangerous to vulnerable white women and economically threatening to the forgotten white men. But Trump is just not much of a policy guy; he’s an entertainer and a symbol-maker, equal parts savior and avenger, a man onto whom fans can project all sorts of hopes and inclinations. And as such, his appeal to men is much more about masculine performance and cultural signaling than about expertise, competence, or even a loose plan of action. Which is why Vance, perhaps the least qualified and least experience vice presidential nominee in decades, may have appealed to Trump. Vance brings no practical skill set to the ticket. Yes, he could pull more money from Silicon Valley billionaires, but he doesn’t promise to deliver any key state (Ohio, where Vance is a senator, was already Trump’s) or bring along any new demographic (white men are already Trump’s). Instead, he supplies youth and vigor, masculine embitterment, and white male rage. (“Even at my best, I’m a delayed explosion,” he wrote in his bestselling memoir Hillbilly Elegy.) And that, Trump’s campaign has banked, is enough to win the election. Perhaps it’s even enough to give the MAGA movement a second life once Trump is gone. MAGA is a movement of both gender traditionalism and cartoonish machismo, rejecting the compassionate conservatism of George W. Bush’s evangelical Christianity for the muscular reactionaryism of Jacked Jesus. Trump’s sexism and his poor treatment of women in his personal life have been extensively documented; Vance has been outspoken about his particular ire for women who have an insufficient number of children, as well as for mothers who work outside the home. (Vance has three children and, until his candidacy was announced, his wife worked a demanding job at a law firm.) He has complained that childless women have too much power, griping, “We are effectively run in this country, via the Democrats, via our corporate oligarchs, by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they’ve made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable too.” He has argued that “a healthy ruling class” must be made up of people with children. And since he has also suggested that mothers shouldn’t prioritize working in demanding roles—“If your worldview tells you that it’s bad for women to become mothers but liberating for them to work 90 hours a week in a cubicle at the New York Times or Goldman Sachs, you’ve been had,” he tweeted just after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade—he has insinuated, effectively, that the ruling class should be made up of men. These views are, obviously, alienating to a lot of women. But they may be surprisingly appealing to disaffected men who feel that their rightful place at the top of the social, political, economic, and familial hierarchies should be restored. A lot of recent data has, in fact, shown that there is a huge self-defined masculinity gap between Republicans and Democrats, with Republican men much more likely than Democratic ones to say that they are “very masculine” (54 percent vs. 33 percent), according to a 2022 American Enterprise Institute survey. According to that same survey, Black and Hispanic men look a lot more like Republicans than Democrats when it comes to ideas about their own manliness: 55 percent of Black men and 52 percent of Hispanic men also say they are “very masculine.” In 2023 a Politico magazine/IPSOS poll of just over 1,000 people found that one of the biggest predictors of support for Trump is a belief that men are besieged by an anti-male culture—that men’s roles and masculinity itself are under attack. Trump performs his tough-guy routine for this group of men, who hold tight to their masculine identities. Vance speaks directly to them. In Vance’s Republican National Convention speech, his first as the VP pick, the Ohio native emphasized this men-first strategy. He stressed that Americans need a leader who “answers to the working man.” This election isn’t about him, he intoned: “It’s about all of us, and it’s about who we’re fighting for.” Who is that? He listed off three archetypes: “the autoworker in Michigan,” “the factory worker in Wisconsin,” and “the energy worker in Pennsylvania and Ohio.” Women, of course, are autoworkers, factory workers, and energy workers. But these jobs are heavily coded as blue-collar and male, and it’s not hard to read between the lines and see that when Vance speaks about the working class, he means exactly what he said early on in his speech: that he’s talking about the working man. As for women, well, Vance did say, “Our movement is about single moms like mine, who struggled with money and addiction but never gave up.” Which is an interesting way to introduce his own mother on the national stage but hardly a familiar, inspiring, or even particularly accurate picture of American women, single moms or not. The women that Vance talked about were all members of his own family. In fact, the only time the word woman showed up in his speech was when he was talking about his grandmother, and the only working woman he referenced was his wife (“Usha, an incredible lawyer and a better mom”). Men, on the other hand, merited specific mention as tradesmen who had lost their jobs, as the patriots who had signed up for military duty after 9/11, and as the workers a Trump presidency will answer to. It’s hard to believe that this wasn’t an intentional nod to the people Vance hopes will get behind him. Even before picking Vance, Trump was running way ahead with men. In early July, after his debate against President Joe Biden, Trump saw a surge of male support, with 58 percent of respondents in a New York Times/Siena College poll saying they would vote for him, and just 31 percent backing Biden. Women are not so enthusiastic: Biden retains a lead with female voters, although the margins are not nearly as dramatic. Most polls don’t break out support by race and gender combined, but Trump also leads among white voters, 56 percent of whom are supporting him—a trend that suggests he has particularly strong backing from white men. And he seems too to be making inroads with men of color. Again, the most recent and reliable polls are not granular enough to break down the preferences of Black and Hispanic men vs. women (or older voters of color vs. younger ones), but voters of color without college degrees are surprisingly split: Biden leads this cohort by just 7 points, with 40 percent supporting Trump. But voters of color without college degrees are more likely to be male than female. In other words: While Black voters are still strongly pro-Biden and Hispanic voters remain more pro-Biden than pro-Trump—and while white voters are much more pro-Trump than any other racial group—the data suggest that when it comes to Trump’s making inroads among voters of color, he’ll have the best luck with men. Vance has similar strengths. In his 2022 senate race, Vance won 58 percent of male Ohio voters, including 62 percent of married men, 64 percent of white men, and nearly 15 percent of Black men. This, in a traditional campaign sense, makes Vance a poor choice for the vice presidency. If Trump is trying to win over more voters, he has much more room to grow with women. From 2016 to 2020, he increased his support from white women, while Biden gained among white men. This year, though, women have been flocking to Democrats in the wake of abortion bans and other instances of GOP hypermisogyny. Trump himself knows that abortion politics are the GOP’s weak spot, which is why he has forced the party to be more deceptive about its opposition to abortion rights in its 2024 platform. But winning back women is apparently a lower priority than emphasizing MAGA masculinity. And elections, after all, are about both turnout and persuasion. In choosing Vance, Trump seems to be betting that he can increase male turnout by fanning the flames of masculine discontent and perhaps persuade some Democrats and independents that they too are better represented by the party of men. Finally, leaning so heavily on masculine power is also a strategy particularly calibrated in opposition to Biden. Trump is by no measure a healthy young man and has rarely received praise (other than from himself) for his mental acuity. But voters really are worried not just about Biden’s age but about his stamina and his physical and cognitive abilities. And some may be swayed further still by Vance, whose appeal rests partly in his youth, especially when compared to Biden. (Vance is 39.) Male voters are much more likely than female ones to strongly believe that Biden is simply too old to be president—60 percent of them say so, according to Times polling. And just 21 percent say the same of Trump. Putting a much younger man on the ticket reinforces Trump’s core message: He and Vance are red-blooded American males, and this is no country for old men. (Vance, for his part, has leaned into the role as well: When the Chinese spy balloon was floating over the U.S., Vance posted a photo of himself on social media pointing a gun at the sky.) Nor, the Trump ticket suggests, is it one for middle-aged women. Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris is much younger than Biden. But she’ll be 60 by Election Day. Vance will be 40—making him, if he and Trump win, one of the youngest vice presidents in American history. In Vance, disgruntled men may see someone who stands up for, and stands in for, their return to greatness. Trump’s conservative base may see a man who can carry the MAGA movement for years to come. Whether that’s enough to counteract the damage the GOP has done with female voters is a gigantic question. But in choosing Vance, Trump has laid his cards on the table, and he’s going all in on the guys.","summary":"This choice was for the boys.","url":"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2024/07/vance-trump-rnc-dana-white-ufc-abortion-women-men-gender.html?via=rss","image":"https://compote.slate.com/images/f3fe2cef-678d-44dc-bdd3-249b636f4d45.jpeg?crop=2000%2C1333%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-18 22:34:22","author":"Jill Filipovic","authors":["Jill Filipovic"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.017},{"id":252111014,"title":"Melania and Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner board flight to Milwaukee to watch Donald accept the Republican nomination for President","text":"EXCLUSIVEMelania and Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner board flight to Milwaukee to watch Donald accept the Republican nomination for President READ MORE: Follow all the politics news with DailyMail.com's live blog By Emily Goodin, Senior White House Correspondent Published: 23:31 BST, 18 July 2024 | Updated: 23:33 BST, 18 July 2024 e-mail 2 View comments Melania and Ivanka Trump, along with Jared Kushner, were spotted boarding Trump Force One for the flight to Milwaukee to watch Donald Trump accept the Republicans' presidential nomination. The trio boarded Trump's private plane in Newark for the two hour and 35 minute flight. They will be cutting the timing close. Trump is scheduled to address the delegates at 9 pm ET. Neither Melania nor Ivanka are scheduled to speak on Thursday night even though both spoke at previous Republican conventions and had the option to address this year's. For the flight, Melania wore a dark shirt and light skirt. Ivanka wore a blue dress. Jared appeared to carry a garment bag and a backpack. Melania Trump boards Trump Force One The Trump family spends the summer at the Trump International Golf Course in Bedminster, N.J. The various couples have private homes on the estate. Both Melania and Ivanka were there when Trump was shot on July 13th. And both women have stayed in the shadows as Donald Trump competes for a second term in the White House. Melania Trump only has appeared publicly with her husband for campaign events just three times: his campaign kickoff in November 2022 at their Mar-a-Lago home, in March when she accompanied her husband to vote in the Florida presidential primary, and in April when she appeared at his side at a high-dollar fundraiser in Palm Beach. Read More Biden holes up with Jill in Delaware during COVID battle as campaign plans event next week In March, as she walked into the polling place, Melania was asked then if she would join the former president on the campaign trail. Her response: 'Stay tuned.' Melania Trump notably skipped the first presidential debate in Atlanta. Trump walked off the stage alone while Joe Biden was accompanied by Jill Biden. Meanwhile, Ivanka opened up about her decision to leave politics in a rare interview. In an hour-long interview with Lex Fridman, she said she wanted to spend more time with her three children and, after four years of serving in her father's White House, felt like she 'left it all on the field.' 'I spent four years in Washington. I feel like I left it all on the field. I feel really good about it and I feel really privileged to have been able to do what I did,' she said. She said, however, she is father's top supporter, as the former president battles multiple legal cases. 'On a human level, it's my father and I love him very much, so it's painful to experience, but ultimately, I wish it didn't have to be this way,' she said. Ivanka was a senior advisor in Trump's administration from 2017 until 2021, but she has not been heavily involved in his second bid for the White House. When Donald Trump announced his bid for re-election last year, Ivanka said in a statement posted to social media that she loved her father but would be staying out of politics. Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner board Trump Force One She was not at his announcement speech. Nor did she attend the first presidential debate. 'I love my father very much. This time around, I'm choosing to prioritize my young children and the private life we are creating as a family,' the former White House adviser said. 'While I will always love and support my father, going forward I will do so outside the political arena,' she said at the time. She and husband Jared Kushner have worked to distance themselves from the tumultuous world of politics amid Donald Trump's re-election campaign and his various legal woes.

The current secretary of the interior is Deb Haaland. She is the first Native American to serve as a cabinet secretary.When asked by Native Voice One, a broadcast corporation that highlights the voices of indigenous people, on Wednesday in Milwaukee who should be the secretary of the interior under another possible Trump administration, Boebert said, \"I think Lauren Boebert needs to be secretary of the interior. President Trump, I would like to be secretary of the interior.\"I think this is actually one of the most important agencies within the federal government. Public lands are something that are very dear to me and I've spent a lot of time on our tribal lands with our chairman and our councilmembers there with the Mountain Utes and the Southern Utes,\" Boebert said.Boebert called herself \"pro-fossile fuels\" and said that \"our tribal lands are impacted severely when we are shutting down our coal-fired energy plants.\"\"States like Colorado, we have some of the cleanest coal in the entire world, and that affects those tribal lands down the road that are getting energy, and they're forced to burn wood in some areas, which we know is as much dirtier, a much dirtier way to produce heat,\" she said.Boebert advocated for oil and gas drilling, which exposes people who live near drilling sites to pollutants daily.\"In one of my tribal lands, we have a lot of drilling that takes place and I believe that that is a cleaner way to take care of the environment and extract those resources that we have been blessed with to use what's given to us by the earth to produce this energy in a clean and efficient way rather than just covering it up with solar panels and wind turbines killing so many vital species,\" Boebert said.Newsweek reached out to Boebert's office via email for comment.While wind turbines kill birds, studies have shown that oil and gas drilling is worse for the species as it destroys their habitats.President Joe Biden has made tackling climate change a major priority and promotes clean energy. In June, the Biden administration released updated plans \"that expand agency efforts to ensure their facilities, employees, resources, and operations are increasingly resilient to climate change impacts like extreme weather.\" The plans were developed by over 20 federal agencies including the U.S. Department of the Interior.","summary":"Bobert said Trump should pick her as secretary of the interior if he wins the presidential election in November.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/lauren-boebert-secretary-interior-donald-trump-rnc-1927320","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2431960/lauren-boebert.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-18 22:32:32","author":"Rachel Dobkin","authors":["Rachel Dobkin"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.022},{"id":252111190,"title":"Lou Dobbs, former Fox Business and CNN host, dead at 78","text":"Lou Dobbs, a former Fox Business and CNN host who was a vocal supporter of Republican former President Donald Trump, has died at the age of 78, his friends and a statement posted on his social media account said today. “The Great Lou Dobbs has just passed away,” Republican presidential candidate Trump said on his Truth Social platform. He added: “Lou was unique in so many ways, and loved our Country.” The cause and place of his death were not disclosed in the statements. The Emmy- and Peabody Award-winning journalist joined CNN at its inception in 1980 and held several positions at the cable network, including anchor of “Lou Dobbs Moneyline” and “Lou Dobbs Tonight.” Fox News Media, in a statement after his death, called him “an incredible business mind with a gift for broadcasting, (who) helped pioneer cable news into a successful and influential industry.” Harvard-educated Dobbs became one of the most divisive figures in U.S. broadcast journalism and over the years drew ire from Latino leaders and civil rights groups for frequent on-air remarks about U.S. border control and immigration that critics saw as demonizing undocumented immigrants. He was also seen as lending credence to the “birther” conspiracy theory, whose adherents believed that former President Barack Obama’s Hawaiian birth certificate was faked to hide a Kenyan birthplace that would have made the first black U.S. president ineligible for his office. Dobbs acknowledged his commentary also stirred friction with CNN executives. He joined the Fox Business Network in 2010 after leaving CNN in 2009. A weekday show he hosted on Fox Business was canceled in 2021 after the vocal supporter of Trump was named as a defendant in a defamation lawsuit filed by voting machine maker Smartmatic, which argued that three Fox hosts, including Dobbs, falsely accused the company of helping to rig the 2020 election against Trump. Trump, who lost in 2020 to Democratic President Joe Biden with whom he is due to have a rematch in the 2024 elections, falsely claimed the 2020 elections were rigged.","summary":"Lou Dobbs, a former Fox Business and CNN host who was a vocal supporter of Republican former President Donald Trump, has died at the age of 78, his friends and a statement posted on his social media account said today.","url":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2024/07/18/breaking-news/lou-dobbs-former-fox-business-and-cnn-host-dead-at-78/","image":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/web1_2024-07-18T221005Z_2021645017_RC2XX8AL4NFO_RTRMADP_3_PEOPLE-LOU-DOBBS.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-18 22:30:00","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.178},{"id":252110280,"title":"Former President Obama tells allies Biden needs to seriously consider 2024 candidacy: report","text":"CHICAGO -- President Joe Biden's political future is even more uncertain Thursday night. He's off the campaign trail following his third COVID diagnosis. And there is word that former President Barack Obama is now weighing in. It's being reported that Obama has told allies that Biden needs to seriously consider the viability of his candidacy. For now, the Biden campaign insists the president will be back on the campaign trail as soon as he can. Vice President Kamala Harris was at a rally Thursday, blasting J.D. Vance. The camera phones were up, as the spotlight continues to focus on Harris, while Biden gets more pressure to drop out. At a campaign stop in Fayetteville, North Carolina, the vice president aggressively responded to Republican vice presidential candidate J.D. Vance's speech Wednesday night at the Republican Convention. She doubted Vance's claim of unity. \"You cannot claim you stand for unity, if you are pushing an agenda that deprives whole groups of Americans of basic freedoms, opportunity and dignity,\" Harris said. Harris is doing the talking Thursday, as President Biden is recovering from COVID, at his home in Rehoboth Beach Delaware. The White House released a letter from the president's physician. Dr. Kevin O'Conner said Biden is experiencing mild symptoms. But, it's being reported former President Obama has told allies that Biden's path to victory has greatly diminished. \"I think all of this is driven by the fact that donations are drying up; polling numbers are going in the wrong direction,\" said U.S. Rep. Mike Quigley, a Democrat from Illinois' 5th District. Chicago-area Congressman Mike Quigley was one of the first in Congress to call for the president to drop out of the race. He said the president is down in the polls in over 10 swing states, which can have a big effect on down-ballot races. Quigley said, up until recently, he did not believe Biden was receiving accurate information from his staff about the polls. \"I believe that the president was cloistered. I honestly wouldn't be surprised if the campaign disregarded all the bad news and frankly misled the president,\" Quigley said. White House officials say, as soon as the president recovers, he will be back on the campaign trail. Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, who has been serving as a surrogate for Biden, will also be on the trail. \"I went to Ohio and Indiana last weekend to campaign for President Biden and Vice President Harris, and I'm going to continue to do that. He apparently is going to be our nominee,\" Pritzker said. But more top Democrats are worried a Biden loss could also mean a Republican sweep in the House and Senate. The Associated Press contributed to this report.","summary":"It's being reported former President Obama has told allies that Biden's path to victory has greatly diminished.","url":"https://abc7news.com/post/president-biden-off-campaign-trail-sick-covid-obama/15069284/","image":"https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/15069322_071824-WLS-schulte-biden-obama-4p-vid.jpg?w=1600","video":"https://vcl.abcotv.net/video/wls/071824-WLS-schulte-biden-obama-4p-vid.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-18 22:23:50","author":"Sarah Schulte,WLS","authors":["Sarah Schulte","WLS"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.382},{"id":252110512,"title":"Republicans See No Way to Lose","text":"Republicans view President Joe Biden as old, feeble, and, most importantly, beatable. Members of the GOP badly want him to remain in the race. This much was clear from my conversations with delegates on the grounds of the Republican National Convention this afternoon. Vice President Kamala Harris, should she replace Biden as the 2024 Democratic nominee, is likewise not seen by this crowd as a formidable threat to Donald Trump. “She’s not articulate. She doesn’t know America. She doesn’t know Americans,” Anthony Kirk, an Arizona delegate and a state senator, told me. “I don’t know if the country could stand four years of that laugh.” Many believed that Harris may be just as weak an opponent as Biden (a plus), and therefore didn’t want to see a brand-new ticket take shape. However, according to some delegates, if both Biden and Harris were nudged aside, that outcome would be a counterintuitive advantage for the GOP. “It’s not going to bode well for their party leadership, or the entire apparatus, for them to pass over the opportunity for a first female Black president,” Jerry DeWolf, a Maryland delegate, told me. When it comes to the other Democrats who could potentially compete in a “mini primary” before the party’s convention next month, opinions diverge. Multiple people even suggested (or trolled) that Hillary Clinton might reemerge to make this year’s election a proper 2016 rematch. More seriously, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer’s name kept coming up on a small list of politicians who might fare well in a presidential election. “With J. D. Vance attacking the ‘blue wall’—Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin—you have to counter that,” Alan Swain, a North Carolina delegate and a candidate for the state’s Second Congressional District, told me. Other delegates I spoke with mentioned Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, noting that his swing-state pull is essential for the Democrats’ survival. Ryan Campbell, an alternate Washington state delegate who grew up in Southern California, told me that California Governor Gavin Newsom looks and sounds the part of a president, but that his policies have ruined “the most beautiful state” in America. “The man is a dumpster fire, as far as policy goes,” Campbell said. No Republican I spoke with today would characterize themselves as afraid of any candidate on the Democratic bench. Most simply view the situation as a mess. Trump’s co–campaign manager Chris LaCivita, speaking with Politico’s Jonathan Martin in a live interview this morning, referred to the current Biden situation as “nothing more than an attempted coup by the Democratic Party.” Conservative Political Action Conference chair Matt Schlapp scoffed that Democrats are scheming “in a tofu-filled room.” Many RNC attendees I spoke with believe that Trump and his newly minted vice-presidential candidate, J. D. Vance, are on track for a landslide, rendering any discussion about an updated Democratic ticket moot. Nothing seems to hurt Trump’s standing in the polls in any meaningful way. Tonight, he’ll appear onstage, a white bandage on one ear, with members of the crowd wearing their own bandages in solidarity. Trump is a living martyr currently running against someone who has been derided as a dead man walking. The Biden-replacement question will continue, but, for now, Republicans are already thinking ahead to Trump’s inauguration.","summary":"Convention delegates sounded confident Trump would win, whether or not Biden stays in the race.","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/07/biden-campaign-rnc-delegates/679103/","image":"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/cMlQyovOpBtx9Tp-gVDwXMbbpPQ=/0x53:2496x1353/1200x625/media/img/mt/2024/07/DSCF0588/original.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-18 22:23:00","author":"John Hendrickson","authors":["John Hendrickson"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.244},{"id":252110108,"title":"Student Loan Forgiveness Update: What New Court Ruling Means for Payments","text":"The U.S. Department of Education said on Thursday that it will \"aggressively\" defend one of the key planks of the Biden administration's student loan forgiveness program after the 8th Circuit Court Appeals issued an order prohibiting its implementation.Some Republican led states have challenged the government's effort to forgive a number of student loans. In June, judges had ordered a stop to parts of the Biden administration's education debt forgiveness plan, known as the SAVE plan, that works to help borrowers get their loans cancelled sooner. The program allows for borrowers who took out $12,000 or less for college, to see their debt forgiven after making 10 years of payments.On Thursday, the 8th Circuit ordered a stay on the delivery of the rest of the program, Reuters reported, as legal questions around the issue are being adjudicated.\"We are assessing the impacts of this ruling and will be in touch directly with borrowers with any impacts that affect them,\" an education department spokesperson told Newsweek in a statement. \"Our Administration will continue to aggressively defend the SAVE Plan – which has been helping over 8 million borrowers access lower monthly payments, including 4.5 million borrowers who have had a zero dollar payment each month.\"They added: \"We won't stop fighting against Republican elected officials' efforts to raise costs on millions of their own constituents' student loan payments.\"The Appeals Court decision creates uncertainty for borrowers, some experts say.\"The whole plan for now has to be paused,\" Indivar Dutta-Gupta, a higher education expert, told Newsweek. \"The uncertainty is around what happens for those who are already in and of course people who are waiting to get in, but they can't. So, say you already applied, but the department of education not approved it yet. The department of education could not go and approve it. They have to wait for this to be sorted out.\"The case in question is being led by Missouri's Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey along with other other state's top law enforcement officers who have argued that the forgiveness would cost Americans hundreds of billions of dollars. On Thursday, Bailey celebrated the court's stay of the plan.\"The Court granted our emergency motion to BLOCK Joe Biden's entire illegal student loan plan, which would have saddled working Americans with half-a-trillion dollars in Ivy League debt,\" he posted on X, formerly Twitter. \"HUGE win for every American who still believes in paying their own way.\"Earlier on Thursday, the education department announced the latest move by the Biden administration to forgive student loans. An additional $1.2 billion worth of debt for 35,000 public service workers was approved for cancellation, the department said in a statement, bringing the total borrowing that has been forgiven to $169 billion for nearly 5 million borrowers. The SAVE plan alone has helped eliminate $5.5 billion worth of student loans for more than 400,000 people.","summary":"A appeals court ordered a pause on the SAVE student loan forgiveness plan.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/www-newsweek-com-student-loan-forgiveness-update-what-new-court-ruling-means-payments-1927313","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2431950/student-debt.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-18 22:22:37","author":"Omar Mohammed","authors":["Omar Mohammed"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.155}]}
