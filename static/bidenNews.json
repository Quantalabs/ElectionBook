Cunning. Not for the country. For himself. For family. He never christened some extra special anything else for anybody else. Always the No. 2 guy. Never the brains. Not really sweating. Just glad-handing. We’re talking smiling. Surviving. Taking bows. Photos. Making friends. Connections. Learning how everything operates. But for him. Accomplishing for any other guy — zilch. When it comes to him, he’s savvy. The way he operates is it’s permanently his ass he’s saving. The man always knew how to hang on. If looking for accomplishments, try Biden’s son. Or Joe’s wife’s hairdresser. Or certain business people who operate his home state of Delaware, which is smaller than my Raisin Bran box. Now, kindly pay attention: This is exactly absolutely completely why he picked Kamala for veep. Certainly not for her ability to strategize. Or speak. Or actually accomplish anything. She suited him. Helped get him elected. Not that she’d in any way helped the country. Not that she’d dredged up any creativity. She had no plan. No idea. No help. Useless. It’s just that who she was and how she got born was helpful. To him. Him. Only to Him. Help him get elected. She alone embodied the things he needed to grab the White House. So now the USA’s got her. However, few voters in the United States of America are maniacally enthusiastic about her. Yes, she’ll draw females. Also black voters, plus deluded Democrats. Plus Bernie Sanders — may his tripe decrease. Also uninvited migrants — but voters? Please! Ever hear her attempt a speech? My Yorkie — when he needs to pee — comes off better. So the Godblessus great country that we love — land of the free, home of the craven, leader of the free world — bounces downward. From Biden the nothing to Kamala the zero. I do not say she isn’t attractive. I do not say she doesn’t have supporters. I only say in the words of Marie Antoinette: “Listen, guys, I think you’re making a mistake.” I heard Kamala on TV speak a sentence like: “I can match the record of Donald Trump.” Yeah? I mean, yeah? And wouldn’t the civilized world be deeply interested in her presidential sit-down with Putin who would probably have to spend weeks studying up before he faced her? Or a one-on-one with the guy running Iran? In anticipation, North Korea’s Kim Jong Un is already quaking in his kimchi. High hopes but low appraisals. Presidential roast Midtown, Saturday night at Arno’s, stuffing myself on Italian goodies, manager Carlos Pereira seated me between teens and tweens and another table of mommas and poppas. The mommas and poppas were sticking their forks into Kamala. Since we are all created equal, it has been said, repeated and written that every one of us still has a chance to become president in the United States of America. Yeah, good, great, OK — but why now? Only in the USA, kids, Only in the USA.","summary":"Kamala Harris suited Joe Biden. Helped get him elected. Not that she’d in any way helped the country.

We’re up against a machine,” says Vivek Ramaswamy","text":"WASHINGTON, Jul 23: Republican leader Vivek Ramaswamy, who had predicted President Joe Biden would not be the Democratic presidential nominee for the November election, has said the country is not running against a candidate but an unelected managerial class machine. The Indian-American businessman-turned-politician said on Monday that the speed at which the ruling Democratic Party moved to replace incumbent President Joe Biden with Vice President Kamala Harris as a possible candidate for the November 5 polls raises lots of questions. “We’re not actually running against a candidate here. We’re running against a machine. That’s a deep understanding of what’s going on that requires rejecting some of the things you might otherwise think,” Ramaswamy said in a 15-minute long video posted on various social media platforms. During the Republican presidential debate last November, Ramaswamy, 38, had predicted that Biden would not be the Democratic presidential nominee, a claim dismissed as a ‘conspiracy theory’ by much of the mainstream media at that time. On Sunday, Biden shocked the nation by announcing that he is backing out of the presidential race and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, who, as of now, is the only Democratic Party leader in the race. “It’s not Biden that we were up against at all. His cognitive deficits, and I would argue Kamala Harris’s cognitive deficits, they’re not a bug to the people who control them. Those cognitive deficits are a feature. It is a wheel of the managerial class crushing the will of everyday citizens, not just in the Republican Party, but even in the Democratic Party,” he said. He said that the Democrats may not agree with everything that Donald Trump or the Republican Party says today, and that’s fine. No two Americans agree on 100 per cent of policies. That’s a rarity, Ramaswamy, who in January suspended his Republican presidential campaign and endorsed former president Donald Trump, said. But you do deserve a president and a party that at least tells you the truth, not just when it’s easy, but when it’s hard and when it’s uncomfortable, he said. “Beyond just this individual game, whether it’s Joe or whether it’s Kamala, we got to realise the thing that we’re actually solving for is defeating that machine, the rise of that managerial class, bigger than any other individual, it embodies the philosophy of what the modern left is really about,” he said in the video that went viral on social media. “It’s not about individual agency. It’s that collective will. That’s what this machine really is about…. That’s really what we’re running against. That’s what we’re running to defeat. That’s the system we’re running to break. That’s what the deep state is really about,” Ramaswamy said. “This is about the unelected managerial, you could call them elites, you could call them bureaucrats, you could call them monarchs, who have no accountability to the people, but whose decisions are actually most impactful on how citizens live their lives,” he said and urged the Democrats to put their best possible nominee for the elections. Ramaswamy alleged that this is a party and a movement on the Democrat side that has made it its core reason for existence to keep former president Trump out of office. “They’ve tried every way to stop him within the legal system and extra-legally as well.” But all their efforts to keep him from the ballot have not just failed but backfired making Trump and the Republican Party more popular, he added.

Eleven lawmakers, including Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly and Rep. Greg Stanton, met with President Andrés Manuel López Obrador as well as President-elect Claudia Sheinbaum for discussions that involved trade, the economy as well as border and immigration issues, according to a news release. “At a moment of change in Mexico as they prepare to inaugurate their first woman president, this visit was valuable to deepen cooperation on issues like migration, security, trade, and economic development that are critically intertwined with the United States,” Kelly said in a statement. “Mexico is one of our most important economic partners, and we see it every day in Arizona with cross-border commerce and travel along our ports of entry that we are working to upgrade. I look forward to partnering with President-elect Sheinbaum and her cabinet to address our shared challenges as we continue strengthening the historic relationship between both of our nations,” he continued. As Arizona is a border state, the relationship with Mexico places a critical role in both immigration and trade policy, whether its at the state or federal government level. The Tucson Sector is has dealt with nearly 430,000 migrant encounters on its land border with Mexico in fiscal year 2024 alone, with people coming from all over the world. The Grand Canyon State’s largest international trade partner is Mexico, with $8 billion in exports to the country as of 2023, according to the Office of the United States Trade Representative. The state and the United States’ relationship with the country could be at a turning point with the change of presidency in October for Mexico and again in the U.S. in January. As President Joe Biden will no longer seek re-election, there will be a new leader at the helm in 2025 regardless, and the influx of migrants into the country is bound to continue to be a top issue. Former President Donald Trump has previously said he would bring back the “Remain in Mexico” policy for asylum seekers awaiting legal proceedings in the United States if he is brought back to the White House, Fox News reported.","summary":"Some members of the Arizona congressional delegation visited Mexico City last week as the presidency transitions in the country.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/07/23/us-news/arizona-lawmakers-visit-mexico-amid-border-crisis-transition-to-new-president/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/000-miles-gulf-mexico-pacific-85886775.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/Ydvg05wb-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-23 23:57:25","author":"The Center Square","authors":["The Center Square"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.395},{"id":252467964,"title":"Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign raises USD 81 million in first 24 hours","text":"WASHINGTON, Jul 23 : US Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign has raised USD 81 million in the first 24-hour period since incumbent President Joe Biden stepped aside from the presidential race and endorsed his deputy as the Democratic Party’s new nominee. Biden’s decision to nominate Harris (59) follows weeks of intense pressure from fellow Democrats after his disastrous presidential debate performance against his Republican rival and former US President Donald Trump last month. Kevin Munoz, the spokesperson for Harris’ campaign, said, “There is a groundswell behind Kamala Harris and Donald Trump is terrified because he knows his divisive and unpopular agenda can’t stand up to the vice president’s record and vision for the American people.” “Team Harris raised USD 81 million in its first 24 hours, adding to the near quarter-of-a-billion dollar war chest already amassed this election cycle. This haul reflects money raised across the campaign, Democratic National Committee and joint fundraising committees,” a media release said. Over 8,88,000 grassroots donors made donations in the past 24 hours, 60 per cent of whom made their first contribution of the 2024 cycle, it said, adding, “Team Harris’ 24-hour raise is the highest 24-hour raise of any candidate in history.” “In the last 24 hours, Team Harris has added 43,000 new recurring donors, with over half of these recurring donors signing up for weekly donations. A call on Sunday evening hosted by Win with Black Women raised approximately USD 1.6 million in grassroots contributions alone. And Harris for President’s official social media, @KamalaHQ, doubled its following overnight,” the campaign said in a statement. Reacting to the support for the campaign, Munoz said, “The historic outpour of support for Vice President Harris represents exactly the kind of grassroots energy and enthusiasm that wins elections.” “Already, we are seeing a broad and diverse coalition come together to support our critical work of talking to the voters that will decide this election,” he added. Though Biden’s endorsement almost seals Harris’ position as the presidential nominee of her party, she still needs to get elected by the party’s delegates during the Democratic National Convention in Chicago from August 19-22. Biden has won 3,896 delegates as against 1,976 required to win the party’s presidential nomination. In a move that would give her access to the campaign funds, the Biden-Harris campaign amended filings with the Federal Election Commission to rename its principal committee and declare Harris a candidate for president. Following Biden’s decision, Harris, who has been serving as the US’ first female, first Black and first South Asian vice president since 2021, immediately secured the endorsement of former president Bill Clinton, thus making it a bit easier for her to win the delegate battle during the party convention. An “overwhelming majority” of state Democratic Party chairs have announced their support for Vice President Harris as their nominee for president, the Association of State Democratic Committees (ASDC) said in a statement.

Reproductive rights are likely to be a hot issue in the election season. In April, the Associated Press reported that Trump said he believed abortion limits should be left to the states, outlining his position in a video in which he declined to endorse a national ban after months of mixed messages and speculation. “Many people have asked me what my position is on abortion and abortion rights,” Trump said in the video posted on his Truth Social site. “My view is now that we have an abortion where everybody wanted it from a legal standpoint, the states will determine by vote or legislation or perhaps both. And whatever they decide must be the law of the land — in this case, the law of the state.” Trump, in the video, did not say when in pregnancy he believed abortion should be banned — declining to endorse a national cutoff that would have been used as a cudgel by Democrats ahead of the November election. Harris also rolled out some of the issues she would be committed to if elected, including addressing gun violence. “Building up the middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency,” she said as she highlighted other issues, including workers’ freedom to join a union, affordable health care, affordable child care, paid family leave, retirement with dignity, every American’s right to vote, safety from gun violence: red flag laws, and universal background checks and assault weapons bans. On Tuesday, Trump said Harris would be “easier” to beat in the November election than President Joe Biden. “She’s far more radical than he (Biden) is, so I think she should be easier than Biden because he was slightly more mainstream, but not much,” Trump said on a call with reporters. According to AFP, Trump, who is running to return to the White House, pledged to take part in at least one presidential debate with Harris. “Oh, yes, absolutely. I want to. I think it’s important,” he said on the call, adding that “I would be willing to do more than one debate, actually.” Meanwhile, Trump said on Tuesday his presumptive Democratic opponent Kamala Harris would be “easier” to beat in November’s election than President Joe Biden. “She’s far more radical than he (Biden) is, so I think she should be easier than Biden because he was slightly more mainstream, but not much,” Trump said on a call with reporters. According to AFP, Trump, who is running to return to the White House, pledged to take part in at least one presidential debate with Harris. “Oh, yes, absolutely. I want to. I think it’s important,” he said on the call, adding that “I would be willing to do more than one debate, actually.” Harris hit the US campaign trail on Tuesday after effectively clinching the Democratic presidential nomination, heading to the battleground state of Wisconsin to address citizens. The vice president took just 36 hours to secure enough delegates to be nominated, moving with lightning speed after President Joe Biden’s exit from the race triggered one of the largest election upheavals in modern US history. Top Democratic congressional chiefs – Senator Chuck Schumer and House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries – threw their weight behind her in a press conference. Hollywood star George Clooney – who made waves earlier this month as one of the first high-profile Democratic activists to urge Biden to drop his reelection bid – also said he was now behind 59-year-old Harris’s campaign to face Trump in November. Biden stunned the world by dropping his reelection bid on Sunday, bowing to weeks of pressure after a disastrous debate performance against Trump. Having made the announcement in a social media post while recovering from Covid at his Delaware beach house, Biden has yet to speak at length about his decision. AFP reports that Biden was due back at the White House Tuesday after his doctor said he was now all clear from Covid. Biden announced he would deliver a primetime speech from the Oval Office on Wednesday about “what lies ahead.”","summary":"United States Vice President, Kamala Harris, on Tuesday, vowed to put a stop to the abortion ban and help restore reproductive freedoms. “And we who believe in reproductive freedom will stop Donald Trump’s extreme abortion bans because we trust women to make decisions about their own body and not have their government tell them what \n\n\n \n Read More","url":"https://punchng.com/kamala-harris-begins-campaign-vows-to-stop-abortion-ban/","image":"https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/26194236/Kamala-Harris-e1650994956773.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-23 23:56:06","author":"Gbenga Oloniniran","authors":["Gbenga Oloniniran"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"ng","sentiment":-0.194},{"id":252468306,"title":"Rays SS Taylor Walls says gesture wasn’t meant as Trump endorsement and he likely won’t do it again","text":"TORONTO (AP) — Tampa Bay Rays shortstop Taylor Walls said Tuesday that his Donald Trump-inspired celebration of a hit Sunday was not intended as an endorsement of the Republican presidential candidate and added he was unlikely to do it again. Walls pumped his fist and shouted “Fight! Fight! Fight!” after hitting a double against the New York Yankees on Sunday, mimicking Trump’s reaction after a bullet hit his ear during a campaign event in Pennsylvania on July 13. “I think it’s pretty inspirational when any person, in the blink of an eye, their life could be taken from them,” Walls said before the Rays faced the Toronto Blue Jays. “They don’t really know what’s going on in the heat of the moment. “To immediately stand up and show strength, to me, speaks pretty loudly,” Walls added. “Anyone in that situation or that type of event, when it happens, it’s strong. It kind of represents character to me, and something that similarly I feel like I’ve faced those challenges in baseball, but on a much suppressed level.” The fifth-inning double off right-hander Marcus Stroman was Walls’ first hit since the shooting. He has five hits in 33 at-bats this month, including four singles. Still, Walls said he isn’t likely to make the gesture again. “That was kind of more of a joke that we have with guys in the locker room,” he said. “Joke may not be the right word. It was kind of just something that we had together that we thought was kind of funny, that we thought would be all right. I don’t really see that going much further than that. I don’t foresee myself doing it again.” Walls declined to say who he intended to vote for in November, referencing President Joe Biden’s recent decision not to seek reelection. The four-year veteran from Georgia said the values he was brought up with are important to him and typically inform his political choices. “You can read between the lines of how I carry myself, how I was raised, how me and my family coordinate, how we’re going to go about things and do things,” Walls said. “That’s kind of what I base my vote on and my view on.” ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb Ian Harrison, The Associated Press","summary":"TORONTO (AP) — Tampa Bay Rays shortstop Taylor Walls said Tuesday that his Donald Trump-inspired celebration of a hit Sunday was not intended as an endorsement of the Republican presidential candidate and added he was unlikely to do it again.

[+] parachute drop at San Domenico Golf Club Getty Images One of the broad topics about which I am tasked to write is leadership. With the turn of events this past weekend, I may never get an opportunity like this again. “Leaders make history,” said Karl Marx, “but not always under circumstances of their own choosing.” I hasten to offer this thought: change “not aways” to “almost never.” But when a leader stands up to circumstances of enormous proportions and makes a decision that meets these circumstances, it is then that history is written and legacies are carved and judged. These are called leadership moments. Few – very few – leaders can say they had one. Joseph R. Biden, 46th president of the United States, is one of them. His decision to extricate himself from this year’s presidential campaign – especially with so much of it in the books already, not to mention the near- and long-term future of his party and country, especially with the nomination firmly and formally in hand – bore the gravitas of an epic leadership moment, to say the very least. But it’s one thing to make a decision despite throbbing pressure and fever pitch from both sides within his Democratic party and unsurpassed vitriol and taunting from the Republicans; it’s another thing to make one of such courage, honor, and selflessness. President Biden made such a decision – and it’s one that will not have to wait for history to evaluate it. Leadership Without Ego President Biden had come off an absolutely horrible week, what with his pathetic showing in the debate followed by his Covid diagnosis. In one short week, his dreams of culminating a life of service in the way he envisioned, disintegrated before his eyes. But as heavyweight colleagues and donors continued to pile it on, the president made it clear the decision was his, and – day by day – he had not yet reached it. When it finally came, comparisons to Truman in 1952 and LBJ in 1968 turning down their parties’ nominations abounded. There was a major difference, though, as neither of them yet had a nomination they would have to give up. Joe Biden has his nomination, one that it took nearly a half century of selfless dreams and tireless work, soaring triumphs and unfathomable tragedies to earn. The nomination was his, fair and square, and all he wanted to do was continue to build on an already mighty body of accomplishments. “Ultimately, we are here for others.” But in the end, the decision to step aside was a typical Joe Biden decision: it had others in mind. Look what he did in one day with one decision: He unified the Democratic party like few of us have ever seen, bringing to mind something Will Rogers said a century ago. When asked if he was a member of an organized political party, he replied, “Organized? No, I’m a Democrat.” Today the Dems are enthusiastically and energetically united. He anointed his successor, creating a new party leader: Kamala Harris, a young vibrant standard bearer. There is no doubt or hesitation. He created a force field that swept the country and brought in a record $150 million in two days. Astounding. He reaffirmed the role of transfer of power. Like George Washington, President Biden did this willingly. By brushing aside all the personal drama, he made us turn our attention to the issues of the day, where it belongs, with only 15 weeks left until election day. He created, single-handedly, a close race, with at least one poll already showing Harris ahead. He delivered once again to the nation and the world the formula for how democracies thrive. And he may very well have shown the way to restoring civility, ethics, integrity, and mutual respect.

She had faced calls from both Democrats and Republicans to step down after a contentious House Committee hearing on Monday on the incident. The lawmakers became increasingly frustrated when she refused to answer questions about the shooting at Trump’s campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania earlier this month. In her resignation letter, Ms Cheatle said she had always “put the needs of the agency first” and it was “with a heavy heart” that she made her decision. “The scrutiny over the last week has been intense and will continue to remain as our operational tempo increases,” she said. “I do not want my calls for resignation to be a distraction from the great work each and every one of you do towards our vital mission,” she said. President Joe Biden said in a statement that he was grateful for her decades of public service. “The independent review to get to the bottom of what happened on July 13 continues, and I look forward to assessing its conclusions. We all know what happened that day can never happen again,” he said. For now, the Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas has appointed Ronald Rowe as acting director of the agency as President Biden prepares to appoint a new director soon. Rowe, a 24-year Secret Service veteran, has held the position of deputy director since April 2023. The president appointed Cheatle to head the Secret Service – which oversees the protection of current and former presidents and other officials – in 2022. She had previously served 27 years at the agency in various roles. During her time as an agent, Cheatle was involved in evacuating then Vice-President Dick Cheney from the White House during the September 11, 2001 attacks. She later went on to become supervisor of Biden’s protective detail when he was vice-president, before she became the deputy assistant director of protective operations. But her leadership came under question after the shooting at Trump’s 13th July rally, where a bullet grazed the former president’s ear. The attack left one audience member dead and two others badly wounded.","summary":"United States (US) Secret Service director Kim Cheatle has resigned after security failures surrounding an assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump. &#8220;As your director, I take full responsibility for the security lapse,&#8221; Ms Cheatle said in a resignation letter to agency staff yesterday.

Andy Ogles, R-Tenn., ‘willful refusal to uphold the immigration laws,’ stems from her alleged ‘inaction’ with border security and immigration law as ‘border czar.’ The second article of impeachment, ‘breach of public trust,’ alleges that Harris ‘knowingly misled’ the public and Congress about ‘the physical and cognitive well-being’ of Biden. Since Biden stepped down from the presidential race, Republicans have again begun to hammer Harris’ record as Biden’s ‘border czar’ – under an administration that saw record illegal border crossings. Biden appointed Harris early in his administration to deal with the ‘root causes’ of immigration. Since Biden and Harris took office, illegal immigration into the U.S. has exploded to over 8 million crossings, and is expected to reach up to 10 million by the end of September. House Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y. introduced a resolution Monday ‘condemning Kamala Harris’ role as Joe Biden’s ‘Border czar’ leading to the most catastrophic open border crisis in history.’ And calls for the 25th Amendment have swelled as Biden hit out in Delaware for 6 days with a Covid-19 diagnosis and the biggest decision of his lifetime weighing over his head. The president ultimately acquiesced to public pressure and stepped down from the running for 2024 on Sunday, nearly a month after his disastrous debate performance. Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, first filed a resolution just after the debate to call on Harris ‘to convene the Cabinet and declare President Joe Biden as unable to carry out his duties as Commander-in-Chief.’ Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters on Monday he was still considering whether to put the resolution on the House floor. Rep. Andy Ogles, R-Tenn., has called for Harris to invoke the 25th Amendment and on Tuesday introduced articles of impeachment for the vice president failing to uphold border laws. Sen. Eric Schmitt, R-Mo., wrote a letter to every one of Biden’s Cabinet members urging them to invoke the 25th Amendment. ‘If President Biden is willing to admit he is unable to continue to stand as the Democratic Party nominee for President after the primary process due to his health, he is unable to continue to serve as President until January 20, 2025,’ Schmitt said in the letters. Democrats have scoffed at the notion. ‘That’s a Jim Crow-era tactic,’ Rep. Jonathan Jackson, D-Ill., told DailyMail.com. ‘Let the American people speak. Let’s go and vote. And I think it should also talk about whether or not a person that’s been convicted as a felon has the right to go into public housing, which is the White House.’ ‘Totally stupid,’ Democratic Caucus Vice Chair Rep. Ted Lieu told DailyMail.com of the tactic. ‘[Biden] has done a phenomenal job as president, he’s going to continue doing a phenomenal job as president. The fact that he chose not to run for reelection has nothing to do with him being president right now.’ The fact that their calls will likely fall on deaf ears within the Cabinet did not deter Republicans. ‘We cannot have a Commander in Chief in charge of the nuclear codes who is experiencing the level of cognitive decline that we see in President Biden,’ said Rep. Derrick Van Orden, R-Wis., in calling for the 25th Amendment. ‘The 25th amendment looks pretty good right about now,’ Rep. Nancy Mace, R-N.C., said on X in response to a clip of Biden caught on camera for the first time in six days. ‘She lied then, and she will lie again. Joe Biden is unfit to run for President and, therefore, unfit to serve as President, yet Vice President Harris lied to the American people and covered it up. We must immediately invoke the 25th Amendment,’ wrote Rep. Claudia Tenney, R-N.Y., on X. Congress cannot invoke the 25th Amendment – the Cabinet and vice president must agree to do that. The resolution would simply turn up pressure on them to so. Still, the prospect of such a drastic step seems to have little opposition from even moderate Republicans. ‘It’s a sad situation and I feel bad for the president,’ Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., told DailyMail.com. ‘I just hope he’s able to govern. ‘I think it’s perfectly reasonable for somebody to ask if the president’s not fit to run as fit to govern,’ said Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-S.D. ‘I do think the president is much diminished from even just a couple of years ago. So I think clearly the reason we have a 25th amendment is so that those within the administration closest to the president can assess whether or not he is up to the job and I would certainly hope that assessment is ongoing.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nA Republican has filed impeachment articles against Vice President Kamala Harris over her&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Republican introduces motion to IMPEACH Kamala Harris and calls for her to use 25th Amendment to oust Biden first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/politics/republican-introduces-motion-to-impeach-kamala-harris-and-calls-for-her-to-use-25th-amendment-to-oust-biden/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/rewrite-this-title-Republican-files-articles-of-IMPEACHMENT-against-Kamala.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-23 23:32:51","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.23},{"id":252467620,"title":"US Senator Bob Menendez resigns after corruption conviction","text":"US Senator Bob Menendez submitted his resignation on Tuesday in the aftermath of his conviction on corruption charges including bribery and acting as an agent for Egypt’s government, bowing to pressure from fellow Democrats to give up the job. “I will be resigning from my office as the United States Senator from New Jersey, effective on the close of business on August 20, 2024,” Menendez’s letter, which was seen by Reuters, said. “While I fully intend to appeal the jury’s verdict, all the way and including to the Supreme Court, I do not want the Senate to be involved in a lengthy process that will detract from its important work,” the letter added. Democratic New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy will appoint a replacement for Menendez, who has represented New Jersey in the Senate since 2006 and served as chairman of the influential Foreign Relations Committee before giving up that post after being charged last year. Murphy said in a statement he had received the letter but did not provide details on when he would finalise a decision for naming Menendez’s temporary replacement. A spokesperson for Murphy did not reply to a request for details about the timing of the decision. Menendez, 70, was found guilty on July 16 by a jury in Manhattan federal court on all 16 criminal counts he faced – also including obstruction of justice, wire fraud and extortion – after a nine-week trial. Two co-defendants also were convicted. A message referring to the letter was read aloud on the Senate floor on Tuesday afternoon. The case centred on what prosecutors called bribery schemes in which the senator and his wife Nadine Menendez accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash, gold bars and car and mortgage payments from three businessmen. In exchange, Menendez steered billions of dollars in US aid to Egypt, and tried to influence the criminal prosecutions of two of the businessmen, prosecutors said. Menendez plans to appeal. US District Judge Sidney Stein has set Menendez’s sentencing for October 29, a week before the November 5 election in which he is running as an independent in a bid for another six-year term in the Senate, but is considered a long shot to win. Menendez’s resignation will temporarily reduce the Democratic majority in the Senate to 50-49 until Murphy’s appointee is sworn in to finish what remains of Menendez’s current six-year term, which ends in January. Democratic US congressman Andy Kim is running for the seat in November and is favoured to win in Democratic-leaning New Jersey. Numerous Democrats had called for Menendez to resign, including Murphy, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, and Cory Booker, New Jersey’s other senator. The trial was Menendez’s second, after a 2017 trial ended when the jury could not reach a unanimous verdict. Menendez then was censured by the Senate ethics committee for accepting gifts from a wealthy long-time friend in exchange for official favours. Menendez was first appointed to his Senate seat in 2006, after serving 13 years in the US House of Representatives. He then won election three times to the Senate. He earlier served in the New Jersey legislature and as a mayor. For decades he has been a forceful voice on American foreign relations, most recently advocating for additional aid to Ukraine and Israel as Democratic US President Joe Biden pushed Congress to allocate more money to foreign allies embroiled in conflicts. US congressman Rob Menendez, the senator’s son, continues to represent a New Jersey congressional district across the Hudson River from New York City, similar to the district his father previously represented.","summary":"The lawmaker’s departure in August will temporarily reduce the Democratic majority in the Senate to 50-49.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3271623/us-senator-bob-menendez-resigns-after-corruption-conviction","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/07/24/6d36fcc0-4bf5-4c9a-b82c-9411b61d6991_f91840e3.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-23 23:31:59","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.187},{"id":252467252,"title":"Kamala Harris’ coronation marks California Democrats’ conquest of the party — bye-bye, working class","text":"Once the euphoria of finally prying Barnacle Joe Biden off the ticket subsides, Democratic voters should be asking themselves just what their party stands for now. Many may find themselves furious. The coup apparently masterminded by Barack Obama and Nancy Pelosi may mean Kamala Harris has improved Dem chances of winning the presidency, but it also represents the completion of a fundamental change in the party. Whatever his actual policies, “Lunch Bucket Joe” always aimed to identify first and foremost with the working class — the party’s base from the days of FDR and Harry Truman. Harris, by contrast, epitomizes the hyper progressive and out-of-touch California party of George Clooney, Oprah Winfrey, their elite Hollywood dinner pals, Silicon Valley gazillionaires, government employee unions and the chattering professional class. These people are devoted to divisive “social justice,” fighting climate change at any cost, being religiously soft on crime, expanding a dependent class through welfare and ruthlessness on identity politics. Truth be told, the national party has been trending that way since at least Bill Clinton’s presidency. But now the metamorphosis seems complete. The left’s long march through America’s institutions, especially the universities, played a huge role by pushing boutique culture-war issues (“wokery”) to the top of its agenda. In reaction, the white working class began moving to the GOP at the end of the Reagan years; now Hispanic and black workers are trending that way, too. In this light, it matters a lot less that Harris is the daughter of a black man and an Indian-American woman, both immigrants, and more that they met in grad school and she grew up bourgeois. And that she rose to the Senate as a Cali politician (who’s never won a vote in her own right outside the Golden State) before Biden tapped her as VP — at Obama’s insistence, according to some reports. Harris’ appeal, like this new Democratic Party, would go down well at the French Laundry. But she’ll almost certainly struggle with a wider set of voters more interested in their pocket books, the border and public safety than trans rights or slavery reparations. And if the party’s leaders think otherwise, they’re the one who’ve “fallen from the coconut tree.”","summary":"Once the euphoria of finally prying Barnacle Joe Biden off the ticket subsides, Democratic voters should be asking themselves just what their party stands for now.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/07/23/opinion/kamala-harris-coronation-marks-california-democrats-conquest-of-the-party-bye-bye-working-class/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/2024-milwaukee-wisconsin-harris-wisconsin-85883546-e1721775636250.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-23 23:30:58","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.275},{"id":252467996,"title":"CNN's embarrassing 'Kamala is brat' segment shows why we should take Gen Z and millennial voters seriously","text":"It's 2024, and CNN still appears incapable of accurately reporting on the pop culture trends that resonate with Americans under the age of 35. Yesterday on his show The Lead with Jake Tapper, the 55-year-old anchor bungled an explanation of presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris's adoption of memes popularized by young adults online. He began by steering the conversation towards what he called the Kamala Harris campaign's \"appeal to Gen Z.\" He began, \"Singer Charli XCX tweeted last night 'Kamala IS brat.' This is in reference to her album, it's called 'Brat.'\" So far, so good. Then the first signs of trouble appear. \"Kamala has branded her Kamala HQ twitter page with the same aesthetic of the album,\" he says, adding \"It's another Gen Z word, aesthetic.\" Unfortunately, \"aesthetic\" is not a Gen Z word but, simply, a word. Then, for more information on this \"Gen Z\" phenomenon, Tapper turns to 69-year-old special correspondent Jamie Gangel. By her own admission, Gangel is not the right person for the job. And yet she stumbles on, noting \"First of all — just for my producer, Elizabeth Stuart, who will spit out her coffee as I say this — I am supposed to say 'That's brat.'\" She adds with knowing sarcasm \"And, for those who are not in the know the way I am, [brat] is a cool thing.\" As Gangel continues, she holds up a physical print out of the Kamala HQ Twitter page. \"It has a color — chartreuse is the color — and Kamala Harris has adopted that for whatever social media page that is.\" She says the last bit while looking at the piece of paper and shaking her head. Then Gangel puts on her reading glasses to recite a quote off her phone that is written in a font so large and bold that it is legible on camera during an over-the-shoulder shot. It's Charli XCX's definition of a brat: \"You're just that girl who is a little messy, and likes to party, and maybe says some dumb things some times.\" Tapper, as expected, is confused. \"Is the idea that we're all kind of brat?\" he asks the table. \"And Vice President Harris is brat?\" It is at this moment that 32-year-old Kaitlan Collins, the youngest person in the room, is finally able to chime in with the facts. \"I don't now if you're brat,\" she tells Tapper (and she is right). \"You aspire to be brat, you don't just become brat. You have to try.\" Collins articulates the essence of brat-core: it's just something you are, an enviable intangible. As a compliment, it invokes the same je ne sais quoi as the it-girl, though a brat may have an even more unapologetic or provocative approach to life. Despite this, Tapper dismisses Collins. \"The point is that [Harris], or some very clever people that work for her, is going right for [Gen Z] in a language of their own that apparently no one at this table speaks.\" When Kaitlin throws up a hand in protest, Tapper says flippantly \"Except for you because you think you're 23. You're a millennial, take it easy.\" The irony is that, while much of Charli XCX's \"brat\" culture is popular amongst Gen Z, it is crafted in large part by millennial women and gay men. Charli XCX, at 31-years-old, is a millennial herself, and has been making music for her peers since 2013. It's really easy to brush off CNN's brief, clownish coverage of America's political youth culture as a silly bit. But the reality is that Gen Z could be kingmakers in this election. NBC exit polls from the 2020 election suggested that 65 percent of those between the ages of 18 and 24 — an age group almost entirely made of Gen Zers — voted for President Joe Biden. That was 11 percent more than any other age group. Since then, the support of Gen Z and millennial voters had become consistently elusive to the President. Now, with millennial Republican Vice President nominee J.D. Vance in the mix, that constituency may be more in play than ever before. And Kamala Harris may be able to win these voters back by speaking to them — as Tapper put it — in their language. Engaging with a hugely popular and relatively harmless meme is an easy first step to revitalizing a youth voter base that has been underwhelmed by Biden. CNN could take a page from her book by bringing on journalists who understand and respect the constituents they're reporting on. Because while gray-haired pundits on CNN may not understand how to connect with millennial and Gen Z voters, the Harris campaign certainly does. And it may be what wins them the election.","summary":"CNN's analysis of the Kamala Harris campaign's \"brat\"-themed rebrand underscores the power of Gen Z in the upcoming election.","url":"https://mashable.com/article/kamala-brat-cnn-explainer","image":"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/02OsorRLfoz5r7NSVf97ZdC/hero-image.fill.size_1200x675.v1721776146.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-23 23:24:46","author":"Elizabeth de Luna","authors":["Elizabeth de Luna"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.331},{"id":252467472,"title":"Here's Why Many Accused Michelle Obama of Being 'Jealous' of Melania Trump","text":"A TikTok user once stirred up controversy by claiming Michelle Obama and other former first ladies are \"jealous\" of Melania Trump. This accusation came in the wake of Rosalynn Carter's funeral, where Trump stood out in a light gray coat among a sea of black attire. The memorial service, held in Atlanta on November 28, brought together high-profile mourners. Former President Jimmy Carter joined President Joe Biden, former President Bill Clinton, and past first ladies in the front row. As photos from the event circulated online, Trump's outfit choice sparked discussion. TikTok user @republicanlatina03 shared her thoughts in a video. She declared, \"[They're] just jealous of Melania Trump and this just proves that the jealousy continues.\" The user showed a photo of Trump walking ahead of Obama and Laura Bush. She added, \"That's why they hate her, because they can't be her. You hate what you cannot be. Melania Trump... is beautiful as always, super gorgeous.\" The TikTok user also pointed out a photo where sunlight fell on Trump. She claimed, \"From all the darkness in the room, the only one who had that light was Melania Trump.\" She interpreted this as a sign, saying \"light is the truth and it's a hope.\" These comments sparked debate online. Some agreed, while others highlighted the achievements of the other first ladies. TikTok user @mrsjean01 countered the claims. She said, \"Michelle Obama? Michelle Obama is probably the most decorated first lady ever... She is the forever first lady and you think that she is jealous of Melania?\" @mrsjean01 emphasized Michelle Obama's education. \"Michelle Obama graduated from Harvard Law School. She got her PhD. She got her doctorate,\" she stated. In contrast, she asked, \"What Melania Trump got? Not a damn thing!\" The TikTok user also criticized Melania's choice of attire for the funeral. \"No, she's the idiot—the only person in there that didn't wear black that is clearly supposed to be worn, is the preferred color when you're going to a... funeral,\" she said. This isn't the first time Trump has faced controversy. In 2016, she was accused of plagiarizing parts of Obama's 2008 speech at the Republican National Convention. A Trump campaign staff writer later took responsibility for the mistake. Fox News host Jesse Watters attempted to defend Melania's outfit choice. He showed photos of other first ladies wearing non-black attire at past funerals. However, it's worth noting that in those cases, the women wore black underneath their coats, as per Newsweek. Interestingly, Obama has spoken about her relationship with Trump in the past. In her memoir Becoming, Obama wrote that she offered help to Trump, just as Bush had done for her. When asked if Trump had reached out, Obama simply replied, \"No, she hasn't.\" Trump's team responded to this. Her communications director, Stephanie Grisham, stated, \"Mrs. Trump is a strong and independent woman who has been navigating her role as First Lady in her own way. When she needs advice on any issue, she seeks it from her professional team within the White House,\" as per CNN. The two women have met in person only three times since the 2016 election. These encounters include a tea invitation at the White House, Inauguration Day, and Barbara Bush's memorial service.","summary":"This accusation came in the wake of Carter&#39;s funeral, where Trump stood out in a gray coat among a sea of black attire.

Harris has enlisted the law firm of Eric Holder, the former attorney general, to vet possible running mates, sources told Reuters. These are some of the top people being discussed, according to people familiar with internal policy discussions. ANDY BESHEAR, GOVERNOR, KENTUCKY Kentucky’s Democratic governor, Andy Beshear, has carved a successful political career in a heavily Republican state that voted for Republican Donald Trump by a margin of more than 25 percentage points in 2020. Beshear has touted his record of bringing jobs to Kentucky, supporting public education and expanding health care access. As governor, he has vetoed legislation banning abortions and gender-affirming care for transgender youth, although the vetoes were overridden by the Republican-dominated legislature. Beshear endorsed Harris on Monday, saying she could help the country “move on to something better” for America. Asked if he would consider the vice presidency, he told MSNBC that he loved serving his state but added: “The only way I would consider something other than this current job is if I believed I could further help my people and to help this country.” PETE BUTTIGIEG, U.S. SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION U.S. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg built a strong fan base among Democratic Party voters during his 2020 primary run against both Biden and Harris, winning the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucus. Seen as a polished defender of Biden policies, Buttigieg later endorsed Biden and was picked to join the incoming administration’s Cabinet in 2021. The former South Bend, Indiana, mayor also has ties in Michigan, a critical state for Democrats in November. On Sunday, Buttigieg backed Harris’ candidacy, saying “Harris is now the right person to take up the torch, defeat Donald Trump and succeed Joe Biden … I will do all that I can to help her win.” ROY COOPER, GOVERNOR, NORTH CAROLINA North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper has won praise from Democrats for his strong focus on economic development and his ability to win relatively strong approval ratings in a politically competitive state that leans Republican and voted for Republican candidate Donald Trump in both 2016 and 2020. “If you want a nominee who can put Donald Trump’s destruction of Roe at center stage, if you want a nominee who actually prosecuted criminals like Donald Trump, and if you want a nominee who can put Trump’s age and fitness in the forefront, Kamala Harris is the person,” Cooper told MSNBC on Monday, one day after speaking with Harris and announcing his endorsement. MARK KELLY, U.S. SENATOR, ARIZONA U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly is liked among Democratic Party elites for striking a relatively moderate tone in a hotly contested state that traditionally has favored Republicans, but which Biden won in 2020. A former U.S. Navy captain and astronaut, Kelly is also the husband of former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who was seriously wounded in a 2011 shooting. Gun violence is a major campaign issue for Democrats. “I couldn’t be more confident that Vice President @KamalaHarris is the right person to defeat Donald Trump and lead our country into the future. She has my support for the nomination, and Gabby and I will do everything we can to elect her President of the United States,” Kelly wrote in an X post on Sunday, referring to his wife. JOSH SHAPIRO, GOVERNOR, PENNSYLVANIA Josh Shapiro, Pennsylvania’s governor, took office just last year but is already seen as a rising star for the party nationally. Trained as a lawyer, Shapiro served as the state’s attorney general, a legal background that is similar to Harris’ own as a prosecutor. He has a long history of winning elections against Republicans in a state that Democrats believe they must win to secure the election in November. Shapiro and Harris spoke on Sunday, according to a source familiar with the matter. “I’ve known Kamala Harris for nearly two decades — we’ve both been prosecutors, we’ve both stood up for the rule of law, we’ve both fought for the people and delivered results. Kamala Harris is a patriot worthy of our support,” he said in a statement on Sunday, adding that she would “perfect our union, protect democracy and advance real freedom.” J.B. PRITZKER, GOVERNOR, ILLINOIS Billionaire Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker has proven a major force in the party, tapping his own financial resources linked to Hyatt Hotels to help Biden’s campaign effort and to stand up the Democratic National Convention in Chicago next month. While Illinois leans heavily Democratic, neighboring Wisconsin is one of the biggest prizes in the 2024 election. Endorsing Harris on Monday, Pritzker said the two had spoken and that he felt it was important for the U.S. to elect a woman as president. “Harris has proven, at every point in her career, that she possesses the skills, strength, and character to lead this country and the vision to better the lives of all Americans… she represents our party’s best chance to defeat Donald Trump,” he said. TIM WALZ, GOVERNOR, MINNESOTA Minnesota’s Democratic governor, Tim Walz, also would bring to the presidential ticket a record of defeating Republicans in a Midwestern state. A veteran of the U.S. Army National Guard, Walz previously represented a vast, rural and Republican-leaning district that borders the competitive state of Wisconsin in Congress. “Thanks for the call, @KamalaHarris,” he said on social media on Monday. “You have my full support.” GRETCHEN WHITMER, GOVERNOR, MICHIGAN Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has built a strong base in the closely contested state of Michigan, running on a platform of straight talk and kitchen-table issues. She attracted Biden’s attention in 2020, being vetted as a possible running mate before Biden picked Harris. She was a top supporter of and spokesperson for Biden’s reelection bid. A Harris-Whitmer ticket would be the first all-woman ticket for a major U.S. political party — a potential bonus in an election where women’s reproductive rights are a top issue, if such a pairing could surmount any sexism. Whitmer endorsed Harris in a post on X on Monday and said she will serve as co-chair of Harris’ campaign. She told CBS affiliate WLNS that she would not take the vice presidential post if offered it, saying “I am not leaving Michigan.” Harris will focus on lowering costs for Michigan voters, “restoring their freedoms, bringing jobs and supply chains back home from overseas, and building an economy that works for working people,” Whitmer said in a separate statement. “We cannot let Donald Trump anywhere near the White House.

The 42-year-old has been described as the party's \"best communicator\" and his age has been discussed as a potential asset to counter the 39-year-old Republican vice-presidential candidate, JD Vance. During the 2020 presidential race, Mr Buttigieg helped Harris prepare for vice-presidential debates by playing her Republican rival, Mike Pence. He is the first openly gay person to serve in a US president's cabinet. Roy Cooper Age: 67 Current position: Governor of North Carolina Mr Cooper is currently serving his second term as North Carolina governor, having previously served as attorney-general for 16 years. He is known for appointing the most diverse cabinet in North Carolina history and for vetoing several anti-abortion bills in his state. The 67-year-old and Ms Harris have known each other for 12 years, since they both served as attorneys-general in their respective states. Mark Kelly Age: 60 Current position: Senator for Arizona As a former astronaut and navy veteran, Mr Kelly has one of the most interesting backgrounds of those in the race to be Ms Harris's running mate. He was first elected to the US Senate in a 2020 special election and was later re-elected to a full term in 2022. Mr Kelly has built a high profile as a gun-control advocate alongside his wife, former representative Gabby Giffords, who survived an assassination attempt in 2011. While he usually toes the party line, Mr Kelly has previously broken rank to describe the entry of undocumented migrants across the southern border as a \"crisis\". Wes Moore Age: 45 Current position: Governor of Maryland Mr Moore is Maryland’s first African American governor and is considered a rising star of the Democratic Party. The former Rhodes scholar has served in the US Army, worked as an investment banker and published five books. The governor's name may be familiar from headlines earlier this year when a cargo ship crashed into the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Maryland, killing six. He has told media he is content being Maryland's governor and wouldn't want the VP job. Gavin Newsom Age: 56 Current position: Governor of California He's been the Californian governor since 2019 and has previously served as mayor of San Francisco. Mr Newsom has built a name for himself in recent years by taking on prominent Republican politicians, including in a debate against Ron DeSantis last year. A potential Harris-Newsom ticket could be difficult, though. The pair both hail from California, which brings up a hurdle under the 12th amendment, which requires electors to \"vote by ballot for President and Vice-President, one of whom, at least, shall not be an inhabitant of the state with themselves\". Essentially, a Harris-Newsom ticket would have to forgo all of California's 54 electoral college votes. JB Pritzker Age: 59 Current position: Governor of Illinois One of Mr Pritzker's major strengths is his ability to fund his own campaign due to being a member of the wealthy family that founded the Hyatt hotel chain. He is currently serving his second term as Illinois governor and had previously been active in Democratic fundraising circles. Mr Pritzker's non-profit organisation, Think Big America, has funded abortion rights efforts across the US. The governor has become known as a bit of a bulldog for the Democrats for his attacks on Donald Trump. He has fuelled speculation about his political future on social media by replying to a suggestion he \"would be running for something\" with: \"You think I just fell out of a coconut tree?\" That's a reference to a viral clip of Harris. Josh Shapiro Age: 51 Current position: Governor of Pennsylvania Mr Shapiro has been the popular first-term governor of Pennsylvania since 2023. Prior to that, he served as the state's attorney-general for two terms, from 2016 to 2022. During that time, he drew national interest for his investigation into sexual abuse in the Catholic Church and successfully fighting Trump's voter fraud claims in the 2020 election. He has been vocal about protecting abortion access in Pennsylvania after the overturning of Roe v Wade. Mr Shapiro, who is Jewish, has aggressively confronted what he has viewed as anti-Semitism cropping up from pro-Palestinian demonstrations, and he has professed solidarity with Israel in its drive to eliminate Hamas. Gretchen Whitmer Age: 52 Current position: Governor of Michigan Ms Whitmer's name has been bandied about a fair bit in recent weeks, with political commentators first suggesting she was in contention for the party’s presidential nomination. As the governor of a must-win state for Democrats, Ms Whitmer has been one of the Biden campaign's most prominent politicians. With Ms Harris's name likely to be at the top of the ticket, discussions have turned to whether Ms Whitmer could receive the vice-presidential nomination. Former New York mayor Bill de Blasio has suggested on social media a Harris-Whitmer match-up is \"a team we can win with\". But Ms Whitmer has shot down these suggestions, telling media she's \"not going anywhere\" when asked whether she if she's prepared to take the vice-presidency if it is offered.","summary":"With Kamala Harris the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, the biggest question looming for the party is who could be her running mate.

Will her viral moment serve her? First, here are four new stories from The Atlantic: A Fine Line On Sunday, some of the most notable people in the world were posting some of the most consequential statements of modern American history on social media. But there was one post from a lesser-known figure that none of the frenzied political reporting of recent weeks prepared me for: “kamala IS brat,” the pop singer Charli XCX declared. With three words, XCX, a pop diva of the summer, validated the likely Democratic presidential nominee (to be clear, being “brat”—the title and central concept of her latest album—is a good thing). The internet, to paraphrase another XCX lyric, went crazy. Fans of XCX, who has dominated dance-music charts and captured a young and very online corner of the internet this summer, shared a slew of video edits of Harris with XCX’s songs in the background. Harris’s own rapid-response account on X quickly updated its banner image to “kamala hq” in the font and color scheme of Brat. Sunday was a banner day for Harris online (and, you know, in real life). The internet was ready for her: Over the past month, a steady stream of clips and memes of her zaniest moments, including her widely shared quote from her mother, “You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?,” have been getting traction. Harris has long had an energetic online fan base—the so-called #KHive rallied behind her in 2020—but she herself does not often post beyond standard politician fare. That may be part of why the flickers of engagement from her campaign’s account over the past few days—and the clips positioning the candidate as a fun pop-cultural figure—have delighted her fans so. The posts are fun, but they may not hold much value for Harris beyond that. Harris’s team should “keep in mind that the ‘extremely online’ population doesn’t necessarily represent the demographics or worldview of the rest of the country,” Caitlin Chin-Rothmann, a fellow focused on technology at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told me in an email. For all the people excited about the recent memes, many are baffled at, or simply uninterested in, the Brat and coconut-tree discourse. (XCX, although beloved by her fans, is also more of a niche cultural figure than a mainstream pop star.) If Harris indeed becomes the Democratic nominee, she will want, to state the obvious, to earn as many votes as possible. Getting the age group likeliest to be on TikTok and listen to XCX to vote for her could only help. “The youth vote is not large—they’re one of the lowest-turnout groups in the country—but they’ve leaned strongly Democratic in recent cycles,” Seth Masket, the director of the Center on American Politics at the University of Denver, said in an email. “It’s likely Biden wouldn’t have won in 2020 without their strong support. Engaging them seems particularly important, if not by itself sufficient.” Still, equating online activity with voting trends is a dangerous game: “Social media is mostly a reflection, not a cause, of political behavior,” Dean Lacy, a government professor at Dartmouth, noted to me via email. Research has not borne out a link between social-media traction and the results of an election, he added. It’s too early to see how Harris would play among young people on Election Day, and the picture based on the polling thus far is mixed. (Much of that polling was conducted before she became the likely nominee, so the findings may yet shift as her presence in the race turns from a hypothetical to a real possibility.) CNN polling conducted late last month found that although slightly more people aged 18–34 supported Harris than Donald Trump, she lagged behind other Democrats who saw more support in recent elections. So what is a buzzy online moment worth? Normally, Masket said, he wouldn’t see a huge advantage from this type of online flurry. But young people seemed “incredibly unenthusiastic” about Joe Biden as the nominee, so targeting Gen Z with memes and cultural references may help engage them. And Harris’s campaign doesn’t have much time to spare in bringing aboard the undecided among those voters. The line between participating in an online joke and being cringe is a thin one. Harris is teetering on that line right now—and so far, she’s on the right side of it. It helps that most of the posts and memes are coming from her fans, not from her or her campaign. But the positive online energy could quickly curdle, my colleague Charlie Warzel reminded me, if voters perceive a gap between how Harris acts and how she posts. “If she runs a very staid, normal political campaign, then I think it will feel very inauthentic and cringey if her staff tries to make her seem Extremely Online,” he said. The value of these memes, for Harris, is in what they prove about her candidacy. After months of controlling Biden’s public appearances, the Democrats now have a candidate they can proudly draw attention toward. Harris, as Charlie told me, can “take some of the oxygen away from the Trump campaign. That ability is more of an asset than any set of memes.” Related: Stephanie Bai contributed research.

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., says he’s not ready to join them just yet. Sanders said Tuesday evening that he hopes Harris will defeat Donald Trump in November, telling reporters: “I’m gonna do everything I can to make sure that she becomes president” — but with a caveat that he needs to see more from her. Sanders stopped short of an endorsement, saying that Harris needs to outline a specific plan to help working-class Americans before he will formally back her campaign. “I look forward to strongly supporting her. But I think if she is going to win, she’s going to have to focus a great deal of attention on the plight of the American working class, come up with some very specific suggestions as to how she’s going to address the reality that 60% of our people are living paycheck to paycheck,” Sanders said, though he did not outline what specifics he hopes to see from the vice president. Harris has “to make it clear that she’s on the side of the working class of this country. If she does that, she’s going to win and I think she can win big.” Asked whether Harris’ choice of a running mate will be important to his endorsement, Sanders said, “Yes, it is.” Sanders had demanded similar commitments of President Joe Biden before supporting him in the past. The Vermont senator has tended to seize opportunities to elevate his key issues, like expanding Social Security and raising the minimum wage. In fact, Sanders had publicly backed Biden up until the moment he dropped out of the 2024 race, saying the president still had a path to victory if he supported expanded Medicare benefits, a bigger child tax credit and tax hikes on the wealthy to preserve Social Security. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., a fellow progressive, had also backed Biden until the end of his campaign as she pressed him to embrace a bolder agenda. But she endorsed Harris hours after Biden exited the race on Sunday. “Now more than ever, it is crucial that our party and country swiftly unite to defeat Donald Trump and the threat to American democracy,” Ocasio-Cortez said on X. Forty-eight Democratic senators have endorsed Harris, along with 175 House members, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, both of New York. A majority of pledged delegates to the Democratic convention have also endorsed Harris ahead of an early August vote to make her the party’s nominee for president.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nWASHINGTON — Dozens of Democrats across the party&#8217;s political spectrum quickly endorsed&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Senator Bernie Sanders pledges dedicated effort to support Harris&#8217; election, stops short of endorsing her at present first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/senator-bernie-sanders-pledges-dedicated-effort-to-support-harris-election-stops-short-of-endorsing-her-at-present/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/rewrite-this-title-Sen-Bernie-Sanders-says-hell-work-hard.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-23 23:03:12","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.17},{"id":252467470,"title":"Fox News Host Claims That Biden Didn’t Actually Sign Letter of Exit From Race, “There Was No Video”","text":"President Joe Biden, after weeks of assuring donors, party members, and voters alike, that he was not stepping down from the ticket after his catastrophic debate performance, decided otherwise. Recuperating from COVID-19 in his Delaware beach home, he ended his re-election bid on Sunday through a letter to America. While the response was mixed, Fox & Friends co-host Lawrence Jones, opined that it was hard to believe anything was done in good faith. As reported by Mediate, Jones suggested a conspiracy theory that Biden wasn't involved in the drafting of the letter. He alleged, \"He clearly didn't write\" it and argued \"there was no video of the moment.\" Additionally, Jones saw parallels between Biden and Senator Dianne Feinstein, who was in office until her death last year. Jones said, \"Obviously, you know, I wish the president well. I want his health to be in order. I think that should be the main priority of the country right now, making sure that he gets the help that he needs. But again, we still have not seen Joe Biden. There was no video. There was no photo of the moment. All we got is a statement that he clearly didn’t write.\" He explained, \"This reminds me of the moment when Dianne Feinstein was going down and she was ill. Everybody knew that she was ill. And the staff put out a statement about her retirement. And so all the Capitol Hill reporters started questioning to go, you know, 'Madam Senator, you know, you just put out the statement' as she retired and she goes, 'What statement?' She didn’t know the statement at the time because obviously, she was ill at the time.\" To verify that the commander-in-chief was the true signatory of the letter, he demanded a news conference or video from the president. Jones isn't alone in wondering where Biden is and why he hasn't made any public appearances since Sunday, when he abruptly left the presidential race. The incumbent remains confined at his Rehoboth property since being diagnosed with COVID-19. Meanwhile, in her first public appearance since accepting Biden's endorsement to be the 2024 Democratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris made a statement at the White House explaining that POTUS was still recovering from the virus. As reported by The New York Post, Harris clarified, \"Our president, Joe Biden, wanted to be here today. He is feeling much better and recovering fast, and he looks forward to getting back on the road. In one term, he has already surpassed the legacy of most presidents who have served two terms in office.\" At the end of her speech, she expressed her gratitude for Biden's service to the country and lauded his struggle for the American People.","summary":"Given POTUS has not made any public appearance since announing his exit, the presenter claimed he wasn&#39;t involved in the drafting of the letter.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/fox-news-host-claims-that-biden-didnt-actually-sign-letter-of-exit-from-race-there-was-no-video","image":"https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/706632/uploads/0e5b2430-48d6-11ef-9d4f-51593840102d_1200_630.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-23 23:02:01","author":"INQUISITR,Priyanka Pandey","authors":["INQUISITR","Priyanka Pandey"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.259},{"id":252466422,"title":"Biden heads to Washington after COVID, ending campaign","text":"WILMINGTON, Delaware >> President Joe Biden headed to Washington on Tuesday, two days after ending his re-election bid and endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris for the Democratic nomination to take on Republican former President Donald Trump.

Trump’s complaint with the Federal Election Commission on Tuesday accuses the president and vice president of running afoul of campaign finance laws by turning Biden’s now-ended campaign into the “Harris for President” campaign, allowing Harris to tap into more than $91 million in the campaign’s coffers. After Biden ended his re-election campaign on Sunday, Biden notified the FEC that his committee was changing its name to Harris for President, with Harris as the beneficiary. But as Biden’s running mate, Harris was already sharing the campaign committee with the president, and legal analysts have doubted the arguments at the heart of Trump’s attempt to take the wind out of his rival’s sails. The Trump campaign’s legal team is now accusing Harris of “seeking to perpetrate a $91.5 million dollar heist of Joe Biden’s leftover campaign cash — a brazen money grab that would constitute the single largest excessive contribution and biggest violation in the history of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, as amended,” according to the complaint, which has been reviewed by The Independent. “This is little more than a thinly veiled $91.5 million excessive contribution from one presidential candidate to another, that is, from Joe Biden’s old campaign to Kamala Harris’s new campaign,” reads the complaint, written by Trump campaign general counsel David Worrington. “This effort makes a mockery of our campaign finance laws,” he added. The complaint was first reported by The New York Times. “Team Harris will continue to build on our more than 250 coordinated offices and more than 1,300 coordinated staffers across the battleground states — just like we built on the $240 million cash on hand that we had at launch this week, raising $100 million in our first 36 hours and signing up 58,000 volunteers,” Harris campaign spokesperson Charles Kretchmer Lutvak said in a statement to The Independent. “Republicans may be jealous that Democrats are energized to defeat Donald Trump and his MAGA allies, but baseless legal claims — like the ones they’ve made for years to try to suppress votes and steal elections — will only distract them while we sign up volunteers, talk to voters, and win this election,” he added. Campaign finance analysts have doubted the legal theory propelling Trump-allied challenges to Harris’s campaign. The committees that have raised funds for Biden’s re-election — Biden for President, Biden Victory Fund and Biden Action Fund — all have included Harris. The committees remain the same, just with different names. But right-wing legal groups have been eager to slow down any Democratic momentum now that Biden is no longer in the race. “Because Biden and Harris share a campaign committee, the Vice President and her running mate can continue using the campaign’s existing funds for the general election if she is on the Democratic ticket as either the presidential or vice-presidential nominee,” according to Trevor Potter, president of Campaign Legal Center. Among the arguments in the complaint, Trump’s counsel argues Harris is not in a position to inherit contributions because she is not yet officially the Democratic Party’s nominee, and that the campaign’s treasurer “attempted fraud” by using government documents to “rename and repurpose” Biden’s committee. Moments after Biden announced he was ending his re-election campaign, Trump-appointed FEC chair Sean Cooksey posted an excerpt of campaign finance law that requires contributions to a candidate for the general election be refunded or redesignated if that candidate doesn’t run. A group of House Democrats sent him a letter on Tuesday to clarify campaign finance law, warning that his statements could risk fueling “uncertainty and mistrust” in the nation’s campaign finance system and “our democracy more generally.” “All I did was quote federal regulations,” he wrote in response on X. “Why are Democrats afraid of the law?”","summary":"Trump’s FEC complaint accuses Harris of committing a ‘brazen money grab’ after Biden dropped out of the race","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-fec-complaint-biden-harris-b2584772.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/07/23/23/2162572795.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/TskseQan-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-23 22:58:41","author":"Alex Woodward","authors":["Alex Woodward"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.006},{"id":252465916,"title":"Democrats Snub Netanyahu Address as Trump to Welcome Him to Mar-a-Lago","text":"Following Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's arrival in Washington, D.C., more Democrats are deciding to skip his expected speech Wednesday, as former President Donald Trump gears up to welcome the Israeli leader.During his trip, Netanyahu is anticipated to deliver an address to Congress on Wednesday and meet with President Joe Biden Thursday, according to a report from the Associated Press (AP), which added that the Israeli leader will hold separate talks with Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday.Trump announced on Truth Social that Netanyahu will also make a stop at Mar-a-Lago on Friday.\"Looking forward to welcoming Bibi Netanyahu at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida … During my first term, we had Peace and Stability in the Region, even signing the historic Abraham Accords—And we will have it again,\" Trump wrote on his Truth Social.Netanyahu's visit arrives more than nine months into Israel's war against Hamas, which began after Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, killing 1,200 people and taking approximately 250 people hostage, per the Israeli government. About 120 remain held and around a third are believed to be dead, according to Israeli authorities.Israel subsequently launched its heaviest-ever airstrikes in Gaza. More than 39,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, per AP. The rising death toll has led to international calls for a ceasefire, and heavy division over the conflict remains in the U.S.Since it was announced Netanyahu would give an address, several Democratic lawmakers have said they will not attend, citing the war.In a statement released on Tuesday, representative Mark Takano of California became the latest Democratic lawmaker to announce he's skipping the speech.Newsweek has reached out to the White House via email for comment Tuesday.\"For weeks I have wrestled with whether or not to attend Prime Minister Netanyahu's joint address before Congress. In recent months, I've grown increasingly troubled by Mr. Netanyahu's actions, which have sought to further his own political survival rather than securing the return of hostages and a much-needed ceasefire. As someone who cares deeply about Israel, I recognize that any path towards a permanent peace must begin with a bilateral ceasefire. Mr. Netanyahu has consistently demonstrated that he is an obstacle to the peace that both Israelis and Palestinians alike deserve,\" Takano said in a news release.This follows Senate Pro Tempore Patty Murray, who was expected to sit behind Netanyahu at the address, declining to attend the speech, along with Representatives Greg Casar, Jim Clyburn, Lloyd Doggett, Pramila Jayapal, Hank Johnson, Stephen Lynch and Jan Schakowsky.In June, AP reported that interviews with more than a dozen Democrats revealed the discontent over Netanyahu's address, and how some feel it is a Republican ploy to divide Democrats.\"It is apparent Republican leadership have given this platform to the Prime Minister in order to sow division amongst Members of Congress during this precarious time. Rather than engage in political games, I plan to meet with Israeli citizens during the morning of the address to support families that have suffered in the wake of the October 7th attack,\" Takano added on Tuesday.GOP House Speaker Mike Johnson, who helped facilitate Netanyahu's address, is expected to highlight Republican support for the Israeli leader.During the visit, Biden is expected to focus his talk with Netanyahu on negotiating a hostage release and ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, which Jake Sullivan, national security adviser, indicated at a security conference in Colorado last week.According to AP, Biden expressed optimism of a deal as he spoke to campaign staffers on Monday: \"I think we're on the verge\" of ending the war.The outlet also reported that before he departed Israel for the U.S., Netanyahu pointed toward his intent to discuss continuing the conflict with Hamas and confront other Iran-backed groups, along with addressing the release of hostages.Protests are also planned, according to AP, as the demonstrations outside the Capitol are expected to include demonstrators condemning the Israeli military campaign as well as others expressing support for Israel. The largest protest could see at least 5,000 people and is set for Wednesday morning, with organizers planning to march and demand Netanyahu's arrest on war crime charges.","summary":"Division remains in the U.S. as more Democrats are deciding to skip Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's expected speech.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/democrats-snub-netanyahu-address-trump-welcome-him-mar-lago-1929352","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2435170/benjamin-netanyahu.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-23 22:56:43","author":"Natalie Venegas","authors":["Natalie Venegas"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.056},{"id":252465876,"title":"House GOP Leaders to Members: Please Stop Talking About Kamala Harris’ Race","text":"Leaders of the House Republican caucus scolded members on Tuesday after several representatives went off-script to attack Vice President Kamala Harris on the basis of her race and gender, according to multiple reports.

A number of congresspeople have made similar attacks in recent days, including many during televised interviews. Rep. Glenn Grothman (R-WI) caught flak on Sunday for saying “a lot of Democrats feel they have to stick with her because of her ethnic background.” Rep. Harriet Hageman (R-WY) also said during an interview that Harris is “intellectually, just really kind of the bottom of the barrel,” adding that she thinks the vice president “was a DEI hire.” Rep. Tim Burchett (R-TN) also made a similar comment on Monday, telling CNN political reporter Manu Raju that Harris was a “DEI vice president”—and that President Joe Biden had “skipped over” others when he selected her as his running mate. “What about white females? What about any other group?” he added. During a press conference on Tuesday, Raju pressed Johnson on what he thought of Burchett’s comments. “This is not personal with regard to Kamala Harris and her ethnicity or her gender have nothing to do with this whatsoever,” he replied.","summary":"Jack Gruber/USA Today via ReutersLeaders of the House Republican caucus scolded members on Tuesday after several representatives went off-script to attack Vice President Kamala Harris on the basis of her race and gender, according to multiple reports.\n\nRep.

She “has popularity issues of her own,” as her approval rating has always been under the 50% mark. Add “a concerning electoral track record,” running far behind other California Democrats as she won the state attorney general job in 2010 while “her presidential campaign was perhaps an even bigger disappointment.” And she needs to “distance herself” from Biden’s failures, “come into her own as a candidate” and “develop a campaign pitch” appealing to swing-state voters in the “swing states who will decide this election.” Definitely “an uphill fight.” Pollsters: A Major GOP Convention Bounce Their post-Republican-convention poll shows that “among likely voters, Trump’s personal favorability (49 percent) is 7 points ahead of Vice President Kamala Harris,” report Douglas E. Schoen & Carly Cooperman at The Hill. Overall: “The convention and Trump’s speech, which a majority (55 percent) of likely voters felt was ‘excellent’ or ‘good,’ was worth between 3-4 points for Trump.” More: “A strong majority (61 percent) of likely voters say that the Republican Party as a whole is addressing issues they care about.” Yes, “this polling boost could prove temporary, as it historically does post-convention.” But it still “suggests that it is growing more difficult by the day for the eventual Democratic nominee and down-ballot Democrats to win.” Conservative: Kamala Proves Dems’ Disconnect “The disconnect between progressive policies and the voters will be [Kamala] Harris’s biggest challenge,” argues Spiked’s Joel Kotkin. “With the ascension of Kamala Harris, the Democrats have made a full break from their historic roots as the party of workers,” as “the party’s emphasis will now be on issues like climate change, abortion, reparations and trans advocacy.” “Lunch-bucket Joe” Biden “was something of an anachronism in an era where the white working class, the supposed homebase of the Bidens, has been shifting inexorably” to the GOP. Democrats’ “new party base, concentrated in a handful of cities, as beneficiaries of both government largesse and the stock market boom, has reason to love the current regime. But working-class people are doing less well.” From the right: ’Bam Screws Joe, Dems — Again “President Biden was reportedly stewing over Barack Obama’s role in the orchestrated campaign to force him off the Democratic ticket,” notes The Wall Street Journal’s William McGurn. “For Mr. Biden, it must have brought back unpleasant memories of 2015,” when Obama backed Hillary Clinton over his veep, Biden. Yet the president’s exit now leaves Democrats with a candidate “who didn’t receive a single primary vote.” Had Dems like Obama intervened before the primaries, the party might now have a strong nominee “who enjoyed” full party support. Instead, they gaslit Americans about Biden’s condition. And though, as No. 2 in the White House, Harris herself was in a position know, she too “was happy” to keep it from Americans. “Now she asks them to trust her with the presidency?” Iconoclast: ‘Era of the Noble Lie’ The reason Democrats are scrambling now “— the reason the most basic elements of the Democratic (and democratic) process are being so dramatically challenged — is because of the lie that everyone around Joe Biden told themselves and then told the public,” thunders The Free Press’ Bari Weiss. It’s not just that people like George Clooney “knew about Biden’s condition and lied about it. They knew they were lying and believed they could dupe their supporters.” The “generous read for why Democratic elites chose this path” goes from “If we want to defeat Trump again — and save democracy — let’s stick to the winning horse” to “A few white lies for the sake of the Republic seems a small price to pay.” But that “same thinking” led smearing “anyone who uttered the words ‘lab leak’ as a conspiracy theorist.” It’s time to “Stop spinning, stop lying, and stop the condescension.” — Compiled by The Post Editorial Board","summary":"“It’s far from clear that Harris is the strongest candidate to take on Trump,” observes Michael Barharaeen at The Liberal Patriot.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/07/23/opinion/the-kamala-gamble-a-major-gop-convention-bounce-and-other-commentary/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/2024-race-white-house-biden-85857209_4efc57.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-23 22:55:01","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.12},{"id":252465686,"title":"GOP rep suggests delaying August recess because 'we need to impeach the vice president'","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris is continuing to rapidly consolidate support for her campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination, with President Joe Biden's blessing. Now, Republicans in Congress are hoping to throw a wrench in the works. Politico reporter Olivia Beavers recently tweeted that Rep. Andy Ogles (R-Tennessee) has already introduced articles of impeachment against Harris for \"high crimes and misdemeanors.\" One article is for alleged \"willful refusal to uphold the immigration laws,\" and another is for \"breach of public trust.\" When Beavers asked Ogles about the impending August recess when lawmakers are scheduled to be out of town for the next month, the Tennessee Republican pushed back, saying: \"I have a problem with that. I think we have Appropriations bills to address and we need to impeach the vice president.\" READ MORE: GOP lawmaker admits he lied about lending $320,000 to his campaign: 'Used the stillborn death of a child' \"If our work isn't done, why would we leave?\" Ogles added. Ogles' first article of impeachment appears to be in response to President Joe Biden putting Harris in charge of leading diplomatic efforts to determine the root causes of mass migration from Central America to the United States. Republicans misinterpreted this as Biden making Harris his administration's \"border czar,\" which was never a title she held. However, if the GOP is attempting to suggest that the Southern border is Harris' responsibility, then Harris would have an opening to run on illegal border crossings dropping by roughly 40% since Biden issued an executive order clamping down on asylum applications. The second article of impeachment for \"breach of public trust,\" which blames Harris for allegedly concealing Biden's cognitive health from the public and not invoking the 25th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in order to usurp her boss. While Biden's performance in the June debate with former President Donald Trump was lackluster, he sought to distance himself from that with an hour-long solo press conference at the most recent NATO summit in which he answered complex questions on domestic and foreign policy. It's unlikely that Ogles' impeachment effort will pick up steam, as impeachments of high-ranking members of an administration are typically preceded by public hearings and supported by a significant swath of lawmakers. And with the August recess less than two weeks away it's not likely that any hearings in the House Judiciary Committee to discuss Ogles' articles of impeachment will be scheduled. READ MORE: 'What we need in a president': Biden lauded for 'sharp' answers to questions despite gaffe Ogles' effort to impeach Harris over the Southern border is similar to Republicans' impeachment of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas earlier this year. However, even top Republican lawyer Jonathan Turley admitted his party had no standing to impeach a cabinet secretary over what amounted to a policy dispute. He instead encouraged Republicans to take their disagreements with Mayorkas and the Biden administration to the polls in November. \"There is no jurisdictional question for Mayorkas, but there is also no current evidence that he is corrupt or committed an impeachable offense,\" Turley wrote in January. \"He can be legitimately accused of effectuating an open border policy, but that is a disagreement on policy that is traced to the President.\" Republicans were unable to impeach Biden despite House Oversight Committee chairman James Comer (R-Kentucky's best efforts. Even after multiple public hearings, Comer failed to gin up enough support for his crusade against Biden, and the committee effectively scuttled its inquiry this spring.

Key Democrat Claims 'Time-Sensitive Censorship Issue'","text":"Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Topline Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., called on the House Judiciary Committee to investigate Elon Musk’s X on Tuesday, one day after users on the platform said they were unable to follow Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign account, which Nadler called a “serious and time-sensitive censorship issue” as Harris is at the start of her presidential campaign after President Joe Biden withdrew from the race Sunday. Harris announced her run for president on Sunday. (Photo by KAMIL KRZACZYNSKI/AFP via Getty Images) AFP via Getty Images Key Facts Nadler urged the Republican-controlled committee to request information from X, formerly known as Twitter, regarding the “apparent censorship,” arguing Americans and Harris have a protected interest and right to engage with each other on social media as the vice president makes her run for president, according to a letter sent to the committee’s chair, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio. Specifically, Nadler is seeking an explanation for why certain users were prevented from following the campaign account, the total number of users who tried and failed to follow it, what actions were taken to address the matter and whether Musk was involved in “directing, encouraging, or coercing any employee at X to throttle or limit any user” from following the account. Multiple X users on Monday posted that they were stopped from following Harris’ campaign page and received a message saying they could not do so because a follow limit was reached, with some users claiming they had not actually reached the limit and were able to follow other accounts. X limits the speed at which users can follow other accounts, allowing them to follow up to 400 users per day—though the platform notes the maximum number of accounts users can follow is “different for each account and is automatically calculated based on your unique ratio of followers to following.” The “Kamala HQ” account gained more than 500,000 new followers from Sunday to Monday after Harris announced her run for president and Biden endorsed her. X did not immediately respond to Forbes’ request for comment and Musk has not publicly posted about or replied to the complaints from users claiming they could not follow Harris’ page.

Tangent X has policies and anti-bot measures against the artificial inflation of followers or engagement, although Musk has acknowledged the measures have not worked perfectly, saying in January a spam/scam bot on X accidentally flagged multiple legitimate accounts. Months later, during a bot purge, Musk and X told followers to let them know if genuine accounts were impacted or suspended during the process. Forbes Valuation We estimate Musk’s net worth at $248.7 billion as of Tuesday, making him the world’s wealthiest person. Key Background Harris’ campaign for president began Sunday after Biden dropped out, which came amid intense pressure from dozens of Democrats in Congress to do so following a rough debate performance in June. Harris’ campaign account had around 400,000 followers prior to her announcement, according to screenshots included in Nadler’s letter, and has 1 million followers as of Tuesday evening. X says the “limit reached” message received by users complaining about not being able to follow Harris’ page can come as a result of reaching daily follow limits, following too many accounts too quickly, hitting a follower-following ratio limit or because an account is locked or limited for other reasons. However, in at least one case, an X user claimed they successfully followed other accounts shortly after receiving the “limit reached” message when they attempted to follow Harris’ page.

The 28-year-old put her supermodel credentials on display in a monochrome polka-dot two-piece that brought back memories of the 1960s. Her silky curtains of dark hair fluttered freely in the breeze, and her luminous complexion was amplified with a natural makeup look. After more than a decade of global fame, the reality star and model candidly revealed that she does not 'read criticism' of herself online. 'Social media entails much more than just exposing certain things for the whole world to see. It also means exposing your energy. I take great care to protect my energy and preserve my mental health,' she told Vogue France.

She died last month at the age of 80 after a protracted battle with cancer so brutal that she became a vocal advocate of euthanasia. Kendall's latest magazine cover came as she appeared in a sizzling new set of bikini snaps taken in Mallorca for the fashion brand FWRD. The photo-shoot was billed as a salute to 'Old Hollywood elegance,' and in keeping with the idea, Kendall accessorized her swimsuit with a floral headscarf. All of the pictures were in black-and-white, intensifying the sense of throwback glamour that permeated the new images. Kendall's globetrotting summer plans have included a trip to Puerto Rico with her on-again boyfriend Bad Bunny, who is originally from the island.

'They have crazy busy schedules and know they're still young and have a lot more to experience individually before settling down.' However the source insisted that there was no 'negativity between them' and added that 'Kendall’s family still thinks highly of him.' By the first Monday of this May, Kendall and Bad Bunny were spotted together at a Met Gala afterparty, igniting a feverish round of reunion rumors. A few weeks later an insider confirmed they were back on, explaining to People: 'There wasn't ever any drama in their breakup and they missed each other.' They apparently split last year because they were 'not on the same page in life' and 'needed the break to miss each other enough to figure things out.' The supermodel and the rap star 'always had this crazy attraction to each other,' the insider dished, adding: 'Things are great again.' Bad Bunny, whose real name is Benito Ocasio, was allegedly displeased when he caught wind of the rumors that Kendall was considering getting back together with her previous ex, basketball heartthrob Devin Booker.

Benny is very charming and is always sweet to her.' Kendall's latest sighting comes after her sister Khloe Kardashian revealed what she would do if the two of them were able to swap lives. While Khloe, 39, has her hands full as a mother of two, Kendall is the only one of her siblings not to have any children yet. If she were in Kendall's shoes, Khloe would indulge in the freedom of having 'no kids' and not having 'to wake up for carpool' in the morning. She would throw herself into a party girl lifestyle, enjoying 'a f***ing tequila bottle for breakfast' and 'hooking up with every f***ing person,' she declared. Kendall on the other hand 'definitely doesn't do any of those things, that's why she's wasting her life,' Khloe joked on a recent episode of The Kardashians. 'You're wasting it, Kendall.

Explaining Kamala Harris’s rapid rise","text":"Democrats dragged President Joe Biden for weeks, questioning his physical and mental acuity and whether he could be a winner for them in November. During the Republican National Convention, the idea of former President Donald Trump returning to the White House almost felt like a formality. Fast-forward a few days and Biden’s decision to drop out of the race, and the lightning quick coalescing round Vice President Kamala Harris has re-energized the Democratic Party and gotten the gears of its well-funded political machine going. Within hours of Biden stepping down on Sunday, Democrats, which were divided on a path forward just hours earlier, were all in on Harris. In one afternoon, she had taken control of the president’s enormous political operation, managed to contact more than 100 party officials, labor union leaders, and Democratic heavyweights in Congress to ask for their support. The Biden campaign formally recast itself as “Harris for President,” that very afternoon, giving her access to $96 million in cash. And now, she’s clinched a majority of the delegates needed to shore up the nomination. It helps that no other top Democrat has announced plans to challenge her either. “We have 107 days until Election Day,” she said in a statement. “Together, we will fight. And together, we will win.” People like former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy have complained that the GOP is not up against a candidate but a political “managerial machine,” while conservative strategist Scott Jennings claimed hard launching Harris’s White House bid at record speed might have been something that was always in the works. “I was right, though, that the Democrats would turn to Vice President Kamala Harris as Biden’s replacement,” he said. “Though Harris piously proclaims she wants to ‘earn’ the nomination, anyone can see that the fix is in. Biden was taken out in an undemocratic way, and Harris will be installed through a rigged process. Inspiring.” Others, like Amy Walter of the Cook Political Report, said Harris is benefitting from an unusual set of circumstances. “I think they realized that it was getting late very quickly,” she said. “It’s only three weeks until the convention. We only have four months until Election Day, and that they had spent three weeks basically wringing their hands after the June 27 debate about what to do about Joe Biden, watching their poll numbers really sink very deeply and down ballot candidates really starting to get incredibly nervous about the impact of the top of the ticket on their own races.” In other words, Democrats were waiting and worrying but the second Biden stepped down, it was go-time. Harris has been able to quickly place herself at the top of the minds of donors, delegates, and voters because “Democrats want to turn to the general election as quickly as possible and avoid more chaos and uncertainty,” Elaine Kamarack, founding director of the Center for Effective Public Management at Brookings, said. Harris was also able to shore up support so quickly because people were familiar with her. “Harris passed the vetting test, and four years in the White House was plenty of time for any other skeletons in her closet to be outed. Not so for the other possible candidates,” Kamarack added. It also helps that delegates know and like her. “Throughout this long process, everyone has wanted to know what members of Congress, senators, and former presidents have to say,” Kamarack said. “While their influence is heavy, they have only one vote each. No one has managed to actually poll the several thousand state delegates on this topic. Vice presidents traditionally do a lot of political work, and Harris was no different. Of all the people mentioned as successors to Biden, I bet that aside from Biden, Harris is the person who has actually met the most delegates.” With the momentum rising, Harris’s campaign announced Tuesday morning that it had raised more than $100 million from 1.1 million donors since Sunday afternoon. She also not so subtly went after Trump during a visit to her new campaign headquarters. Harris, a former San Francisco prosecutor who took on “predators” and “fraudsters,” told a cheering crowd, “Hear me when I say: I know Donald Trump’s type.” Behind the scenes, Harris tapped former Attorney General Eric Holder to vet her choice of a potential running mate, the New York Times, citing two people briefed on the matter, reported. Her top two political advisers, Sheila Nix and Brian Fallon, made their presence known on a Monday morning senior staff call on the Biden-turned-Harris campaign. Another thing helping Harris are all of the endorsements coming in from high-profile Democrats like Biden, former President Bill Clinton, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), and Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY), and Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY), to name a few. Former President Barack Obama is the only Democratic big hitter who has yet to endorse her. “President Biden’s very quick endorsement went a long way to make sure the Democratic mayors and other local elected officials across the country united around the vice president,” Cleveland Mayor Justin Bibb told the Hill. Bibb said he was glad it happened fast. “This is a unique opportunity to be united as a party, because this is going to be a hard election,” he said. The excitement for Harris was also palpable among Democratic-allied groups, including the American Federation of Teachers. The union’s president, Randi Weingarten, noted that the convention’s order of business had been changed on Monday to endorse Harris. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER “You’re seeing Democrats from all of the Democratic ideologies; you’re seeing them all come home,” Weingarten said. Even though Harris has been on a roll, Walter warned not to get too comfortable. “They’re conveying the Biden campaign to the Harris campaign, but that’s going to be an integration that’s going to take a little bit of time. I’m sure there are going to be some bumps along the way there,” she said. “And then Harris has to go out and perform as a candidate. She hasn’t had to do that as a candidate since she was on the — well, not even on the trail in 2020, when they were sort of campaigning remotely, and then before that in her failed bid for the nomination. So this is a very different experience that she is going to have to get up to speed on.”","summary":"Democrats dragged President Joe Biden for weeks, questioning his physical and mental acuity and whether he could be a winner for them in November.&#160; During the Republican National Convention, the idea of former President Donald Trump returning to the White House almost felt like a formality.&#160; Fast-forward a few days and Biden&#8217;s decision to drop [&#8230;]","url":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/presidential/3096380/managerial-machine-right-place-right-time-explaining-kamala-harris-rapid-rise/","image":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Kamala-Harris-voters-campaign9833.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-23 22:48:03","author":"Barnini Chakraborty","authors":["Barnini Chakraborty"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.422},{"id":252465822,"title":"Kamala Harris' Husband Douglas Says 'They Are Not Vice President and Second Gentleman' When Together","text":"Kamala Harris is on her way to make history again if she gets officially nominated by the Democrats as the frontrunner to face-off Donald Trump in the presidential elections. The Vice President leads a hectic life however, makes it a case that she gives her family enough attention amid all the political developments. In an exclusive word with People, VP Harris disclosed the dynamics she shares with her husband Douglas Emhoff, and her family. Emhoff who is the first Jewish person to be counted among the big four in the White House revealed, how the duo end and start their day on a daily basis. \"We try to approach those moments as husband and wife, not vice president and second gentleman,\" Emhoff said. Adding on the second gentleman shared, \"It’s really our time to be a couple. The morning check-in is a little more procedural: ‘Where are you today? Love you too. Have a great day.’ But to the extent we’re able to have that connection at night, it’s really couple time: time talking about kids, family and very little about the workings of our days.\" Harris' family includes two stepkids, Cole and Elle. Speaking on her relationship with them, the first woman Vice President of the USA expressed, that she takes pride in the title “Momala” they gave her. \"It’s the name the kids gave me, and I wear it proudly,\" she said. Sharing the sweetest moment she shared with her family recently she said, \"I am my happiest self when generations in my family are getting together and I’m cooking. Recently for the wedding weekend, my baby nieces, my husband gets up early and does his coffee and whatever, and they just came running in my room and then jumped in bed with me, and we just talked and laughed.\" Also sharing her interest in music, the presumptive candidate for the upcoming polls who got endorsed by President Joe Biden disclosed the most sought-after event she attended. The pair's date night in Beyoncé's Renaissance World Tour concert at FedExField in Landover, Maryland last year made headlines for the gaudy outfits they donned according to WWD. Harris sported a golden top with white wide pants paired with pointy silver heels while, Emhoff made a statement in a white shirt, black blazer, and pants with navy blue sneakers. The VP also posted a picture of the two thanking the Single Ladies hitmaker. \"Thanks for a fun date night, @Beyonce!\" she captioned the picture. Calling Break My Soul her favorite song by Beyoncé she said, \"I just love that song. I play it all the time. I think it’s one of the anthems for women . . . when [Beyoncé says] ‘you,’ you could be life, you could be a person, you could be a situation. You will not break my soul.

Rep. Andy Ogles, R-Tenn., is accusing Harris of breaching public trust and of willfully refusing to uphold U.S. immigration law in two impeachment articles, obtained by Fox News Digital. The former article on public trust accused Harris of having \"knowingly misled the people of the United States and the Congress of the United States, principally to obfuscate the physical and cognitive well-being of the President of the United States, Joe Biden.\" It comes as a growing number of Republican lawmakers question what Harris knew and when about Biden's mental state after even allies observed that it had worsened over the course of the 81-year-old's White House term. HOW WOULD A PRESIDENT HARRIS HANDLE IMMIGRATION, BORDER CRISIS? The latter article is targeted at Harris's handling of the crisis at the southern border over her role as the Biden administration's \"border czar.\" She was tasked early on in the administration with addressing the root causes of mass migration from Central and South America. It's now the cornerstone of GOP-led attacks against the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, as states across the country continue to struggle with the migrant crisis, though the number of border crossings has somewhat slowed in recent months compared to the record numbers seen last year. CREATOR OF IMMIGRATION CHART THAT ‘SAVED’ TRUMP'S LIFE FROM WOULD BE ASSASSIN CREDITS ‘PROVIDENCE’ \"Kamala Devi Harris has demonstrated extraordinary incompetence in the execution of her duties and responsibilities, a stark refusal to uphold the existing immigration law, and a palpable indifference to people of the United States suffering as a result of the ongoing southern border crisis in the United States,\" the impeachment articles state. \"During her tenure as the designated border czar, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agency ‘encountered' nearly 302,000 illegal aliens at the southwest border in December 2023, the highest monthly total ever recorded and representing 4 consecutive months of over 240,000 illegal alien ‘encounters.'\" Ogles' impeachment articles are the latest update in the House GOP's legislative offensive against Harris ever since she took up Biden's mantle on Sunday.

Efforts to secure an agreement have been ongoing for months and picked up renewed momentum in late May after US President Joe Biden laid out the details of a plan to bring home the hostages and eventually bring about an end to the war. Now, as the Israeli Prime Minister prepares to deliver a high-stakes speech to Congress on Wednesday and meet with Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday, US officials claim a final deal is within reach. For the families of the hostages held more than nine months in Gaza, there is no time to wait. On Monday, Biden said he believed the different parties were on the “verge of being able to” secure a deal to bring home the hostages and end the war. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Friday that they are “inside the 10-yard line and driving toward the goal line in getting an agreement that would produce a ceasefire, get the hostages home, and put us on a better track to trying to build lasting peace and stability.” US officials insist that Israel and Hamas have both agreed to the broad framework of a deal, but specifics and crucial technicalities need to be hammered out. Mediators from the US, Egypt and Qatar have been leading efforts to finalize those details. A source familiar with the negotiations told CNN Tuesday that an Israeli delegation that was expected to leave on Thursday to transmit the latest Israeli response to the mediators is likely to delay its trip until at least Friday as a result of Netanyahu’s meeting with Biden being postponed until Thursday afternoon. The Israeli prime minister wants to meet with Biden before the Israeli delegation formally transmits its response to the mediators, the source said. The Israeli response is expected to include Netanyahu’s eleventh-hour demands regarding barring armed men from northern Gaza and Israeli control of the Philadelphi corridor – key sticking points in the negotiations. If Hamas agrees to those demands, a deal is likely to follow. “If Hamas will say yes, there will be a deal,” the source said. The latest Israeli response will also coincide with the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, going into recess next week. That will make it harder for any right-wing opponents of the deal to move to collapse the government. US officials have been sensitive to the Knesset recess as they remain convinced that politics are at play for Netanyahu back in Israel. Still, as Israel prepares to transmit its response, it has become increasingly clear to multiple parties involved that clinching a ceasefire now depends on the Israeli prime minister and his government. “It’s really Israel’s decision,” an official familiar with the talks told CNN. There’s real concern among the families of Israeli hostages as to whether Netanyahu is willing to make a deal to end the brutal war, after numerous false dawns suggesting a ceasefire was close. Netanyahu ‘has to take it’ Aviva Siegel, a former hostage whose husband, Keith, is still a hostage, told CNN Tuesday that Netanyahu “has to take it and not continue the war.” “He needs to stop the war for kids to come home and the hostages to come home. They are much more important than continuing the war. They’ve suffered. I’ve been there. I know what the situation is. I know what they’re going through,” said Siegel, who was freed after 51 days in Hamas captivity. There are believed to be 116 people who were abducted during the October 7 Hamas attack remaining in Gaza – 44 of them are believed to be deceased. The families said ahead of Netanyahu’s address to Congress that they expect to hear the Israeli prime minister tell Congress that he has agreed to a deal – anything less, they said, is a failure. The families praised Biden’s leadership on the efforts to bring their loved one’s home but now that the US president has announced he will not seek reelection, they are urging him to ratchet up the pressure to finish the deal – something they say could be a key part of his legacy. The families are expected to meet with Biden and with Netanyahu on Thursday. “Not only should you not all collectively take your foot off the gas but put it on even harder and make sure that part of your legacy, Mr. President, is that you get the credit for saving the lives of as many of these hostages as possible,” said Jon Polin, the father of Hersh Goldberg-Polin. Indeed, the conflict in the Middle East has been a consuming issue for the US president since the October 7 attack. Whether it comes to an end before Biden’s first term will be consequential for his predecessor – whether that is Donald Trump, or possibly Harris, whom Biden has endorsed for the Democratic nomination. When Harris meets with Netanyahu at the White House this week, she plans to convey to the Israeli leader that it is time for the war to end, a Harris aide said. Many Israelis, including family members of hostages, are convinced Netanyahu doesn’t want a deal, instead preferring to extend the war and thereby his grip on power. “We expect from our prime minister to cease all stalling, to cease torpedoing any hope for a negotiated return of hostages and a ceasefire in Gaza to stop the suffering of the people of Gaza,” said Jonathan Dekel-Chen, the father of Sagui Dekel-Chen. “We expect to hear him declare that Israel is going to sign this imperfect, imperfect agreement with Satan, meaning Hamas. But it is a national necessity and anything less than that would be a total failure of his leadership.” Netanyahu, who met on Monday in Washington with families of hostages, said his Israeli government is “determined to return everyone.” “The conditions to bring them back are ripe, for the simple reason that we are putting very strong pressure on Hamas. We are seeing a certain change, and I think this change will continue to grow,” the Israeli prime minister said. However, Daniel Neutra, whose brother Omer is being held hostage, said that “the urgency of the matter did not seem to resonate with” Netanyahu at Monday night’s meeting. ‘Remaining issues’ On Monday, US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said that they “have significantly narrowed the disagreements between the parties,” but there are “a few remaining issues that need to be resolved.” “We continue discussions with the other mediators, and with the Government of Israel to try to reach resolution, but we don’t have that yet, and I don’t have any kind of forecast about when we might come to one,” Miller said. According to an official from a mediating country, the latest proposal from Hamas earlier this month “was very close” to the Israeli position from late May so when Hamas responded, it was believed that Israel’s reaction “would be positive and ready to move forward” with technical teams dispatched to iron out the final details. Negotiators are currently awaiting a response from Israel to a Hamas document received on July 3, according to that official, and recent Israeli responses have been unexpected and unclear, the official said, pointing to Israel’s reneging on a previous, critical position about allowing the unrestricted return of Palestinians to northern Gaza during a pause in the fighting. There’s also significant debate around the Philadelphi corridor and Rafah border crossing, both located between Egypt and Gaza. Netanyahu has argued Israel troops will not withdraw from the nine-mile-long Philadelphi corridor while Hamas has insisted on a full eventual Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, and their response, according to a source familiar, is expected to stick to that demand. A central sticking point has been whether a first pause in the fighting would flow seamlessly into a permanent ceasefire, something Israel has rejected. The Biden framework – and a UN resolution that followed – says the first phase will continue as long discussions do over a second phase. That, theoretically, could mean talks could break down and fighting resumes. Meanwhile, the situation on the ground in Gaza remains dire and US officials involved in the humanitarian and security efforts have grown increasingly frustrated by Israeli aggression in recent weeks. There remains no effective communication between the Israel Defense Forces and humanitarian groups, and just in the last week a UN convoy was shot at by the IDF. US officials believe it is possible that Israelis are seeking to put maximum pressure on Hamas ahead of a deal. If a first phase of the ceasefire is launched, Hamas is expected to release just over 30 hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. Biden’s natioanl security advisor Jake Sullivan acknowledged on Friday that the exact numbers and type of Palestinian prisoners to be released need to be finalized. There is still discussion around the number of vetoes Israel would have over Palestinian prisoners Hamas wants released, with an expectation that Israel would oppose more hardened prisoners serving longer – or life – sentences, according to details provided by the official from a mediating country, who was granted anonymity to discuss the sensitive negotiations. As negotiations on the deal continue, there are also ongoing discussions about security, humanitarian aid, and governance once an agreement is put into place. Those discussions will continue with Netanyahu this week. US and Egyptian officials have begun preparing the flood of humanitarian aid that would enter Gaza if a ceasefire deal goes into effect. Egypt has worked to pre-position nearly 200,000 metric tons of supplies in the northern Egyptian city of el-Arish, one official familiar with the matter said, and talks to prepare for the enormous logistical effort have intensified in the last week. “What we can’t have is an agreement that’s followed by some kind of void that will either be filled, if it’s there, by Hamas coming back, which is unacceptable; by Israel prolonging its occupation, which they say they don’t want to do and is unacceptable; or just having a vacuum that’s filled by lawlessness, that’s filled by chaos, which we see in so many parts of Gaza right now, which is also inimical to actually helping people who desperately need it,” Blinken said Friday. “So making sure that we have a plan in place, which we’ve been working on also every single day – with Arab partners, with Israel, with many others for governance, for security, for humanitarian assistance, for reconstruction – that’s critical.” (Copyright (c) 2024 CNN.

The Trump campaign said that until she is the nominee, contributions made to Biden should not be rolled over to the vice president. “To date, Biden for President has provided no indication that it will return or redesignate all of its general election contributions,” Warrington wrote in the complaint. “Thus, each and every general election contribution received by Biden for President is an excessive contribution.” According to the newspaper, the FEC complaint may not be resolved until the election.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said she is pleased to be proven wrong after predicting that party leaders would try to remove not only Joe Biden but also Kamala Harris from the top of the Democratic ticket. The New York Democrat was one of the last holdouts to keep insisting Biden should remain in the running for 2024, and warned that she’d been a part of conversations where Democrats had discussed pushing out Harris as well. ‘I think that for some of the skeptics and folks that I think there were skeptics that were surprised at that,’ Ocasio-Cortez told DailyMail.com. ‘And I was happy to see the party rally behind her. I do think that I voiced those concerns because of conversations that I had seen and was privy to, in the lead up to that moment, and I’m glad to see that it was countered.’ Since Biden dropped out of the running on Sunday, Democrats have in rapid-fire succession come out behind Harris, who has only a little over 100 days to prove herself to the electorate before November 5. But Harris appears to be off to a good start – she raised $81 million in the 24 hours after Biden dropped out and endorsed her to replace him. ‘That actually shows that there was a major enthusiasm gap between Democrats and Republicans,’ Rep. Jared Moskowitz, D-Fla., said. Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Mich., a friend of Biden, said Harris would draw in young voters and black voters, after Biden was losing support from those demographics. ‘We have to get young people excited. She’s clearly drawing in the African American community,’ she said. ‘The people of Flint, my hometown, the enthusiasm for Harris there, the level of enthusiasm that we’re seeing I’m not, not hyperbole, this sounds like a Joe Biden comment but hundreds of new volunteers walking into our headquarters across the state of Michigan people who are suddenly really excited,’ Rep. Dan Kildee, D-Mich., explained of what he’d seen in the one day since Biden dropped out of the running. But in a late night screed on Instagram live last Friday, the New York Democrat said it is ‘horse s***’ that Democrats are giving anonymous quotes to journalists about how they don’t believe Biden can win the election. ‘If that’s your opinion, and if that’s what you think is best for the country, put your name on it, okay?’ she said. ‘That’s a bunch of horse s***.’ The congresswoman said that former President Trump is ‘also very old, and a racist, and a neo-Nazi.’ She called out a ‘lack of thought’ from Democratic leadership who did not want Biden to run but did not have a fool-proof alternate plan. She warned that much of the newly anti-Biden Democratic establishment would also push out Harris. ‘I’m just going to say it. If you think that there is consensus among the people who want Joe Biden to leave that Kamala, that they will support Kamala, Vice President Harris, you would be mistaken.’ ‘I’m in these rooms. I see what they say in conversations, Ocasio-Cortez said. ‘They are interested in removing the whole ticket.’ ‘A huge amount of donor class and a huge amount of these elites, and a huge amount of these folks in these rooms that I see that are pushing for President Biden to not be the nominee ,also are not interested in seeing the Vice President being the nominee. Will they win out on that? I don’t know.’ ‘To a certain extent, I don’t care what name is on there. We are not losing. I don’t know about you, but my community does not have the option to lose,’ she went on. ‘My people are the first ones deported. They’re the first ones put in Rikers, they’re the first ones whose families are killed by war.’ ‘I’m not here to tell you that if Joe Biden is the nominee, he’s definitely going to win because I don’t think if anybody is the nominee, we’re definitely going to win,’ Ocasio-Cortez also said on Friday. ‘There’s no safe option,’ she admitted. ‘I can’t tell you all how shameful it feels to hear all these leaks about what Democratic leaders are staying and not to have a single one of them out here confirming or denying it,’ the Minnesota Democrat and progressive ‘Squad’ member wrote on X. ‘It’s a lack of leadership and it’s making all Democrats look bad. Whatever this mess leads to will not undo the damage that has already been inflicted. May God help us all.’ A defiant Biden has insisted publicly that he will be the Democratic nominee and only God or a ‘medical condition’ would compel him to bow out. So far, he’s been supported by family members, first lady Jill Biden and son Hunter, in the decision to stay put. Despite the campaign’s best efforts to do damage control, Biden appeared at times confused, rambling and irritable in a Monday evening interview with NBC’s Lester Holt. The official line remains that top Democrats didn’t pressure the president to quit. Progressive activists were left scratching their heads as Squad House members became Biden’s last stalwart of support – even at a time when it is relatively safe to come out against him after the June 27 debate. Ocasio-Cortez, Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., and Rep. Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y., all stood firmly behind Joe Biden remaining at the top of their ticket as now close to 20 House Democrats have urged him to step down. ‘Joe Biden is our nominee. He is not leaving this race. He is in this race and I support him,’ Ocasio-Cortez told reporters earlier this month. Reps. Cori Bush, D-Mo., and Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., have made comments supporting the president.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nRep.

Pritzker as Harris VP: ‘Understands how to work with people’","text":"(The Center Square) – With President Joe Biden no longer the Democratic Party’s nominee, the party’s national convention could be full of intrigue. Nearly 740,000 Illinois voters voted for Biden to be the Democratic nominee for president in the March primary in Illinois, 91% of the votes Democrats cast. Biden announced Sunday he would not seek reelection. He later endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to be the party’s nominee at the convention next month. The endorsements for Harris continue to pour in, including from Gov. J.B. Pritzker. “I am proud to endorse Vice President Kamala Harris for President of the United States,” Pritzker said through his campaign Monday. “It’s important to be thoughtful about what’s next for the Democratic Party and for the country, which is why I spent hours yesterday talking to fellow leaders in our Party getting and giving input about the road to victory in November. I am also cognizant of the unique role we play here in Illinois as hosts of the Democratic National Convention.” State Rep. La Shawn Ford, D-Chicago, is a Biden delegate and urged for a strong ticket. He wouldn’t discount Pritzker possibly being on the ticket as a vice presidential candidate. “And he’s already proven that he understands how to be inclusive,” Ford told The Center Square. “He understands how to have a big tent and work with people.” As for how it plays out on the convention floor, Ford hopes there’s unity for whatever ticket emerges. “Whereas individuals in our party start fighting and possibly causing looting and rioting in the streets,” Ford said. Democrats from across the country meet in Chicago for their national convention beginning Aug. 19. Whoever the party selects to be its presidential and vice presidential candidates will take on the ticket of former Republican President Donald Trump and Ohio U.S. Sen. J.D. Vance in the Nov. 5 election. In May, Pritzker signed a hastily enacted measure prohibiting a statehouse candidate from the November ballot if they didn’t run in a party primary, calling it an ethics bill. State Sen. Jason Plummer, R-Edwardsville, said what’s transpiring at the top of the Democrat’s ticket is hypocritical. “For Illinois state House or Illinois state Senate candidates, if it’s unethical and these backroom deals are terrible, what does it say when it’s the president of the United States?” Plummer told The Center Square. Ford said the national party’s rules are meant to handle such situations. “It’s not even a new process. This is something that is in writing for the Democrats and the Republicans to be able to do in case of emergency, or in the case that the current presumptive nominee is not capable or willing to run again,” Ford said. The Illinois State Board of Elections said Illinois’ ballot won’t be certified until Aug. 23, after the DNC, which begins Aug. 19 in Chicago.","summary":"With President Joe Biden no longer the Democratic Party’s nominee, the party’s national convention could be full of intrigue.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/07/23/us-news/chicago-biden-delegate-wont-rule-out-gov-pritzker-as-harris-vp-understands-how-to-work-with-people/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/85884009.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-23 22:33:23","author":"The Center Square","authors":["The Center Square"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.31},{"id":252467026,"title":"Cows injured after truck crashes into Melbourne bridge","text":"A number of cows have been left with injuries after a semi-trailer ﻿crashed into a bridge in Melbourne overnight.

Harris raised a record-breaking $81 million in donations for her campaign within 24 hours of President Joe Biden dropping out of the race, and the fundraising didn’t stop there. Nearly 100,000 black men and women raised over two million dollars within 48 hours of her announcing her presidential bid. On Monday, journalist and Black Star Network founder Roland Martin co-hosted a “Black Men for Harris” call that raised $1.3 million in four hours for Harris’ campaign. More than 50,000 people joined the stream including John Legend, Don Lemon, Hill Harper, Don Cheadle, Will Packer, Cory Booker, Emil Wilbekin, Sen. Raphael Warnock, and Maryland Gov. Wes Moore. Some on the call joked that it felt more like a frat meeting than fundraiser at times, with several black fraternities representing throughout the evening. Several guests including Sen. Warnock and Gov. Moore, shared personal stories about Harris. CNN contributor Bakari Sellers, who also organized the call, was brought to tears remembering when Harris “stood with me during my darkest moment, when I almost lost my daughter.” (Sellers’ daughter was born with a rare liver condition and received a liver transplant at eight months old in 2019). “Let’s protect Kamala. Let’s be with her, like she was there with us,” he said. Over 44,000 black women joined a Zoom call for Harris on Sunday that raised, $1.5 million. Jenifer Lewis, Bevy Smith, and Yvette Nicole Brown were a few notables on that call. And we hear white women are following suit with their own. Moms Demand founder, Shannon Watts, tweeted out a call “to organize a white women conference call like the Black women and men have to support Vice President Kamala Harris.” Maria Shriver has already signed on. The call is scheduled to happen on Thursday. Meanwhile, Beyonce, arguably the most powerful woman in entertainment, has yet to officially endorse Harris, but is supporting through her song. CNN’s Elizabeth Wagmeister reported the singer granted Harris permission to use her song “Freedom” on the campaign trail. Harris is already putting the song to use. She walked out to it at a stop in Wilmington, Del, on Monday night, and again in Wisconsin on Tuesday. President Biden is planning to address the nation on Wednesday, where he will further explain his decision to leave the race and endorse his VP.","summary":"Don Lemon, Don Cheadle, and John Legend and Jenifer Lewis were a few of the men and women who joined the zoom calls.","url":"https://pagesix.com/2024/07/23/celebrity-news/nearly-100000-black-men-and-women-raise-over-2-million-for-vice-president-kamala-harris-campaign/","image":"https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/85884080.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-23 22:32:27","author":"Carlos Greer","authors":["Carlos Greer"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.192},{"id":252465608,"title":"We are Not ‘DEI Hires’: Why Conservative Media’s Obsession With Minimizing Kamala Harris and POC’s Accomplishments Will Ultimately Fail","text":"Here we go again.

Zelenskiy referred to the conversation in his nightly video address, recalling that Harris had represented the United States at last month’s peace summit in Switzerland. “It is important that the dynamics of our joint work for a just peace do not diminish,” Zelenskiy said. “All our partners at all levels know and will continue to know the prospects for a just peace to be restored as soon as possible.” The United States has been a vital wartime ally of Ukraine, supplying many billions of dollars of military and financial assistance since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022. Harris is seen as most likely to replace Joe Biden on the Democratic presidential ticket after the U.S. president dropped out of the race. Republican ex-president Donald Trump who is standing for re-election has threatened to cut aid to Ukraine if he wins. Zelenskiy’s chief of staff and Gordon discussed further U.S. support and the outcome of an international summit held in Switzerland in June, Yermak’s office said. Kyiv has repeatedly said it will work with whoever is elected in the United States later this year and that it does not want to be seen taking sides in a domestic U.S. matter. A Ukrainian official who asked not to be named told Reuters: “Speaking of … Harris, we believe that two words best describe her potential foreign policy toward Ukraine and Europe as a whole — if she gets elected — continuity and predictability.” But the official added: “At the same time, we are certain that supporting Ukraine is a national, not partisan interest for the United States.”","summary":"President Volodymyr Zelenskiy&#8217;s chief of staff spoke by phone with Vice President Kamala Harris&#8217;s national security adviser, Ukraine said today, the first such call since she emerged as the frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination.","url":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2024/07/23/breaking-news/top-zelenskiy-aide-speaks-with-kamala-harris-adviser/","image":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/web1_2024-07-23T175304Z_757069217_RC2QB8ADR14M_RTRMADP_3_UKRAINE-CRISIS-USA.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-23 22:30:00","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.094},{"id":252465060,"title":"Kamala Harris Has an Independent Women Problem, According to New Poll","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris appears to be trailing among independent women voters since announcing her run for the presidency, per a recent national poll.Harris has made big waves among the Democratic Party since being endorsed by President Joe Biden to take his place at the top of the party's ticket this November. As of Monday, her campaign said that she has secured enough support from delegates to be her party's presumptive nominee, and the last 48 hours have brought in a record number of donations for Democrats.According to a poll conducted by NPR, PBS News and Marist, however, Harris is likely in for a neck-and-neck battle against former President Donald Trump, who formally accepted the Republican presidential nomination last week. The poll released on Tuesday found that Harris trailed Trump by 1 percentage point (45 percent to 46 percent, respectively) across nationally registered voters. In such a close contest, either candidate will have to rely on key demographics—such as independent women voters—to push them to victory in November.Trump, according to the Marist poll, surpasses Harris in this crucial category. Forty-six percent of independent voters surveyed this week said that they would pick the former president in a hypothetical matchup between him and Harris, compared to 32 percent of independents who said they would back the vice president. Breaking down even further, Harris only gained the support of 29 percent of independent women, compared to the 43 percent that said they would back Trump if the election was held today. The poll was conducted on July 22 and includes the response from 1,117 registered voters nationwide.The results are a significant step back from how Biden, who dropped out of the 2024 election on Sunday, was faring among independent women. In an NPR/PBS/Marist poll conducted between July 9 and 10, 48 percent of independent women said that they would back the president if the election was held today. That result followed Biden's rocky first debate performance on June 27, which ignited concerns among Democrats about the president's ability to defeat Trump in November.Newsweek sent an email to Marist Poll for comment on Tuesday.Polling prior to Biden dropping out of the race showed that Harris may have a tough time winning over independent and moderate voters. According to the compiling of polling data conducted by NBC News in January, April and July, Harris has a lower net score than Biden among independents—while Biden's net rating was negative favorability review by 25 percentage points between the three months reviewed, Harris had a net negative of 29 points among independents.NPR pointed out, however, that the most recent NPR/PBS News/Marist poll found that a growing number of independents may be up for grabs following Biden's exit. Nearly 1 in 5 independents indicated in the survey this week that they are undecided when given Harris and Trump on the ballot. Earlier this month, when voters were asked to choose between Biden and Trump, only 4 percent of independents indicated they were undecided.Harris hosted her first rally as the presumptive Democratic nominee in Wisconsin on Tuesday, a pivotal swing state that Biden flipped in 2020 against Trump. Much of her campaign messaging has focused on protecting women's rights and access to abortion, a winning issue for Democrats since the overturn of Roe v. Wade that could help the vice president's popularity among suburban and independent women voters before November.Harris told her supporters in Milwaukee on Tuesday, \"We who believe in reproductive freedom will stop Donald Trump's extreme abortion bans because we trust women to make decisions about their own body and not have their government tell them what to do.\"\"And when Congress passes a law to restore reproductive freedoms as president of the United States, I will sign it into law,\" Harris added while the crowd cheered.","summary":"Harris appears to be trailing former President Donald Trump among independent women voters.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/kamala-harris-independent-women-problem-poll-1929355","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2435175/harris-has-independent-women-problem-poll.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-23 22:28:25","author":"Kaitlin Lewis","authors":["Kaitlin Lewis"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.267},{"id":252465992,"title":"U.S. Embassy Urges Russia To Free RFE/RL's Kurmasheva After  6 1/2-Year Sentence","text":"The U.S. Embassy in Moscow has called for the release of Alsu Kurmasheva, a veteran RFE/RL journalist who holds dual U.S.-Russian citizenship, after she was sentenced to 6 1/2 years in prison by a Russian court on charges she, her employer, the U.S. government, and her supporters reject as politically motivated. Responding a day after news of Kurmasheva's sentencing broke, the embassy said it was \"a sad day for journalism in Russia.\" \"We once again call on the Russian authorities to release Alsu and other imprisoned journalists and prisoners of conscience,\" the embassy said in a post on social media on July 23. \"The suppression of dissenting voices harms all Russians. A free and independent press is at the heart of democracy, enabling voters to make informed decisions and holding public officials accountable,\" it added. The court convicted Kurmasheva on a charge of spreading falsehoods about the Russian military. RFE/RL President and CEO Stephen Capus called the trial and conviction -- first reported by AP -- \"a mockery of justice,\" adding that \"the only just outcome is for Alsu to be immediately released from prison by her Russian captors.\" \"It's beyond time for this American citizen, our dear colleague, to be reunited with her loving family,\" Capus said in a statement. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said late on July 23 that Kurmasheva's case was purely a criminal matter. \"Despite the fact that in the West this topic is presented as an alleged persecution of a journalist, I would like to note that in relation to Kurmasheva, such statements, to put it mildly, are not true,\" TASS quoted Zakharova as saying. \"Her case is being considered exclusively as a criminal case.\" Kurmasheva, a 47-year-old mother of two, was arrested in Kazan in October 2023 and first charged with failing to register as a \"foreign agent\" under a punitive Russian law that targets journalists, civil society activists, and others. She was subsequently charged with spreading falsehoods about the Russian military. RFE/RL and the U.S. government say the charges are reprisals for her work as a journalist for the broadcaster in Prague. \"She’s a dedicated journalist who is being targeted by Russian authorities for her uncompromising commitment to speaking the truth and her principled reporting,\" U.S. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters on July 22 after the news of her conviction. \"Journalism is not a crime, as you have heard us say on a number of occasions, and we continue to make very clear that she should be released,\" he said. The Kremlin has not commented on the conviction. In the past, it has said it is not closely following the case and that it wouldn't commen, as Russia's justice system must be allowed to work through the case. The verdict came on July 19, the same day that Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich was found guilty of espionage charges -- which he, his employer, and the U.S. government have rejected as politically motivated -- by a court in the city of Yekaterinberg. A White House statement on July 19 said Gershkovich was targeted by the Russian government because he is a journalist and an American. Unlike Gershkovich and another American, Paul Whelan, who is serving a 16-year sentence also on espionage charges, Kurmasheva has not been designated by the U.S. government as \"wrongfully detained.\" Such a designation ensures that the case is assigned to the office of the special envoy for hostage affairs in the U.S. State Department, raising the political profile of the prisoner's situation and allowing the U.S. administration to allocate more resources to securing their release. The U.S. National Press Club -- a professional association of American journalists -- and 18 other media freedom groups called on President Joe Biden in an open letter on May 31 to press for the recognition of Kurmasheva as a \"wrongfully detained\" person. \"She meets all the criteria. This should happen immediately. It should have happened months ago,\" the letter said. \"We have listened to the State Department twist itself into a pretzel explaining how there are other factors to be considered besides the criteria, but we have yet to hear a clear reason why [it] cannot declare her wrongfully detained,\" it added. Miller did not address the issue of Kurmasheva's designation with reporters, saying only that the Biden administration remains focused on her case. Russia has been accused of targeting Americans by detaining them on trumped-up charges to later use as bargaining chips in talks to bring back Russians convicted of crimes abroad. Some analysts have said the move to expedite the cases of Kurmasheva and Gershkovich could be a sign that talks are heating up between Moscow and Washington on a possible prisoner exchange. There has been no word on such talks from either Washington or Moscow. Kurmasheva is one of four RFE/RL journalists -- the other three are Andrey Kuznechyk, Ihar Losik, and Vladyslav Yesypenko -- currently imprisoned on charges related to their work. Rights groups and RFE/RL have called repeatedly for the release of all four, saying they have been wrongly detained. Losik is a blogger and contributor for RFE/RL's Belarus Service who was convicted in December 2021 on several charges including the \"organization and preparation of actions that grossly violate public order\" and sentenced to 15 years in prison. Kuznechyk, a web editor for RFE/RL's Belarus Service, was sentenced in June 2022 to six years in prison following a trial that lasted no more than a few hours. He was convicted of \"creating or participating in an extremist organization.\" Yesypenko, a dual Ukrainian-Russian citizen who contributed to Crimea.Realities, a regional news outlet of RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service, was sentenced in February 2022 to six years in prison by a Russian judge in occupied Crimea after a closed-door trial. He was convicted of \"possession and transport of explosives,\" a charge he steadfastly denies.","summary":"The U.S. Embassy in Moscow has called for the release of Alsu Kurmasheva, a veteran RFE/RL journalist who holds dual U.S.-Russian citizenship, after she was sentenced to 6 1/2 years in prison by a Russian court.","url":"https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-rferl-kurmasheva-embassy-release/33047472.html","image":"https://gdb.rferl.org/7870C703-0EA6-4E0B-9251-55D42D967573_w1080_h608.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-23 22:26:11","author":"Rfe/rl","authors":["Rfe/rl"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.144},{"id":252466046,"title":"Lifetime Pennsylvania Democrats are becoming Republicans","text":"TYRONE, Pennsylvania — Shirley Hall has always lived in this charming Blair County borough, located a few miles from the big city of Altoona and once the home of booming coal and paper mill industries. She has also been a Catholic all of her life and for most of it a registered Democrat, two attributes she says are, or at least were, a profound part of her identity. She is still a Catholic, faithfully so, but last week when watching former President Donald Trump walk into the convention hall in Milwaukee just two days after being shot, she changed her voter registration on the spot. In short, she is not just a Democrat voting for Trump come November, but she is now a Republican and will be voting so up and down the ballot. How solidly Democrat was Hall? The retired administrator for a local Catholic church voted for Barack Obama twice and Hillary Clinton in 2016 and did not vote for Donald Trump in 2020. “I didn’t vote for Biden either. I just didn’t vote for either man that year,” Hall said. Hall said a number of things led to her pivotal decision last week. “The last three years had really disheartened me in how my party had handled inflation, never recognizing that it is really impacting people’s lives, but also the border and how that has made accessing drugs even easier for people,” she said. But the 78-year-old grandmother of two said she has great concern for the younger generation because of her grandsons, “not just because of them but because of all young people, with the debt, higher taxes, our education system, our immigration system, and I’ve been really frustrated with the whole thing.” She adds, “I want to tell you, oh, I’m not a big Trump fan when he goes on too much, but I also recognize he can also be very likable. But after the shooting, as an American citizen, I really felt bad.” Hall says she was curious to catch Trump at the convention, something she would not normally watch. “I wanted to see his demeanor, and I was really moved by him when he came in,” she said. “As a matter of fact, I had tears in my eyes when he did. He really looked like he took a blow, not only physically but emotionally, which I’m sure he did.” She added, “I used to work for a priest [who was] a bit gruff and a pain in the butt, and he grumbled and growled and shouted and yelled. And yet he had the wherewithal to feel for people. He did that. Well, that was what I saw in Trump. And I thought, ‘I’m changing my party.’ Click, click, click, click, click. I went into my computer and did it.” The choice of Vice President Kamala Harris to replace President Joe Biden on the Democratic ticket after last weekend’s dramatic turn of events changed nothing for Hall, who said, “First, I like her less than Biden. She is much further left than I am comfortable with for our country. And second, she was shoulder to shoulder with Biden on every big policy decision that has been made the past three years, so she is the same as him only more removed from now former Democrats like me.” Hall’s decision is notable, Chris Borick, political science professor at Muhlenberg College, explained, in that she is not just a Democrat voting for Trump but “she has shed her Democratic Party identity in its entirety, that is as personal to her as her identity as a Catholic.” And Borick said her experience is not anecdotal. “She is part of a shift in party registration in Pennsylvania that has been seismic in this past state that began in 2016 and has accelerated in the past 18 months,” he said. In 2008, the same year Obama won this state by a resounding 10 percentage points, Democrats held a sizable 12% registration advantage over Republicans. In 2022, that number had shrunk in half to a 529,000 Democratic registration edge, and by this year, that number had shrunk even further to 360,982, which is barely a 4% advantage. Republicans have actually surpassed Democrats in the all-important counties of Bucks and Beaver, for the first time ever in the latter. And Borick explains that sometimes registration numbers are lagging indicators. “What I mean by that is that voters have changed their voting patterns before they change their registration,” he said. “So they might vote, have been voting Republican for a long time, or at least since 2016 with the ascension of Trump and the GOP.” “By the way, this is not an easy decision for a voter to make, especially for legacy Democrats in this case that might’ve had family for years be Democrats to say, ‘OK, well, I’m no longer a Democrat,’” he said. “That’s part of our identity. There’s lots of research, by the way, that shows we hold fast to our political identity more so than some of our other identities like religion.” Borick said the effect in Pennsylvania of Harris’s entry into the race is going to be highly scrutinized because of the importance of the state’s 20 electoral votes. While most recent polling showed Trump favored to varying degrees over Harris, CNN polling expert Harry Enten warned on air that number might be tough for her to overcome. “Beating Trump won’t be easy,” Enten said. “His favorable rating is higher now than it has ever been [per two polls taken over the weekend].” Harris may poll better than Biden did against Trump, but Trump is running 5 points further ahead nationally against her than he finished against Biden in 2020. Borick said Harris’s challenges are much the same as Clinton faced in 2016 in that she doesn’t connect with them where they are.“We always try to quantify likability and how people relate to others in the political realm,” he said. “The vice president certainly has contended with those challenges and will, in terms of her connection.” Borick said Harris has opportunities based on identity and her demographics to maybe make some connections that Biden was struggling with. “That’s unquestionable with younger voters, with voters of color. At the same time, does her ability to resonate with voters that are often older and older in a state like Pennsylvania, are those going to be new challenges she faces?” CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER Overall though, Borick said Harris’s challenges with voters here are no different than Biden’s in that they rarely addressed the issues in a way that voters needed them to be meaningful, and “inflation is of course front and center.” “That is part of why I changed my registration,” Hall said. “They never saw me, they never heard me. It was hard for me to leave until I realized they didn’t want me anymore, and then it wasn’t hard to leave at all.”","summary":"TYRONE, Pennsylvania — Shirley Hall has always lived in this charming Blair County borough, located a few miles from the big city of Altoona and once the home of booming coal and paper mill industries.

Harris holds a two-point lead over Trump, 44 percent to 42 percent, according to the Reuters/Ipsos poll. It was conducted in the two days after Biden announced Sunday he was dropping out of the race and endorsing his vice president. In the previous week's poll, Harris, 59, and Trump, now the elder in the presidential race at 78, were tied at 44 percent. Harris, the overwhelming frontrunner for the Democratic nomination who is raking in endorsements and donations as well as pledged delegates, narrowly trails Republican flag-bearer Trump in another survey also released Tuesday. Both results are within the polls' margins of error. The new surveys followed both the Republican National Convention, where Trump formally accepted the party's presidential nomination, and Biden's leaving the race. Harris's performance in the polls, bolstered by the excitement among Democratic voters about the shakeup in the race, shows her apparently neutralizing the bounce that a nominee gets in the days after his or her party's nominating convention. In a PBS News/NPR/Marist poll conducted Monday, Trump edges Harris with 46 percent to 45 percent of US registered voters, with nine percent undecided. If third-party candidates or independents are included in the contest, Trump and Harris are tied at 42 percent, with the others far behind. The PBS News survey notably found that 87 percent of all Americans think Biden's decision to drop out was the right move, a view that crossed partisan and generational lines. A plurality of respondents (41 percent) said Biden's decision increases Democrats' chances of winning in November, compared to 24 percent who said it decreases the party's odds and 34 percent who said it makes no difference. Both surveys come in the aftermath of Trump surviving a shock assassination attempt at a Pennsylvania rally on July 13. Trump maintains a very narrow advantage of 1.6 percentage points against Harris, according to an average of polls collated by RealClearPolitics.

Israel and Hamas are believed to be close to agreeing to a ceasefire, though the two sides have yet to come to a deal as is set to address both chambers of Congress on Wednesday. Eight Americans, not all of whom are alive, are believed to be held by Hamas, which kidnapped roughly 250 people during its Oct. 7 terrorist attack, and the relatives of several of them spoke at a congressional roundtable event Tuesday with the House Foreign Affairs Committee. “I believe at this point, as an Israeli American, that any true friend of Israel today must pressure our prime minister to finish the deal now,” Jonathan Dekel-Chen, the father of Sagui Dekel-Chen, told the committee. Daniel Neutra, whose brother Omer is among the hostages, added that the families met with Netanyahu on Tuesday, and “the urgency of the matter did not seem to resonate with him.” “We must continue to put pressure on all parties involved, including Hamas, to accept this deal now before more people die in captivity,” he added. Netanyahu is expected to receive a warm welcome from the Republican Party, while dozens of Democrats are already expected to boycott his address given the Israeli military’s conduct in the war. Vice President Kamala Harris, now the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee for November’s election, will not attend either, though the officials will meet later this week. Netanyahu is also expected to meet with President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump. Efrat Moshkoviz, the aunt of Naama Levy, who was filmed on Oct. 7 getting dragged out of a jeep bloodied in the crotch area, will be in the audience for Netanyahu’s address. “I want Netanyahu to look us in the eyes and tell us, and he’s doing everything he can, and the deal is right around the corner,” Moshkoviz told the Washington Examiner, though she acknowledged that the families had hoped a ceasefire deal would’ve been announced prior to his address. “We were hoping that would be the case before he addresses Congress altogether, but at the very least here,” Moshkoviz said, she wants to hear “a very specific commitment to getting the deal done, to finding that path that will seal the deal in a matter of not even hours days imminent, and that’s that’s what we’re looking for.” The committee also heard directly from Aviva Siegel, who was held hostage for more than seven weeks and was among the roughly 100 hostages who were freed during the weeklong ceasefire at the end of November. Her husband, Keith, is still being held by Hamas. “I was in Gaza for 51 days, and I saw everything. I felt everything. We need to bring them back. We cannot allow ourselves, as humans, let them go through one more day like I went through,” she said. “I was starved while they ate in front of me. I was thirsty because I didn’t get any water. I was not allowed to stand or walk or move. Most of the time, I had to keep silent completely.” “It’s so difficult to think about what more we were going to go through and what the girls are going through. Now I’m here thinking about Keith and the girls, and it’s too much for me to handle,” Siegel added. “Because I know where they are, and I know who they are with.” Biden said on July 11 that Israel and Hamas had “agreed” to the “framework” of the proposal he laid out publicly back on May 31. “I believe we’re inside the 10-yard line and driving toward the goal line in getting an agreement that would produce a ceasefire, get the hostages home, and put us on a better track to trying to build lasting peace and stability,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said during the Aspen Security Forum last Friday. The proposal Biden laid out, which has been supported by several Western governments, includes three phases, the first of which would last roughly six weeks. During that time, Israeli forces would withdraw from densely populated areas of Gaza, the fighting would cease, a surge of humanitarian aid would flow into the strip, Hamas would release some of the hostages, women and children, while Israel would release a significantly higher number of Palestinians in Israeli detention. During the first phase, the two sides would be able to hammer out the specific details of the second phase though it would broadly include the release of all remaining living hostages and the withdrawal of all Israeli forces from Gaza. The final stage would include the start of the reconstruction of Gaza and the return of the deceased hostages. Israeli President Isaac Herzog declared on July 7, the nine-month anniversary of the Oct. 7 attack, that an “absolute majority” of the country supports a ceasefire deal that secures the release of the remaining hostages.","summary":"The families of the Americans held hostage by Hamas in Gaza have urged lawmakers to push Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to agree to a ceasefire deal that would return their loved ones.

On July 23, the former president told reporters on a press call he would “absolutely” agree to a second presidential debate, his first against Ms. Harris, were she to receive the Democratic Party’s nomination. Moreover, he said he'd be willing to commit to multiple debates. “I agreed to a debate with Joe Biden. But, I want to debate her, and she'll be no different because they have the same policies,” the former president said. “I think debating is important for a presidential race.” He added that he has not yet “agreed to anything” regarding a debate with the vice president. On June 27, former President Trump debated President Joe Biden in a CNN studio in Atlanta. President Biden’s performance raised questions about his ability to challenge former President Trump and created immense political pressure for him to withdraw from the race. Less than a month later, on July 21, President Biden officially dropped out of the race and endorsed his vice president to replace him on the Democratic ticket. On the press call, former President Trump said he believed the CNN debate “was the end of Biden.” “The politicians, you can call them elites, in the party ... they gave him a chance, and they said, ‘If you don’t get out now, we’re going to go after you,’ and that was it,” former President Trump said on the call. President Biden’s departure made him the second president in modern history to not seek his party’s nomination. However, President Biden announced his exit only weeks before August’s Democratic National Convention in Chicago and well after he won the Democratic Party primaries in multiple states. In March 1968, President Lyndon Johnson announced he would not seek reelection. On July 22, Ms. Harris secured the support of the necessary number of delegates to make her the likely nominee. DNC Chair Jaime Harrison said on June 23 that the party will proceed with a virtual vote to select the nominee before the convention. “We WILL have a nominee by the August 7 Ohio Deadline,” Mr. Harrison said on X. The convention will be held in Chicago, Aug. 19–22. Before President Biden dropped out, the two major party candidates agreed to two debates. They eschewed the traditional fall schedule and format set by the nonprofit, nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates. Instead, they agreed to earlier televised debates organized by broadcast news organizations. The next debate is scheduled to be held on Sept. 10 and broadcast by ABC News. Former President Trump said on the call that he is “not thrilled about ABC News” as a host.","summary":"If Vice President Kamala Harris wins the Democratic Party's nomination for president, former President Donald Trump said he will debate her.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/trump-says-hes-willing-to-debate-harris-more-than-once-5692412","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/07/09/id5682658-GettyImages-2159611164-LSedit-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-23 22:21:53","author":"Austin Alonzo","authors":["Austin Alonzo"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.287},{"id":252467612,"title":"What is Kamala Harris’ net worth?","text":"Kamala Harris now looks certain to become the Democratic presidential nominee to take on Donald Trump at the polls in November. Her lengthy career as a state prosecutor and US Senator, combined with her marriage to a successful lawyer means that Kamala Harris’ net worth is significant, though still less than that of her Republican rival. Her campaign – recently rebranded as Harris For President – reportedly pulled in $84m within the first 24 hours of her candidacy being endorsed by Joe Biden. While this money does not go to Harris directly, her current federal government salary as vice president sits at $218,000. Her net worth is currently estimated at around $8m, according to Forbes, which is due in part to a multi-million dollar home in California that her husband Doug Emhoff bought in 2012. The home’s value has surged from about $1m in 2021 to an estimated $4.4m in 2024, according to Forbes. Harris rose to prominence as a prosecutor in California, beginning her legal career at the Alameda County district attorney’s office, before becoming the San Francisco District Attorney, in 2004. In that post, she made $140,000 a year, a salary that increased to more than $200,000 in 2010. Harris took a pay cut in 2010 when she was elected Attorney General of California, which paid her a salary of $159,000, which she took home for the next three years. Harris and Emhoff married in 2014, at which time he was also a prominent attorney with clients including Walmart and healthcare company Abbott Labs. According to financial documents reviewed by ABC News, at this time he earned more than $1m per year and held dozens of investments and stocks in companies such as Home Depot, Comcast, and American Express. When Harris joined the US Senate in 2017, she began earning $174,000 a year. A year later, a report filed by Harris revealed she received an advance of more than $300,000 for her memoir, The Truths We Hold, and she and Emhoff reported a gross joint income of $1,889,156 that year, according to tax returns viewed by ABC News. When she ran for President in the Democratic primary in the 2020 election, Harris’s net worth was estimated to be $6m, boosted by her husband, according to Forbes. At the time she released 15 years of her personal tax returns, the most of any 2020 presidential candidate. In December 2020, Emhoff announced he would leave his law firm, later joining Georgetown University’s law school as a member of the faculty, earning nearly $200,000 per year. As a result of the move, the couple’s income dropped significantly, though Forbes estimates that with their real estate assets and pension, the couple’s net worth is around $8m, up from $7m in 2021. Harris is in pole position to take on Donald Trump for the presidency, a man who has long fought to keep his tax records private. Despite his multiple hefty legal bills, thought to be around $540m, Forbes estimates Trump’s net worth to be $5.9bn, as a result of his real estate properties, clubs and resorts, as well as the value of his share of Truth Social’s parent company. His net worth reportedly jumped up by $1bn following the attempted assassination in Butler, Pennsylvania, according to Forbes.","summary":"As vice president, Harris currently pulls in a salary of $218,000","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/kamala-harris-vp-net-worth-b2584730.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/07/23/20/SEI213883590.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/vNAYvy17-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-23 22:20:35","author":"Mike Bedigan","authors":["Mike Bedigan"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.026}]}
