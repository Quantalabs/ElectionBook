(AP) — California will be the first state to receive federal funds under a program to create regional networks, or “hubs,” that produce hydrogen as an energy source for vehicles, manufacturing and generating electricity, officials announced Wednesday. The U.S. Department of Energy said the California Hydrogen Hub will receive an initial $30 million to begin its planning and design phase. The state will eventually receive up to $1.2 billion for the project that is a key part of the Biden administration’s agenda to slow climate change. The administration in October selected seven regional hubs for the $7 billion program that will kickstart development and production of hydrogen fuel, with the goal of eventually replacing fossil fuels such as coal and oil with the colorless, odorless gas that already powers some cars and trains. The hubs, which include projects in 16 states, will spur more than $40 billion in private investment and create tens of thousands of good-paying jobs, many of them union positions, President Joe Biden has said. The president has called clean hydrogen essential to his vision of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. by 2050. The projects will be based in California, Washington, Minnesota, Texas, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Illinois. All but the California and Texas hubs include projects in multiple states. Pennsylvania has projects in two separate hubs. Frank Wolak, president and CEO of the Fuel Cell & Hydrogen Energy Association, said Wednesday’s announcement is monumental because the Energy Department got through a rigorous competitive process to be at the point now where there are contracts and it’s able to fund the hubs. The money will fund a major infrastructure program and invest in the future of clean energy, he added. “It’s the beginning of really showing what the hubs are going to be doing,” he said Wednesday. “They’re all unique. In the case of California, they’re undertaking projects for using hydrogen for the decarbonization of the hard-to-abate sectors in transportation, among other things. Transportation is a big portion of what they’re going to tackle.” A hub is meant to be a network of companies that produce clean hydrogen and of the industries that use it — heavy transportation, for example — and infrastructure such as pipelines and refueling stations. Hydrogen can be made in ways that yield little if any planet-warming greenhouse gases. The Energy Department says hydrogen, once produced, can generate power in a fuel cell, emitting only water vapor and warm air. The Associated Press","summary":"SACRAMENTO, Calif.

That led to a quick exit from Las Vegas, where the president was originally scheduled to hold a campaign event. The day before, he spoke to the NAACP annual convention, showing no sign of COVID, but plenty of signs of senility. Video of Biden arriving on the tarmac and boarding Air Force One immediately raised eyebrows. To put it succinctly, the president looked completely gone, and it sure didn’t look to be COVID-related. Biden arrives at the airport in Vegas, tells reporter’s he’s “good” pic.twitter.com/68CP0266zk — Jacob Gardenswartz (@reporterjacobg) July 17, 2024 Never has one minute said so much about a man’s condition. The clip starts with Biden getting out of the presidential limousine, but something happens and he appears to freeze. After several seconds, a member of the Secret Service reaches over and helps him stand up. The president then turns to his right and attempts to give a thumbs-up to someone. It appears that he says “I’m good,” though I’m not an expert lip-reader. From there, Biden begins to walk toward the short stairs on Air Force One, hunched over a bit with his arms locked by his side. As has been mentioned before, the loss of motor skills in one’s arms and hands is a hallmark of Parkinson’s disease. Biden then offers a salute before grabbing the handrail on the stairs. A couple of steps up, though, he freezes for a moment, appearing to lose his balance. He then continues in an extremely slow manner and with a very stiff presentation. At the top of the stairs, he again pauses momentarily, and his last few steps appeared heavily labored, as if he almost wasn’t going to make it. The entire sequence was very disturbing, and though I usually try to steer away from conspiracy theories, I’m very skeptical that any of this is a product of COVID-19. I wasn’t the only one either. Many speculated that the real reason behind this sudden departure from the campaign trail was to buy time for Biden and hide deliberations about his future. The only people still testing for covid are trying to get out of doing something. https://t.co/PDbawacWJN — Karol Markowicz (@karol) July 17, 2024 No medical visitor logs in Delaware. https://t.co/PvBImhb3L0 — Stephen L. Miller (@redsteeze) July 17, 2024 I tend to agree. The timing here is far too convenient given news broke on Wednesday morning that Democrat Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has asked Biden to step aside. The DNC also just delayed its nomination process, pushing back its virtual roll-call. Then all of a sudden Biden has “got COVID” and is being rushed off to Delaware and not the White House for what will probably be at least a week of isolation? Yeah, I’m not buying it, and neither is almost anyone else. Something is up here.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nAs RedState reported, Joe Biden is allegedly COVID-positive.

The RNC delegates greeted Navarro with a standing ovation lasting more than a minute. Making light of his time in the joint, Navarro said in jest: “You folks just want to know if you can see the MAGA tattoo that I got in there.” Navarro regaled the audience with the tale of how “Joe Biden and his department of injustice put me there” because the Jan. 6 committee had demanded he “betray Donald John Trump to save my own skin. I refused.” Navarro warned the crowd: “If they can come for me, if they can come for Donald Trump, be careful. They will come for you.” The crowd lustily applauded this convicted criminal when he insisted of his supposed persecution: “They did not break me. And they will never break Donald Trump.” Trump has privately promised to reward for Navarro for holding his tongue and not becoming yet another Trump sycophant-turned-“fucking rat.” (That is a preferred, profane term that former President Trump has often used — especially when privately mocking his ex-fixer Michael Cohen — to ridicule those who’ve turned on him or flipped under pressure from law enforcement.) For days, various sources close to Trump and other Republicans working at the convention reveled in the unveiling of Navarro at the downtown Milwaukee arena, eagerly awaiting and planning it out as a theatrical owning-of-the-libs kind of moment. One Republican close to Trump gleefully messaged Rolling Stone from the arena as Navarro was mid-speech, sending a short video of the former Trump White House official and just one word: “Gangsta.” In the past, Trump so appreciated Navarro’s counsel and his cult-like devotion that Trump bestowed upon him the affectionate nickname of: “My Peter.” The Republican Party has long touted itself as the party of “law and order,” and did so repeatedly during Tuesday night’s programming. But the unprecedented and inescapable outcome of nominating a man convicted of dozens of felony counts is that the GOP convention has become a defiant celebration of criminality and lawless conduct — a festival where obedience to the law is far less important than loyalty to Trump. Trump has been convicted of 34 felonies for falsifying business records in part of a scheme to hide a hush money payment to Stormy Daniels. Daniels has claimed she had an extramarital affair with Trump — the politically damaging news of which threatened to spill into public view in advance of the 2016 election against Hillary Clinton. The party line at the convention is that Trump — rather than being a perpetrator of crime — is in fact the victim of “lawfare” maliciously wielded by his Democratic enemies. (Navarro coined the phrase “lawfare jackals,” to describe those who put him in prison.) Despite the recent gift by a Trump-appointed judge dismissing the felony charges for stockpiling classified documents at his Florida club, Mar a Lago, Trump remains in significant legal jeopardy in the election tampering cases — both on the federal level and in Georgia. For Trump, personally, the biggest upshot of regaining the White House could be the ability to instruct his Justice Department to intervene to drop the federal charges against him. Trump has also pledged to use his pardon power liberally to free the insurgents who stormed the U.S. Capitol on his behalf on Jan. 6. Remarkably — or, inevitably — official merchandise for sale inside Fiserv Forum, where the convention is staged, celebrates the trappings of Trump’s criminal record. T-Shirts and beer koozies are for sale featuring Trump’s mugshot and the slogan “Never Surrender!” Another vendor at the outdoors ConventionFest was doing brisk business selling a shirt reading “I’m Voting for the Convicted Felon,” and another with the number 47 made up of a cross hatch of the words “CONVICTED” and “FELON.” When asked if she saw any irony in selling this kind of merch when Trump’s convention had just staged their law-enforcement-adulating “Make America Safe Once Again”-themed festivities in the arena the night prior, third outdoor vendor simply snapped at Rolling Stone: “It doesn’t count if the crimes are bullshit!” With its recent decision on presidential immunity, the Supreme Court has now endowed the presidency king-like powers — such that as long as presidential conduct can be deemed an “official act,” it is beyond the reach of criminal law that would apply to any other citizen. Trump — the only party nominee with a rap sheet — is poised to be immune from prosecution for any future crimes he might commit, or instruct others to commit on his behalf. In the aftermath of the 2020 election, Navarro authored several dossiers claiming to prove nonexistent fraud in the election. With Steve Bannon, he also helped formulate a plot known as the Green Bay Sweep, seeking to block certification of the Electoral College. Navarro discussed his post election role in an interview with Rolling Stone — but was subsequently convicted of contempt of Congress for refusing to comply with a subpoena to testify under oath. Navarro is not the only high profile RNC conventioneer with significant legal challenges or a flippant view of the laws he chooses not to follow. Longtime Trump lawyer and confidant Rudy Giuliani faces felony charges in Arizona for his alleged role in attempting to subvert the outcome of the 2020 presidential contest with a “fake electors” scheme. Three fellow defendants from this fake elector case received permission from a judge to attend the convention; they are RNC delegates. Giuliani, who made a tumbling entrance at the convention earlier this week, also lost a massive $148 million judgment for defaming a pair of election workers in Georgia. Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz also earned a speaking slot Wednesday. Gaetz was investigated — but will not be facing criminal charges — for his alleged connection to a sex trafficking crime involving a teenager, for which an associate has been convicted. Gaetz remains under a House ethics investigation that is looking into a laundry list of potential misbehavior including whether he “engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, accepted improper gifts, dispensed special privileges and favors to individuals with whom he had a personal relationship, and sought to obstruct government investigations of his conduct.” Regardless, Gaetz used his convention speech to take a jab at playing himself up as a clean politician who doesn’t accept lobbyist money, and said he looks forward to joining Donald Trump and vowed “the swamp draining will recommence soon.”","summary":"The RNC gave Peter Navarro a minute-long standing ovation after his release from jail.

In the Saturday meeting — the purpose of which is apparently the “worst-kept secret” at the Republican National Conference — Schumer is said to have tried persuading the president to step out of the presidential race to make room for another Democratic candidate. “One of the things we all know about the Washington media is that they don’t report everything they know, but often there are rumors that circulate among them,” “Ruthless” podcast host John Ashbrook said on “The Megyn Kelly Show” Wednesday. “What we understand is that Chuck Schumer drove himself or was driven to Delaware to have a personal one-on-one meeting with Joe Biden to make his appeal that Biden should not be the nominee. They’re trying to steal the nomination from this old man.” “Arm wrestle it away,” Kelly jeered. “And apparently it didn’t go over well. What a shock!” The podcasters then posited that Schumer likely arrived with “poll numbers and all kinds of things indicating it was a huge problem for the party down ballot.” “This is the moment, right, Biden said I’ll resign if somebody shows me that I can’t win, so he goes in with polls,” Kelly said. The meeting, “Ruthless” cohost Josh Holmes said, is “the worst-kept secret” in Milwaukee this week. “Every single journalist, whether it’s, you know, you name the publication, we’ve talked to them over the last few days. Every single person knows exactly what happened, but they ask Chuck Schumer, and it’s a one-on-one meeting, and he denies it. So they’re not reporting it.” “I mean, obviously he’s spoken, and so has Biden, to others, and that’s how these reporters get it,” Kelly emphasized. “And you know, they always report things that are not, you don’t get from the direct source. So this is kind of sketchy to me, like there’s a reason they’re not.” She then added: “Now the press has turned on [Biden], so they want this out, probably.” Watch the full segment below. Joined on “The Megyn Kelly Show” by fellow “Ruthless” cohosts Michael Duncan, and Comfortably Smug, the group determined that the meeting — and Schumer’s rumored message — probably didn’t go over that well with the president. Still, despite apparently being an “open secret” with Washington media, there has been little reporting about what the meeting was about. The only thing released was a short statement from Schumer on Saturday: “I sat with President Biden this afternoon in Delaware; we had a good meeting.” That wasn’t enough for Holmes. “If you’re meeting with a nominee of your party, 100 days before an election, and you don’t say, ‘I fully support Joe Biden … our conference supports him, we can’t wait to vote for him in November.’ Something short of that indicates that there’s something else that happened,” Holmes said.

Vance’s 2016 book about the struggles of his childhood was published right around the time he began to quietly cement his ties to a cadre of mega-wealthy tech powerbrokers who could be considered the opposite of the Rust Belt’s working class. Now, as President Trump’s pick for vice president, many elite tech leaders are coalescing around the GOP ticket and expected to help bankroll Trump’s re-election bid. Here are five things to know about why the tech billionaire class is backing Vance, and what it means for the 2024 presidential election. Elon Musk and influential venture capitalists are leading the charge to support Trump/Vance Musk endorsed Trump just minutes after a gunman in Pennsylvania tried to assassinate the former President in Pennsylvania, and he doubled down on the support when Trump announced Vance as his running mate. During his time working in venture capital in San Francisco, Vance became a protégé of Peter Thiel, a PayPal co-founder who is considered something of a kingmaker in Silicon Valley. When Vance ran for Senate, Thiel fueled his run with a $15 million donation. Vance also made inroads with David Sacks, a former tech executive and podcaster who has become a loud cheerleader for Musk since the billionaire acquired Twitter, now X. Sacks recently held a Trump fundraiser at his home in San Francisco, and Sacks this week was a speaker at the Republican National Convention. Trump raked in $12 million at the Sacks event. Using X as a megaphone, Musk and Sacks have been blasting out daily rallying cries for Trump and Vance. “Come on in,” Sacks wrote on X on Tuesday following a list of prominent tech figures now backing Trump. “The water’s warm.” Tech billionaires are already giving millions and expected to turbocharge Trump/Vance campaign Shortly after Vance was announced as Trump’s VP pick, a new tech-aligned super political action committee was unveiled called America PAC. With the backing of the crypto billionaire Winkelvoss twins, the co-founder data analytics firm Palantir Joe Lonsdale, Doug Leone of powerful VC Sequoia Capital and others, the group has raised more than $8 million, according to a recent federal election commission filing. The group’s war chest could turn into a formidable force for the Trump campaign. Andreessen and Horowitz are on tap to pump the group with cash. And the Wall Street Journal has reported that Elon Musk could funnel as much as $45 million a month into the effort. Trump’s Vance pick has drawn praise in crypto circles, with investors hoping for lax regulations of the digital currency. In his latest federal financial disclosure, Vance reported that he owns between $100,000 and $250,000 in Bitcoin. Tech elite see Vance as change-agent on tax policy, AI and crypto regulations Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, who operate the prominent venture capital firm named after them, released a podcast on Tuesday laying out their rationale for backing Trump and Vance. Horowitz said he was reluctant to wade into politics, but that he had no other choice, since “the future of our business, the future of technology, new technology, and the future of America is literally at stake,” he said. The duo said the Biden administration’s proposed regulations for cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence are too heavy-handed. They said they fear a second Biden term would crimp American innovation. Their firm has invested in numerous crypto and AI startups, big bets on those two industries, and as economist Hammond said: “whether that bet pays off depends entirely on the policy of the U.S. government.” Andreessen, who has historically supported Democrats, including, said the “final straw” was his shift away from Biden was the president’s policy aimed at the super rich: a 25% tax on unrealized gains on households that are worth more than $100 million. That kind of levy on the wealthiest Americans “makes start-ups completely implausible,” Andreessen claimed on the podcast. “Venture capital just ends. Firms like ours just don’t exist.” Samuel Hammond, an economist with the right-leaning think tank Foundation for American Innovation, told NPR: “If there’s any unifying ideology to the rising right in Silicon Valley it’s a sense that the system is broken and also the parallel sense that they can build a better system.” Tech billionaires endorsing Trump and Vance as way to rail against perceived ‘wokeism’ While many of the tech moguls supporting Trump and Vance tout policy positions that favor Silicon Valley, another element is that the tech elite are now embracing the GOP ticket as being on the side of a rebellion against liberals. Whether it is railing against diversity, equity and inclusion rules, or policies supporting transgender youth, Musk, Sacks and others in the tech elite used X to go on the offensive on culture war issues. In Vance, not only do they have someone who has called “the DEI agenda a destructive ideology,” but a person who wants to fight the culture war with a background in venture capital. “Many of these guys who previously identified as libertarian are now sort of re-imagining themselves, or pivoting themselves, to a kind of right-wing populism, to Trumpism. And Vance is a really great example of that,” said Max Chafkin, who wrote “The Contrarian: Peter Thiel and Silicon Valley’s Pursuit of Power,” which discusses Vance. “JD Vance is seen as one of theirs,” Chafkin added. “He also has policy positions that can be perceived as being friendly to tech,” he said. “But I think that is secondary to the identity piece of this.” Not all of Silicon Valley is behind MAGA, but support is growing in venture capital world Large swaths of the tech world are still very much deeply liberal. Rank-and-file tech workers at big companies and smaller startups tend to favor Democrats and their donations typically support left-leaning causes. The Information, a technology news site popular in Silicon Valley, conducted a reader survey this week and found that nearly 60% of respondents plan to vote for President Biden in November. Yet when it comes to tech financiers and their elite friends, it is another story, said author Chafkin. “It’s tempting to paint this with a broad brush and say all of Silicon Valley is getting behind the former president, but what’s actually happening is that Silicon Valley’s right wing has been activated and persuaded to open their pockets,” he said. Executives of the biggest companies, like Apple, Nvidia, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon and Google have not endorsed any candidate, keeping with the tradition of Big Tech leadership staying on the sidelines of presidential elections.","summary":"Vance, who has become a darling to the Silicon Valley elite, made inroads in tech and venture capital circles during a stint in San Francisco.

Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said Monday that the number of “encounters” between migrants and authorities at the U.S.-Mexico border decreased by more than 50% in the past six weeks. “The Border Patrol’s seven-day average has decreased to below 1,900 encounters per day,” the agency said in a statement. Biden issued an executive order on June 4 that prevents migrants from making asylum claims at the U.S.-Mexico border at times when crossings between legal ports of entry surge. The order — described by The New York Times as “the most restrictive border policy instituted by Mr. Biden, or any other modern Democrat” — took effect the following day as the seven-day average of illegal crossings by migrants, as measured in terms of “encounters” with authorities, was above 2,500 per day. The new border policy allows authorities to send migrants back to Mexico or to their countries of origin within hours or days without the chance to apply for asylum, even if a migrant believes they have a worthy claim. In order for U.S. authorities to reopen the border to asylum seekers, the number of migrant crossings between ports of entry must remain below a daily average of 1,500 for seven consecutive days prior. CBP said Monday that encounters with migrants between official ports of entry to the U.S. declined 29% in June compared to May. The monthly total of encounters — 83,536 — was the lowest since January 2021, it added. “Recent border security measures have made a meaningful impact on our ability to impose consequences for those crossing unlawfully, leading to a decline of 29% in U.S. Border Patrol apprehensions from May to June, with a more than 50% drop in the seven-day average from the [Biden] announcement to the end of the month,” said Troy A. Miller, a CBP senior official currently serving as the agency’s acting commissioner. Since Biden’s new border policy and an associated immigration rule took effect on June 5, the Department of Homeland Security “has removed or returned more than 70,000 individuals to more than 170 countries, including by operating more than 150 international repatriation flights,” CBP said. “Total removals and returns over the past year exceed removals and returns in any fiscal year since 2010 and a majority of all southwest border encounters during the past three fiscal years resulted in a removal, return, or expulsion,” the agency added. The Hill newspaper reported that the new CBP data “could be a boon for Biden, as border crossings have taken center stage in the 2024 presidential election.” United States Ambassador to Mexico Ken Salazar highlighted the data in a statement. He emphasized that the more than 50% reduction in encounters with migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border occurred “in just six weeks” and declared that the reduction in apprehensions to below 1,900 per day was a “significant milestone.” “… We will continue working to advance the legal [migration] pathways and an orderly, safe and humane migration system,” Salazar said. Mexico has come under pressure from the United States to do more to stop the flow of migrants to its northern border and has recently ramped up enforcement against undocumented migrants. The National Immigration Institute said last month that almost 1.4 million undocumented foreigners were “rescued” and taken to detention centers or facilities operated by the DIF family services agency in the first five months of the year. In addition to sending migrants to detention centers, Mexican immigration authorities “round them up across the country and dump them in the southern Mexican cities of Villahermosa and Tapachula,” the Associated Press reported in June. Following a meeting with U.S. officials in December, Mexican authorities also increased efforts to stop migrants boarding northbound buses and trains. President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has long stressed the need to address the root causes of migration in various Western Hemisphere countries. His government has expanded its employment programs to some Central American countries while calling on the U.S. to increase development funding for the region. The United States Congress should approve a US $20 billion “plan of cooperation for development and well-being,” López Obrador said earlier this year, adding that the aim of such an initiative would be to address the structural causes of migration — things such as poverty, violence and lack of opportunity.

White House Press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said on Wednesday that Biden, 81, was experiencing “mild symptoms” and will fly to his home in Delaware, where he will “self-isolate and continue to carry out all of his duties fully”. Jean-Pierre said Biden planned to spend a long weekend at his Delaware beach house. It was unclear how long the sickness would keep him for the campaign trail. Minutes after the announcement, the president’s motorcade was on the move to the Las Vegas airport, and as he boarded Air Force One, Biden told reporters: “Good, I feel good”. Dr Kevin O’Connor, the president’s physician, said in a note that Biden “presented this afternoon with upper respiratory symptoms, to include rhinorhea [runny nose] and non-productive cough, with general malaise”. After the positive COVID-19 test, Biden was prescribed the antiviral drug Paxlovid and has taken his first dose, O’Connor said. News of Biden’s illness had first been shared by the CEO of Unidos US, a Latin civil rights group, in Las Vegas. Biden had been slated to speak at the group’s convention on Wednesday afternoon as part of an effort to rally Hispanic voters ahead of the November election. Janet Murguia, the CEO of Unidos, told guests that the president had sent his regrets and could not appear because he tested positive for the virus. “He said to tell my folks that we’re not going to get rid of him that quickly, we’re going to have a chance to hear from him in the future directly,” she said. There were groans in the conference room at the news. ‘Serious concerns’ The president’s diagnosis comes amid intense scrutiny of his health and stamina after a disastrous debate with former President Donald Trump that sparked a flurry of concern among Democrats that Biden is not up to the rigours of winning another presidential term. Shortly before the news, Congressman Adam Schiff, an influential member of the Democratic Party, urged Biden to drop out of the race, saying he has “serious concerns” about the president’s ability to beat Trump. “While the choice to withdraw from the campaign is President Biden’s alone, I believe it is time for him to pass the torch,” Schiff said in a statement. “And in doing so, secure his legacy of leadership by allowing us to defeat Donald Trump in the upcoming election.” A poll released by the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research on Wednesday showed that nearly two-thirds of Democrats believed Biden should drop out of the race and allow the party to choose a new candidate. Only about three in 10 Democrats also said they were extremely or very confident that Biden has the mental capability to serve effectively as president, down slightly from 40 percent that said the same in a February poll. Still, The Associated Press news agency and other US media outlets have reported that Democrats are looking to hold a virtual vote to formally make Biden the nominee in the first week of August. That’s ahead of the Democratic National Convention, which is being held in Chicago from August 19 to 22 and is typically where the party’s presidential nominee would be confirmed. Biden meanwhile has been defiant in the face of the calls to quit the race, telling one interviewer that only the “Lord Almighty” could persuade him to go. The US leader last tested positive for COVID-19 twice in the summer of 2022, when he had a primary case and a rebound case of the virus. Biden has been vaccinated and is current on his recommended annual booster dose for COVID-19. The vaccines have proven highly effective at limiting serious illness and death from the virus, which killed more than 1 million people in the US since the pandemic began in 2020. Paxlovid has been proven to curtail the chances of serious illness and death from COVID-19 when prescribed in the early days of an infection, but has also been associated with rebound infections, where the virus comes back a few days after clearing up. Health officials have reported recent upticks in emergency room visits and hospitalisations from COVID-19. There has also been a pronounced increase in positive test results in much of the country – particularly the southwestern US.","summary":"White House says the US president has &#039;mild symptoms&#039; and will self-isolate at his home in Delaware.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/17/biden-tests-positive-for-covid-cancels-las-vegas-campaign-event?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2024-07-17T223916Z_1755905292_RC2AX8AL7ZMY_RTRMADP_3_USA-ELECTION-BIDEN-1721259909.jpg?resize=1904%2C1080","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-17 23:47:18","author":"Al Jazeera,Apps Support","authors":["Al Jazeera","Apps Support"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.419},{"id":252025178,"title":"How Ex-President Donald Trump Has \"Changed\" After Surviving Assassination Attempt: Insider Reveals","text":"Donald Trump survived an assassination attempt and according to an insider, he may have a new perspective on life. A Florida lawmaker in touch with the ex-president's inner circle revealed that the Republican front-runner is a \"changed man\" post the shooting incident. Trump, who's running for the presidential elections in November, was attacked by a 20-year-old gunman during his rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. A self-described born-again Christian, Rep. Maria Salazar, spoke to someone \"very close\" to the 78-year-old who said the changes in Trump are so apparent that everyone around him can feel his sense of awakening. \"He believes that God has given him another opportunity. He believes that God spared his life and that he is a – I'm not sure if spiritual is the word or the adjective. I'm not sure if it's more contemplative. But I do know that he is a different man,\" Salazar told Daily Mail. Trump made his first appearance at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee after being injured amid a cheering crowd. While he was the same man who could boldly walk into a room and command the space, something about his changed demeanor at the convention took everyone by surprise. His \"eyes were closed\" during the benediction and he \"prayed the whole time.\" Salazar further revealed, \"That changes you as a person,\" referring to the attempt on his life. \"And when you change as a person internally because somehow the powers of heaven have touched you, then you start leading a different life … This is like BC and AD.\" She also insisted that God gave Trump a \"second opportunity\" to unite the divided Americans. Meanwhile, the politician's eldest son Donald Trump Jr. echoed the same sentiment and described how the gunshot impacted his father. Speaking at an Axios event, Don Jr. was asked \"How long will this new Trump last?\" The doting son responded, \"You know, I think it lasts. There are events that change you for a couple [of] minutes and there's events that change you permanently.\" However, he also noted that the politician will reign in his rhetoric, \"Now again, it's Trump, so you're still going to be reactionary.\" He also noted that his presidential hopeful father is a \"fighter\" who wouldn't surrender in front of his critics. \"He's going to be tough when he has to be. We've seen that, he's never gonna change. But I think there will be something. I think these are momentous occasions that change people permanently,\" as per USA Today. In the wake of the shooting incident on July 13, 2024, Trump's campaign has changed the MAGA tone toward \"unity,\" insisting the ex-president has \"changed.\" However, in his latest unhinged post after Judge Aileen Cannon dismissed his Classified Documents case, the businessman-turned-politician was back with the same rhetoric of being a victim of political persecution with his usual vocabulary like \"Witch Hunts\" and \"Zombie case.\" On Truth Social, he wrote, \"As we move forward in Uniting our Nation after the horrific events on Saturday, this dismissal of the Lawless Indictment in Florida should be just the first step, followed quickly by the dismissal of ALL the Witch Hunts.

Peskov was commenting on statements made by Trump in an interview with Bloomberg published on Tuesday. During the interview, Trump stated that he “got along very well” with Russian President Vladimir Putin during his tenure and added, “We were never in danger of a war.” When asked whether he would lift or ease anti-Russian sanctions to help settle the Ukraine conflict, Trump did not give a direct answer but instead said he did “not love sanctions,” arguing that such measures are “forcing everyone away from” the US. The US did “nothing good for Russia under Trump,” Peskov said, commenting on Trump’s remarks. He specifically mentioned that “new restrictions” were imposed against Moscow at that time and stated that Russia considers all such sanctions to be “illegitimate” steps that only “destroy the basis of international economic relations.” “Still, there was dialogue. That could be counted as a positive element,” Peskov added. According to the Carnegie Endowment, the US imposed sanctions against Russia on at least 40 occasions during Trump’s four years in office. Washington also withdrew from a key Cold War-era arms control agreement – the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty – in 2019, leading to its collapse later that year. Despite existing tensions, the two nations maintained some dialogue. Trump personally met Putin in Helsinki during a summit in 2018, as well as on several other occasions throughout his presidency. Trump’s successor, Joe Biden, has not talked to Putin since the start of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine in 2022. The last phone call between the two presidents took place in late December 2021. Relations between the two nations have since plummeted to their lowest point since the Cold War, according to Moscow. Last week, Biden stated that he had “no good reason” to talk with his Russian counterpart, including about the Ukraine conflict. In June, Peskov stated that Russia was ready to hold talks with the US but only if such dialogue is “comprehensive” and includes not just Washington’s agenda but also takes Russia’s concerns into account.","summary":"Relations between Russia and the US have not been easy under Donald Trump, but at least there has been dialogue, the Dmitry Peskov has said \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/russia/601239-kremlin-trump-us-relations-dialogue/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.07/article/66984fdb85f5400ac33a8465.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-17 23:44:51","author":null,"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.255},{"id":252025080,"title":"Biden’s devil’s deal with the hard left is an attack on America and the Democratic Party — and a gift to Trump","text":"In his desperate bid to fend off the Democratic revolt, President Biden is now pandering hard to the hard left — selfishly putting his own desires ahead of his party’s interests and the nation’s needs. The first two shoes he’s dropped, a push for national rent control and a so-called “Supreme Court reform” package of term limits and an ethics code, are terrible ideas and flagrantly unconstitutional. “Today, I’m sending a clear message to corporate landlords: If you raise rents more than 5% on existing units, you should lose valuable tax breaks,” vowed Biden ahead of addressing the NAACP convention in Las Vegas. In his actual speech, the failing prez misread the TelePromTer, pledging to limit rent-hikes to “$55.” Of course, rent control is a disastrous policy that, as Democratic Colorado Gov. Jared Polis immediately warned: “This kind of cap would lead to less affordable housing being built and substantially increase hosting costs.” His high-court “reforms,” meanwhile, are an outright attack on an equal branch of the federal government, aimed squarely at subordinating the justices’ independence from the political branches — an independence that has protected Americans’ rights for 235 years. Sounds like an attack on our democracy to us. Until now, Biden had avoided any major support for the left’s war on the court as an institution, but it’s become a cause celebre on the left, which he now sees as his best hope to not lose the party’s nomination for a second term. (His other big gambit: Pushing for a soon-as-possible virtual roll call with delegates to lock in the nomination ahead of he convention, supposedly to comply with an Ohio ballot-qualifying law that’s already been amended to avoid the issue, not that he’s winning Ohio this year anyway.) Of course, it may not be Joe, but Hunter and Jill, behind this strategy: They’re practically his only his top advisers at this point in his rapid decline. Yes, rapid. He could at least read a script smoothly until now, but the NAACP mistake is only his latest TelePrompTer fail: “Battle box” for “ballot box” came Sunday night. And when aides handed him a note during Saturday’s Zoom with House Democrats, he read it out loud: “Stay positive, you are sounding defensive.” At another point in that call, he angrily dissed the military record of Rep. Jason Crow (D-Colo.), an Army Ranger who earned the Bronze Star for his combat actions in the Iraq invasion. Overall, reports on the call say he was “rambling” and “even worse” than during the debate. Plus, his live ABC and NBC interviews were both disasters. In short, his efforts to show he’s not losing it instead are showing he is — while the polls he either isn’t shown or won’t read show him headed to a landslide loss in November that will drag multiple Democratic candidates down with him. Responsible party leaders are plotting behind the scenes to dump Joe, and the Bidens know it: Hence the attempted devil’s bargain of red meat for the hard left. As we’ve noted, the left calculates that its power within the party will rise if Biden loses in November: That’s what happened the last time Trump won, and since Biden’s theoretically a “moderate,” his defeat will let lefties claim that’s why he lost. Yet the fact that the president is embracing hard-left ideas now elevates them within the party — indeed, makes them part of the party’s brand in voters’ minds. That is, his selfish gambit is further reducing the Democratic Party’s appeal to centrist voters in the runup to Election Day. This, while almost getting killed has inspired former President Donald Trump to turn the GOP convention into a unity fest reaching out to swing voters and broadening Republicans’ appeal. In short, the Bidens are crippling Democrats, boosting the GOP and warring on democracy: It’s the ultimate trifecta of selfishness.","summary":"In his desperate bid to fend off the Democratic revolt, President Biden is now pandering hard to the hard left — selfishly putting his own desires ahead of his party's interests and the nation's needs.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/07/17/opinion/bidens-devils-deal-with-the-hard-left-is-an-attack-on-america-and-the-democratic-party-and-a-gift-to-trump/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/jb45554.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/jOXXOXyo-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-17 23:44:41","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.276},{"id":252024836,"title":"Trump's Former Doctor Ronny Jackson Tells RNC: 'Never, Ever Been Prouder'","text":"Texas Rep.

The former president and Republican nominee in 2024 made the revelation in an extensive interview with Bloomberg Businessweek a few days before the fateful debate with President Joe Biden. When Mar-a-lago’s long-serving managing director came by during the course of the interview, Trump said “with pride” that the club was upping its fee by $300,000 in October and opening four slots for new members. The increased fee could be an indication of the rising value of being near Trump as he looks poised to possibly return to the White House. Trump bought Florida’s Mar-a-Lago in 1985, converting it into a private club nine years later. It has been his primary residence since 2019 when he officially left New York and became a Florida resident. During his time as president, he hosted world leaders at the club such as the late Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Chinese President Xi Jinping. On July 11, Trump hosted Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban at the club. Biden’s debate performance shocked many as he appeared confused and frail. Trump has taken the lead in multiple polls following the debate – in FiveThirtyEight’s polling average, he leads Biden by 2 percentage points as of Wednesday. “The debate certainly had a big impact,” he told Bloomberg on July 9, just four days before the assassination attempt at a rally. Trump was struck by a bullet in his right ear before he was quickly covered by Secret Service agents. Two people, including the gunman, were killed in the shooting and two people were critically injured. “A lot of the states are just starting now to come out, and it shows a very big swing,” Trump told Bloomberg after the debate. The former president was asked if his opponent should step aside as the Democratic nominee. “That’s a decision he has to make,” he said. “But I do think our country is in great danger whether he stays in or drops out.”","summary":"The former president bought Mar-a-Lago in 1985, converting it to private club nine years later","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-mar-a-lago-initiation-fee-b2581590.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/07/17/21/GettyImages-2161438889.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/QqDhMFFQ-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-17 23:37:04","author":"Gustaf Kilander","authors":["Gustaf Kilander"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.168},{"id":252024948,"title":"Joe Biden, the President of the United States, contracts COVID-19","text":"President Joe Biden has tested positive for COVID while campaigning and trying to fight back against widespread calls for him to drop out of the 2024 race due to his age.

Biden, who was not wearing a mask, gave a thumbs up, and said: ‘I feel good’. The White House physician said Biden was feeling ‘general malaise’ and will now self-isolate in Delaware. The West Wing added that the president is vaccinated and boosted, and took a dose of Paxlovid on Wednesday afternoon. Earlier on Wednesday he had been speaking to supporters at a restaurant in Las Vegas while Democrats reignited calls for him to step down from the 2024 presidential race. In an interview this week he said he would only drop out if doctors told him to and he had a medical reason that made it necessary. ‘If I had some medical condition that emerged, if somebody, if doctors came to me and said, you got this problem and that problem,’ Biden said in an interview with BET news. The president’s physician, Dr. Kevin O’Connor, has said Biden is mentally and physically fit to serve as commander-in-chief. But many Democrats have questioned Biden’s fitness to serve since his debate performance against Donald Trump last month, in which he fumbled for words and at times stared blankly into the camera. Biden, meanwhile, has repeatedly changed his stance on what it would take for him to step aside. He told ABC News he would only drop out only if the ‘Lord Almighty’ told him to. At a press conference in Washington D.C., he said he would stay in the race unless aides came to him with proof that he could never win. In an interview with BET, Biden said for the first time that he had expected to ‘move on’ from the presidency and ‘pass it on to somebody else’ after one term. But he decided to run again because he believed his ‘wisdom’ and experience would help heal the country.’ ‘You may remember, I said I was going to be a transitional candidate, and I thought I would be able to move on from this and pass it on to somebody else,’ Biden said. ‘But I didn’t anticipate things getting so, so, so divided. And quite frankly, I think the only thing age brings is a little bit of wisdom.’ He added that ‘there’s more to do, and I’m reluctant to walk away from that.’ Janet Murguía, the CEO of Latino civil rights organization UnidosUS, announced Biden’s positive test as she confirmed he would not be appearing at a scheduled event in Las Vegas. She said : ‘Thank you all so much for your patience and understanding. Regrettably I was just on the phone with President Biden. ‘And he shared his deep disappointment at not being able to join us this afternoon. ‘The President has been at many events as we all know and he just tested positive for COVID. So of course we understand that he needs to take the precautions that have been recommended and he did not obviously want to put anybody at risk.’ In a statement White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said: ‘Earlier today, following his first event in Las Vegas, President Biden tested positive for COVID-19. ‘He is vaccinated and boosted and he is experiencing mild symptoms. ‘He will be returning to Delaware where he will self-isolate and will continue to carry out all of his duties fully during that time.’ She said he would ‘continued to carry out the full duties of the office while in isolation.’ The President’s doctor, in a statement, said Biden had presented with ‘upper respiratory symptoms’ including a ‘runny nose’ and ‘cough with general malaise’. The doctor said: ‘He felt okay for his first event of the day but, given that he was not feeling better, point of care testing for COVID-19 was conducted, and the results were positive for the COVID-19 virus. ‘Given this, the President will be self-isolating in accordance with CDC guidance for symptomatic individuals. ‘His symptoms remain mild.’ He added that Biden’s temperature was normal.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nPresident Joe Biden has tested positive for COVID while campaigning and trying to&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Joe Biden, the President of the United States, contracts COVID-19 first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/joe-biden-the-president-of-the-united-states-contracts-covid-19/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/1721259359_rewrite-this-title-President-Joe-Biden-tests-positive-for-COVID.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-17 23:36:59","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.336},{"id":252024596,"title":"Joe Biden's Appearance After COVID Diagnosis Goes Viral","text":"A photo of an unmasked President Joe Biden in front of reporters after news broke of his COVID-19 diagnosis went viral on social media on Wednesday evening.White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Wednesday evening that earlier today, Biden tested positive for COVID-19 after a campaign event in Las Vegas.Minutes after Jean-Pierre's statement was released, CNN White House and politics reporter DJ Judd shared a photo of Biden on X, formerly Twitter, and wrote: \"An unmasked President Joe Biden flashes a thumbs up to reporters on the tarmac before boarding Air Force One moments after the White House announced he tested positive for Covid-19 here in Las Vegas, Nevada.\"When reporters asked how he was feeling, Biden said, \"I feel good,\" according to Judd.The post has already gotten 32,900 views in the past hour.Meanwhile, a video posted by Alex Salvi, a foreign correspondent for Newsmax, showed Biden boarding Air Force One.

Officials said the snipers spotted the suspect, 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, on the roof of a building outside the security zone at the rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, at 5:52 p.m. ET. The shooting happened at 6:12 p.m. ET, 20 minutes later, the sources said. In the days since the shooting, the Secret Service has come under scrutiny for its response to the assassination attempt and the agency's director, Kimberly Cheatle, has been subpoenaed to testify before Congress. A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said she \"welcomes the opportunity to testify.\" The revelation of the timeline came as sources told ABC News that Crooks searched on his phone for images of President Joe Biden and former President Trump and searched for the dates of Trump’s rally in Butler and for dates of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. The phone search history revealed no indication of Crooks’ political views and investigators were trying to determine his motive. The FBI director, his deputy director and the head of the Secret Service told lawmakers Crooks was identified as a person of interest a full 62 minutes before the shooting took place, according to the law enforcement officials and lawmakers briefed. According to the sources, the timeline presented in the briefing was as follows: 5:10 p.m. Crooks was first identified as a person of interest5:30 p.m. Crooks was spotted with a rangefinder5:52 p.m. Crooks was spotted on the roof by Secret Service6:02 p.m. Trump takes the stage6:12 p.m. Crooks fires first shots From the time Crooks fired his first shot to the gunman being killed was just 26 seconds, according to law enforcement officials. Eleven seconds after the first shot, Secret Service counter snipers acquired their target -- and 15 seconds after that, Crooks was shot dead. Briefers told lawmakers that Crooks purchased an ammunition box at a Walmart on July 5, two days after the rally was announced. On July 13, he went to the rally site in the morning, was there for an hour and then left. He came back sometime in the early 5 p.m. hour and tried to enter the security perimeter at around 5:30 p.m.. New analysis by ABC News' visual verification team reveals that one of two sniper teams posted atop buildings to the north and south behind the rally stage repositioned before the first gunshots were fired. At 6:09 p.m., two minutes before the first gunshots rang out, the sniper team on the roof of the building south of the stage, the furthest away from the shooter’s location, repositioned, turning in from the south to the north in the direction of the shooter’s location. The motive for the assassination attempt remains a mystery, according to the briefers, and they have not identified any ideological nexus to former President Donald Trump and/or President Joe Biden. Based on interviews with the shooter's parents, law enforcement told members they believe that neither has strong political leanings. The FBI told lawmakers they've conducted 200 interviews as part of the investigation, a source said. Timeline comes into focus Crooks was able to get a clear shot at the former president by climbing onto the air conditioning unit of one building and making his way to the top of an adjacent structure where he fired from, sources told ABC News. Minutes before pulling off the brazen assassination attempt, he was seen walking around near the magnetometers where rallygoers were being scanned for weapons before entering the outdoor venue, according to law enforcement sources. New bystander video obtained exclusively by Pittsburgh ABC affiliate WTAE appears to show Crooks pacing just beyond the boundaries of the Trump rally at 5:06 p.m. Saturday -- about 1 hour and 5 minutes before shots were first fired. Law enforcement sources said they believe this video shows Crooks. Crooks' presence in the area of the metal detectors in the minutes before the shooting caught the eye of someone in law enforcement who became suspicious and started to approach him, multiple sources told ABC News. At that point, the would-be assassin backed up and faded into the crowd, according to sources. It was not clear how long before the shooting this happened. Between the time he was spotted near the magnetometers and when Crooks allegedly fired at Trump, there were two sets of radio transmissions, one reporting that police were looking for a suspicious person and another more generic warning that officers were following up on something suspicious, sources said. As officers began searching for the suspicious person, Crooks made his way to the area of the American Glass Research (AGR) building outside the security perimeter established for the event, the sources said. At the time, the building was being used as a staging area for local police, who were inside the structure, the Secret Service director, Cheatle, told ABC News in an exclusive interview this week. More specifically, sources told ABC News that there were local police personnel and counter-sniper units in the AGR building where Crooks eventually took up a position to fire at Trump, sources said. Investigators believe that could have led to confusion as Secret Service snipers were trying to determine whether there was a threat to Trump and where it might be coming from, according to the sources. Secret Service counter snipers positioned on buildings close to the rally stage were aware the AGR building was being used as a staging area by law enforcement, sources said. Investigators believe that could have led to a split-second delay in the Secret Service sharpshooters' reactions because they had to first figure out whether the suspect was a threat, sources said. But once shots were fired at the former president, the Secret Service snipers could not wait any longer and took out the gunman, sources said. \"I don't have all the details yet, but it was a very short period of time,\" Cheatle said during the interview with ABC News. \"Seeking that person out, finding them, identifying them, and eventually neutralizing them took place in a very short period of time, and it makes it very difficult.\" Meanwhile, two sources familiar with the situation told ABC News Wednesday that before the rally, the Secret Service requested a local police cruiser to be positioned at the AGR building, but local police officials were not able to provide one. The detail was first reported by the Washington Post. Crooks was killed at the scene by a Secret Service sharpshooter positioned atop a building behind the stage Trump was speaking from at the Butler Fairgrounds, the Secret Service said. Though law enforcement sources said Crooks is believed to have purchased a 5-foot ladder at a Home Depot before the shooting, it does not appear to have been used to climb on the roof and was not found at the scene. Investigators believe Crooks made his way to the spot where he fired from by scaling an air conditioning unit of an adjacent building accessible from the ground and pulling himself up onto the roof, sources said. From there, he managed to gain access to the top of the neighboring building, where witnesses told ABC News they saw him shimmying up the slope of the roof to the area where he got off up to eight shots at Trump who was speaking at a podium about 400 feet away, according to law enforcement sources. As the FBI investigation continued Wednesday, questions swirled about how the gunman was able to ascend unimpeded to the roof, gain a direct line of sight and fire a barrage of shot at the former president. While Crooks was making his way to his shooting position, Secret Service agents were listening to radio traffic about a suspicious person police were looking for and heard local law enforcement talking about some sort of confrontation involving police, the sources said. Butler County Sheriff Michael T. Slupe told ABC News that he was informed by other law enforcement officials that a Butler Township police officer searching for the suspicious person was vaulted onto the AGR building's roof and briefly confronted the gunman, who turned his weapon to the officer, causing him to retreat back down. Shots rang out moments later. Suspicious devices Investigators said Tuesday they found a remote transmitter in the suspect's pocket that may have been intended to set off two suspicious devices found in the suspect's car and one in his home, according to law enforcement sources. Devices at both locations were similarly constructed in ammunition containers using components including receivers that appear to have been paired with the remote control found in the suspect's pocket, sources said. The receivers in each device were connected to a series of components that investigators say met the \"eye test\" -- having parts present that could have made viable explosives, although the functionality of the devices is still being determined. The purpose of the devices is also unknown. Whether they were intended to cause a significant blast to hurt people or if they were designed to create smoke, fire and a low-grade blast for a diversion is unclear. Investigators also found a tactical vest in the suspect's car, though it is unclear why he did not wear it during the assault on the former president's rally. Some investigators are wondering whether he anticipated dying in the attack. The shooter also asked his employer if he could take a day off on Saturday but said he would return to work perhaps as soon as Sunday, the day after this attack, according to law enforcement sources. But thus far, investigators have turned up nothing to suggest that he had any accomplices or other support to carry out his deadly objective. 'Bullied' in the past An examination of his phone, which the FBI has now unlocked, has not turned up any significant information about the suspect's motives -- only what sources described as \"routine\" information for a 20-year-old male. Investigators have found, so far, that Crooks was a loner without friends. He was “odd,” according to preliminary findings in the probe, multiple sources briefed on the investigation told ABC News. FBI analysts are trying to assess whether Crooks was hard to get close to or was shut off because he was hiding something, sources said. Crooks had been “bullied” a little in the past, but the acts against him were “not over the top,” one source said. Investigators are actively looking to see if perhaps Crooks covered his tracks by using “burners” or other communication devices. The Pennsylvania State Police said in a statement that it provided \"all resources\" to the Secret Service -- including 30 to 40 troopers to assist with securing the inside perimeter of the campaign rally venue -- but \"was not responsible for securing the building or property\" outside the security perimeter where the would-be assassin opened fire. In an exclusive interview with ABC News, Cheatle, the Secret Service director, confirmed that local police were present inside the building at the same time the shooter was on the roof firing at Trump. Cheatle also said that local authorities were tasked with securing that building. \"In this particular instance, we did share support for that particular site and that the Secret Service was responsible for the inner perimeter,\" Cheatle said. \"And then we sought assistance from our local counterparts for the outer perimeter.\"","summary":"Twenty minutes passed between the time USSS snipers first spotted Crooks on the roof and the time shots were fired at the former president, new information shows.","url":"https://abcnews.go.com/US/trump-assassination-attempt-investigation-continues-new-details/story?id=112020474","image":"https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/f7077556-a611-46b3-914e-22850fbaab83/rally-site_1721207692334_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-17 23:33:09","author":"Aaron Katersky,Emmanuelle Saliba,Jack Date,Jessie Dimartino,Josh Margolin,Luke Barr,Pierre Thomas","authors":["Aaron Katersky","Emmanuelle Saliba","Jack Date","Jessie Dimartino","Josh Margolin","Luke Barr","Pierre Thomas"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.609},{"id":252025618,"title":"Jeffrey Katzenberg Warns Biden Hollywood Donors Have Stopped Writing Checks After Debate Fallout","text":"Presidential campaign co-chair Jeffrey Katzenberg met with President Joe Biden ahead of his scheduled appearance in Las Vegas on Wednesday to warn him that donors have stopped contributing to the campaign since the disastrous debate with Donald Trump. Biden cancelled the appearance when he announced he has COVID. The Hollywood power broker told Biden that many major donors are doubtful in his ability to win the election in November. TheWrap reported two weeks ago that Hollywood donors were furious at Katzenberg for vouching for the president’s physical health, and said they were moving their donations to other Democratic campaigns. The Biden campaign responded to TheWrap: “This is a complete misread of a private meeting. We had a campaign meeting where we talked about everything from the convention to new ads. And by the way, we will raise the money we need to run a winning campaign.” Katzenberg did not immediately respond to a request for comment Since a disastrous debate performance and subsequent unconvincing public appearances, Democratic support for the 81-year-old president from Hollywood donors is running thin. George Clooney, a lifetime Democrat and co-host of a recent fundraiser for the Biden campaign, was one of the first A-listers to rescind his support for the president’s re-election. In his op-ed in The New York Times, he called for the president to drop out for the sake of democracy. Other influential Hollywood figures, including Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings, showrunner Damon Lindelof and Disney heir Abigail Disney, have all publicly called for Biden to step aside. Many others have said behind closed doors that they will stop donating to the Biden campaign and redirect their dollars to down-ballot races. Many of these lifelong Democratic supporters put the blame on Katzenberg, as one of Biden’s closet confidants and campaign co-chair. “What Jeffrey Katzenberg has done here is unbelievable,” one Hollywood power broker, donor and influential Democrat who declined to be identified, told TheWrap. “Jeffrey lied about the whole Biden thing. The whole Biden inner circle lied… It’s such an act of hypocrisy.” The Biden campaign was already behind in fundraising in the second quarter ahead of the debate with only $240 million against his running mate’s $285 million.

Jim Wolpman Walnut Creek While Democrats dither, authoritarians rally These past weeks have been easy for Republicans. While hand-wringing Democrats and the media have focused on President Biden, Donald Trump met with Viktor Orban, the Hungarian prime minister. Orban has systematically dismantled his country’s democracy, taken control of the media, legislature and judiciary, yet Trump and some Republicans have endorsed and praised him and his methods. Project 2025, a plan developed by a long list of former Trump administration officials and the Heritage Foundation, promotes similar methods: dismantling the Department of Education, replacing civil servant employees with loyalists, and granting near absolute power to Trump. If there is any hand-wringing going on, it should be due to the frightening scenario of another Trump presidency.

People are for me so we can get things done,\" Gingrich said, \"and I need somebody who believes in what we're doing.

It made him a national name when it was published in 2016. The book is now seen as a window into some of the cultural forces that propelled Trump to the White House that year. RNC Day 3 live updates: Vance to make prime-time speech Still, most Americans - and Republicans - don't know much about Vance. According to a new poll from the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, which was conducted before Trump selected the freshman senator as his vice presidential choice, 6 in 10 Americans don't know enough about him to form an opinion. About 2 in 10 U.S. adults have a favorable view of him, and 22% view him negatively. Among Republicans, 61% don't know enough to have an opinion of Vance. About one-quarter have a positive view of him, and roughly 1 in 10 have a negative view. His wife, Usha Chilukuri Vance, will speak Wednesday night, too, according to a person familiar with the program. Beyond Vance's primetime speech, the Republican Party focused Wednesday on a theme of American global strength. Speakers were to include family members of service members killed during the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan and of someone taken hostage during the Oct. 7 attack in Israel, the person said. Republicans contend that the country has become a \"global laughingstock\" under Biden's watch and were expected to hit on their theme to \"Make America Strong Once Again.\" That's expected to include Trump's \"America First\" foreign policy that redefined relationships with some allies and adversaries. Democrats have sharply criticized Trump - and Vance - for their positions, including their questioning U.S. support for Ukraine in its defense against Russia's invasion. In a video released Wednesday by Biden's reelection campaign, Vice President Kamala Harris dismissed Vance as someone Trump \"knew would be a rubber stamp for his extreme agenda.\" \"Make no mistake: J.D. Vance will be loyal only to Trump, not to our country,\" Harris says in a video. Vance has become one of Trump's most aggressive defenders as the former president has sought the office a third time, sparring with journalists, campaigning on his behalf and appearing with the candidate at his trial in New York. Trump did a walk-through at the convention center Wednesday, in preparation for his prime time address to delegates Thursday. It will be his first public remarks since the assassination attempt on Saturday in Pennsylvania. Earlier this week Trump indicated that he tossed out his old speech, and drafted a new one focusing on unity. Trump spent time practicing his entrance, and adjusting his stance.

And I'm not going to reach out to someone who isn't us.'\" Vance is an Ivy League graduate and a businessman, but his memoir \"Hillbilly Elegy\" explores his blue-collar roots. It made him a national name when it was published in 2016. The book is now seen as a window into some of the cultural forces that propelled Trump to the White House that year. RNC Day 3 live updates: Vance to make prime-time speech Still, most Americans - and Republicans - don't know much about Vance. According to a new poll from the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, which was conducted before Trump selected the freshman senator as his vice presidential choice, 6 in 10 Americans don't know enough about him to form an opinion. About 2 in 10 U.S. adults have a favorable view of him, and 22% view him negatively. Among Republicans, 61% don't know enough to have an opinion of Vance. About one-quarter have a positive view of him, and roughly 1 in 10 have a negative view. His wife, Usha Chilukuri Vance, will speak Wednesday night, too, according to a person familiar with the program. Beyond Vance's primetime speech, the Republican Party focused Wednesday on a theme of American global strength. Speakers were to include family members of service members killed during the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan and of someone taken hostage during the Oct. 7 attack in Israel, the person said. Republicans contend that the country has become a \"global laughingstock\" under Biden's watch and were expected to hit on their theme to \"Make America Strong Once Again.\" That's expected to include Trump's \"America First\" foreign policy that redefined relationships with some allies and adversaries. Democrats have sharply criticized Trump - and Vance - for their positions, including their questioning U.S. support for Ukraine in its defense against Russia's invasion. In a video released Wednesday by Biden's reelection campaign, Vice President Kamala Harris dismissed Vance as someone Trump \"knew would be a rubber stamp for his extreme agenda.\" \"Make no mistake: J.D. Vance will be loyal only to Trump, not to our country,\" Harris says in a video. Vance has become one of Trump's most aggressive defenders as the former president has sought the office a third time, sparring with journalists, campaigning on his behalf and appearing with the candidate at his trial in New York. Trump did a walk-through at the convention center Wednesday, in preparation for his prime time address to delegates Thursday. It will be his first public remarks since the assassination attempt on Saturday in Pennsylvania. Earlier this week Trump indicated that he tossed out his old speech, and drafted a new one focusing on unity. Trump spent time practicing his entrance, and adjusting his stance.

The project is a part of President Joe Biden’s Investing in America agenda that involves legislation such as the American Rescue Plan, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and the Inflation Reduction Act. He said the investment in bridges is the largest “since the Eisenhower era.” “There are currently about 3,000 fewer bridges in poor condition than when our administration began, and today we are proud to announce funding to repair or replace 13 of America’s largest and economically significant bridges.” The Federal Highway Administration’s Bridge Investment Program awarded the restoration grants to 13 state transportation departments. The $1.2 trillion Bipartisan Infrastructure Act authorized the disbursement of $40 billion for bridge repairs over five years. Oregon will receive $1.4 billion for a complete replacement of two vertical lift bridges connecting Portland, Oregon, to Vancouver, Washington. “The modern, seismically resilient, and multimodal replacement bridges will provide safe and accessible options for driving, walking, biking, rolling, and riding transit,” the DOT said. “The project will help reduce travel times and congestion along this critical corridor, improve safety and quality of life, and lower carbon emissions.” Massachusetts will get $993 million for the Sagamore Bridge Replacement Project in Cape Cod, Massachusetts. The bridge is frequently congested and has a high crash rate, the DOT said, Alabama will get $550 million to replace its Mobile River Bridge and fund its Bayway Project. “This federal funding will be a game-changer, not just for Mobile and Baldwin Counties, but for our entire state and region,” Ms. Ivey said. Tennessee will receive $394 million for a project to replace a 75-year-old bridge that connects Memphis, Tennessee, to West Memphis, Arkansas, crossing the Mississippi River. “The new I-55 Bridge will not only enhance safety and efficiency, but also improve multimodal connectivity and strengthen our economic vitality by facilitating smoother freight movement and improving accessibility in our region.” Rhode Island will receive $251 million for the improvement of 15 bridges “critical to the local economy” of Providence, Rhode Island, the DOT said. North Carolina will get $242 million for the replacement of the 54-year-old Cape Fear Memorial Bridge in Wilmington, North Carolina, and South Carolina will get $175 million to replace four bridges crossing Lake Marion in Santee, South Carolina. Other restoration grant awards will be doled out to the Oklahoma Department of Transportation at $124 million; Miami-Dade County in Miami, Florida, at $101 million; the West Virginia Department of Transportation at $88 million; the New Mexico Department of Transportation at $72 million; and the Kansas Department of Transportation at $63 million. “These grants are helping to advance critical bridge projects across the nation that will improve overall quality of life and ensure this country’s infrastructure works for everyone,” Federal Highway Administrator Shailen Bhatt said.","summary":"A federally funded $5 billion restoration project of large bridges is underway that will repair 13 &#8220;nationally significant&#8221; bridges in 16 states.

On the heels of President Joe Biden’s call for “unity” that was viewed as laughable by RNC-goers Monday in light of years of vitriolic rhetoric toward MAGA Republicans and Trump — who was nearly assassinated on Saturday —Breitbart News briefly spoke with one of Trump’s attorneys, Alina Habba. WATCH — CNN’s King: “Donald Trump Is in Command” the Numbers Are Getting Worse for Biden: “I think if you take a look at how they’ve attacked [Trump] every sort of way, the fact that I am now well-known because I’ve had to be on courtroom steps for the last three years fighting for him, the only divisive party I’ve seen is the Democrat party and Joe Biden’s administration,” Habba stated. “It’s a shame, it’s a sham, and I think it’s important the American people are waking up,” she added. Rep. Cory Mills (R-FL), a staunch Trump supporter, spoke with Breitbart News about the “hypocrisy” on the left, pointing to charged rhetoric from the likes of President Joe Biden and Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) over the years. “This is the exact same party who claimed to be the party of peace, the party of law and order, even though they are out there saying, ‘Defund the police,’ painting it on the streets, even though they were out here saying things, like Maxine Waters, ‘You need to be able to get in the face of all of your elected officials,’” Mills noted. “Or Joe Biden’s comment, which is so inflammatory and dangerous, where he says, it’s time to put Trump in the ‘bullseye.’ And now we’ve seen what’s happened.” WATCH — Maxine Waters: If Trump Wins in November There Will Be Violence, “More Killings”: “When President Trump made the comment we should go home peacefully, that was enough to create a J6 unselect Committee, which was illegitimized, and they went after the president for saying that he incited violence,” he added. “They’re the exact same people who are now saying that they defend law enforcement, the exact same people who said we believe in unity.” According to the Florida congressman, the political maneuvering on the left, driven by the party’s progressive win, illustrates division. “The hypocrisy and the political shifting within the Democrat party shows that they’re in a division right now where their progressive left wing of it, where everyone’s starting to pander to, is taking over the identity of their party,” the Congressman went on to add. “Here’s the best part: The Democrats will forecast and tell you their playbook; whatever they’re accusing us of is the very thing that they actually are doing.” WATCH — Biden: Shouldn’t Have Said to Put Trump in Bullseye, I “Meant Focus on” His Rhetoric, Policies: Outside Panther Arena, a few blocks south of the Fiserv Forum, Rep. Carlos Giménez (R-FL) emphasized that the GOP is unified while simultaneously pointing out that many Democrats are trying to move Biden out of the top of the ticket. “We’re united. Look, they’ve always said that we’re not united because we just within the party, we may have some differences of opinion, but we’re pretty much united in the direction we want the country to go in, and we have been for a very long time. The Democrats just fall in line. They do what they’re told to do, and that’s not really good for the country,” he said. “They’re all frazzled now because they say that we were a threat to democracy, and yet, hey, they’re trying to find a way to somehow get rid of their democratically nominated presidential candidate. So isn’t that something? Who’s really the threat to democracy here?” he added. Breitbart News also interviewed West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, the Republican gubernatorial nominee in the Mountain State. Morrisey said Trump’s policy vision unites people because it bests Biden’s inflation-driving policies, and “regardless of where you are from, people know that President Trump has an optimistic view of America.” The attorney general sees Trump’s America First policies and themes — “making America wealthy again, making America safe again, promoting energy independence, ending lawfare, enforcing the rule of law,” as “resonating with everyday Americans in a way that the Democrats can’t.” WATCH — WV AG Patrick Morrisey on the WV Governor’s Race, Battling the Administrative State: Matthew Perdie & Jack Knudsen “So many of the Democrat policies under Biden are so radical,” Morrisey said, adding that “they are doing absolutely nothing about” the fentanyl epidemic. He also pointed to Biden’s electric vehicle policy. “They’re trying to advance a mandatory electric vehicle policy, which would be economically disastrous for our country,” Morrisey said. “Their policies are doing nothing but driving inflation through the roof. President Trump and the Republican Party have a good answer for that, and that’s why you’re seeing people unify, because better policies, better people in place, and that’s why we’re going to win.” Morrisey also complimented Trump on running an “incredible” campaign and said his pick of Sen. JD Vance (R-OH) as his running mate “is going to help ensure that we win in November.” Virginia Republicans senate candidate Hung Cao told Breitbart News that the left is “motivated by hate” while Republicans “are motivated by love.” “The left is motivated by hate directed at one man. They will stop at nothing, all the way up to and including violating the will of their own voters, the millions who voted for Joe Biden in Democratic primaries earlier this year,” Cao wrote in a statement. “But we are motivated by love: love of God, love of family, and love of country — the greatest nation on Earth. We are united as Americans, and we will win.” Journalist Jack Posobiec spoke with Breitbart News outside the Panther Arena and underscored that “Donald Trump has always stood for unity.” “Donald Trump has always said, ‘Make America Great Again,’” he stated. “It was always the left; it was always the left-wing media that was adding words to that statement. They were the ones who said, ‘Make America Great Again only for a certain group of people.’ Donald Trump has always said make it great again for all Americans.” “He defines people as Americans and not Americans. So just your basic understanding of what is an American; that’s it. He never stood for division,” Posobiec, the host of Human Events Daily on Real America’s Voice added. “He never went in for this stuff, and there were times where people tried to push him to do so, famously at Charlottesville, and they completely twisted his words, lied about what he said to put him into their box. So he’s stood for unity for 10 years, and I think finally, finally, people are waking up to it.” One man who can be seen at every Trump Rally sporting a brick pattern suit, Blake Marnell, who goes by the nickname “Brick Suit,” told Breitbart News that Democrats “sowed the division” in America. Marnell said, “It certainly seems to be the dynamic” that Republicans are united and the left is fractured and called out Democrats for being dividers of America at large. “And it’s not only is the left divided within itself, but let’s not forget that they’re the ones who put the wedge in the log and swung the hammer,” he said. “Joe Biden going up in a podium and calling everybody who supports President Trump MAGA extremists, and blaming us all for that… they sowed the division, and now they’re going to reap it.” The unity on the right and the apparent in-roads Trump and Republicans continue to make, evidenced by a slew of polling, are also backdropped by deep tensions within the Democrat Party over Biden’s handling of the Israel-Hamas. Widespread protest efforts from progressives, young voters, Muslims, and Arab-Americans are further threatening his election bid, as documented in the grassroots “Uncommitted movement,” which saw hundreds of thousands of Democrat primary voters reject him this cycle.","summary":"MILWAUKEE, Wisconsin — Prominent Republicans at the Republican National Convention (RNC) emphasized to Breitbart News on Wednesday that the GOP is, in fact, the party of unity while the Democratic Party is the party of division.\n\n\nThe post Exclusive – Prominent Republicans at RNC Say GOP Party of Unity: ‘Only Divisive Party I See Is the Democrat Party’ appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/2024-election/2024/07/17/exclusive-prominent-republicans-rnc-say-gop-party-unity-only-divisive-party-see-democrat-party/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/07/GettyImages-2155367581-640x335.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-17 23:22:46","author":"Nick Gilbertson","authors":["Nick Gilbertson"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.225},{"id":252025076,"title":"Trump campaign trolls Biden over VP debate","text":"There can be no vice-presidential debate until the Democrats can decide on their ticket, the Republican campaign said on Wednesday, in a thinly veiled reference to calls for US President Joe Biden to step down. The Republicans formally nominated former President Donald Trump on Monday, while he announced Ohio Senator J.D. Vance as his running mate. Vice President Kamala Harris reached out to Vance with an offer of a debate, to be hosted by CBS News. “We don’t know who the Democrat nominee for Vice President is going to be, so we can’t lock in a date before their convention,” Trump campaign senior adviser Brian Hughes said in a statement on Wednesday evening. “To do so would be unfair to Gavin Newsom, JB Pritzker, Gretchen Whitener, or whoever Kamala Harris picks as her running mate.” The governors of California, Illinois and Michigan, respectively, have been floated as possible replacements for Harris should Biden withdraw from the ticket. Many Democrats have been clamoring for the 81-year-old to do so, since his disastrous showing in the June 27 debate against Trump. California Congressman Adam Schiff, formerly a key player in the House Intelligence Committee, was the latest to urge Biden to “pass the torch.” While Biden has refused to drop out of the race – or resign from the presidency – in a recorded interview aired on Wednesday he revealed the circumstances under which he might do so. “If I had some medical condition that emerged,” this might make him reconsider, Biden told BET. He insisted he was still fit for the job, however. Speculations about ousting Biden from the ticket were temporarily relegated from the headlines by the attempted assassination of Trump on Saturday. The Republican candidate narrowly escaped death at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. The US Secret Service has yet to give a satisfactory explanation how a shooter was able to get into position to open fire on the stage, killing one rally-goer and seriously injuring two more. However, efforts by some Democrats to oust the president have apparently continued, with the New York Times claiming on Wednesday that a group of Democrat megadonors were “dangling money to members of Congress” willing to publicly call on Biden to step aside. Harris has proposed three dates for the VP debates: July 23, August 12 and August 13. The Democrats are scheduled to hold their convention in Chicago on August 19, but want to nominate Biden via a “virtual roll call” before then.","summary":"The Republican presidential campaign has declined the offer to debate Kamala Harris until the Democrats pick Joe Biden’s replacement \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/601240-republicans-kamala-vance-debate/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.07/article/6698517885f5400ac33a8472.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-17 23:22:11","author":null,"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.361},{"id":252024912,"title":"Biden Tests Positive For Covid As Age Worries Mount","text":"US President Joe Biden tested positive for Covid on Wednesday, shortly after conceding that he would consider dropping his troubled reelection bid if he was diagnosed with a serious medical condition. The 81-year-old Democrat gave media the thumbs up from his limousine and said \"I feel good\" as he cut short a campaign trip to Las Vegas following the diagnosis. The White House said he was suffering from a runny nose, cough and \"general malaise,\" was taking Covid medication, and was flying straight to isolation at his beach house in Rehoboth, Delaware. The diagnosis came hours after the release of comments by Biden in an interview conducted on Tuesday, in which he said he could step aside as a presidential candidate \"if I had some medical condition that emerged.\" It was also the latest development over a dramatic few days in the already frenetic and polarized White House race that saw his rival Donald Trump survive an assassination at a campaign rally of his own. Biden has been fighting for political survival since a disastrous debate against Trump nearly three weeks ago, in which his tired and confused appearance sparked concerns about his age. White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Biden had tested positive shortly after the first in a series of events in Las Vegas targeting crucial Latino voters. \"He is vaccinated and boosted and he is experiencing mild symptoms. He will be returning to Delaware where he will self-isolate and will continue to carry out all of his duties fully during that time,\" Jean-Pierre said. Biden's doctor said he was suffering from a runny nose and a \"non-productive cough\" along with \"general malaise,\" the White House said in an accompanying note. He has received the Covid drug Paxlovid and has already taken his first dose, the statement read. \"His symptoms remain mild, his respiratory rate is normal at 16, his temperature is normal at 97.8 and his pulse oximetry is normal at 97 percent,\" it added. - 'I feel good' - Biden later leaned out of his limousine, dubbed the Beast, as he arrived at a Las Vegas airport to give the thumbs up. \"Good,\" he said to the press as he walked to Air Force One without a mask. \"I feel good.\" Janet Murguia, the president of the Unidos union for Latino workers, told the crowd about the diagnosis shortly before the White House announcement. \"I was just on the phone with President Biden, and he shared his deep disappointment at not being able to join us this afternoon,\" she said. The furor over Biden's health is now set to go into overdrive, with a growing number of Democrats calling on him to step aside. Asked what could make him rethink his presidential bid, Biden told the Black media outlet BET in an interview taped Tuesday in Las Vegas: \"If I had some medical condition that emerged, if somebody, if the doctors came and said 'you've got this problem, that problem.'\" He suffered a major blow hours earlier on Wednesday when a top Democrat, Representative Adam Schiff of California, urged Biden to \"pass the torch.\" \"A second Trump presidency will undermine the very foundation of our democracy, and I have serious concerns about whether the President can defeat Donald Trump in November,\" Schiff said in a statement to the Los Angeles Times. Around 20 House Democrats and one senator have now called on Biden to leave the White House race. Most polls show Biden trailing the election in a tight race with Trump. Biden insists that Democratic voters support him, but a poll by the Associated Press and NORC Center for Public Affairs Research said Wednesday that nearly two-thirds want him to step aside.

President Joe Biden has said he would send troops to defend the island. In Taiwan, Premier Cho Jung-tai responded that Taiwan is “willing to take on more responsibility” and would defend itself. In a statement, Taiwan’s de-facto embassy in Washington said it is in the interest of the U.S. and the international community to preserve peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait because it is an indispensable part of global prosperity. “As the threat of military coercion increases, Taiwan is doing its part by actively strengthening deterrence capabilities with the support of the United States under the Taiwan Relations Act,“ the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office said. As the rivalry between Washington and Beijing heats up, Taiwan — an island that broke away from mainland China in 1949 following a civil war — has become one of the thorniest issues in U.S.-China relations. Beijing claims sovereignty over the island and vows to take it by force if necessary to achieve unification. Washington insists any differences be resolved peacefully and U.S. law obligates it to supply Taiwan with hardware and technology for self-defense. In the past several years, ties between Washington and Taipei have grown stronger, as Beijing ratchets up military and diplomatic pressure on the island. Last month, the Biden administration approved a $360 million weapons sale to Taiwan, sending the island hundreds of armed drones, missile equipment and related support material. Taiwan pays for the military equipment. Citing the arms sale and other unspecified U.S. moves to undermine Beijing’s interests and trust between the two countries, China’s foreign ministry announced Wednesday it was canceling talks with the U.S. on arms control and nonproliferation. “The responsibility full lies with the U.S.,” said Lin Jian, a spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry. In the interview, Trump said he didn’t feel “so secure” over the Taiwan Strait, where Beijing has “been very aggressive and got ships all over the place.” He suggested that China could easily take over the island but has not done so because of Taiwan’s prized semiconductor industry, which make the computer chips that power everything from smartphones to cars and satellites. “That’s the apple of President Xi’s eye,” Trump said, referring to Chinese President Xi Jinping. He suggested that Taiwan has a stranglehold on the computer chip industry over the U.S. and because of that, it has the means to pay. “I mean, how stupid are we? They took all of our chip business. They’re immensely wealthy,” Trump said. Rep. Michael McCaul, chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, called Taiwan “a perfect example of what we want all our allies to do,” as demanded by Trump. “They have consistently been one of the biggest buyers of U.S. weapons for its defense,” said McCaul, a Republican, who travelled to Taiwan last month to affirm the U.S. support for the island. Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, a Democrat, accused the former president of betraying Taiwan. “Former President Trump’s threat to abandon our nation’s longstanding, bipartisan commitments to Taiwan would mean betraying one of the world’s most vibrant democracies to the Chinese Communist Party,” said Krishnamoorthi, ranking member of the House Select Committee on China. “Failing to provide for Taiwan’s defense would not only be potentially illegal under the Taiwan Relations Act, it would be a betrayal of American values and our democratic institutions,” he added. Trump “did not say the U.S. won’t defend Taiwan,” said Miles Yu, who previously served in the Trump administration and is director of the China Center at the Hudson Institute, a Washington think tank. The former president said Taiwan should share more of the costs for such a collective defense, which is “far less of a problem” for Taiwan than for other U.S. allies in the region, he said. “The defense of Taiwan is enshrined in the Taiwan Relations Act,” Yu said. “The joint defense of Taiwan is a national consensus. To change that will be extremely difficult.” But, compared to Biden, Trump would place “utmost importance” on building credible deterrence over Taiwan, Yu said, adding Trump has said he would “bomb” Beijing if it should invade Taiwan.

Mr Biden, 81, was seen earlier on Wednesday visiting supporters in Las Vegas and speaking at an event. He has cancelled a campaign speech later in the night. The illness comes as he faces increasing pressure to step aside because of his age following a poor debate performance at the end of June. Ms Jean-Pierre said the president planned to isolate at his home in Delaware while he carries out “all of his duties fully during that time”. The president’s doctor, Kevin O’Connor, said Mr Biden presented with upper respiratory symptoms, including a runny nose and a cough and was given his first dose of Paxlovid. He felt fine during his first event of the day, but later tested positive Dr O’Connor said. Reporters on the Las Vegas trip said they were rushed to the city’s airport following the announcement. Mr Biden moved slowly and cautiously up the steps to the plane, video shows. He was not wearing a mask. As he boarded Air Force One he was heard to say: “Good, I feel good.” The president was forced to cancel a speech at UnidosUS, a Latino civil rights organisation.

In an interview with BET, which was due to be broadcast on Wednesday evening, Mr Biden said he did not feel he could pass the mantle with the country so “divided”. The president also said, for the first time, that he would consider dropping out of the race if any of his doctors said he had a “medical condition”.","summary":"Joe Biden has tested positive for Covid-19 and is suffering mild symptoms, the White House has said.

The president’s doctor said Biden has received his first dose of the antiviral drug Paxlovid, and will be self-isolating at his home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, in line with US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance. “I feel good,” Biden, who is fully vaccinated and boosted, told reporters in Las Vegas, flashing a thumbs-up before boarding Air Force One Wednesday.

CNN has reached out to the Biden campaign for comment. The president first tested positive for Covid-19 in July 2022 and suffered a second, so-called rebound case in the following days. Biden has received multiple Covid-19 vaccine booster shots, most recently in September 2023, according to a memo from his physician. During his first bout with the disease, he experienced mild symptoms, including runny nose, fatigue, high temperature and a cough and was treated with Paxlovid. Covid-19 levels across the country have risen in recent weeks, according to the CDC. The most recent data shows that during the week ending July 6, there was a 23.5% increase in emergency visits for Covid-19 compared with the previous week.

But cases of the virus are now surging, and health officials have reported spikes in emergency room visits and hospitalizations due to Covid.Donald Trump and his campaign see his running mate, JD Vance, as a way to expand Trump’s voter base, according to sources familiar with the matter, intending to lean into the senator’s previous criticisms of Trump to convince voters who dislike both 2024 candidates to back the former president.In the years before Vance ran for the US Senate, he repeatedly criticized Trump and his presidency in interviews where he made clear he never liked the former president and considered him “cultural heroin” and in private conversations where he suggested Trump was “America’s Hitler”.But the criticisms, which once angered Trump, are now being seen by the Trump campaign as a unique asset that could resonate with voters who could be in a similar position: people who have previously found Trump unsavory but might prefer him to Biden, the sources said.The Trump campaign has suggested that they want Vance to lean in to the fact that he was previously a so-called “Never Trumper”, with the hope that it could give independent and uncommitted voters a path towards supporting the former president in November.Trump sees former ‘Never Trumper’ JD Vance as a way to expand his base, insiders sayRead moreThe Biden/Harris campaign earlier released a statement chastising their rivals for backing away from a vice-presidential debate, linking it to Vance’s resurfaced comments endorsing an abortion ban.“Donald Trump is the one whose campaign said he would debate ‘anytime, anyplace; and who picked JD Vance specifically for his debating skills,” the campaign said in a statement. “Now suddenly right after a damning new leak showing his support for a nationwide abortion ban, Vance is backing off a debate against Vice President Harris, who has spent the last two years prosecuting the case on behalf of reproductive freedom.”The Trump campaign, meanwhile, has said they are hesitant to schedule the debate due to uncertainty over who will be the Democratic nominee for vice-president.Joe Biden is headed back to Delaware..⁦@POTUS⁩ is back on Air Force One and we’re headed to Delaware pic.twitter.com/SLGfL8pcN1— Nandita Bose (@nanditab1) July 17, 2024 Meanwhile at the Republican national convention, Paul Manafort, Trump’s 2016 campaign chair, has been spotted on the floor.Manafort was pardoned after being found guilty of several financial crimes in 2018, following an investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller and his team.Manafort, 69, was convicted on Tuesday of five counts of tax fraud, two counts of bank fraud and one count of failure to report a foreign bank account.Trump had signalled that he wanted to bring Manafort back in the fold for his latest campaign, but it is unclear whether he has been officially enlisted and, if so, in what capacity.The White House confirmed Joe Biden has been tested positive for Covid.According to the press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, the president is “vaccinated and boosted” and has mild symptoms.“The White House will provide regular updates on the President’s status as he continues to carry out the full duties of the office while in isolation,” she said in a statement to the press.The president’s doctor said that Biden “presented this afternoon with upper respiratory symptoms, to include rhinorhea (runny nose) and non-productive cough, with general malaise.He “felt okay for his first event of the day, but given that he was not feeling better, point of care testing for Covid-19 was conducted, and the results were positive”,” in a statement shared with media. “His symptoms remain mild, his respiratory rate is normal at 16, his temperature is normal at 97.8 and his pulse oximetry is normal at 97%.

Public calls for Biden to drop out appeared to subside in the immediate aftermath of the assassination attempt on the former president and as this week’s Republican National Convention commenced, but the movement against Biden has regained steam as behind-the-scenes lobbying against him persisted. Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), a prominent Democrat who was an impeachment manager against Trump and is running for the Senate seat of the late Sen. Dianne Feinstein, on Wednesday joined 18 of his House colleagues and Sen. Peter Welch (D-VT) by calling on Biden to pass the torch to a new nominee. “A second Trump presidency will undermine the very foundation of our democracy, and I have serious concerns about whether the president can defeat Donald Trump in November,” Schiff, former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement. “There is only one singular goal: defeating Donald Trump. The stakes are just too high.” Democratic leaders, including House Minority Leader Hakeem (D-NY) and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), reportedly helped fuel a pressure campaign to delay the Democratic National Committee’s plans to nominate Biden before next month’s party convention. Neither office responded to a request for comment from the Washington Examiner. Either way, the clock is ticking for Democrats. The DNC announced to committee members on Wednesday that it would not hold a virtual roll call to nominate Biden until August. An exact date is not set, but officials have said after Aug. 1 and before Aug. 7, the date of Ohio’s initial deadline to have Biden appear on the ticket. Ohio lawmakers have since extended the deadline, with many Democrats arguing that the roll call is no longer necessary. Democratic strategist Brad Bannon, who is president of ​​political polling and consulting firm Bannon Communications Research, told the Washington Examiner that he thinks there is a one-week time frame before two things happen: either Biden withdraws or Democrats “suck it up.” “Either the president needs to find a way to quell the Democratic dissent, and if he can’t do that in the next week, he should step aside,” Bannon said. “I think you could make a good argument for the president to step aside. But he isn’t going to step aside, so I think it’s incumbent on Democrats to suck it up and support the president.” Schiff became the first Democrat to call on Biden to withdraw from the race following the shooting at Trump’s Pennsylvania rally — and many strategists, including Bannon, argue that it sent a “shock wave” through the Democratic and Republican parties. “Because of the assassination attempt, I think that stopped everybody in their tracks,” Bannon said. “But I also do think previous to Saturday … the president and his campaign had pressed very hard to make it clear that he’s intent on running for reelection.” Eyes will be on Biden to see if he will take the concerns from the Democratic conference in stride and push forward as the nominee or if he will bow out and allow a new face to take his place. For now, he seems to be dealing in hypotheticals. The president said in an interview with BET’s Ed Gordon that he would consider dropping out if his medical staff diagnosed him with a new condition or disease that would make continuing his campaign impossible. “If I had some medical condition that emerged, if somebody, if doctors came to me and said, you got this problem and that problem,” the president said when Gordon asked if anything would make him change his mind about running. The medical condition is another “if” added to Biden’s list of potential reasons he’d step down: a sign from God, urging from his family, or if polls showed that he had no chance of winning. Following the debate on June 27, Biden found himself trailing Trump nationwide by 6 percentage points. Many swing districts and battleground states are paying the price for Biden at the top of the ticket, with several shifting further to favor Republicans. Polling has shown, however, that Biden is still within the margin of error to win a few of the states that have shifted into GOP territory. But a new poll released Wednesday showing that a majority of voters want Biden to drop out of the race is likely to put increased pressure on congressional Democrats to decide if they support the president or think it’s time to move on to someone new. Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE), a Biden-Harris campaign co-chair, said in an interview with MSNBC on Wednesday that he would remind his concerned colleagues there are several months to go before the November election. “Poll after poll, nationwide head-to-head polls, still show this within the margin of error in a head-to-head race and bluntly, it’s July,” Coons said. “There are months left. I don’t know of any candidate for president in modern history who, because the polls are moving one way or the other by a few points, abandon their campaign for the presidency in July.” Both Bannon and Hank Sheinkopf, Democratic strategist and former adviser to President Bill Clinton and New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg, said the Democratic Party is “torn” right now on how to approach the issue of Biden as the nominee. Concerns over Biden’s viability to serve another term in the White House have been steadily growing over the months after the president tripped or fell down at events, messed up people’s names, and made repeated verbal gaffes. The president’s lackluster debate performance, in which he stammered and stumbled over words, only added fuel to the fire. Initially, Biden’s allies attempted to brush off his display as one bad night compared to years of his administration’s record. However, in the days following the debate, he misspoke while introducing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as “President Putin” before correcting himself. During a press conference following the NATO summit, Biden referred to Vice President Kamala Harris as “Vice President Trump.” Biden has repeatedly said he will run for reelection and remain in the race despite some Democrats still stating that it is “his decision,” insinuating that the choice is not finalized. Sheinkopf said that for Biden to change his decision now, “the pressure against him would have to be immense, and it’s nowhere near that now, not publicly.” A new polling memo from BlueLabs Analytics released Wednesday could incentivize Democrats to join the chorus of their 20 colleagues in calling him to step aside. The memo found nearly every other Democrat tested performed better than Biden in a matchup with Trump. It found the strongest candidates were Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ) and Govs. Wes Moore (D-MD), Josh Shapiro (D-PA), and Gretchen Whitmer (D-MI), all of whom polled above Biden “by roughly 5 points across battleground states.” Bannon thinks most Democrats are waiting to see what happens in the coming days before deciding to join their colleagues or accept the president as their nominee. “Every day that we cross off the calendar strengthens Biden’s support with Democrats,” Bannon said. “It’s pretty clear that, I think, a lot of Democrats think that Biden’s nomination, renomination, is inevitable,” the strategist added. “Why jump out in front of a rolling freight train, because everything I see is that Joe Biden is going to be the nominee unless he chooses not to be.”","summary":"President Joe Biden is facing a renewed wave of anxiety among Democrats over his ability to take on GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump.&#160; Public calls for Biden to drop out appeared to subside in the immediate aftermath of the assassination attempt on the former president and as this week’s Republican National Convention commenced, but the [&#8230;]","url":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/congressional/3087833/biden-democratic-groundswell-turn-against-him-allies-look-run-out-clock/","image":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/joe-biden-2.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-17 23:08:42","author":"Rachel Schilke and Ramsey Touchberry","authors":["Rachel Schilke and Ramsey Touchberry"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.179},{"id":252024640,"title":"Biden said he might leave race 'if I had some medical condition that emerged'","text":"President Joe Biden said in an interview airing on Wednesday that, should his doctors tell him he had a \"medical condition,\" he would consider dropping out of the presidential race, his latest explanation of what might cause him to step aside as a growing number of Democrats pressured him to do so. \"If there had [muffled] some medical condition that emerged, if somebody, if the doctors, came to me, said, 'you got this problem and that problem.' But I made a serious mistake in the whole debate, \" he told BET's Ed Gordon n a preview clip of the interview set to air at 10 p.m. ET The interview was done before the White House announced late Wednesday that Biden had tested positive for COVID-19, saying that his symptoms were mild. Biden has now given several shifting reasons about what might make him decide to leave the race. He told ABC News in a July 5 interview after his poor debate performance debate that only the \"Lord Almighty\" might get him to drop out. When ABC's George Stephanopoulos asked, \"If you can be convinced that you cannot defeat Donald Trump, will you stand down?\" Biden answered, \"Well, it depends on .. on if the Lord Almighty comes down and tells me that, I might do that.\" In a news conference a week ago, he said he would stay in the race unless his aides told him he had no chance to win a second term. \"No, unless they came back and said, 'There’s no way you can win.' \"No one is saying that. No poll says that,\" Biden told reporters. Also in the BET interview, Biden said, \"When I originally ran, I said I was gonna be a transitional candidate, and I thought that I'd be able to move from this just pass it on to someone else. But I didn't anticipate things getting so, so, so divided and quite frankly, and I think the only thing age brings a little bit of wisdom,\" he said. \"And I think I've demonstrated that I know how to get things done for the country, in spite of the fact that we [were] told we couldn't get it done. But there's more to do, and I'm reluctant to walk away from that.\" On Tuesday, he wholeheartedly endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as not only a \"great vice president\" but so great that \"she could be president of the United States,\" he said while addressing the NAACP national convention in Las Vegas.","summary":"His latest in shifting reasons came before the White House said he had COVID-19.","url":"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-leave-race-medical-condition-emerged/story?id=112042367","image":"https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/36db876c-068d-4c73-9138-1695f02e383c/Biden-shifting-reason-1-gty-jm-240717_1721253561313_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-17 23:06:39","author":"Fritz Farrow,Gabriella Abdul-Hakim,Will McDuffie","authors":["Fritz Farrow","Gabriella Abdul-Hakim","Will McDuffie"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.598},{"id":252023672,"title":"Biden tests positive for Covid-19","text":"Washington, July 18 (IANS) US President Joe Biden has tested positive for Covid-19 following his first event in Las Vegas, the White House said on Wednesday.

The actress, 49, wants him to 'end the fighting,' after he sued her for selling her half of the winery in October 2021 for $67 million, according to People magazine. Angelina asked that Brad, 60, disclose any third-party communication he had after their private plane ride in 2016 - during which she said he allegedly became violent and abusive, which he has vehemently denied and was cleared of - leading to the demise of their marriage. During the plane ride, it was alleged that he had an argument with son Maddox - and the FBI investigated the matter and cleared Brad of any wrongdoing. Brad's lawyer said her request was 'intrusive' and a 'sensationalist fishing expedition,' per the outlet. Angelina Jolie wants ex-husband Brad Pitt to drop his lawsuit against her regarding the center of their legal drama - Chateau Miraval winery - via her lawyer Paul Murphy Read More Angelina Jolie wants ex husband Brad Pitt to 'end the fighting' by dropping lawsuit against her for selling her stake of their winery - amid eight years long divorce His lawyer asked the judge to deny it. In February 2022, Brad sued Angelina for selling their Chateau Miraval Winery, their French winery and the place they tied the knot. They had 50/50 ownership, and Angelina sold her portion to Russian oligarch Yuri Shefler. The holding company in control of her Miraval share is called Nouvel. He requested the sale to be voided and sought monetary damages and legal fees however the sale went through on October 5, 2021. In June 2023, Brad filed an amended complaint regarding her sale of her share of the winery. His lawsuit for the sale of her portion of the winery is still ongoing. Brad claims that Angelina went against their verbal agreement about their winery, but she claims that didn't let him buy her out because she didn't want sign his NDA - which was part of the deal, according to People. Her lawyer, Paul Murphy, claims that Brad 'tried to punish and control Angelina by demanding a newly expanded NDA to cover his personal misconduct and abuse.' per the outlet. 'Those actions are central to the proceedings. We are not at all surprised Mr. Pitt is afraid to turn over the documents demonstrating these facts,' Murphy said. 'When Angelina again asks Mr. Pitt to end the fighting and finally put their family on a clear path toward healing, unless Mr. Pitt withdraws his lawsuit, Angelina has no choice but to obtain the evidence necessary to prove his allegations wrong,' Murphy said in the paperwork, per People. The movie stars, who met in 2004 while filming Mr. And Mrs. Smith, share six children together: sons Maddox, 22, Pax, 20, and Knox, 16, and daughters Zahara, 19, Shiloh, 18, and Vivienne, 16. Jolie adopted Maddox in 2002, then Zahara in 2005, a year after she'd met Pitt while the pair filmed Mr and Mrs Smith. He was married to Jennifer Aniston at the time. They then adopted Pax together in 2007, and had biological kids Shiloh, Knox and Vivienne afterwards. Pitt adopted all of the kids before they got married in 2014. They married in August 2014 after 10 years together but Angelina filed for divorce in September 2016. The actress, 49, wants him to 'end the fighting,' after he sued her for selling her half of the winery in October 2021 for $67 million, according to People magazine; seen in happier times - November 2015 Brad, 60, and Angelina, 48, reportedly disclosed their finances to the other party, according to TMZ , which signals the end of a divorce settlement; Brad and Angelina pictured snuggling up January 7, 2008 at the 13th Annual Critics' Choice Awards in Santa Monica At the time, Angelina chose to file 'for the health of the family,' according to the Associated Press, and asked for physical custody of the children. Jolie filed for sole custody after filing for divorce following the alleged incident on the couple's private plane. By the end of September 2016, she was granted the full physical custody according to a judge, with Brad having visitation rights. Two months later, Brad filed his response, requesting joint and physical custody of the children. By December 2016, Brad filed - but was later denied - a request to seal the custody related documents. In January 2017, they released a joint statement revealing that they signed an agreement to keep their court documents confidential. The judge ordered Angelina to help repair Brad's relationship with their children and he was given more time with them. However, in August 2018, Angelina accused Brad of not paying any 'meaningful child support, with Brad's lawyers filing a response one day later, claiming he's paid her $9 million since their split. A judge granted them both legal single status on April 12, 2019, while the couple continued to finalize their divorce. Brad was granted joint custody by private Judge John Ouderkirk in May 2021 but Angelina challenged it. A California appeals court disqualified the judge in July 2021, agreeing with Jolie in that the judge, Judge John Ouderkirk, did not sufficiently disclose business relationships with Pitt's attorneys. Lawyers for the star filed a petition for review with the California Supreme Court after the disqualification of Judge John Ouderkirk effectively voided the joint custody ruling, according to People. In Pitt's petition, lawyers claim that elimination of Ouderkirk 'effectively upended the constitutionally authorized temporary judging system in California' and subsequently 'throws open the door to disqualification challenges at any point during a case, even if the party raising the motion has long been on notice about the alleged grounds for disqualification.' The movie stars, who met in 2004 while filming Mr. And Mrs. Smith, share six children together: sons Maddox, 22, Pax, 20, and Knox, 15, and daughters Zahara, 19, Shiloh, 17, and Vivienne, 15; seen November 8, 2011 in Tokyo In addition, lawyers for the actor allege that Jolie was 'made aware of Judge Ouderkirk's significant professional history with Pitt's counsel from the very start,' yet did not seek disqualification until years later. The joint custody ruling was then vacated after his removal. Brad is currently romantically involved with Ines de Ramon, the ex-wife of actor Paul Wesley.

According to state election law, the ballot for the general election hasn’t been set yet, which means Biden’s name on it is not yet set in stone. He’ll have to receive his party’s nomination in order for that to happen. Political parties qualified to participate in the election in California have until Thursday, Aug. 22 — more than a month out from now — to submit their nominees to the state secretary of state. That’s the final day of the Democratic National Convention where the party will name its presidential nominee. Once nominees are submitted, candidates will be certified on Thursday, Aug. 29, which also marks the deadline for the secretary of state to notify each county elections official of the list of every candidate for public office who is “entitled to receive votes within the county,” per the state’s election calendar. That’s the final list of names that will be printed on the ballots, which must go out to military and overseas voters between 45 to 60 days before an election, according to the secretary of state, and no later than Oct. 7 for all other active registered voters. But a candidate could, theoretically, bow out after they’re certified to go on the ballot and after ballots have been printed with their name on them. When asked what would happen in that situation, the secretary of state’s office deferred to a previous statement: Candidates certified on Aug. 29 will appear on the general election ballot. Richard Hasen, a professor at UCLA School of Law and the director of the Safeguarding Democracy Project, said late changes to ballots could be a legal issue. “It gets much dicier once the nomination has been transmitted and there’s the potential for litigation to try to make a change,” he said. Questions about what could happen to states’ ballots cropped up after politicians, high-dollar donors and influential celebrities called for Biden to step aside following his poor debate performance in June. So far, close to two dozen congressional Democrats have publicly called for Biden to step aside, and this week, several Democrats expressed support of a letter addressed to DNC members asking them to “cancel any plans” to virtually nominate Biden before the convention. On Wednesday, Rep. Adam Schiff became one of the most prominent Democrats in Congress to publicly call for Biden to pass the torch. He has “serious concerns about whether the president can defeat Donald Trump in November,” Schiff, D-Burbank, said in a statement. Other Democratic lawmakers from Southern California have also said that Biden should exit the race, including Reps. Mike Levin, D-San Juan Capistrano; and Scott Peters, D-San Diego. Rep. Mark Takano, D-Riverside, has reportedly expressed this privately.","summary":"The secretary of state says candidates will be certified for the ballot in late August.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2024/07/17/how-candidates-get-on-or-off-californias-nov-5-ballot/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AP24194024263346-1.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-17 23:02:12","author":"Hanna Kang","authors":["Hanna Kang"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.41},{"id":252023232,"title":"Joe Biden contracts Covid-19 after stating he would withdraw from the presidential race if found to have a ‘medical condition’.","text":"President Joe Biden, aged 81, has been confirmed to have Covid-19 shortly after expressing that he would only reconsider withdrawing from the presidential campaign if he faced a medical issue hindering his participation. Biden was noticeably late for his appearance at the annual UnidosUS conference in Las Vegas, Nevada, on Wednesday. It was later revealed by the organization that the delay was due to his positive Covid-19 test. Janet Murguía, the CEO of UnidosUs took the podium in his absence and announced that he wouldn’t be speaking as he was just diagnosed with the virus. UnidosUs is a Latino civil rights organization in the battleground state of Nevada. During the conference, Janet Murguía informed attendees that President Biden, whom she had spoken to on the phone, was deeply upset about missing the event after testing positive for Covid-19. She noted his recent attendance at numerous events, emphasizing the situation. “We appreciate very much his wanting to be here – I had a great introduction reminding us of all the actions he’s taken for our community,” she told the audience. The White House later released a statement confirming the president’s diagnosis. “Earlier today following his first event in Las Vegas, President Biden tested positive for COVID-19. He is vaccinated and boosted and he is experiencing mild symptoms,” the statement from Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre read. “He will be returning to Delaware where he will self-isolate and will continue to carry out all of his duties fully during that time. “The White House will provide regular updates on the President’s status as he continues to carry out the full duties of the office while in isolation.” The statement included a note from Biden’s doctor which explained that he was experiencing upper respiratory symptoms this afternoon including a runny nose, cough, and mucous. Biden attended an earlier event on Wednesday where he was pictured greeting supporters in a restaurant. His doctor said he felt okay at the start of the day, but after the symptoms did not disappear, the president was advised to take a test for Covid-19. His doctor added that Biden would continue to self-isolate with CDEC guidance. Biden’s respiratory rate and temperature remain normal. He has received a dose of Paxlovid. Paxlovid is a popular medication used to treat mild to moderate Covid-19 symptoms. After the news broke, Biden was seen boarding Air Force One as reporters shouted questions at him. He told reporters that he was feeling “good,” and gave them a thumbs up as he walked from his car to the plane. CAMPAIGN TRAIL INTERRUPTION The news comes as the president has been traveling for speaking engagements as part of his re-election campaign. Biden sat down with BET News this week for an interview, revealing that he would re-evaluate his decision to run for re-election if he had a medical issue. When asked what it would take to re-consider his run, Biden responded, “If I had some medical condition that emerged.” Biden then clarified, “If doctors came to me and said, ‘You got this problem, that problem.’” The comments come as Biden has stood firm on his decision to continue the campaign. During an interview with George Stephanopoulos, he said that only the “Lord Almighty” could convince him to drop out.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nPresident Joe Biden, aged 81, has been confirmed to have Covid-19 shortly&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Joe Biden contracts Covid-19 after stating he would withdraw from the presidential race if found to have a &#8216;medical condition&#8217;. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/joe-biden-contracts-covid-19-after-stating-he-would-withdraw-from-the-presidential-race-if-found-to-have-a-medical-condition/","image":"https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/07/BLU_A96630864_President-Joe-Biden-Delivers-Animated-First-Public-Speech-Days-After-Trump-Assassinati.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-17 23:02:10","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.467},{"id":252025640,"title":"Trump Campaign Refuses to Schedule VP Debate: 'Don't Know Who' the Democrat VP Nominee Will Be","text":"The Trump campaign stated it would not schedule a vice presidential debate before the Democratic National Convention (DNC) takes place, citing uncertainty over who the Democrat Party’s vice presidential nominee will be.

A tragic assassination attempt against a presidential candidate and the death and injury of fellow Americans are explainable but not justifiable. Toxic rhetoric — lies, unfounded accusations, disrespect for candidates and their offices, threats directed at elected officials and their families, attacks on our democratic institutions — has been normalized. Tolerance of toxic speech by political leaders, party insiders, the media, ourselves — those who should be guardians of civil and truthful political discourse — has poisoned our air. Enough. Our democracy depends on civil, factual discourse leading to free and fair elections. Our democracy depends on recognizing that political opponents are also fellow Americans with a love of country. Winners or losers, we all must insist on the peaceful transition of power and close ranks behind the chosen leaders. Injecting violence by deed — or word — into our election process threatens our democracy. Violence must not be advocated for, resorted to or tolerated. Carol Kuiper Los Altos Trump attack is fallout from his heated speech Re: “A bloodied Trump is safe after assassination attempt” (Page A1, July 14). In the aftermath of the attempted assassination of Donald Trump, once again the Republicans have taken the low road. Instead of asking for calm and unity in a time of crisis, they spout conspiracy theories, blame the left, and even President Biden personally. Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, to name a few, are adding fuel to the fire that has been fomented by Trump for eight years. Trump himself, after the attempt, raised his hand and shouted, “Fight! Fight!” He has promoted violence against the “other” since Day 1, inciting his followers with words like “scum,” “vermin,” “animals” and “enemies.” He praised body-slamming, called police thugs, and mimics and name-calls his critics, and yet still attracts loyalists. He has undermined the moral fabric of this country. I, like Biden, decry violence, but how can one not see that Trump has been inciting it all along? Claudia Parker San Jose At rally shooting, we reap what we sow Re: “A bloodied Trump is safe after assassination attempt” (Page A1, July 14). Inevitably the right will now blame liberals, Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi, et al, for the horrific assassination attempt Saturday, but as we’re learning, the GOP has perfected the art of projection. For the past eight years, Donald Trump has used the rhetoric of violence to excite and unite his base. All of this aggressive talk climaxed with the violent assault on the Capitol, but beyond that, we’ve had the attack on Pelosi’s husband, the kidnapping attempt of Michigan Gov. Whitmer, and myriad death threats against jurors, judges, prosecutors, even election volunteers who would not bend the knee to Trump’s wishes. So blame Biden or liberals if you want, but like my mom always said, “You reap what you sow.” Bob Parker San Jose Both sides must moderate their speech Re: “A bloodied Trump is safe after assassination attempt” (Page A1, July 14). Democrat politicians have been saying Donald Trump and Republicans are an existential threat to our Democracy. Some compare Trump to Hitler, which just gave license to an emotionally disturbed person to shoot at him and kill and injure other bystanders. Who wouldn’t kill Hitler if they had the chance? Political speech has grown far more hate-driven since 2017 when a shooter fired on Republican members of Congress playing baseball. It’s time politicians from both parties pulled back on their political hate speech and that the news media stops amplifying it lest we really do lose our democracy.

Press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Biden will fly to his home in Delaware, where he will ''self-isolate and will continue to carry out all of his duties fully during that time.\" The news had first been shared by Unidos US President and CEO Janet Murguía, who told guests at the group's convention in Las Vegas that president had sent his regrets and could not appear because he tested positive for the virus. Dr. Kevin O'Connor, the president's physician, said in a note that Biden ''presented this afternoon with upper respiratory symptoms, to include rhinorhea (runny nose) and non-productive cough, with general malaise.'' After the positive COVID-19 test, Biden was prescribed the antiviral drug Paxlovid and has taken his first dose, O'Connor said. Biden was slated to speak at the Unidos event in Las Vegas Wednesday afternoon as part of an effort to rally Hispanic voters ahead of the November election. Instead, he departed for the airport to fly to Delaware, where he had already been planning to spend a long weekend at his home in Rehoboth Beach. Biden gingerly boarded Air Force One and told reporters traveling with him, ''I feel good.'' The president was not wearing a mask as he walked onto Air Force One. The president had previously been at the Original Lindo Michoacan restaurant in Las Vegas, where he was greeting diners and sat for an interview with Univision. Biden has been vaccinated and is current on his recommended annual booster dose for COVID-19. The vaccines have proven highly effective at limiting serious illness and death from the virus, which killed more than 1 million people in the U.S. since the pandemic began in 2020. Paxlovid has been proven to curtail the chances of serious illness and death from COVID-19 when prescribed in the early days of an infection, but has also been associated with rebound infections, where the virus comes back a few days after clearing up. Biden last tested positive for COVID-19 twice in the summer of 2022, when he had a primary case and a rebound case of the virus. Health officials have reported recent upticks in emergency room visits and hospitalizations from COVID-19. There has also been a pronounced increase in positive test results in much of the country — particularly the southwestern U.S. — Associated Press writers Josh Boak, Stephanie Nano and Zeke Miller contributed.","summary":"President Joe Biden tested positive for COVID-19 while traveling Wednesday in Las Vegas and is experiencing ''mild symptoms'' including ''general malaise'' from the infection, the White House said.","url":"https://www.startribune.com/president-joe-biden-tests-positive-for-covid-19-while-campaigning-in-las-vegas/600381484/","image":"https://arc.stimg.co/startribunemedia/R4IHVURDYFCDXO6G5CM7FJ5ZFQ.JPG?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-17 22:59:11","author":"Aamer Madhani","authors":["Aamer Madhani"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.196},{"id":252023234,"title":"President Joe Biden tests positive for COVID-19 after attending a campaign event in Las Vegas and returns to Delaware for self-isolation","text":"President Joe Biden has tested positive for COVID-19 and is experiencing mild symptoms, according to the White House.

Jason Crow’s tense exchange with President Joe Biden during a weekend call with Democratic lawmakers has attracted attention this week as Biden resists calls to drop out of the presidential race. Media reports Tuesday and Wednesday confirmed details of the dialog, which included the president at one point invoking his deceased son’s Bronze Star in a comment to Crow, a veteran who also has been awarded the same medal. The call occurred before the Colorado congressman on Sunday warned publicly of a “high risk” the president would lose the upcoming election. Crow, an Aurora Democrat, was part of the Saturday Zoom call with Biden and fellow moderate Democrats when the argument happened, according to the online news outlet Puck, which described Biden as “chastising” Crow in a recording of the video call. It took place about an hour before a gunman attempted to assassinate former President Donald Trump at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, an event that has dominated the news since then. In the Zoom call, Crow, a former Army Ranger who won a Bronze Star for actions during combat in the Iraq War, asked Biden about voters’ national security concerns. Biden called him “dead wrong on national security” and cited accomplishments that included bolstering alliances in the Pacific and the European defense compact NATO. “Name me a foreign leader who thinks I’m not the most effective leader in the world on foreign policy,” Biden told Crow, according to Puck’s report. “Tell me! Tell me who the hell that is! Tell me who put NATO back together! Tell me who enlarged NATO, tell me who did the Pacific basin! “Tell me who did something that you’ve never done with your Bronze Star like my son — and I’m proud of your leadership, but guess what, what’s happening, we’ve got Korea and Japan working together, I put (the trilateral Pacific security pact) AUKUS together, anyway! … Things are in chaos, and I’m bringing some order to it. And again, find me a world leader who’s an ally of ours who doesn’t think I’m the most respected person they’ve ever –” Crow interjected: “It’s not breaking through, Mr. President,” he said, “to our voters.” Biden’s eldest son, Beau Biden, also served in the Army and won a Bronze Star during the Iraq War. He died in 2016 of brain cancer, which the president has attributed to his time in the service. That Saturday exchange ended with Biden telling those on the call he needed to leave for Mass. Crow’s office declined to comment on the report, which is the latest to reveal internal strife among Democrats in the weeks since Biden performed poorly in a June 27 debate with Trump. On Sunday, Crow joined a growing number of Democrats who have publicly raised the alarm about Biden’s reelection prospects, though he did not explicitly call for Biden to withdraw from the race. Speaking on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” Crow said he had a “robust call” with Biden but pushed back on the idea it was a sign of disunity in the party. Crow called Biden “one of the most effective national security and foreign policy presidents in generations” and said he’s been one of Biden’s “fiercest advocates.” But that message is not breaking through to voters, Crow said. “I do believe right now, if — unless there’s a major change — that there is a high risk that we lose this election,” Crow said. “In reading the tea leaves, it’s very troubling for many of us right now,” he said, after citing other moderate colleagues who won tough races in 2018. “So, we want to see a change. And that’s what the questions that we’re asking are about.” Fellow Colorado U.S. Rep. Brittany Pettersen on Friday called on Biden to “please pass the torch” and end his reelection campaign. U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet, like Crow, has suggested Biden is likely to lose the election. But U.S. Rep. Diana DeGette, the state’s longest-serving member of Congress, has staunchly defended Biden.

Richard Goldinger – the district attorney in Butler County, Pennsylvania, where Saturday’s campaign rally was held – said the Secret Service “was informed that the local police department did not have manpower to assist with securing that building,” the Washington Post reports. A Secret Service official confirmed Goldinger’s account and said that positioning an officer and patrol car outside the building was part of the agency’s plan to secure the structure, the Washington Post reported. Despite the failure, Crooks still managed to get on top of the building, which gave him a clear line of sight on Trump just 130 yards away. Embattled Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle previously told ABC News that the agency decided not to guard the roof because it was too slanted and posed a safety issue for a law enforcement sniper team. The Secret Service and local police remain under fire over the lapse in security that allowed Crooks to get a clear shot at Trump. The mounting pressure against the agencies comes following a flood of reports that Crooks had been sought after by officers at the rally for about 30 minutes before the shooting, with one local cop coming face-to-face with the gunman just moments before he opened fire on the former president. Both agencies have pointed the finger at each other over the shooting, with the Secret Service claiming it was up to local police to guard the outer perimeter of the rally where Crooks fired from. The Department of Homeland Security’s inspector general has opened a formal investigation into the Secret Service’s handling of Trump’s protection on the day of the shooting. It came following President Joe Biden’s call to launch an independent review of the security at the rally, with top Republican officials calling on Cheatle to resign over the apparent security failings.","summary":"Local police warned the Secret Service ahead of time that they did not have the manpower to secure the building where Thomas Matthew Crooks shot and injured Donald Trump, law enforcement officials said.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/07/17/us-news/local-cops-told-secret-service-they-could-not-patrol-building-used-by-trump-rally-shooter-report/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/inspectors-search-roof-thomas-matthew-85601964.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/ZTOPu7FP-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-17 22:57:38","author":"Ronny Reyes","authors":["Ronny Reyes"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.706},{"id":252024474,"title":"Vulnerable Senate Democrat cites busy schedule for missing Biden’s Las Vegas stops","text":"Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) was absent from a string of campaign events by President Joe Biden on Tuesday and Wednesday during his two-day stop in the battleground state of Nevada. The lack of attendance from Rosen, who faces her own reelection battle in a toss-up race, came as other Senate Democrats and candidates in swing states have steered clear of the president amid heightened anxieties he’ll lose to former President Donald Trump. Rosen’s campaign told the Washington Examiner she missed Biden’s events both days in Las Vegas due to prior commitments. “Senator Rosen has pre-planned events and commitments in Reno this week,” a campaign spokesperson told the Washington Examiner. “Her focus will always be on showing up across Nevada and fighting to deliver for hardworking families.” Rosen has previously appeared with the president at the White House and on the campaign trail in her home state but has more recently put Biden at arm’s length, particularly after his weak debate performance last month that sparked panic among Democrats. Rosen is facing Army veteran Sam Brown, a Republican, in one of the country’s most competitive Senate contests that could determine control of the chamber. She appeared with Vice President Kamala Harris at a Biden campaign rally in Las Vegas one day after the debate on June 28, but it was not attended by the president. On June 18, Rosen was at the White House for an executive order announcement from Biden involving immigration but did not stand onstage behind the president within the camera shot with a chorus of other Democrats, including Sen. Cortez Masto (D-NV) and Reno Mayor Hillary Schieve. Rosen also spoke at a Biden Las Vegas rally in February. She and other vulnerable Senate Democrats have largely sidestepped questions about Biden’s mental fitness and whether he should drop out of the race. Rosen has told reporters she’s focusing on her own race and to focus on the accomplishments of Biden’s first term in office. Biden’s campaign events in Las Vegas this week featured Tuesday remarks at the 115th NAACP National Convention and an economic summit with Rep. Steven Horsford (D-NV). Biden declined to make public remarks mentioning Rosen at either of Tuesday’s events. Biden was forced to cancel a previously scheduled UnidosUS speech Wednesday as attendees waited for him to take the stage due to testing positive for COVID-19.","summary":"Sen.

The president is returning home to Delaware, where he \"will self-isolate and will continue to carry out all of his duties fully during that time,\" press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. \"The White House will provide regular updates on the president's status as he continues to carry out the full duties of the office while in isolation,\" Jean-Pierre said in a statement, which also included a note from Biden's doctor. The doctor's message said Biden displayed upper respiratory symptoms Wednesday afternoon, including a runny nose and cough. The message said Biden \"felt OK for his first event of the day, but given that he was not feeling better, point of care testing for COVID-19 was conducted, and the results were positive for the COVID-19 virus.\" The note said the president's respiratory rate, temperature and pulse was normal, and it said Biden already has received his first dose of Paxlovid. Biden will self-isolate at his home in Rehoboth, Del., officials said. Wednesday's health announcement about the president comes as Biden faces mounting calls within his own political party to demonstrate a physical vitality needed to defeat former President Donald Trump at the ballot box this November.","summary":"President Joe Biden has tested positive for COVID-19 and has mild symptoms, White House officials said Wednesday afternoon.","url":"https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2024/07/17/president-joe-biden-covid-19-2024/7091721256360/","image":"https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/7091721256360/2024/upi/565f6af92c52e213c77cb877262b2734/v1.2/President-Joe-Biden-to-self-isolate-at-home-after-showing-COVID-19-symptoms.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-17 22:53:26","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.005}]}
