The 81-year-old president was isolating with COVID in his $3.4 million home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, when he and his shrinking inner circle composed a letter saying it was time to step aside. Donors had pulled millions of dollars in funds, the list of Democrats telling him to drop out was growing by the day, and polls suggested that his chances of beating Donald Trump were dwindling after his disastrous debate performance. Jill Biden was there when her husband made the historic call, giving into mounting pressure. The question now is what pushed him to finally make the extraordinary move that blindsided some of his White House staff and most of the people working on his re-election campaign. On Saturday evening, Biden summoned to his side two men who have been there since his political start: advisers Steve Ricchetti and Mike Donilon. They have been with him through the best of times – his first years as a senator – to the worst of times – the death of his son Beau Biden. Already with the president and the first lady were their closest aides Annie Tomasini and Anthony Bernal, who they refer to as ‘family.’ Biden asked Ricchetti and Donilon to start drafting a letter and begin the process of how to make a public announcement, DailyMail.com confirmed. And the president also told his family. It suggests that Biden ultimately weighed the evidence against him and made the call that he couldn’t move forward for the good of the party. He had insisted that he would only step aside if he was shown polling that proved Kamala Harris would fare better than him against Trump in the general election, or if he developed a ‘medical condition.’ Was he given statistics showing he was doomed in November? Did he decide he wasn’t healthy enough to serve another four years? Or did he make a selfless decision based on the good of the future of the party? At 1:45 pm on Sunday, Biden, still at the beach house in Delaware, began calling his senior staff at the White House and the campaign. He had already spoken with Vice President Kamala Harris and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. In each conversation, he dropped his bombshell: He was exiting the presidential race. At 1:46 pm, his campaign account posted a letter from the president announcing his decision even as he was still on the staff call. Most of his staff – both in the White House and at the campaign – were shocked. They learned the news online, getting the alert when the @JoeBiden account posted the president’s missive. ‘No one had a heads up before the tweet posted,’ a campaign staffer told DailyMail.com. ‘Which, to me, is an insane way to treat the 1300 people that work for you on the campaign.’ It capped a chaotic 48 hours for the Biden family as they hunkered in behind their patriarch with a small, inner circle of longtime aides supporting them. Some were even reporting back to Jill Biden about those staffers deemed disloyal. Meanwhile, Biden had veered from angry at the pressure from his party to acceptance of the situation. And once his final decision was made on Saturday night, the rest moved quickly. Biden called Harris directly to tell her the news. He also had one-on-one calls with White House chief of staff Jeff Zients and campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon, according to reports. He would also speak with his Cabinet, Members of Congress, governors, and supporters. But it all happened so fast many staff were hurt about the way they learned of the news, although they weren’t surprised by it. The writing has been on the wall. Almost 40 Democratic lawmakers had called on Biden to exit the race. Major donors were threatening to pull their support. Actor George Clooney wrote an op-ed in the New York Times calling on Biden to step down. And Barack Obama was reportedly working behind the scenes to get Biden to move aside. It ‘needed to happen,’ a Democratic aide said. ‘But he kinda just dropped a bomb. Like it’s not surprising but it’s shocking.’ Another staffer said people were feeling ‘a mix of relief, gratefulness, hope.’ The campaign held an all-hands on deck call at 5 pm ET to reassure staff they still had their jobs. Campaign Chair Jen O’Malley Dillon acknowledged that it was ‘hard for staff who may have gotten the news while they were working or door knocking, but it was important for the president to hear from him in his own words.’ Publicly, aides have been loyal to Biden. Many have gone on TV and taken to social media to defend the president since his disastrous debate performance against Donald Trump 24 days ago, arguing Biden was the party’s nominee and planned to stay the nominee. Since the June 26th debate, staff had been trying to go about business as usual, pushing back at reports Biden would drop out. ‘Fanfiction’ declared deputy press secretary Andrew Bates said of reports Biden would drop out this weekend, advising Democrats to ‘keep the faith.’ Even on Sunday morning, the message from the campaign was Biden was in it to win it. Campaign co-chairman Cedric Richmond, said on CBS Face the Nation on Sunday morning: ‘I want to be crystal clear. He’s made a decision and that decision is to accept the nomination and run for reelection, win reelection.’ Officials defended the manner in which the decision was announced. It was made at the ‘last minute,’ a White House official said. It was actually made in the last 24 hours, with only Biden’s family and a small circle of close aides knowing of his decision. And by withholding it from senior staff until the last minute – and not telling junior staff at all – the news didn’t leak. It came out on Biden’s terms. It all fits with a man said to be frustrated at what he saw as a public pressure campaign to force his hand. Biden has spent the past four days being isolated both physically and politically. He is at the beach house in Delaware, on the Atlantic Ocean as he recovers from COVID, still coughing and hoarse from the virus. First lady Jill Biden has been with him, although staying in a separate room. And, it has been from there the president has watched Democrat after Democrat call for his exit even as he spent the past three weeks trying to reassure the party he was mentally and physically up to a second term. But, despite everything he’s done – national TV interviews, local radio interviews, a press conference, and campaign stops – nothing had quelled the tide against him. In the aftermath of the decision, Biden’s family was loud and clear in their love and support, praising him for his service to the country. Jill Biden sent him her love on Sunday afternoon, retweeting his letter with two red hearts. Naomi Biden, the Bidens’ eldest granddaughter, wrote a long post on X, where she said she was ‘proud’ of her ‘pop,’ which is what the grandchildren call President Biden. She noted: ‘Our world is better today in so many ways thanks to him. To the Americans who have always had his back, keep the faith. He will always have ours.’ And Hunter Biden said in a statement of his father: ‘He is unique in public life today, in that there is no distance between Joe Biden the man and Joe Biden the public servant of the last 54 years. I’m so lucky every night I get to tell him I love him, and to thank him. I ask all Americans to join me tonight in doing the same. Thank you, Mr. President. I love you, Dad.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nFollowing weeks of crisis talks and a growing tidal wave of Democrats&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: The surprising decision that led Biden to step down: An inside look at the unexpected moment and key players involved first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/the-surprising-decision-that-led-biden-to-step-down-an-inside-look-at-the-unexpected-moment-and-key-players-involved/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/07/21/23/87599581-13657081-image-a-18_1721601335491.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-22 00:27:13","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.289},{"id":252300698,"title":"Manchin weighs options after Biden exits presidential race","text":"Sen.

Rep. John Garamendi, D-Calif., tells “NewsNation Prime” that Biden’s endorsement of his running mate, Vice President Kamala Harris, has “slammed the door” for other Democratic hopefuls like California Gov. Gavin Newsom. Newsom has already endorsed Harris, calling her “tough,” “fearless” and “tenacious” in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter. “With our democracy at stake and our future on the line, no one is better to prosecute the case against Donald Trump’s dark vision and guide our country in a healthier direction than America’s Vice President,” the post read in part. Though plenty of politicians want a seat in the Oval Office, Garamendi explained they will just have to wait until the next election cycle to get a shot. “He’ll be back on the field as a presidential candidate,” Garamendi said. “But he’s not going to take on Harris.” Some Democratic donors and officials are reaching out to West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin to consider standing for the presidential nomination, a source familiar confirmed to NewsNation. Manchin is reportedly considering registering as a Democrat once again to join the race. Newsom could, however, join Harris. If Harris secures the nomination, he’s one of the front-runners to become part of the new Democratic ticket. Others include: Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly Maryland Gov. Wes Moore Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer Garamendi thinks the female hopefuls will likely be ruled out if Harris is the nominee, but there are “several that are absolutely excellent vice president candidates.” Though Garamendi is sad that calls for Biden to leave grew loud enough to force his hand, he is ready to support whatever the future holds for the party: “That is now yesterday.” “I think we’ve got a terrific opportunity with Harris,” he added.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\n(NewsNation) — With nearly 4,000 delegates up for grabs during the Democratic National&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Governor Newsom supports Kamala Harris: Described as Strong, Courageous, and Persistent. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/governor-newsom-supports-kamala-harris-described-as-strong-courageous-and-persistent/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/rewrite-this-title-Gov-Newsom-endorses-Kamala-Harris-039Tough-Fearless.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-22 00:20:10","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.23},{"id":252300678,"title":"Many Democrats back Harris in 2024 race, but Pelosi, Obama silent","text":"Many Democrats on Sunday (Jul 21) quickly backed Vice President Kamala Harris to run as the party's presidential nominee against Donald Trump after incumbent President Joe Biden's abrupt departure from the race, but some powerful party members, including former House of Representatives speaker Nancy Pelosi, stayed quiet. After weeks of fighting among Democrats on whether Biden, 81, should stay in the race, a rush of support coalescing behind Harris, if she is to be the nominee, is crucial with just over 100 days before the November election. But there are plenty of doubts inside the Democratic Party about whether Harris can beat Trump, the Republican nominee and former president. Some Democrats have suggested that the party should hold a mini-primary before the August convention. Biden himself endorsed Harris on Sunday, in a separate statement following his letter saying that he is stepping down. He was quickly followed by the powerful Congressional Black Caucus, several key donors, various lawmakers and super PACs including Priorities USA and Unite the Country. \"Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year,\" Biden said on social media platform X. \"Democrats — it's time to come together and beat Trump. Let’s do this.\" The list of Democratic lawmakers endorsing Harris grew as the day progressed. By Sunday evening, the list included California Governor Gavin Newsom, Colorado Governor Jared Polis, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, US Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona, US Senator Patty Murray of Washington state, US Representative James Clyburn of South Carolina, and US Representative Pramila Jayapal of Massachusetts. Dmitri Mehlhorn, an adviser to Reid Hoffman, the LinkedIn founder and a major Democratic donor, called Harris \"the American dream personified,\" noting she is the daughter of immigrants. \"She is also toughness personified, rising from my home town of Oakland California to become the top prosecutor of the state. With Scranton Joe stepping back, I cannot wait to help elect President Harris.\" All 50 Democratic party state chairs will support Harris as the party's new presidential nominee, Reuters reported on Sunday, citing multiple sources. Former President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, who served as secretary of State under President Barack Obama, also endorsed Harris in a statement.","summary":"","url":"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/kamala-harris-democratic-presidential-nominee-pelosi-obama-silent-joe-biden-4495081","image":"https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--pGJFPIJt--/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2024-04:reuters_1,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_338,w_600/v1/one-cms/core/2024-07-21t203257z_1_lynxmpek6k085_rtroptp_3_usa-election-harri","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-22 00:18:36","author":null,"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"SG","sentiment":-0.117},{"id":252300640,"title":"National Review editorial board calls on Biden to resign immediately in scathing piece: 'Next logical step'","text":"The National Review editorial board called on President Biden to resign from office in a scathing editorial on Sunday after he announced he would not seek re-election in November. \"Biden should take the next logical step and resign the presidency,\" the editorial board wrote. \"It’s possible to imagine a president not being able to campaign but still being capable of carrying out his official duties — say, if he had a serious physical impairment. And it is even possible to imagine a president who could serve for another six months but not another four and a half years. But such scenarios do not apply to Biden.\" BIDEN ENDS BID FOR SECOND TERM IN WHITE HOUSE AS HE DROPS OUT OF HIS 2024 REMATCH WITH TRUMP The 81-year-old president has been under mounting pressure to drop out of the 2024 presidential race in the wake of his disastrous debate performance against former President Trump last month. His weak showing spurred concerns over whether he had the mental and physical stability to run a campaign and serve another four-year term. Biden finally bowed to that pressure on Sunday, writing in a public letter, \"It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President. And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.\" The group of senior editors at the National Review cheered Biden for doing \"the right thing in ending the charade of asking the American public to believe that he was capable of serving another four years as president. \"This was preposterous, and the public, as the polling has consistently shown for a long time, didn’t believe it,\" they wrote. WHAT COMES NEXT FOR DEMOCRATS AFTER BIDEN'S CAMPAIGN SUSPENSION? While Biden \"has obviously been confused in public…we are getting disturbing reports of his not recognizing friends and Democratic lawmakers in private,\" they continue. \"Whatever the level of his decline at the moment, it is sure to get worse. The country deserves to have complete assurance that the president of the United States, whatever his party or ideology, is fully in possession of his faculties.\" The editorial board goes on to point blame at Biden, his family, Democratic leadership and the media for deliberately concealing Biden's decline from the American public. \"Democrats wouldn’t be in this fix if Biden and his family had taken full accounting of his aging when they decided to run again last year and if the White House, Democratic leaders, the press, and various other insiders hadn’t undertaken an effort to cover up Biden’s state,\" the column reads. \"They all knew what was going on but figured that if they didn’t talk about it, somehow people wouldn’t notice. Of course, they did. LIBERAL MEDIA MEMBERS JUBILANT AS BIDEN DROPS OUT, RACE AGAINST TRUMP RESETS: ‘WHAT A MAN, WHAT A PATRIOT’ \"That cover-up was intended to deceive the American people, but its first victims were Democratic primary voters, who were denied a real choice or a real say in their party’s nominee. The serious potential candidates were sidelined by pressure to close ranks publicly behind Biden, who refused to debate the few, marginal primary opponents he attracted.\" The editors called on the Democratic Party to apologize to former presidential candidate Rep. Dean Phillips, who repeatedly warned about Biden’s current state but was dismissed for \"saying the quiet part out loud.\" They continue, charging Democrats and the media who turned against Biden after his debate debacle of doing so, \"not because they were conscience-stricken about previously lying about his condition, but because they got caught and feared losing. \"This shameful performance that literally put the country at risk should never be forgotten,\" the editors write. ‘NOT FIT TO SERVE:’ SPEAKER JOHNSON LEADS GOP DEMANDS FOR BIDEN TO RESIGN FROM PRESIDENCY The editors say Biden, who endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee, would \"make it easier for her to hit reset in the campaign\" if he resigned from office immediately. \"In isolation, Democrats would be better served to look beyond Harris, ideally to a governor with a more moderate image. But Biden’s endorsement, the compressed timetable, and the difficulty of passing over an African-American woman will presumably make that very difficult, if not impossible,\" they wrote. While Harris' political impact remains to be seen, \"At least the centerpiece of the Democratic campaign will no longer be a flagrant falsehood that nearly everyone recognizes as such,\" the editorial board concludes. CLINTONS ENDORSE KAMALA HARRIS HOURS AFTER BIDEN DROPS OUT \"Biden is no longer offering himself up as the next president of the United States until January 2029 and, if he really wants to put the country first as he said in his statement, should resign the presidency right now.\" The no-holds-barred editorial comes as Republican lawmakers call on Biden to resign from office immediately following his announcement to withdraw from the race. Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said in a statement, \"If Joe Biden is not fit to run for President, he is not fit to serve as President. He must resign the office immediately.

Biden, 81, made the announcement, bowing to mounting pressure from Democratic lawmakers, donors and voters. He officially endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to become the Democratic Party's nominee to take on former President Donald Trump in the Nov. 5 general election. It is unprecedented in America's modern history that despite dominating monthslong nomination contests, a presidential candidate suspended his campaign just weeks before a national party convention. Since the early 1950s, two Democratic presidents -- Harry Truman and Lyndon Johnson -- have desisted from running for another term during an election year. The Democratic Party has been preparing to hold its national convention in Chicago, Illinois, from Aug. 19-22 to officially nominate its standard-bearer. The Republican Party formally crowned Trump as the GOP nominee during its convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, last week. \"It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your president,\" Biden said in a statement posted on X, formerly Twitter. \"And while it has been my intention to seek re-election, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and focus entirely on fulfilling my duties as president for the remainder of my term,\" he added. In a separate post, Biden officially expressed his support for Harris. \"My very first decision as the party nominee in 2020 was to pick Kamala Harris as my vice president. And it's been the best decision I've made,\" he said. \"Today, I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year. Democrats -- it's time to come together and beat Trump. Let's do this.\" His exit from the race came amid unrelenting pressure on him to step aside following the June 27 presidential debate where he lost his train of thought, misspoke and failed to articulate his views on certain issues while Trump ramped up his criticism of Biden's policy. Dismissing the woeful debate performance as a one-off episode and stressing age as a source of \"wisdom,\" Biden had been trying to squelch concerns about his age through media interviews, a press conference and other public appearances. But the efforts failed to quell calls from Democratic leaders and others for him to bow out. Some party members not only questioned the viability of Biden's candidacy but also voiced concerns over the possibility of its impact on down-ballot races. Harris, 59, vowed to do \"everything\" to bring the Democratic Party together to defeat Trump in the general election. \"I am honored to have the president's endorsement, and my intention is to earn and win this nomination. Over the past year, I have traveled across the country, talking with Americans about the clear choice in this momentous election. And that is what I will continue to do in the days and weeks ahead,\" she said in a statement carried by the New York Times. \"I will do everything in my power to unite the Democratic Party -- and unite our nation -- to defeat Donald Trump and his extreme Project 2025 agenda. We have 107 days until Election Day. Together, we will fight. And together, we will win.\" Despite Biden's endorsement for Harris, uncertainty still lingers over whether she can be officially nominated given that more than 4,600 party delegates are free to vote for any candidate and will determine the ultimate nominee. But in the event of a contested nomination process, Harris -- with the backing of Biden -- is seen as being at an advantage, considering that Biden's campaign could help her with a growing number of Democrats and party supporters starting to coalesce behind her. A former senator from California, Harris, America's first female vice president, is expected to represent a new generation in the election battle against Trump, 78. If formally nominated, she would get an opportunity to try to become the first US woman president. Soon after Biden's announcement, Trump told CNN that he thinks Harris will be easier to defeat than Biden would have been. He also criticized Biden as one that goes \"down as the single worst president by far in the history of our country.\" In a post on Truth Social, Trump continued his criticism against Biden, saying the incumbent president is \"not fit to run for president\" and \"not fit to serve.\" \"He only attained the position of president by lies, fake news, and not leaving his basement,\" he wrote. \"All those around him, including his doctor and the media, knew that he wasn't capable of being president, and he wasn't.\" Biden has been self-isolating due to COVID-19 infection -- a pause that came at a time when questions have persisted over whether he is mentally and physically strong enough to effectively lead the country for another four-year term. On July 15, Trump was officially nominated as the GOP nominee for the presidential election. At the convention, his supporters cast him as a \"resilient\" leader as he has survived an assassination attempt during a recent campaign rally in Pennsylvania. The GOP event underscored his stable political footing despite his conviction in a high-profile hush-money trial in May. In a statement, former President Barack Obama backed Biden's decision to opt out, describing the president as a \"patriot of the highest order.\" \"I also know Joe has never backed down from a fight. For him to look at the political landscape and decide that he should pass the torch to a new nominee is surely one of the toughest in his life,\" he said. \"But I know he wouldn't make this decision unless he believed it was right for America.\" Obama expressed \"extraordinary confidence\" that Democratic Party leaders will be able to \"create a process from which an outstanding nominee emerges,\" while acknowledging the party will be navigating \"uncharted waters\" in the days ahead. In a social media post, House Speaker Mike Johnson called for Biden's resignation. \"If Joe Biden is not fit to run for President, he is not fit to serve as President,\" the Republican speaker wrote on X. \"He must resign the office immediately. November 5 cannot arrive soon enough.\" He also issued a warning against potential US \"adversaries.\" \"Regardless of the chaos in the current White House, our adversaries around the globe should be reminded that the US Congress, the US military, and the American people are fully prepared and committed to defend our interests both at home and abroad,\" he said.

His decision follows weeks of mounting pressure from within his party and from key Democratic donors urging him to step aside for the sake of the party's future.This announcement marks a significant shift in the political landscape as the Democratic Party must now quickly organize to select a new nominee before August 7.Gangel said Harris is considering Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro as potential running mates.\"There are clearly others, but those four names are the names I keep hearing about,\" Gangel said.Who Is Mark Kelly?Arizona Senator Mark Kelly is a former astronaut and U.S. Navy captain.

He was endorsed by NARAL Pro-Choice America.He supports legalizing casino gambling and sports betting, and he has also said he would not support an assault weapons ban.Beshear did not mention an endorsement for Harris in his comment after Biden withdrew from the 2024 presidential election. He did call Biden a \"consequential president.\"\"Along with Vice President Harris, he led us through the aftermath of the Jan. 6 attack on our Capitol and steadily steered us out of a global pandemic,\" the governor wrote. \"Now it is time for our nation to come together. We need to dial down the anger, rancor and noise. We have an opportunity to remember that we are taught to treat our neighbors as ourselves-and that we are all each other's neighbors.\"Who Is Roy Cooper?Roy Cooper III is the governor of North Carolina.

While the announcement may dispel widespread concern surrounding the Democratic nominee’s capacity to lead — especially relative to Republican nominee Donald Trump — the issue that has prompted mass protest against the Democratic incumbent still looms large over the campaign: Biden’s virtually unconditional support for Israel’s war on Gaza. Biden has maintained a chiefly deferential and supportive stance throughout Israel’s bombardment of Gaza. Now, some see his departure as opening the possibility for a reset on U.S. policy toward Israel. Former Biden Department of Education political appointee Tariq Habash — who resigned in January in protest of Biden’s policies on the Gaza war — notes that a significant part of the base is already disillusioned with Biden because of his unwillingness to enforce U.S. law and hold Israel accountable for violations of international humanitarian law. Biden’s decision also comes just two days after the International Court of Justice ruled that Israel’s occupation of Palestine constitutes illegal apartheid. “Whoever replaces the President on the ticket needs to show voters that there will be a substantive shift in policy that ends the dehumanization of Palestinians and supports Palestinian human rights, international law, and peace,” Habash said. “Obviously both Democrats and Republicans have a long way to go,” he added. “This week’s visit from Netanyahu is emblematic of that, as is President Biden’s refusal to hold his red lines, enforce Leahy or Foreign Assistance Act, or achieve a permanent ceasefire or return Palestinian and Israeli hostages.” Many critics had noted that Biden’s stance on Israel’s war revealed concerning signs of his leadership and adaptability far before the fateful June debate. “It was not Biden’s failed debate that showed he is unfit to lead. It was the tens of thousands of bombs he sent to kill Palestinian families,” the U.S. Campaign for Palestinian Rights said in a statement. “Biden’s refusal to adhere to international law or enforce U.S. law has deepened Israel’s illegal military occupation. The International Court of Justice’s latest advisory opinion on Friday asserted that every state has a legal obligation ‘not to render aid or assistance in maintaining the situation’ created by Israel’s denial of Palestinian rights.” No matter who replaces Biden, Riley Livermore — an Air Force major who said the Biden administration was “complicit in genocide” when he resigned in June — said the moment presents a possible inflection point for U.S. policy on Israel’s war. “That being said, Biden isn’t stepping down because of pressure on how brutal his Gaza policy was. From my perspective, the ongoing genocide in Gaza had minimal to no impact on the pressure for him to step down. I’m still disheartened that the Democratic Party doesn’t care about Palestinians and continues to offer unconditional support to Israel,” Livermore told The Intercept, repeating that he resigned due to Biden’s policies on Gaza, not his age. One senior Democratic aide told The Intercept that they were wary of the rushed process to replace the candidate that had little to do with how Biden’s support for a war that’s killed 15,000 children in Gaza may have already irreparably hurt his chances among crucial voting blocs. “The country needs to hear from an anti-war candidate who sees Palestinians as human beings,” they said. “It’s important that our next candidate is chosen through a democratic process at an open convention.” Biden and scores of elected officials and party caucuses have already thrown their support behind Vice President Kamala Harris to lead the Democratic ticket in November. And there have been signs that she may divert from Biden’s hard-line support for Israel’s campaign in Gaza. Late last year, Harris reportedly pushed the White House to be more sympathetic toward Palestinian suffering, and more forceful against Netanyahu to seek a long-term peace. In March, Harris delivered a speech in Selma, Alabama, forcefully calling for an “immediate ceasefire” and urging Israel to do more to increase the flow of aid to Gaza. “No excuses,” she insisted. While the speech seemed to mark a change in the administration’s stance on the war, reports surfaced that National Security Council officials had watered down parts of her speech. “We have to have a goal that we start working on right now, for peace and for an equal measure of security for Israelis and Palestinians,” Harris said later that month. “Palestinians have a right to self-determination; they have a right to dignity, and we’re going to have to work on that.” These reports have not gone unnoticed by people hoping for change in U.S. policy. Livermore said he was hopeful if Harris becomes the next president, she will take the opportunity to drastically change the U.S. posture toward Israel. “Harris has a choice between listening to her own humanity and the overwhelming will of the American people, or listening to donors and special interest groups by continuing to make genocide part of her platform and in doing so, delegitimizing America internationally.” “Leaders like myself, and the other Black faith leaders who signed open letters pressuring Biden to call for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza believe Harris would be much more sympathetic to the Palestinian cause if nominated,” Rev. Michael McBride, a pastor and founder of Black Church PAC said in a statement. “This could help reinvigorate a part of the base that has largely felt conflicted about casting a vote for Biden.” Waleed Shahid, co-founder of the Uncommitted National Movement — which has garnered over 700,000 people nationwide casting protest votes against Biden’s hard-line support for Israel — also noted dissenters’ openness to Harris. “While by no means a champion of the cause, I’ve heard numerous people note that Vice President Harris exhibited a deeply different emotional reaction to the stories of Palestinian suffering than President Biden,” he said in a statement. “While the Vice Presidency is limited, many feel that she would be an improvement from Biden’s severe lack of empathy for Palestinians and his ties to the AIPAC old guard in the party. However, challenging AIPAC’s power within the Democratic Party establishment remains a formidable task regardless of who the nominee is.”","summary":"Kamala Harris is less burdened by Biden's disastrous support for Israel's war, sparking some hope in pro-Palestine advocates\n\n\nThe post Biden Should Have Quit Over Gaza, but His Exit Could Be an Inflection Point appeared first on The Intercept.","url":"https://theintercept.com/2024/07/21/biden-quit-harris-president-gaza/","image":"https://theintercept.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AP20226455585742.jpg?fit=2469%2C1491","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-22 00:13:42","author":"Prem Thakker","authors":["Prem Thakker"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.046},{"id":252300588,"title":"Gov.

Inside the 'last-minute' decision that 'completely blindsided' White House and campaign staff... and who was there when he 'dropped a bomb' READ MORE: Inside the White House coverup of Biden's condition READ MORE: Stay up-to-date with DailyMail.com's political blog By Emily Goodin, Senior White House Correspondent and Nikki Schwab, Chief Campaign Correspondent Published: 00:11 BST, 22 July 2024 | Updated: 01:09 BST, 22 July 2024 e-mail View comments Following weeks of crisis talks and a growing tidal wave of Democrats and allies saying the writing was on the wall, Joe Biden's earth-shattering decision to withdraw from the presidential race was last-minute. The 81-year-old president was isolating with COVID in his Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, home when he and his shrinking inner circle composed a letter saying it was time to step aside. Donors had pulled millions of dollars in funds, the list of Democrats telling him to drop out was growing by the day, and polls suggested that his chance of beating Donald Trump was dwindling after his disastrous debate performance. Jill Biden was there when her husband made the historic call, giving into mounting pressure. The question now is what pushed him to finally make the extraordinary move that blindsided some of his White House staff and most of the people working on his re-election campaign. Jill Biden has been with husband Joe Biden in Rehoboth as he made his decision on the 2024 presidential race - above the couple at their beach home in February On Saturday evening, Biden summoned to his side two men who have been there since his political start: advisers Steve Ricchetti and Mike Donilon. They have been with him through the best of times - his first years as a senator - to the worst of times - the death of his son Beau Biden. Already with the president and the first lady were their closest aides Annie Tomasini and Anthony Bernal, who they refer to as 'family.' Biden asked Ricchetti and Donilon to start drafting a letter and begin the process of how to make a public announcement, DailyMail.com confirmed. And the president also told his family. It suggests that Biden ultimately weighed the evidence against him and made the call that he couldn't move forward for the good of the party. He had insisted that he would only step aside if he was shown polling that proved Kamala Harris would fare better than him against Trump in the general election, or if he developed a 'medical condition.' Read More EXCLUSIVE Inside the White House cover-up before Biden dropped out Was he given statistics showing he was doomed in November? Did he decide he wasn't healthy enough to serve another four years? Or did he make a selfless decision based on the good of the future of the party? At 1:45 pm on Sunday, Biden, still at the beach house in Delaware, began calling his senior staff at the White House and the campaign. He had already spoken with Vice President Kamala Harris and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. In each conversation, he dropped his bombshell: He was exiting the presidential race. At 1:46 pm, his campaign account posted a letter from the president announcing his decision even as he was still on the staff call. Most of his staff – both in the White House and at the campaign - were shocked. They learned the news online, getting the alert when the @JoeBiden account posted the president's missive. 'No one had a heads up before the tweet posted,' a campaign staffer told DailyMail.com. 'Which, to me, is an insane way to treat the 1300 people that work for you on the campaign.' Steve Ricchetti, counselor to the president, (left) and Mike Donilon, campaign adviser, (right) were called to Rehoboth Beach to help Biden write the letter on his decision It capped a chaotic 48 hours for the Biden family as they hunkered in behind their patriarch with a small, inner circle of longtime aides supporting them. Some were even reporting back to Jill Biden about those staffers deemed disloyal. Meanwhile, Biden had veered from angry at the pressure from his party to acceptance of the situation. And once his final decision was made on Saturday night, the rest moved quickly. Biden called Harris directly to tell her the news. He also had one-on-one calls with White House chief of staff Jeff Zients and campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon, according to reports. He would also speak with his Cabinet, Members of Congress, governors, and supporters. But it all happened so fast many staff were hurt about the way they learned of the news, although they weren't surprised by it. The writing has been on the wall. Almost 40 Democratic lawmakers had called on Biden to exit the race. Major donors were threatening to pull their support. Actor George Clooney wrote an op-ed in the New York Times calling on Biden to step down. And Barack Obama was reportedly working behind the scenes to get Biden to move aside. It 'needed to happen,' a Democratic aide said. 'But he kinda just dropped a bomb. Like it's not surprising but it's shocking.' Another staffer said people were feeling 'a mix of relief, gratefulness, hope.' The campaign held an all-hands on deck call at 5 pm ET to reassure staff they still had their jobs. Campaign Chair Jen O'Malley Dillon acknowledged that it was 'hard for staff who may have gotten the news while they were working or door knocking, but it was important for the president to hear from him in his own words.' President Joe Biden, from left, walks with White House deputy chief of staff Annie Tomasini, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, White House deputy chief of staff Bruce Reed and White House communications director Ben LaBolt in April Anthony Bernal, senior adviser to Jill Biden, and Annie Tomasini, deputy chief of staff, exit the White House together in February - he runs the East Wing; she runs the West Wing Publicly, aides have been loyal to Biden. Many have gone on TV and taken to social media to defend the president since his disastrous debate performance against Donald Trump 24 days ago, arguing Biden was the party's nominee and planned to stay the nominee. Since the June 26th debate, staff had been trying to go about business as usual, pushing back at reports Biden would drop out. 'Fanfiction' declared deputy press secretary Andrew Bates said of reports Biden would drop out this weekend, advising Democrats to 'keep the faith.' Even on Sunday morning, the message from the campaign was Biden was in it to win it. Campaign co-chairman Cedric Richmond, said on CBS Face the Nation on Sunday morning: 'I want to be crystal clear. He's made a decision and that decision is to accept the nomination and run for reelection, win reelection.' Officials defended the manner in which the decision was announced. It was made at the 'last minute,' a White House official said. It was actually made in the last 24 hours, with only Biden's family and a small circle of close aides knowing of his decision. And by withholding it from senior staff until the last minute - and not telling junior staff at all - the news didn't leak. It came out on Biden's terms. It all fits with a man said to be frustrated at what he saw as a public pressure campaign to force his hand. Biden has spent the past four days being isolated both physically and politically. He is at the beach house in Delaware, on the Atlantic Ocean as he recovers from COVID, still coughing and hoarse from the virus. First lady Jill Biden has been with him, although staying in a separate room. And, it has been from there the president has watched Democrat after Democrat call for his exit even as he spent the past three weeks trying to reassure the party he was mentally and physically up to a second term. But, despite everything he's done - national TV interviews, local radio interviews, a press conference, and campaign stops - nothing had quelled the tide against him. Joe Biden endorsed Kamala Harris Hunter Biden, Melissa Cohen, Joe Biden and Jill Biden in July - his family has stood by him In the aftermath of the decision, Biden's family was loud and clear in their love and support, praising him for his service to the country. Jill Biden sent him her love on Sunday afternoon, retweeting his letter with two red hearts. Naomi Biden, the Bidens' eldest granddaughter, wrote a long post on X, where she said she was 'proud' of her 'pop,' which is what the grandchildren call President Biden. She noted: 'Our world is better today in so many ways thanks to him. To the Americans who have always had his back, keep the faith. He will always have ours.' And Hunter Biden said in a statement of his father: 'He is unique in public life today, in that there is no distance between Joe Biden the man and Joe Biden the public servant of the last 54 years. I'm so lucky every night I get to tell him I love him, and to thank him. I ask all Americans to join me tonight in doing the same. Thank you, Mr. President. I love you, Dad.'

Here’s what to know about the barrier-breaking current vice president. Harris, 59, became the first woman, Black person and South Asian person to serve as vice president when she took office in 2021. If she secures the party nomination, she could become the first woman and South Asian person and second Black person ever to head a major party presidential ticket and potentially be elected president. On Sunday, Harris said she is “honored to have the President’s endorsement and my intention is to earn and win this nomination.” Harris briefly ran against Biden in the Democratic 2020 presidential primary, citing a lack of funding in her decision to drop out in December 2019. Through her short campaign, Harris found moments to stand out in primary debates, leaning on her background as a prosecutor, and touted a “3 a.m. agenda” highlighting “issues that keep you up at night.” Her stance on healthcare drew critics among progressives and moderates, stopping just short of a “Medicare for All” universal healthcare proposal. The vice president broke many more barriers throughout her political career, also becoming the first woman and first Black attorney general and U.S. senator for California. Originally from Oakland, California, Harris was born on Oct. 20, 1964 to immigrant parents active in civil rights activism. Her father is from Jamaica, while her mother moved from southern India. The former prosecutor has spoken about the active role of social justice and advocacy and things like being bused to school in her childhood. She attended college at Howard University in Washington, DC before returning to the San Francisco area for law school. Harris became a prosecutor, citing a desire to change the system from the inside, and ran for San Francisco district attorney in 2003. She campaigned for Barack Obama’s presidential campaign in 2008, and the former president endorsed her successful bid for California attorney general in 2010. As attorney general, Harris pledged to uphold the death penalty despite her moral opposition to it and refused to defend Proposition 8, which was passed by voters in 2008 and banned same-sex marriage. Her actions in response to police killings of Black men garnered attention, as she implemented measures like tracking racial data in police stops, but didn’t seek more aggressive oversight. Harris married entertainment lawyer Douglas Emhoff in 2014 and is stepmother to Emhoff’s two children. In 2016, Harris launched a campaign for the Senate, when California Sen. Barbara Boxer retired the seat. Throughout her Senate tenure, Harris gained attention for her forceful questioning taking on an array of Trump nominees and administration officials. On recent poll from the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found about 6 in 10 Democrats believe Harris would do well in presidential slot, about 2 in 10 don’t believe she would, and 2 in 10 don’t know. The poll found about 4 in 10 adults in the U.S. have a favorable opinion of the vice president.","summary":"Now endorsed to be the Democrat's next presidential candidate by President Biden, Kamala Harris has again stepped into the spotlight of another presidential race -- here's what to know about the barrier-breaking current vice president.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2024/07/21/bidens-presidential-endorsement-what-to-know-about-vice-president-kamala-harris/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AP24201815673578.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-22 00:09:22","author":"Grace Zokovitch","authors":["Grace Zokovitch"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.254},{"id":252300608,"title":"Biden ‘mentally unfit’ to have nuclear codes – top Republican","text":"US President Joe Biden has declared that he plans to serve out the remainder of his term, which officially ends in January, but he is facing growing pressure from critics to step down after deciding not to seek re-election in November. Just moments after Biden announced his decision on Sunday, Rep. Richard Hudson, chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee, accused Democrats of lying to the American people. He argued that if Biden lacks the mental capacity to run for re-election, he cannot continue to serve the remainder of his term. “This is a scandal of historic proportions. President Biden is incapacitated, Democrats knew, and they lied to the American people to cover it up. If Biden is mentally unfit to campaign, he is mentally unfit to have the nuclear codes,” Hudson wrote in a post on X (formerly Twitter). US House Speaker Mike Johnson echoed that sentiment, calling the development an “unprecedented juncture in American history” and urging Biden to resign immediately. “If Joe Biden is not fit to run for President, he is not fit to serve as President. He must resign the office immediately. November 5 cannot arrive soon enough,” Johnson said in a statement, adding that the Democrats’ prospects “are no better” with Harris. A host of Republican lawmakers also joined the chorus calling for Biden’s resignation. Florida Senator Rick Scott, Louisiana Representative Steve Scalise, and House Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik of New York are among dozens who have demanded that Biden relinquish the presidency. Earlier in the day, before the US leader announced his move, Ohio Senator and Trump’s running mate, J.D. Vance, questioned how Biden can “justify remaining President” if he drops out from the race. “Not running for re-election would be a clear admission that President Trump was right all along about Biden not being mentally fit enough to serve as Commander-in-Chief. There is no middle ground,” Vance wrote.","summary":"President Joe Biden has declared that he plans to serve out the remainder of his term, but is facing growing pressure from critics to resign \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/601451-republicans-urge-biden-resign/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.07/article/669da1ef85f5402bcd1cd33c.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-22 00:05:18","author":null,"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.149},{"id":252300240,"title":"Democrats assure a smooth transition to replace Biden, leaning towards Harris but uncertainties persist.","text":"WASHINGTON – Shortly after President Joe Biden announced Sunday that he would drop his reelection campaign, Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison had a message: There would be no automatic coronation for his replacement. “In the coming days, the party will undertake a transparent and orderly process to move forward,” Harrison said in a statement. “This process will be governed by established rules and procedures of the party. Our delegates are prepared to take seriously their responsibility in swiftly delivering a candidate to the American people.“ The comment reflected the reality that while Vice President Kamala Harris is emerging as the prohibitive favorite to become the party’s nominee — backed already by Biden and many Democrats — it’s not so simple. And for now, the party isn’t offering many details on what happens next. Harris has to formally secure the nomination from the around 4,700 Democratic convention delegates — including those pledged to Biden, as well as the elected officials, former presidents and other party elders known as superdelegates. She spent part of Sunday calling elected officials and delegates to solidify their support. Biden won Democratic primaries in every state, and Harris was on the ticket as his running mate. His tapping her as his successor while bowing out of the race further strengthens her case, as does the endorsements of party heavyweights like South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn. Many other Democratic leaders openly backed the vice president even before Biden left the race, urging him to “pass the torch” to her in the wake of his dismal debate performance against Republican nominee Donald Trump last month. “Folks will be weighing in and they should. I think we’re seeing a lot of coalescing behind the vice president,” said Rahna Epting, executive director of the progressive activist organization MoveOn. “And that’s important because, as we saw throughout the Biden debate fallout, there is momentum that can be built one way or the other, and it is important for us to build momentum toward unity.” Ken Martin, president of the Association of State Democratic Committees, which represents the 57 parties in the states and territories, said Harris was the obvious choice: “Having served alongside President Biden, she is ready on day one as a candidate and as our next president.” She was also endorsed by the executive council of the 1.75-million-member American Federation of Teachers union. But Democratic rules state only that delegates “in all good conscience” vote for the candidate they were elected to represent, with no mechanism for defectors. And some in the party have endorsed an open nominating process. There’s been active debate about how to proceed among lawmakers, major donors and former high-ranking officials of the Biden, Obama and Clinton administrations, a Democrat with deep ties to the Biden administration, said Sunday. The person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal conversations, argued that Harris would benefit from a competitive mini-primary ahead of the Democratic convention, because it would help her seal her bonafides as a strong candidate and diminish criticism that she’s been undemocratically anointed. That’s a charge the Trump campaign has already sought to use against her, and could loom large in the battle for undecided voters in battleground states. But such a scenario might leave Democrats heading into their national convention without a clear nominee, and perhaps choosing one via a series of floor votes. That could mean top Democratic candidates looking to replace Biden resorting to visiting individual state delegations to lobby — a process unseen since 1960, when Johnson and John F. Kennedy jockeyed for support during that year’s Democratic convention in Los Angeles. If that happened, in addition to Harris, many other leading Democrats who had endorsed Biden in 2024 while harboring their own presidential aspirations for future cycles could vie for the nomination, including California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and California Rep. Ro Khanna. Inside the White House, however, there’s low expectation that Harris will get a serious challenge, according to a person familiar with deliberations who requested anonymity to discuss the private conversations. Whitmer has already said she won’t run, and Newsom has said he would back Harris if she became the nominee. Others who have been mentioned as viable contenders — including Shapiro and North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper — have both endorsed Harris and would also seem unlikely to run in light of Biden’s endorsement of the vice president, and the expected fundraising advantage she would hold over anyone who’d enter the field. Further complicating matters is the fact that the DNC had planned to hold a virtual roll call to choose its nominee ahead of the convention, in order to meet Ohio ballot eligibility rules. That state’s original deadline ballot deadline was Aug. 7, and though the Legislature has since approved a law nullifying that, it doesn’t take effect until Sept. 1. DNC lawyers say that means the party could face legal challenges in Ohio if it fails to name their party’s nominee prior to the state’s original deadline. But the convention rules committee has said it won’t set a date for the virtual roll call — which could take place over several days — before Aug. 1. Some Democrats fear a host of other GOP legal challenges, including New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who had defended Biden staying in the race by arguing that replacing him might trigger “a presidential election being decided by Clarence Thomas and the Supreme Court” — like what happened during the 2000 presidential election and the disputed recount in Florida. At this week’s conventions rules committee meeting, members could establish virtual roll call rules and a process to nominate Harris. But they could also create a more open process for choosing a nominee, according to a person familiar with the process on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Harrison refrained from endorsing Harris in a statement, saying only, “In short order, the American people will hear from the Democratic Party on next steps and the path forward for the nomination process.” A somber Harrison also joined a virtual meeting of the convention credentials committee on Sunday, telling members, “I’m emotional.” “I still support my president,” Harrison said of Biden. “And we will get through this, my friends, as we always do.” ___ Associated Press writer Colleen Long contributed to this report.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nWASHINGTON – Shortly after President Joe Biden announced Sunday that he would&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Democrats assure a smooth transition to replace Biden, leaning towards Harris but uncertainties persist. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/democrats-assure-a-smooth-transition-to-replace-biden-leaning-towards-harris-but-uncertainties-persist/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/rewrite-this-title-Democrats-promise-039orderly-process039-to-replace-Biden.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-22 00:02:45","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.029},{"id":252300632,"title":"What A Kamala Harris Foreign Policy Could Look Like","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to stick largely to Joe Biden's foreign policy playbook on key issues such as Ukraine, China and Iran but could strike a tougher tone with Israel over the Gaza war if she replaces the president at the top of the Democratic ticket and wins the U.S. November election. As the apparent frontrunner for the nomination after Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed her on Sunday, Harris would bring on-the-job experience, personal ties forged with world leaders, and a sense of global affairs gained during a Senate term and as Biden's second-in-command. But running against Republican candidate Donald Trump she would also have a major vulnerability - a troubled situation at the U.S.-Mexico border that has bedeviled Biden and become a top campaign issue. Harris was tasked at the start of his term with addressing the root causes of high irregular migration, and Republicans have sought to make her the face of the problem. On a range of global priorities, said analysts, a Harris presidency would resemble a second Biden administration. \"She may be a more energetic player but one thing you shouldn't expect - any immediate big shifts in the substance of Biden's foreign policy,\" said Aaron David Miller, a former Middle East negotiator for Democratic and Republican administrations. Harris has signaled, for instance, that she would not deviate from Biden's staunch support for NATO and would continue backing Ukraine in its fight against Russia. That stands in sharp contrast to a pledge by former president Trump to fundamentally alter the U.S. relationship with the alliance and the doubts he has raised about future weapons supplies to Kyiv. Staying On The Course On China? A lawyer by training and a former California attorney general, Harris struggled in the first half of Biden's term to find her footing, not helped by being saddled early on with a major part of the intractable immigration portfolio amid record crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border. That followed a failed 2020 presidential campaign that was widely considered lackluster. If she becomes the nominee, Democrats will be hoping Harris will be more effective at communicating her foreign policy goals. In the second half of Biden's presidency, Harris - the country's first Black and Asian American vice president - has elevated her profile on issues ranging from China and Russia to Gaza and become a known quantity to many world leaders. At this year's Munich Security Conference she delivered a tough speech slamming Russia for its invasion of Ukraine and pledging \"ironclad\" U.S. respect for NATO's Article 5 requirement for mutual self-defense. On China, Harris has long positioned herself within Washington's bipartisan mainstream on the need for the U.S. to counter China's influence, especially in Asia. She would likely maintain Biden's stance of confronting Beijing when necessary while also seeking areas of cooperation, analysts say. Harris has made several trips aimed at boosting relations in the economically dynamic region, including one to Jakarta in September to fill in for Biden at a summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). During the visit, Harris accused China of trying to coerce smaller neighbors with its territorial claims in the disputed South China Sea. Biden also dispatched Harris on travels to shore up alliances with Japan and South Korea, key allies who have had reason to worry about Trump's commitment to their security. \"She demonstrated to the region that she was enthusiastic to promote the Biden focus on the Indo-Pacific,\" said Murray Hiebert, a senior associate of the Southeast Asia Program at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies. While she could not match the \"diplomatic chops\" Biden had developed over decades, \"she did fine,\" he added. However, like her boss, Harris has been prone to the occasional verbal gaffe. On a tour of the Demilitarized Zone between South and North Korea in September 2022 to reassert Washington's support for Seoul, she mistakenly touted a U.S. \"alliance with the Republic of North Korea,\" which aides later corrected. If Harris becomes her party's standard-bearer and can overcome Trump's lead in pre-election opinion polls to win the White House, the Israel-Palestinian conflict would rank high on her agenda, especially if the Gaza war is still raging. Although as vice president she has mostly echoed Biden in firmly backing Israel's right to defend itself after Hamas carried out a deadly cross-border raid on Oct. 7, she has at times stepped out slightly ahead of the president in criticizing Israel's military approach. In March, she bluntly criticized Israel, saying it was not doing enough to ease a \"humanitarian catastrophe\" during its ground offensive in the Palestinian enclave. Later that month, she did not rule out \"consequences\" for Israel if it launched a full-scale invasion of refugee-packed Rafah in southern Gaza. Such language has raised the possibility that Harris, as president, might take at least a stronger rhetorical line with Israel than Biden, analysts say. While her 81-year-old boss has a long history with a succession of Israeli leaders and has even called himself a \"Zionist,\" Harris, 59, lacks his visceral personal connection to the country. She maintains closer ties to Democratic progressives, some of whom have pressed Biden to attach conditions to U.S. weapons shipments to Israel out of concern for high Palestinian civilian casualties in the Gaza conflict. But analysts do not expect there would be a big shift in U.S. policy toward Israel, Washington's closest ally in the Middle East. Halie Soifer, who served as national security adviser to Harris during the then-senator's first two years in Congress, from 2017 to 2018, said Harris' support of Israel has been just as strong as Biden's. \"There really has been no daylight to be found\" between the two, she said. Iran Nuclear Threat Harris could also be expected to hold firm against Israel's regional arch-foe, Iran, whose recent nuclear advances have drawn increased U.S. condemnation. Jonathan Panikoff, formerly the U.S. government's deputy national intelligence officer for the Middle East, said the growing threat of \"weaponization\" of Iran's nuclear program could be an early major challenge for a Harris administration, especially if Tehran decides to test the new U.S. leader. After a series of failed attempts, Biden has shown little interest in returning to negotiations with Tehran over resuming the 2015 international nuclear agreement, which Trump abandoned during his presidency. Harris, as president, would be unlikely to make any major overtures without serious signs that Iran is ready to make concessions. Even so, Panikoff, now at the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington, said: \"There's every reason to believe the next president will have to deal with Iran. It's bound to be one of the biggest problems.\" (Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)","summary":"Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to stick largely to Joe Biden's foreign policy playbook on key issues such as Ukraine, China and Iran but could strike a tougher tone with Israel over the Gaza war if she replaces the president at the top of t","url":"https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/tougher-tone-on-israel-steady-on-nato-what-a-kamala-harris-foreign-policy-could-look-like-6157890","image":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-07/scc1vsuo_kamala-harris_625x300_22_July_24.jpeg?im=FaceCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738?ver-20240615.100","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-22 00:01:01","author":null,"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.034},{"id":252300502,"title":"Aviation summit opens amid jet shortages, supply chain turbulence","text":"FARNBOROUGH, England : Aviation leaders will meet at a marque summit outside London on Monday as the industry struggles with supply chain disruptions, aircraft delays and floundering plans to reduce carbon emissions. The July 22-26 Farnborough Airshow, a gathering of top executives from airlines, aircraft makers and weapons manufacturers, has often been a festival of orders for passenger jets from Boeing and Airbus. Many delegates said the show is not expected to produce a flurry of orders as Airbus struggles to reach output goals and Boeing adopts a low-key posture amid its safety crisis, which was triggered by a door panel flying off a 737 MAX jet in January. Some deals will get over the line, delegates said. Virgin Atlantic is close to placing a top-up order for Airbus A330neos and Flynas, a Saudi low-cost carrier, is poised to order up to 30 of the same widebody aircraft, industry sources said. Japan Airlines is expected to firm up recent tentative orders for jets and Boeing is seeing leasing interest for its 737 MAX, while Turkish Airlines is in the midst of negotiations to buy Boeing jets, industry sources said. The companies declined to comment. Industry bosses will also be looking for any further sign of weakness in air passenger demand following a handful of profit warnings from airlines. Ryanair, a low-cost carrier bellwether, will report quarterly results on Monday. With dealmaking limited, the focus is likely to fall on how to remove supply chain blockages and speed up the delivery of planes to frustrated airlines. Aviation was hit hard by the pandemic which saw air travel collapse only to bounce back sharply. That has left many firms scrambling to resolve labour and parts shortages. The situation has been exacerbated by a spiralling crisis at Boeing, which has had to slow down production of its best-selling 737 MAX plane following the door blowout. Stephanie Pope, Boeing’s head of commercial aircraft, said at a media briefing on Sunday that 737 MAX production was improving and the company was undergoing “transformational change” across safety and corporate culture. Airbus Chief Executive Guillaume Faury also told journalists on Sunday that the planemaker was making progress ramping up production of its top passenger jets. POLITICAL TURBULENCE Aerospace and defence companies, which rely heavily on government-funded programmes, are closely assessing a turbulent political period in Western democracies, with a new Labour government in Britain, a fragmented parliament in France, and an election in the United States in November. \"We are indeed in a world that is changing all the time ... very volatile, very unpredictable, and quite challenging for industries,\" Faury told reporters on Sunday. Faury's comments turned out to be prescient. About an hour later, U.S. President Joe Biden announced he was ending his re-election bid and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to replace him. This week’s air show will be peppered with sustainability panels and workshops as aerospace giants and airlines seek to emphasise their commitment to reducing carbon emissions, even as they plan to massively expand global air travel. On the defence side, the focus will be on Ukraine, possible delays to America's future F-22 fighter replacement, code-named NGAD, and a defence review by Britain's new Labour government. British Prime Minister Kier Starmer is expected to attend the airshow on Monday. Defence executives will be looking for any signals about what impact Labour’s review could have on their programmes.","summary":"","url":"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/aviation-summit-opens-amid-jet-shortages-supply-chain-turbulence-4495371","image":"https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--5PI6flVF--/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2024-04:reuters_1,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_338,w_600/v1/one-cms/core/2024-07-22t000048z_2_lynxmpek6k09z_rtroptp_3_britain-airshow-us","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-22 00:00:48","author":null,"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"sg","sentiment":-0.051},{"id":252300252,"title":"Vice President Kamala Harris | 60 Minutes Archive","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris | 60 Minutes Archive Vice President Kamala Harris spoke with 60 Minutes' Bill Whitaker in October about Israel, Ukraine, and the 2024 presidential election.

They lied, and they got caught. The Democratic Party line on President Biden was that he had turned in an exceptionally effective State of the Union address. He might mess up a name here or there, but he had gotten better with age. He should be judged on his achievements, which rivaled those of LBJ. Anything suggesting he was in decline was a paranoid lie, or — in a truly ridiculous neologism — “a cheap fake.” Everything we saw with our own eyes was misleading. No, he hadn’t wandered off at the G-7 summit. No, he hadn’t frozen up at his Hollywood fundraiser. No, everything was fine. No one formally enforced this party line, but everyone knew to follow it — Democratic leaders, journalists, and donors. The whispered conversations stayed whispered. Then, the debate happened, and before it had ended, the party line was inoperative. There were attempts to revive it, but it was a little like being a Communist in the 1930s when Stalin wrenched the party into a totally new position. It didn’t matter whether the new had any connection to the prior line; it had to be followed. So, Joe Scarborough of MSNBC, who months earlier had issued forth with table-thumping assurances that Joe Biden was at the absolute top of his game, suddenly thought he might have to step aside. George Clooney, who co-hosted the aforementioned Hollywood fundraiser, wrote in The New York Times that Biden at that event was a shadow of his self, and suddenly former Obama speechwriter Jon Favreau could say that everyone he talked to at the event was appalled by Biden’s state. The president can be forgiven for being disappointed and angry that everyone who had been covering for him switched overnight. There’s no honor among thieves, but shouldn’t there be at least a little among political co-conspirators? Biden showed monumentally poor judgment in deciding to run again last year. He almost certainly was in the grips of legitimate self-delusion, though. His enablers were truly cynical and dishonest, hoping that their fake narrative about Biden’s continued vitality could see them through until November. Their credibility should be shot as they attempt their great switcheroo. The same Democratic establishment that gave you Joe Biden without offering Democratic voters a legitimate choice (serious primary challengers were warned off this year), now wants to give you Kamala Harris without offering Democratic voters a legitimate choice. The same party that lied about Joe Biden without compunction or remorse now wants you to credit everything it is going to tell us about the marvelous, heretofore unappreciated qualities of Kamala Harris. The same vice president who insisted, as of roughly the day before yesterday, that Joe Biden was the very picture of energy and effectiveness now wants us to believe everything else she’s going to say after he’s been forced from the race by his feeble state. The same people who thought Joe Biden was incapable of doing interviews and teleprompter speeches on the campaign trail will tell us he’s perfectly capable of fulfilling his duties in the most trying job on the planet. Finally, the same Democrats who were threatening Joe Biden with ignominy and exclusion if he stayed in the race a couple of more weeks now want us to buy their paeans to his great statesmanship. In sum, the perpetrators of a shameful cover-up want us to move on as if nothing happened, when the stink of their rank deception should dog their candidate and their party the rest of this campaign.

It comes after the mounting pressure and concerns about his health and his disastrous debate performance against Trump. In a letter published on X, the new name for Twitter, Biden said: \"I believe it is in the best interests of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.\" US Vice President Kamala Harris has said she will \"earn and win\" the Democratic nomination for president and beat Donald Trump after she was endorsed by Joe Biden.

Some users suggested the Kamala Harris memes/edits on social media have made her more appealing to young voters. The “It’s Joever” meme appears to have made a sensational return. The phrase signals complete physical and mental defeat, sheer hopelessness. Suggesting it’s not just over—it’s “Joever.” In 2020, an anonymous user mocking the electoral hopes of progressives posted a “prediction” that Joe Biden would lose, posting the very first “It’s Joever,” along with a picture of a sad-looking Biden, standing at a podium. Several X users shared throwbacks to Kamala's 2019 campaign and urged 'bring this tone back for 2024 please'. We take a look at some of today's Twitter memes - from fake mock ups of Kamala's future Time Magazine cover to the bizarre reason people were using ice cream to mock Joe Biden: The irony of the announcement landing on National Ice Cream Day was certainly not lost on the internet, one X user wrote: \"Possibly the most historic national ice cream day we've ever had.\" Even Elon Musk commented on the timing of Biden's announcement coinciding with the national day after branding X a \"meme goldmine\". Kamala Harris, 59, holds a lead over several other potential Democratic candidates. She was part of a successful presidential ticket with Biden, has built years of goodwill with key party demographics, and would likely have access to a significant campaign fund amassed by the Biden reelection effort. Several delegates have already pledged their loyalty towards Harris, reports the Mirror US.

U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren said that she will join the President in endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris’ run for the party nomination they all sought in 2020, after giving the 46th President credit for the work he’s done over the last three years and for beating former president Donald Trump in the first place. “(Harris) is a proven fighter who has been a national leader in safeguarding consumers and protecting access to abortion. As a former prosecutor, she can press a forceful case against allowing Donald Trump to regain the White House. We have many talented people in our party, but Vice President Harris is the person who was chosen by the voters to succeed Joe Biden if needed. She can unite our party, take on Donald Trump, and win in November,” Warren said. Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey, long seen as a Biden campaign surrogate, thanked the President for his lifetime of service and his work in turning the economy around. “President Biden’s decision today not to seek reelection is the ultimate example of putting the country first — something Joe Biden has done over and over again in his unparalleled career. We are all deeply grateful to President Biden for his lifetime of service,” she said. U.S. Rep. Katherine Clark, the House Minority Whip, said Biden’s decision tells of his “steadfast courage” and love of country. “Around the globe, he is admired for his steady, experienced leadership — always honoring America’s crucial role as a facilitator of peace, democracy, and human rights,” she said in a statement. Salem’s U.S. Rep. Seth Moulton said via social media that he’s “proud of our president, who will go down in history as a great statesman.” “Proud to endorse our vice president, who has the energy, courage, and vision to beat Donald Trump. Now let’s come together and get to work,” he said. Joe Biden “saved our Democracy in 2020,” according to U.S. Rep. Lori Trahan, and he’s taking the right step to do the same again now. “President Biden’s decision to pass the baton positions us to defeat Donald Trump again this November and build on the work we’ve done. Together with our strong, proven Vice President Kamala Harris, Democrats will make a clear, effective case to voters why our commitment to improving the lives of every American is the better choice than Donald Trump’s chaotic and extreme Republican Party,” she said. U.S. Rep. Ayana Pressley said of Harris that she’s “all in, let’s go.” Massachusetts Senate President Karen Spilka said Biden’s decision demonstrates what “true leadership looks like.” Boston Mayor Michelle Wu said Harris is “the leader we need to meet this moment.” “Democrats will win in November, and I will do all I can to help. I’m excited to organize and vote for Vice president Harris,” she said. “One of the most consequential presidents of my lifetime just put his country before himself, as he always has. Unity matters now more than ever before – it’s time for Democrats to come together behind Vice President Harris to defeat Donald Trump,” she said. MassGOP Chairwoman Amy Carnevale said that decision to back Harris won’t help Democrats in November. “No matter the nominee, Americans now see through the Democratic Party. From the economy to border security, Democrats have fallen short. Americans want a shift, and we’re confident that no Democrat will measure up to the Republican ticket,” she said.","summary":"\"We have many talented people in our party, but Vice President Harris is the person who was chosen by the voters to succeed Joe Biden if needed.

Vice President Kamala Harris, who Biden endorsed as his replacement on the ballot, is 59. Robert F.

With efforts ongoing to bring about a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas, rising concerns about the war spreading to Lebanon and Yemen, and the U.S. in the midst of a dizzying election campaign, Netanyahu’s speech has the potential to cause disarray on both sides of the ocean. The risks only increased with Biden’s decision Sunday to drop out of the race for president, especially since the choice of a replacement Democratic nominee — and the potential next American leader — are still up in the air. A person familiar with Biden’s schedule confirmed Sunday that the president will host Netanyahu at the White House. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly, said the exact timing of the meeting has not been established because Biden is recovering from COVID-19. Netanyahu is scheduled to address Congress on Wednesday. He is also expected to meet with Vice President Kamala Harris, who is seeking the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination. An official in Netanyahu’s office confirmed that the Israeli leader was set to travel to Washington on Monday. The official also spoke on condition of anonymity pending a formal announcement. Netanyahu will deliver his congressional address with an eye on several audiences: his ultranationalist governing partners, the key to his political survival; the Biden administration, which Netanyahu counts on for diplomatic and military support; and Donald Trump’s Republican Party, which could offer Netanyahu a reset in relations if he is reelected in November. His words risk angering any one of those constituencies, which the Israeli leader cannot afford if he hopes to hold on to his tenuous grip on power. “There are a few land mines and pitfalls on this trip,” Eytan Gilboa, an expert on U.S.-Israel relations at Israel’s Bar-Ilan University, said before Biden’s withdrawal. “He is thought of as a political wizard who knows how to escape from traps. I am not sure he still knows how to do that.” It is Netanyahu’s fourth speech to Congress — more than any other world leader. During his address, his far-right governing partners will want to hear his resolve to continue the war and topple Hamas. The Biden administration will look for progress toward the latest U.S.-backed cease-fire proposal and details on a postwar vision. Republicans hope Netanyahu besmirches Biden and bolsters the GOP’s hoped-for perception as Israel’s stalwart supporter. Upon receiving the invitation, Netanyahu said he would “present the truth about our just war against those who seek to destroy us.” The war, which was sparked by Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel, has tested Israel’s ties with its top ally as never before. The Biden administration has stood staunchly beside Israel. But it has grown increasingly alarmed about the conduct of the Israeli military, the continued difficulties of getting humanitarian aid into Gaza, especially after the short-lived U.S. military pier off Gaza coast, as well as Israel’s lack of postwar plans and the harm to civilians in Gaza. Similar concerns will likely persist if Americans elect a new Democratic president. Biden earlier this year froze the delivery of certain bombs over fears they would be used in Israel’s incursion into the southern Gaza city of Rafah, which at the time sheltered more than half of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million. The U.S. abstained from a United Nations Security Council vote in March that called for a cease-fire and the release of hostages but did not link the two. Netanyahu called the decision a “retreat” from a “principled position” by Israel’s ally. Biden has had to walk a fine line of his own. He has faced harsh criticism from progressive Democrats and many Arab Americans. Even Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, the highest-ranking elected U.S. Jewish official, lambasted Netanyahu in March for his handling of the war. Some Democrats will likely demonstrate their anger toward Biden and Netanyahu by skipping Wednesday’s speech. Netanyahu is also likely to be hounded by pro-Palestinian activists during his trip. The last time Netanyahu spoke to Congress in 2015 was at the invitation of the Republican Party. The trip drove Israeli-American politics deep into the partisan divide as Netanyahu railed against then-President Barack Obama’s Iran nuclear deal. Netanyahu has not shied away from making Israel a partisan issue. With his nationalist conservative ideology, he has been perceived as throwing his support behind Republican candidates in the past, rankling Democrats and Israelis who want to keep the U.S.-Israel relationship bipartisan. It’s unclear if he will meet Trump. If there is a meeting, it could expose Netanyahu to accusations that he is once again taking sides. But if he doesn’t meet with Trump, the former president could feel slighted. The speech also offers Netanyahu opportunity. He will be able to show Israelis that despite the tensions with the Biden administration, U.S. support for him remains ironclad. “He wants the Israeli public to believe that he is very much still very welcome in the United States. And this shows that the American people are with him,” said David Makovsky, director of the program on Arab-Israel Relations at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. For critics of Netanyahu, that embrace is unacceptable and grants legitimacy to a deeply polarizing leader whose public support has plummeted. Netanyahu faces widespread protests and calls to resign over the failures of Oct. 7 and his handling of the war. In a letter to Congress, 500 Israeli writers, scholars and public figures expressed their dismay over the invitation to Netanyahu, saying he will use the platform to advance misguided policies that align with his far-right governing partners. “His only interest is preserving his own power,” they wrote. “Does the United States Congress wish to support such a model of cynical and manipulative leadership in these times?” Israeli media reported that Netanyahu will be joined by rescued hostage Noa Argamani and her father. But for many of the families of hostages held in Gaza, the trip is an affront. “This is not the time for trips,” Ayelet Levy Shachar, whose daughter Naama was kidnapped on Oct. 7, told reporters. “Netanyahu: First a deal, then you can travel.” Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

There is no middle ground.” On Sunday afternoon, Biden formally announced that he was jumping out of the 2024 presidential race, prompting more Republicans to jump on the bandwagon in questioning his fitness to remain in office. House Speaker Mike Johnson claimed in a statement that “if Joe Biden is not fit to run for President, he is not fit to serve as President.” “He must resign the office immediately. November 5 cannot arrive soon enough,” he charged. Montana Senator Steve Daines said he was “formally calling” on Biden to resign, insisting that if he’s “no longer capable of running for reelection, he is no longer capable of serving as President.” And GOP Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina posted, “If Joe Biden does not have the cognitive ability to seek reelection, he does not have the cognitive ability to serve the remainder of his term. Tomorrow I will introduce a resolution calling on Kamala Harris to invoke the 25th amendment and assume the duties of acting President.” Meanwhile, former Democratic congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, who has since shifted her allegiance to the GOP, contended that Machiavellian forces forced Biden’s decision, claiming, spuriously, on X that Vice President Kamala Harris “is the new figurehead for the deep state and the maidservant of Hillary Clinton, queen of the cabal of warmongers. They will continue their efforts to engulf the world in war and taking away our liberty.” To be sure, Biden didn’t drop out because he copped to being unfit, but, rather, he dropped out in the face of pressure from his own party, which did not believe the 81-year-old president had the public support to beat Trump in November. The internal backlash against a Biden re-election run gained steam after the commander-in-chief’s disastrous debate performance against Trump, the twice-impeached former president who has since been convicted by a New York jury on 34 counts of falsifying business records, been found civilly liable for rape by a second set of Big Apple jurors, and is still facing multiple federal and state charges—although a recent Supreme Court decision has temporarily thrown a wrench into the works—over allegations involving his attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Following an assassination attempt last weekend which led to reports that Trump might soften his tone after a near-death experience, the ex-POTUS took to Truth Social to take a series of ugly swipes at Biden, calling him “crooked” and claiming he “was not fit to run for President, and is certainly not fit to serve — And never was!” “We will suffer greatly because of his presidency, but we will remedy the damage he has done very quickly,” Trump wrote. “MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” In response to the news that Biden had stepped aside and endorsed Harris, Trump’s most rabid fans quickly flooded the internet on Sunday to express their concurring opinions. A credulous Elon Musk—who recently pledged $45 million a month to get the 45th president reinstalled as the 47th—began posting and reposting on X. “My smartest friends, including those living in the San Francisco Bay Area who have been lifelong Dems, are excited about Trump/Vance,” Musk wrote in one post, without naming names. Conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer jumped into the fray, floating the absurd notion that Trump’s recent shooting, which bloodied his ear but did not do any significant damage, was a plot by anti-Trumpers in positions of power. “And just like that, the media stopped talking about the Trump assassination attempt,” Loomer posted on X. “Do you not see what is happening? This is all planned to cover up the Deep State’s plot to kill Trump under Biden. We need accountability. We can talk about the Dysfunctional Democrat party later.” Others piled on, feigning outrage about Harris’ record while continuing to take disingenuous shots at Biden. Donald Trump Jr., the ex-president’s adult son, posted, “Kamala Harris owns the entire leftwing policy record of Joe Biden. The only difference is that she is even more liberal and less competent than Joe, which is really saying something.” And Lauren Boebert, the congresswoman recently escorted out of a theater performance in her home state of Colorado, claimed, “They set Joe up before the debate even took place. They forced him to do more interviews in the past 3 weeks than he has done in 48 years in office. Locking in the narrative, Joe’s puppet strings were slashed.” Conversely, former Rep. Liz Cheney, a Republican who chaired the House committee investigating Trump’s role in the Jan. 6, 2021, coup attempt, expressed her support for Biden’s decision to put country over party. “The framers of our Constitution knew that our republic would endure only if our presidents have the character and honor to put duty ahead of self interest,” she posted on X. “President Biden deserves our gratitude for his decades of service to our nation and for his courageous decision today.”","summary":"GOP pols and others on the right floated spurious claims about  the president’s fitness to remain in office following his announcement on Sunday that he would step aside","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/biden-republicans-gop-kamala-harris-b2583485.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/07/21/21/2162011564.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-21 23:52:07","author":"Justin Rohrlich","authors":["Justin Rohrlich"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.52},{"id":252300020,"title":"Kamala Harris expresses gratitude to Joe Biden and gains increasing support in 2024 presidential campaign","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris thanked President Joe Biden for his leadership following the news Sunday that he will not continue his bid for reelection. MORE: Live Updates: Campaign renamed to ‘Harris for President’ Her statement comes amid a growing chorus of endorsements for her candidacy in the 2024 presidential race. “On behalf of the American people, I thank Joe Biden for his extraordinary leadership as president of the United States and for his decades of service to our country,” she said in a statement released Sunday. Watch the ABC News special, “Biden Stands Down: The Race for the White House,” tonight from 7-9 p.m. ET on ABC and ABC News Live. “His remarkable legacy of accomplishment is unmatched in modern American history, surpassing the legacy of many presidents who have served two terms in office,” she said. Harris garners wave of endorsements Biden endorsed Harris in his statement on his exiting the race, offering his “full support and endorsement” for her to be the Democratic Party’s presidential nominee. At a July 11 press conference, Biden also hinted at his belief in Harris’ ability to lead, saying at the time: “I wouldn’t have picked her unless I thought she was qualified to be president.” In a poll released July 11, asking if Harris were to replace Biden as the nominee, vote choices were 49-46%, Harris-Donald Trump, among all adults (and 49-47%, respectively, among registered voters). Harris’ 49% was slightly better than Biden’s 46%, although she doesn’t have a statistically significant lead over Trump, the poll found. Former President Bill Clinton and former presidential candidate and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also endorsed Harris on Sunday. “We are honored to join the president in endorsing Vice President Harris and will do whatever we can to support her,” the two said in a statement on X.

I first came to know President Biden through his son Beau. We were friends from our days working together as attorneys general of our home states. As we worked together, Beau would tell me stories about his dad. The kind of father — and the kind of man — he was. And the qualities Beau revered in his father are the same qualities, the same values, I have seen every single day in Joe’s leadership as president: His honesty and integrity. His big heart and commitment to his faith and his family. And his love of our country and the American people.” Several notable figures abstain from immediately endorsing Harris Despite the wave of support from some Democratic figures, others did not immediately endorse Harris on Sunday. Former President Barack Obama did not mention Harris in his statement on Biden’s exit. Instead, he focused on his experience in the White House with Biden as his vice president: “Sixteen years ago, when I began my search for a vice president, I knew about Joe’s remarkable career in public service. But what I came to admire even more was his character — his deep empathy and hard-earned resilience; his fundamental decency and belief that everyone counts,” Obama said in a statement. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.Y., also did not mention Harris in his statement on Biden’s exit. “I cannot overstate the gravity of the noble and history-making decision that President Biden just made. The feeling that I have right now is one of profound gratitude,” Booker said. Texas Rep. Lloyd Doggett, who was the first House Democrat to call on Biden to step aside in the presidential race, back on July 2, applauded Biden’s decision but put the breaks on endorsing Harris. “Once again President Biden comes through for America, putting country over ego in a way that Donald Trump never could,” Doggett said, in part. He added, “While, with President Biden’s endorsement, Vice President Harris is clearly the leading candidate, we should be open to all talented individuals who wish to be considered.” Some donors express excitement Some Democratic donors who previously planned to withhold their campaign contributions told ABC News on Sunday that they are now excited to coalesce their support around Vice President Harris, even if she was not their first pick to replace Joe Biden at the top of the ticket “I don’t think that having some kind of bitter inner party fight over the nomination is going to help. If Biden is endorsing Harris, then I think that basically decides it,” said one donor who initially pledged to contribute more than $1.8 million to Biden before withholding their contribution over concerns about Biden’s viability as the nominee. Reacting to Biden’s decision to drop out of the race and endorse Harris, that same donor said they now plan to resume their pledged contribution to Harris. “I just texted Rufus Gifford,” the donor said, referring to the Biden-Harris campaign finance chair. “I told him I’m all in.” Another donor — who originally said that she planned to withhold her contribution and preferred an open convention — told ABC News that she now fully supports Harris following Biden’s withdrawal and endorsement. “I am convinced that 100% of us will get behind her,” said the donor, who previously held a fundraiser for Biden in her home. “Some people are getting their funds transfer information organized as we speak.” Some of the donors who spoke with ABC News were not enthusiastic about Harris compared to other Democratic politicians — including California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer — but described Harris as the inevitable nominee. “I can’t see how any other serious candidate could come out at this point and say, I’m running for the nomination against Harris,” another Democratic donor said.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nVice President Kamala Harris thanked President Joe Biden for his leadership following&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Kamala Harris expresses gratitude to Joe Biden and gains increasing support in 2024 presidential campaign first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/kamala-harris-expresses-gratitude-to-joe-biden-and-gains-increasing-support-in-2024-presidential-campaign/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ic_launcher.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-21 23:51:42","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.318},{"id":252300348,"title":"Kamala Harris Set to Take Over the Biden Campaign’s $96 Million War Chest","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris just inherited President Joe Biden’s $96 million campaign war chest. It only took a few hours for Harris to assume the Biden-Harris campaign’s finances and the president’s fundraising apparatus—including the key joint fundraising committees, the super engines behind presidential campaigns—in her newly launched presidential bid. They can only be used once the candidates from both major parties mathematically lock up their nominations. These are the vehicles through which Biden was raising major, high-dollar donations. The Biden campaign is now the Harris campaign, according to newly updated FEC documents. She also now helms the joint fundraising committees, whose names were changed from Biden Victory to Harris Victory on Sunday, according to other FEC documents. The same had not been updated for the Biden Action Fund, but Harris would have the same authority to inherit that one, too. The vice president had previously shared that authorized committee with Joe Biden as his running mate. “President Biden and Vice President Harris share an authorized campaign committee, and they’ve just amended the paperwork to drop Biden off the ticket and change the name to ‘Harris for President,\" campaign finance expert Brendan Quinn from the Campaign Legal Center told the Daily Beast shortly after the news broke. “This means that Harris now controls the $96 million in the former Biden-Harris campaign’s account,” he said, adding the move strikes him as “legally permissible.” However, where things get tricky is around Republican promises to hit what was formerly the Biden campaign with legal challenges. “GOP attorney Charlie Spies recently floated an argument in the Wall Street Journal that a strict textual reading of the FEC’s regulations would bar Harris from accessing these funds, but his reading is at odds with how the FEC has long interpreted its rules,” Quinn explained in an email. “Republican-aligned groups might file a complaint about this transfer,” he added, “but it is unlikely that any such complaint would be resolved before the election.” Should someone else become the nominee, then there’s a much higher likelihood that money would be frozen up upon a legal challenge, thanks to precedent in campaign finance law. Biden became the king of campaign cash once he was able to use his joint fundraising committee this year, as the Daily Beast previously reported. However, since Trump’s May guilty verdict in the Stormy Daniels hush-money trial, his campaign has seen a surge in donations, allowing him to rebound from a serious cash deficit. Yet the newly minted Harris campaign saw its own $8 million uptick in donations in the immediate hours after the news broke that Biden was stepping aside, according to the Daily Mail. Harris also locked up the immediate support of Biden’s top finance official on the campaign. “Let’s do this,” Rufus Gifford, the finance chair, posted on X. “The mission is clear and we are going to make history in 106 days by electing @KamalaHarri President of the United States.” In the most telling bit from his post, Gifford promised the money will all go to Harris if voters donate today. “Please give what you can today,” he added, “(money given here will be used 100% to elect Kamala Harris President).”","summary":"Kenny Holston/Getty ImagesVice President Kamala Harris just inherited President Joe Biden’s $96 million campaign war chest.\n\nIt only took a few hours for Harris to assume the Biden-Harris campaign’s finances and the president’s fundraising apparatus—including the key joint fundraising committees, the super engines behind presidential campaigns—in her newly launched presidential bid.

Grassroots voters will hope to be better served than they were during the initial nomination race, when Democrats put up no serious competition to the 81-year-old president's candidacy despite worries over his age. \"Remarkable leadership shown by Joe Biden. Now it falls to the (Democrats) to show equal leadership by having an open process to determine the best candidate(s) to take on Trump-Vance in November,\" said entrepreneur Andrew Yang, who ran against Biden for the party's nomination in 2020. \"The goal should be simple -- to win,\" he wrote on X. With Biden's endorsement, Vice President Kamala Harris, 59, starts out in the strongest position to replace him and may be able to consolidate support in the coming days -- a coronation that would allow Democrats to turn their fire on Trump. If that doesn't happen then a chaotic -- and potentially damaging -- fight for the votes of almost 4,000 delegates at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in just four weeks looks more likely. The party's national chairman Jaime Harrison promised a \"transparent and orderly process\" to replace Biden, the first president since Democrat Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968 not to seek a second term. Kamala the prosecutor His campaign began collapsing after his dismal debate performance against Trump last month prompted concerns over his advanced years and mental capacity. Trump, who would be 82 at the end of a second term, appeared more robust -- but opposition from a younger candidate would turn the spotlight on his speeches and interviews, where he often appears incoherent and confuses names. Several rising Democratic stars -- all younger than 60 -- have been floated as Biden alternatives, including governors Josh Shapiro, Gretchen Whitmer and Gavin Newsom. Whitmer immediately appeared to suggest she would not be running and Newsom has previously said he would not challenge Harris, but neither explicitly ruled themselves out. A campaign led by Harris and backed up by a moderate midwestern running mate could present the best chance for Democrats -- helping turn out more women, who historically vote in greater numbers than men and are a weakness for Trump. Harris would also give Democrats a chance to redefine the race at their convention as a clash of cultures between a former prosecutor and a convicted felon. \"While she has largely been in the shadows for the last four years it is time for Kamala the prosecutor... to make her comeback,\" said Sara Sadhwani, an assistant professor of politics at Pomona College in Claremont, California. A new survey from Democratic polling firm Public Policy Polling released Thursday found that Harris -- with the right running mate -- could defeat Trump and Vance in Pennsylvania and Michigan, two of the three \"Blue Wall\" states seen as critical to electing a Democratic president. Clean break? Ryan Waite, a political marketing expert from Brigham Young University-Idaho, told AFP a contested nomination might actually benefit Democrats by depriving Trump of headlines for several months. \"A new Democrat candidate will benefit from a short vetting window and significant earned media impact right before the election,\" he told AFP. \"The story is now who will it be and that will take the air out of the room through their convention.\" Any new nominee other than Harris would represent a clean break and be immune from much of the criticism directed at the Biden administration over high inflation, the border crisis and the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan. But while Harris would likely inherit all of the Biden campaign's cash reserves -- about $94 million as of July -- other candidates may have to share the money with down-ballot candidates. They would also have to make the case anew for endorsements from some of the Biden-Harris campaign's most influential backers, such as the United Auto Workers union. Harris herself could also face this problem, of course. Republicans have suggested that they might challenge any late substitutions in the courts but Marc Elias, the Democrats' top election lawyer vowed that the eventual nominee would be on all 50 state ballots. \"There is no basis for any legal challenge. Period,\" he said.

Our delegates are prepared to take seriously their responsibility in swiftly delivering a candidate to the American people.“ The comment reflected the reality that while Vice President Kamala Harris is emerging as the prohibitive favorite to become the party’s nominee — backed already by Biden and many Democrats — it’s not so simple. And for now, the party isn’t offering many details on what happens next. Harris has to formally secure the nomination from the around 4,700 Democratic convention delegates — including those pledged to Biden, as well as the elected officials, former presidents and other party elders known as superdelegates. She spent part of Sunday calling elected officials and delegates to solidify their support. Biden won Democratic primaries in every state, and Harris was on the ticket as his running mate. His tapping her as his successor while bowing out of the race further strengthens her case, as does the endorsements of party heavyweights like South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn. Many other Democratic leaders openly backed the vice president even before Biden left the race, urging him to “pass the torch” to her in the wake of his dismal debate performance against Republican nominee Donald Trump last month. “Folks will be weighing in and they should. I think we’re seeing a lot of coalescing behind the vice president,” said Rahna Epting, executive director of the progressive activist organization MoveOn. “And that’s important because, as we saw throughout the Biden debate fallout, there is momentum that can be built one way or the other, and it is important for us to build momentum toward unity.” Ken Martin, president of the Association of State Democratic Committees, which represents the 57 parties in the states and territories, said Harris was the obvious choice: “Having served alongside President Biden, she is ready on day one as a candidate and as our next president.” She was also endorsed by the executive council of the 1.75-million-member American Federation of Teachers union. But Democratic rules state only that delegates “in all good conscience” vote for the candidate they were elected to represent, with no mechanism for defectors. And some in the party have endorsed an open nominating process. There’s been active debate about how to proceed among lawmakers, major donors and former high-ranking officials of the Biden, Obama and Clinton administrations, a Democrat with deep ties to the Biden administration, said Sunday. The person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal conversations, argued that Harris would benefit from a competitive mini-primary ahead of the Democratic convention, because it would help her seal her bonafides as a strong candidate and diminish criticism that she’s been undemocratically anointed. That’s a charge the Trump campaign has already sought to use against her, and could loom large in the battle for undecided voters in battleground states. But such a scenario might leave Democrats heading into their national convention without a clear nominee, and perhaps choosing one via a series of floor votes. That could mean top Democratic candidates looking to replace Biden resorting to visiting individual state delegations to lobby — a process unseen since 1960, when Johnson and John F. Kennedy jockeyed for support during that year’s Democratic convention in Los Angeles. If that happened, in addition to Harris, many other leading Democrats who had endorsed Biden in 2024 while harboring their own presidential aspirations for future cycles could vie for the nomination, including California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and California Rep. Ro Khanna. Inside the White House, however, there’s low expectation that Harris will get a serious challenge, according to a person familiar with deliberations who requested anonymity to discuss the private conversations. Whitmer has already said she won’t run, and Newsom has said he would back Harris if she became the nominee. Others who have been mentioned as viable contenders — including Shapiro and North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper — have both endorsed Harris and would also seem unlikely to run in light of Biden’s endorsement of the vice president, and the expected fundraising advantage she would hold over anyone who’d enter the field. Further complicating matters is the fact that the DNC had planned to hold a virtual roll call to choose its nominee ahead of the convention, in order to meet Ohio ballot eligibility rules. That state’s original deadline ballot deadline was Aug. 7, and though the Legislature has since approved a law nullifying that, it doesn’t take effect until Sept. 1. DNC lawyers say that means the party could face legal challenges in Ohio if it fails to name their party’s nominee prior to the state’s original deadline. But the convention rules committee has said it won’t set a date for the virtual roll call — which could take place over several days — before Aug. 1. Some Democrats fear a host of other GOP legal challenges, including New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who had defended Biden staying in the race by arguing that replacing him might trigger “a presidential election being decided by Clarence Thomas and the Supreme Court” — like what happened during the 2000 presidential election and the disputed recount in Florida. At this week’s conventions rules committee meeting, members could establish virtual roll call rules and a process to nominate Harris. But they could also create a more open process for choosing a nominee, according to a person familiar with the process on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Harrison refrained from endorsing Harris in a statement, saying only, “In short order, the American people will hear from the Democratic Party on next steps and the path forward for the nomination process.” A somber Harrison also joined a virtual meeting of the convention credentials committee on Sunday, telling members, “I’m emotional.” “I still support my president,” Harrison said of Biden. “And we will get through this, my friends, as we always do.” ___ Associated Press writer Colleen Long contributed to this report.

On Sunday afternoon, Biden suddenly announced he was withdrawing the presidential election after weeks of pressure from within the Democratic party. He reflected on his presidency and how he fully intended to seek reelection. \"And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term,\" Biden said. Shortly after in a separate post to X, Biden endorsed Harris as the Democratic nominee to replace him on the ticket come November. It didn’t take long for voters to find a connection between Harris’s shot at the White House compared to the similar career of fictional character Selena Meyer from the comedy show VEEP. VEEP, which aired on HBO from 2012 to 2019, follows Meyer – played by Julia Louis-Dreyfus – throughout Washington as she serves as the first woman vice president after a failed presidential bid. In the finale of the second season, Meyer reveals to her team that her former running mate President Stuart Hughes would no longer be running for re-election, teeing her up to be the first woman president. Fans of the show shared the clip on X, pointing out the similarities between the fictional situation and the sudden change in the Democratic ticket. “This show. It’s always this show,” one X user wrote. “Veep is a reality show .. cuz Selina Meyer IS Kamala Harris,” another said. “It is WILD how much Kamala’s journey is turning out to be like Selina’s in VEEP,” a third chimed in. Several went on to claim that VEEP appeared to be predicting the future in a fashion similar to that of The Simpsons, which is notorious for seemingly predicting future events. “This is Dems Simpsons,” one user said. “Other than the Simpsons, no show has predicted real-life events like Veep has,” another wrote. “What’s unfolded in politics the last 8 years is insane and we watched it play out on TV first. Crazy.” Despite the comparisons between Harris and Louis-Dreyfus’ character, the creators of VEEP are not fully convinced the two are similar. Earlier this month, showrunner David Mandel told Vanity Fair that there are comparisons to be made for every political candidate worldwide, not just those who happen to be women. “I understand that people all over the internet are dying to make the narrative somehow that Kamala is Selina,” Mandel said. “I personally choose not to accept it. It’s too simplistic, and I don’t think they’re doing it in a fun way. “I think they’re doing it to try and somehow make her seem less than, and I don’t enjoy it.” SEEKING NOMINATION Harris has confirmed she intends to seek the Democratic nomination for president in the coming weeks. In a statement, the vice president said she was \"honored\" to receive Biden's endorsement as he steps away from the race. “With this selfless and patriotic act, President Biden is doing what he has done throughout his life of service: putting the American people and our country above everything else,\" Harris said. “I am honored to have the President’s endorsement and my intention is to earn and win this nomination. \"Over the past year, I have traveled across the country, talking with Americans about the clear choice in this momentous election. And that is what I will continue to do in the days and weeks ahead. She continued, \"I will do everything in my power to unite the Democratic Party—and unite our nation—to defeat Donald Trump and his extreme Project 2025 agenda.\" The Democratic Party is schedule to formally elect a candidate during the Democratic National Convention in Chicago beginning August 19.","summary":"","url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/29379660/veep-kamala-harris-joe-biden/","image":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/bn-veep-op.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-21 23:48:47","author":"Callie Patteson","authors":["Callie Patteson"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.092},{"id":252300024,"title":"Biden does not plan to resign presidency — White House","text":"WASHINGTON, July 22./TASS/.

Most Democrats have already united behind the vice president as the nominee, but others have also said the party needs an open convention. Barack Obama has called for an ‘open contest’ to chose Biden’s replacement, even though Harris maybe the only realistic contender A brokered convention is something the Democrats have not experienced in 70 years, and could sow chaos amid calls for all members to come together to defeat Donald Trump. Biden amassed nearly 4,000 pledged delegates committed to supporting him as millions of voters cast ballots for the incumbent president during the primaries. Biden’s seismic decision opens the door to a wild and a potentially exhausting nominating process next month at the convention with voting until a nominee is chosen by a majority of eligible voting delegates. A brokered convention is a presidential nominating convention where delegates fail to nominate a candidate on the first ballot. It means no candidate gets the votes of more than half of delegates in the first round. Once upon a time, brokered conventions happened regularly because the major parties did not hold primaries to award delegates the way they currently do. It lead to a series of complex negotiations playing out among some party power brokers, typically federal and state leaders including party officials, lawmakers and governors. The voting continues on a round of ballots until a candidate receives a majority of delegates. The last time there was a brokered convention was in 1952. In the end, Democrats were able to nominate Democrat Adlai Stevenson on the third ballot. Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower that year was just nine votes short on the first ballot, prompting some delegates to change their votes to make him the official nominee. The longest brokered convention to date took place 100 years ago in 1924 when Democrats took sixteen days and 103 ballots to nominate diplomat John Davis. It took Franklin Delano Roosevelt four ballots to secure the 1932 Democratic nomination. ‘We really don’t have any standards or benchmarks or known procedures,’ said Leonard Steinhorn, professor at American University, of what a brokered convention would look like in 2024. ‘We’re sort of walking a little bit in the wild right now,’ he said. While the terms brokered convention and contested convention are often used interchangeably, there is a key difference. A contested convention is one where the one candidate has done well but not enough to guarantee nomination on the first ballot, so another candidate tries to convince delegates to abandon the frontrunner. It has been more common in the modern era than a brokered convention, according to Elaine Kamarck from the Brookings Institute. When Biden was in the race, the convention was seen as a more of a public relations event for the party. But his decision to drop out opened the door for a process to choose someone to take the torch he passed on. Political parties have largely tried to avoid both brokered and contested conventions because history shows candidates who need multiple ballots to be nominated are less likely to win the White House. Of the sixty Democratic and Republican nominating conventions from 1868 after the Civil War through 1984, eighteen candidates were nominated on multiple ballots according to Pew. Of those, only seven were elected president, and among those, four were running against other nominees who also faced multiple ballots to receive the nomination. The last time a Democrat vigorously argued for an open convention was late Senator Ted Kennedy in 1980. The senator challenged President Jimmy Carter for the nomination. Ultimately, delegates had to stay faithful based on their state results when voting. But Carter went on to lose the election that fall to Ronald Reagan. Before that, Republican President Gerald Ford went into the 1976 convention with a clear majority of delegates but not a necessary number to lock up the nomination leading to a serious challenge from then-Governor Reagan. He ended up winning on the first ballot but went on to lose the election to Carter. ‘You want a party united behind the person who seems to be the popular choice of the members of that party, of the voters,’ Steinhorn noted. Determining the candidate at the convention would force the party and campaign to scramble to introduce the nominee to the public, raise money and hit the campaign trail before Election Day. What could benefit Democrats if they do hold a brokered convention in 2024 is their opponent is Trump. ‘This is going to be an unusual year because Donald Trump has very, very high negatives,’ said Steinhorn. While Democrats would be playing catchup for November in their messaging and ground game, there could be a key difference. ‘Because Donald Trump is so singularly unpopular as the opposing party nominee, it potentially does give the Democratic Party is small advantage,’ he added.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nPresident Joe Biden has dropped out of the presidential race and has&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Navigating an Open Convention: Potential Pitfalls for Kamala Harris and the Democrats in the 2024 Election first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/navigating-an-open-convention-potential-pitfalls-for-kamala-harris-and-the-democrats-in-the-2024-election/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/07/22/00/86891119-13596809-Biden_speaking_nearly_four_years_ago_on_the_fourth_day_of_the_De-a-21_1721603227916.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-21 23:45:30","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.284},{"id":252300722,"title":"Ed Markey predicts ‘electrifying impact’ from Kamala Harris campaign after Biden drops out","text":"BOSTON (WHDH) - Sen. Ed Markey said he expects to see an “electrifying impact on the Democratic base” as Kamala Harris ramps up her presidential campaign after President Joe Biden on Sunday ended his bid for another term. Speaking with 7NEWS after Biden’s announcement, Markey lauded the president and his accomplishments since he took office in 2020. “President Biden has helped save Democracy and our planet,” Markey said. “He has an unmatched record and I think we should all be grateful for his service. It has been a historically great presidency and it’s going to continue for the next six months.” Markey then praised Harris, saying she is “battle tested.” “She’s ready to serve and I think she’s going to have a magnetic, electrifying impact on the Democratic base in our country,” Markey said. Markey said he also expects to see an impact on voters who care about abortion rights, “taking on the NRA,” and supporting democracy. Markey won his first Congressional election in 1976, while Biden was still in his first term in the Senate. Most recently, he was in Provincetown Saturday for a fundraiser for the Biden-Harris campaign. Harris headlined the event and drew an excited response from attendees, according to Markey. “I was with her,” Markey said. “I witnessed it. And I think it’s going to happen community after community all across our country beginning tomorrow.” Harris left Cape Cod Saturday afternoon. She confirmed she is running for president shortly after Biden’s announcement Sunday and quickly earned endorsements from a swath of Democrats, beyond Biden. Markey said he is “100% with Kamala Harris” and said he thinks she will be “an historically great candidate.” “I think there’s a recombinant political DNA that she is going to bring to this candidacy that is going to have the Republicans back on their heels immediately,” he said. “I look forward to attending her inauguration in January,” he later added. While Harris surged as a favorite to follow Biden atop the Democratic ticket, she will still need to secure the nomination through a vote by Democratic National Committee delegates. A handful of other Democratic names have been put forward before and after Biden’s announcement, including California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Pennsylvania Gov.

Manchin had previously weighed a third party presidential run, but is now considering a run for the Democratic nomination, a source familiar with Manchin’s thinking confirmed to the Washington Examiner. The West Virginia senator, who registered as an independent earlier this year after previously being a registered Democrat, called on Biden to “pass the torch to the new generation” on CNN’s State of the Union on Sunday prior to Biden’s announcement that he would drop his campaign. When asked on State of the Union about how Biden would “pass the torch,” Manchin said on the network it should be an “open process.” “I think that we have a lot of talent on the bench, a lot of good people, and I’m partial to governors, because a governor can’t afford to be partial. They can’t afford to be partisan strictly, because that pothole or that bridge doesn’t have a D or an R on it,” Manchin said on CNN. “I have got two tremendous governors right next door to me, in Andy Beshear in Kentucky and Josh Shapiro in Pennsylvania, who are operating with legislatures evenly split or completely opposite of their party affiliation,” he added. “They haven’t divided their state. They haven’t made you pick a side and demonize the other side. They have brought people together. This is what an open process would do, I think. It would bring more people out in a process that could bring Democrats like me back.” Manchin, a Senate centrist, declined to run for reelection to his seat in November, but has not publicly ruled out running for public office in the future. Biden endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to be the Democratic nominee. Harris has the backing of several key Democrats, including Biden, Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-SC), and both Bill and Hillary Clinton, but several other Democrats have not endorsed her – including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and former President Barack Obama.

President Biden’s decision has a striking resemblance to the events of 1968, when President Lyndon Johnson declared in late March that he would not seek reelection. His vice president, Hubert Humphrey, received enough support among delegates to secure the nomination at the party’s convention in August 1968 in Chicago. Now, all eyes will be on Vice President Kamala Harris, who has secured the president’s endorsement to be the nominee. “I think there‘ll be a lot of talk over the next 48 hours over who the potential candidate could be, and you’ll hear some names be floated,” David Carlucci, a Democrat strategist and former New York state senator, told The Epoch Times. “But I think that any serious contender is going to recognize that it’s going to be hard to beat Kamala Harris in this convention and that they might try to position themselves for the vice presidential pick.” Some of those names include California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, former First Lady Michelle Obama, and Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear. “This battle right now is for the middle, for those few percent of people that are still undecided,” Mr. Carlucci said. “And I think having Kamala Harris there now gives them the opportunity to really energize a new group of people and get those few extra votes that we need in those swing states to win the elections.” According to political strategist Christopher Bruce, the next couple of weeks would be extremely “unpredictable” because nothing like this has happened since 1968. “Democrats need to take a page out of Republicans’ book and become united,” he said. “It is no longer the general public or even general Democrats who are going to elect their nominees—now, it goes toward the delegates,” Mr. Bruce said. The candidate must secure a majority of the approximately 4,000 delegates in Chicago. Now that President Biden has withdrawn from the race aside, the delegates are no longer pledged to vote for him. “That means there’s an open convention. Even though he’s endorsing Kamala Harris, that still means that these delegates can vote for whoever they would like,” Mr. Carlucci said. It could be a process in which, if there are multiple candidates, if one does not receive a majority on the first ballot, they will advance to the second ballot, he added. And if that happens, this would be the first time the party’s convention goes to a second ballot to determine its nominee since 1952. “I don’t predict there being a battle. I think it’s going to be Democrats rallying behind Kamala,” Mr. Carlucci said. Mr. Bruce agreed and said if Ms. Harris is passed over, “there’s going to be a lot of upset people in the black community.” The Biden–Harris campaign recently disclosed having more than $91 million in funds on hand, which could not be used to support a candidate other than Ms. Harris. While this is not a huge concern for the party, it might still present a challenge for other candidates. “Biden–Harris is a different legal entity,” said Mr. Bruce, who is also an attorney. “There’re definitely ways to get around it. I would say that it would not be easy.”","summary":"President Biden's decision has a striking resemblance to the events of 1968, when President Johnson declared in late March he would not seek reelection.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/strategists-share-predictions-on-whats-next-for-democratic-party-5691211","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/07/21/id5691175-GettyImages-2159966599-LS-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-21 23:42:17","author":"Emel Akan","authors":["Emel Akan"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.325},{"id":252299862,"title":"‘The Squad’ Is Coming Around to Kamala Harris for President","text":"Members of “The Squad” appear to be warming up to Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic presidential nominee, with several of the progressive lawmakers even issuing formal endorsements after President Joe Biden announced that he would not seek re-election—endorsing Harris himself on his way out the door.

His rival was riding high at the Republican convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Donald Trump had quite literally dodged a bullet. Well, almost. The bandage on his right ear was a constant reminder of how narrowly the former president had escaped death. We'd later hear from Trump's former doctor that the bullet came within a quarter of an inch of his head. That's about 6 millimetres. Joe Biden, meanwhile, just couldn't catch a break. His disastrous debate performance was deeply disappointing to his backers. To millions of Americans who tuned in that night, it was shocking. For those who've been paying attention Joe Biden's verbal stumbles and jumbled thoughts are part and parcel of his public appearances. In that sense there was some truth in the excuse he stubbornly held onto for so long that it was just \"a bad night\". When all is said and done, Biden's inner circle will have to ask themselves whether they too readily accepted that the president increasingly wasn't quite making sense and chose to shrug it off as just Joe being Joe. How the debate upended the race It was, of course, more than a bad night. It was a terrible night, which has changed the course of history. For weeks, the 81-year-old held on, offering a series of excuses for his performance: He had a cold, he was tired, he was jet-lagged, he didn't prepare properly, his staff over-scheduled him. All this, as some of the most senior party leaders began to signal that they no longer had his back. The former house speaker, party elder Nancy Pelosi, went on MSNBC to suggest the decision about whether to stand aside was Biden's to make, pointedly opening the door to him leaving after he had firmly closed it. Leaks emerged from the inner circles of Pelosi and former president Barack Obama that they had serious doubts he could win and the number of congressional Democrats openly calling on Joe Biden to stand aside started to snowball. The sight of the president gingerly making his way up the stairs of Air Force One after pulling out of campaign events in Nevada when he tested positive for COVID-19 only deepened concerns. Perhaps if he didn't fall ill, Biden would still not have pulled out of the race when he did. The split screen of a sick Joe Biden taken out of public view because of COVID while his rival strutted on stage at the Republican convention to chants of \"fight, fight, fight\" felt like the nail in Joe Biden's political coffin. He retreated to his home at his beloved Rehoboth Beach in Delaware, reportedly stewing and still insisting he was in it to win. But then it all changed and when the news came, it was shocking and surprising and yet neither of those things. Perhaps he'll take the time to write another memoir next year, detailing the backstory of this seismic moment and when exactly and how the fateful decision was made. Some will argue Biden waited too long to make the call, until he was literally forced into isolation by a virus that had defined the 2020 campaign and the start of his presidency. And yet there is an argument that he timed it just right. How the last few weeks help Harris In the weeks since the debate, there's been a slow but noticeable change in Democrats' messaging about Kamala Harris as some senior members of the party have appeared to coalesce around the idea that she might be their best chance when and if Biden dropped out. There are many arguments in favour of Harris leading the Democratic ticket. She is already essentially in training for the job, it's simpler for her to take over the campaign coffers, it avoids a messy open convention where the story is of party disunity, and it means that the Democrats are not accused of tokenism, in appointing a woman of colour as vice-president only to sideline her when she had a shot at the top job. There are signs that Kamala Harris's poll numbers are improving in the weeks since the debate Senators Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar have thrown their weight behind Harris, so too the powerful African American congressman Jim Clyburn of South Carolina. The Clintons are also all in for Harris, according to a statement the couple released soon after Joe Biden's announcement. And yet Obama has not endorsed Harris. In a statement, the former president spoke instead of \"a process from which an outstanding nominee emerges\". At this stage, Pelosi has also not thrown her considerable weight behind Harris. Unless they change their tune quickly, the inference here may be that they prefer an open convention next month, where Harris vies for the support of delegates alongside anyone else who puts their hand up. Notably, at least two of the possible contenders, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer and California Governor Gavin Newsom, have released statements reacting to Biden's decision, but did not endorse Harris. The vice-president herself has indicated she doesn't expect to be simply handed the keys. \"My intention is to earn and win this nomination,\" she said in a statement. The next days will determine whether other candidates put their names forward. But Harris, more than three weeks on from the disastrous debate, is in a much stronger position than she was in late May. A brutal few weeks Joe Biden prides himself on being human, as understanding the concerns and ups and downs of ordinary Americans. Watching him do so badly in the debate and then not appear to realise the gravity of the moment was, for many people, painful. It reminded us of watching elderly relatives in decline. Whatever your politics, there was something truly heart-wrenching about the indignity of it all. In dragging it out, Biden may have given his vice-president the best possible chance of being the Democratic nominee and taking on Trump If she succeeds, he will have finally come good on a promise he made in 2020: to be a transitional president. That could be his greatest legacy.","summary":"Whatever your politics, there was something truly heart-wrenching about the indignity of the last few weeks.

Harris quickly secured crucial endorsements from several influential congressional caucuses and Democratic lawmakers, as well as from party officials in key battleground states that Democrats can’t afford to lose to Donald Trump in November. Meanwhile, some Democratic National Committee delegates are already committing their support to Harris, who is expected to enter the party’s convention in August with a sizeable number of pledges. The president endorsed Harris for the presidency as he announced he was ending his re-election campaign on July 21. The chair of the Democratic National Committee issued a statement shortly thereafter promising a “transparent” process to select the nominee. By that afternoon, Harris’s just-launched campaign and her allies were calling prominent members of Congress and DNC delegates in an effort to secure her nomination before the convention in August. Among her first calls was to Congressional Progressive Caucus chair Pramila Jayapal, who said she is “1000% in for her to be our President.” Harris also secured endorsements from the Congressional Black Caucus and the chairs of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus. A group of current and former DNC members also began circulating a letter that by press time had collected more than 60 signatures urging members and voters to support Harris. During an afternoon conference call, Tennessee’s 77 DNC delegates voted unanimously to endorse Harris as the party’s nominee, becoming the first DNC delegates of any state to do so. Memphis Mayor Paul Young, expected among Tennessee’s delegates at the convention, said that Biden’s decision to leave the race “shows that he is willing to continue to do what is in our best interest as a nation, and that is to allow a path for Kamala Harris to become the next president of the United States.” Wisconsin Election Commission chair Ann Jacobs, who is one of Milwaukee’s eight DNC delegates from the key swing state, also announced she is joining all of those delegates to back Harris. More than a dozen delegates from Michigan, another major electoral battleground, have also announced their support for Harris. And Georgia’s Democratic Party chair Nikema Williams said the state “stands firmly behind Vice President Harris.” Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, widely speculated as a potential running mate, also quickly offered his support to Harris’s campaign: “I will do everything I can to help elect Kamala Harris as the 47th president of the United States.” “She has what it takes to defeat Donald Trump and lead our country thoughtfully and with integrity,” said North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, another speculated pick for Harris’s running mate. “I look forward to campaigning for her as we work to win NC up and down the ticket.” Harris also nabbed a key endorsement from the American Federation of Teachers, the nation’s second largest teacher’s union, within hours of her candidacy. The Human Rights Campaign, the nation’s largest LGBT+ civil rights group, also has endorsed her campaign. Abortion rights groups including Emily’s List and Reproductive Freedom for All have also reportedly been reaching out to delegates to back Harris, as Harris’s campaign looks to shift significant focus towards Republican threats to abortion access in the wake of Roe v Wade’s collapse. Biden’s campaign — now “Harris for President” — and the team and campaign infrastructure are moving forward around Harris, campaign co-chair Jen O’Malley Dillon and campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez told staff on Sunday. Harris will need support from at least 1,969 of the 3,936 Democratic delegates during the August convention to secure her nomination. But other party leaders, including Barack Obama and former House speaker Nancy Pelosi, have not yet endorsed a nominee in the wake of Biden’s departure, an apparent attempt to allow the nomination process to play out and allow candidates to duke it out to earn the party’s nomination rather than a coronation-like event with Harris as a foregone conclusion.","summary":"Prominnent Democratic officials and delegates in key battleground states are already lining up their support","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/kamala-harris-delegates-dnc-endorsements-b2583486.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/07/22/00/2162344172.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/TICjWMCO-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-21 23:35:49","author":"Alex Woodward","authors":["Alex Woodward"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.152},{"id":252299934,"title":"Anthony Albanese pays tribute to ‘great friend of Australia’ Joe Biden","text":"The West Australian Perth Now Click to open navigation ‌‌ News Chevron Down Icon Breaking News Western Australia National World Technology Opinion Weather Sport Chevron Down Icon AFL Cricket Soccer Basketball Tennis NRL Rugby Motor Racing MMA Golf Netball Cycling Entertainment Chevron Down Icon Confidential Movies Best Short Film Television Music Reviews Books Competitions Business Chevron Down Icon Breaking News Economy Markets Property Commercial Property Workplace Matters Lifestyle Chevron Down Icon Food Personal Finance Health Parenting Fashion Travel Home & Garden Relationships Stars Real Estate HUH?

Breaking from his annual leave, the Prime Minister said Mr Biden’s decision was another example of him acting in “what he considers to be the best interests of the United States of America”. Mr Albanese recounted his meetings with Mr Biden over the past two years, saying he had been a “great friend of Australia” and that he looked forward to seeing the outgoing President at upcoming summits before his January retirement. “President Biden deserves today to be recognised for once again not putting himself first, but giving his first consideration to what he believes is best interests of the United States, as he has done his whole public life,” Mr Albanese said. “President Biden has been a great friend of Australia... I pay tribute to him today.” In announcing his decision to step aside, Mr Biden endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to replace him as the Democratic presidential nominee. “It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President,” he said in his statement. “And while it has been my intention to seek re-election, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.” Mr Biden, who is isolating at home with Covid-19, said he would make a public statement later this week.

The unprecedented announcement, delivered less than four months before the election, immediately upended a campaign that both political parties view as the most consequential in generations. The president — intent on serving out the remainder of his term in office — quickly endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to take on Trump and encouraged his party to unite behind her, making her the party’s instant favorite for the nomination at its August convention in Chicago. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, nominated by Biden in late 2020, praised Biden as “an extraordinary guardian of America’s national security” in a statement Sunday. “I am deeply grateful for his leadership and statesmanship,” Austin said. “He has a secure place in American history as one of our great foreign-policy presidents.” Biden’s Sunday announcement is the latest jolt to a tumultuous campaign for the White House, coming a week after the attempted assassination of Trump at a Pennsylvania rally. A party’s presumptive presidential nominee has never stepped out of the race so close to the election. President Lyndon Johnson, besieged by the Vietnam War, announced in March 1968 that he would not seek another term after just a single state’s primary. Biden’s July decision comes after more than 14 million Democrats cast votes supporting him through the primary process. Harris, in a statement, praised Biden’s “selfless and patriotic act” and said she intends to “earn and win” her party’s nomination. “I will do everything in my power to unite the Democratic Party — and unite our nation — to defeat Donald Trump and his extreme Project 2025 agenda,” she said. Biden’s decision to bow out came after escalating pressure from his Democratic allies to step aside following the June 27 debate, in which the 81-year-old president trailed off, often gave nonsensical answers and failed to call out the former president’s many falsehoods. “It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President. And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term,” Biden wrote in a letter posted Sunday to his X account. Nearly 30 minutes after he delivered the news that he was folding his campaign, Biden threw his support behind Harris. “Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year,” he said in another post on X. “Democrats — it’s time to come together and beat Trump.” There were early signs that the party was moving to coalesce around Harris, who scored the endorsements of the Congressional Black Caucus and former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton even before she had commented on Biden’s decision to quit the race. But notably, former President Barack Obama held off, pledging support behind the eventual party nominee. “We are honored to join the President in endorsing Vice President Harris and will do whatever we can to support her,” former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in a statement. But Obama, who had privately shared doubts about Biden’s reelection chances, stopped short of endorsing Harris even as he praised Biden for his decision to leave the race. “I have extraordinary confidence that the leaders of our party will be able to create a process from which an outstanding nominee emerges,” he said in a statement. Biden’s decision came as he has been isolating at his Delaware beach house after being diagnosed with COVID-19 last week, huddling with a shrinking circle of close confidants and family members about his political future. Biden said he would address the nation later this week to provide “detail” about his decision. Harris found out about Biden’s plans on Sunday morning and senior campaign and White House staff were notified just minutes before the letter went out, according to people familiar with the matter who commented on the private discussions on condition of anonymity. Biden had been reflecting on his future for the past couple days and the decision was closely held. Now, Democrats have to urgently try to bring coherence to the nominating process in a matter of weeks and convince voters in a stunningly short amount of time that their nominee can handle the job and beat Trump. And for his part, Trump must shift his focus to a new opponent after years of training his attention on Biden. The decision marks a swift and stunning end to Biden’s 52 years in electoral politics, as donors, lawmakers and even aides expressed to him their doubts that he could convince voters that he could plausibly handle the job for another four years. Biden won the vast majority of delegates and every nominating contest but one, which would have made his nomination a formality. Now that he has dropped out, those delegates will be free to support another candidate. Harris, 59, appeared to be the natural successor, in large part because she is the only candidate who can directly tap into the Biden campaign’s war chest, according to federal campaign finance rules. Biden’s campaign formally changed its name to Harris for President, reflecting that she is inheriting his political operation — a sign of the leg up she has in the race for the Democratic nomination. Democratic groups, including the Democratic National Committee, also filed paperwork changing the names of their joint fundraising committees to reflect Harris’ candidacy. The Democratic National Convention is scheduled to be held Aug. 19-22 in Chicago, but the party had announced it would hold a virtual roll call to formally nominate Biden before in-person proceedings begin. It remained to be seen whether other candidates would challenge Harris for the nomination. The Democratic National Committee’s chair, Jaime Harrison, said in a statement that the party would “undertake a transparent and orderly process” to select “a candidate who can defeat Donald Trump in November.” Harris was spending Sunday afternoon calling Democratic elected officials and delegates as she works to lock up the nomination. Harris received her first delegates for the Democratic presidential nomination on Sunday. The Tennessee Democratic Party posted on X that its delegation voted during a meeting Sunday to back Harris after Biden’s departure from the campaign. Trump reacted to the news in a post on his Truth Social site, in which he said Biden “was not fit to run for President, and is certainly not fit to serve.” “We will suffer greatly because of his presidency, but we will remedy the damage he has done very quickly,” he added. “MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” While Trump and his team had made their preference for facing Biden clear, his campaign had nonetheless ramped up its attacks on Harris as pressure on Biden to step down intensified. Democratic officials, including many who were behind the effort to push Biden from the race, quickly released statements praising Biden’s decision. “His decision of course was not easy, but he once again put his country, his party, and our future first,” said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. “Joe, today shows you are a true patriot and great American.” House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York praised Biden as “one of the most accomplished and consequential leaders in American history.” Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said Biden should immediately resign if he is not fit enough to run for office. In a statement, Johnson said, “November 5 cannot arrive soon enough.” In addition to his planned address to the country, Biden still intends to host Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House this week, according to a person familiar with the president’s schedule who was not authorized to comment publicly. The exact timing of the meeting is still not set in stone as Biden continues to recover from COVID. Netanyahu is scheduled Wednesday to deliver an address to Congress and he is also expected to meet with Vice President Kamala Harris while in Washington. In 2020, Biden pitched himself as a transitional figure who wanted to be a bridge to a new generation of leaders. But once he secured the job he spent decades struggling to attain, he was reluctant to part with it. Biden was once asked whether any other Democrats could beat Trump. “Probably 50 of them,” Biden replied. “No, I’m not the only one who can defeat him, but I will defeat him.” Biden is already the country’s oldest president and had insisted repeatedly that he was up for the challenge of another campaign and another term, telling voters all they had to was “watch me.” And watch him they did. His poor debate performance prompted a cascade of anxiety from Democrats and donors who said publicly what some had said privately for months, that they did not think he was up to the job for four more years. Concerns over Biden’s age have dogged him since he announced he was running for reelection, though Trump is just three years younger at 78. Most Americans view the president as too old for a second term, according to an August 2023 poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. A majority also doubt his mental capability to be president, though that is also a weakness for Trump. Biden often remarked that he was not as young as he used to be, doesn’t walk as easily or speak as smoothly, but that he had wisdom and decades of experience, which were worth a whole lot. “I give you my word as a Biden. I would not be running again if I didn’t believe with all my heart and soul I can do this job,” he told supporters at a rally in North Carolina a day after the debate. “Because, quite frankly, the stakes are too high.” But voters had other problems with him, too — he has been deeply unpopular as a leader even as his administration steered the nation through recovery from a global pandemic, presided over a booming economy and passed major pieces of bipartisan legislation that will impact the nation for years to come. A majority of Americans disapprove of the way he’s handling his job, and he’s faced persistently low approval ratings on key issues including the economy and immigration. Biden’s motivation for running was deeply intertwined with Trump. He had retired from public service following eight years serving as vice president under Obama and the death of his son Beau but decided to run after Trump’s comments following a “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017, when white supremacists descended on the city to protest the removal of its Confederate memorials. Trump said: “You had some very bad people in the group, but you also had people that were very fine people on both sides. On both sides.” Biden’s wife, first lady Jill Biden, responded to the president’s announcement by reposting Biden’s letter announcing his decision and adding red heart emojis. Granddaughter Naomi Biden Neal said on social media, “I’m nothing but proud of my Pop.” She said he has served the country “with every bit of his soul and with unmatched distinction” and “our world is better today in so many ways thanks to him.”","summary":"Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin praised Biden for his \"profound and personal commitment to the Department of Defense and the American military\" on Sunday.","url":"https://www.marinecorpstimes.com/news/your-military/2024/07/21/biden-drops-out-of-2024-race/","image":"https://www.marinecorpstimes.com/resizer/nTmUSuszo0qC0YnUID7bQLk3iSw=/1024x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/archetype/TRV6BSKVUVA7BGYX45753BSLZE.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-21 23:33:18","author":"Geoff Ziezulewicz,The Associated Press","authors":["Geoff Ziezulewicz","The Associated Press"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.032},{"id":252299594,"title":"Maya Rudolph’s Best Moments as Kamala Harris on ‘SNL’ | Video","text":"When it comes to legendary impersonations on “Saturday Night Live,” Maya Rudolph’s triumphant returns to “SNL” as Kamala Harris are high on many “best of” lists. Though she left the show in 2007, Rudolph debuted the character during the 2020 election cycle in SNL’s impeachment town hall sketch, when she introduced herself as “America’s cool aunt. A fun aunt. I call that a ‘Funt.’” “The kind of funt that will give you weed but then arrest you for having weed,” she continued in the 2019 sketch, making a pointed barb at Harris’ record as an aggressive prosecutor. “Can I win the presidency? Probably not. I don’t know. Can I successfully seduce a much younger man? You better funting believe it.” Rudolph was back as Harris a month later. This time around, she tried her hand at re-creating viral memes — even in a pre-coconut-pilled world. December 2019 saw Rudolph return as part of the PBS Democratic Debate cold open just after Harris herself had dropped out of the race. Rudolph referenced Lizzo’s “Truth Hurts” when she said, “I just want to show you how good you could’ve had it, America. You withheld your donations, and I got tired of waiting, so I walked my fine ass out the door.” Rudolph then sang the words, “You coulda had a bad b–h.” Rudolph won an Emmy for her performance during the same sketch, which included a rap that begins at just over 7 minutes into the clip. “Look, when [Trump] gets to the Senate Judiciary Committee, he’s going to wish he’d never heard my name,” she began. “It’s pronounced ‘Kamala.’ It rhymes with ‘Pamela.’ It ain’t Camilla Cabello, it’s just Kamala.” Rudolph returned as Harris after the former rival was announced as Joe Biden’s running mate. In a first debate cold open from 2021, Rudolph-as-Harris chastised Chris Wallace for not moderating the debate the way she would have. “You know, look, I think if there’s one thing we learned tonight, it’s that America needs a WAP: Woman As President.”","summary":"The actress portrayed the presumptive presidential nominee several times in recent years, despite not being a regular \"Saturday Night Live\" cast member since 2007\n\n\nThe post Maya Rudolph&#8217;s Best Moments as Kamala Harris on &#8216;SNL&#8217; | Video appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/maya-rudolphs-best-moments-as-kamala-harris-on-snl-video/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/kamala-harris-snl.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-21 23:32:23","author":"Stephanie Kaloi","authors":["Stephanie Kaloi"],"language":"en","catgory":"entertainment","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.029},{"id":252299596,"title":"Biden’s BFF Chris Coons Weeps on Air Over Prez Quitting","text":"Sen.

Chris Coons (D-DE) praised President Joe Biden’s “brave” decision to drop out of the 2024 presidential race, appearing very emotional as he spoke. Coons, the co-chairman of the Biden-Harris campaign, made his statement while praising Vice President Kamala Harris, describing her as the best candidate to continue Biden’s work. The president himself has endorsed Harris as his replacement candidate, which was given shortly after he announced he was bowing out of the 2024 race. “I admire, I respect, I love Joe Biden,” Coons said on CBS News. “I have worked my heart out for him on this campaign, and while this was a very hard decision, I deeply respect how it is a continuation of his lifetime of putting our country before himself. Joe Biden is the toughest fighter I’ve ever met.” “Every time he’s been knocked down, he’s always got up again, and the challenge of seeing this moment and of recognizing what was in the best interest of the nation was a significant challenge. I still believe he could have beaten Donald Trump, but I also know that what he has done today is in the best interest of our nation,” he added. Coons continued by stating that former President Donald Trump poses a “unique threat” against the United States. He also contended that the focus now should be on the fall 2024 campaign and preserving Biden’s presidential legacy that he claims Trump could end. Later in the interview, Coons stopped speaking as he appeared visibly upset. He ended up continuing by adding that Biden’s “very difficult decision” to not seek reelection reflects his character. Coons had been one of Biden’s most vocal supporters since the first presidential debate, which saw many people issue calls for the president to drop out of the 2024 race. After George Clooney called for Biden to bow out, Coons joked that he was “more of a Matt Damon guy.” CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER In the wake of Biden bowing out, Coons has joined Biden in endorsing Harris as the Democratic Party’s 2024 presidential nominee. Trump wrote in his own statement about the news that the June 27 debate between him and Biden was “the big moment” in Biden’s demise, as this was when voters saw him as “an incompetent man who should never have been President.” The former president officially became the Republican Party’s 2024 presidential nominee at the Republican National Convention.","summary":"Sen.

Barbra Streisand, a Democratic supporter, wrote Sunday on X that “we should be grateful for his upholding of our democracy.” While many paid tribute to Biden’s presidency, others wondered about the future. Cher wrote on X that she was “tortured” because she doesn’t believe the Democrats could win without Biden. She said it was time to think “way outside the box” and proposed a split ticket. In recent weeks, several high-profile Hollywood names had begun calling for Biden to exit the race. Just weeks after headlining a record-breaking fundraiser for the president's reelection campaign, George Clooney wrote a New York Times opinion piece calling for Biden to end his bid. Clooney argued that the party should pick a new nominee, saying the process would be “messy” but “wake up” voters in the party’s favor. Others who attended or participated in the starry fundraiser in Los Angeles included Julia Roberts, Streisand, Jimmy Kimmel, former President Barack Obama, Jack Black, Sheryl Lee Ralph, Kathryn Hahn and Jason Bateman. Ralph, on Sunday, posted a photo of herself and Harris writing “President Biden has endorsed Kamala Harris!” Here are some notable celebrity reactions: Barbra Streisand “Joe Biden will go down in history as a man who accomplished significant achievements in his 4 year term. We should be grateful for his upholding of our democracy.” — via a post on X. Cher “In my heart im tortured, Because I Don’t believe the Democrats Can win the Presidency With”Pres Biden” “Joe” whom I’ve Loved since we met in 2008. I Campaigned for him I believe ITS TIME 2 PASS THE BATON. TIME 4 DEMS 2 THINK “ WAY” OUTSIDE THE BOX. MAYBE EVEN A SPLIT TICKET.” — via posts on X. Mark Hamill “@JoeBiden has a record of accomplishments unmatched by any president in our lifetime. He restored honesty, dignity & integrity to the office after 4 years of lies, crime, scandal & chaos. Thank you for your service, Mr. President. It’s now our duty as patriotic Americans to elect the Democrat who will honor & further your legacy.” — via a post on X. The “Star Wars” star visited Biden in the Oval Office in May, jokingly calling him “Joe-bi-Wan-Kenobi.” George Takei “I want to honor our President @JoeBiden. He has served our nation admirably for decades, he is a decent honorable man, a hugely successful president, and a patriot. Now let us unite behind @KamalaHarris and defeat Donald Trump in November!” — via a post on X. Russell Brand “Joe Biden has endorsed Kamala Harris for the Democratic nomination after ending re-election bid. We’re in a wild world, mate.” — via a post on X.
