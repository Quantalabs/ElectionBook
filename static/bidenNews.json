While the state requested to extend the program deadline to 2028, it didn't follow the proper federal rules for extension, U.S. Judge Lisa Godbey Wood ruled this week.Pathways has enrolled more than 4,300 Georgians in the program, and state officials previously said as many as 345,000 are eligible.In response, Georgia Governor Brian Kemp's office said they'd continue to work with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to maintain Pathways' viability.\"We are thankful that Judge Wood's ruling reaffirms what we have said all along—that the Biden administration's decision to revoke aspects of the Georgia Pathways program delayed its implementation, appropriately recognizing it as a 'bad act,'\" Garrison Douglas, a spokesperson for Kemp, told Newsweek.\"In accordance with the rest of her ruling, we will continue to pursue the necessary time to demonstrate the program's viability by working with CMS. Just as before, we remain committed to this Georgia-specific, innovative initiative that leads not only to health care coverage but to better opportunity and coverage options for those who enroll in the program.\"The Pathways program is unique from other Medicaid coverage in that it mandates recipients must work at least 80 hours a month or otherwise be involved in volunteer work, school or rehab.Pathways also sets a limit on insurance coverage to those who are able-bodied at the federal poverty rate of $15,060 for a single person.Biden got rid of the work requirement in 2021, but Georgia was able to win back its original rules in a lawsuit. However, that shortened the Pathways five-year deadline to a little more than two years.CMS already rejected Georgia's request for extension twice, saying the state hadn't met its rules for an extension request. Specifically, CMS requires a public notice and comment period.Wood reinstated Biden's ruling that Georgia did not meet the requirements and said the state was not allowed to \"now skirt the rules and regulations governing time extensions.\"\"If Georgia wants to extend the program beyond the September 30, 2025, deadline, it has to follow the rules for obtaining an extension,\" Wood wrote.Michael Ryan, a finance expert and the founder of michaelryanmoney.com, said the core issue between Georgia and the Biden administration has been procedural.\"Georgia failed to follow federal rules requiring public notice and comment for Medicaid changes,\" Ryan told Newsweek. \"The judge is essentially saying 'rules are rules,' even for state governments.\"If thousands end up losing health coverage because of the shorter deadline, Ryan predicts higher health care prices as more people delay care until they are in emergency situations.He also said countless families could go bankrupt because of unexpected medical bills without Medicaid.\"Low-income Georgians may now face impossible choices between health care and other necessities,\" Ryan said. \"This makes it not just a health issue but a financial stability issue, too.\"Georgia has options. It could reapply for an extension, following the proper procedures listed by Wood, consider full Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act or develop a new, less restrictive plan that could prompt faster approval, Ryan said.\"It puts recipients in a difficult situation, but, at the same time, it's hard to not put the blame at the hands of the state,\" Alex Beene, a financial literacy instructor at the University of Tennessee at Martin, told Newsweek.\"The good news is legislators in Georgia are saying there's still hope to work some deal out if they can move fast enough. The problem obviously is the government rarely moves quickly on anything, and that could open up thousands of recipients to losing coverage. If you're in this group, it's better to start assessing your options if no deal is worked out to extend coverage.\"Chris Fong, a Medicare specialist and the CEO of Smile Insurance Group, said the Pathways program, as it stands, has logic in its structure but \"leaves out many who direly need Medicaid.\"\"The judge seems to have denied the extension due to a procedural issue,\" Fong told Newsweek. \"It doesn't seem like Georgia is unable to correct the problem, but it will take time to go through the public notice and comment phase. If the Georgia Pathways program is not extended, then the 4,300 people enrolled will be pushed into getting health insurance elsewhere.\"","summary":"Joe Biden's administration previously denied Georgia's request to extend its deadline for part of the state's Medicaid program.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/thousands-could-lose-health-insurance-after-judge-ruling-1926117","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2429800/georgia-cdc.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-17 00:30:56","author":"Suzanne Blake","authors":["Suzanne Blake"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.132},{"id":251936440,"title":"Biden Goes to War With SCOTUS Amid High Court Ethics Scandals","text":"President Joe Biden is planning to announce major reforms to the Supreme Court in upcoming weeks, according to multiple reports.

But he also warns that late-campaign developments – in the form of an “October Surprise” – could complicate things down the stretch. “The map has expanded in a massive, massive way,” Eric Trump said in Milwaukee Tuesday. “The internal numbers are great. You’re seeing massive, massive shifts,” he added, noting that it’s not just states that are in play, but demographics nationally. “We’ve never done better with the youth vote than we are doing right now. We’ve never done better with the African American vote than we’re doing right now. That vote has moved by 20%. We’ve never done better with the Hispanic vote than we are doing right now. We’ve never done better with the Jewish vote than we’re doing right now,” Eric Trump said, before moving to states that the Trump campaign thinks it can win. Among them are Minnesota, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Nevada “In Nevada, we’re up by like 10%. We’re up by like 7% in Arizona. I would have never thought there was a time where your polls actually showed you higher in Nevada than they did in Arizona. I mean, Arizona is just incredibly red, but that’s actually how well we’re doing in Arizona. That’s how well we’re doing in Nevada.” RNC and Trump political director James Blair and pollster Tony Fabrizio offered similarly upbeat takes, saying that Minnesota, Virginia, New Jersey and New Mexico were all in play also, along with Maine. Blair confirmed that the “map is expanding,” meanwhile, and that the Trump side is optimistic that they can “outspend” the Biden campaign. They’re also confident that news events, including Saturday night’s assassination attempt on the former President, have “really galvanized our supporters and brought new supporters aboard.” “Joe Biden has spent $150 million in the battleground states,” Blair said. “And the numbers are going in the wrong direction.” Fabrizio noted that the media was late to understanding that Minnesota and Virginia were in play, chiding press for “playing catch-up” and not understanding “the level of enthusiasm our base has versus the level that Joe Biden’s base has.” “You’re writing as if North Carolina and Arizona are still toss-up states,” he said, saying that opportunities for GOP pick-ups exist in this electoral cycle that didn’t in 2016 or 2020. One thing to watch, he said, would be which marginal candidates made the ballots in which states. Still, Fabrizio said that many 2020 Biden voters have “buyers’ remorse,” and are simply too “disaffected” to vote Biden again. Ad buys focusing on abortion and Jan. 6, he added, have taken polling numbers in the “wrong direction” for the Biden campaign – despite a staggering $150 million in the bank to spend on messaging. “Right now on average, put my polls aside (and look at) public averages. We’re ahead by almost five points in Pennsylvania. We’re ahead by a little over six points in Arizona and coming up on seven points in Nevada. And by the way, that’s not counting in the undecideds that will break to us. So, you know, right now we have a pretty comfortable margin in those states,” Fabrizio said. Fabrizio is also bullish on Trump’s appeal to younger voters buckling under the pressure of the economy, since roughly 35% of them in target states have had to take “second jobs to make ends meet.” “Their memory is that the economy was doing much better and there was more opportunity,” Fabrizio added, referring to Trump’s presidency. Despite the positive polling, there was an acknowledgement that currently unforeseeable events could change the topography of the race. Eric Trump offered cautions, saying that it’s a certainty the Biden campaign will “cheat” and that a familiar late-campaign trope is bound to recur weeks before the election. “Guys, there’s gonna be an October surprise,” Eric Trump asserted. “I want to get the world prepared for the fact that the same game that they’ve played every single time, you know, the Democratic October Surprise, which is something that they spring on you, which is so sensational that it buries you, but it’s something that you don’t have enough time to disprove. So by the time it kind of gets through the media, it’s already done the damage that they intend to do, even if it’s not true.” Fabrizio echoed Eric’s sentiments, warning supporters that Dems “will do anything” to win.","summary":"The former president’s middle son is telling Florida Republicans that the electoral map has expanded and that certain key demographics are going Donald Trump’s way.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/07/16/us-news/eric-trump-bullish-on-internal-2024-polls-but-fretting-dem-october-surprise/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/newspress-collage-ppo3tigr9-1721175736340.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1721161386&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/gBKkWZrK-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-17 00:26:57","author":"A.g.

It's time for an important conversation in this country.\" \"Our politics has gotten too heated,\" he continued. \"As I've said in the Oval Office on Sunday night, as I've made clear throughout my presidency, we all have responsibilities to lower the temperature and condemn violence in any form. You gotta remember, in America we're not enemies, we're friends, we're neighbors.\" But Biden did not refrain from relentlessly criticizing the former president in his 30-minute speech, saying that \"just because you must lower the temperature … doesn't mean we should stop telling the truth of who you are, what you've done, what you'll do.\" Biden used Saturday's shooting to launch into a forceful condemnation of gun violence in America, nearly yelling when he cited the impact of gun violence on kids. \"You know, the pain, the price of violence. You understand if you're going to talk about standing against violence, you must stand against all violence,\" Biden said, addressing NAACP members, before listing off other notable acts of violence, including the killing of George Floyd, and the events of January 6, 2021. \"More children in America died of gunshot wounds than any other reason. That is stunning and that is sick,\" he later almost shouted. Biden appeared careful to focus on policy differences -- not calling Trump himself, as he has before, a \"threat to democracy.\" \"Just think about where the Black community was when I came into office. Think about how far the Black community has come. We still got a long way to go. COVID no longer controls our lives. Our economy has not figuratively, literally, the strongest economy in the world; historic low Black unemployment, record growth of black small business. Let me say this again, because Trump is lying like hell about it,\" he said. \"Black unemployment hit a record low under Biden-Harris administration.\" \"As Harry Truman said, 'I've never deliberately given anyone hell. I just told the truth and they thought it was hell,'\" Biden said. \"That's what I'm gonna do. Well, here's the truth about why Donald Trump's presidency was hell for Black Americans.\" The president cited Trump's efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, his tax cut which benefitted wealthy Americans, and his pandemic policies that Biden said were \"especially devastating to Black communities.\" Then, capitalizing on Trump's comment in last month's debate in which he referenced \"Black jobs,\" Biden said, \"Folks, I know what a Black job is: it's the Vice President of the United States! I know what a Black job is: the first Black president in American history, Barack Obama!\" as audience members roared in approval. In a notable comment amid some calls for him to step aside for someone else to lead the ticket, primarily Vice President Kamala Harris, Biden said of her, \"And by the way, she's not only a great vice president, she could be president of the United States.\" At one point, Biden took aim individually at Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, Trump's newly selected running mate, seeking to tie him, as he has done with Trump, to Project 2025. \"They're lying about their Project 2025. They want to deny your freedom: the freedom to vote, have your vote counted. They'd impose a nationwide ban on abortion. His new vice president, if you ever had any doubt, man, just take a look at what he's been saying,\" Biden said. \"They want to prosecute their political enemies, they want to cut Social Security and Medicare.\" Earlier in his remarks, though it's become the focus of his campaign's messaging in recent weeks, Biden flubbed his delivery of his anti-Project 2025 argument multiple times, at one point calling it \"this project of 2024\" and another \"their program on 2025.\" At another point, when announcing his administration's proposal to place a 5% cap on rent increases, the president seemed to have lost track of the teleprompter's words, pausing and leaning in before falsely saying the cap would be \"no more than 55 dollars.\" About two minutes later, Biden correctly said it was 5%. These flubs come as Biden's every comment under an intense microscope after last month's poor debate performance. Though focus on the president's age has taken a temporary backseat with the attempted assassination of Trump and the addition of Vance to the Republican ticket, Biden alluded to the difficult two weeks he has endured after his debate performance. \"Harry Truman was a president who was often counted out. He was also known for something else,\" Biden said. \"The story goes, Truman said, 'You want a friend in Washington? Get a dog.' Well, guess what? Last couple weeks – after the last couple weeks, I know what he means,\" Biden said. Biden has seen softening support among Black voters in recent polls, with Democrats fearing their base will sit out the election, but the attendees at Tuesday's event were largely in his corner, welcoming him with cheers of \"Four more years!\" Shavon Arline-Bradley, the president and chief executive of National Council of Negro Women, one of those who spoke ahead of Biden, said Black women were going to stay in engaged. \"In the spirit of Bethune and Height this morning,\" she said, referencing civil rights icons Mary McLeod Bethune and Dr. Dorothy Height, \"we are here to light under the feet of this country and say, 'not on our watch.\" \"Black women, we're going to do our part,\" Arline-Bradley continued. \"Black women, we're going to do our part to save democracy again. We're going to have women on the ballot, again. We're going to organize the voters again.\" Arline-Bradley later adding, \"And Black women we will never be silenced ever, ever, ever again.\"","summary":"He hit back his rival's claims and policies but avoided personal attacks.","url":"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-1st-major-speech-after-trump-shooting-accuses/story?id=111998836","image":"https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/89012f9d-716c-42f4-b85b-26b5eba413ca/biden-gty-jt-240716_1721170419719_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-17 00:18:15","author":"Fritz Farrow,Gabriella Abdul-Hakim,Will McDuffie","authors":["Fritz Farrow","Gabriella Abdul-Hakim","Will McDuffie"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.25},{"id":251935882,"title":"Spotlight on Usha Vance, Indian-American wife of Trump’s running mate","text":"MILWAUKEE, Jul 16 : Indian-American lawyer Usha Chilukuri Vance has burst into the national spotlight after her husband, JD Vance, was named by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump as his running mate. Usha, 38, would be the possible first Indian American second lady, if Trump and Vance win the November 5 general elections against incumbent President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. Usha joined her 39-year-old husband on Monday as he accepted the nomination in an acclimation vote by delegates — after the couple jubilantly greeted convention attendees. The daughter of Indian immigrants, Usha grew up in a San Diego suburb. Friends from her childhood and adolescence described her as a “leader” and a “bookworm.” As of 2014, she was a registered Democrat. Usha, a graduate of Yale Law School, is a civil litigation attorney at Munger, Tolles & Olson LLP. She has clerked for Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts. She also clerked for Justice Brett Kavanaugh while he was a judge on the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit. Usha and Vance met at Yale Law School where the two were studying. She would be the first Hindu spouse of a vice president — and would succeed second gentleman Doug Emhoff, who is the first Jewish spouse of a vice president, The New York Post reported. The Vance couple was married in 2014 in Kentucky and were blessed by a Hindu priest at a different event, according to a New York Times profile. The Vances have three children: sons Ewan and Vivek, and a daughter named Mirabel. Usha said she was reluctant to gain greater public exposure in a “Fox & Friends” joint interview with her husband last month, the Post reported. JD Vance’s successful 2022 Senate campaign was “an adventure,” she said, but “I’m not raring to change anything about our lives right now.” “But I believe in JD and I really love him, and so we’ll just sort of see what happens with our life — where we’re open,” she said in the interview. Vance said that his wife “is not a Christian” but was “very supportive” of his deepening faith, the report added. Asked about the challenges of an interfaith marriage, she said, “There are a lot of things that we just agree on, I think, especially when it comes to family life, how to raise our kids. And so I think the answer really is, we just talk a lot.” Prior to law school, she got a bachelor’s degree in history from Yale and a master of philosophy degree from the University of Cambridge. Usha has not appeared in many public events but has made some appearances on talk shows. On Monday, she was seen along with Vance on the floor of the Republican National Convention as part of the Ohio delegation. People said Vance tends to keep his children out of the spotlight, though he has made references to his children over the years.

Biden announced the changes during a Zoom call on Saturday, July 13 with members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. “I don’t want to prematurely announce it—but I’m about to come out with a major initiative on limiting the court,” Biden said, according to a transcript of the call viewed by the Post. The president said he was working with “constitutional scholars” for the last three months on possible changes to the high court—meaning Biden’s office was working on these changes before the Supreme Court’s controversial decision to find former President Donald Trump immune from criminal prosecution for “official acts” taken while holding the office. Biden strongly condemned the court’s decision on July 1, but declined to take questions from reporters at a press conference the same day. It is unclear exactly when Biden plans to announce this legislation to the public. The White House did not return a request for comment from the Daily Beast. Biden could be looking for momentum going into the Democratic National Convention in August, as members of his own party continue to pressure him to drop out of the race after a lackluster debate performance with Trump—who was officially named the Republican nominee on Monday. Biden’s push for term limits and an enforceable code of ethics for justices echoes criticism from Democrats after Justice Clarence Thomas failed to disclose lavish vacations to Bali and stays at a manor owned by billionaire and conservative donor Harlan Crow in 2019, which were first reported by ProPublica in 2023. Thomas finally acknowledged the trips in June, but claimed they were “inadvertently omitted” from his previous disclosure reports. Earlier in June, Justice Samuel Alito also came under fire for allegedly flying the “Appeal to Heaven” flag and an upside-down American flag at his homes in New Jersey and Virginia—both symbols used in recent years by far-right movements.","summary":"Kent Nishimura/AFP via Getty ImagesPresident Joe Biden is planning to announce major reforms to the Supreme Court in upcoming weeks, according to multiple reports.\n\nThe president plans to propose legislation that would enforce term limits on justices and a code of ethics for justices, The Washington Post reported, citing two anonymous sources familiar with the matter.\n\nBiden announced the changes during a Zoom call on Saturday, July 13 with members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.","url":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/biden-goes-to-war-with-scotus-after-clarence-thomas-and-samuel-alito-ethics-scandals","image":"https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_576,w_1024,x_0,y_39/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1721175265/GettyImages-2161709911_lddaez","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-17 00:15:44","author":"Zachary Folk","authors":["Zachary Folk"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.24},{"id":251935972,"title":"Biden faces ridicule for saying he’s been ‘very supportive’ of Palestinians","text":"Washington, DC – After the Israeli military bombed a school housing displaced people in central Gaza on Tuesday, a young man stood at the chaotic scene with a rocket fragment in his hand. “This is an Israeli American missile,” he said. “We were stepping on corpses. I cannot describe the cruelty of what is happening,” the man said in a video verified by Al Jazeera after the attack in the Nuseirat area, which killed 17 civilians and injured dozens. Such mass-casualty attacks have been a near-daily reality for Palestinians in Gaza for the past nine months. Officials and everyday people in the besieged territory have expressed outrage that the bombs decimating their lives are, in many cases, supplied by the United States as part of its alliance with Israel. After air raids in the al-Mawasi area of Khan Younis killed at least 90 Palestinians last week, the Gaza Government Media Office blamed the US directly for the attack. But US President Joe Biden has a different view of Washington’s role in the war. “I’m the guy that did more for the Palestinian community than anybody,” he said in an interview that aired online on Monday. “I’m the guy that opened up all the assets. I’m the guy that made sure that I got the Egyptians to open the border… I’m the guy that’s been able to pull together the Arab states to agree to help the Palestinians with food and shelter.” He added, “I mean, I’ve been very supportive of the Palestinians.” The US president’s assertion was met with ridicule by Palestinian rights advocates, who stressed that Biden’s unconditional support for Israel is fuelling a genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. “It’s hard to decide whether these comments by Biden were arrogant, blind or deceitful. It seems that he wants to take credit both for enabling the genocide and for letting Palestinians have a little bit of medicine and water and food,” said Amer Zahr, a Palestinian American comedian and activist. Lexis Zeidan, a Detroit-based Palestinian American organiser, echoed that criticism. “The only thing Biden did more for when it comes to Palestinians is increase their death toll with US-funded Israeli bombs,” she told Al Jazeera. Armed by the US, the Israeli military has killed more than 38,000 Palestinians in Gaza and levelled large parts of the territory. A self-proclaimed Zionist In the same interview with journalist Speedy Morman, Biden re-asserted that he identifies as a Zionist. “A Zionist is about whether or not Israel is a safe haven for Jews because of their history of how they’ve been persecuted,” he said. The president then went on to ask the interviewer whether he knows what it means to be a Zionist. Zionism is a Jewish nationalist ideology that emerged in Europe in the late 1800s, calling for the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine, where only a small minority of the population was Jewish at that time. While the ideology’s supporters present it as a form of self-determination, many Palestinian rights advocates argue that Zionism has led to the dispossession and ongoing subjugation and oppression of Palestinians. During the interview, Biden reiterated a position he often repeats while explaining his affinity for Israel: He claimed that Jews across the world would not be safe without the country. “If there weren’t an Israel, every Jew in the world would be at risk,” he said. Some activists say such remarks could be seen to perpetuate the anti-Semitic trope of “dual loyalty”: the idea that Jewish people must be loyal to Israel, whatever their background. Eva Borgwardt, national spokesperson at IfNotNow, a youth-led Jewish-American progressive group, slammed the president’s comment. “Many of us hear this repeated statement as a threat to our safety in this country. As president of the United States, it’s Biden’s job to make the US safe for everyone, including Jewish Americans,” Borgwardt told Al Jazeera in a statement. “If he wants to keep Jews safe, he should focus on combating the real and present danger of white nationalism, instead of sending more bombs for Israel to prolong its assault on Gaza, which has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and left hostages to languish in captivity.” US support for Israel Zahr, the Palestinian American comedian, also slammed Biden for insisting that he is a Zionist. “After nine months, he is still defiantly and proudly calling himself a Zionist. Well, in November, he’s going to see how that word makes us vote,” Zahr told Al Jazeera. Due to his unwavering support for Israel, Biden has struggled with key constituencies in the Democratic Party, including young people, progressives, and Arab and Muslim Americans. His electoral woes were exasperated after a disastrous debate performance in June, where he appeared exhausted and confused at times. While Biden and top officials in his administration often underscore their backing of Israel, the president played down that support during the interview with Morman. Ahmad Abuznaid, the executive director of the US Campaign for Palestinian Rights (USPCR), said Biden is claiming that he supports Palestinians because he understands that he has alienated voters in communities that support Palestinian rights. “And so he attempted to make himself an ally of the movement when, in fact, what he’s doing is supporting the genocide of our people,” Abuznaid told Al Jazeera. “At this moment, he’s arming it. He’s defending it. He’s supporting it. And that’s how Palestinian Americans perceive President Biden and these comments. The comments are offensive. They’re disrespectful.” Biden had boasted earlier this month that he is more popular in Israel than he is in the US. But when addressing the Arab vote with Morman, the US president falsely claimed that the US is only sending defensive weapons to Israel. “I denied them offensive weapons that they were using, 2,000-pound (907kg) bombs and the rest,” he said. While the US did stop a single shipment of 2,000-pound bombs to Israel this year, Biden administration officials have stressed that the transfer of other weapons has continued steadily on a regular basis. In April, Biden signed off on $14bn in additional US military aid to Israel. And the Pentagon confirmed this week that 500-pound (226kg) bombs that were part of the suspended shipment have been separated and released to the US ally. “Biden could stop this genocide today by turning off the tap of unlimited funds and weapons to Israel. But instead, he allows Netanyahu to do as he pleases, repeatedly calls himself a Zionist, and does what the emperor does — supports Israel unequivocally because Israel secures US interests in the Arab world,” said Hatem Abudayyeh, chair of the US Palestinian Community Network (USPCN). “If Biden is our saviour, then who out there is our enemy?”","summary":"US president says he has done more for Palestinians than anyone despite mounting death toll and destruction in Gaza.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/17/biden-faces-ridicule-for-saying-hes-been-very-supportive-of-palestinians?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2024-07-13T094931Z_1875345524_RC29U8AYBZ46_RTRMADP_3_ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-1721073219.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-17 00:12:54","author":"Ali Harb,Apps Support","authors":["Ali Harb","Apps Support"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":0.081},{"id":251935802,"title":"Matt Brooks from the Republican Jewish Coalition predicts that Donald Trump will support Israel and put an end to violent groups promoting anti-Semitism.","text":"MILWAUKEE, Wisconsin — Matt Brooks, the CEO of the Republican Jewish Coalition (RJC), told the Republican National Convention Tuesday evening that Donald Trump would stand with Israel and stop the antisemitic “mob.” Brooks spoke in a coveted prime-time slot in a year when Republicans are keen to emphasize Trump’s record of support for Israel, and his broader foreign policy success, with President Joe Biden’s failures in Israel and elsewhere. “Let me hear you cheer if you support Israel!” Brooks urged the crowd of delegates, drawing loud cheers. “Now, if someone tried that at the Democrats’ convention, they’d be booed off the stage,” Brooks continued. “But here, at the Republican convention, we proudly, and loudly, stand with Israel.” Republicans hope to capitalize on growing discontent within the Jewish community about Biden’s perceived lack of support for Israel in its fight against terror — and his apparent tolerance of antisemitism on campuses and in cities. “This election is a critical moment for the American Jewish community and for Israel. This is our chance to continue the incredible pro-Israel legacy of the most pro-Israel president in history — Donald J. Trump,” he said, to cheers. “They said [it] couldn’t be done. … He moved the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem. They said it couldn’t be done, but he weakened the Iranian regime. They said it couldn’t be done, but he delivered the historic Abraham Accords, bringing us closer to peace in the Middle East. With President Trump we will repair and rebuild the U.S.-Israel relationship that has deteriorated after four disastrous years under President Biden.” Brooks noted that Biden is still withholding some weapons from Israel — and the crowd booed. “There is only one pro-Israel party,” Brooks concluded, “and it’s the Republican Party. “And here at home, under Donald Trump, we will put a stop to the rising tide of antisemitism. President Trump will bring back law and order, so that American Jews can once again wear a kippah and walk the streets without fear. President Trump will stop the mobs on college campuses so Jewish students feel safe when they go to class.” He also said Trump would “stand up to the Hamas sympathizers and the Sqaud,” referring to anti-Israel Democrats in Congress. “Am Yisrael Chai!” he concluded, using a Hebrew rallying cry that means “The people of Israel live.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nMILWAUKEE, Wisconsin — Matt Brooks, the CEO of the Republican Jewish Coalition&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Matt Brooks from the Republican Jewish Coalition predicts that Donald Trump will support Israel and put an end to violent groups promoting anti-Semitism. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/matt-brooks-from-the-republican-jewish-coalition-predicts-that-donald-trump-will-support-israel-and-put-an-end-to-violent-groups-promoting-anti-semitism/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/07/Israeli-flag-Trump-RNC-Getty-1024x768.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-17 00:12:42","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.06},{"id":251936060,"title":"'Devastated' fans mourn Tenacious D's cancelled tour after Trump assassination joke","text":"Fans of Tenacious D are \"devastated\" the band has cancelled the rest of their Australian tour in the wake of a controversial onstage joke about the attempted assassination of former US president Donald Trump. Ben Parsons and his family travelled more than four hours from Armidale to Newcastle to see Jack Black's comedy rock duo in concert on Tuesday night. They found out through social media the event had been cancelled. \"We were devastated but my kids were devastated as well,\" Mr Parsons told ABC News Radio. \"[I've] been a fan of Jack Black for a long time, was looking forward to it. [I'm] definitely out of pocket a lot now.\" The band was scheduled to play shows in Melbourne, Brisbane and Adelaide. During a show in Sydney on Sunday night, Black asked bandmate Kyle Gass if he had a birthday wish. \"Don't miss Trump next time,\" Gass responded. Australian ambassador to the US and former prime minister Kevin Rudd said it made him \"physically ill\" to see someone joking about violence. \"I mean, people might think it's a bit of funny ha-ha at a concert to run off at the mouth about this stuff. It's not,\" he said. \"It's about the near-assassination of the former and prospective president of the United States … and it's about the murder of an innocent civilian and two people being seriously wounded.\" Mr Rudd spoke from the sidelines of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where Trump has been officially confirmed as the Republican presidential nominee. Black told his Instagram followers he no longer felt it was appropriate to continue the Tenacious D tour and said: \"All future creative plans are on hold.\" Ticketek will automatically refund ticketholders by for their purchase. In a statement, Gass said the line he improvised was \"highly inappropriate, dangerous and a terrible mistake\". He added that he did not condone violence of any kind. A growing number of Australian politicians have criticised the comment, which has provoked global outrage. Senior Liberal senator Anne Ruston told Channel Seven the comment was out of line and akin to inciting violence. \"There is absolutely no room in Australia for this kind of hate speech,\" she said. \"I don't care who you are.\" Lauren Rosewarne, a researcher in media, politics and popular culture at the University of Melbourne, said it was unclear if the band would recover from the comment. \"I'm not sure it's going to affect him one way or another,\" she said. \"Jack Black has been campaigning quite vigorously for Joe Biden and anti-Trump. \"If you were going to resent him for his politics, that would've happened before today.\"","summary":"Australian ambassador to the US slams Jack Black's band after an onstage quip about the weekend's assassination attempt, saying jokes about physical violence make him feel \"physically ill\".","url":"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-07-17/-devastated-fans-mourn-tenacious-d-cancelled-tour-kevin-rudd/104107402","image":"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/4e524f3c27a9d2478db8819ff0fa973d?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=1390&cropW=2471&xPos=0&yPos=174&width=862&height=485","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-17 00:12:36","author":"Esther Linder","authors":["Esther Linder"],"language":"en","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.255},{"id":251935774,"title":"The Critical Moments That Have Secret Service Boss Under Pressure","text":"Donald Trump was mere inches from being shot dead Saturday in what’s been widely characterized as the Secret Service’s biggest failure in decades. The near-murder of Trump was immediately damning for the Secret Service–whose entire purpose is to protect prospective, current, and past presidents (and their families)–but the blunder has become even more mind-boggling as more details have surfaced. That included the Secret Service conceding Tuesday that local cops were inside the very building where Thomas Crooks, 20, perched himself on a rooftop—less than 150 yards from Trump, a distance most proficient shooters consider an almost certain kill zone. Yet, those agents were unable to stop Cooks from climbing onto the roof, pulling out a rifle, and rattling off multiple shots toward the former president—one going through his ear, and another fatally striking a former fire chief who was attending the rally with his wife and daughter. Below, The Daily Beast has broken down the most egregious of the Secret Service’s failures known to date at Saturday’s rally in Pennsylvania. Pre-rally prep Things were bad from the jump for those tasked with protecting the former president. His rally was just outside Butler, a town of 13,000, and was in a mostly-open field with only a handful of buildings inside and outside the event’s official perimeter. Among those was the Agr International building, where Crooks infamously laid flat and opened fire at Trump. Despite advance teams arriving at the rally site as early as July 10 to prepare, the Agr building was designated to local law enforcement instead of the Secret Service—supposedly because it fell outside the event’s official perimeter and which was a usual practice, according to Secret Service spokesman Anthony Guglielmi. That decision baffled security and military experts. The retired sniper Dallas Alexander, whose Canadian Special Operations team is responsible for the furthest confirmed kill in history, said in a video statement Sunday that Crooks was in the “most fucking obvious” place for a gunman, adding that even a “seventh-grader” would’ve known to have the rooftop on lockdown. Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle, who’s been ordered to appear before Congress next week to attest for the security disaster, claimed Tuesday morning that the Secret Service didn’t have their own snipers on the building’s roof because it was “sloped,” which made it a safety issue. That excuse doesn’t add up, however, since Secret Service snipers were photographed on an equally sloped—if not more sloped—roof at the rally, behind Trump’s stage. Slipped through the cracks Donald Trump’s rally was slated to begin at 6 p.m. local time Saturday, and the former president officially started his speech about five minutes late. Crooks had his first encounter with security at 3 p.m. Saturday during a security screening, CNN revealed. A rangefinder Crooks was carrying alerted personnel, who, according to CNN, kept an eye on him until he left the area. Crooks’ next moves are uncertain, but it is believed he returned to his car to grab his rifle. He apparently used the building’s air conditioning system to climb on top of the building, a senior federal law enforcement official briefed on the investigation told CNN. Local law enforcement had their first encounter with Crooks 20 minutes before Trump’s speech and deemed he was suspicious, Beaver County Emergency Services revealed Tuesday. How, then, did Cooks continue to walk just outside the rally’s perimeter unchecked? That question remains unanswered, despite local officials admitting that officers at the scene deemed Crooks appeared so “suspicious,” that a local cop had taken a photo of him more than 15 minutes prior to the rally’s scheduled start. Failure to respond Chilling videos from the rally showed that some attendees spotted Crooks crawling onto the roof well before he was in a position to open fire, calling into question authorities’ response time to literal screams that there was a gunman on the roof. In one clip, obtained by The Washington Post, a man can be heard screaming “Officer! Officer!” as others point toward the Agr building and Crooks, a full 86 seconds before he fired his first shot. Others appeared to note that Crooks was on the roof more than two minutes before he opened fire at 6:11 p.m.—approximately six minutes into Trump’s rally spiel. “Look, they’re all pointing,” someone could be heard saying in a separate clip, as at least one police officer walked around the side of the building. “Someone’s on top of the roof.” “There he is, right there,” said another. “Right there, see him? He’s laying down!” Those clips have been backed up by multiple witnesses, who claimed they desperately tried to get police to stop Crooks to no avail. That included Greg Smith, who told BBC News he and others tried to alert police for “two or three minutes” that an armed man had reached the roof. The officers in the clip appeared to match the uniforms of the Butler Township Police Department, who was working in coordination with the Secret Service. Michael Slupe, the Butler County Sheriff, told local news outlets that moments before Crooks opened fire, one of his deputies reached the ledge of the Agr building’s roof and spotted Crooks, but had to let go of the ledge and retreat when the 20-year-old pointed his rifle at him. Just 12 seconds before the first shot was fired, an officer can be seen walking around the building Crooks was atop of. In other videos from those pivotal final seconds, people screamed that a man on the roof had a gun. MilkBarTV compiled some of these cellphone videos and stitched together a timed montage—a chilling four-and-a-half minute clip that shows the chaotic moments before a former U.S. president was nearly gunned down. The clip showed that seemingly everyone outside the rally’s perimeter knew a shooter was about to open fire. Yet, the scores of snipers and Secret Service agents inside the perimeter did nothing to stop him. “They were looking at him while he was looking at them,” one senior law enforcement official told CNN, describing how Crooks met eyes through the rangefinder with one of the four counter-sniper teams. While Crooks wasn’t stopped before pulling the trigger, the Secret Service said he was killed by a sniper—who fired a single shot—within seconds after opening fire. The aftermath Harsh criticisms of the Secret Service and its director, Kimberly Cheatle, arrived within hours. Joe Biden called for an independent investigation into what went wrong, which was echoed by Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas who called the incident a security “failure.” Security experts and lawmakers from both parties have agreed with Mayorkas’ assessment, saying they’re perplexed at how Crooks, a relative nobody, was able to come within an inch from murdering a former U.S. president. Cheatle has been ordered to testify in front of Congress on Monday to answer about her agency’s failings. As of Tuesday evening, the Secret Service is yet to concede outright that it was its own failures that led to Saturday’s disaster. Instead, the agency has insinuated the fault lies with local police who failed to secure the outside perimeter. Regardless of who’s to blame, the attack exposed long-standing issues within the Secret Service. Jason Chaffetz, who was chair of the House Oversight Committee in 2015 when it penned an investigative report on Secret Service security failures, has long called for the Secret Service to hire more agents. On Sunday, he called the Trump rally a “catastrophic failure.” “We did all these investigations and did an extensive report so this would never happen again,” he told the Post. “It’s as if they paid no attention to the bipartisan recommendations.”","summary":"Kamil Krzaczynski/AFP via Getty ImagesDonald Trump was mere inches from being shot dead Saturday in what’s been widely characterized as the Secret Service’s biggest failure in decades.\n\nThe near-murder of Trump was immediately damning for the Secret Service–whose entire purpose is to protect prospective, current, and past presidents (and their families)–but the blunder has become even more mind-boggling as more details have surfaced.\n\nThat included the Secret Service conceding Tuesday that local cops were inside the very building where Thomas Crooks, 20, perched himself on a rooftop—less than 150 yards from Trump, a distance most proficient shooters consider an almost certain kill zone.

It would mark a major shift for Biden, the former head of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who has long resisted calls to reform the high court, though since taking office he has been increasingly vocal about his belief that the court is abandoning mainstream constitutional interpretation. The details were first reported by The Washington Post. Any changes would require congressional approval, which would be unlikely in a divided Congress. But with Republican nominee Donald Trump bragging about putting the three justices on the high court who are now part of the conservative majority, Biden’s call for major changes could help animate his voters. Biden is also considering calling for a constitutional amendment that would eliminate the broad immunity for presidents granted by the court in its most recent term, after Donald Trump claimed he was immune from prosecution for his actions on Jan. 6, 2021, when a mob of his supporters violently descended on the U.S. Capitol. The people were not authorized to speak publicly about proposals that have not been finalized and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. The consideration of such proposals comes in response to growing outrage among Democrats about high court opinions that overturned landmark decisions on abortion rights and federal regulatory powers that had stood for decades. There have also been increasing questions surrounding the ethics of the court after revelations about some of the justices, including that Clarence Thomas had accepted luxury trips from a GOP megadonor. The Supreme Court did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the proposal. Biden, speaking in a weekend call with the Congressional Progressive Caucus, talked about the possibility, the people said. Biden often tells voters they need more Democrats in Congress and a Democrat in the White House to counter the impact of the conservative-leaning court, but these proposals would go much further. “And by the way, I’m going to need your help on the Supreme Court, because I’m about to come out. I don’t want to prematurely announce it, but I’m about to come out with a major initiative on limiting the court and what we do and — I’ve been working with constitutional scholars for the last three months, and I need some help,” he said, according to a transcript of the call. About 2 in 3 Americans say they favor term limits or a mandatory retirement age for Supreme Court justices, according to a 2022 poll from the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. According to June survey on the court, confidence remains low: 4 in 10 U.S. adults say they have hardly any confidence in the people running the Supreme Court. The survey found that 7 in 10 Americans think the high court’s justices are more influenced by ideology, while only about 3 in 10 U.S. adults think the justices are more likely to provide an independent check on other branches of government by being fair and impartial. In November, the court adopted its first code of ethics. The policy, agreed to by all nine justices, does not appear to impose any significant new requirements and leaves compliance entirely to each justice. Republicans have focused for years on remaking the federal judiciary and Supreme Court. When Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., was the majority leader, he refused to even meet in 2016 with Obama’s pick for the high court — current Attorney General Merrick Garland, a federal judge at that time. The nomination stalled until a Republican president, Trump, took over. Establishment GOP operatives backed Trump because of his pledge to name as many judges to the bench as possible. Their gamble worked. Trump ended up with three Supreme Court nominees and 54 federal appeals court judges, reshaping the courts for a generation. Democrats are now finally understanding the power of judges as a voting tool, and Biden has made judicial nominations a priority, appointing a record number of judges for a president at this point in his first term, including some of the most diverse picks yet to the judiciary. Biden often speaks about those accomplishments during his reelection campaign, but Democrats have pushed him to go further. Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The DNC first released a summary of its new agenda on July 13. The platform touts President Joe Biden’s policy positions and presents a “bold, progressive agenda” for a potential second Biden administration. “We have a product to be proud of, we have a president to be proud of, we have an administration to be proud of, and let’s get out there and finish the work,” Pennsylvania state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta (D) said after the vote. The platform positions include growing the economy, lowering family costs, tackling climate change, securing energy independence, closing the “racial wealth gap,” investing in small businesses, restoring Roe v. Wade, gun control, securing the border, and “strengthening American leadership worldwide.” DNC Chair Jaime Harrison celebrated the platform—which “incorporated a diverse set of expertise and perspectives”—in a statement. “The breadth and depth of this platform is rooted in our collective experience and reflects a bold agenda that affirms Democrats’ commitment to protecting fundamental freedoms,” he said.

The plan also involves “expanding access to capital” for Americans to start and grow small businesses. Democrats also hope to make the tax code “fairer for the middle class while making the wealthy and big corporations finally pay their fair share.” Americans earning less than $400,000 a year will see no tax increases, “period,” they added, suggesting that the plan would cut the federal deficit by $3 trillion in the next 10 years. “Lower costs is Democrats’ No. 1 economic priority,” the committee wrote, while noting President Biden’s efforts to cap insulin at $35 a month for seniors on Medicare. The summary also mentions the president’s efforts to forgive student loans for millions of borrowers.Climate and EnergyDemocrats hope to continue President Biden’s climate agenda, which they describe as the “most aggressive … in history.” “Democrats will scale up solar, wind, and geothermal projects made possible by the Inflation Reduction Act and invest in clean energy R&D to build America’s legacy as a nation of new frontiers and possibilities,” the committee wrote. The plan involves expanding the clean-energy workforce, with a goal of tripling the size of the American Climate Corps within 10 years, which President Biden launched in 2023 to “mobilize a new, diverse generation of clean energy, conservation, and resilience workers.” Democrats also hope to scale back “tens of billions of dollars” in oil and gas subsidies. President Biden “is positioning America to lead the future—energy independent, resilient, innovative, and strong.”Border SecurityThe 2024 party platform calls for President Biden to “secure our border, fix our immigration system, and provide a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers and others” as a continuation of work the DNC says he has done since “his first day in office.” The plan emphasizes the president’s efforts to find across-the-aisle solutions to the border crisis, including the bipartisan border bill that twice failed in Congress earlier this year. Democrats also touted the president’s recent executive order on limiting border crossings, which they stated cut illegal crossings “by over 50 percent.” “In President Biden’s second term, he will push Congress to pass legislation that is consistent with our values as a nation,” the committee wrote. Democrats say that legislation must secure the border, reform the asylum system, expand legal immigration, and “keep families together by supporting long-term undocumented individuals, including Dreamers.” They suggest “lasting, comprehensive reforms” for border security “require congressional action.”Other Platform Initiatives The 2024 Democratic Party platform also involves gun control, including “universal background checks, safe storage requirements, and a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.” Democrats also want to “strengthen democracy” and advance a “unity agenda” to tackle challenges common to all Americans, including fighting the opioid epidemic, addressing the mental health crisis, “holding Big Tech accountable,” helping veterans and combatting the cancer crisis. The party also hopes to restore abortion access at the federal level after the 2022 Dobbs decision reversed Roe v. Wade, sending the issue back to the states. The platform will be displayed during the Democratic National Convention next month, which starts on Aug. 19. Democrats approve a new party platform every four years, with the previous 92-page platform being approved on July 27, 2020.RNC PlatformRepublicans approved their new party platform on July 15, the first day of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.

Addressing the NAACP convention in Las Vegas, Biden said curbing political violence in the country should mean combating all kinds of bloodshed — including reducing police brutality and banning weapons like the AR-style rifle used in the weekend attack on the former president. “Our politics have become too heated,” Biden said. That didn’t stop him from tearing into Trump, though, listing why the former president’s administration was “hell” for Black Americans, including his mishandling of the coronavirus pandemic, skyrocketing unemployment amid early lockdowns and attempts to, as Biden put it, erase Black history. “Just because we must lower the temperature in our politics as it relates to violence doesn’t mean we should stop telling the truth,” Biden told the crowd that often broke into chants of “Four more years!” The president is aiming to showcase his administration’s support for Black voters who are a tentpole of the Democratic coalition and of his personal political support. As part of his swing in Nevada, he’ll also participate in an interview with BET and address the Hispanic advocacy group UnidosUS, another crucial Democratic-leaning bloc. For the NAACP crowd, Biden seized on Trump recently referencing “Black jobs,” drawing big applause by joking, “I love the phrase.” “I know what a Black job is. It’s the vice president of the United States,” Biden said of Vice President Kamala Harris, who he added “could be president.” He also referenced Barack Obama as the nation’s first Black president, and his own appointment to the Supreme Court of its first Black and female justice, Ketanji Brown Jackson. Biden’s trip comes as Democrats have been engaged in a weeks-long crisis of confidence over his candidacy after his devastating debate with Trump last month. The president’s shaky performance inflamed voter concerns about his age, fitness for office and capacity to defeat Trump once again. Republicans, for their part, are demonstrating that they are more coalesced than ever around Trump amid their national convention in Milwaukee. The 81-year-old Biden has rejected a flurry of calls from within his party to step aside, restating his belief that he is the best-positioned Democrat to beat Trump. He has relied heavily on his support among Black and Latino elected officials, and was set to appear with many of them in Nevada. The president made indirect reference to unrest in his own party on Tuesday, recalling President Harry S. Truman famously saying, “If you want a friend in Washington, get a dog.” “After the last couple of weeks, I know what he means,” Biden said. He said later, “hopefully, with age, comes a little bit of wisdom.” Biden also promised to use the first 100 days of a second term to oversee congressional approval of a dramatic expansion of voting rights — something he’s been unable to so far. He also renewed earlier promises to “end medical debt,” saying he was working with states to settle outstanding bills for care for “pennies on the dollar.” “I know the good Lord hasn’t brought us this far to leave us now,” Biden told the convention, offering overtly religious tones. Trump has tried to appeal to both Black and Latino voters, hoping to capitalize on Biden’s sagging favorability. While it’s not clear that the loss of enthusiasm for Biden has helped Trump’s approval with those groups, any marginal loss of support for Biden could prove pivotal in a close race. The president and his campaign hit pause on their criticisms of Trump in the immediate aftermath of the shooting Saturday at Trump’s rally in Pennsylvania, where the Republican candidate was injured in the ear, a rallygoer was killed and two others seriously injured. In an Oval Office address on Sunday night, Biden called on Americans to reject political violence and for political leaders to “cool it down.” In a Monday interview with NBC News he allowed that he made a “ mistake ” when he told campaign donors that he wanted to put a “bull’s-eye” on Trump, but argued that the rhetoric from his opponent was more incendiary. “Look, how do you talk about the threat to democracy, which is real, when a president says things like he says?” Biden said. “Do you just not say anything because it may incite somebody?” NAACP President Derrick Johnson, in an interview with the AP, sidestepped questions about whether Biden should step aside as the Democratic nominee and whether the president, who often credits his place in the Oval Office to Black voters, could still inspire people to turn out for his candidacy. Johnson instead focused on the need for Black voters to hear “solutions” on issues like inflation, education and attacks on civil rights, which are among the top concerns for Black communities in this election. “We want to focus on the policy goals of whoever occupies the White House in the next term,” Johnson said. He added that Black voters would dismiss candidates “concerned with personality and sound bites.” Later, speaking at an economic summit hosted by Congressional Black Caucus Chair and Rep. Steven Horsford at the College of Southern Nevada’s campus in North Las Vegas, Biden announced that the regional housing authority and municipal officials would receive a $50 million federal grant to build 400 affordable housing units — playing up his attempts to lower rents in a state where housing costs are a critical political issue. The president also talked about his administration’s efforts to ease the effects of extreme heat on the workforce, while continuing to lay into his opponent in November’s election. “Trump says he doesn’t believe climate change is real. Maybe he should step out here in Vegas, where it’s 120 degrees, in his bare feet,” Biden said as the crowd hooted. Biden is also proposing to cap rent increases at 5% for tenants whose landlords own over 50 units. If landlords hiked rents by more than that, they would lose access to some tax write-offs. But doing that would require congressional approval that Biden is unlikely to receive with a House Republican majority. Trump has also used Nevada to float new economic policies. He said he would end taxes on the tips received by workers in the service-industry focused state, a concept that has since been endorsed by Nevada’s Democratic senators, Jacky Rosen and Catherine Cortez Masto.

The proposals under serious consideration include legislation to establish term limits for justices and establishing an updated code of ethics that would be binding and enforceable, a source said. The policies, which haven’t been finalized, may be rolled out in the coming weeks, which would be a new approach for a president who has long been skeptical of restructuring the Supreme Court. A White House spokesperson declined to comment. Biden told lawmakers in the Congressional Progressive Caucus during a virtual meeting Saturday that he had been consulting constitutional scholars on the matter for more than a month, according to a person familiar with the discussion. “I’m going to need your help to and advice on how we should be doing what I’m going to be doing there. Want to make sure we have a closer working relationship, because we’re in this together,” Biden told the lawmakers, though he didn’t get into specific policy substance, the source said. The Washington Post first reported Biden’s plans. Two other sources told NBC News that Biden told the lawmakers he will come out for big reforms, without giving them details, but that members on the call understood him to be referring to term limits and ethics rules. The call took place Saturday before the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump at a Pennsylvania rally. “Look, it’s not, it’s not hyperbole to suggest Trump is literally an existential threat, an existential threat to the very constitution of democracy we, we say we care about. And I mean if this guy wins, he’s not, and now, especially with that Supreme Court giving him the kind of breadth of — I don’t need to get into the Supreme Court right now — anyway, but I need your help,” Biden said. Changing the structure of the Supreme Court would require Congress to make a new law. That’s extremely unlikely while Republicans control the House, as the party is pleased with the 6-3 conservative majority it has built on the high court. But the proposals could become a useful messaging device for Biden on the campaign trail. And if Democrats sweep the election, they may have a fighting chance of passing. Democrats have rallied voters against the Supreme Court, citing unpopular rulings like the elimination of federal abortion rights and a spate of recent reports detailing apparent ethical lapses among some of the justices. Last month, Senate Democrats sought to pass Supreme Court ethics legislation but ran into Republican opposition. In the House, Reps. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., and Don Beyer, D-Va., have lintroduced legislation that would impose 18-year term limits for future justices, ultimately creating vacancies to fill during every four-year presidential term and preventing retirements for partisan reasons. Khanna praised Biden for warming up to the idea, noting that he first introduced term limits legislation in 2020. “Since then, we have been advocating for the president to champion this reform,” Khanna told NBC News on Tuesday. “It is a big step for him to now call for commonsense term limits for the court and a judicial code of ethics.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nWASHINGTON — President Joe Biden is preparing to endorse significant proposals to&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Biden informs lawmakers he is considering significant Supreme Court changes first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/biden-informs-lawmakers-he-is-considering-significant-supreme-court-changes/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/rewrite-this-title-Biden-tells-lawmakers-he-is-weighing-big.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-17 00:02:47","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.091},{"id":251935644,"title":"Here’s What Trump Said About Biden When He Called in To Check on Him Post Assassination Attempt","text":"President Joe Biden checked in with his political rival, Donald Trump, hours after the former president was the target of an assassination attempt at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. In an interview with ABC News's Jonathan Karl, Trump appreciated Biden and deemed their chat \"very nice.\" \"He couldn’t have been nicer,\" the Republican leader remarked. In an interview with Lester Holt of NBC on July 15, Biden was also questioned over his phone call—which he characterized as \"very cordial\"—with Trump following the shooting. \"I told him how concerned I was and wanted to make sure I knew how he was actually doing. He sounded good. He said he was fine. And he thanked me for calling him. I told him he was literally in the prayers of Jill and me, and I hoped his whole family was weathering this,\" Biden disclosed. Subsequently, Karl asked Trump if the near-miss gunshot wound to his right ear \"changed him.\" The former president, responded, \"I don’t like to think about that, but, yes, it has an impact.\" Trump expressed his amazement at the number of people, who had contacted him following the assassination attempt, including well-known figures who had previously criticized him. Although he assured that his right ear was healing well, Trump hoped that the bandage would come off before he had to speak at the RNC. Meanwhile, his opponents have called for unity and peace in the aftermath of the terrible shooting. Biden addressed the country on July 14 with a message emphasizing the need to be calm and collected, as per Variety. “We cannot...we must not go down this road in America. The political rhetoric in this country has gotten very heated,” Biden said in the Oval Office address, adding, “It’s time to cool it down.” Additionally, he conveyed his concerns for Trump and extended condolences to the family of Corey Comperatore, the 50-year fireman who passed away after trying to protect his family from stray bullets. The horrific political violence is just one more startling incident in an unprecedented presidential contest between Biden and Trump. “Politics must never be a literal battlefield — or god forbid, a killing field,” Biden added. He also referenced other instances of political violence, such as the Jan 6 Capitol riots and the attack on former Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband. Biden and his allies have also pulled down campaign commercials that targeted Trump and urged Americans to be calm, as reported by ABC 7. On Truth Social on July 15, Trump also appealed for unity, but went on to ditch the messaging as he started to write about the legal difficulties against him, using terms like 'witch hunt', 'January 6th hoax', and 'the Manhattan D.A.'s Zombie Case'.","summary":"In an interview with Lester Holt of NBC on July 15, Biden was also questioned over his phone call, which he characterized as &#34;very cordial.&#34;","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/heres-what-trump-said-about-biden-when-he-called-in-to-check-on-him-post-assassination-attempt","image":"https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/705350/uploads/0cc526b0-434b-11ef-b97e-af2436dbcabf_1200_630.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-17 00:01:01","author":"INQUISITR,Suchitra B","authors":["INQUISITR","Suchitra B"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.34},{"id":251936132,"title":"Adam Schiff Warns in Private Meeting Democrats Will Lose Everything if Biden Stays","text":"Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) warned in a recent private meeting that Democrats stand to lose everything this election so long as President Joe Biden remains at the top of the ticket. Schiff delivered his warning to donors during a meeting on Saturday, which occurred prior to the attempted assassination on former President Donald Trump’s life. Schiff feared not only that Democrats would lose the White House but that they would also lose the down-ticket races in the House and Senate. “I think if he is our nominee, I think we lose,” Schiff said at the meeting, according to a transcript obtained by the New York Times. “And we may very, very well lose the Senate and lose our chance to take back the House.” Since Schiff made these remarks before the attempted assassination on Trump, it remains unclear if he still holds to those views. As Breitbart News reported, the Democrats quieted all movements within the party to replace Joe Biden as the nominee following the failed assassination attempt, the focus now shifting toward unity in the wake of a historic moment unseen in over 40 years. “We’ve all resigned ourselves to a second Trump presidency,” one senior Democrat lawmaker was quoted as saying to Axios. Since that fateful day, President Biden has given no hint or indication that he plans to step down, with calls for him to do so only coming from social media. According to the New York Times, during the fundraiser attended by Schiff and other Democrats, the congressman said that Biden and his staff had “been generally unwilling to engage the views of outside pollsters and political experts and urged them to do so.” “At least one donor who attended the event and listened to Mr. Schiff’s remarks said he left dejected, believing that Mr. Biden’s chances of winning were now slim and that they should concentrate [on] giving their time and money to downballot candidates in the hopes of salvaging something for the party,” it added.

Biden was greeted by chants of \"four more years\" as he spoke to the NAACP's annual convention in Las Vegas, a major gathering of Black voters. Biden said he was grateful that Trump was not seriously hurt at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday but roundly criticized him on a variety of fronts including his handling of the economy during the coronavirus pandemic. \"Let me say it again because Trump is lying like hell about it - Black unemployment hit a record low under the Biden-Harris administration,\" Biden said. He scolded Trump for initially contending that former President Barack Obama was not an American citizen and for his reference to \"Black jobs\" at the Trump-Biden debate on June 27. \"I am all in,\" said Biden. The attempt on Trump's life on Saturday prompted the Biden campaign to pull its television ads, call off verbal attacks on the former president and focus instead on a message of unity. \"Our politics got too heated,\" said Biden. The campaign's strategy previously was to focus on tough criticism of Trump as a threat to U.S. democracy and to highlight his failure to admit his 2020 election loss and his felony convictions. Now, it is trying to calibrate a less pugilistic message that still strikes a stark comparison between the two candidates. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the oldest and largest U.S. civil rights organization, represents a key constituency for the Democratic Party. While Black voters turned out heavily for Biden in 2020, polls have shown waning support for him from the constituency in this election. \"People are concerned about the price of gas, price of bread, but they're also concerned with their growing knowledge around Project 2025,\" Derrick Johnson, the NAACP president, told Reuters on Monday, referring to a set of conservative policy proposals that have become a lighting rod for Trump critics. On Sunday, Biden used the formal setting of the White House Oval Office to ask Americans to lower the political temperature, recommit themselves to resolving their differences peacefully. He said the Nov. 5 presidential election will be a \"time of testing.\" In an interview with NBC News, Biden said on Monday it was a mistake for him to use the term \"bullseye\" in reference to Trump during a recent donor campaign call. The president postponed a trip to Texas on Monday, where he was expected to speak on the 60th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act at the Lyndon B. Johnson presidential library. White House officials hope the Trump assassination attempt will ease pressure on Biden to step aside as his Democratic Party's candidate in response to concerns about his mental acuity and stamina to govern for another four-year term. At the end of his remarks in Las Vegas, Biden addressed the criticism that he is too old for the job. \"Hopefully today I've demonstrated a little bit of wisdom. Here's what I do know. I know how to tell the truth. I know right from wrong. I know how to do this job. And I know the good Lord hasn't brought us this far to leave us now. We have more work to do,\" he said. On Wednesday, Biden is scheduled to speak to Latino leaders at the UnidosUS Annual Conference also in Las Vegas. Meanwhile, Trump and Republicans are gathered in Milwaukee for the party's nominating convention that kicked off Monday with the selection of U.S. Senator J.D. Vance as Trump's running mate.

I didn’t volunteer because I agreed with his politics. I volunteered because if our leaders aren’t safe, our Constitution and our democracy aren’t either. This past weekend, Americans witnessed an extraordinary display of these values — plus incredible courage — when several Secret Service agents put their bodies directly into the path of more potential bullets that could’ve struck former President Trump. The agents’ selfless act wasn’t motivated by the red and blue of our national politics. It was motivated by the red, white, and blue of our stars and stripes. I developed an even greater personal appreciation for that principle during my first Congressional campaign in 2022, when law enforcement detained a man who said he planned to assassinate me. After speaking to the detective, I wondered if I made the right decision to trade a career where I’d helped federal agents respond to death threats for a job where I now received them. I viscerally understood how fear can stifle speech, debate, and, perhaps worst of all, the willingness to serve. That is why the attack on former President Trump was an attack on all of us. So was the horrific attack on Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s husband, along with Congressman Steve Scalise, Congresswoman Gabby Giffords, President Ronald Reagan, the Kennedys, Dr. King, and far too many others throughout our history. Congress needs to take immediate steps to increase security for our leaders, enact common sense gun safety reforms, and fix a broken online ecosystem that maximizes profits by amplifying divisive, violent, and conspiratorial content. Fortunately, in the days after the attack, Republicans and Democrats in Congress are already discussing enhancements to Secret Service protection for presidential candidates. Congress should come together and pass these bills and fully fund federal law enforcement agencies like the FBI and Secret Service as they complete their investigations and increase protective measures. We need similar enhancements to security for members of Congress, federal judges, and even political candidates running for higher-level offices. Americans also deserve a federal red flag law to enable law enforcement, including the Secret Service, to obtain a court order to take assault rifles away from those who threaten political violence before it happens. The attempt on President Trump’s life was carried out with an AR-15; yet another shooting that underscores why we need this commonsense reform. business owners and news outlets sued out of existence. These reforms would also encourage more public servants — and fewer content creators — to run for the House of Representatives. Congressman Calvert and I disagree about a lot. We may have our divisions, and this campaign will be spirited. But loving your neighbor — and your fellow Americans — should never depend on whether they plan to vote for Joe Biden or Donald Trump, Will Rollins or Ken Calvert, or the red team versus blue.

It would mark a major shift for Biden, the former head of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who has long resisted calls to reform the high court, though since taking office he has been increasingly vocal about his belief that the court is abandoning mainstream constitutional interpretation. The details were first reported by The Washington Post. Any changes would require congressional approval, which would be unlikely in a divided Congress. But with Republican nominee Donald Trump bragging about putting the three justices on the high court who are now part of the conservative majority, Biden’s call for major changes could help animate his voters. Biden is also considering calling for a constitutional amendment that would eliminate the broad immunity for presidents granted by the court in its most recent term, after Donald Trump claimed he was immune from prosecution for his actions on Jan. 6, 2021, when a mob of his supporters violently descended on the U.S. Capitol. The people were not authorized to speak publicly about proposals that have not been finalized and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. The consideration of such proposals comes in response to growing outrage among Democrats about high court opinions that overturned landmark decisions on abortion rights and federal regulatory powers that had stood for decades. There have also been increasing questions surrounding the ethics of the court after revelations about some of the justices, including that Clarence Thomas had accepted luxury trips from a GOP megadonor. The Supreme Court did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the proposal. Biden, speaking in a weekend call with the Congressional Progressive Caucus, talked about the possibility, the people said. Biden often tells voters they need more Democrats in Congress and a Democrat in the White House to counter the impact of the conservative-leaning court, but these proposals would go much further. “And by the way, I’m going to need your help on the Supreme Court, because I’m about to come out. I don’t want to prematurely announce it, but I’m about to come out with a major initiative on limiting the court and what we do and — I’ve been working with constitutional scholars for the last three months, and I need some help,” he said, according to a transcript of the call. About 2 in 3 Americans say they favor term limits or a mandatory retirement age for Supreme Court justices, according to a 2022 poll from the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. According to June survey on the court, confidence remains low: 4 in 10 U.S. adults say they have hardly any confidence in the people running the Supreme Court. The survey found that 7 in 10 Americans think the high court’s justices are more influenced by ideology, while only about 3 in 10 U.S. adults think the justices are more likely to provide an independent check on other branches of government by being fair and impartial. In November, the court adopted its first code of ethics. The policy, agreed to by all nine justices, does not appear to impose any significant new requirements and leaves compliance entirely to each justice. Republicans have focused for years on remaking the federal judiciary and Supreme Court. When Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., was the majority leader, he refused to even meet in 2016 with Obama’s pick for the high court — current Attorney General Merrick Garland, a federal judge at that time. The nomination stalled until a Republican president, Trump, took over. Establishment GOP operatives backed Trump because of his pledge to name as many judges to the bench as possible. Their gamble worked. Trump ended up with three Supreme Court nominees and 54 federal appeals court judges, reshaping the courts for a generation. Democrats are now finally understanding the power of judges as a voting tool, and Biden has made judicial nominations a priority, appointing a record number of judges for a president at this point in his first term, including some of the most diverse picks yet to the judiciary. Biden often speaks about those accomplishments during his reelection campaign, but Democrats have pushed him to go further.","summary":"President Joe Biden is seriously considering proposals to establish term limits for U.S. Supreme Court justices, and an ethics code that would be enforceable under law, amid growing concerns that the justices are not held accountable\n\n\nThe post Biden seriously considering proposals on Supreme Court term limits, ethics code, AP sources say appeared first on Boston.com.","url":"https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2024/07/16/biden-seriously-considering-proposals-on-supreme-court-term-limits-ethics-code-ap-sources-say/","image":"https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Supreme_Court_Trump_Immunity_77623-669705b1a2685-768x432.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-16 23:47:43","author":"Associated Press,The Washington Post","authors":["Associated Press","The Washington Post"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.179},{"id":251935862,"title":"In NAACP speech, Biden denounces violence but resumes attacks on Trump","text":"United States President Joe Biden has returned to the campaign trail for the first time since his Republican rival, former President Donald Trump, narrowly avoided an assassination attempt over the weekend. Speaking on Tuesday in Las Vegas, Nevada, Biden addressed the shooting directly, which killed a bystander and injured at least two others, as well as Trump himself. “Our politics have gotten too heated,” Biden said as he took the podium. “As I’ve made clear throughout my presidency, we all have a responsibility to lower the temperature and condemn violence in any form. We’ve gotta remember, in America, we’re not enemies. We’re friends. We’re neighbours. We’re fellow Americans.” But while he denounced political violence and polarisation, Biden nevertheless criticised Trump both implicitly and explicitly, calling out the Republican for his track record on the economy, reproductive rights, gun violence and other issues. “Just because our politics are very divided doesn’t mean we should stop telling the truth. Who you are, what you’ve done, what you will do — that’s fair game,” Biden said. Highlighting political violence Biden delivered his remarks on the fourth day of the national convention for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), a prominent civil rights organisation in the US. The appearance came only three days after a 20-year-old gunman positioned himself on a roof in Butler, Pennsylvania, and fired an AR-15-style rifle at Trump as he spoke at a rally. The shooting heightened tensions ahead of a tightly fought US presidential race, set to culminate with election day on November 5. Biden, a Democrat, seeks to retain the presidency in a rematch of his 2020 race against Trump. But in the aftermath of the shooting, Biden temporarily suspended television advertisements attacking the Republican leader, as both candidates made calls for unity. The Democratic incumbent reprised that theme in his speech to the NAACP convention, albeit with some biting remarks for his Republican rival. “We have to say with one voice that violence is not the answer. That’s what we should rally around as a nation. That’s the unity I’m talking about,” Biden said. After repeating his offer of prayers to the Trump family, Biden quickly pivoted to the question of violence against the Black community — an issue he implied Trump was weak in. Biden drew a stark contrast between the outpouring of support after the Trump shooting and the vitriol that faced Black election workers after the 2020 election and Black police officers present at the attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. He also blasted Trump for his response to the murder of George Floyd, a Black man in Minnesota who died after a law enforcement official kneeled on his neck for more than nine minutes. “You understand, if you’re going to talk about standing against violence, you must stand against all violence. You must stand against violence perpetrated against presidential candidates in Pennsylvania,” Biden said. “The violence perpetrated against George Floyd in Minnesota. Against Black veterans and police officers like Eugene Goodman on January 6. And Black election workers, like Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss in Atlanta. We have to stand against the violence and intimidation of white supremacy.” Biden particularly underscored Trump’s response to the Floyd murder. Speaking to the crowd at the NAACP gathering, he said: “When you peacefully protested George Floyd’s murder, Donald Trump called for the National Guard to go after you. What in the hell is the matter with this man?” A critical voting bloc Black voters represent a key constituency for the Democratic president. In 2020, Black residents in South Carolina were credited with reviving Biden’s campaign in the Democratic primaries, ultimately giving him the boost he needed to claim the party nomination. And in the general election that year, Black voters turned out overwhelmingly for Biden, with 92 percent casting their ballot for him. But in this year’s race, Trump has tried to chip away at that base of support, and critics have called on Democrats to do more to ensure the concerns of Black communities are prioritised in the party platform. In Tuesday’s speech, Biden played up the $16bn in funding his administration earmarked for historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs). He also touted a dip in Black unemployment, warning that Trump’s economic policies could reverse those gains. The Democrat also reprised a much-mocked statement Trump made during the June 27 presidential debate, when the Republican referred to immigrants taking “Black jobs”. Critics, including at the NAACP, denounced that phrase as racist. “Folks, I know what a Black job is. It’s the vice president of the United States. I know what a Black job is. It’s the first Black president in American history, Barack Obama,” Biden told the NAACP convention, taking the moment to highlight the diversity of his administration. He also hinted at a greater role in the future for his vice president, Kamala Harris. “She’s not only a great vice president. She could be president of the United States.” Efforts to recover post-debate Biden, 81, has faced repeated calls to withdraw from the 2024 presidential race, after a wobbly, stuttering performance at the June 27 debate. Harris has been floated as one of several possible replacements for him on the campaign trail. But Biden has maintained he will remain in the race, and he used the NAACP convention’s slogan this year — “all in” — to emphasise the point: “Are you all in? Because I’m all in.” Still, he acknowledged the pushback he has received on Capitol Hill, hinting that the criticism from within his own party has left him isolated. “[President Harry] Truman said, ‘You want a friend in Washington? Get a dog.’ Well, guess what? After the last couple of weeks, I know what he means,” Biden said to the audience, which responded with chuckles. “So many of you had my back, and I think I’ve had yours as well, and I will never forget it.” Speaking from Las Vegas, Al Jazeera correspondent Rob Reynolds observed that Biden received a “very very warm and friendly reception” from the audience members in the convention centre, noting that they broke out in chants of, “Four more years! Four more years!” “It is clear that this is the constituency that Joe Biden needs,” Reynolds said of the speech. “This is an appeal to that crucial demographic, that crucial voting bloc, which has been by and large behind Biden for this period of crisis in his campaign. Very few if any Black public or elected officials have called upon Biden to step down, even when others were calling upon him to step down and abandon his candidacy after his somewhat disastrous June 27 debate performance against Donald Trump.” In the lead-up to the president’s remarks on Tuesday, NAACP president Derrick Johnson likewise underscored the Black community’s importance in the upcoming election. But he underscored that his group — considered the oldest civil rights organisation in the US — is fundamentally nonpartisan. “This election is not about candidate A versus candidate B, or political party A or political party B. We are nonpartisan, but we are political as hell, and we know this is a fight we must take on,” Johnson said in his speech. “Let’s stay focused not on the people but the policy priorities they represent and vote for those who align themselves with what’s in the best interest of our communities. And I can assure you, if you do that, it’s in the best interest of America.”","summary":"The Democratic president also made an impassioned appeal to Black voters, who have been a cornerstone of his campaign.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/16/in-naacp-speech-biden-denounces-violence-but-resumes-attacks-on-trump?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2024-07-16T221047Z_1389898788_RC2MW8AZETK1_RTRMADP_3_USA-ELECTION-BIDEN-1721168506.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-16 23:47:04","author":"Apps Support","authors":["Apps Support"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"qa","sentiment":-0.119},{"id":251935984,"title":"Biden pledges he is ‘all in,’ criticizes Trump on policy","text":"LAS VEGAS >> President Joe Biden promised Black voters on Tuesday that he was “all in” to seek reelection on Nov. 5 and assailed Donald Trump’s record as president, in his first political speech since his Republican rival’s attempted assassination. Biden was greeted by chants of “four more years” as he spoke to the NAACP’s annual convention in Las Vegas, a major gathering of Black voters. Biden said he was grateful that Trump was not seriously hurt at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday but roundly criticized him on a variety of fronts including his handling of the economy during the coronavirus pandemic. “Let me say it again because Trump is lying like hell about it – Black unemployment hit a record low under the Biden-Harris administration,” Biden said. He scolded Trump for initially contending that former President Barack Obama was not an American citizen and for his reference to “Black jobs” at the Trump-Biden debate on June 27. “I am all in,” said Biden. The attempt on Trump’s life on Saturday prompted the Biden campaign to pull its television ads, call off verbal attacks on the former president and focus instead on a message of unity. “Our politics got too heated,” said Biden. The campaign’s strategy previously was to focus on tough criticism of Trump as a threat to U.S. democracy and to highlight his failure to admit his 2020 election loss and his felony convictions. Now, it is trying to calibrate a less pugilistic message that still strikes a stark comparison between the two candidates. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the oldest and largest U.S. civil rights organization, represents a key constituency for the Democratic Party. While Black voters turned out heavily for Biden in 2020, polls have shown waning support for him from the constituency in this election. “People are concerned about the price of gas, price of bread, but they’re also concerned with their growing knowledge around Project 2025,” Derrick Johnson, the NAACP president, told Reuters on Monday, referring to a set of conservative policy proposals that have become a lighting rod for Trump critics. On Sunday, Biden used the formal setting of the White House Oval Office to ask Americans to lower the political temperature, and recommit themselves to resolving their differences peacefully. He said the Nov. 5 presidential election will be a “time of testing.” In an interview with NBC News, Biden said on Monday it was a mistake for him to use the term “bullseye” in reference to Trump during a recent donor campaign call. The president postponed a trip to Texas on Monday, where he was expected to speak on the 60th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act at the Lyndon B. Johnson presidential library. White House officials hope the Trump assassination attempt will ease pressure on Biden to step aside as his Democratic Party’s candidate in response to concerns about his mental acuity and stamina to govern for another four-year term. At the end of his remarks in Las Vegas, Biden addressed the criticism that he is too old for the job. “Hopefully today I’ve demonstrated a little bit of wisdom. Here’s what I do know. I know how to tell the truth. I know right from wrong. I know how to do this job. And I know the good Lord hasn’t brought us this far to leave us now. We have more work to do,” he said. On Wednesday, Biden is scheduled to speak to Latino leaders at the UnidosUS Annual Conference also in Las Vegas. Meanwhile, Trump and Republicans are gathered in Milwaukee for the party’s nominating convention that kicked off Monday with the selection of U.S. Senator J.D. Vance as Trump’s running mate.","summary":"LAS VEGAS >> President Joe Biden promised Black voters on Tuesday that he was &#8220;all in&#8221; to seek reelection on Nov. 5 and assailed Donald Trump&#8217;s record as president, in his first political speech since his Republican rival&#8217;s attempted assassination.","url":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2024/07/16/breaking-news/biden-pledges-he-is-all-in-criticizes-trump-on-policy/","image":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/web1_2024-07-16T233852Z_876246046_RC2NW8AVQYNZ_RTRMADP_3_USA-ELECTION-BIDEN.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-16 23:46:00","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.354},{"id":251934852,"title":"What would Biden’s proposed 5% nationwide rent cap mean for the Bay Area?","text":"President Joe Biden on Tuesday announced a new proposal to cap rent increases for many apartment buildings nationwide, a plan cheered by Bay Area tenant advocates but that landlords and experts said could exacerbate the region’s chronic housing shortage. Biden unveiled the proposal, which would require approval by Congress, following an earlier pledge during his State of the Union address in March to rein in soaring housing costs across the country. “Rent is too high and buying a home is out of reach for too many working families and young Americans, after decades of failure to build enough homes,” the president, fresh off a disastrous debate performance and looking to shore up support among Democratic voters, said in a statement. “I’m determined to turn that around.” Under the plan, landlords would either need to cap rent hikes at 5% a year or lose out on federal tax breaks. The rule, which would last through the end of 2026, would only apply to landlords who own more than 50 apartments. That works out to an estimated 20 million units, almost half the country’s rental market, officials said. It was unclear how many Bay Area apartments, many of which are already subject to state and local rent control laws, would be covered by the federal cap. The proposal, coming as Biden trails former President Donald Trump in the polls, is unlikely to get serious consideration during an election year. And even as high housing costs have become a growing concern for voters nationwide, Democrats would likely need to win control of the White House and both chambers of Congress this November for the plan to have a chance at becoming law. Still, local advocates, who’ve long railed against corporate landlords for what they describe as unfair rent hikes, lauded Biden’s plan. “In the Bay Area, where the housing crisis is acutely felt, these measures are crucial,” Kate O’Hara, executive director of the East Bay Alliance for a Sustainable Economy, said in a statement. “We need robust rent control policies to protect our communities from the predatory practices of corporate landlords.” “I think it would help renters nationally,” agreed Donel Fontil, a renter in Contra Costa County “I absolutely support the proposal.” According to researchers with the Bay Area Equity Atlas, nearly half of renters in the region spend more than 30% of their income on rent, classifying them as “rent-burdened” by federal standards. The median cost of an apartment available for rent in the region tops $2,500 a month, according to data from Apartment List. Even so, Bay Area rents haven’t spiked nearly as quickly as in the rest of the country as inflation has taken hold, in part due to the region’s roughly 3% population decline since the start of the pandemic. In June, local rents rose 0.6% from the same time last year, compared to 5.1% nationwide, according to federal data. How big an effect Biden’s rent cap would have on Bay Area renters would largely depend on whether their city already has a local rent control law on the books. The region’s three major cities, San Jose, Oakland and San Francisco, all have rent restrictions, as do a handful of smaller cities, including Richmond, Mountain View and East Palo Alto. While most of those rent caps are at least as strict as the proposed 5% federal limit, California law mandates that local rent control can only cover older apartment buildings. Biden’s plan, however, would appear to cover many newer units. It would only provide an exemption for new construction. A state law enacted in 2020 also caps rent increases for older apartments in California at 5% plus inflation or 10%, whichever is lower. The California Apartment Association, which opposes Biden’s plan, said adding additional renter protections would only further discourage developers from building more housing. Experts agree the state needs many more homes for people across a range of income levels if it hopes to bring down housing costs. “Rather than implementing a policy that has been shown to make housing shortages worse, leaders in Washington, D.C., should focus their efforts on ideas that will help fight our housing crisis,” said Tom Bannon, CEO of the association, in a statement, pointing to increasing federal rental subsidies and tax incentives for home builders. Opponents of rent caps also cite research showing such restrictions can reduce the number of available apartments and diminish overall affordability as tenants stay in rent-controlled units longer and some landlords decide to stop leasing properties. “Rent control is not a particularly effective way to help the families who need help with living expenses,” said Kelly Snider, a professor at San Jose State University’s Department of Urban and Regional Planning. “It’s sort of like a thin blanket that covers everyone when really you want thick blankets for the people who need it.” Biden’s proposal comes as local advocates have launched campaigns to put rent control on the November ballot in Berkeley, Redwood City, San Pablo, Pittsburg and Larkspur. At the state level, voters will be asked whether to repeal the law that prohibits cities from enacting rent control on newer apartment buildings and single-family homes. Snider with San Jose State said it was encouraging to see the president now also bringing housing policy up for debate after the federal government has largely ignored the issue in recent decades. “Anything that gets the conversation to go a little bit deeper is not a bad thing,” she said. Tom Li contributed reporting.","summary":"The proposal, coming at critical juncture in Biden's reelection campaign, would require approval by Congress.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/07/16/what-would-bidens-proposed-5-nationwide-rent-cap-mean-for-the-bay-area/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AP24196014109113_85e60a.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-16 23:43:21","author":"Ethan Varian","authors":["Ethan Varian"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.224},{"id":251934770,"title":"Joe Biden back in campaign mode against Donald Trump after shooting","text":"US President Joe Biden resumed political attacks against Donald Trump on Tuesday for the first time since the assassination attempt on his rival, as the Democrat sought to prop up his own faltering re-election bid. Biden did call anew for Americans to lower the temperature of their heated politics, and sought a ban on the type of gun used in the shooting at his Republican opponent’s political rally. But as he returned to the campaign trail with a speech to crucial black voters at the NAACP advocacy group in Las Vegas, Biden did not hold back against Trump, who was injured in the ear. Biden said Trump’s presidency had been “hell for black Americans”. Cheers erupted as the 81-year-old lashed out at the Republican for talking about “black jobs” during their recent debate – the same debate during which Biden gave a stumbling performance that has plunged his candidacy into crisis. “Folks, I know what a black job is – it’s the vice-president of the United States,” said Biden, referring to his running mate Kamala Harris, the first black and female VP. But he opened his speech by saying he was “grateful” that Trump was safe after the shooting, and said he wanted to renew efforts to ban the kind of semi-automatic rifle that shooter Thomas Matthew Crooks used. “Join me in getting these weapons of war off the streets of America. An AR-15 was used in the shooting of Donald Trump … It’s time to outlaw them,” Biden said. Biden’s renewed political focus on Trump comes as calls by some Democrats for him to step down after the debate, briefly silenced by the shooting, resumed. The Democratic National Committee meanwhile is pushing ahead with plans to rush through Biden’s own nomination ahead of its convention in August, despite calls to postpone the process. Biden’s campaign insisted the virtual roll-call was necessary before the August 19 convention, as Republican-led Ohio had moved its filing date to August 7 and Biden risked not being on the ballot there. “It is our obligation as a campaign to make sure that President Biden is on the ballot,” Biden deputy campaign manager Quentin Fulks told a press conference in Milwaukee. At the NAACP meeting in Las Vegas, there was widespread support for Biden staying on. “I found President Biden very full of energy,” said Donna Jackson-Houston, an NAACP member from California. She admitted that “I and many others had doubts” about Biden’s age and gaffes after the debate, but “he did a great job today convincing me”. Tony Fields from New Jersey said Biden’s speech was “very insightful,” adding that the bad debate was “just a moment that the President had that evening.” Biden, who says he “screwed up” due to jet lag and illness, forcefully defended his ability to do the job in a major US network interview on Monday night. “I’m old,” Biden told NBC. “But I’m only three years older than Trump, No 1. And No 2, my mental acuity has been pretty damn good.” Biden also defended his rhetoric about Trump after Republicans accused him of stoking divisions, although he admitted it was a “mistake” to tell donors in a call last week that it was “time to put Trump in the bullseye”.","summary":"The US president called for a ban on the type of gun used in the assassination bid, but did not hold back from political attacks on Trump.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3270722/joe-biden-back-campaign-mode-against-donald-trump-after-shooting","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/07/17/52c1006b-4325-402f-8d75-0f0f2e24ff81_c7ed7860.jpg","video":"https://storage.scmp.com/d8/cors_uploads/2024/07/16/160724-Trump%20Tshirts%20NY.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-16 23:39:57","author":"Agence France-Presse","authors":["Agence France-Presse"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.055},{"id":251934692,"title":"Biden is carefully reviewing suggestions on Supreme Court term limits and ethics code, according to sources from the Associated Press.","text":"WASHINGTON – President Joe Biden is seriously considering proposals to establish term limits for U.S. Supreme Court justices, and an ethics code that would be enforceable under law amid growing concerns that the justices are not held accountable, according to three people briefed on the plans. It would mark a major shift for Biden, the former head of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who has long resisted calls to reform the high court, though since taking office he has been increasingly vocal about his belief that the court is abandoning mainstream constitutional interpretation. The details were first reported by The Washington Post. Any changes would require congressional approval, which would be unlikely in a divided Congress. But with Republican nominee Donald Trump bragging about putting the three justices on the high court who are now part of the conservative majority, Biden’s call for major changes could help animate his voters. Biden is also considering calling for a constitutional amendment that would eliminate the broad immunity for presidents granted by the court in its most recent term, after Donald Trump claimed he was immune from prosecution for his actions on Jan. 6, 2021, when a mob of his supporters violently descended on the U.S. Capitol. The people were not authorized to speak publicly about proposals that have not been finalized and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. The consideration of such proposals comes in response to growing outrage among Democrats about high court opinions that overturned landmark decisions on abortion rights and federal regulatory powers that had stood for decades. There have also been increasing questions surrounding the ethics of the court after revelations about some of the justices, including that Clarence Thomas had accepted luxury trips from a GOP megadonor. The Supreme Court did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the proposal. Biden, speaking in a weekend call with the Congressional Progressive Caucus, talked about the possibility, the people said. Biden often tells voters they need more Democrats in Congress and a Democrat in the White House to counter the impact of the conservative-leaning court, but these proposals would go much further. “And by the way, I’m going to need your help on the Supreme Court, because I’m about to come out. I don’t want to prematurely announce it, but I’m about to come out with a major initiative on limiting the court and what we do and — I’ve been working with constitutional scholars for the last three months, and I need some help,” he said, according to a transcript of the call. About 2 in 3 Americans say they favor term limits or a mandatory retirement age for Supreme Court justices, according to a 2022 poll from the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. According to June survey on the court, confidence remains low: 4 in 10 U.S. adults say they have hardly any confidence in the people running the Supreme Court. The survey found that 7 in 10 Americans think the high court’s justices are more influenced by ideology, while only about 3 in 10 U.S. adults think the justices are more likely to provide an independent check on other branches of government by being fair and impartial. In November, the court adopted its first code of ethics. The policy, agreed to by all nine justices, does not appear to impose any significant new requirements and leaves compliance entirely to each justice. Republicans have focused for years on remaking the federal judiciary and Supreme Court. When Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., was the majority leader, he refused to even meet in 2016 with Obama’s pick for the high court — current Attorney General Merrick Garland, a federal judge at that time. The nomination stalled until a Republican president, Trump, took over. Establishment GOP operatives backed Trump because of his pledge to name as many judges to the bench as possible. Their gamble worked. Trump ended up with three Supreme Court nominees and 54 federal appeals court judges, reshaping the courts for a generation. Democrats are now finally understanding the power of judges as a voting tool, and Biden has made judicial nominations a priority, appointing a record number of judges for a president at this point in his first term, including some of the most diverse picks yet to the judiciary. Biden often speaks about those accomplishments during his reelection campaign, but Democrats have pushed him to go further.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nWASHINGTON – President Joe Biden is seriously considering proposals to establish term&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Biden is carefully reviewing suggestions on Supreme Court term limits and ethics code, according to sources from the Associated Press. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/biden-is-carefully-reviewing-suggestions-on-supreme-court-term-limits-and-ethics-code-according-to-sources-from-the-associated-press/","image":"https://www.clickorlando.com/resizer/ZEzqDoSjgIrUU1-KSd7Nvrq7mbY=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gmg/5T7GH6XIHFA6ZIX2VCZBIABBRA.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-16 23:36:59","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.179},{"id":251934842,"title":"PM to address UNGA session on Sept 26","text":"UNITED NATIONS, July 16: Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to address the high-level UN General Assembly session here on September 26, according to a provisional list of speakers issued by the UN.

They are telling a story in which the leading characters are the former president and his Republicans, and Joe Biden and his Democrats. The plot is about a nation on fire, a people at war with themselves, and so forth. Some have even depicted Sunday’s prime-time address by the president as if he were “bothsidesing” the issue of political violence. He wasn’t. Instead, Joe Biden listed examples of rightwing political violence. “Violence has never been the answer” to solving the problems of American democracy, he said, “whether it’s with members of Congress in both parties being targeted in the shot, or a violent mob attacking the Capitol on January 6th, or a brutal attack on the spouse of former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, or information and intimidation on election officials, or the kidnapping plot against a sitting governor, or an attempted assassination on Donald Trump.” That Biden listed examples of rightwing political violence seems to have gone over some heads. Ditto for the fact that he correctly included in those examples the attempted assassination of Trump. For some reason, it seems hard for members of the press and pundit corps to believe that America’s leading advocate of rightwing political violence could be a victim of it. And so dedicated are they to telling a story that blames both sides that it’s equally hard for them to believe Biden and the Democrats have nothing to do with it. There’s only one side to blame here. Trump and the GOP have reaped what they sowed. Soon after Donald Trump was whisked off the stage in Pennsylvania, the Republicans began creating conditions in which Biden and the Democrats seem to be responsible for Trump’s assassination attempt. US Senator JD Vance, of Ohio, is representative in this. “The central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs,” he said. “That rhetoric led directly to President Trump’s attempted assassination.” No, it didn’t. Calling out Donald Trump’s fascist tendencies is democratic politics. Characterizing him as a fraud, insurrectionist and rapist is based on fact. Saying a convicted felon shouldn’t be president is common sense. Only Trump and the Republicans are to blame for this. They were inciting rightwing political violence before as well as after the failed paramilitary takeover of the US government on January 6. (A shooter massacred Jews in Pittsburgh in 2018, Hispanics in El Paso in 2019, and Black people in Buffalo in 2022. Each echoed Trump’s rightwing views.) Though it has now come for one of their own, they won’t do any soul-searching. They can only blame their enemies for their own transgressions. And the press and pundit corps are playing along. I don’t know why the assassin, whom I will not name, did what he did. No one yet knows. As is the case with many or most shooters, we may never know his true motives. What we do know is he was a young, white man and a registered Republican, who was apparently steeped in a gun culture that habitually takes an insurrectionist view of the Second Amendment. Perhaps he was mentally ill. Perhaps he wanted to be infamous. Perhaps, like other rightwing shooters, he wanted to start a “race war.” Almost certain is he was a kook. Certain is he believed political violence is an acceptable alternative to democratic politics. I also know that looking at an attempted assassination out of its proper context is a good way to misunderstand it. Its proper context is this: the United States averages about one mass shooting a day, according to the Gun Violence Archive. This year, the total is expected to surpass 500, which would be the fifth time in five years that has happened. Such frequency is why the US surgeon general said, last month, that gun violence is a public health crisis. “People want to be able to walk through their neighborhoods and be safe,” Dr. Vivek Murthy told the Associated Press. “America should be a place where all of us can go to school, go to work, go to the supermarket, go to our house of worship, without having to worry that that’s going to put our life at risk.” (By the way, Pennsylvania is an open-carry state, and the shooter, who was shot and killed at the scene, obtained his semiautomatic rifle legally. That puts the Secret Service in a position in which it can’t do anything until there’s gunfire. The FBI, while investigating the crime as a potential act of domestic terrorism, said the shooter acted alone.) America should be that kind of place, but the Republicans have either stood in the way of federal gun-control legislation or they have, at the state level, expanded access to guns, even guns that are designed to kill in bulk, like the AR-15 semiautomatic rifle that killed a Trump supporter over the weekend and came close to killing Trump himself. The Democrats, meanwhile, have been united in trying to regulate access to guns and, in the process, in trying to thwart mass death. (More background: The Capitol police investigated more than 9,600 threats against congresspeople this year. That’s 10 times higher than eight years ago. And Robert P. Jones, head of Public Religion Research Institute, said: “We have been tracking an uptick in tolerance for political violence and an uptick in violent rhetoric in our national conversations over the last few years. Self-identified Republicans are three times more likely than Democrats to say they believe true American patriots may have to resort to violence to save the country.”) It seems no one is talking about Trump’s attempted assassination as part of a larger trend in gun violence in America. And because it seems no one is talking about it that way, no one seems to have noticed that the Republicans are upset about one of their own being a target of attempted murder while throwing up their hands in collective helplessness in every other case. Something must be done about the Democrats’ rhetoric, I guess, but nothing needed to be done, say, after a gunman entered a primary school to shoot 20 first graders to pieces. Given this context, it should not be surprising that Trump and the Republicans are themselves exceptionally vulnerable to rightwing political violence and threats of it. The policies they have enacted, and the anti-democratic attitudes they have popularized, have literally put them in life-threatening situations. Constantly feeling like their lives are in peril may explain why so many congressional Republicans, who had been reluctant to support Trump after the J6 insurrection, ultimately got in line. “Violence and threats against elected leaders are suppressing the emergence of a pro-democracy faction of the GOP,” wrote Rachel Kleinfeld, a political violence expert, in late 2022. The assassination of Trump was already part of rightwing political discourse. “Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and rightwing provocateur Ivan Raiklin have speculated for months that removing Trump from the running — they speculated about assassination — would open the way for Trump’s far-right former national security advisor Michael Flynn, and appeared to be putting pressure on Trump to name Flynn as vice president,” wrote Professor Heather Cox Richardon this morning. “Yesterday, Raiklin posted on social media a ‘Trump/Flynn 2024’ graphic with the legend ‘FAFO,’ under the words ‘Assassination-Proof.’” Biden and the Democrats, meanwhile, are the pro-democracy party. Not only are they against political violence, because it undermines and enfeebles democratic politics, but they are also not vulnerable to it like the Republicans are. As I said in February: “When a Democrat goes to a party function, they do not encounter other Democrats legally carrying semiautomatic rifles. A Republican, on the other hand, does. Someone calling you out for telling the truth about the big lie is one thing. When he’s slinging an AR-15 over his shoulder, it’s another.” The Washington press and pundit corps are this week working hard to convince you that the attempted assassination of Donald Trump is the superlative example of what happens when polarization goes too far. It isn’t. It’s what happens when you unleash rightwing political violence. Eventually, it comes for you.","summary":"The Washington press and pundit corps are this week working hard to convince you that the attempted assassination of Donald Trump is the superlative example of what happens when polarization goes too far. \n\nThey are telling a story in which the leading characters are the former president and his Republicans, and Joe Biden and his Democrats.

Instead, Joe Biden listed examples of rightwing political violence. “Violence has never been the answer” to solving the problems of American democracy, he said, “whether it’s with members of Congress in both parties being targeted in the shot, or a violent mob attacking the Capitol on January 6th, or a brutal attack on the spouse of former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, or information and intimidation on election officials, or the kidnapping plot","url":"https://www.alternet.org/alternet-exclusives/trump-political-violence/","image":"https://www.alternet.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=52820089&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C171","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-16 23:32:41","author":"John Stoehr","authors":["John Stoehr"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.518},{"id":251934562,"title":"Drinking Water Plan Celebrated by Joe Biden","text":"President Joe Biden touted his administration's effort to remove \"every poisonous lead pipe\" in American households during his speech at the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) National Convention on Tuesday afternoon in Las Vegas.Biden delivered the keynote address at the convention.

The funding is to, the White House said in a statement, \"build new deeply-affordable homes, spur economic development, and revitalize neighborhoods in communities across the country.\"They join current grantees in Phoenix, Arizona; Shreveport and Baton Rouge in Louisiana; Cleveland, Ohio; Camden, New Jersey; Winston-Salem, North Carolina; Lewiston, Maine and Norfolk, Virginia. These cities received a total additional $19.5 million from the new award, according to HUD.\"The awards will build over 6,500 units of new housing, support small businesses, build childcare centers and new parks, and will be used to leverage more than $2.65 billion in additional public and private investments in these neighborhoods,\" the White House said.Housing costs have emerged as a key issue for Americans as soaring mortgages coupled with elevated prices have made owning a home beyond the reach of a huge swath of Americans.

New campaign finance reports filed this week finally revealed that most of the money came from allies of former San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo. The March primary race to replace U.S. Rep. Anna Eshoo ended with Liccardo in first place and Santa Clara County Supervisor Joe Simitian and Assemblymember Evan Low tied for second. But then, Jonathan Padilla, a former Liccardo mayoral campaign staffer and 2020 and 2024 Biden delegate, requested a recount of the more than 182,000 votes cast in the race. What followed was two-and-a-half weeks of nail-biting vote counting in Santa Clara and San Mateo counties, where the district is located, and Low emerging victorious by five votes. The recount, however, came at a cost with each county charging $12,000 a day. The money came from a newly-established Super PAC called Count the Vote, which prompted local politicos — including Eshoo herself — to demand the group immediately disclose the donors instead of waiting until the July 15 deadline mandated by the Federal Election Commission. In May, election filings revealed that Neighbors for Results, a pro-Liccardo Super PAC, transferred $102,000 into Count the Vote. The PAC has three donors: former NetApp CEO Daniel Warmenhoven, former New York City mayor and billionaire philanthropist Michael Bloomberg and Cypress Semiconductor founder Thurman John Rodgers. Bloomberg was the largest donor, shelling out $500,000 to the PAC in February. But that was only part of the picture. New election filings show that Count the Vote had five other donors aside from Neighbors for Results: Ripple co-founder Christian Larsen, Warmenhoven, Metropolitan Transportation Commission Vice Chair Nick Josefowitz, K McAuliffe and Padilla. The five contributions totaled $169,500. Larry Gerston, a professor emeritus of political science at San Jose State University, said the number of donors doesn’t come as a surprise. “That’s not unusual because you have to have a sizable check available and this kind of money is not the discretionary funds that mom and pop contributors have.” Count the Vote ultimately raised $271,500 and spent $268,000 on the recount and still owes $50,112 to its attorneys at Rutan and Tucker. Larsen, who Forbes estimates has a net worth of $3.2 billion, gave the PAC its largest check — $100,000. The cryptocurrency businessman also has been a major donor to Democrats nationally and has played a role in Silicon Valley politics, shelling out tens of thousands of dollars in recent elections for PACs backing San Jose Mayor Matt Mahan, Santa Clara County Supervisor Cindy Chavez’s failed mayoral bid and a 2018 San Jose ballot measure endorsed by Liccardo. Warmenhoven, who gave $50,000 to Neighbors for Results earlier this year, donated $63,500 to Count the Vote. In the past, the former NetApp CEO has contributed to Mahan and Liccardo’s mayoral campaigns. Warmenhoven also gave Liccardo the $6,600 maximum to his congressional campaign. McAuliffe as well as Josefowitz — the former chief of policy for urban think tank SPUR who has previously donated to Liccardo — gave relatively smaller donations of $2,500. Padilla also contributed $1,000 to the recount he requested. A spokesperson for Liccardo declined to comment, referring this news organization to an op-ed the former mayor published in April. In it, Liccardo calls for an automatic recount provision and said that he had no communication with Padilla or other donors to the recount. “In addition to whatever commendable desire he might have to ensure an accurate count of every vote, we can presume that Padilla (and likely others) also did this for political reasons,” Liccardo wrote. “If true, that hardly renders Padilla’s recount request illegitimate; it merely puts it in the same category as every other recount request in U.S. electoral history. Elections are politically competitive.” Low’s campaign was highly critical of the recount, even going as far as calling it a “page right out of Trump’s political playbook.” In a statement on Tuesday afternoon, his campaign doubled down. “The recount was nothing more than a dirty trick, and it’s now clear Liccardo’s billionaire donors funded it, which hamstrung our fundraising and gave Trump Republicans a playbook to continue to undermine our democracy,” campaign spokesperson Lindsey Cobia said. Low’s campaign ended up spending $168,369 on the recount, according to recent election filings. Padilla defended the recount and criticized Low for independent expenditures, which he has no control of, spent on his behalf. During the primary election, the Golden State Leadership Fund PAC, which had major funding from PG&E and the California Apartment Association, spent hundreds of thousands of dollars backing Low. “Evan Low fought like hell to prevent an accurate vote count going as far to threaten a lawsuit to stop the vote and now he’s pushing a double standard to hide the contributions of his corporate paymasters like PG&E as long as possible,” Padilla said. “It’s the epitome of hypocrisy, but that’s to be expected from someone on the dole of special interests like PG&E who funnel more and more money to his candidacy while gouging ratepayers.”","summary":"The Count the Vote PAC had five individual donors and money from one other pro-Liccardo PAC.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/07/16/heres-who-funded-the-congressional-district-16-recount/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SJM-L-VOTECOUNT-7.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-16 23:27:34","author":"Grace Hase","authors":["Grace Hase"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.315},{"id":251934506,"title":"Trump Faithful See God's Hand In Assassination Escape","text":"Devotees of Donald Trump have long proclaimed he was chosen by God to save the United States -- but the messianic fervor has hit new heights after the Republican presidential candidate narrowly survived an assassination attempt.At the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee this week, the party faithful have been quick to credit divine intervention with saving their leader's life after he was wounded in a shooting at his Pennsylvania rally.Images of the bloodied former president raising his fist defiantly in the air as the Stars and Stripes fluttered in the background have only served to bolster his image among his supporters.\"Evil came for the man we admire and love so much,\" said the right-wing firebrand Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene. \"I thank God that his hand was on President Trump.\"House Speaker Mike Johnson told a news channel that Trump's escape, with only a slight ear wound, was \"a miraculous thing,\" while Senator Marco Rubio of Florida wrote on X that \"God protected Trump.\"Former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, currently serving a prison sentence for contempt of Congress, said \"Trump wears the Armor of God.\"Never mind that one rally-goer was killed -- a volunteer firefighter who died shielding his family -- while two others were seriously wounded.Nor that, until his foray into Republican politics, tycoon Trump displayed a distaste for religion, even mocking believers, according to a former aide.He also boasted in one of his books about affairs with \"beautiful, famous, successful, married\" women, and has been found liable by a civil court for sexual abuse.Trump, who has said he was raised Presbyterian but now considers himself a \"non-denominational Christian,\" has encouraged the attention, writing on Truth Social that \"God alone who prevented the unthinkable from happening.\"For Natasha Lindstaedt, a political scientist at the University of Essex, the episode underscores the cult of personality that Trump and his inner circle have meticulously cultivated and reinforced over several years. Some \"personalist\" leaders are dictators, others are elected, but their goal is the same: \"To get people to blindly obey them and to be mystified by their superhuman qualities,\" she told AFP.

He paid a $92 million bond while appealing a guilty verdict in a defamation case in April, then the following month posted a $175 million bond while appealing a civil fraud lawsuit. The month after that, in May, he endured his first criminal trial, which ended with the former president being found guilty of 34 felony counts. Things have since seemed to turn around for the Republican nominee. The Supreme Court essentially ruled that presidents are above the law while in office, throwing a wrench into the legal action against him. Then, in the days following the failed assassination attempt against him on Saturday, Trump received welcome news from Florida when Judge Aileen Cannon threw out the Justice Department’s classified documents case against him. The good news didn’t stop there: On Tuesday, an appeal hearing for his racketeering and election fraud case in Georgia was moved until after the November election. The hearing follows a two-year investigation by the Fulton County District Attorney’s office, which indicted Trump and 18 co-defendants on racketeering, conspiracy and election fraud charges in a case that alleges he and the co-defendants sought to overturn Joe Biden’s victory in Georgia. Trump, who has pleaded not guilty, has pushed to remove Fulton County DA Fani Willis from the case after it was discovered she had a romantic relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade. In March, Fulton County Judge Scott McAfee said although he did not believe Willis’ relationship with Wade amounted to any conflict of interest, he said it created an “appearance of impropriety” for the prosecution and ruled that either Willis or Wade must step down. Wade left, allowing Willis to remain on the case. McAfee also allowed Trump to appeal Willis’ involvement in the case, which he of course did. Arguments were originally set to Oct. 4, but on Tuesday, they were moved to Dec. 5. The Fulton County case is just one of four criminal cases involving Trump. Special Counsel Jack Smith is investigating Trump over his actions that led up to the deadly riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and indicted Trump on charges related to the effort to overturn the election results. Smith is also appealing Judge Cannon’s dismissal of the classified documents case in Florida. In New York in May, Trump was found guilty by a jury of his peers of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. Sentencing was originally scheduled for July 11 but was rescheduled to at least Sept. 18 after Judge Juan Merchan decided he would weigh the possible impact of the immunity case, which was decided a day before Judge Merchan rescheduled sentencing.","summary":"The former president gets more good news","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/appeal-hearing-trump-georgia-case-moved-election-1235061971/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Fani-Willis-trump-georgia.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-16 23:26:05","author":"Catherina Gioino,Ryan Bort","authors":["Catherina Gioino","Ryan Bort"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.366},{"id":251935142,"title":"Biden says it’s ‘time to outlaw’ AR-15 after Trump assassination attempt","text":"President Joe Biden renewed his demand for Congress to ban high-powered firearms such as the AR-15-style rifle that a gunman used to shoot Donald Trump. “An AR-15 was used in the shooting of Donald Trump, just as other assault weapons were used to kill so many others, including children,” he said in remarks to the NAACP’s 115th national convention in Las Vegas on Tuesday. “It’s time to outlaw them. I did it once and I will do it again.” The Public Safety and Recreational Firearms Use Protection Act, which imposed the so-called assault weapons ban, was enacted in 1994. That law expired in 2004, and Congress has repeatedly decided not to renew it. Biden repeated his call to “lower the temperature” in American politics and to “reject violence of any kind,” including the attempted assassination of his Republican rival, threats to Black election workers, and the victims of gun violence “that never make the news.” “If we’re gonna speak about violence, we’re gonna speak about guns. More children in America died of gunshot wounds than any other reason. That is sick,” he said. “And it’s sheer cowardice if we do nothing about it,” Biden added. “So, you wanna stand against violence in America, then join me in getting these weapons of war off the streets of America. An AR-15 was used in the shooting of Donald Trump, just as other assault weapons used to kill so many others, including children. It’s time to outlaw them. I did it once and I will do it again.” Since taking office, Biden has made more than 70 calls to Congress to renew the assault weapons ban, which would target the most popular gun in America. The 20-year-old suspected gunman, Thomas Matthew Crooks, could legally purchase rifles like the AR-15 in Pennsylvania, as shotguns and rifles can be purchased in the state at age 18. The minimum age to purchase handguns in Pennsylvania is 21. The firearm recovered at the scene was allegedly legally purchased by the suspect’s father. About one in 20 adults — roughly 16 million Americans — own at least one AR-15-style rifle, according to polling from Ipsos and The Washington Post. The rifles — which were initially developed as a military weapon before becoming the most popular gun in America — have also been used in at least 10 of the 17 deadliest mass shootings since 2012. Trump has rejected calls to renew the assault weapons ban. During an address to the National Rifle Association in May, Trump claimed that the Second Amendment “is very much on the ballot” and baselessly alleged that Biden is “trying to rip firearms out of the hands of law-abiding citizens.” The message in Biden’s address on Tuesday — amid growing calls from voters and Democratic officials to end his re-election campaign — sought to contrast his agenda against Trump’s in front of an influential civil rights group with powerful reach to Black voters. He outlined the Trump-allied Project 2025 plan for the former president’s second term, highlighting proposed policy changes that would disproportionately impact Black Americans. Biden vowed to renew the Voting Rights Act and enshrine Roe v Wade into law, actions that he would need a Democratically controlled Congress to do. He also pointed to Republican-led threats to Social Security and Medicare, “risking people’s lives,” and the Heritage Foundation-backed proposal to eliminate the Department of Education. “You ought to read it — saying it’s a state issue. Give me a break,” Biden said. He mentioned Republican proposed cuts to federal early education programs for children from low-income families, and warned that “they’ve already eviscerated affirmative action” and will “also decimate diversity, equity, inclusion, across all America. Republican lawmakers are “trying to erase Black history — Black history is American history,” Biden said. “I’m not being dramatic. We cannot let that happen,” he said. “That’s why it was so important to me to make Juneteenth a federal holiday. We can’t erase it.”","summary":"The president demanded Congress renew the federal assault weapons ban that his Republican rival has rejected","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-shooting-biden-assault-weapons-ar15-b2580981.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/07/16/23/2162320136.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/JGsSIFWI-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-16 23:25:48","author":"Alex Woodward","authors":["Alex Woodward"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.058},{"id":251934324,"title":"Joe Biden, Losing Black Support, Hammers Trump Over 'Black Jobs'","text":"President Joe Biden criticized former President Donald Trump over a \"Black jobs\" comment as he sought to hold onto voters who have shifted away from the incumbent since helping him win the White House four years ago.Biden addressed the NAACP convention in Las Vegas on Tuesday, making his return to the campaign trail for the first time since Saturday's attempted assassination of Trump. During his speech, Biden wished his Republican rival well, saying he was \"grateful\" that he wasn't seriously injured in the shooting but also used the opportunity to go after Trump's remarks about Black Americans.While Biden's performance emerged as the focal point of the June 27 presidential debate, Trump drew some flack for saying that migrants were taking \"Black jobs.\"\"I love his phrase 'Black jobs.' Tells a lot about the man and about his character,\" Biden told the crowd Tuesday. \"Folks, I know what a Black job is, it's a vice president of the United States!\"Biden's appeal to Black voters, who are a tentpole for the Democratic Party, comes as early data suggests that they're shifting away from the president.A Pew Research study found that while Black voters remain overwhelmingly Democratic and continue to support Biden over Trump by a wide margin, the president's advantage has shrunk 16 percentage points since the 2020 election.As of April, 77 percent of Black voters say they would vote for or lean toward Biden. In 2020, 92 percent of Black voters said the same. Black support for Biden in the upcoming election is also lower than support for Hillary Clinton in 2016.A Washington Post/Ipsos survey from last month found that support for Biden among Black voters had fallen 7 percentage points since 2022. It also offered some good news for Trump, with 77 percent of Black Americans agreeing that Trump is biased against Black people—a 10-point drop from 2020.Additionally, Biden's approval rating among Black adults has dropped from 94 percent when he started his term to 55 percent in March, according to an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll.The NAACP conference is the latest event that Biden has appeared at as part of a summer-long outreach initiative to Black voters across the nation. Earlier this year, he delivered a commencement address at Morehouse College and courted Black voters in the battleground states of Pennsylvania and Michigan. He was also expected to participate in an interview with BET on Tuesday.During his speech, Biden touted his appointments, noting that he picked the first Black vice president to serve alongside him and that he appointed the first Black woman to the U.S. Supreme Court. He also reminded voters that he served as the vice president to the first Black president in U.S. history.\"I promised myself and I promised America that my administration would look like America,\" Biden told the crowd at the NAACP conference. \"I'm proud that we have the most diverse administration in all history that taps into the full talents of the nation.\"He also contrasted himself to Trump, whom he said made the country \"hell\" for Black Americans. Biden argued that Trump's efforts to repeal Obamacare, his \"mismanagement\" of the COVID-19 pandemic and his response to the Black Lives Matter movement were \"devastating to Black communities,\" and recalled how Trump promoted the birtherism conspiracy theory about Obama's birthplace.\"What the hell is the matter with this man?\" Biden asked. \"I'm serious. Go figure, from a guy who spread the birtherism lie against Barack Obama saying he wasn't born in America and he wasn't a U.S. citizen.\"During last month's debate, Trump said that Biden's \"big kill\" against Black Americans was the influx of migrants who have crossed the U.S.-Mexico border since Biden took office.\"They're taking Black jobs and they're taking Hispanic jobs. And you haven't seen it yet, but you're going to see something that's going to be the worst in our history,\" Trump said.The remark was widely criticized by prominent Black leaders, including Derrick Johnson, president and CEO of the NAACP, who called it a \"misinformed characterization\" that denied \"the ubiquity of Black talent.\"\"There is no such thing as a Black job,\" Johnson said, adding that \"A 'Black job' is an American job. It's concerning that a presidential candidate would seek to make a nonexistent distinction.

Specific details of the proposal — or when it might be officially announced — were not immediately available.The Supreme Court has an existing code of conduct, rolled out last November, which outlines when a sitting Justice should recuse themselves from a case and when outside activities may create the appearance of a conflict of interest. However, unlike the code that binds lower court justices, the Supreme Court's ethics code lacks any enforcement mechanism. It requires sitting Justices to regulate themselves, with critics regarding the measures as toothless against the court's lifetime appointees.Most changes to the Supreme Court would require congressional approval to enact, so Biden is turning to his allies in the House and Senate for help, the Post reported.\"I'm going to need your help on the Supreme Court, because I'm about to come out — I don't want to prematurely announce it — but I'm about to come out with a major initiative on limiting the court,\" the Post reported Biden said, according to a transcript of a Saturday call with the Congressional Progressive Caucus. \"I've been working with constitutional scholars for the last three months, and I need some help.\"Representatives for the Biden administration and Supreme Court did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.The proposals would appear to be an attempt to restrain the Supreme Court's expanding power and balance the polarized conservative court without adding new Justices to the bench.Biden has rejected calls to expand the Supreme Court for years, despite arguments to do so amid ongoing ethics concerns facing the Court.Justice Clarence Thomas has been the subject of intense scrutiny following reports that he accepted lavish gifts and vacations from Republican megadonor Harlan Crow.Justice Samuel Alito has also been sharply criticized after it was discovered that a Revolutionary-era \"Appeal to Heaven\" flag, regarded as a pro-Trump symbol, was flying for weeks over his New Jersey vacation home last summer.Two Democratic Senators earlier this month called for a special counsel to investigate Thomas over allegations of tax fraud and failure to disclose gifts from Crow he had been given.Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has filed articles of impeachment against both Thomas and Alito on ethical grounds, citing their refusal to recuse themselves from cases they may be connected to, and Thomas' undisclosed gifts. The move followed the Supreme Court's decision granting former President Donald Trump wide-reaching immunity for acts taken during his administration.","summary":"Biden plans to announce a proposal that would establish term limits and a new ethics code targeting the Supreme Court, The Washington Post reported.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/joe-biden-plans-term-limits-new-ethics-code-supreme-court-2024-7","image":"https://i.insider.com/6696eadf5439fb59cebdef5b?width=1136&format=jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-16 23:23:03","author":"Katherine Tangalakis-Lippert","authors":["Katherine Tangalakis-Lippert"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.277},{"id":251934362,"title":"Biden Gets Animated in Las Vegas, Struggles with Teleprompter, and Supports BLM Protests at NAACP Event.","text":"Desperate to turn around his collapsing re-election effort, Joe Biden is hitting at the far-left highlights as we head into the thick of campaign season.

In his recent interview with Lester Holt, Biden was also angry in his pronouncements. It comes across as completely unhinged. Why does he continue to do it? I can only suspect that he believes it makes him appear strong and in charge.

It’s so common at this point that I almost dread writing these articles. How much can be said about the president being completely gone? Yet, in the lead-up to the election, American voters must see Biden for who he is. The stakes are too high so I’ll keep popping migraine pills and reporting on this stuff. Biden did mention his new rent control plan, which is objectively insane. Biden claims he’s “gonna bring rents down,” then forgets what he’s talking about. Yikes! pic.twitter.com/C2hWrmCVni— RNC Research (@RNCResearch) July 16, 2024 Forget his brain being mush. Price controls destroy economies. They bring about the total collapse of entire nations. The idea that the federal government is going to cap rent hikes at five percent a year is absurd. It’s the kind of plan a desperate, deranged man would come up with because he knows he’s losing badly. If it were to succeed in being implemented, it would force the largest housing crisis in history as investors would stop building new units. Speaking of deranged, Biden actually told the crowd that it is Republicans who “want to prosecute political enemies.” Of note is that the president is currently prosecuting his political enemies while Donald Trump never did so when he was in office, letting Hillary Clinton walk. BIDEN: “They want to prosecute political enemies!”THAT’S EXACTLY WHAT DEMOCRATS HAVE DONE. pic.twitter.com/ZOF1m1NiIZ— RNC Research (@RNCResearch) July 16, 2024 Being that shameless takes effort. I’ll give him that. Continuing that thought, Biden actually tried to claim that he’s making home ownership affordable. I almost fell out of my chair when I saw this clip. Biden says he’s “putting homeownership in reach,” even as his policies have DESTROYED the American Dream pic.twitter.com/vEAHs1wBhW— RNC Research (@RNCResearch) July 16, 2024 Mortgage interest rates have risen from the mid-two percent range to over seven percent under Biden. Ask me how I know. In many cases, that translates to nearly doubling the monthly note that one would have paid during the last year of the Trump administration. For Biden to try to steal valor on that point is the kind of gross politics that people are sick and tired of. With that said, I’ll end with this pander-bear clip of the president praising the BLM riots that destroyed entire city blocks in 2020. Biden says the 2020 “Summer of Love” riots — in which entire city blocks were destroyed and livelihoods were upended — were just peaceful protests pic.twitter.com/UkjSpVKe0l— RNC Research (@RNCResearch) July 16, 2024 Voters need to ask themselves whether they are willing to live through that again because Biden has zero intention of stopping any rioting if it occurs.

She has repeatedly said that Trump represents an existential threat to democracy who must be defeated in November, a feat Democrats are not certain Biden can accomplish as questions about his mental fitness for office continue. Pelosi, a longtime Biden ally, is now \"convinced\" Biden remaining on the ticket would cost her party the White House, according to a stunning Politico report published on Monday. \"Pelosi, convinced Biden will lose, has been working the phones since June 27 in hopes of finding a way to ease him off the ticket,\" Politico reported. PELOSI IGNORES BIDEN'S DECISION TO STAY IN THE RACE IN LATEST SIGN OF DEMOCRAT FRACTURE \"One of her colleagues was struck to see her chatting, furtively but openly, with Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries last week in a corner of the House Democratic cloakroom in plain sight of a dozen lawmakers,\" Politico continued. \"The extent of Pelosi’s behind-the-scenes role hasn’t been fully revealed and may never be if the former speaker has her way.\" \"But I’m told by people familiar with the exchanges that she’s stage-managed phone calls to Jeffries, plotted strategy with the biggest names in Democratic politics and told one former elected official bluntly that Biden’s legacy can’t be destroying their party,\" the report said. Politico noted that this occurred prior to the assassination attempt on Trump. Pelosi’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Biden has insisted he will remain in the race, but Pelosi last week insinuated that there is still a decision to be made. \"It's up to the president to decide if he is going to run. We are all encouraging him to make that decision because time is running short,\" Pelosi told MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" on Wednesday. \"He's beloved, he's respected, and people want him to make that decision.\" Many took her comments as a sign that she wants Biden to drop out.

CNN reported that US authorities received intelligence from a \"human source\" on a plan by Tehran targeting the former president, causing protection to be boosted for Trump. Other US outlets also reported the plot. But it was not connected to the shooting at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, in which gunman Thomas Matthew Crooks opened fire at Trump, leaving the Republican wounded and killing a rally attendee, they said. The US National Security Council said it had been \"tracking Iranian threats against former Trump administration officials for years\" as Tehran sought revenge for the 2020 killing of Revolutionary Guards commander Qasem Soleimani. \"We consider this a national and homeland security matter of the highest priority,\" spokeswoman Adrienne Watson said in a statement. The investigation into the Trump shooting on Saturday \"has not identified ties between the shooter and any accomplice or co-conspirator, foreign or domestic,\" she added. Watson referred questions on \"additional measures that have been implemented in recent weeks\" to the Secret Service and Department of Homeland Security. Top Secret Service spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said they and other agencies were \"constantly receiving new potential threat information and taking action to adjust resources as needed.\" \"We cannot comment on any specific threat stream other than to say that the Secret Service takes threats seriously and responds accordingly,\" Guglielmi added in a statement. There was no immediate reaction from the Department of Homeland Security. The report comes as the Secret Service faces intense scrutiny over the Butler shooting, with questions over how a gunman was able to open fire at Trump from an exposed rooftop some 150 meters (500 feet) away. US President Joe Biden has ordered an independent review of the agency's handling of the incident.

Gass caused controversy on Sunday night when he made a joke on stage in Sydney about the attempted assassination of the former American president. During their show, Black brought a birthday cake out for Gass and asked him to make a wish, prompting him to reply ‘Don’t miss Trump next time.’ His comment came hours after the attempted assassination of Trump at a rally in Milwaukee, Pennsylvania, in a shooting which pierced Trump’s right ear and killed one spectator. Fans have now slammed Black for claiming he was blindsided by his Tenacious D bandmate’s tasteless comments and cancelling the comedy band’s tour. ‘Jack Black turning on Kyle Gass is legitimately upsetting to me, I’m gonna have to take a long walk,’ one person wrote on X. ‘You’re upset at Jack Black because of what Kyle Gass said. I’m upset at Jack Black for turning his back on a 30 year long partnership for the sake of keeping his celebrity status,’ another commented. Another unimpressed fan said: ‘Not Jack Black throwing Kyle Gass under the bus for making a joke about Trump. What an absolute coward.’ ‘There’s GOT to be more to this Tenacious D thing. You don’t end a relationship like that and screw up the livelihoods of your crew over a joke. Like, what’s tea?’ one said. ‘Jack Black should not be praised. Kyle Gass was the sacrificial lamb,’ another wrote. The School of Rock actor issued a statement on Tuesday, saying he has decided to cancel the comedy band’s tour – and that all creative plans are on hold – after Gass expressed that he wished Trump’s would-be assassin hadn’t missed. His decision comes just one month after Black delivered a speech at a star-studded fundraiser in Los Angeles for President Joe Biden, where he said ‘democracy was at stake’ in November’s election. Democrats have been criticised for raising the political temperature in America by claiming a Trump presidency would be a threat to democracy. ‘I was blindsided by what was said at the show on Sunday. I would never condone hate speech or encourage political violence in any form,’ Black told DailyMail.com in a statement. ‘After much reflection, I no longer feel it is appropriate to continue the Tenacious D tour, and all future creative plans are on hold. I am grateful to the fans for their support and understanding.’ The incident has since prompted divisive reactions online, with Kyle Sandilands banning Tenacious D from his radio show for life in light of the comment. Speaking on Tuesday’s Kyle & Jackie O show, radio host Sandilands said: ‘So, that guy wishes death on Trump.’ ‘A note to our talent bookers, I will not be participating in any future Tenacious D interviews,’ he went on. ‘Someone wishing someone dead that nearly got assassinated, all jokes aside, it’s too much for me. Anyone who wishes someone else dead, legit is just a piece of s**t.’ Frontier Touring has announced refunds for all Tenacious D ticket holders. The concert promoter confirmed on Wednesday morning that shows in Newcastle, Brisbane, Melbourne, Adelaide, Wellington, and Auckland were cancelled. ‘Frontier Touring regret to advise that the remaining dates of Tenacious D’s tour of Australia and New Zealand have been cancelled,’ they wrote. ‘Ticket holders who purchased tickets via authorised ticketing outlets will receive a full refund.

The proposals under serious consideration include legislation to establish term limits for justices and establishing an updated code of ethics that would be binding and enforceable, a source said. The policies, which haven't been finalized, may be rolled out in the coming weeks, which would be a new approach for a president who has long been skeptical of restructuring the Supreme Court. A White House spokesperson declined to comment. Biden told lawmakers in the Congressional Progressive Caucus during a virtual meeting Saturday that he had been consulting constitutional scholars on the matter for more than a month, according to a person familiar with the discussion. “I’m going to need your help to and advice on how we should be doing what I’m going to be doing there. Want to make sure we have a closer working relationship, because we’re in this together,” Biden told the lawmakers, though he didn’t get into specific policy substance, the source said. The Washington Post first reported Biden’s plans. Two other sources told NBC News that Biden told the lawmakers he will come out for big reforms, without giving them details, but that members on the call understood him to be referring to term limits and ethics rules. The call took place Saturday before the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump at a Pennsylvania rally. “Look, it’s not, it’s not hyperbole to suggest Trump is literally an existential threat, an existential threat to the very constitution of democracy we, we say we care about. And I mean if this guy wins, he’s not, and now, especially with that Supreme Court giving him the kind of breadth of — I don’t need to get into the Supreme Court right now — anyway, but I need your help,” Biden said. Changing the structure of the Supreme Court would require Congress to make a new law. That's extremely unlikely while Republicans control the House, as the party is pleased with the 6-3 conservative majority it has built on the high court. But the proposals could become a useful messaging device for Biden on the campaign trail. And if Democrats sweep the election, they may have a fighting chance of passing. Democrats have rallied voters against the Supreme Court, citing unpopular rulings like the elimination of federal abortion rights and a spate of recent reports detailing apparent ethical lapses among some of the justices. Last month, Senate Democrats sought to pass Supreme Court ethics legislation but ran into Republican opposition. In the House, Reps. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., and Don Beyer, D-Va., have lintroduced legislation that would impose 18-year term limits for future justices, ultimately creating vacancies to fill during every four-year presidential term and preventing retirements for partisan reasons. Khanna praised Biden for warming up to the idea, noting that he first introduced term limits legislation in 2020. “Since then, we have been advocating for the president to champion this reform,\" Khanna told NBC News on Tuesday. \"It is a big step for him to now call for commonsense term limits for the court and a judicial code of ethics.”","summary":"The president is considering backing term limits for justices and a binding code of ethics, sources say.

But with Republican nominee Donald Trump bragging about putting the three justices on the high court who are now part of the conservative majority, Biden’s call for major changes could help animate his voters. Biden is also considering calling for a constitutional amendment that would eliminate the broad immunity for presidents granted by the court in its most recent term, after Donald Trump claimed he was immune from prosecution for his actions on Jan. 6, 2021, when a mob of his supporters violently descended on the U.S. Capitol. The people were not authorized to speak publicly about proposals that have not been finalized and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. The consideration of such proposals comes in response to growing outrage among Democrats about high court opinions that overturned landmark decisions on abortion rights and federal regulatory powers that had stood for decades. There have also been increasing questions surrounding the ethics of the court after revelations about some of the justices, including that Clarence Thomas had accepted luxury trips from a GOP megadonor. The Supreme Court did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the proposal. Biden, speaking in a weekend call with the Congressional Progressive Caucus, talked about the possibility, the people said. Biden often tells voters they need more Democrats in Congress and a Democrat in the White House to counter the impact of the conservative-leaning court, but these proposals would go much further. “And by the way, I’m going to need your help on the Supreme Court, because I’m about to come out. I don’t want to prematurely announce it, but I’m about to come out with a major initiative on limiting the court and what we do and — I’ve been working with constitutional scholars for the last three months, and I need some help,” he said, according to a transcript of the call. About 2 in 3 Americans say they favor term limits or a mandatory retirement age for Supreme Court justices, according to a 2022 poll from the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. According to June survey on the court, confidence remains low: 4 in 10 U.S. adults say they have hardly any confidence in the people running the Supreme Court. The survey found that 7 in 10 Americans think the high court’s justices are more influenced by ideology, while only about 3 in 10 U.S. adults think the justices are more likely to provide an independent check on other branches of government by being fair and impartial. In November, the court adopted its first code of ethics. The policy, agreed to by all nine justices, does not appear to impose any significant new requirements and leaves compliance entirely to each justice. Republicans have focused for years on remaking the federal judiciary and Supreme Court. When Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., was the majority leader, he refused to even meet in 2016 with Obama’s pick for the high court — current Attorney General Merrick Garland, a federal judge at that time. The nomination stalled until a Republican president, Trump, took over. Establishment GOP operatives backed Trump because of his pledge to name as many judges to the bench as possible. Their gamble worked. Trump ended up with three Supreme Court nominees and 54 federal appeals court judges, reshaping the courts for a generation. Democrats are now finally understanding the power of judges as a voting tool, and Biden has made judicial nominations a priority, appointing a record number of judges for a president at this point in his first term, including some of the most diverse picks yet to the judiciary.

His remarks on U.S. gun control policies at his morning press conference came in response to a question about the assassination attempt on Trump in Pennsylvania on Saturday and the 20-year-old shooter’s ease of access to guns. “I believe that controlling the sale of guns in the United States would help a lot,” López Obrador said. “It’s something that needs to be done urgently.” López Obrador also said that if “the two candidates” for the United States presidency were to sign “a commitment to regulate the sale of guns” should they win a second term, it “would be a well-regarded act by Americans.” “It would be an act of good faith in the quest for unity and peace, a first step,” he said. AMLO added that “other causes” of gun violence in the U.S. have to be addressed as well “because this is a social crisis.” “It has to be combatted, they have to get to the bottom of it, they have to return to the morals of the founders of that great nation. I believe that … [those morals] have been lost, and there is social decay,” he said. López Obrador said that about 50,000 guns have been seized by authorities in Mexico since he took office in late 2018, and highlighted that “approximately 75%” of them were smuggled into the country from the United States. “There is no control of guns [in the U.S.]. If we confiscated 50,000, imagine how many are coming in because we can’t seize them all. … And in the United States you can buy them in a supermarket; that can’t go on,” he said. In Mexico, guns can only be purchased legally at one store operated by the army in the metropolitan area of Mexico City. While random mass shootings in places such as schools and shopping centers are extremely rare in Mexico, targeted killings occur regularly, including in bars, and overall homicide numbers are significantly higher than in the U.S. Political violence is also a major problem in Mexico. The majority of homicides in Mexico are committed with firearms illegally brought into Mexico from the United States, a crime the Mexican government wants its U.S. counterpart to do more to combat. In addition to advocating stricter gun control in the United States, López Obrador on Tuesday once again expressed relief that Trump wasn’t killed when a gunman shot at him as he spoke at a rally on Saturday evening. “We feel good that nothing happened to former president Trump,” he said before acknowledging the “friendship” he and his government have with the 78-year-old Republican currently vying to return to the White House for a second term. “I won’t forget that when I got COVID on one occasion he called me and sent me a packet of medicine. … I was already being treated, so I turned it over to the nutrition institute,” he said, referring to the National Institute of Medical Sciences and Nutrition. “He was no longer president, but he demonstrated that kindness,” López Obrador said.

This is our chance to continue the incredible pro-Israel legacy of the most pro-Israel president in history — Donald J. Trump,” he said, to cheers. “They said [it] couldn’t be done. … He moved the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem. They said it couldn’t be done, but he weakened the Iranian regime. They said it couldn’t be done, but he delivered the historic Abraham Accords, bringing us closer to peace in the Middle East. With President Trump we will repair and rebuild the U.S.-Israel relationship that has deteriorated after four disastrous years under President Biden.” Brooks noted that Biden is still withholding some weapons from Israel — and the crowd booed. “There is only one pro-Israel party,” Brooks concluded, “and it’s the Republican Party. “And here at home, under Donald Trump, we will put a stop to the rising tide of antisemitism. President Trump will bring back law and order, so that American Jews can once again wear a kippah and walk the streets without fear. President Trump will stop the mobs on college campuses so Jewish students feel safe when they go to class.” He also said Trump would “stand up to the Hamas sympathizers and the Sqaud,” referring to anti-Israel Democrats in Congress. “Am Yisrael Chai!” he concluded, using a Hebrew rallying cry that means “The people of Israel live.” Joel B.

Kennedy Jr.’s relationship with Donald Trump is back in the spotlight — at a moment of upheaval in the presidential race and after a video of a phone call between the two was posted online and then deleted by Kennedy’s son. In the video, Trump can be heard talking with Kennedy about children’s vaccines and the gunshot wound he suffered at a Pennsylvania rally on Saturday. “It sounded like a giant — like the world’s largest mosquito. And it was, it was a bullet going round,” Trump said in the video. Appearing to commiserate with Kennedy about vaccines, Trump said, “I agree with you, man, something’s wrong with that whole system,” talking about dose size and vaccinating children. He added: “And then you see the baby all of a sudden starting to change radically. I’ve seen it too many times, and then you hear it doesn’t have an impact, right?” And Trump appeared to signal openness to doing something with his now-rival, though it’s unclear what. (In 2017, Kennedy told reporters that the then-president had extended an invitation to him to chair a committee on “vaccine safety and scientific integrity,” which the Trump camp later walked back in a statement.) “I would love you to do some — I think it would be so good for you and so big for you,” Trump said, according to the video, without mentioning anything specific. Neither Kennedy nor his campaign returned requests for comment. Trump’s campaign, when asked for comment, pointed to Kennedy’s social media post apologizing for his eldest son, Bobby Kennedy III, posting the video. The conversation comes at an unusual point in the 2024 campaign, with Kennedy talking to Trump at least twice in two days. The two candidates, who share some major donors and other overlapping support, met in person Monday in Milwaukee, site of the Republican National Convention. Kennedy is also seeking a meeting with Democratic leaders, according to his campaign, but he is not preparing to drop out, said his press secretary, Stefanie Spear. And it’s still unclear exactly what effect Kennedy will have on the 2024 election as he pushes for ballot access in every state and for a spot on the September debate stage. The independent candidate was set to hold a few events in Wisconsin this week but canceled because of “unforeseen circumstances,” according to a release. The campaign did not elaborate. Democrats say the Trump video confirms what they’ve been saying all along: that Kennedy’s presence in the race helps Trump and that it shows them now openly coordinating. “He’s a spoiler for Trump,” said Lis Smith, who is leading anti-third party efforts for the Democratic National Committee. The latest NBC News poll illustrated Kennedy’s complicated and ever-shifting role in the 2024 election. When offered Kennedy as a choice on the 2024 ballot, more respondents who initially chose Trump shifted his way. In terms of how people said they voted in 2020, about equal numbers of Biden and Trump supporters said they’d support Kennedy on a multicandidate ballot test. And while Kennedy’s favorability numbers have declined since the previous NBC News survey in April, with 23% of registered voters viewing him positively and 35% viewing him negatively, Kennedy has maintained a positive rating among self-identified Republicans: 33% positive, 22% negative. Kennedy and Trump have had up and down moments over the last few years. There was a meeting during Trump’s presidential transition, with nothing ever coming of it during the administration. Trump often egged on Kennedy while he was challenging President Joe Biden for the Democratic nomination — but the former president and his family turned critical when Kennedy became an independent general election rival. During an interview with Telemundo in March, Kennedy claimed that multiple people from the Trump campaign had reached out about him being considered a potential running mate. Chris LaCavita, a senior adviser for the Trump campaign, responded to Kennedy on social media: “your a leftie loonie that would never be approached to be on the ticket.” But Trump hasn’t always been hostile toward Kennedy this year. In June, Trump said he would have “no problem” with Kennedy joining that month’s CNN debate, but he ultimately did not qualify. Trump and Kennedy’s shared critical statements about vaccines have drawn them together over the years — and may be part of the reason there’s a degree of overlap in their support. The comments recorded in Kennedy’s video aren’t the first time Trump has expressed false beliefs about childhood vaccinations. In 2014, he tweeted that he was “against them in 1 massive dose,” falsely suggesting that childhood vaccines are administered all at once and that the recommended schedule — which is determined by an advisory committee made up of doctors, scientists and public health professionals — somehow causes autism in children. Nearly every doctor and scientist around the world agrees: There is no link between autism and vaccinations. The 1998 study that alleged the measles, mumps and rubella vaccines caused autism has been debunked and retracted, and the author, Andrew Wakefield, had his medical license revoked for ethical violations. Trump also met with Wakefield in 2016. Before he was a presidential candidate, Kennedy was an outspoken anti-vaccine activist as chairman and chief litigation counsel for the country’s largest anti-vaccine organization, Children’s Health Defense. Kennedy announced he would go on leave from the Children’s Health Defense to run for president in April 2023, and he has been more measured in his public anti-vaccine rhetoric since then — while at the same time staffing his campaign with anti-vaccine activists. In his own campaign, Trump has had to walk a delicate line between taking credit for Covid vaccines that saved lives and placating a conservative base that is more likely to distrust the vaccines. Trump attacked Kennedy’s anti-vaccine bonafides in a video in May. ”He’s not really an anti-vaxxer,” Trump said of Kennedy, “that’s only his political moment.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nRobert F.

Harriett Hageman (R-WY) said at a Moms for Liberty event outside the Republican National Convention. “We’re in a very strange moment in time in the sense that if you believe in freedom and liberty, they call us fascists. They put President Trump on the cover of a magazine equating him to Hitler. As I have said over and over again, there is only one Hitler.” Comparisons between Trump and Adolf Hitler have abounded throughout the presidential race, as have accusations that Trump represents an existential threat to Democracy in the United States. Hageman slammed the talking points as being dangerous, with the memory of Trump’s brush with death still fresh. “Every time that you compare someone to [Hitler], you are really denigrating what happened during World War II,” she added. “It is totally ahistorical. It’s a level of slander and libel that is beyond the pale.” Attention has also focused on President Joe Biden’s remarks to supporters that they should “put Trump in a bullseye” just days before the attack. Biden later said he regrets the remarks and has called to lower the temperature in politics going forward. But Rep. Byron Donalds (R-FL) said Hageman was “absolutely correct” in suggesting overheated language can lead to violence, saying his office has received repeated threats since he entered Congress. “The level of venom has reached a point where you have someone deciding to take lives into their own hand,” he said. “President Trump, by the grace of God, is with us today.” Biden argues that it is Trump who has used violent rhetoric on the campaign trail and said he only wanted Trump’s agenda to be put in the crosshairs.
