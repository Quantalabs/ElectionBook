Now, the No. 1 burning question is who will she choose as her running mate? A handful of names have been tossed around, many of them solid picks—but the choice may come down to the demographic she needs to court rather than which person she likes best. Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker may be who she needs to grab that never-Trump Republican vote.The Lincoln Project Demographic While former President Donald Trump maintains fevered support from the MAGA crowd, he continues to turn moderates and GOP-leaning independents away from the Republican Party—even those who backed him in the previous elections.An example of this came during an interview of an independent voter named Scott Simeone who said, \"I can't vote for Trump. He's a crook. He's too corrupt. I voted for him, and I didn't realize he's as corrupt as he is.\"You see it in the polls as well. A New York Times poll conducted in December showed that only 24 percent of unaffiliated voters would choose Trump in the presidential match-up. In Iowa, two in 10 voters don't want a Trump presidency and in New Hampshire, it is about one in three. A quarter of South Carolinians reject him as well.It is clearly a demographic that could help break that glass ceiling and put Harris in the Oval Office.J.B. Pritzker, who defeated Republican Bruce Rauner in 2018 to become the governor of Illinois, has already voiced his support for the Harris campaign saying, \"She represents our Party's best chance to defeat Donald Trump in November, and I will work my heart out to help her do that.\"The billionaire governor is an enticing pick. His substantial net worth allowed him to nearly self-fund his 2018 and 2022 campaigns, and he is known to give freely to other democrats when needed.Pritzker is one of the founders of the Pritzker Group, a venture capital firm as well as an heir to the Hyatt hotels. Should the hypothetical Harris-Pritzker ticket need a cash infusion, he is well-equipped to provide it because \"unlike Donald Trump, he is a real billionaire.\" (Not that Madame VP needs any help on the financial front—she's already killing it on the fundraising front.)Why Harris Might Choose HimPritzker has had a hand in quite a few progressive wins for the state of Illinois.—Legalized Marijuana—Recreational use was legalized in Illinois in 2020 making it the 11th state to do so. However, the bill Pritzker signed did more than just legalize usage, it also included \"a comprehensive legalization package\" that allowed for 700,000 low-level convictions to be expunged.—Raised Minimum Wage—Making good on a campaign promise, Pritzker signed a measure in 2019 to move the state's minimum wage from $8.25 to $15 by 2025.—Protected Abortion Rights—Illinois' Reproductive Health Act, which Pritzker signed in 2019, made reproductive health care a fundamental right in the state. \"When it comes to contraception, abortion, and reproductive care, this law puts the decision-making where it belongs: in the hands of women and their doctors,\" Pritzker said at the signing.Why Never-Trumpers Might Choose HimIt is abundantly clear that Pritzker has no love for Trump. When the former president was convicted in the hush money trial, Pritzker released a statement that said, \"Donald Trump is a racist, a homophobe, a grifter, and a threat to this country. He can now add one more title to his list - a felon.\"Dislike for Trump isn't enough to garner votes though.But, conservative-leaning independents might find Pritzker palatable because of his business ties. It is no secret that Republicans love a rich white dude.The economy is a big factor in everyone's decision this election, and Pritzker may have the economic chops to collect votes in November. His supporters in the state brag about how he \"stabilized Illinois' finances,\" balanced the budget, and \"helped get the state back on its feet.\" These accomplishments will sit very well with those worried about the financial state of the nation.Problems the Ticket Will FaceA VP Pritzker would likely fare well in his state which gets 19 electoral college votes in 2024, but it has swung blue in the last eight presidential elections—not much of a help to the Harris campaign. But, he is a better choice than California Governor Gavin Newsom, who would likely lose her her a swath of California electoral votes.Pritzker's toilet scandal is not something the Trump campaign is likely to leave alone, and then there are his comments caught on a FBI wiretap to contend with. Pritzker's scandals may be a hard sell for the Harris campaign. He is still a good VP choice in the long run.Dara Brewton is an actress and writer.The views expressed in this article are the writer's own.","summary":"Illinois Governor J.B.

The president made the announcement via a statement posted to his official X page. In it he said that his time in office was “the greatest honor of my life” and that despite his intention to continue with the campaign it was in the interest of the country for him to step down. The statement was put online just before 2pm eastern on Sunday. As of 8pm on Monday it had been viewed 396.3 million times, and “liked” almost one million times. The post had also garnered more than 351,000 reposts. A follow up post, in which Biden officially endorsed vice president Kamala Harris to take over the party nomination from him, had been viewed 109.1 million times as of 8pm on Monday. Harris’ own post, in which she thanked Biden for his “extraordinary leadership” and said she was “honored” to accept his endorsement, has just over 23 million views, with 638,000 “likes” and 86,000 reposts. The vice president currently has 20.1 million followers on X, while the president has 38.3 million. Shortly after Biden’s announcement, a spate of new social media accounts titled “Kamala HQ” emerged across all platforms. As of Monday night the “Kamala HQ” X account had a following of 932,500 followers. An introductory X message from the account, posted at 10.30pm on Sunday read: “Welcome to Kamala HQ.This is the official rapid response page of Vice President Harris’ presidential campaign.” As of Monday night the post had been viewed 11.1 million times, with 147,000 likes. Harris’ election campaign team has wasted no time courting young voters with the social media channels, quickly posting memes about Venn diagrams, “brat” summer and viral quotes from the vice president to appeal to Gen-Z’s sense of humor. The X account featured a post of a Venn diagram to illustrate the similarities between her and Biden’s campaigns — a nod to a viral running joke about Harris’s vocal love for the diagram style.","summary":"The president made the announcement via a statement posted to his official X page on Sunday afternoon","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/biden-campaign-drop-out-x-post-b2584113.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/07/21/19/GettyImages-2158994243.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/02VMuRz5-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-23 00:34:58","author":"Mike Bedigan","authors":["Mike Bedigan"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.124},{"id":252382596,"title":"Harris Campaign’s First Full Day: Record-Breaking Fundraising, Trump Attacks And Veepstakes Kick Off","text":"Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Topline Vice President Kamala Harris kicked off her presidential run with her campaign raising a record-setting $81 million in its first 24 hours, while she ramped up attacks on former President Donald Trump with an address to staffers Monday that criticized Trump and commended President Joe Biden, who dropped out of the race and endorsed Kamala on Sunday.

The fundraising will add on to the Biden campaign’s funds, which were turned over to Harris on Sunday and totaled $96 million at the end of June. Harris introduced herself to Biden’s campaign staff—now her campaign staff—in Wilmington, Delaware on Monday afternoon, giving a speech in which she leaned on her career as a prosecutor to blast Trump: “Predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain,” she said, before adding, “So hear me when I say I know Donald Trump's type.\" Harris told staffers another Trump presidency would “put Social Security and Medicare” on the chopping block” and that the former president wants “to take our country backward.” Biden called into the staff meeting and was praised by Harris, who lauded his presidency and was told by the president, “You’re the best, kid.” Get Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We’re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day’s headlines.

This remains unclear, with less than a month to go before the start of the Democratic National Convention, though Harris has tapped Obama administration Attorney General Eric Holder to lead the process of vetting her potential running mates. Figures like Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly have emerged as names commonly floated as possible top contenders—all of whom have already endorsed Harris. Beshear largely demurred when asked by MSNBC on Monday about potentially joining the ticket, but called the chatter “flattering,” while Cooper said in a separate MSNBC appearance, “I appreciate people talking about me.” Shapiro at a press conference said Harris has an “important decision” ahead of her. When Could Harris Secure The Democratic Nomination? Harris swiftly won the support of many Democratic delegates after Biden ended his campaign, and by Monday evening was on the cusp of crossing the threshold of the 1,976 delegates needed to clinch the Democratic nomination, according to an Associated Press tracker, which reported she had 1,661 committed delegates shortly after 8 p.m. EDT. Democrats had been planning to choose their nominee via a roll call vote, potentially as early as the first week of August, though the exact process remains up in the air—the Democratic National Convention’s Rules Committee plans to meet Wednesday to finalize the party’s process. The convention is scheduled for Aug. 19-22 in Chicago. Crucial Quote Biden, who is isolating after contracting COVID-19 last week, addressed staffers over the phone about his decision to drop out. “I know yesterday's news was surprising, and it was hard for you to hear. But it was the right thing to do.” Key Background Harris’ hot fundraising start is just one part of her efforts to lessen the polling gaps between her and Trump, as the former president commanded a six-point lead on her in a Forbes/HarrisX poll conducted July 19-21. Biden swiftly endorsed Harris after he announced his withdrawal from the race Sunday and said he believed it was in the best interest of the Democratic Party and country to “step down.” Biden was facing calls from dozens of Democrats in Congress to step down following a disastrous debate performance last month that put a spotlight on his age and mental acuity, which had been increasingly scrutinized as the 81-year-old president worked further into his term. Biden says he intends to remain president until his term ends in January.

Though there was immense pressure on the 81-year-old Biden to step down after his disastrous performance in the televised debate with former President Donald Trump in June, the President had stood firm and said only “Lord Almighty” himself could persuade him to drop out of the race. Biden’s debate fiasco was followed by more flubs at the NATO summit where he mixed up the names of his vice president Kamala Harris and his Republican rival and also addressed Ukraine’s President Zelensky as President Putin. At the same time he refused to undergo cognitive tests to assess his suitability for running for office. The last straw was the assassination attempt on Trump at a Pennsylvania rally that virtually sealed the deal for the former US President. As top donors pulled out of the Biden campaign and senior Democrats urged him to withdraw, the US President, self-isolating after a bout of Covid, was pushed into a corner and forced to end his presidential bid. With Biden endorsing her as the Democratic nominee for the presidential race, Kamala Harris is best placed to succeed him on the ticket which will make her the first non-white female and first Indian American candidate for the US presidency. However, her nomination is not a done deal. The process of nominating Biden’s replacement will culminate in the Democratic Party convention in Chicago in August. While Harris leads the race, other contenders for the Democratic nomination are Illinois Governor J B Pritzker, heir to the Hyatt hotel fortune; Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitner, who has risen in prominence in the Democratic Party; California Governor Gavin Newsom, who has been pushing a progressive agenda; rising political star Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro; North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper; Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear; and Arizona Senator Mark Kelly. Whoever the nominee is, they will be at a distinct disadvantage because of the limited time at their disposal to raise funds for their campaign. The uncertainty in the Democratic camp offers a big advantage to Trump, who — apart from his hardcore supporters — hopes to lure floating voters too. His pet rants on immigration, the economy and US foreign policy have a captive audience. His Make America Great Again (MAGA) slogan has caught on with a large section of the electorate. However, Trump’s overconfidence may well lead to his downfall. Underestimating his Democratic rival, whoever that may be, could prove costly. The groundswell of support for the Democrats among the African American and Hispanic communities should not be overlooked. Whatever happens in November, the USA is in for interesting times as it gets ready to elect its 47th President.","summary":"","url":"https://www.freepressjournal.in/analysis/editorial-us-presidential-race-heats-up","image":"https://media.assettype.com/freepressjournal/2022-03/97eb1339-1881-4259-bb80-9d15df8cb8ca/biden_eur.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-23 00:30:00","author":"Fpj Editorial","authors":["Fpj Editorial"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.246},{"id":252382598,"title":"The Remarkable Story Of Boll & Branch - An Interview With Scott Tannen","text":"Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Scott Tannen, co-founder & CEO Boll & Branch There’s something romantic about America’s pastime and collecting baseball cards makes it even more enjoyable. Scott Tannen, founder and CEO of Boll & Branch, and I we were remeniscing about our favorite cards we collected in our youth. If you look closely, there are a trove of life lessons we can also glean from the sport — many of which remind me about the story of Boll & Branch which embody resilience, grit, and determination. Ken Griffey Jr. was arguably the face of the baseball in the 1990s and while The Kid belted over 600 homeruns in his illustrious career, he also struck out nearly 10,000 times. Someone without Griffey’s notoriety and perhaps who most fans have never heard of is a man who once struck out 3 times in an entire season. How is that even possible? “I never had trouble seeing the ball,” said Joe Sewell, who often claimed he could see the spiraling seams on a baseball. “That’s because I followed it in. Why, I could even see the ball leave my bat.” In 7,132 career at-bats, Sewell heard the umpire say “Strike three” just 114 times. That’s one strikeout every 17 games, or in just .014 percent of his total times at the plate during the 1920s and 30s.

Missy and Scott Tannen Boll & Branch “We launched with a simple product line. We had sheets in two colors and blankets in three colors, that’s it. We wanted to be really good at one thing in particular,” explained Scott. Before the brand exploded on Howard Stern, there were several pivotal moments that led Scott and Missy to disrupt this legacy category. As the couple was transitioning to a king size bed, Missy looked high and low for the right sheets. This problem led Scott on an internet search journey that yielded the same results and eventually Missy had to step in because of her eye for design. “If I did this by myself we would have had a great business model and ugly sheets,” Scott admitted. In hindsight, the first chapter of his life may have prepared him for this opportunity. Growing up his father emobdied the image of the classic corporate professional, donning a suit and carrying a briefcase each day. His mother transitioned from being a homemaker to becoming a real estate agent. “It was only until I began my entrepreneurial journey that I realized it wasn’t my dad who was the entrepreneur, it was my mom. She opened up her own office and became one of the most productive realtors in the state of New Jersey. Eventually, my father was working for her.” His wife, Missy, mirrored his mother’s path in many ways. Missy had been a third-grade teacher before they decided to start a business together. When they founded their company, Boll & Branch, Missy was at home with their children. Her transition from homemaker to businesswoman highlighted the immense talent and capability that often remains untapped. Scott cut his teeth in digital marketing at CPG brands like Nabisco and Wrigley. It’s also where he observed and engaged with people who shaped his leadership philosophy today — like the art of receiving feedback. “I was leading a gaming website which at the time was one of the top 100 most visited websites on the internet and I was the young superstar. While everyone was telling me how great I was, Mike Brandstaedter, who later went on to become the CEO of Topps, gave me some of the best feedback.” Scott shared stories about the guidance from Mike before and after high profile meetings. “Mike would challenge me and he would help me stay grounded. He would prepare for big meetings and after when everyone would tell how great I did — he would constructively point out things I could have improved.” As Scott leaned in, he also acknowledged that he made a lot of mistakes in his career. At his last video game company he realized that the commercial success covered up some of the gaps in the organization and he learned his lesson the hard way. “When the iPhone came out and I knew the gaming industry was about to change. I had to question if we were good enough as a company and if I was good enough as a leader to go head to head against Electronic Arts. In the end, I decided to sell the company because I didn’t think we could win.” Backing down from a challenge wasn’t natural to Scott. But in hindsight, his mom was diagnosed with a terminal illness shortly thereafter and he was able to spend more time with her in those coming months — which I think was a blessing in disguise. This inflection point made him question everything. The real moment Boll & Branch was born wasn’t when he was searchign the internet for linens. It was this moment when he decided making an impact in his next role was paramount. It took nearly two years to go to market from the inecption of Boll & Branch because Scott and Missy were untangling the legacy manufacturing practices of the linen industry. “I remember learning that the life expectancy of a conventional cotton farmer in India at the time was 36 — and I was around the same age at that time. I began to question, why? It’s not hard to see things if you want to find the answers.” Scott learned that these farmers who were living below the poverty line were buying seeds along with toxic chemicals to grow cotton out of desperation — not always understanding or thinking about the effects on themselves, their drinking water, or their community. “Some farmers without an education couldn’t even read the warning labels on these chemicals. So they’re strapping them to their backs and spraying them out in the fields, and ultimately onto themselves.” Just like that an entire community is exposed to toxic chemicals which can lead to higher rates of cancer and other illnesses. As Scott was knee-deep in research, he came across Chetna, an organic cotton coalition supporting Fairtrade cotton. “They were started by a Dutch NGO and they were doing their own seed harvesting and helping communities convert over to being organic. They were determined to help communities improve their lifestyles and the average life exptectancy.” Scott had heard enough — but he also read that there was no demand for the cotton so he sent a cold email with compelling proposition. “I told them while I didn’t know anything about bed sheets — I was going to make some and I was going to use their cotton.” From there, Scott and Missy detangled the rest of the supply chain. They co-invested with family owned operations and helped them verticalize their own supply chain to become sustainable and profitable. In turn, there were less markups from middle men which provided better margins for the company and better savings for the customer. The success of the company didn’t come without hard decisions that had to be made. Instead of raising venture capital and making decisions based on what investors wanted, they decided to self-fund the company in the beginning. “We wanted to build the right kind of company. Neither of us would say we’re the smartest people in the room — but nobody would outhustle us. We never questioned whether or not this would work.” The most pivotal decision, however, came at the expense of Howard Stern on Sirius XM as they had only dabbled in advertising at that point but were ready to make a splash. He took out the last $2 million in debt because that was the minimum investment required to advertise with his favorite radio host. “I strongly believed Howard can sell this stuff because people trust him. At the same time, it didn’t make any sense. We're a luxury brand in the organic space. So why Howard? We sent him and his wife sheets and they loved them.” The brand exploded after advertising on Stern and it was difficult to keep up with demand. With success comes great sacrifice. In the early days the 24/7, 800 number actually rang Scott’s cell phone. But one of the greatest lessons he learned from his father was being present. Scott and Missy figured out a way to integrate their children into the business and they took them on trips to visit manufacturers overseas. The best leaders lead by example. “I love the concept of leaving loudly. I don’t miss my child’s games. I expect for my employees to do the same and they don't have to ask permission. If your kid is in the school play, you go and everybody else can pick up around you. Just be honest about what you've got and don't make the sacrifices that you'll regret and that will make you feel sad.” Life, like baseball, isn’t always about hitting homeruns. We strikeout, we get on base, and we learn from every situation with the goal of getting better. Hall of Famer Joe Sewell was often was solicited about how he kept his eye on the ball. “There’s no excuse for a major league player striking out 100 times a season,” Sewell said in 1960. “Unless, of course, he’s blind.” Follow me on Twitter.

They think she is a joke. ‘Cackling Kamala’, as Trump calls her, is the star of a thousand internet memes in which she looks awkward, talks oddly, not making sense — a bit like her predecessor. Caught on camera discussing the Vice President earlier this month, Trump was as brutal as you would expect: ‘She’s so bad,’ he said, ‘she’s pathetic.’ Trump will destroy her, the Grand Old Party (GOP) believes. And they know that if the Democrats seriously thought she could be a success, the party would have already endorsed her. But what if the Republicans are all wrong? What if Trump is making a grave error in underestimating Kamala’s strengths and assuming he’s on track to win in November? Indeed, there are plenty of Democrats who quietly hope — and maybe half believe — that Kamala has the power to reinvent herself. To recycle a slightly cumbersome phrase she has used on numerous occasions, Kamala is now ‘unburdened by what has been’. She is free from working for Joe — and she might yet bring down Donald Trump. Some suggest that Kamala’s fightback started well before Biden quit the race. Look at the money she raised in the first 24 hours. Her campaign team is claiming it was a cool $230 million. It was the biggest fundraising day of the 2024 election cycle — and probably a record amount for any candidate on day one. Money matters: if you are to grab the attention of the vast majority of Americans who couldn’t care less about politics, you must pay. She will have the cash. Kamala’s supporters are now hoping she can formulate a message that resonates with a nation that in many ways was equally unenthused with both Trump and Biden. She can tap into a hunger for a divisive and volatile chapter to be closed in American life. Kamala is not yet 60. In comparison to 81-year-old Biden and 78-year-old Trump, she’s practically a spring chicken. She is also — for all her gaffes and ‘word salads’ — a very successful woman. As Attorney General of California, she was a bold and tough prosecutor, unafraid to put people in jail. Donald Trump, as she will endlessly remind people, is a convicted felon. During her brief time in the Senate she made waves: famously asking one of Donald Trump’s candidates for the Supreme Court, now Justice Brett Kavanaugh, whether there were ‘any laws that give government the right to make decisions about the male body’ — a reference, of course, to abortion rights. The exchange went viral on social media. She has been an effective and constant campaigner for women’s rights and there is no doubt that many Americans feel very strongly about the issue. Many Democrats blame Donald Trump for appointing the Supreme Court Justices who repealed the Roe v Wade ruling in June 2022, ending the constitutional right to abortion. Recent history has shown that when abortion is on the ballot — as it has been in some state elections recently — the Democrats do well. It is, in other words, an issue that unites Democrats and divides Republicans. Kamala can energise the issue and fiercely take on those in Trump’s party who want to ban abortions completely. Her strong record on the subject will surely give her a confidence that she did not have in the past. There is something weird that happens when power gets close: you become a ‘serious person’ almost by default — and this could happen to her. Crucial to Kamala’s prospects could be her choice of running mate. Normally the VP doesn’t matter too much, but in such extraordinary circumstances, it might. A steady governor of a swing state that the Democrats need to win might help Harris to convince Americans that she means business. But there remains one thing in the way of her future success as a politician. She needs to take charge now. To strut her stuff on the world stage so that she can meet Trump as an equal. That means Joe Biden standing down, not just from the campaign, but from the presidency itself. Stubborn Joe, of course, is determined to stay in the Oval Office as long as he can. But there is a precedent for this that, eerily, might be relevant.

On Monday, Florida’s Democrats signaled their support. “The state of this race has changed,” said Florida Democratic Party Chair Nikki Fried. “Our mission has not — beat Donald Trump — and Vice President Kamala Harris is the woman for the job.” The Florida Democrats said 236 of the state’s 254 delegates to the DNC would back Harris’ bid to take over President Joe Biden’s campaign, one day after he announced he would not seek reelection. [RESULTS 2024: Want to vote in Florida? Here’s how to register and make sure you are eligible] Democrats also announced that all eight Democratic members of the state’s Congressional delegation are also now pledging to support Harris as the new nominee. It’s a big headstart for Harris, as Florida has one of the largest DNC delegations. While Biden endorsed Harris as his replacement, the Democratic National Committee says it will have an “open, transparent, fair and orderly” plan for the nomination process that will allow the nearly 4,700 delegates to the convention to decide who to nominate. Samuel Vilchez Santiago, who chairs the Orange County Democrats Executive Committee, says nearly all of Orange County’s DNC delegates support Harris, and on Monday night he expects the county’s Dems will vote to endorse Harris as well. “President Biden made it clear yesterday, when he chose Vice President Harris for vice president four years ago, he thought she will be the standard bearer for the Democratic Party,” Santiago said. “And quite honestly, the 14 million people voted for President Biden in the primaries also voted understanding that Vice President Harris would be our vice president, and so she comes with a lot of legitimacy within our Democratic base.” So far, no other Democrats have publicly entertained the notion of challenging Harris for the nomination. Many of the Democratic leaders mentioned previously as a possible replacement for Biden have already endorsed Harris, including California Gov. Gavin Newsome, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. All of them have since been named contenders to be Harris’ running mate. Santiago also mentioned Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, or North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper as good options. “We’re looking to balance our ticket so that Americans can see that the Democratic Party is in line with the American voter and that we can take the election and create a clear contrast with the extremist Republican ticket of Donald Trump and JD Vance,” Santiago said. Santiago also thinks a Harris nomination will change the election completely, even in Florida, which has been written off by many politicos as a “Red State” since the Democrats’ disastrous showing in the 2022 elections. Harris has already made several visits to the state to decry new abortion restrictions put in place by the Florida Legislature, and she will likely make many more trips if she gets the nomination. In the meantime, Santiago says local Democrats are going to continue doing what they’ve been doing since January — talking to voters about all of their candidates. So far, Santiago says the Orange County Dems have knocked on over 16,000 doors this year. “It is on us to make the case, and that’s exactly what we’re doing,” Santiago said. “We have phone banks set up every week. We have a door for canvassing events this Saturday, we have a canvassing event on Sunday. We’re taking over street corners on Friday, and so we’re energized, and we’re going to make the case to the people across Central Florida and to the people of the United States.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nORLANDO, Fla. – Vice President Kamala Harris has about a month to&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: &#8220;The ideal candidate: Florida Democratic representatives supporting Vice President Harris at the convention&#8221; first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/the-ideal-candidate-florida-democratic-representatives-supporting-vice-president-harris-at-the-convention/","image":"https://www.clickorlando.com/resizer/mx9fSRVOmIOUVmhXK4nt4-m6Nlw=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gmg/XODELAO3JRDOZMH4X2IUEFGYYA.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-23 00:22:39","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.09},{"id":252382166,"title":"Kyodo News Digest: July 23, 2024","text":"The following is the latest list of selected news summaries by Kyodo News. ---------- TOKYO - Bullet trains connecting Tokyo and Osaka resumed full service on Tuesday, after an accident involving railway maintenance vehicles caused an all-day suspension on part of the Tokaido Shinkansen Line a day earlier. JR Central said it planned to run four extra trains on the line before 7 a.m., following the conclusion of post-accident work late Monday. ---------- TOKYO - U.S. Forces Japan said Monday it will create a \"new forum for cooperation\" with Okinawa's government and local residents, amid criticism over recent revelations of cases of alleged sexual assault involving U.S. military members in the southern island prefecture. The forum, to be launched in coordination with Japan's central government, will \"serve as a venue for the constructive exchange of ideas in the pursuit of shared goals,\" U.S. Forces Japan Commander Lt. Gen. Ricky Rupp said in a press release. ---------- Founder of Sea Shepherd anti-whaling group arrested in Greenland TOKYO - The founder of Sea Shepherd, an anti-whaling marine conservation group, has been arrested in Greenland based on an international arrest warrant requested by Japan, his foundation said Monday. Paul Watson was apprehended on Sunday as he docked in Nuuk in Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark, to refuel as he journeyed with other crew to intercept Japan's Kangei Maru ship in the North Pacific, according to the Captain Paul Watson Foundation. ---------- Harris on course to replace Biden in U.S. presidential race WASHINGTON - U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris on Monday made tangible progress toward securing the necessary support to become the Democratic Party's standard-bearer in the race for the White House. A day after President Joe Biden abandoned his reelection bid, backing his vice president to become his successor, Harris picked up an endorsement from former House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, one of the most influential Democratic leaders. ---------- GENEVA - A species of ants is capable of treating the leg wounds of nestmates, including through biting off the injured appendage to prevent fatal infection and enable more in the colony to survive, a team of scientists from European and Japanese universities has found. The discovery of such behaviors among Florida carpenter ants was made public in the U.S. science journal Current Biology earlier this month. ---------- PARIS - Parent athletes have access for the first time to an Olympic village nursery, which does not provide childcare but offers a space for Olympians and Paralympians to spend quality time with their children. The nursery was set up in the athletes' village in Saint-Denis, north of Paris, after France's Clarisse Agbegnenou, the reigning Olympic judo champion in the women's 63-kilogram division, made a personal appeal to French President Emmanuel Macron earlier this year about bringing her daughter to the games. ---------- Japan, U.S. to hold 1st ministerial \"extended deterrence\" talks TOKYO - Japan and the United States will hold their first-ever ministerial talks regarding \"extended deterrence\" on Sunday in Tokyo, according to the Japanese government, in their latest efforts to better address intensifying security challenges posed by China and North Korea.

The first message labeled as from the “Harris for President” campaign hit inboxes early Monday, arriving shortly after midnight and containing a lengthy list of Democratic lawmakers that are publicly backing the Vice President’s nomination to the top of the party ticket following the Sunday afternoon announcement by President Joe Biden that he will not seek a second term. The message, delivered from the “joebiden.com” web domain used by the now-defunct Biden-Harris 2024 campaign, declared that “hundreds of elected officials from across the political spectrum followed President Biden’s lead and announced their full-throated support for Vice President Harris as the Democratic nominee for president to defeat Donald Trump in November.” “As Vice President Harris said, she ‘will do everything in [her] power to unite the Democratic Party—and unite our nation—to defeat Donald Trump and his extreme Project 2025 agenda,’” the Harris campaign wrote. Later, the campaign shared a long list of liberal leaning organizations which had also jumped on board, including the American Federation of Teachers, EMILY’s List, the SEIU, and the United Farm Workers. “Vice President Harris will have the organizing force of the entire backbone of the Democratic Party behind her as she campaigns to defeat Trump,” her campaign declared. Republicans, the newly-minted Harris campaign claims, are terrified of a Harris vs. Trump general election match-up. Harris, California’s former Attorney General, is used to dealing with felons like the former President, Harris for President Spokesperson Ammar Moussa said in a statement. “Vice President Kamala Harris has held criminals accountable her entire career – and Donald Trump will be no different. Vice President Harris has dedicated her career to making life better for working people – while Trump only cares about himself. That’s the contrast the American people will see over the next 106 days,” Moussa said. Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey, who stopped short of endorsing Harris on Sunday, joined the chorus of voices coming out in full force behind the Vice President in a statement shared by her campaign the very next day. “The future of our country as we know it is on the line. That’s why I am thrilled to support Kamala Harris as she works to earn the Democratic nomination and beat Donald Trump,” Healey said. Healey’s endorsement came on top of declarations of support from Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, Michigan’s Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, all of whom were rumored to possess presidential aspirations of their own. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, still a powerhouse in the party and part of the push for Biden to step aside, also endorsed Harris. Trump, meanwhile, was “watching the Fake News” on Monday and apparently seeing coverage which led him to declare Harris is “dumb as a rock” and “a totally failed and insignificant Vice President” that the Democratic Party is attempting to make “into a future ‘great’ President.” “No, it just doesn’t work that way,” he wrote on his Truth Social Media platform.","summary":"“Vice President Kamala Harris has held criminals accountable her entire career – and Donald Trump will be no different,” a Harris spokesperson said.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2024/07/22/vp-wastes-no-time-swings-at-trump-through-new-harris-for-president-campaign/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AP24204589420813.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-23 00:18:28","author":"Matthew Medsger","authors":["Matthew Medsger"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.202},{"id":252382240,"title":"New poll finds overwhelming support for Kamala Harris among Democratic voters","text":"Almost 80 percent of Democratic voters are in favor of Kamala Harris taking over the party’s nomination from Joe Biden, a new poll has shown, following the president’s shock decision to bow out of the 2024 race for the White House. A survey conducted by YouGov on behalf of CBS News showed that just 21 percent were in favor of nominating someone else over the vice president. The announcement of Biden’s departure from the campaign trail seems to have invigorated Democratic voters, with 45 percent saying that the party’s chances against Donald Trump in November were now “better.” Some 10 percent said that the chances of a Democrat win were worse, 17 percent said they were unchanged and 28 percent said it “depends on who the nominee is.” However despite this 79 percent of those surveyed backed Harris as the candidate, according to the poll. Despite the tumult of his final weeks in office, which prompted senior figures within the Democratic party to call for him to drop out, Biden’s legacy among the public remained largely favorable, according to CBS. Some 43 percent said they would look back at the legacy as “excellent”, while 39 percent said it was “good”. 15 percent said that Biden’s time in office had been fair and only 3 percent considered the president’s legacy as “poor.” This CBS News/YouGov survey was based on a national sample of 1,071 registered voters who identify as Democrats, who were interviewed July 21-22, 2024. All respondents participated in earlier national surveys of registered voters fielded July 11-13 and July 16-18, 2024, according to CBS. The numbers echoed remarks made by senior party members including Bill and Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and Nancy Pelosi and Barack Obama. In a statement issued on Monday, Pelosi said America had been blessed by the wisdom and leadership of President Joe Biden,” as she offered her official backing to Harris. The support from the Democrat higher-ups echoes that of the public, demonstrated by the funds raised by the newly rebranded Harris 2024 campaign – $84 million. The surge in new donations augments the $264 million war chest raised over the last quarter when Biden was still at the helm. According to the newly rebranded campaign, the $84 million sum “reflects money raised across the campaign, Democratic National Committee, and joint fundraising committees,” and includes 888,000 grassroots donors, a full 60 percent of whom gave for the first time this cycle. The campaign also announced a new crop of 43,000 recurring donors who signed up after Biden passed the torch to Harris, as well as $1.6m raised by a Zoom call hosted by the group Win with Black Women. Kevin Munoz, a spokesperson for the Harris campaign, said the “historic outpouring” of support for Harris “represents exactly the kind of grassroots energy and enthusiasm that wins elections.”","summary":"A survey conducted by YouGov on behalf of CBS News, showed that just 21 percent were in favor of nominating someone else over the vice president","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/kamala-harris-democrats-voter-support-poll-b2584111.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/07/22/23/2162454611.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/HIGYYHWI-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-23 00:14:59","author":"Mike Bedigan","authors":["Mike Bedigan"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.148},{"id":252382156,"title":"Charly Boy Threatens to Divorce Wife of 47 Years if Kamala Harris Doesn’t Win US Election","text":"Charly Boy, a veteran music artist, has promised to divorce his wife of 47 years if Kamala Harris, the United States Vice President, fails to win the 2024 presidential election.

While I have said from the beginning that if it’s not the president, it’s the vice president, I think it’s important to say that this was a serious mistake. I just hope it’s not a fatal one. It’s a serious mistake because the likelihood of Donald Trump winning this election has shot up by orders of magnitude. Yes, I know what Biden’s critics said. They said he was already on track to losing. But they didn’t really know that, nor did anyone when it comes to knowing the future. What we do know is history. An incumbent, even a very old incumbent who had a disaster debate, has advantages over his challenger, even a very old one who used to be the president. Biden, moreover, has an amazing record. Plus, the fundamentals are sound. No incumbent has lost with a national economy as sizzling as ours. Moreover, Biden’s critics didn’t have more than vibes to make their case. To be sure, they had polls, but there are many polls. You can find one to prove anything, including why Biden should have stayed. Up to the moment he dropped out, 538’s forecast said he had an even chance of winning – an even chance, despite weeks of merciless scrutiny. If there was internal campaign polling that showed damage hitherto unknown, we never saw it. The best we got, in terms of reasons why the president should drop out, came from a few dozen Democrats who said, more or less, trust us. That might have been convincing if it weren’t for the suspicion that they were covering their own asses. When you look back at this episode, please remember it wasn’t the Washington press and pundit corps that pushed him out. It was his own party. Even otherwise superlative leaders like former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi went soft. They could have done what the Republicans do for their nominee – gotten behind him no matter what. Trump is a fraud, an insurrectionist, rapist and criminal, but I guess Joe Biden looking old for 90 minutes was beyond the pale. There’s now a huge, urgent push to get on the Harris train. But let’s not forget how little it took – vibes! – for some of these Democrats to abandon Biden. Can these same Democrats be trusted to stick with the vice president? This is important to ask, because the vice president, as they say, is about to go through some things. If you thought being geriatric was a liability for Biden, just wait until Donald Trump, the Republicans and the rightwing media apparatus take aim at the country’s first biracial female Democratic Party nominee (presuming that she is formally nominated next month). Indeed, she has polled well, but that’s almost certainly because Democratic voters were themselves searching for someone they believed could be an alternative to Biden. Now that her candidacy is no longer theoretical, we’re going to see how firm that support is – or if it can be weakened by appeals to bigotry. For her to win, it’s going to take every single elected Democrat to stand up for her, loud and proud. Will they? I hope so, but why should I presume it? I also think there’s no small amount of naivete going into the liberal and Democratic reaction to Biden dropping out. Some of us appear to believe all the media energy that went into scrutinizing Biden for each and every sign of enfeeblement will now go into scrutinizing the former president. After all, he’s 78 years old, habitually incoherent and there are lingering questions about his mental health after his attempted assassination. Some Democratic operatives have even started saying that, with Biden gone, Trump is now the oldest candidate ever. All that makes sense, but all that presumes something – that the media energy that went into scrutinizing Biden was fair. It wasn’t. If it had been fair, there would have been equal time given to Trump’s performance during the disaster debate. That didn’t happen. The press and pundit corps barely remembered he was there. Neither did the elected Democrats who abandoned the president. Trump was a firehose of lies. He practically said the election is legitimate only if he wins. His statements were bowls of word salad. But they only had eyes for Biden. Why would we think the same standard applies to Trump? I expect that, by the end of the week, it’s going to be clearer to liberals and Democrats that whatever problems we thought we had under Biden are going to be matched evenly, at the very least, by a new set of problems under Harris. And that set of problems will become quite familiar, as they were the same set of problems the party faced under Hillary Clinton – precisely, getting swing voters in states like Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania to vote for a woman, this time a biracial woman. Biden had a path through those states, even amid the crisis. Does Harris? I hope so, because if she loses one, she’s done.","summary":"Now that Joe Biden has decided to drop out of the running, there is a huge, urgent push among liberals and Democrats to get on board the Kamala Harris train.

That plan came to fruition on Sunday, when the 81-year-old president dramatically announced the end of his campaign before endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris. However, a source close to Biden’s family is saying that the party put together a ‘palace coup’ over the course of recent weeks, with the president fighting it until he was threatened with being forced out. The insider says that the disastrous debate against Donald Trump on June 27 – the earliest presidential debate in history – was part of the strategy, despite being publicly requested by Biden on social media. ‘That debate was a set-up to convince Democrats that he couldn’t run for president,’ the source told the New York Post. Biden was often seen on split screen with his mouth agape and a blank stare during the showdown against Trump last month, immediately sending Democrats into a freak out. Though publicly, most of the faces of the left stayed behind Biden, in the shadows, party powerbrokers were threatening to invoke the 25th amendment. Section 4 of the amendment allows for removal of a president who is deemed incapacitated by any kind of illness, injury, or mental impairment. One of the few trusted by Biden who believed he was being pushed out: troubled son Hunter, who became a gatekeeper for his father after the debate. ‘Hunter felt he was being set up and he was very concerned about his father. These people, these officials were not on Joe’s side,’ the source claimed. They also said that it might not be a straight shot to the nomination for Harris, despite Biden’s endorsement. The source claimed that Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona may be a popular pick of delegates, though the former astronaut has already endorsed Harris. Once Biden was finally, officially convinced to get out, everything moved at the speed of light. He was isolating with COVID at his $3.4 million holiday home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, when his shrinking inner circle handed him polling data showing he could no longer beat Donald Trump. That was when they composed a letter saying it was time for him to step aside for the good of the future of the Democratic party. Donors had pulled millions of dollars in funds, the list of Democrats telling him to drop out was growing by the day, and polls suggested that his chances of beating Donald Trump were dwindling after his disastrous debate performance. Biden had previously insisted that he would only step aside if he was shown polling that proved Kamala Harris would fare better than him against Trump, or if he developed a ‘medical condition’. In the end, it was the first of those developments that sealed his fate. Biden went to bed on Saturday night at the beach house, knowing he would announce his bombshell the next day. At 1:45 pm on Sunday he began calling his senior staff at the White House and the campaign. By that time he had already told Harris and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. At 1:46 pm, his campaign account posted a letter from the president announcing his decision even as he was still on the staff call. Most of his staff – both in the White House and at the campaign – were shocked. They learned the news online, getting the alert when the @JoeBiden account posted the president’s missive. It capped a chaotic 48 hours for the Biden family as they hunkered in behind their patriarch with a small, inner circle of longtime aides supporting them. Some were even reporting back to Jill Biden about those staffers deemed disloyal. Meanwhile, Biden had veered from angry at the pressure from his party to acceptance of the situation. And once his final decision was made on Saturday night, the rest moved quickly. Biden called Harris directly to tell her the news. He also had one-on-one calls with White House chief of staff Jeff Zients and campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon, according to reports. He would also speak with his Cabinet, Members of Congress, governors, and supporters. But it all happened so fast many staff were hurt about the way they learned of the news, although they weren’t surprised by it. Harris then announced she was running for the Democratic presidential nomination.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe Democrat Party plot to get Joe Biden to drop out has&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: How Democrats tried to damage Biden&#8217;s campaign and the shocking ultimatum they gave him to quit the race first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/how-democrats-tried-to-damage-bidens-campaign-and-the-shocking-ultimatum-they-gave-him-to-quit-the-race/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/rewrite-this-title-REVEALED-The-cunning-ploy-devious-Democrats-used.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-23 00:07:20","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.229},{"id":252381748,"title":"Gov. Walz, other top Minnesota Democrats, line up to support Kamala Harris for president","text":"Minnesota Democrats are coalescing around Vice President Kamala Harris as their favored presidential nominee after President Joe Biden announced Sunday he would not seek reelection. Gov. Tim Walz and Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan, along with most Democratic members of Minnesota’s Congressional delegation and state party leadership, joined a swell of Democrats from across the U.S. backing Harris in the 24 hours following Biden’s announcement. “I’ve known Vice President Kamala Harris for years and I’ve seen her strengthen national security, protect reproductive rights, and pass historic legislation,” Walz said on X, formerly Twitter, Monday morning. “As a prosecutor running against a convicted felon, no one is better qualified to unite our party and take on Donald Trump.” Reps. Betty McCollum, Angie Craig and Ilhan Omar, and Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith all say they back Harris. Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party Chairman Ken Martin issued a statement in support of Harris on Sunday. “President Biden’s decision to withdraw from the presidential race was difficult, but it was the right decision at the right time,” McCollum said in a Sunday statement, just two days after she had called on the president to end his campaign. “Now Democrats must unite behind Vice President Kamala Harris as our party’s nominee for President and focus on the work ahead — defeating Trump and winning in November.” The 81-year-old Biden faced heavy pressure from high-profile Democrats to step down as concerns grew about his age following a poor performance in a June debate with Donald Trump, the Republican nominee and former president. By late last week, more than 30 Democratic members of Congress, including Minnesota’s Craig and McCollum, had called on Biden to suspend his campaign. Rep. Dean Phillips, who in March ended the only serious challenge to Biden’s place on the Democratic ticket, said he believed Harris was a qualified replacement. In a social media post Sunday, however, Phillips called for a “brief, transparent, competitive” process for choosing the party’s nominee. “Invite @KamalaHarris and the top three other vote getters to a series of four, televised town halls w/audiences of delegates before voting at the convention,” Phillips said on X. While the Democratic party is rallying around Harris, the party won’t officially select its nominee for president until next month’s national convention in Chicago. Other Democrats seen as legitimate contenders for the presidency, such as Govs. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Gavin Newsom of California, also have backed Harris, limiting the number of potential challengers with a higher national political profile. Veep Walz? Minnesota’s governor has been raising his own national profile as a surrogate for Biden on cable news programs, raising speculation about his ambitions beyond Minnesota. Walz, who chairs the Democratic Governors Association, attended a meeting at the White House earlier this month after Biden’s poor debate performance led to calls for the president to suspend his campaign and allow another Democrat to step forward. At the time, Walz said he believed Biden was “fit for office.” He never directly called for Biden to end his campaign. In a Monday interview with Minnesota Public Radio, Walz said he had spoken with Harris over the weekend and wouldn’t necessarily rule out being her running mate. McCollum, as she called for Biden on Friday to step aside and allow Harris to be the presidential nominee, suggested delegates to the Democratic National Convention back Walz as Harris’ running mate. Walz has built up his national profile with his leadership positions and media appearances, but political observers see more upside in Harris choosing a running mate from a swing state. Minnesota has favored the Democrat in the last 12 presidential elections, so a Harris-led ticket likely wouldn’t need a vice-presidential bump in the state to win the presidency.","summary":"Most Democratic members of Minnesota’s Congressional delegation, state party leadership, Gov.

In the 24 hours that followed the sudden and shocking announcement by President Joe Biden that he would suspend his campaign for the presidency to make way for his vice president, the Biden-Harris 2024 campaign had morphed into the Harris for President campaign and raised more than $81 million. According to Harris for President Spokesperson Kevin Munoz, donations from over 888,000 “grassroots donors” represent a shift in the Democratic party’s sentiments about the looming general election. “The historic outpouring of support for Vice President Harris represents exactly the kind of grassroots energy and enthusiasm that wins elections. Already, we are seeing a broad and diverse coalition come together to support our critical work of talking to the voters that will decide this election,” Munoz said in a statement. Most of the donors over the last day were making their first donation of the election, according to the campaign, and the $81 million figure is the “highest 24-hour raise of any candidate in history.” “This haul reflects money raised across the campaign, Democratic National Committee, and joint fundraising committees. This surge of support is also accompanied by numerous endorsements from federal and state elected officials as well as major Democratic and advocacy groups united in the effort to defeat Donald Trump this November,” the campaign wrote. A single Zoom call Sunday evening held by the group Win With Black Women — a meeting that was scheduled to be attended by 1,000 but was eventually joined by over 40,000 — raised more than $1.6 million, the campaign said. “There is a groundswell behind Kamala Harris, and Donald Trump is terrified because he knows his divisive, unpopular agenda can’t stand up to the Vice President’s record and vision for the American people,” Munoz said. That’s on top of the $95 million Harris has available from Biden’s war chest. In a letter sent to the Federal Elections Commission on Sunday, Harris for President Treasurer Keana Spencer proclaimed “that Vice President Harris is no longer a candidate in the 2024 election for Vice President.” “Vice President Harris is now a candidate for United States President in the 2024 election and will henceforth be conducting campaign activities only in pursuit of that office,” she wrote.","summary":"In the 24 hours that followed the sudden and shocking announcement by President Joe Biden that he would suspend his campaign for the presidency to make way for his Vice President’s ascendency, the Biden-Harris 2024 campaign had morphed into the Harris for President campaign and raised more than $81 million.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2024/07/22/kamala-harris-breaks-fundraising-record-pulls-in-81-million-in-a-single-day/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AP24204727881803.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-23 00:03:17","author":"Matthew Medsger","authors":["Matthew Medsger"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.064},{"id":252382356,"title":"US Secret Service and local police guard a checkpoint near the home of US President Joe Biden in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware","text":"US Secret Service and local police guard a checkpoint near the home of US President Joe Biden in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware | National News | guampdn.com Skip to main content You have permission to edit this image.

As President Joe Biden’s supporters rally around Harris to take his spot as the party nominee, Republicans are planning legal challenges. Biden announced his decision via social media Sunday afternoon, with one month until the Aug. 19-22 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona and Nevada are commonly labeled swing states. Collectively, there are 93 electoral college votes among them. No opposition to Harris emerging since Sunday’s social media announcement, Democratic delegates across the country swiftly moved to align support from a primary season where voters created enough pledged delegates for Biden. Patrick Gannon, the public information director for the North Carolina State Board of Elections, said the state’s laws will accommodate this change. “County boards of elections [in North Carolina] start sending absentee ballots to voters who have requested them on September 6, which I believe is the earliest in the country,” Gannon said in an email to The Center Square. He said that once the convention is held and the candidates are nominated, the ballots for North Carolina will be prepped. “In general, our agency requests that candidate names be given to us by mid-August so that there is sufficient time to prepare, proof, and print the ballots before the September 6 distribution deadline for absentee ballots. We should be able to accommodate the Democratic convention schedule, especially since we know there is a Democratic Party line that will go on every ballot, and we are simply waiting for names to insert before ballots are printed,” he said. North Carolina, which has 16 electoral votes, has been won by Republicans in all but two of the last 14 cycles. The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, has promised to sue if Biden drops out. While Marguerite Bowling, senior communications manager, told The Center Square in an email that “the team is holding off on any media requests for now,” more is likely coming from The Heritage Foundation’s Oversight Project. “We have been preparing for this moment for months. Many in the media tried discrediting us. Who is laughing now? No more ‘make it up as you go’ elections. Stay tuned…,” said the Oversight Project in a statement on social media following Biden’s announcement. Because Biden dropped out before becoming the official candidate of the Democratic Party, it does make it easier to replace him than if it had been after the Democratic National Convention. Pennsylvania is the swing state with the most electoral votes (19) and a new candidate will have no problem being placed on the ballot, according to Matt Heckel, press secretary for the Pennsylvania Department of State. “Under the Pennsylvania Election Code, the presidential and vice presidential nominees selected at the Democratic National Convention will appear on the general election ballot as the Democratic candidates for president and vice president,” Heckel said in an email to The Center Square. “Because the 2024 Democratic National Convention has not yet taken place, no nominees have been selected for the November ballot.” It is the same in Wisconsin, where the Democratic Party has until 5 p.m. on Tuesday, Sept. 3, to inform the Wisconsin Election Commission of its nominated candidates for president and vice president. Riley Vetterkind, public information officer for the Wisconsin Election Commission confirmed this information with The Center Square. In other battleground states: Michigan (15 electoral college votes): The presidential candidate must be submitted within one business day of the party’s state convention or national convention, whichever is later. Ballots will be prepared beginning Sept. 6. Presidential candidates are certified to appear on Michigan’s general election ballot as a result of the outcome of their respective party’s nominating conventions,” said a statement from Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson and Attorney General Dana Nessel. Arizona (11): The Democratic candidate can be changed up until 75 days before the election, which is Aug. 22. Georgia (11): Candidates must be submitted 60 days prior to Election Day, which is Sept. 6. Nevada (six): Normally, Democrats have until the fourth Friday in July, which is July 26, to nominate their candidates. But, due to an amendment passed in September 2023, major political parties now have until the first business day in September to submit names. This year, that’s Sept. 3.","summary":"Election laws in all seven battleground states will allow Democrats to place onto ballots the name of Vice President Kamala Harris, or another candidate if one materializes.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/07/22/us-news/swing-state-election-laws-allow-kamala-harris-to-get-placed-on-democratic-ballots/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/newspress-collage-v051kxkxa-1721691706717.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1721677334&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/CfNXg1yy-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-23 00:00:29","author":"The Center Square","authors":["The Center Square"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.187},{"id":252381530,"title":"Biden steps down: Letters to the Editor — July 23, 2024","text":"The Issue: President Biden’s announcement that he will not be accepting the Democratic nomination. The Democrats just exposed themselves again (“The end,” July 22). While pushing Biden to resign, none of them had a plan of what to do if he did. They are running around like a chicken with its head cut off. By the way, who is making the decisions? Rep. Nancy Pelosi, former President Barack Obama, etc.? Who is the “president” of the Democratic Party? Nobody seems to know what to do. Should it be Vice President Kamala Harris? Who else? If you plan to make a change, you must have a follow-up plan in place. Clearly, the Democrats don’t even now how to work together. Brian Keane Patchogue I can’t understand how all of these highly educated individuals were trying to convince the masses our president was sharp as a tack over the past year. Do they all think American citizens are so dumb they can’t see the truth? Biden didn’t deserve to be hoodwinked into believing he could still run the country. All those around him — staff, politicians, family, the media — should be ashamed of their behavior. Unlike former President Lyndon Johnson, who recognized reality, they all preached a false narrative, allowing our country and our president to be a laughingstock, just so they can maintain power. This is not democracy; it’s voodoo politics. D. Ricciardi Brooklyn ﻿It’s tempting to call Biden the ultimate “cheap fake.” However, he was a very “expensive fake” for cities dealing with illegal immigrants, taxpayers funding war, not peace, in Ukraine and those who are stuck paying for student debt because he shifted the burden to non-students. David Bryant Easton, Conn. Biden, upon his decision to exit the 2024 race said in his letter: “I believe it is in the best interest of the party and the country for me to stand down.” Notice he put party first, country second — as has always been the case with the Democratic Party. Thoughtful leadership would have had him state that it was in the best interest of the country alone. Then again, Biden has never been right on any issue at any time, and for the Dems, it’s about winning and power alone. Tom DeFazio Spring Lake Heights, NJ On the afternoon of June 27, Democrats were fully united in supporting Biden. By the end of the night, they were not. After much hand-wringing and teeth-gnashing, the president has stepped aside. Democrats now find themselves without a candidate and no playbook on how to get one. While this is totally their own doing, it does not erase the fact that they need to decide on a candidate prior to the convention. An open convention would be a disaster, and having it in Chicago is not a good omen. Peter Kelly Hazlet, NJ Biden’s bugout is the most egregious bait-and-switch to have occurred in our history. The only reason he quit is that the donor class refused to pony up for such a pathetic loser. The ship has deserted the sinking rat.

For starters, Harris is expected to focus heavily on protecting abortion access, an issue she has been fluent at using against Donald Trump and the Republican Party. “She will attack them repeatedly and mercilessly on reproductive rights,” said Drew Altman, the president and CEO of KFF, a nonpartisan research group. “I think it’s been a winning card for her so far, and I would expect to see her dial that up tremendously.” Andy Slavitt, a top health care official in the Barack Obama and joe Biden administrations who has informally advised Harris, said she has an advantage on abortion, an issue that resonates with voters. “It’s awkward for President Biden to talk about it,” Slavitt said. “But I think she knows how to talk about it in ways that people relate to.” As vice president, Harris's goal has been to advance and promote Biden’s agenda. But if she secures the Democratic presidential nomination — as she's currently favored to — Harris would be free to cast her own vision to remake the health care system. And her record and 2020 presidential campaign provide some clues about how she would govern. Her campaign didn't respond to a request for comment as the Harris campaign is in its early stages. But her record and 2020 presidential campaign provide some clues about how she would govern. “We can expect her to try to build on the Biden legacy of expanding coverage,” Sabrina Corlette, a health policy expert and professor at Georgetown University. “And she’s going to have to do something to bring down costs.” Corlette predicted Harris would look to protect the Affordable Care Act and extend the enhanced subsidies designed to lower costs, which are currently set to expire at the end of 2025. She’d also likely work with Congress to try and extend Medicaid coverage in the 10 states that haven’t expanded it under the Affordable Care Act. And she could carry on Biden’s attempts to expand Medicare to cover dental, vision and hearing benefits for seniors. It’s still early for even close allies to know how Harris will seek to balance embracing Biden’s approach with carving out her own. “I have no idea,” said Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., a powerful figure within the party, though he added that the Obama-Biden health care legacy would in good hands with her. “She’s a part of it,” Clyburn said. Beyond that, Harris showed more liberal instincts on health care in her 2020 campaign than Biden did, which could be a factor. “She may be more willing to take on some of the sacred cows in health care than the Biden administration was,” Corlette said. “She obviously signed onto Medicare for All. She also supported public option proposals in the Senate. You could see more backing of a government-supported plan option for people, which could have the power to bring down the costs of insurance.” Harris signed onto the Medicare For All Act of 2019, led by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., a few months into her presidential bid. The bill sought to expand Medicare to cover all Americans and effectively end private insurance. It divided the Democratic Party — progressives embraced it, but moderates, including Biden, feared it went too far by effectively eliminating private coverage. The issue tripped up Harris when she was quizzed on the bill's impact on the private insurance most Americans have. She later offered her own health care bill that leaned on Medicare Advantage to preserve a role for private coverage. At the time, the episode raised questions among Democratic elites and voters about where she stood ideologically. Harris ended her campaign later that year and by the time Biden chose her to be vice president, she embraced his proposals. “I don’t think she’s a disrupter. I don’t think she’s going to be pushing for some big, radical change,” Slavitt said. “People will talk about how she signed on to Bernie’s bill. A lot of people signed on to Bernie’s bill for a variety of reasons. Some, to state the ideal is universal coverage. … Some because they believe in it literally. ... I read her as more pragmatic.” Altman added that in this campaign, Democrats are highly unlikely to revive Medicare for All “because of their fear of Trump.” Republicans are combing through Harris’ past statements on health care and looking for material to use against her. A GOP strategist noted that in a June 2019 debate, Harris was among 10 Democratic candidates who raised their hand when asked if the U.S. should insure undocumented immigrants. Harris didn’t discuss it, but others on stage argued that it was humane and fiscally wise to ensure broad coverage so people are less reliant on expensive emergency care when they get sick. On the campaign trail, Altman expects that Harris will continue to promote existing initiatives from the Biden administration, particularly the ongoing rollout of the Inflation Reduction Act. Among the provisions is a $35 per month cap on the out-of-pocket cost of insulin for seniors on Medicare, which went into effect on Jan. 1, 2023. Starting next year, the law will also impose a $2,000 out-of-pocket spending cap on prescription drugs for people on Medicare. It also allows the federal government — for the first time — to negotiate prices for drugs that Medicare spends the most money on, a long sought-after goal by Democrats and some Republicans. The government is currently negotiating with drugmakers on the 10 costliest drugs under Medicare, which include popular heart medications and diabetes drugs. The new prices are expected to be published by September and go into effect in 2026. A KFF poll published in May found that more independent voters trusted Biden over Trump when it came to many areas of health care, including health care costs. Harris will be seeking to carry that years-long Democratic advantage. Altman said he expects Harris to lean into protecting Medicare and Medicaid, while highlighting GOP proposals that would partially privatize or cut those health care programs for elderly and lower-income Americans, respectively, a tactic Democrats have used against Republicans for years. Those GOP proposals include some recommendations in \"Project 2025,\" a sweeping collection of right-wing ideas to transform the U.S. government. Though it was written by former Trump officials in anticipation of a second term, Trump has said he knows “nothing” about it. “I also suspect she will be the first to bring Medicaid into the picture,” he said, “arguing that the various Republican groups from [Project] 2025 to the Republican Study Committee are proposing to eviscerate the Medicaid program by capping and cutting it.\"","summary":"A Kamala Harris presidency could have far-reaching consequences for the U.S. health care system, from abortion rights to insurance coverage to drug pricing.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/kamala-harris-presidency-mean-us-health-care-abortion-rcna163124","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-07/240722-Kamala-Harris-Healthcare-aa-601p-faff2c.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-22 23:54:57","author":"Sahil Kapur","authors":["Sahil Kapur"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.119},{"id":252381768,"title":"Kamala Harris running for president inspires women of color in politics and voters excited for historic possibility","text":"CHICAGO (WLS) — Women in office and women voters are enthusiastically supporting Vice President Kamala Harris as the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee after President Joe Biden ended his re-election campaign Sunday.

Harry Daniels, however, was already on top of doing what he does best — surprise-serenading celebrities. The influencer took to social media on Monday (July 22) to share a video in which he sees “Ms. VP” Harris in a hallway, and begins singing the opening lines of Beyoncé’s “Formation” to her. “Y’all haters corny with that Illuminati mess / Paparazzi, catch my fly, and my cocky fresh / I’m so reckless when I rock my Givenchy dress,” he belts to the Democratic politician, who watched in surprise. The song choice made sense, as Harris is an outspoken Beyoncé fan, having attended her Renaissance tour last summer and even walked out to the superstar’s “Freedom” during her campaign staff meeting earlier this morning. “Uh, hi,” Harris tells Daniels while giggling, before being escorted out of the room. “Who is that guy?” the vice president is heard hilariously asking her team before the clip cuts. It’s hardly Daniels’ first time singing to politicians, as he’s previously graced President Biden with a rendition of Lana Del Rey’s “National Anthem” and former President Barack Obama with Halsey’s “New Americana.” Since Biden’s endorsement of Harris, countless party members, public figures and voters alike provided an outpouring of support for the attorney-turned-politician’s last-minute campaign, which raised more than $50 million in fundraising less than a day after it launched. “On behalf of the American people, I thank Joe Biden for his extraordinary leadership as President of the United States and for his decades of service to our country,” Harris wrote in a public response to the news. “I am honored to have the President’s endorsement and my intention is to earn and win this nomination.” Watch Daniels serenade Harris below.","summary":"\"Uh, hi,\" the politician said to the 20-year-old TikTok star before bursting out in laughter.","url":"https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/harry-daniels-sings-beyonce-formation-kamala-harris-1235737151/","image":"https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Kamala-Harris-2022-billboard-1548.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-22 23:49:37","author":"Rania Aniftos","authors":["Rania Aniftos"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.585},{"id":252381502,"title":"JD Vance calls for 25th Amendment to be invoked after Biden exits presidential campaign","text":"During his second rally of the day, vice presidential nominee JD Vance once again called on Democrats to invoke the 25th Amendment following President Biden's announcement on Monday that he was exiting the presidential race. \"Can anybody just admit that if Joe Biden is not fit to run for president, he ain't fit to serve as President of the United States either?\" Vance asked the crowd. \"And if Kamala Harris is too blind or too corrupt to admit to the American people that Joe Biden should have never been in there, she's not fit to serve, either.

I don't know, I was looking forward to debating Kamala Harris actually,\" Vance said. \"I was promised a debate with Kamala Harris, and that's what I plan to get.\" JD VANCE RALLIES VOTERS IN HIS HOMETOWN HOURS AFTER BIDEN EXITS PRESIDENTIAL RACE Vance argued that making Harris the presidential nominee is dangerous as she is even worse than Biden. \"Now, history will remember Joe Biden as not just a quitter, which he is, but one of the worst presidents of the United States of America. But my friends, Kamala Harris is a million times worse, and everybody knows it,\" Vance explained. \"She signed up for every single one of Joe Biden's failures, and she lied about his mental capacity to serve as president. Our country has been saddled for three and a half years with a president who cannot do the job. And that is all because Kamala Harris and the rest of the Democrats lied about his ability to be our president. I think we ought to kick them all out come November and replace him with some people who care about this country,\" Vance said. Vance added more points about Harris and her failure to secure the border. JD VANCE CALLS ON DEMOCRATS TO INVOKE 25TH AMENDMENT: IF BIDEN 'CAN'T RUN...HE CAN'T SERVE' \"Harris is actually even more extreme than Biden, even though that's hard to believe. She wants to totally decriminalize illegal immigration. She supported abolishing ICE and wanted to defund the police. Even Joe Biden never went so far as to say he wanted to defund the police,\" Vance said. \"There is simply no way that you can sit here and say the policies of Joe Biden have worked, which is to say that we got to kick Kamala Harris out of the Oval Office. Don't give her a chance,\" Vance urged. Vance, once again, called what is happening to the Democratic Party a threat to democracy. VANCE HITS CAMPAIGN TRAIL AS HARRIS TEAM SCRAMBLES TO CONSOLIDATE DEM SUPPORT \"Democrats are the ones who want to throw out 14 million ballots and not elect Kamala Harris, but select Kamala Harris with a bunch of billionaires and Barack Obama and Nancy Pelosi making the decision instead of Democrat voters. It's disgraceful. And that's the threat to American democracy, that corruption and that broken process,\" Vance said. Vance offered the crowd an open invitation to the Republican Party where their vote would matter and be heard.

We believe in persuading voters, not lying to them for three and a half years and then doing a switcheroo,\" Vance said.","summary":"Trump&apos;s vice presidential nominee called on Democrats to invoke the 25th Amendment once again during his second rally of the day in Virginia.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/jd-vance-calls-25th-amendment-invoked-biden-exits-presidential-campaign","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/03/931/523/vance-biden.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-22 23:47:42","author":"Stepheny Price","authors":["Stepheny Price"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.501},{"id":252381366,"title":"Cash Reserves, Donations for RFK Jr. Campaign Drop in June: Filings","text":"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. continues to face declining cash reserves, according to new federal filings. On July 20, two committees associated with the Kennedy campaign filed monthly disclosure statements with the Federal Election Commission covering their June activities. Those documents showed the campaign and its allied super political action committee collectively held about $21.6 million entering July. However, the groups also hold about $3.9 million in debt. Mr. Kennedy’s principal campaign committee, Team Kennedy, brought in about $5.4 million but spent $6.3 million in June. The committee ended the month with about $5.6 million in cash. Moreover, the committee told the FEC it owes about $3.1 million in debts and obligations. American Values, a hybrid PAC boosting Mr. Kennedy, raised about $228,000 in June. During the same month, it disbursed about $3.5 million. However, it entered July with about $16 million in cash on hand, balanced by about $800,000 in debts. The PAC collected only five contributions in June. The largest, $100,000, came from Abby Rockefeller, a member of the wealthy Rockefeller family. According to its disclosure, Team Kennedy ended June owing about $3.1 million to the private security firm Gavin de Becker and Associates LP. The private security firm is run by Gavin de Becker, a key supporter of American Values 2024, the hybrid PAC supporting Mr. Kennedy’s run. According to federal records, Mr. de Becker has donated close to $14 million to American Values since April 2023. According to FEC records, American Values sent Mr. de Becker a $2 million refund on June 28 in its largest transaction of the month. Going forward, the Kennedy campaign should see a drop in its security spending. On July 15, Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas said Mr. Kennedy would receive U.S. Secret Service protection as a major presidential candidate. Mr. Kennedy, who’s said he’s already had attempts on his person since announcing his independent run, had long complained about a lack of Secret Service protection. His uncle, President John F. Kennedy, was assassinated in 1963, and his father, former U.S. Attorney General and New York Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, was assassinated in 1968 as he was making a bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. Campaign security, in general, became a much larger issue on July 13 after 20-year-old Thomas Crooks attempted to assassinate former President Donald Trump at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. The gunman took multiple shots at the leading Republican presidential candidate, wounding him and two rallygoers. Former fire chief Corey Comperatore was killed while protecting his wife and daughter. American Values owed most of its debts to the social media giant X Corp. It listed about $763,000 in debt to the company that operates the platform formerly known as Twitter. Mr. Kennedy did not receive an invitation to the June 27 debate between President Joe Biden and former President Trump. Instead, he hosted his own livestream event on X with former television news anchor and reporter John Stossel. Combined, American Values and Team Kennedy spent about $124,000 on advertising and other services on X in June. American Values also made about $763,000 in independent expenditures supporting Mr. Kennedy on the social media site. Team Kennedy spent about $300,000 on internet advertising with Meta Platforms Inc.’s social media site, Facebook, and about $55,000 on internet advertising with Google. Mr. Kennedy is presently on the ballot in 26 states, according to his campaign. The candidate submitted signatures to appear on the ballot in every state but Louisiana, which requires a fee but no signatures.","summary":"The independent presidential candidate reported owing millions to a private security firm at the end of June.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/cash-reserves-donations-for-rfk-jr-campaign-drop-in-june-filings-5691755","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/07/10/id5683729-RFK-JR-14_JF_06122024-LSedit-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-22 23:45:41","author":"Austin Alonzo","authors":["Austin Alonzo"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.229},{"id":252381760,"title":"Elon Musk’s response to Kamala Harris announcing her campaign","text":"‘I strongly disagree.

Voters have told ABC News that this election feels like it's more of a vote against Trump than for Biden. Harris told staffers it's more than \"us versus Trump.\" \"This campaign is not just about us versus Donald Trump,\" she said. \"Our campaign has always been about two different versions of what we see as the future of the country... one focused on the future, the other focused on the past. Donald Trump wants to take our country backward to a time before many of our fellow Americans had full freedoms and rights.\" Staffers were told Sunday night that they would keep their jobs, and on Monday, it was announced that former campaign co-chair Jennifer O'Malley Dillon would stay on to run the campaign.

Reverend Bernice King, daughter of civil-rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. and chief executive officer of The King Center, said that while she had been voting since she was 18, she had never endorsed a candidate publicly, until now. “I’m 100% in her corner, I’m going to be very strategic in the way that I move forward,” King said on the call. Win With Black Women, a political advocacy group that organized the call, later said it raised $1.5 million in three hours for Harris’ election campaign, joining a rush of other donations as Democrats raised more than $50 million online Sunday after President Joe Biden said he wouldn’t run for reelection. Biden’s decision to step aside and endorse Harris could pose a threat to the Trump campaign. Polls had shown Black voters, who overwhelmingly supported Biden during the 2020 election, had been moving away from the Democratic party following concerns about inflation, slow progress on civil-rights issues and the president’s support for Israel in the war in Gaza. Trump, meanwhile, had sought to make gains with Black voters. Others on the call included former Democratic National Committee chair Donna Brazile, Washington, DC mayor Muriel Bowser and Maryland’s First Lady Dawn Moore. Maryland governor Wes Moore later issued a statement supporting Harris’ candidacy. The huge attendance for the call meant that organizers had to ask Zoom Video Communications Inc. to extend the capacity limit for the meeting, which the video conferencing company was able to do for the customer. Representative Beatty, a Democrat representing Ohio in Congress, urged attendees to use their platforms to rally support for Harris in their communities. “We come with a strong message because we’re in the fight, we’re on this journey, we realize the magnitude of this moment,” she said.

The president had not been heard from since last Wednesday when he tested positive for COVID-19, forcing him to cancel an event. Now, on Monday, as Harris gathered her election team to outline their path to victory, Biden called in to wish her well and explain his decision to suspend his reelection bid. “Julie, if I didn’t have COVID, I’d be standing there with you,” Biden told his campaign manager who is now working for Harris, Julie Chavez Rodríguez. “I want to say hello to Kamala if she can hear me. I know she’s going to be speaking shortly. I want to say to the team: Embrace her. She’s the best.” “I know yesterday’s news was surprising and it’s hard for you to hear, but it was the right thing to do. … I think we made the right decision,” the president added. Biden’s words from the telephone are unlikely to cool speculation as to where he is, especially as a growing number of Republicans have said that if he doesn’t believe he can run for reelection, he shouldn’t remain in the White House. The president has asserted he will finish his term. Even as Biden passed the torch to Harris, he did so without a national address, instead writing a letter and circulating it on the internet. His allies have said his absence from the public eye has been because of his COVID-19 diagnosis. The president’s doctor said on Monday that Biden is still continuing his duties and that the public will be informed of any changes in his recovery process. Still, some GOP lawmakers, such as Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-CO), want to see “proof of life.” The question of whether Biden’s call was prerecorded was also considered.

While Kamala Harris is likely much less prone than Joe Biden to show cognitive issues by mixing up names and losing track of what she’s saying, she’s still got to find a way to make up ground against Donald Trump in the next 104 days. A HarrisX/Forbes poll released Monday (but conducted July 19 to 21, the day Biden left the campaign) has Trump in blowout territory, leading Harris 50% to 41% overall and 51% to 40% among likely voters. “Kamala Harris starts her 2024 battle behind Trump, who is enjoying a strong post-convention bump and leads her by almost [double] digits in our polling,” commented Dritan Nesho, HarrisX CEO and chief pollster. “If the polls don’t start to close and show better traction for her, Biden’s decision to step aside for Harris may be a case of ‘too similar, too late.’” That survey isn’t the only one with red flags for the blue team. An On Point Politics/SoCal Research Sunday survey shows Trump with majority support, leading Harris 51% to 43% in one of the first national polls conducted after Biden left the race. While the poll had a +2 Republican lean in sampling (with 38% of respondents being GOP versus 36% Democrat), other data should worry Democrats — including 24% of respondents saying they’re more likely to support Trump with Biden out, against just 18% less likely to do so. The Trump camp spotlighted this survey along with a slew of Trump-Harris trial heats in its favor ahead of Biden deciding not to run, saying in an email to press that “even if Democrat Party insiders and donors are able to successfully anoint disgraced border czar Kamala Harris as the new nominee — disenfranchising millions of Democrat primary voters in the process — it won’t save them.” But not all polling is bad for Harris. A Quinnipiac poll released Monday shows a too-close-to-call race, with Trump up 45% to 41% in a six-way run including minor candidates. To put that in perspective, Trump was up by 5 points against Biden in the same scenario. “The dramatic reset at the top of the Democratic ticket does little to move the race as Vice President Harris enters the fray with numbers similar to President Biden,” said Quinnipiac University polling analyst Tim Malloy. A Morning Consult survey released Monday shows a 47% to 45% lead for Trump, a more positive look for Dems than the 6-point lead Trump had over Biden, even though just 65% of Democrats support her to lead the ticket. That’s better than what a Sunday survey from YouGov showed. In that poll, 60% of Democrats say the Californian should be the party’s presidential nominee, with 21% of Democrats wanting someone else and 19% not sure what they want. These numbers have room for improvement, especially given that most Republican registrants have coalesced around Trump amid months of lawfare against him and his survival of an assassination attempt this month. If Harris can’t unify the party, she can’t win. And she hasn’t gotten it done yet despite help from most of the Dem establishment. Single-state polling is beginning to surface that includes at least some sampling from after Biden left the race, and it doesn’t show Harris delivering just yet. If the election were held today, she would lose at least two states Biden won in 2020. An Atlanta Journal-Constitution survey released shortly after Biden left the race showed Trump leading Harris, 50.5% to 45.9%. Trump’s lead over Harris was more than the 3.5% advantage he had over the current president in the same sample. And the poll suggests Harris is a turnoff among key demographics Democrats will rely on in the Peach State. Among nonblack minorities (Asians and Hispanics), Trump leads the veep by 12 points — as compared with a more modest 3.8% lead he had with the same demographics against Biden in the same sample. Harris also performs worse among women than Biden against Trump, carrying her own gender with a 7.4% margin, while Biden had a 9-point lead. Meanwhile, Republicans last won New Hampshire in 2000 — but polling conducted between July 19 and 21 suggests they have at least an even shot this year in the Granite State. The New Hampshire Journal poll released Sunday shows Trump ahead of Harris, albeit marginally — 40.2% to 39.3%, with an additional 20.5% favoring Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in the Live Free or Die State. Pollsters also posed the Trump/Biden question. While Trump still carried that trial heat, it was by just 0.3% (39.7% to 39.4%), with Kennedy up to 20.9%. Both Trump leads are well inside the +/- 3.99% margin of error. But the polling data include an important caveat that should hearten Republicans: “Political polls using online panels occasionally display a liberal/Democratic house effect in comparison to other polls, and this should be kept in mind when interpreting the results presented above.”","summary":"After a seismic shift atop the Democratic presidential ticket, the likely new nominee faces some of the same problems the current president does.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/07/22/us-news/kamala-harris-would-lose-at-least-two-states-biden-won-in-2020-if-election-were-held-today-polls/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/newspress-collage-q0uzx1nc1-1721691466391.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1721677231&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/CfNXg1yy-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-22 23:40:49","author":"A.g.

After President Joe Biden announced his decision to forfeit re-election, a tidal wave of memes about Vice President Kamala Harris — whom Biden backed as the Democratic presidential candidate — flooded the internet. On platforms like TikTok and X, the mood felt celebratory as many left-leaning accounts posted upbeat fan edits of Harris and made memes out of her more memorable lines from speeches. On Sunday, British pop artist Charli XCX appeared to back Harris, calling her a “brat,” a reference to her new album, which has become the Gen Z theme of the summer. Some political strategists say the memes are helping Harris generate a level of organic social media clout among Gen Z that Biden has struggled to cultivate, amplified by the spotlight of a possible presidential nomination. “She doesn’t take herself too seriously. She knows how to have fun, and she’s somebody that is willing to be a little bit less stuffy than a traditional presidential candidate would be, and I think that’s a good thing in this election cycle,” said Marianna Pecora, the communications director for the Gen Z-run political advocacy group Voters of Tomorrow. But Pecora said the viral moments aren’t just for laughs — they also indicate broader support for Harris, particularly among young people who have at times felt disenchanted by presidential candidates. “I don’t think that anyone is going to necessarily meme their way to the presidency,” said Pecora, 20, a student at George Washington University. “But I do think that being able to make this election something bright and fun and exciting and something that’s infiltrating people’s feeds and therefore their everyday lives is only a good thing.” Part of Harris’ frequent virality comes from her tendency to show off her seemingly authentic personality online. It’s why many of her vocal online supporters — who call themselves the KHive — have staunchly defended her since her first presidential run in 2020. The KHive, which is a play on Beyoncé’s BeyHive, has exhibited stan behavior in the way it circulates content and news about Harris. It has rallied around a plethora of humorous moments, from her love of Venn diagrams to her out-of-tune rendition of “Wheels on the Bus” to her propensity for busting out enthusiastic dance moves. After Biden’s debate with Trump in June, which sparked a panic about his capacity to run for re-election, the KHive gained renewed momentum online. Fans of Harris turned a speech last year in which she quoted her late mother, Shyamala Gopalan, talking about a “coconut tree” into a running meme. “My mother used to, she would give us a hard time sometimes and she would say to us, ‘I don’t know what’s wrong with you young people. You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?’” Harris said in the speech. “‘You exist in the context of all in which you live and what came before you.’” In the 24 hours since Biden’s announcement, Google searches for “coconut tree” spiked dramatically. The “coconut tree” army gained so much traction overnight that even elected representatives — such as Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker — leaned into it. Many X and TikTok users joked that the “coconut prophecy” had been fulfilled. So far, however, Harris herself hasn’t publicly acknowledged the meme. A spokesperson for the White House didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Monday. Harris’ slight eccentricity has sometimes made her an easy target for jokes online. Some conservative accounts have tried to mock her more viral moments. In December, the Republican National Committee made a 4-minute-long compilation of Harris using one of her more notable lines: “What can be, unburdened by what has been.” But some, like Annie Wu Henry, a digital and political strategist, said that just because some of the things Harris says are silly doesn’t mean they leave a bad impression or deter prospective voters. “Some of these phrases we’ve seen, like the coconut one, when it first got into the ether, people were like, ‘What is this quote?’” said Henry, who ran the viral TikTok campaign of Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., in 2022. “But as people were reading it, they were like, ‘No, this actually is a really insightful thing to say.’ And people are having fun with that.” Even Harris’ own camp appears to be embracing the online buzz. On Sunday, the campaign’s X account, @KamalaHQ, began using Charli XCX’s neon green “brat” theme as its cover image. The X account's two-word bio also quotes Harris' speech. It reads: “Providing context.\" Though young progressives have heavily criticized Harris in the past for her conservative record as a prosecutor, several prominent young left-leaning voter groups were quick to throw their support behind her this week. The social media advocacy group Gen-Z for Change, formerly TikTok for Biden, announced its endorsement of Harris within a few hours after Biden dropped out. Voters of Tomorrow has also rebranded its X page to “brat” green, writing in its social media profile description that Gen Z is in the coconut tree (using emojis to depict the tree). Henry said she believes the support from younger progressives — even those who may not fully agree with all of Harris’ stances — is so suddenly cohesive because “people overwhelmingly understand what is at stake this election cycle.” “Nobody is ignorant to what is at stake and what we are up against, and that means we are going to consolidate and coalesce around who the candidate might be,” she said. “And if it is … Kamala Harris, I think everyone is extremely determined to make sure she wins.”","summary":"Democrats may soon nominate a presidential candidate capable of rivaling GOP nominee Donald Trump in memeability.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/kamala-harris-coconut-tree-internet-memes-gen-z-rcna162977","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-07/240722-KamalaHarrisNCAA-aa-609p-2067ca.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-22 23:40:41","author":"Angela Yang","authors":["Angela Yang"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.297},{"id":252381880,"title":"Biden’s decision to drop out leaves Democrats across the country relieved and looking toward future","text":"HARPER WOODS, Mich.— After weeks of uncertainty about who would be at the top of the Democratic Party’s ticket in November, many voters expressed relief over the news that President Biden would drop his reelection bid and began to think about who might replace him in a dramatically altered election landscape. Jerod Keene, a 40-year-old athletic trainer from swing-state Arizona, had planned to vote for Biden in November but was thankful for the president’s decision, calling it “inevitable.” Keene said he’s excited about the next candidate, hoping it will be Vice President Kamala Harris, whom Biden endorsed on Sunday. “Kamala Harris is the easiest pick based on the fact that she’s vice president and it would be tough for the party to try to go a different direction on that,” said Keene, who lives in Tucson. “And I think she seems ready.” The Democratic Party has been deeply divided since Biden’s poor debate performance on June 27, which left many questioning his ability to defeat Republican Donald Trump in November and secure another term. Party leaders had increasingly called for Biden to step aside, but his reluctance to bow out left voters nationwide uncertain about who would face Trump in November. Recent AP-NORC polling revealed that nearly two-thirds of Democrats felt Biden should withdraw from the presidential race, while a majority believe Harris would perform well in the top slot. Keene’s relief that the saga surrounding Biden’s decision was over was echoed by voters nationwide in interviews with The Associated Press. In key swing states such as Wisconsin, Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Nevada, many expressed optimism about the party’s next nominee — whether it be Harris or someone else. In Pittsburgh, Fred Johnston said he has been terrified of another Trump presidency and had long worried that Biden couldn’t beat Trump again. After seeing Biden’s wobbly debate performance, he was eager for Biden to drop out and hand off his candidacy to Harris. “Kamala is someone we can vote for, and that’s what we need,” Johnston said. He also thinks she can win Pennsylvania: “I have no logical basis for this, but it’s good to have hope. I haven’t had hope for a while.” In Las Vegas, Lucy Ouano, 68, said she was proud of both Biden’s decision to drop out of the race and his move to quickly endorse Harris. “He’s ending on a great note,” Ouano said. “Trump should be worried. He’s now running against someone strong.” Ouano, who emigrated in 1960 to the U.S. from Thailand as a young child with her parents, said she couldn’t have imagined this outcome just a few weeks ago when she attended a Harris rally in Las Vegas meant to quiet concerns about Biden’s reelection campaign. At the time, she told the AP that while she planned on voting for Biden, she wanted Harris at the top of the ticket. “She’s going to get the Asians drummed up, and she’s going to get the women drummed up,” Oaano said Sunday after learning about Biden’s decision. Similarly, Arthur L. Downard Jr., a 72-year-old resident of Portland, Oregon, viewed Biden’s presidency favorably but said he was “very pleased” that Biden stepped aside. The Democratic voter, who cast his ballot for Biden in 2020, said his opinion of Biden changed after what he called a “disastrous” debate. “He’s been a great president and he’s gotten a lot done for our country. But he’s too old, he’s not articulate,” he said. “He’s not a good messenger for the Democratic Party.” Some voters, like Nebraska resident Lacey LeGrand, had planned to reluctantly vote for Biden simply because he wasn’t Trump. “I’m definitely not supporting Trump,” LeGrand said. “So I think by default I was going to end up supporting Biden. I wasn’t very happy about it.” LeGrand, a registered Democrat in Nebraska’s Omaha swing district, a potentially decisive electoral vote that Biden and Obama both won previously, believes Harris “has a shot” at defeating Trump, though she added, “I wouldn’t say it’s a great shot.” But not all voters were happy about Sunday’s news. Georgia voter Dorothy Redhead, 76, was “disappointed” that Biden dropped out of the race but said she is “just having to accept” Biden’s decision as one between the president and God. Jarvia Haynes, a real estate agent in New Orleans, said she has “mixed feelings” about Biden’s decision to leave the race. “I don’t think President Biden should have dropped out,” she said. “On the other hand, maybe it’s for the best.” Haynes, 72, of Harvey, Louisiana, a suburb of New Orleans, quickly focused on who should lead the Democratic ticket, saying she is “very positive about Vice President Kamala Harris being able to handle the job.” She added that she hopes Harris would choose Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer to be her running mate. “I think two women would change the whole dynamic of the race,” said Haynes, who joins Harris as a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc., the first intercollegiate historically African American sorority. The group boasts more than 360,000 members in graduate and undergraduate chapters in 12 countries and could be a formidable political force of its own. Barbara Orr, a psychotherapist in the Lancaster, Pennsylvania area, said she thought Biden was capable of running for president, beating Trump and serving as president. She viewed his decision to end his candidacy, however, as a sign that he is not guided by ego and recognized that, because of his debate performance, voters assume that he can’t do the job. Orr, 65, said she isn’t “super impressed” with Harris, “but she might rise to the occasion. That’s happened before in history.” She also acknowledged that Harris hasn’t had the chance to prove her mettle as a candidate against Trump. Orr, a self-described progressive who favored Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders or Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren for president in 2020, said she would probably prefer Whitmer to replace Biden on the Democratic ticket. “I love what she stands for,” Orr said. Joe DeFrain was out kayaking when a text informed him that Biden had dropped out. While the Grosse Pointe Woods, Michigan, resident said he wasn’t stunned to learn of the development, one thing did surprise him. “I was waiting to see if all the boaters out there were going to be screaming with joy, because a lot of them are Trump fans. And I didn’t hear anything,” DeFrain said after sitting down for dinner at They Say, a restaurant in the Detroit suburb of Harper Woods. Biden visited They Say earlier this year, a moment that manager George Ledbetter said was “the best ever.” Ledbetters’ first reaction to the news came down to a single word: “Why?” “He’s a good president. I like Biden,” Ledbetter said. But, he added, “You gotta do what you gotta do.” Ledbetter said he’ll support Harris despite his disappointment. “I’ll take that, too. I think she can do it. First woman president. That’d be nice. African American president. It’d be nice again,” said Ledbetter, who is Black. As for DeFrain, he said he’ll be watching to see what happens before and during the Democratic National Convention. “It’s going to be something we have never seen in our lifetime,” said DeFrain, who has voted for Democrats in recent elections. “It should be entertaining.” « Previous Next","summary":"Voters nationwide reacted with relief and hope to news that President Biden would drop his reelection bid.","url":"https://www.centralmaine.com/2024/07/22/bidens-decision-to-drop-out-leaves-democrats-across-the-country-relieved-and-looking-toward-future/","image":"https://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/APTOPIX_Election_2024_Biden_Drops_Out_90923_9c63f3-1721692167.jpg?w=1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-22 23:40:02","author":"JOEY CAPPELLETTI,Joey Cappelletti, Mike Householder And Charlotte Kramon,MIKE HOUSEHOLDER and CHARLOTTE KRAMON - Associated Press","authors":["JOEY CAPPELLETTI","Joey Cappelletti, Mike Householder And Charlotte Kramon","MIKE HOUSEHOLDER and CHARLOTTE KRAMON - Associated Press"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0},{"id":252380996,"title":"Sheryl Sandberg endorses Kamala Harris for president","text":"Former Meta COO Sheryl Sandberg endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris for president in social media posts on Monday.\"Vice President @kamalaharris has already made history once — becoming the first Black and South Asian woman to hold her office, and she will do it again in November,\" Sandberg wrote alongside a photo of her and Harris. \"She is an accomplished leader, a fierce advocate of abortion rights, and the strongest candidate to lead our country forward.\"\"I'm thrilled to support her,\" she added.Sandberg, who founded Lean In, a nonprofit that works to support women in the workplace, made the announcement one day after Harris entered the race for president.Sandberg also said Harris \"will defend women's rights — and all Americans' rights — from the Oval Office with a determined, compassionate focus.\"The Harris campaign did not respond to a request for comment on Sandberg's endorsement.

On Monday (July 22), when she appeared in a campaign staff meeting in Wilmington, Del., Harris boldly walked out to Beyoncé‘s “Freedom.” “Freedom,” featuring Kendrick Lamar, was featured on Beyoncé’s 2016 Billboard 200-topping album Lemonade. It earned a 2017 Grammy nomination for best rap/sung performance, while Lemonade won best urban contemporary album and was up for album of the year and best music film. While Beyoncé has not publicly endorsed or commented on Harris’ presidential campaign, her mother Tina Knowles has. “New, Youthful, Sharp , , energy !!!! You asked for it and our President Biden did what was best for the country ! Putting personal Ego , power and fame aside . That is the definition of a great leader, . Thank you, President Biden for your service and your leadership . Go Vice President Kamala Harris for President. Let’s Go #kamala2024,” she wrote in an Instagram post on Sunday, featuring a photo of her with the VP at her daughter’s Renaissance World Tour. Harris attended the show at Landover’s FedEx Field last August with her husband, Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff, last August, and according to financial disclosure reports released in May, Beyoncé gifted them two tickets that were valued at $1655.92, per NBC News.

He called his decision to drop out of the presidential race “the “right thing to do,” CNN reported.Biden made the remarks during a phone call he made into his former campaign’s headquarters to thank the staff and praise Kamala Harris, who visited the Wilmington office on Monday (local time) to visit with staff.During the phone call, Biden directly addressed Harris and the team, saying, “embrace her, she’s the best.”On his announcement to drop out of the presidential race, he called it “suprising news” and emphasised that it’s his belief it was the “right thing to do,” CNN reported.“I know it’s hard because you poured your heart and soul into me,” Biden told the campaign staffers and added, “You’re an amazing team.”The US President expressed gratitude to the staffers for uprooting their lives for him and his now ended campaign. He said that they have built the “best” campaign organisation in history. He said, “I’ve been honoured and humbled.” Biden said, “I’m going to be on the road and I’m not going anywhere.” He stated, “I won’t be on the ticket but I am still going to be fully, fully engaged. I’ve got six months left in my presidency. I’m determined to get as much done as I possibly can both foreign policy and domestic policy,” according to CNN report. Earlier on Sunday, Biden announced his decision to not seek re-election in the “best interest” of the Democratic Party and the country. He has endorsed US Vice President Kamala Harris as the presidential nominee for the Democratic Party and called on Democrats to “come together and beat” Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.In a letter posted on X, Biden stated, “And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term. I will speak to the nation later this week in more detail about my decision.”He also expressed gratitude to US Vice President Kamala Harris for being an “extraordinary partner” for him. He even thanked people who worked for his re-election.He said, “For now, let me express my deepest gratitude to all those who have worked so hard to see me reelected. I want to thank Vice President Kamala Harris for being an extraordinary partner in all this work. And let me express my heartfelt appreciation to the American people for the faith and trust you have placed in me. I believe today what I always have: that there is nothing America can’t do – when we do it together. We just have to remember we are the United States of America.”He said that the US has been a strong economy in the world and they have made historic investments in rebuilding the nation, lowering prescription drug costs for seniors and expanding affordable healthcare to a record number of Americans.Highlighting the achievements of his government in the past, Biden said, “Over the past three and a half years, we have made great progress as a nation. Today, America has the strongest economy in the world. We’ve made historic investments in rebuilding our nation, in lowering prescription drug costs for seniors, and in expanding affordable health care to a record number of Americans.”“We’ve provided critically needed care to a million veterans exposed to toxic substances. Passed the first gun safety law in 30 years. Appointed the first African American woman to the Supreme Court. And passed the most significant climate legislation in the history of the world. America has never been better positioned to lead than we are today,” he added.In a letter, Biden said it had been the greatest honour of his life to serve as US President. Biden noted that the US overcame the COVID-19 pandemic and the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.In a statement posted on social media platform X, Biden recalled that his first decision as the Democratic Party’s nominee in 2020 was to choose Harris as his Vice President, and termed it the best decision he has made.Taking to X, Biden stated, “My fellow Democrats, I have decided not to accept the nomination and to focus all my energies on my duties as President for the remainder of my term. My very first decision as the party nominee in 2020 was to pick Kamala Harris as my Vice President. And it’s been the best decision I’ve made. Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year. Democrats — it’s time to come together and beat Trump. Let’s do this.”Notably, Biden has been isolating at his home in Delaware after testing positive for COVID-19 on Wednesday while he was campaigning in Las Vegas. His announcement to withdraw from the race to be the next president comes following mounting pressure from Democrats after his disastrous performance in the nationally televised debate with former US President Donald Trump on June 27.","summary":"The News Mill","url":"https://thenewsmill.com/2024/07/embrace-her-shes-the-best-us-president-biden-urges-supporters-to-back-kamala-harris/","image":"https://thenewsmill.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/embrace-her-shes-the-best-us-president-biden-urges-supporters-to-back-kamala-harris.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-22 23:34:33","author":"ANI","authors":["ANI"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.183},{"id":252380962,"title":"Mexico Urged by US to Boost Chip Production Within Two Years","text":"In recent years, President Joe Biden’s administration has sought to increase chips manufacturing and compete with Chinese players.

The convention rules committee will meet Wednesday to approve how the virtual roll call will work, but a draft of the plan they are set to approve was obtained by The Associated Press on Monday. The proposal does not list a date for when the virtual roll call begins, but Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison said the process will be completed by Aug. 7. “We can and will be both fast and fair as we execute this nomination,” Harrison on a conference call with reporters. The party says the virtual roll call will potentially feature multiple rounds of voting on nominees. To qualify, candidates must have the electronic signatures of 300 convention delegates. The Democratic National Convention opens in-person on Aug. 19 in Chicago. State delegations to the gathering began pledging their near-unanimous support for Harris in the hours after Biden announced he was abandoning his reelection bid on Sunday. Biden endorsed Harris shortly after announcing he was abandoning his campaign. That doesn’t formally make her the party’s nominee, but the vice president spent hours Sunday calling 100-plus party leaders, members of Congress, labor leaders and leaders of advocacy and civil rights organizations to say she’d earn the nomination in her own right and to ensure they would support her. Harris has since been endorsed by hundreds of Democratic lawmakers, leading governors and some of the country’s most powerful unions, as well as the delegations to the convention from Florida and North and South Carolina. Biden’s departure from the race and endorsement of Harris ended weeks of questions about whether he was up to the rigors of a campaign and a second term in the wake of his dismal debate performance against Republican Donald Trump late last month. Democrats first announced in May that they were resorting to a virtual roll call in order to make a deadline in Ohio and ensure that Biden’s name appeared on the ballot in that state. Ohio lawmakers have since nullified the previous deadline, but the DNC said that, because the change doesn’t take effect until Sept. 1, the party still had to settle its nominee prior to the original deadline or risk legal challenges. In 2020, the in-person Democratic convention was canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic, and states used a virtual process to formally nominate Biden. When they gather in Chicago next month, Democrats will still hold a state-by-state roll call that is a fixture of nominating conventions, although it would largely be ceremonial.

He will be issued a pardon — but only after he has been convicted of, or pleads guilty to, what he has obviously done, significantly mishandling classified documents, obstructing justice and trying to overturn a valid election. People must know that willful mishandling of classified documents and obstructing justice is wrongful and dangerous to our security, and that fomenting distrust in our elections is wrongful and destroys our fabric as a nation. This pledge should be made to help unify our country. And it wouldn’t hurt that it could heighten that candidate’s chances of victory.

She has switched sides before on this issue. As the San Francisco district attorney and as the California attorney general, she was leaning toward the reforms that are needed. But how will she as president impact criminal justice reform on the federal level? Is she for or against mass incarceration? Will she amend long-standing federal sentencing laws? As a justice reform activist, these are the questions I have. Her reforms will affect our nation. Join Crosthwaite Corcoran Democrats must stay focused on winning Thank you Joe Biden for your service to the party and country. Now Democrats must keep the goal of winning this election in perfect focus. Although there’s a lot of excitement about it, the goal is not to elect a woman or a Black woman as president. Clear-eyed Kamala Harris knows the main goal and will get onboard. Poll-testing of potential candidates is critical. Time is of the essence. Democrats must put forth the best candidate to get the job done period! Marcia Hulberg Campbell All immigrants crucial to U.S. economy Re: “Legal immigrants grow our economy” (Page A6, July 18). I’m writing in response to Mike Heller’s letter extolling the benefits of legal immigrants to our economy. That part is true. But he says, “This is what we need more of, not unskilled laborers who slip across our southern border.” Who does he think picks our strawberries and almonds? Who cleans our hotel rooms? Who builds our houses? Who staffs our nursing homes? We can argue about how our labor market should work, but at the present time it works because of unskilled laborers from foreign countries. If Donald Trump gets the chance to deport 11 million workers, you will see how our economy doesn’t work without them. If you think Americans will bring in the harvest, just watch your food prices rise. Jeanie Egbert Alameda DA calls out ‘bias’ where there is none Re: “DA: Death row inmate should be released” (Page B1, July 18). This article characterizes Alameda County prosecutors’ “systematically keeping Black and Jewish people off juries in death penalty cases” as “decades of racism, antisemitism and bigotry.” No. That’s not what it was at all. It may have been illegal but it was not “racism” or “antisemitism,” terms your newspaper uses excessively. Attorneys are given a number of potential jurors they can “excuse” before trial juries are formed, using these “challenges” to “excuse” jurors they believe are more likely to be “biased” against outcomes they seek. Black and Jewish jurors are historically, probabilistically, less likely than average jurors to support the death penalty. So, despite possible illegality, this strategy was pursued to help secure a “friendly” jury. It was not an effort to harm or degrade Black or Jewish people. Excessive, inaccurate use of these terms poisons the civic air we must all breathe. Steve Koppman Oakland Media must offer other parties more coverage Freedom of the press? Free to do what?

The current VP also had the backing of the late Black Panther star for the position she currently holds. In 2020, weeks before his death, Boseman shared his support for Harris as she became Biden’s running mate for the election later that year, when they would be victorious against Trump. “YES @KamalaHarris! ??????,” Boseman posted on Twitter, as X was known back in 2020 before Elon Musk took over. Boseman shared a photo of himself and Harris laughing and hugging. The duo attended the Freedom for Immigrants event in 2018. Boseman also used the hashtags #WhenWeAllVote and #Vote2020. Chadwick died of colon cancer later that month, in August 2020.

Andy Beshear is among the few Democrats likely under consideration to be the party’s vice-presidential candidate in November, and the two-term leader said Monday he’d be willing to listen if Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democrat’s likely nominee, calls him. Beshear appeared Monday on MSNBC’s and said he supported Harris as the party’s candidate in wake of President Joe Biden’s decision less than 24 hours earlier to end his campaign. The governor said he took it as a compliment to the state’s successes that he’s being mentioned for the No. 2 spot. “I love my job, I love serving the people of Kentucky,” he said on the MSNBC morning show. “The only way I would consider something other than this current job is if I believe I could further help my people and to help this country.” A good part of Beshear’s appeal lies in him being a popular Democratic governor in a solidly Republican state. In April, Morning Consult’s quarterly gubernatorial approval polls showed Beshear as the country’s most popular Democratic governor. As he ran successfully for re-election last year, Beshear campaigned as more of a moderate, often saying he wanted to move the state forward and not to the left or right. He wasn’t afraid, though, of taking stances on controversial issues in a mostly conservative state. That included campaigning on abortion access for victims of rape and incest, pushing for the legalization of medical marijuana and rejecting measures to ban gender-affirming care for transgender youth. Republican supermajorities in the General Assembly were able to override the governor’s veto of the latter measure. If Monday’s appearance on MSNBC served as an audition for the vice presidential role, Beshear took advantage of the opportunity to go on the attack against Ohio U.S. Sen. J.D. Vance, who was nominated last week by the GOP. Beshear called out Vance, who often talks about his Kentucky roots and wrote about them in his 2016 memoir Hillbilly Elegy. Vance was born in Ohio but spent several summers of his youth in Eastern Kentucky. Beshear said the interview presented a chance for him to support Harris and defend his people, who he claimed Vance called “lazy.” In his book, Vance scoffed at claims that working-class white people put in more hours than college-educated whites. “I want the American people to know what a Kentuckian is and what they look like because let me just tell you that J.D. Vance ain’t from here,” Beshear said. “The nerve that he has to call the people of Eastern Kentucky lazy. These are the hard-working coal miners that powered the Industrial Revolution. That created the strongest middle class the world has ever seen. That powered us through two world wars. We should be thanking them, not calling them lazy.”","summary":"(The Center Square) – Kentucky Gov.

Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer‘s memoir, True Gretch, jumped to the top of the New York Times Bestseller list amid speculation of a potential vice presidential bid. Despite her emphatic denials, the governor has been subject to rampant rumors of a potential 2024 presidential bid for months, as some Democrats and donors pushed for her as an alternative to President Biden. Now that Democrats are rallying around Vice President Kamala Harris following Joe Biden’s decision to bow out of the race, Whitmer is being touted as a possible pick for the vice presidency. Whitmer co-chaired Biden’s reelection campaign and has signed on to the same role for Harris’ campaign, but she flat-out denied interest in being Harris’ #2, saying “I am not leaving Michigan.” Whitmer’s denials haven’t dampened enthusiasm around the governor, as True Gretch jumped to #3 and #4 on the Times‘ Combined Print & E-Book Nonfiction and Hardcover Nonfiction lists, respectively. It’s the only book in the top 10 that’s new to the lists this week. The memoir was published on July 9 by Simon and Schuster and is subtitled “What I’ve Learned About Life, Leadership, and Everything in Between.” It also sits at number 14 on Amazon’s nonfiction charts. The memoir is a lean 176 pages, and delves into consequential moments in Whitmer’s governorship, now in its second and final term. In a candid and often humorous tone, she writes about Michigan’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic and other moments in her career and life. She discusses tangling with the Trump White House to secure FEMA money and PPE during the pandemic, as well as the plot by a right-wing militia group to kidnap her, which was foiled by the FBI. The memoir is in e-book or hardcover formats. The audiobook version, narrated by Whitmer, is available through Amazon with a two-month free Audible Premium Plus trial. The memoir can also be found at Barnes & Noble, Bookshop.org, ThriftBooks, and independent bookstores.","summary":"Whitmer may have denied interest in being Kamala Harris' VP, but that hasn't dampened enthusiasm around the governor","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/product-recommendations/books/gretchen-whitmer-book-read-memoir-audiobook-1235065361/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/GettyImages-1242267830c.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-22 23:28:00","author":"Jonathan Zavaleta","authors":["Jonathan Zavaleta"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.422},{"id":252381084,"title":"Illinois Police release bodycam video of fatal shooting of Black woman in her home","text":"(CNN) — Body-camera footage showing the fatal police shooting of Sonya Massey, a 36-year-old Black woman who had called 911 for help, was released publicly Monday in a case that has led to murder charges against a deputy. The 36-minute video released via the Illinois State Police includes body-camera footage from each of the two Sangamon County Sheriff’s deputies who responded to Massey’s house after midnight on July 6 after Massey called 911 to report a possible “prowler” at her home in Springfield, according to a court document filed by prosecutors. In the footage, deputy Sean Grayson and another deputy speak calmly with Massey in her home when she goes to the stove to turn off a pot of boiling water. She then picks up the pot and the other deputy steps back, “away from your hot steaming water,” he says. “I rebuke you in the name of Jesus,” she says in response. “Huh?” the deputy says. “I rebuke you in the name of Jesus,” she repeats. “You better f**king not or I swear to God I’ll f**king shoot you in the f**king face,” Grayson says. He then draws his firearm and points it at her, and she ducks and says, “I’m sorry” while lifting the pot, the video shows. “Drop the f**king pot!” both deputies yell. Three shots are heard. After a few seconds of silence, one deputy says “shots fired” and calls for EMS. “Dude, I’m not taking f**king boiling water to the f**king head. And look, it came right to our feet, too,” Grayson says. Minutes after the shooting, Grayson speaks to another law enforcement figure. “She had boiling water and came at me with boiling water,” he says in the video. “She said she was going to rebuke me in the name of Jesus and came at (me) with boiling water.” CNN has reached out to Grayson’s attorney for comment. The release of the video comes about two weeks after the fatal shooting and just days after Grayson was charged in her death. Grayson, 30, was indicted by a grand jury last week on three counts of first-degree murder and one count each of aggravated battery with a firearm and official misconduct. He has entered a not guilty plea and was denied pretrial release, according to court records. Massey is one of a number of Black women who have been killed by police in their own homes in recent years, including Breonna Taylor and Atatiana Jefferson. In a news conference Monday afternoon, civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who represents Massey’s family, connected her death to other cases of police violence against Black people across the US. “Until we get justice for Sonya Massey, we rebuke this discriminatory criminal justice system in the name of Jesus,” he said. Video shows lead-up and aftermath Grayson did not activate his body camera until after he fatally shot Massey, according to charging documents. The other deputy had activated his body camera when he first arrived at the scene, the documents state. According to footage from the other deputy’s body camera, the incident began with the deputies walking around Massey’s yard and finding a vehicle with broken windows. They then knock on the door and speak with her, and she struggles to understand and answer some questions about the vehicle and about herself. As they speak in her living room, the deputies note the pot on the lit stove and one says, “we don’t need a fire while we’re here.” Massey gets up and turns off the stove and the shooting then follows. Immediately after the shooting, the video records Grayson telling his partner Massey would not need medical help. The other deputy says he’s going to get a medical kit to help, but Grayson responds, “Nah, she’s done. You can go get it but that’s a headshot.” Grayson later goes to his vehicle to get his own medical supplies. When he gets back to the house, he asks if there’s anything he can do, but is told no. “All right, I’m not even gonna waste my med stuff then,” Grayson says. Next, Grayson leaves the house and speaks to a group of law enforcement officers outside. “Yeah I’m good, this f**king b*tch is crazy,” he says, according to the footage. In the news conference Monday, along with members of her family, Crump said Massey had mental health challenges but was not aggressive toward the deputies. “She needed a helping hand,” he said. “She didn’t need a bullet to the face.” Massey’s father, James Wilburn, said he initially received conflicting information from law enforcement. “I was under the impression that a prowler had broken in and killed my baby. Never did they say that it was a deputy-involved shooting until my brother read it on the internet,” Wilburn said. Officials criticize deputy’s actions Since the shooting, local and state officials have criticized the deputy’s actions as an unjustified use of deadly force. A review of the Illinois State Police investigation into the shooting “does not support a finding that … Grayson was justified in his use of deadly force,” the state’s attorney for the county, John Milhiser, said in a July 17 news release. In a court document filed by the state last week, prosecutors said a “use-of-force” expert had reviewed the body-camera footage and concluded the use of deadly force was not justified. “(The expert) likened the scenario to an officer intentionally and unnecessarily putting himself in front of a moving vehicle and then justifying use of force because of fear of being struck,” the prosecutors wrote. The sheriff’s office said it has fired Grayson. “It is clear that the deputy did not act as trained or in accordance with our standards,” the office said. CNN experts offered similar analysis. “Effective policing comes down to good judgment in highly stressful situations,” said Josh Campbell, CNN security correspondent and former federal agent. “Although being doused with scalding water could warrant the use of deadly force by an officer to stop a threat, in this video we certainly don’t see officers attempting alternative options, such as moving away and creating distance between themselves and Massey.” “There were a number of ways to avoid this starting with better tactics from the outset,” said CNN Chief Law Enforcement and Intelligence Analyst John Miller, “but even if you forgive that and limit the observations to the last few seconds, there were still options of a calmer dialogue, more distance between the subject and them, a taser rather than a firearm.” President Joe Biden said in a statement Monday that Massey’s family “deserves justice.” “I am heartbroken for her children and her entire family as they face this unthinkable and senseless loss. Jill and I mourn with the rest of the country and our prayers are with Sonya’s family, loved ones, and community during this devastating time,” Biden said in a written statement. “I commend the swift actions that were taken by the Springfield State’s Attorney’s office. While we wait for the case to be prosecuted, let us pray to comfort the grieving. Congress must pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act now. Our fundamental commitment to justice is at stake,” the president added. Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul issued a statement Monday saying the footage was “horrific” and offering his sympathy to Massey’s family. “As the community reacts to the release of the footage, I urge calm as this matter works its way through the criminal justice system,” he said. “In Illinois we have made sure that the law mandates independent investigations after officer involved shootings. In this matter it appears that the investigation by the Illinois State Police and the subsequent referral to the Sangamon County State’s Attorney’s office have complied with the letter and spirit of the law by providing the appropriate transparency and moving toward accountability,” Raoul added.

Williams, 68, initially voiced his support for Wes Moore to lead the Democratic presidential ticket after Joe Biden stepped down Sunday, saying he’d be “ready to campaign” if the Maryland governor was on the ballot. “I’ve watched @GovWesMoore lead my home state of Maryland, and I know leadership when I see it,” Williams wrote in a post on X Monday morning. After receiving an apparent deluge of reactions from the post Williams appeared to clarify his comments, hours later retweeting a post from Gov. Moore endorsing Harris. “Reminding folks I RT’d this,” Williams said in a follow up post. The pair dated briefly around 2001, and were photographed walking the red carpet together at a multiple sclerosis benefit gala in California that year. Harris was working as an attorney when she and Williams dated, and little is known about their relationship. Williams seemed to anticipate the attention he was going to receive after Biden withdrew and endorsed Harris — asking his followers to guess “how many creepy media requests” he was going to receive after the news. A representative for him even went on the defensive, promising to repost every media inquiry they receive asking “creepy, misogynistic” questions for comment about Williams’ relationship with Harris. Williams — a Maryland native who made history as the first black Marine to be accepted into the U.S. Navy’s officer training program — further hit back at criticisms of his endorsement for Gov. Moore over Harris by saying it was no surprise he was impressed by a fellow veteran. “Is anyone surprised I am interested in a politician who also went to the Naval Academy and whose leadership has impressed me?” Williams wrote.","summary":"The pair dated briefly around 2001, and were photographed walking the red carpet together at a multiple sclerosis benefit gala in California that year.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/07/22/us-news/montel-williams-sort-of-endorses-ex-kamala-harris-for-president/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/montel-williams-kamala-harris-attend-85842362.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/fW11Y3Jf-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-22 23:24:31","author":"Alex Oliveira","authors":["Alex Oliveira"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.017},{"id":252380742,"title":"You think this Kamala Harris meme fell out of a coconut tree? How the VP became the pop girlie of the summer","text":"Ever since President Joe Biden announced on Sunday that he would not seek reelection and instead threw his support behind his VP, the Kamala Harris memes have been flooding in — particularly one referencing coconut trees. As if this election cycle weren't strange enough, the mashing-up of Kamala Harris laughing about coconut trees with Charli XCX's \"Brat\" as a motivating force behind the presumed future Democratic nominee for president of these United States certainly adds another layer of WTF-ism.

Well, back in May, Veep was making a speech at a White House event for advancing opportunities for Hispanic Americans. To really drive her point home about none of us \"living in a silo\" and \"everything\" being in \"context,\" Harris shared an anecdote about her mother. \"My mother...would give us a hard time sometimes, and she would say to us, 'I don’t know what’s wrong with you young people. You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?'\" Harris said, laughing at her own joke in true Fun Aunt fashion. \"You exist in the context of all in which you live and what came before you.\" At the time, the internet had a field day with the clip, implying that the VP was drunk or high or both. But with the ascension of Donald Trump and the GOP, coinciding with the decline of Biden and the Democrats, the internet has redeemed the clip the best way it knows how: pop music. Seemingly overnight, industrious online nerds have mashed-up Harris' \"coconut\" speech with some of their fave pop girlies, including Taylor Swift's \"Shake It Off,\" Britney Spears' \"Gimme More,\" and Charli XCX's bop of the summer, \"Brat.\" The Harris campaign even adopted Charli XCX's lime green \"Brat\" aesthetic for its X account, and the British singer-songwriter was quick to give it her presidential seal of approval, tweeting, \"kamala IS brat.\" Whether leaning into the pop girlie ecosystem will give Harris the edge to clinch the Democratic nomination and eventually the presidency remains to be seen — but, hey, we've got (checks blood pressure) three and a half months till the election.

It’s a testament to how ingrained the platform has become among the power players of the political and media world, as well as users looking for news and live updates of major events. While Meta’s Facebook and Instagram, along with TikTok, boast far more users, X users say keeping up with the news is not the reason they use those platforms, according to a recent survey by the Pew Research Center. X is the exception: most of the site’s users say following the news is a reason they use it and about half say they regularly get their news from there. “X is where history happens,” posted X CEO Linda Yaccarino on Sunday with a screenshot of Biden’s announcement. While a comment pointed out that the same message was posted on other social media platforms as well, the narrative remains an important one for X and its long-touted efforts to become a “digital town square.” “Other platforms have emerged with the goal of supplanting X, but what events like the Biden post shows is that this is still where people go to make both fast and consequential impact,” said Sarah Kreps, director of Cornell University’s Tech Policy Institute. That’s even though the site has become a less reliable place to find accurate information, due in large part to changes Musk made since assuming the helm. Since the 2022 takeover, Musk has upended many of the former Twitter’s policies including around misinformation and hate speech, gutted its staff and transformed what people see on the site. “It does not appear as though would-be competitors have been able to displace Twitter from its perch as the go-to place for political news,” Kreps said. “In an ideal world, a lot of people would have and did try to go elsewhere but these alternatives needed to offer products that people want and use and they have not done that. Until that time, we’ll probably see a segment of users for whom their principles and practices are at odds.” As its owner and arguably most influential user, Musk has also used X to try to sway political discourse around the world — getting in a dustup with a Brazilian judge over censorship, railing against what he calls the “woke mind virus” and amplifying false claims that Democrats are secretly flying in migrants to vote in U.S. elections. Long before he endorsed Trump, Musk turned increasingly toward the right in his posts and actions on the platform. He’s reinstated previously banned accounts such as the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and former U.S. President Donald Trump, as well as accounts belonging to neo-Nazis and white supremacists. Advertisers who halted spending on X in response to antisemitic and other hateful material were engaging in “blackmail,” Musk has alleged. And it was on X that he announced he was moving the company’s headquarters, as well as those of SpaceX, to the red state of Texas from deep blue California. “The important thing about Twitter has long been the community of users who’ve embraced it. And there is a proliferation of journalists and elected officials and thought leaders who still use it today,” said Mark Jablonowski, chief technology officer at DSPolitical, a digital advertising firm that works for Democratic campaigns. “And it is an effective way of rapidly getting a message out to a large and influential group of people. However, that group is clearly waning. You are seeing users of the platform jumping ship, left and right. And as you are seeing the content become more and more extreme and unsuitable for general consumption.” Biden’s message Sunday was posted on X two minutes before it went up on Meta platforms such as Facebook and Threads. It’s not clear if this was intentional, and the campaign did not immediately respond to a message for comment on Monday. “It might have been just, you know, who hit enter first on the keyboard internally,” Jablonowski said. “But I think you definitely are seeing a world where five years ago, this might have been exclusively on Twitter, and now you’re seeing it across many different properties.” Political campaigns, he noted, need to meet voters where the voters are — and for many, that is still X. “Democrats still do appearances on Fox News,” he said. When it comes to advertising dollars, however, “the money is clearly going to Meta properties and YouTube. I don’t know, at least on the Democratic side, many, if any campaigns that are looking to spend advertising dollars on (X).”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nA week after Elon Musk endorsed Donald Trump for president, President Joe&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Regardless of Musk supporting Trump, X is still a popular platform for Democrats first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/regardless-of-musk-supporting-trump-x-is-still-a-popular-platform-for-democrats/","image":"https://www.clickorlando.com/resizer/B6LM_gcqvDYYKTuiItMrc31UMac=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gmg/C625INPO3ZB7PHXVGPAR6NGHBA.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-22 23:21:30","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.105},{"id":252380230,"title":"Bizarre images show Putin in rainbow dress alongside world leaders strutting down catwalk in AI-generated fashion show","text":"RUSSIAN tyran Vladimir Putin struts down the catwalk in a rainbow Louis Vuitton dress in this AI-generated fashion show.
