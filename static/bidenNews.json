Around 9pm local time, the former president appeared in front of a blaze of lightbulbs spelling out ‘TRUMP’, a showbiz backdrop redolent of Elvis in his Las Vegas heyday. In silhouette, he looked like a minotaur: bulky in the shoulders but light in the hooves as he trotted over to the lectern. His right ear was still bandaged, occasionally he sweated under the spotlights and in mood he switched from folksy and emotional to pugnacious and aggrieved, then back again. ‘There is love in the room, there is big love in the room,’ Trump purred, before promising to stop all wars, introduce tax cuts, make cities safe again, boost oil and gas production and sort out that illegal migration mess down Mexico way. ‘Drill baby, drill! And close our borders,’ he bellowed, as the fevered crowd roared their approval. But not everyone was pleased. ‘Was there anything in there for the moderates?’ fretted a host on NBC News. There was little room for moderation in the 18,000 capacity Convention Hall, where Trump was given a hero’s welcome from the nailed-on fans, senators and delegates known variously as Trumpers, Trumplicans, Trump Boosters, Trumpists and Trumpites. The 78-year-old leader began his epic 93-minute speech by describing in detail what it’s like to be the target of an assassination attempt, adding that he would never tell the story again because it was ‘too painful’ to recount. This was gripping; raw history being played out on millions of television screens across America. For no one needed reminding that too few presidents, serving or otherwise, have lived to tell the tale. ‘The bullet came within a quarter inch of taking my life,’ he began. ‘Trump, Trump, Trump,’ chanted the crowd, some of them already in tears. ‘I felt very safe because I had God on my side. I’m not supposed to be here tonight,’ he continued. ‘Yes you are, yes you are, yes you are!’ intoned the party faithful. ‘I stand before you in this arena only by the grace of Almighty God,’ he said. ‘USA! USA! USA!’ they cried. Had the shooting changed something in Trump? Tucker Carlson, America’s most influential Right-wing media commentator, seemed to think so. In a speech onstage earlier, the man who proved too toxic even for Fox News, argued that everything was different now. ‘The nation is different, the world is different. Donald Trump is different. When he stood up after being shot and put his hand up, I thought at that moment that was a transformation. I think it was divine intervention.’ That might be pushing it a bit but who can know what goes through a man’s heart and soul when someone tries and fails to kill them by a fraction of an inch? Certainly, it seems clear that Trump feels touched by the hand of God and appears to be invigorated with a new sense of purpose. On an interview with CBS Mornings, on Thursday, his daughter-in-law Lara Trump – wife of his second son Eric – put forward her view. ‘I don’t think you can go through a near-death experience and not come out on the other side impacted,’ she said, meaning mentally, I presume. Lara was there last night, seated with the rest of the Trump family in a little enclave in the arena. There were the First Sons – Eric and Donald Junior – there was Ivanka and Jared, there were the assorted Trumpkin grandchildren, cute as buttons. Everyone was poodle-groomed within an inch of their lives, all were togged out in red, white and blue, like a patriotic but blond Addams Family. No one looked as marvellous as Melania of course, polished and exquisite in her perfectly fitted red Dior suit, but remote as a satellite as always. Everyone had to sit through hours and hours of warm-up speeches, including contributions from Kid Rock (a dull rap song) and former wrestler Hulk Hogan who paid tribute to Trump as ‘my hero, the gladiator’, someone who was going to ‘straighten the country out for all the real Americans’. Even Eric got in on the action. ‘Your conviction is truly next level,’ he said to his father. ‘I am honoured to be your son, our country loves you. One of the most courageous acts in the history of American politics was when you shouted: ‘Fight-fight-fight’.’ ‘Fight, fight, fight,’ chanted the crowd, cheerfully oblivious to hyperbole. Out on the floor, many of the delegates wore cowboy hats, some had MAGA caps, while the legendary Wisconsin delegation – called the ‘Cheeseheads’ – wear wedges of foam cheese on their heads in honour of their state’s impressive dairy production. As a sign of respect, they take them off when singing the national anthem or in moments of high emotion. O ne came when Trump was explaining that there was so much blood when he got shot because of the location. ‘Doctors told me it’s the ears, they bleed more than any other part of the body. So we learn something,’ he said. Indeed we do. What I have learned is how you feel about Donald Trump’s ear bandage reveals how you feel about Donald Trump. In the days preceding his keynote speech there was grumbling from Democrats and Leftists that the former president was milking it; wearing that big ol’ patch like a badge of courage, flaunting his wound like a gauze pennant fluttering on the presidential battlefield. MSNBC host Ari Melber was one of the disbelievers, snorting that the ear bandage was ‘a spectacle’ when Trump made his first appearance inside the hall after being shot. And out on the badlands of X, formerly known as Twitter, there was a typical exchange of half-baked misinformation. Someone called Peggy Vandervoort wrote that ‘Trump’s huge pad bandage on his ear is a PR stunt’. Her source on this was that well known gunshot trauma expert, Martina Navratilova. According to Peggy, the tennis champ had ‘just posted saying her close friend is a nurse from Major Trauma in a big city and concurred that ‘there is no need to dress an ear wound like this, even if half the ear was blown off’.’ Martina had done no such thing. She had reposted a post from someone called LazarTagWolf (Good cook. Stones fan. Native Californian. Biden/Harris Dem. Taurus. Tall in Socks) and it was HER friend who was the charge nurse. ‘It wouldn’t look like this,’ Lazar insisted, and Martina agreed. ‘Of course this is obviously a stunt,’ tweeted Navratilova. ‘The day after the shooting he had no bandage on his ear, not even a Band Aid.’ She was referring to a widely circulated photograph of Trump playing golf used as evidence for this stunt bandage theory, even though it had been taken the week before the shooting. During an appearance on Fox & Friends on Wednesday, son Donald Trump Jr expressed his understandable disgust. ‘He wasn’t shot in the face enough for them? It wasn’t enough?’ he said, explaining the sceptical reactions as part of something he calls The Trump Derangement Syndrome. ‘You can see the photograph at the time. There’s blood everywhere,’ he added. Trump Derangers include Whoopi Goldberg, who complained about the former president’s 17-year-old granddaughter Kai taking to the stage to ‘show a side of my grandpa that people don’t often see’. ‘They are trying to humanise him, don’t fall for it,’ said Whoopi on ABC talk show The View. But others went too far. The actor Jack Black, who also fronts a comedy rock band called Tenacious D, was forced to cancel his group’s Australian tour when a bandmate expressed a wish that the shooter ‘didn’t miss next time’ – a repellent comment about an assassination attempt that killed one bystander and critically injured two others. By Wednesday, convention attendees began wearing their own ear bandages in support. It seemed to start with Arizona delegate Joe Neglia. ‘I thought, ‘What can I do to honour the truth? What can I possibly do?’ he told Fox News Digital. ‘And then I saw the bandage and I thought, I can do that. I put it on to honour Trump and express sympathy and unity.’ It caught on like a contagion. Bandaged ears soon appeared all over the hall, like Life Of Brian disciples suffering amid an ear plague but still worshipping the new messiah. Emily Maitlis was in Milwaukee reporting for her News Agents podcast and had called the delegates ‘weirdos and misfits’ even before the sympathy bandages appeared. I thought it rather a gratuitous sneer at thousands of people expressing their sincerely held political beliefs but that is Emily for you. ‘The conversations in this hall are utterly dystopian,’ she reported to co-host John Sopel. ‘I think it has become more cultish, I genuinely think the people who are spouting this garbage are starting to believe it.’ Bit rich, considering that for 16 years she worked for the biggest and most invidious cult of all: the BBC. Meanwhile, large parts of America are still in shock and distress over what happened last Saturday night. It comes at a time when the moral code of the country seems to be unspooling, amid a backdrop of ideological and partisan divisions along with cultural and political hostilities. There is unease, there is disinformation, there are worries about the incapacity of Joe Biden, about war, migrants, house prices, climate change, drug wars, gun violence and hate speech. Is Donald Trump the man to bring the country together and move forward as one into the golden future he promises, or will he only deepen divisions, just like before? CNN have already listed ‘more than twenty false claims’ they allege he made in his acceptance speech. At the end of this very long night, Pastor Franklin Graham came on and made everyone stand and ‘pray to the heavenly father for saving the life of Donald J Trump’. The Trumplicans sprang up as one. The Cheeseheads took their cheeses off. Donald bowed his head for a moment and Melania appeared on stage to congratulate her husband. ‘Good job,’ she said, as if he’d just put some cutlery back in the correct drawer. Then the couple did one of their awkward, fumbled public kisses, acting like two blind tortoises who are allergic to each other trying to gum the same leaf of lettuce. Then thousands of balloons fell from the ceiling in the traditional euphoric finale and NBC asked a delegate what she thought of Trump now. ‘I think the spirit of the loving God is in him,’ she said, her eyes shining. Amen to that.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nAt the end of one of the most incredible weeks in American&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Observing Trump&#8217;s enthusiastic welcome at the Republican Convention &#8211; JAN MOIR reflects on his kiss with Melania and his peculiar bandaged ears first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/observing-trumps-enthusiastic-welcome-at-the-republican-convention-jan-moir-reflects-on-his-kiss-with-melania-and-his-peculiar-bandaged-ears/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/rewrite-this-title-Trump-and-Melania-kissed-like-two-blind.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-20 00:15:57","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.043},{"id":252195346,"title":"Brittney Griner and wife Cherelle welcome first baby","text":"Brittney Griner and wife Cherelle have welcomed their first baby. In a July 19 interview with CBS Sports, the 33-year-old basketball player revealed that she and her wife Cherelle, 32, welcomed a baby boy on July 8. As she smiled ear-to-ear, Griner added that she’d be called “pops.” “That’s my man. He is amazing,” Brittney said, adding that their son weighed 7 pounds and 8 ounces. “They said as soon as you see them, everything that you thought mattered just goes out the window. That’s literally what happened.” When asked about having to leave her newborn to compete during WNBA All-Star weekend in Phoenix, and later the 2024 Paris Olympics to represent Team USA for the third time, Brittney admitted feeling mixed emotions. “It kind of sucks because I have to leave, but at the same time, he will understand,” Brittney said, adding that she’ll have plenty of photos of him to look at while in Paris. “My whole phone has turned into him now.” In April, the couple announced the pregnancy on social media. They wrote in a caption: “Can’t believe we’re less than three months away from meeting our favorite human being.” The WNBA star and the attorney first met as students at Baylor University in Texas, which they attended between 2009 and 2013. “I will never forget the day I met you at Baylor in the sub area!” the WNBA star wrote on Instagram in June 2020. “You tapped me on my shoulder and told me I took your milkshake (still up for debate lol) and I was immediately blown away at your beauty!” Although the two didn’t start dating until two years later, Brittney remembered it was love at first sight. “You had no idea but I knew you were the one for me baby. You stuck by my side at the lowest and at the highest!” The couple have been through a tough few years after Griner was detained in Russia for 10 months on drug charges in 2022. She was eventually released in a prisoner swap for international arms dealer Viktor Bout on December 8, 2022. At the time, President Joe Biden signed off on the trade, which occurred in the United Arab Emirates. On X, formerly known as Twitter, he posted: “Moments ago I spoke to Brittney Griner. She is safe. She is on a plane. She is on her way home.” Cherelle recalled seeing Brittney after her detainment to People. “I had thought about that moment a thousand times, and I thought I would be full of tears,” Cherelle told the outlet. “But I was overwhelmingly happy. It was the first time I was able to finally exhale.”","summary":"The WNBA star and the attorney first met as students at Baylor University in Texas","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/brittney-griner-wife-cherelle-baby-b2582875.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/07/19/23/newFile-1.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-20 00:04:01","author":"Olivia Hebert","authors":["Olivia Hebert"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.126},{"id":252195274,"title":"Trump speaks with Zelensky over phone to discuss conflict in Ukraine","text":"NEW YORK, July 20. /TASS/.

Biden had planned to raise money in Austin, Denver and California next week, but these plans have been shelved, at least for now, the sources said. The president tested positive for COVID-19 on Wednesday but said today he would return to the campaign trail next week. Biden’s campaign said his fundraisers would go ahead as planned. “Reuters’ sourcing is incorrect, and we look forward to a robust fundraising schedule,” campaign spokesman Kevin Munoz said today. A source familiar with the situation said former late-night comic David Letterman would headline a fundraiser for Biden at the home of Hawaii Governor Josh Green in about 10 days, a sign of forward movement for Biden. A number of big donors are closing their checkbooks amid questions about whether Biden should remain at the top of the Democratic Party ticket, the sources said, using their financial clout to tell Biden to drop out of the Nov. 5 race, potentially in favor of Vice President Kamala Harris. The campaign hoped to raise some $50 million in big-dollar donations in July for the Biden Victory fund but was on track for less than half that figure as of today, according to two sources familiar with the fundraising efforts. “There are a lot of donors who have said they won’t put another dime in this race. The question is if Biden stays in the race, will they come back?” said one major East Coast campaign financier. Biden raised $28 million in one night in June at a Hollywood fundraiser that was hosted by the actor George Clooney, who later urged Biden to end his campaign. Harris will talk to major donors today at the request of advisers to the president, according to a source familiar with the plan. Fundraising from megadonors was expected to drop from June to July due to many of these people taking vacations, a campaign official told Reuters today. “This narrative that high-dollar fundraising has dried up is wrong,” the official said. The official noted that the campaign has 10 campaign fundraisers on the schedule for this month. More than one in 10 congressional Democrats have now publicly called on the incumbent to drop out following a disastrous June debate against Republican Donald Trump that raised questions about Biden’s ability to win or to carry out his duties for another four years. NOMINATING PROCESS MOVES FORWARD The official party process to nominate Biden is advancing. The Democratic National Convention Rules Committee met today to outline a virtual voting process to bring forward the official nomination of the 81-year-old before the party’s in-person convention starts Aug. 19 in Chicago. Officials argued an early nomination is needed to more easily comply with state election laws or risk being left off the November ballot. “They’re not risks that we as a party can or should take,” Dana Remus, Biden’s former White House counsel, told the committee. For a party already divided over Biden, with fresh calls today from Democrats in Congress to leave, the early virtual vote is another point of controversy. Critics argue it is a means of pushing Biden through early as the party’s official nominee. Others, including DNC Chair Jaime Harrison, say it is necessary to deal with an Ohio law that could have kept Biden’s name off ballots in the state if he wasn’t nominated by Aug. 7, prior to the convention in Chicago. A member of the rules committee asked whether it was possible that another candidate could challenge Biden in a virtual vote. Leah Daughtry, the committee’s co-chair, said any challenger would need the “verified support of hundreds of delegates.” “Such a challenge has never happened over the past half-century of competitive primaries,” Daughtry said. It was unclear how the nominating process would unfold if Biden were to abandon his reelection bid. The committee is expected to meet again next week to finalize the plan. Biden has been isolating since he tested positive for COVID this week and was believed to be taking calls to step aside seriously. Several Democratic officials think an exit is a matter of time, Reuters reported on Thursday. “The writing is on the wall,” said a Democratic donor today. Biden has insisted for weeks that he would stay in the race despite calls from heavyweights in his party to cede his position. Trump, 78, accepted the Republican Party’s nomination this week in Milwaukee, speaking before a rapt audience on Thursday. Some Democrats have begun advertising against Biden. Pass the Torch, a group that wants Biden to step down, has launched a TV ad to air in Washington and Rehoboth, Delaware, where Biden frequently vacations, and features Democratic voters from Pennsylvania urging Biden to “pass the torch.”","summary":"Several of President Joe Biden&#8217;s reelection campaign fundraisers are on hold, multiple Democratic sources involved in the events told Reuters today, even as the Democratic Party planned to accelerate his nomination and he vowed to continue in the 2024 race.","url":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2024/07/19/breaking-news/biden-fundraisers-on-hold-july-donations-plunge-sources-say/","image":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/web1_20240719_brk_bid03.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-19 23:50:00","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.193},{"id":252195270,"title":"This Is Why Your Drug Prices Might Be Changing","text":"When President Joe Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act into law in 2022, the U.S. government gained the ability to negotiate prices on expensive prescription drugs for the first time ever. Though the bill’s effects will not be felt until 2026, it is intended to lower costs for covered users by billions of dollars annually, passing savings onto taxpayers.Who Does This Affect?The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is negotiating prices for 60 drugs for Medicare beneficiaries by 2028. Medicare Part A is hospital insurance, Part B is medical insurance, Part C (also known as Medicare Advantage) is a private plan approved by Medicare that offers additional insurance, and Part D is insurance for prescription drugs. According to program data, 67.2 million people were enrolled in Medicare as of March 2024. Private health insurers already negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical companies, and the IRA does not affect this.When Will Prices Change?Last year, HHS selected the first 10 drugs for price negotiation, and the agreed-upon prices will go into effect in 2026. Related StoriesBig Pharma CEOs Testify to Senate on Prescription Drug Prices2/8/2024Drug Prices Rose Nearly 40 Percent Over Past Decade, Surpassing Inflation Rate, Tracker Shows6/30/2024 From 2027 onwards, HHS will select 20 additional drugs each year for negotiation, with prices taking effect two years later.Which Drugs Will Have Prices Negotiated?The first 10 drugs selected were Eliquis, Jardiance, Xarelto, Januvia, Farxiga, Entresto, Enbrel, Imbruvica, Stelara, and Fiasp (also sold under Fiasp FlexTouch, Fiasp PenFill, NovoLog, NovoLog FlexPen, or NovoLog PenFill). About 7.7 million Medicare enrollees (approximately 15 percent of Medicare Part D employees in 2022) spent $46.4 billion on these 10 drugs from the start of June 2022 to the end of May 2023, making up about 20 percent of drug spending covered by Part D. This included $3.4 billion in out-of-pocket costs. The drugs must have no generic or biosimilar competition and cannot be “orphan drugs,“ which are intended to treat often life-threatening conditions that affect fewer than 200,000 people. They also cannot be ”low-spend” drugs on which less than $200 million is spent under Medicare Part B and Part D per year unless they are small biotech drugs. After the government makes its list of drugs, it will make an offer, and drug manufacturers will have a deadline to present a counteroffer. After the negotiation period, CMS will publish final agreed-upon prices before they go into effect the following year. A drug company may opt out of negotiations, pulling the product from Medicare and Medicaid, or opt out of negotiations but pay a large tax that may result in a higher cost for the manufacturer than the price of negotiations. Medicare Plan D is required to carry at least two drugs in each of the most commonly prescribed categories and classes. This requirement ensures that patients have access to a variety of medications. With the planned volume of drugs slated for negotiation, it may be unlikely that a manufacturer declining to negotiate would conflict with this rule. CMS did not comment by the time of this publication.How Much Will Prices Change?We won’t know for sure until the new prices are released on Sept. 1. CMS is required to consider several factors as it makes initial offers in drug price negotiations, including the cost of developing the drug and its cost of production; whether federal funding contributed to the development of the drug; U.S. market data; and data regarding the drug’s patents, sales, and revenue. According to the ASPE analysis, seven of the first 10 drugs selected for price negotiation received some sort of federal support. This is not only limited to direct funding but also includes claiming tax credits on research and development costs or obtaining a “government interest” patent. The ASPE argues that such assistance should factor into negotiations. In addition to the negotiations, the IRA applies an inflation rebate, requiring drug companies to pay back Medicare if they raise their prices higher than the rate of inflation. This resulted in 64 drugs through Medicare Part B having lowered coinsurance rates starting July 1. Some 750,000 people use these drugs, and they could save as much as $4,000 this year. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates the price negotiations will save $25 billion through 2031. Another provision of the IRA caps out-of-pocket costs for individuals. In 2026, that cap will be lowered to $2,000.Lawsuits in ProgressEven before the first 10 drugs were selected for negotiation, pharmaceutical companies filed more than a dozen lawsuits against the government arguing the new rule was unconstitutional. A case brought by Astellas Pharma was dropped after the list of 10 was released, as it did not include drugs by Astella—specifically, the prostate cancer treatment Xtandi. U.S. District Judge Michael Shea ruled in favor of the government in a case brought by Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) Pharmaceuticals just this month. Georgetown University Law Center’s O'Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law has a litigation tracker that displays the progress of each lawsuit, important court dates, and court filings. Medicare already sets prices for other services, such as with physicians and hospitals, and the relationship with drug companies is actually the exception rather than the norm. According to a Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) analysis of drug spending, by 2017, Medicare accounted for 40 percent of the U.S. market for prescription pharmaceuticals. KFF is an independent health policy information organization.Ripple EffectSome experts and lawmakers who voted against various iterations of the IRA have voiced concern over the unintended negative effects of Medicare price negotiations while acknowledging that the concerns remain hypothetical due to the complex nature of drug sales and pricing. However, the counterargument is that drug companies have, over the years, increasingly left this kind of research and development up to academic institutions (many of which receive public funding), purchasing the drugs afterwards. If this is the case, the pharmaceutical company is not taking on the upfront investment risk. The amount of savings the negotiations will garner has also been called into question because a separate IRA provision caps out-of-pocket costs for enrollees to $2,000 beginning in 2026. This is projected to save 18.7 million enrollees $7.8 billion and could partially offset savings for the government from drug price negotiations. CBO estimates this subsidy could cost the government $2 billion through 2031. Another issue brought before lawmakers debating the IRA was drug launch prices. Proponents of lowering drug prices argued the bill did not address high launch prices, while others warned that the prospect of having to negotiate drug prices with HHS could lead to pharmaceutical companies pricing drugs higher at launch in response. Congress asked the CBO to analyze this possibility, and the CBO projected that drug companies will indeed raise launch prices, primarily in response to the inflation rebate provision, and mainly affect Medicaid and Medicare Part B. Drug makers had also told lawmakers that the IRA could de-incentivize companies from bringing generics to market. Generic drugs are made and sold only after the patent for a specific drug expires, and they become available at lower prices than their brand-name counterparts.

He was 80. “General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Party Nguyen Phu Trong passed away at 13:38 on July 19, 2024, at the 108 Central Military Hospital due to old age and serious illness,” the Nhan Dan newspaper said. Official media said a state funeral would be held. Trong had dominated Vietnamese politics since 2011, when he was elected party chief. During his tenure, he worked to consolidate the Communist Party’s power in Vietnam’s single-party political system. In the decade before he took the top role in Vietnamese politics, the balance of power had shifted more toward the governmental wing led by then-Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung. Born in 1944 in Hanoi, Trong was a Marxist-Leninist ideologue who earned a degree in philosophy before becoming a member of the Communist Party at the age of 22. He viewed corruption as the single gravest threat in maintaining the party’s legitimacy. “A country without discipline would be chaotic and unstable,” Trong said in 2016 after being reelected to the party’s helm. Officially, Vietnam has no top leader, but the Communist Party chief is traditionally seen as the most powerful. He launched a sweeping anti-corruption campaign known as the “blazing furnace” that singed both business and political elites. Since 2016, thousands of party officials have been disciplined. They included former presidents Nguyen Xuan Phuc and Vo Van Thuong and the former head of parliament, Vuong Dinh Hue. In all, eight members of the powerful Politburo were ousted on corruption allegations, compared to none between 1986 and 2016. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was “saddened” by Trong’s death and called him “a pivotal figure in Vietnam’s recent history,” U.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said. During Trong’s tenure as president and Communist Party chief, Guterres said, “Vietnam continued its remarkable development journey to emerge as one of the world’s fastest-growing economies and an important partner for the United Nations,” the spokesman said. Trong studied in the Soviet Union from 1981 to 1983, and there was speculation that under his leadership, Vietnam would move closer to Russia and China. However, the Southeast Asian nation followed a pragmatic policy of “bamboo diplomacy,” a phrase he coined that referred to the plant’s flexibility, bending but not breaking in the shifting headwinds of geopolitics. Vietnam maintained its traditional ties with its much larger neighbor, China, dispute differences over sovereignty in the South China Sea. But it also drew closer to the United States, elevating its ties with its former Vietnam War foe to its highest diplomatic status, a comprehensive strategic partnership. The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party offered its condolences to the Vietnamese people. It said that “Trong was a close comrade and sincere friends” of China’s ruling party and called him “a staunch Marxist and a great leader,” the state news agency Xinhua reported U.S. President Joe Biden issued a statement mourning Trong’s death. He called Trong “a champion of the deep ties between the American and Vietnamese people whose leadership helped nurture the friendship and partnership our countries enjoy today.” Trong’s legacy is mixed, with the unintended consequence of the anti-graft campaign being an erosion of institutions within the Communist Party, said Nguyen Khac Giang, a visiting fellow in the Vietnam Studies Program at Singapore’s ISEAS–Yusof Ishak Institute. The party institutions were the bedrock ensuring that a balance of power remained among its different factions, he said. “Vietnam has become more and more like China, where institutions and norms doesn’t really matter as much as personal power,” Giang said. Vietnamese President To Lam was appointed the party caretaker on July 18 while Trong received treatment for his ill health. As Vietnam’s top security official, Lam had led the anti-graft campaign until becoming president in May, when his predecessor resigned after being caught up in it. The party’s Politburo asked Lam to “preside over the work of the Party Central Committee, the Politburo, and the Secretariat,” according to a statement from its central office which was the first official confirmation of Trong’s poor health. Rumors about his health have swirled in Vietnamese politics since he was first hospitalized in 2019, and more recently when he appeared extremely frail while meeting visiting Russian President Vladmir Putin. Trong’ death leaves behind a yawning political vacuum in Vietnam. Although Lam is widely viewed as the likely next party chief, Giang predicted “a very uncertain time” in Vietnamese politics because the norms and institutions governing the country are “very shaky.” “Now it isn’t only about the rules or norms, but it is also about who holds the most power,” Giang said.","summary":"Trong had dominated Vietnamese politics since 2011, when he was elected party chief.

The polls, released Friday as part of a swath of Trafalgar Group battleground-state surveys, show the former president poised to win the 25 electoral votes at stake in November if current trends hold. In Wisconsin, home of the just-concluded Republican National Convention, Trump leads Biden 46% to 43% among the 1,087 registered voters polled, with 7% undecided and the remaining voters going to Robert Kennedy (3%), Jill Stein (1%) and Cornel West and Libertarian Chase Oliver, who are each closer to no support than even Stein’s meager 1%. The R+1.5 survey was conducted between July 15 and July 17, encompassing much of the RNC. It has a +/- 2.9% margin of error and accords with trends in Wisconsin polling since the sole debate between Trump and Biden in late June. As FiveThirtyEight’s tracking shows, Biden was slightly ahead until recently on average in Badger State surveys, but Trump’s current lead is 2.5%. Trafalgar’s Michigan survey of 1,091 registered voters was also conducted between Monday and Wednesday, and it’s also showing a close race but one where Trump is slightly ahead of Biden, 45% to 43% — a lead inside the margin of error of +/- 2.9% but aligned with the average lead of 2 points as tracked by FiveThirtyEight. Kennedy is somewhat more of a factor in the Great Lake State than in Wisconsin, garnering 4% support. Stein and West are at 1%, and 5% of voters say they are undecided. Biden has campaigned in Michigan fairly recently, holding a rally in Detroit where he reassured a deeply supportive invitation-only crowd he had no plans to leave the race. “You’ve probably noticed a lot of speculation lately. What’s Joe Biden going to do? Is he going to stay in the race? Is he going to drop out? Here’s my answer: I am running, and we’re going to win,” the president said last week. Biden continued along this vein, saying he’s “the nominee of this party because 14 million Democrats like you voted for me” during the primaries this year, a beauty-contest exercise without serious competition anywhere and with no competition at all in states like Florida, which excluded Biden’s opponents from ballot consideration. “You made me the nominee. No one else. Not the press, not the pundits, not the press, not the donors. You, the voters. You decided. No one else, and I’m not going anywhere,” the president promised. External pressure has only built on Biden since that rally, a fact acknowledged by some of Michigan’s leading Democrats. Sen. Gary Peters — Democratic Senate Campaign Committee chair — told CBS News he’d “been talking to the president’s campaign” and relaying “concerns” about the “very close race” and its downballot impacts. He shied away from offering further “specifics” about his “straightforward and candid assessment” but said the campaign “listened” to his critique in what was a “good, productive conversation.” Team Trump, meanwhile, is playing to win Michigan just like it did in 2016 — and holds a rally Saturday featuring the candidate and running-mate J.D. Vance in Grand Rapids. Biden campaign officials said as recently as last week the “clearest pathway” to 270 votes is through Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. But indications are that road is treacherously narrow right now, and the latest polling backs up the theory the re-election campaign is running out of time to fix its steering.","summary":"Fresh surveys from Wisconsin and Michigan show that in the wake of Saturday’s assassination attempt, Donald Trump is leading President Biden in two of three “blue wall” states.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/07/19/us-news/bidens-blue-wall-crumbles-as-trumps-ahead-in-two-crucial-midwestern-battleground-states-polls/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/85721772.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-19 23:38:51","author":"A.g.

At least three of those committee members have joined a growing chorus of Democratic officials urging President Joe Biden to end his re-election campaign with a warning that his Republican rival poses a “grave” threat, if elected. Congressman Adam Schiff warned in a statement this week that a “second Trump presidency will undermine the very foundation of our democracy, and I have serious concerns about whether the President can defeat Donald Trump in November.” In a recent four-page letter to Biden, congressman Jamie Raskin told the president that “everything we believe in is on the line in the next four-and-a-half months” and that “we have an overriding obligation to defeat the forces of resurgent monarchy and oppression.” “Everything else pales in comparison to this struggle,” he added. Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren said in a statement this week that, as a member of the January 6 committee, she knows “perhaps as well as anyone, how unsuitable Donald Trump is to be president.” “His policies are wrong. His character is unprincipled and corrupt. He remains as grave a threat to the Constitutional order and rule of law that he was on January 6, 2021 when he incited insurrection,” she wrote. “And, if he is elected President again, he will dismantle all that Democrats have achieved for the American people.” “I think from the data it’s pretty clear,” she told MSNBC on July 19, “that the president is on a trajectory to not prevailing in the election, and I think it’s telling that members of the January 6 committee — myself, Adam Schiff, Jamie Raskin — have all suggested that he step aside, and that we get another candidate who can beat Donald Trump.” The former president “is a threat to America and the world. He cannot be elected. He must not be elected,” she added. “This is [Biden’s] decision. But it’s not about him, it’s not about me. It’s about America.” Raskin told The Independent that he wrote the letter, dated July 9, on the Fourth of July weekend. “My point was that we needed a strategic internal discussion about how to move forward to decisively win the election, which is of immeasurable importance to the future of America,” he said in a statement to The Independent. “The letter expressed my profound affection for the president, my great concern for the future of the country and my confidence in the judgment he would make. None of those things has changed.” A months-long House select committee investigation into the events surrounding and leading up to the attack on the Capitol on January 6 included a series of blockbuster public hearings laying out evidence and witness testimony that described Trump’s attempts to remain in office at whatever cost. The panel’s final 845-page report provides a detailed account of Trump’s refusal to cede power — regardless of the outcome — while he privately acknowledged that he lost, even as the ongoing false narrative that the election was “stolen” from him was fueling the mob in the halls of Congress. The committee unanimously determined that Trump should be criminally charged for conspiracy and obstruction as well as inciting an insurrection. Independent Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith is separately prosecuting the former president for conspiracy and obstruction in a case that now faces roadblocks under the Supreme Court’s recent decision on presidential “immunity” for actions in office. The committee also led to the criminal prosecutions — and imprisonments — of Trump aides Peter Navarro and Steve Bannon, the first members of Trump’s inner circle to face criminal convictions for any crimes connected to Trump’s attempts to reverse his election loss. Both men were found in contempt of Congress after refusing subpoenas for their testimony to the committee. Last month, on his Truth Social, Trump called their convictions a “Total and Complete American Tragedy.” “INDICT THE UNSELECT J6 COMMITTEE,” he demanded. Trump and Republican officials have accused members of deleting evidence in the investigation, all of which is publicly available. “It has to stop, because, otherwise, we’re not going to have a country,” Trump said in an interview with Fox News last month. “Look, when this election is over, based on what they have done, I would have every right to go after them.” Bannon began his four-month prison sentence on July 1. Navarro ended his four-month sentence in a federal prison facility in Miami on July 17, and then hours later he stepped on the stage of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee to a hero’s welcome. “If they can come for me, and if they can come for Donald Trump,” Navarro said, “be careful. They will come for you.”","summary":"Trump wants to ‘indict’ them, and they’re now joining calls to warn Biden about the stakes of his potential loss","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-biden-january-6-adam-schiff-b2582844.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/07/19/21/2024-07-01T071158Z_1204227868_RC26M8AQS3A2_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-IMMUNITY.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/LdMfyH03-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-19 23:25:55","author":"Alex Woodward","authors":["Alex Woodward"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.148},{"id":252194496,"title":"Defiant Biden vows to stay despite Democrat revolt","text":"by Saul Loeb with Danny Kemp in WashingtonUS President Joe Biden pledged to stay in the White House race Friday, defying a growing Democratic party revolt that raised speculation he could bow out as soon as this weekend.\"The stakes are high, and the choice is clear.

More than 30 House Democrats and four senators have now called on him to drop out.A key donor, Silicon Valley investor Michael Moritz, also joined other supporters such as actor George Clooney who want Biden to make way.\"Sadly, President Biden has a choice -- vanity or virtue,\" the New York Times quoted Moritz as saying.With reports that top Democrats have also expressed concerns, polls showing Trump on course for a return to the Oval Office, and fundraising drying up, the walls appeared to be closing in.NBC News reported that some of Biden's family had \"discussed what an exit from his campaign might look like\" although there was no final decision to do so.Vice President Kamala Harris, the front-runner to succeed him as the Democratic presidential candidate if Biden does drop out, was holding an emergency call with donors on Friday.Biden's campaign however pushed back against reports that he would bow out, saying that while there had been some \"slippage\" in support, he was still the best candidate.\"Absolutely the president's in this race,\" campaign chairwoman Jen O'Malley Dillon told MSNBC's Morning Joe program. \"Joe Biden is more committed than ever to beat Donald Trump.\"Dark VisionBiden's statement blasted his rival's speech at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee on Thursday, saying that \"Donald Trump's dark vision for the future is not who we are as Americans.\"But the split-screen between the two campaigns has been stark, with Trump receiving a triumphant reception from newly unified Republicans after surviving an assassination attempt on Saturday.The pressure on Biden has soared in the last 48 hours, with reports that former president Barack Obama, ex-House speaker Nancy Pelosi and the party's congressional leaders had all expressed concerns behind the scenes.Top House Democrat Hakeem Jeffries was evasive on Friday, saying that the \"ticket that exists right now is the ticket we can win on\" but saying it was Biden's \"decision to make.\"The scene could now be set for the most crucial weekend of Biden's presidency, with media speculation that the US leader is using his time hunkered down in Rehoboth Beach to consult family members and mull over the path ahead.The NBC report said it could involve a \"carefully calculated plan\" to step aside based on his own timing, to give some dignity to what would be a historically late decision by a sitting US president not to run.Any decision by Biden to step aside less than four months from the election would also have to try to avoid chaos in the Democratic Party over his successor as nominee.Biden beat Trump in 2020, becoming the oldest president in US history in the process.

Both Trump and Zelenskyy shared details of the call on social media, saying the Ukrainian president congratulated Trump on becoming the GOP nominee and condemning Saturday's attempted assassination. Trump, who has insisted that the war between Russia and Ukraine \"would have never happened\" if he were still president, described it as a \"very good phone call.\" \"I appreciate President Zelenskyy for reaching out because I, as your next President of the United States, will bring peace to the world and end the war that has cost so many lives and devastated countless innocent families.

Zelenskyy said Ukraine was grateful for U.S. aid and that the two agreed to \"discuss at a personal meeting what steps can make peace fair and truly lasting.\" Trump has been critical of the Biden administration sending billions in aid to Ukraine to help it defend itself since Russia launched a full-scale invasion in February 2022. Trump has called Zelenskyy \"the greatest salesman of any politician that's ever lived.\" \"Every time he comes to our country, he walks away with $60 billion,\" Trump said on June 15. It's unclear if Trump would support continued military aid for Ukraine if he wins the election. His running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, has also been critical of Ukraine assistance. During a call between Trump and Zelenskyy on July 25, 2019, the then-president pushed for his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate his political rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter.

Sullivan spoke on Friday at the Aspen Security Forum in Colorado. Asked whether Washington was open to relaxing the “extreme limitations” on Ukraine’s use of US weapons, he would not rule anything out. “As the war has evolved, our support has evolved,” Sullivan said. “I can’t give a definitive answer to that question for the future.” The White House reportedly gave Kiev permission to use some of the American missiles to attack military targets across the border from Kharkov Region in late May. “Circumstances changed. Russia actually launched a new offensive directly across the border towards Kharkov, and common sense dictated that Ukraine had to be able to fire back against that offensive,” Sullivan explained. However, he added, President Joe Biden’s “policy on long-range strikes into Russia has not changed thus far.” Asked the same question earlier in the day, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said there is an “ongoing conversation” in Washington about relaxing the restrictions on Kiev, offering no more details. Vladimir Zelensky has slammed the Western limitations as “crazy,” claiming Ukraine should be able to strike anywhere in Russia. “We have allowed Zelensky to use American weapons in the near border regions of Russia. If he had the opportunity to strike Moscow, strike the Kremlin, would that make sense? No, it wouldn’t,” Biden said last week, at a press briefing in Washington. In late June, a US-supplied ATACMS missile dropped cluster munitions on a beach near Sevastopol in Crimea, killing at least four people, including two children, and injuring more than 150. Russia said it would hold the US directly responsible for the “premeditated terrorist” attack. President Vladimir Putin has described Ukrainian attacks inside Russian territory using Western-supplied weapons as “close to aggression.” He has also warned that Moscow might engage in an asymmetrical response, arming states or groups hostile to the US with advanced weaponry.","summary":"Washington’s policy on long-range attacks has not changed but might in the future, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan has said \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/601373-us-ukrainian-strikes-russia-evolve/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.07/article/669af28b20302709fe5b3dc7.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-19 23:17:49","author":null,"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.074},{"id":252194338,"title":"David Letterman will headline Biden fundraiser with Hawaii governor on July 29","text":"HONOLULU (AP) — David Letterman will headline a fundraiser with President Joe Biden in 10 days with Hawaii Gov. Josh Green, a sign that his campaign is forging ahead despite continued calls for the president to bow out of the 2024 race. The fundraiser on July 29 will be at the home of a family friend on Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts, Green told The Associated Press Friday. It will feature the longtime late-night host, plus Biden and first lady Jill Biden. The campaign has at least 10 other fundraising events over the last 10 days of July. Letterman helmed CBS’ “Late Show” for 22 seasons. The event comes as other celebrities like George Clooney, director Rob Reiner and Stephen King have called on Biden to drop out of the 2024 race, following his disastrous debate performance on June 27. There’s also been growing concern over continued fundraising support after anxious donors expressed serious worries about his performance and the future of the party. Biden insists he is the best person to beat Donald Trump and is not stepping away. On Friday, Biden, who is recovering from COVID-19 at his Rehoboth Beach home, called for party unity and sought to shift the focus back to Donald Trump’s agenda. He said he was looking forward to getting back on the campaign trail next week to challenge the Republican’s claims, “while making the case for my own record and the vision that I have for America: one where we save our democracy, protect our rights and freedoms, and create opportunity for everyone.” “The stakes are high, and the choice is clear,” he said. “Together, we will win.” Green is hosting the event as a growing number of lawmakers have expressed doubts over Biden’s candidacy. A person familiar with the plans initially told the AP the fundraiser would be at Green’s home, but Green later clarified that it belonged to a family friend. Green has known the Biden family for years — his wife’s uncle was Biden’s college roommate — and he said the decision whether or not to leave the race has to come from Biden himself. Green told the AP, “We support the President, the V.P. and the Democratic Party, in good and tough times because he has been there for us as a family and a state.” Green has been governor of Hawaii since 2022, managing the state through the devastating wildfires last summer.

Terms of the proposal were not disclosed. The agreement, covering 28,000 workers, faces a union ratification vote. The Association of Professional Flight Attendants previously rejected an American offer that would have increased pay immediately by 18% followed by annual 2% raises. The union was seeking 33% upfront, followed by four annual increases of 6% each. Flight attendants haven’t received raises since 2019. Union President Julie Hedrick said the deal “will put billions of additional dollars into compensation and work rules for our flight attendant workgroup. American, which is based in Fort Worth, Texas, said the deal “will provide immediate financial and quality-of-life improvements for American’s flight attendants. It’s a contract we’re proud of and one our flight attendants have earned.” Flight attendants voted last year to authorize a strike, and union leadership had raised the threat of a walkout this fall.

Dearborn, a small city near Detroit, Michigan, is home to America’s largest Arab American community. The mood amongst locals has significantly switched as the death toll in Gaza continues to mount – with little indication of a political solution in the near future. Residents of Dearborn believe America’s political leaders are playing a major role in enabling the suffering caused by ongoing conflict in the Middle East. Their apathy towards the upcoming election is dwindling by the day. Abu Bilal, owner of Oriental Fashion – a clothing store on Dearborn’s Warren Avenue, demanded to know ‘where is the humanity’ as he discussed the killings of 90 Palestinian civilians with The Guardian. A man getting his hair cut at the Al-Rehab Barber Shop on Dearborn’s Maple Street said – in Arabic – that he doesn’t care who becomes president following the November election. It won’t make any difference to him… His barber agreed, saying that he didn’t vote in 2020 and doesn’t plan to this year. Joe Biden won the battleground state in 2020 by just 154,000 votes – and the demise in political spirit could be harmful to his ability to take the key swing state come November. Election turnout in Dearborn was 10 percent higher in 2020 than the previous election in 2016 – Biden also won 10 percent more votes than Hillary did. These stats suggest that voters were energized in 2020, but word on the streets of Dearborn, per The Guardian, is that this year’s attitudes could not be more different. During the Democratic primaries in February, 6,432 Dearborn voters chose ‘uncommitted’ in protest of Biden’s support of Israel’s war. Biden held a campaign rally at a school near Dearborn on Friday – but Arab Americans across the country have rejected the campaign’s bid to win their votes. ‘The whole community was aware [that the administration had sent campaign officials to meet with the community], and I think it says a lot, that he sees us as no more than votes and that it’s been normalized for our people back home to be killed,’ Jenin Yaseen, an artist whose family is from a village outside Nablus in the occupied West Bank, said. ‘Dearborn is made up of people from Yemen, Iraq, Lebanon and elsewhere that have been directly impacted by American imperialism,’ she added. Members of Biden’s election campaign team visited Dearborn in January – and were met by an empty room on one occasion because Dearborn’s mayor, Abdullah Hammoud, refused to meet them. Hammoud, along with two other Arab American state representatives, refused the campaign meeting because its purpose was to discuss elections and not the war. The 33-year-old mayor was unimpressed with President Joe Biden’s ‘strange’ comments about an Israel-Hamas cease fire – which the president delivered while enjoying a scoop of ice cream with comedian Seth Meyers. Hammoud called out Biden in February, shortly before casting his vote for ‘uncommitted’ rather than the leader of his party at a Dearborn polling place. ‘I think I find it strange that you’re eating ice cream at a parlor – that is the moment that you talk about a cease fire coming forward,’ he told DailMail.com when asked about the president’s latest comments. He then referenced Benjamin Netanyahu’s statements about having a plan to invade Rafah inside Gaza. ‘I don’t look to lip service or words. I’m looking for action. You want a long lasting, permanent and just cease fire. ‘We don’t want a return to the status quo of occupation and apartheid, of bombardment, of besiegement, of devastation and destruction for the Palestinian people. And that means establishing a just Palestinian state,’ he said. In April, Muslim protesters were heard chanting ‘death to America’ and ‘death to Israel’ during a rally in Dearborn. Demonstrators gathered in the city in commemoration of Al-Quds Day in support of Palestinian people and to oppose Israel. The protest came less than a week after seven aid workers from World Central Kitchen were killed by an Israeli airstrike in Gaza, drawing global outrage. Video shared by the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI) shows Tarek Bazzi, a local activist, delivering remarks at a podium as chants of ‘death to America!’ sound in the background. ‘It’s not just Genocide Joe that has to go,’ Bazzi said in reference to President Biden. ‘It is the entire system that has to go. Any system that would allow such atrocities and such devilry to happen, and would support it – such a system does not deserve to exist on God’s Earth.’ Bazzi then directed his attention to Israel. ‘So when these fools ask us if Israel has the right to exist…the chant ‘death to Israel’ has become the most logical chant shouted across the world today,’ he said. Audience members then repeated the chant. Bazzi explained that the rallies have become ‘so anti-American’ because ‘it’s the United States government that provides the funds for all of the atrocities.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nA city labeled &#8216;America&#8217;s jihad capital&#8217; by the Wall Street Journal has&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: City dubbed &#8216;America&#8217;s capital of religious struggle&#8217; plunges into turmoil &#8211; as residents explain why they dislike both Biden and Trump before the election first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/city-dubbed-americas-capital-of-religious-struggle-plunges-into-turmoil-as-residents-explain-why-they-dislike-both-biden-and-trump-before-the-election/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/07/19/23/87555225-13653127-A_city_labeled_America_s_jihad_capital_by_the_Wall_Street_Journa-a-4_1721428415282.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-19 23:13:51","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.133},{"id":252194166,"title":"'The View' hosts erupt on anti-Trump Chris Christie refusing to back Biden: 'You cannot throw away your vote!'","text":"Former New Jersey Republican governor and longtime Trump critic Chris Christie faced backlash from co-hosts of \"The View\" after declaring that he would not vote for either former President Donald Trump or President Joe Biden.

Former President Donald Trump spoke about the July 13 assassination attempt on him in a speech that delegates said showed his humanity. “This is the most regenerating feeling,” said delegate Peter Kopsaftis, Barrington Township Republican committeeman after Trump’s acceptance speech Thursday. “We all have to work for one common goal — the American dream.” Joliet resident and at-large delegate Jay Bergman said there was an “overwhelming enthusiasm and optimism” on the convention floor noting many believed Trump was divinely protected during the shooting. “I have the feeling that the presidency is Trump’s to lose,” Bergman said. The main criticism from some Republicans? The 93-minute speech went too long. “Sixty minutes would’ve been enough,” Bergman said. Trump’s speech appealed to working-class families concerned about the increasing cost of living, delegates added. “The speech was really about the future and providing hope for people,” delegate and former Aurora alderman Rick Lawrence said. Delegate Joe Folisi said he found Trump’s presentation was subdued. “It wasn’t like a rally speech,” said Folisi, a Schaumburg Township Republican committeeman. “I think the shooting really changed it. He really moved the country forward. He did a great job.” The convention also highlighted the party’s efforts to reach out to a wider variety of voters, some delegates said. “I really liked … the way (Trump) and the convention appealed to so many different parts of America, so many different people from all these different walks of life,” outgoing Illinois GOP Chair Don Tracy said Friday. Tracy and others noted the platform’s revised stance on abortion — switching from an all-out ban to saying abortion laws should be left to the states — could help in suburban areas that have, in recent years, favored Democratic candidates. “The platform lays out the Trump agenda in a way that is more well-received in the suburbs,” Tracy said. “And if Trump does better in the suburbs that bodes well for down-ballot races.” Trump’s speech Thursday also offered a stark contrast to President Joe Biden and a Democratic Party struggling to figure out a path to victory in November, delegates said. “This is a well-organized, effective campaign that’s disciplined and on message,” said Richard Porter, a Winnetka resident and Illinois Republican national committeeman. Others agreed. “At this point in time in this country we need an individual that has the ability and is serious about addressing the problems that we face,” Lawrence said.","summary":"Suburban GOP delegates on Friday headed back home from the Republican National Convention, saying they felt energized and hopeful for the November election.","url":"https://www.dailyherald.com/20240719/news/suburban-republicans-leave-convention-energized-and-hopeful-for-november/","image":"https://imengine.public.prod.pdh.navigacloud.com/?uuid=b400f297-2c84-5d4f-8a61-9d4b8fb801db&function=fit&type=preview","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-19 23:11:33","author":"Alicia Fabbre","authors":["Alicia Fabbre"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.134},{"id":252193826,"title":"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez knocks Democratic colleagues for privately raising concerns about Biden: ‘That’s Bulls–t!’","text":"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) gave an impassioned defense Thursday of President Biden’s electoral prospects against former President Donald Trump — slamming Democratic lawmakers for privately raising concerns about his candidacy and accusing them of underestimating him. “What I see right now, and I want you all to know, is that over the last several weeks, there have been lots of Democrats who have been giving little anonymous quotes to the press,” the New York Democrat said in a nearly one hour-long Instagram Live post. “I’m not here to knock the press on it, I’m here to knock my colleagues on it. Because to me, I think that’s and I’m sorry — I’m going to say it because it’s after midnight — that’s bulls–t,” Ocasio-Cortez argued. She clarified that her frustration wasn’t with those “who have made a public statement and put their name on it.” “I’m talking about people who are too scared to say what they want to say in public, but somehow not afraid to say what they want to say to a journalist so long as they promise not to use their name,” she said. “That’s a bunch of horsesh*t!” she fumed. The 14th District representative went on to defend keeping Biden, 81, at the top of the Democratic ticket despite his disastrous debate performance against Trump, 78, floundering polling numbers and apparent mental decline. “People underestimate Biden’s performance. I think that is how he became president, is through a lot of people underestimating his performance with demographics that are not traditionally valued,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “And I think that people see where he’s weak. They don’t often see where he’s strong and just electorally, purely electorally.” “Joe Biden kind of like stomps with older people, like electorally, which is one of the strongest and most consistent electorates, and it’s actually a hard electorate for Democrats to win,” she explained. “You know, those are not people that are on Twitter, but they vote more consistently than almost any other bracket.” The congresswoman also suggested that Republicans could raise legal challenges related to ballot access if Biden were to be replaced so late in the process. Ocasio-Cortez further warned that Democrats are unlikely to unite around Vice President Kamala Harris if Biden were to drop out of the race. “If you think that there is consensus among the people who want Joe Biden to leave that Kamala, that they will support Kamala, Vice President Harris, you would be mistaken,” she said. “A lot of them are not just interested in removing the president. They are interested in removing the whole ticket.” “I’m here to tell you that a huge amount of the donor class, and a huge amount of these elites, and a huge amount of these folks in these rooms that I see that are pushing for President Biden to not be the nominee, also are not interested in seeing the vice president being the nominee,” the congresswoman claimed. “Will they win out on that? I don’t know. But I am here to tell you, do not take that for granted,” Ocasio-Cortez added. Three Democratic senators and more than two dozen House Democrats have called on Biden to end his re-election bid.","summary":"Ocasio-Cortez warned that Democrats are unlikely to unite around Vice President Kamala Harris if Biden were to drop out of the race. ","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/07/19/us-news/aoc-knocks-democratic-colleagues-for-privately-raising-concerns-about-biden-thats-bulls-t/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/85719717.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/BVj7NClu-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-19 23:10:28","author":"Victor Nava","authors":["Victor Nava"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.253},{"id":252194224,"title":"Potential Reasons for Biden to Withdraw from 2024 Presidential Race and the Outcome","text":"PRESIDENT Joe Biden has repeatedly declared his intention to compete in the 2024 election — except for in a few very specific situations. 1 The 81-year-old appeared at times lost and misspoke multiple times during the event, which was the first of two scheduled debates in the run-up to November’s election. His performance left many voters disconcerted with the Democratic presidential nominee and led to a new and more intense call among some voters and leaders in his own party to reconsider his candidacy. Biden’s fitness for office was again questioned when the White House announced that the President — the oldest in American history — contracted COVID-19 for at least the second time and would need to take time off the campaign trail to self-isolate at his home in Delaware. While many are questioning whether the President is vital enough to compete in the election or govern the country for another two years, his rival has been promoting an image of vitality and strength in contrast. Even after the former President survived a shocking assassination attempt at a rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday, the felon went on days later to clinch the Republican presidential nomination and deliver an energetic speech to thousands of viewers — in stark contrast to many people’s image of Biden. The number of Democrats who have publically called for the President to call it quits before the Democratic National Convention in early August has continued to grow in the weeks since the televised debate. Senator Adam Schiff of California, well known for his role in the hearings that led to Trump’s first impeachment in 2019, may be the highest-profile Democrat to call for the President to drop out of the race yet. Rumors that President Barack Obama and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi have encouraged Biden to step down have also been reported. At least 20 party leaders have publically asked the President to step aside at the time of writing. But Biden has repeatedly stated that he has no intention of giving up the Democratic nomination — unless a couple of unlikely circumstances occur. The President has publically acknowledged four different reasons he could be convinced to not seek another term in the White House, according to Fortune. DIVINE INTERVENTION He first admitted that there was at least one situation that could drive him off November’s ticket during an interview on ABC News a few days after the first debate. Biden initially doubled down on his intention to stay in the race before admitting to a special case that could change his mind. “I have convinced myself of two things,” Biden said. “I’m the most qualified person to beat him, and I know how to get things done.” “If you can be convinced that you cannot defeat Donald Trump, will you stand down?” journalist George Stephanopoulos countered. “It depends,” Biden responded. “I mean, if the Lord Almighty comes out and tells me that, I might do that.” UNBEATABLE NUMBERS Beyond a sign from above, Biden offered another reason why he might be willing to step aside during a news conference for last week’s NATO summit in Washington. After refuting multiple questions about hypothetical scenarios that could lead to him leaving the White House, Biden offered a new situation. He would not withdraw “unless [pollsters] came back and said, ‘There’s no way you can win,” he said. Biden was then asked specifically what he would do if Vice President Kamala Harris were to begin polling significantly better than him. “No one is saying that. No poll says that,” he replied defiantly. A TRAGIC ACCIDENT During an interview on a Detroit radio station last week, the President admitted to another scenario that could see him forgo the party nomination. “We will 1,000% — in your words — see you on the ballot this November?” host Speedy Morman asked Trump. “Unless I get hit by a train, yeah,” Biden responded with a tinge of irony. “Let’s hope that doesn’t happen, for your safety’s concern,” the host replied. UNKNOWN MEDICAL PROBLEMS Most recently, the President pointed out another and less hypothetical situation that could push him out of the Oval Office. He shared the possibility in a yet-to-be-aired interview with BET journalist Ed Gordon earlier this week. The President might drop out “if I had some medical condition that emerged,” Biden told Gordon. “If doctors came to me and said, ‘You got this problem, that problem.’” UNKNOWN TERRITORY Those urging Biden to step aside are hoping that the President will make the decision before the Democratic National Convention, gearing up to begin on August 19. A presidential candidate for one of the major political parties has not dropped out of the race so late in election season in recent American history. Because of the unprecedented situation, it is hard to tell what will happen if Biden calls it quits. The only certainty is that the processes of replacing Biden on the ticket would be markedly different before he is officially nominated at the DNC and after. If he opts out before the DNC delegates cast their votes in a virtual roll call scheduled for early August, the delegates could cast their ballots for another candidate until a single winner receives a majority. If Biden were to resign, die, or become incapacitated after the DNC concludes on August 22, the path forward is much murkier. The Democratic National Committee chair, Jaime Harrison, would be tasked with negotiating with top congressional Democrats and the Democratic Governors Association to find a replacement, according to CNBC. Harrison would then deliver the group’s pick to the Committee, which could officially fill the vacancy, per party rules.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nPRESIDENT Joe Biden has repeatedly declared his intention to compete in the&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Potential Reasons for Biden to Withdraw from 2024 Presidential Race and the Outcome first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/potential-reasons-for-biden-to-withdraw-from-2024-presidential-race-and-the-outcome/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Four-reasons-Biden-would-use-to-drop-out-of-2024.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-19 23:08:18","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.335},{"id":252193780,"title":"Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Senator, suggests Biden should not run for the 2024 election","text":"Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio called on President Joe Biden to end his re-election campaign Friday, becoming the fourth Democrat in the chamber to ask Biden to drop out of the race. “Over the last few weeks, I’ve heard from Ohioans on important issues, such as how to continue to grow jobs in our state, give law enforcement the resources to crack down on fentanyl, protect Social Security and Medicare from cuts, and prevent the ongoing efforts to impose a national abortion ban,” Brown said in a written statement shared first with NBC News. “These are the issues Ohioans care about and it is my job to keep fighting for them.” “I agree with the many Ohioans who have reached out to me,” Brown added. “At this critical time, our full attention must return to these important issues. I think the President should end his campaign.” Brown’s call follows one Thursday from Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., who, like Brown, faces a tough re-election campaign this fall, and another Friday from Sen. Martin Heinrich, D-N.M. Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., urged Biden to withdraw from the race last week. More than 30 congressional Democrats now want someone other than Biden to be their party’s presidential nominee. The push for Biden to exit comes after a debate performance with Trump last month that raised alarms about the president’s age and health — and about his ability to lead the Democratic ticket this fall. The push has intensified in recent days, with speculation increasing about Vice President Kamala Harris and others stepping in for Biden. Brown, according to his campaign, will not weigh in on the process to choose a new Democratic nominee and believes Biden should serve the rest of his term. The three-term Ohio senator had previously said that voters in his state, which former President Donald Trump twice won by 8 percentage points, had “legitimate questions about whether the president should continue his campaign” and that he intended to listen to their concerns.

Trump’s account of the attempt on his life one week ago was honest, poignant and unforgettable. His successful efforts at unifying his party and his promise to unify the country reverberated far beyond the Milwaukee convention center. Just a few hours earlier another contender for the Presidency was addressing another hall full of supporters. With Joe Biden absent due to COVID, and almost certain to be about to be pushed out of the race by his own demoralized party, Kamala Harris is stepping things up a notch. On Thursday afternoon she addressed supporters at Westover High School in North Carolina. Never mind the world watching — it’s not clear that all the people at Westover High school were watching. So how did she do? In a word: terribly. From the moment she bounded onto the stage Harris reminded people of why this November’s election is Trump’s for the losing. First came the fake-hysteria of finding herself on a stage in front of all these people. The almost-hyperventilating note Kamala hits when she wants to sound as if she is really excited about something. She started by saying how great it was to be “with so many incredible leaders” in Fayetville. Her smile was so broad you worried her face would run out of space. She thanked the nation’s servicemen and their families. “I know their families serve with equal dedication,” she said, “and I thank you also.” This last part was done in the vocal register you might employ if addressing a nursery school. Next she chose to patronize Donald Trump´s running-mate, JD Vance. She described his personal life story (related the night before at the Republican convention) as “compelling.” And good for JD Vance for living a life that has caught the interest of the great Kamala. She went on to insist that the thing that was interesting about Vance was not what he had talked about but what he had not talked about. She went on to say that it was interesting that Vance had not talked about “Project 2025.” For anyone who does not get Democratic Party briefing notes, Project 2025 is a project of a conservative think-tank in Washington. In recent weeks the Democrats in Congress and Senate and on the Presidential ticket seem to have decided that Project 2025 is to be this year’s bogey-man. Kamala shook her head as she warned that it is “a 900-page blueprint.” This alone elicited boos from some of the audience. Presumably from people who just hate 900-page blueprints. The Democrats currently seem to imagine that if they just say “Project 2025” everyone will recoil in fear. In fact the project already joins a long list of conservative projects which are famous only on the political left. The Democrats hope that saying the words will have the same effect as saying “Voldemort” to a child at Hogwarts. Soon Kamala was saying “Here’s the thing.” Which is always a prelude to her missing the point. “If you claim to stand for unity you need to do more than just use the word.” She said this with a huge, knowing smirk on her face. It was the smirk of someone who seems to believe that they are in the process of dissing something to death. In fact I doubt whether anyone beyond Kamala and her speech-writers think that line is a zinger. And then came one of those strange accent-shifts. Lots of people shift their speaking style to adapt to their audiences. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez sometimes pretends she is black. Hillary Clinton sometimes used to pretend she had been raised in the south. And Joe Biden sometimes tries to pretend he hasn’t forgotten what he was saying. But even in such company Kamala’s voice-shifts are bizarre. After attacking Trump and Vance’s calls for unity she suddenly burst out with an attack of Southern: “We too busy watchin’ what you doin’ to hear what you’re sayin’,” she said. Truly the cringe was great with this one. For her part Kamala looked like she thought her southern-voice had gone down a storm in North Carolina. If she does make it to the presidency in November then I will await with keen interest her first world tour. Will she put on a French accent in France? Or a Chinese accent in China? I can’t wait to see what she does in Africa. The speech built to what could have been a climax when she said that her Republican opponents would take away all the money and rights of the people in North Carolina. By contrast she and Joe had stood up to “Big pharma, the big banks and big corporations.” She might as well have added “And Bigfoot.” What is more they had canceled debt, “including student loan debt.” As a whoop went up she once again forgot where she was. As if she was a southern preacher she suddenly said, “Testify if you have received it.” A few lesbian dance majors in the audience promptly hollered with gratitude. “Trump wants to roll back our progress,” she insisted. Once again hitting that Democrat note so memorably hit by George Clooney. Then “Check this out” she said, unpromisingly. The Republican party has recently held fundraisers “with big oil lobbyists.” “Ultimately,” she concluded, “in this election we each face a question. The question we face is what kind of country do we want to live in. Do we want to live in a country of freedom, compassion and rule of law? Or a country of chaos, fear and hate.” Most of the crowd signaled that they were more in favor of freedom than hate and preferred compassion to chaos. With the look of one who had done a job well Kamala grinned her way off the stage. Well, as Kamala might say, “check this out.” If the Democrats have any desire to win in November Kamala cannot be anywhere near the top of the ticket. If the Republicans want to win then they should pray that is exactly where she is.","summary":"On Thursday night, from the convention in Milwaukee, President Trump held the attention of the world.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/07/19/opinion/kamala-harris-proves-again-shes-not-a-better-candidate-than-biden/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/KAM124.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-19 23:03:24","author":"Douglas Murray","authors":["Douglas Murray"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.06},{"id":252194758,"title":"Bernie Sanders brings Stephen Colbert the perfect campaign message","text":"Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders went on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” early Friday to talk about the disastrously boring Republican National Convention. “I’ll tell you what nobody else will tell you,” Sanders told the host. “Why not? It's two in the morning, who's listening anyhow?” While Sanders was indeed funny, he was also dead serious about how important the choice in November is for all working Americans. When it came to Donald Trump’s tortuously long speech, Sanders said, \"You know what stuns me about these things, Stephen, is how little the real problems of the country are discussed, and how few real solutions are given.” “Basically, what the speech was ‘The country is in terrible shape. Vote for me. And I'm going to bring wonderful things to all of you. You don't know how, why, I'm going to do it. Just trust me.\" Sanders went on to say that the GOP’s catastrophic climate change denialism alone should disqualify anyone voting for their candidates—one in particular. \"Nobody in America should be voting for Trump,” the two-time presidential candidate declared, noting that Trump and the Republican Party’s number one policy is cutting taxes for the wealthiest billionaires. Everyone else is screwed. “90% of Republicans want to cut Social Security in one way or another,” Sanders pointed out. “So anyone who has any illusion that Republicans will do anything to benefit the working class of this country is sorely mistaken.\" Colbert asked Sanders his thoughts on the world's most expensive mid-life crisis—Elon Musk promising to pour about $180 million into Republican campaign coffers. \"In a sense, we should thank Musk for making this issue so obvious,” Sanders said. “What we have in America now is a corrupt political system. That's all. We do not really live in a democracy. You live in a semi-democracy. You have the right to vote. But a billionaire out there has the right to contribute hundreds of millions of dollars to further his or her aims. And what Musk has done, and other billionaires are doing, is falling into line behind Trump because they know they're going to get massive tax breaks.\" Sanders has shown his support for President Joe Biden during the chaos following the latter’s terrible debate showing on June 27. The senator also wrote an op-ed in The New York Times on Saturday, insisting that Biden was the best candidate to face Trump in November. He reiterated that support to Colbert. “Let me be very clear as to why I support the president. Because I think of all of the candidates out there, I am more than aware of the disastrous debate that he had, and the problems that he has. But I am also aware that he has been the strongest, most progressive president in my lifetime. He is the first president in American history to stand with workers on a picket line. He has taken on pharma and lowered the cost of prescription drugs. We are now rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure. We've put more money into climate change than any time in the history of this country. Five million Americans have gotten student debt relief, and that's for a start.\" True. True. True. True. But maybe most importantly was Sanders’ final message—the reason why we must keep getting out the vote. “Over the last many decades, Stephen, we should be proud as a nation. We have come a long way in erasing bigotry for our African American brothers and sisters. We've come a long way in fighting sexism and fighting homophobia. Now our job is the economic struggle and to tell the billionaire class, and their greed, they can no longer think they're going to get it all. This country belongs to all of us.\" Regardless of whether Biden stays in the race, the message Sanders delivered applies: \"Nobody in America should be voting for Trump.\" And it’s one we should all amplify.

As you know, I have been skeptical of most reporting on the subject. But last week forced me to reconsider that skepticism. That’s when former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Joe Biden needs to make a decision. She said this after he had already made it. Since then, she and other big-wheel Democrats, including Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer, have argued to Biden that if he stays in the running, he risks bringing down congressional Democrats down the ballot, in addition to paving the way for Donald Trump’s victory. This morning came with the most explicit suggestion yet that Biden is thinking about dropping out. The Post, along with others, reported that Pelosi has told some House Democrats “she believes President Biden can be persuaded fairly soon to exit the presidential race amid serious doubts he can win in November.” “She thinks Biden is getting close to deciding to abandon his presidential bid,” the Post reported. Pelosi is the 21st century’s greatest House speaker. Her clout among Democrats, not just in the US Congress, is pretty much unlimited. If she’s letting it be known that she thinks Biden “can be persuaded fairly soon” to exit or that he “is getting close to deciding to abandon his presidential bid,” it’s probably true. It would be foolish to doubt it. Will it happen? Jesus God, I hope not. Biden is still the best hope of defeating Trump and preventing an authoritarian takeover of the United States government. He’s the incumbent. His achievements are many and great. Social and economic indicators, like crime rates, which are down, and wages, which are up, are moving in the right direction. He has the backing of his party. (Yes, even those, like California Congressman Adam Schiff, who have called on him to drop out.) And the anti-maga majority is still out there for the taking. His campaign continues to say he’s in it to win it, and to God’s hoary ear, I hope that’s correct. But until the convention, I think we should think about how Pelosi and others have been making their case. We know why. The how is just as important, though. The likelihood of victory for Donald Trump will skyrocket the moment the Democratic incumbent leaves, if he leaves. The debate was a disaster. Lots of people recoiled in horror at the sight of an old man on stage. But the stakes are too high. If he leaves, it better be for reasons beyond vibes. Here, the Post’s report is helpful. It said Pelosi gathered evidence to support the contention that the president should leave. In talks with Democratic congresspeople, Pelosi was shown private polling data about their races. This “informed Pelosi’s thinking as she maneuvers through the sensitive discussions with Biden and his inner circle.” Pelosi then used that evidence to challenge Biden. In a recent discussion with the president, according to the Post and other news outlets, “Pelosi rejected the president’s assertion that he was doing fine in the polls. She asked him to bring a senior adviser into the talk so they could compare in detail their divergent internal polling.” A word about polling. First, private polling is better than public polling. The former is high-quality, expensive and necessary for making campaign decisions. The latter is what you and I have access to by reading the news. Second, public polling about the presidential election has been “in the ballpark” of private polling commissioned by Biden’s reelection campaign, according to Ron Klain, a close advisor. It may seem like Pelosi is making a convincing data-driven case to drop out. But that’s not as convincing as it seems. If public polling is “in the ballpark” of being right, that means Biden is probably one polling error away from winning, according to The Economist’s data editor. When Biden said he’s doing fine in the polls, that’s not denial. Despite a disastrous debate, despite endless myopia from the press corps, despite slippage among Democrats, the election is still a dead heat. You can say Biden should step aside because polls are showing he should. But polls are not monolithic. You can find one to support pretty much whatever argument you want. So the question isn’t whether Pelosi is making a data-driven case. It’s what data she’s using to make it. Given the enormity of the stakes, I don’t think it’s enough for even the 21st century’s greatest House speaker to say, “trust me. It’s real bad.” If you’re going to ask the most transformational president of our lifetimes to step aside, base it on something more than a guess. I’m not the first to say that if the damage from the disaster debate is as terrible as Biden’s critics say it is, there would be internal campaign polling that would tell us exactly that – and that someone somewhere would leak it when the time was right. But if Ron Klain is correct in saying that public polling and private polling are “in the ballpark” of each other, that’s why we haven’t seen leaks from anyone anywhere. Polling data, as close to sacred as anything in politics, isn’t showing a clear picture of what to do. You can say Biden should stay the course or you could say he should exit. That’s why we will probably never see it. We will hear about it, as we did in the Post report. But ultimately, if Biden leaves, it will not be for reasons beyond vibes. It will be vibes.","summary":"It pains me to say it looks like the president is thinking about dropping out of the race. As you know, I have been skeptical of most reporting on the subject.

Immigrant advocates kept the issue alive this week by filing notice to the state Supreme Court that they will appeal the judge’s ruling. A Maricopa County Superior Court judge on July 12 rejected an effort by the advocates to keep the proposed initiative off the ballot. The advocates argue that the measure breaks the rules because it deals with more than a single subject. Attorney Andy Gaona, who represents some of the groups, said Friday he was working on legal briefs in the cased that were due later in the day. The Legislature will have until July 26 to respond, he said. “We do think that single subject provision was violated,” Gaona said. “We hope that the court agrees.” Supporters of the initiative argue that it deals with a single subject: the border. The GOP-controlled Legislative in early June voted to allow to proposal to be placed on the ballot, asking voters if local law enforcement should be allowed to arrest migrants who cross illegally from Mexico into Arizona between ports of entry. The measure would also give state judges the power to order people convicted of the offense to return to their countries of origin. It is similar to a Texas law that has been put on hold by a federal appeals court while it is being challenged. Unlike the Texas law, Arizona’s proposal would also make it a felony punishable by 10 years of imprisonment for selling fentanyl that leads to a person’s death. Also included is a requirement that some government agencies use a federal database to verify a noncitizen’s eligibility for benefits. The Republican-backed proposal bypasses Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs, who had vetoed a similar measure in early March and has denounced the effort to bring the issue to voters. Supporters of the bill said it was necessary to ensure security along the state’s southern border, and that Arizona voters should be given the opportunity to decide the issue themselves. Opponents say the legislation would lead to racial profiling and create several millions of dollars in additional policing costs that Arizona cities, counties and the state can ill afford. The measure would go before voters in a state expected to play a crucial role in determining which party controls the White House and the U.S. Senate — likely razor-close races in Arizona. Republicans hope it will focus attention on the border, which they accuse Biden of mishandling, and dilute the political benefits Democrats seek from an abortion-rights initiative. Disorder on the border is a top motivator for many Republican voters who former President Donald Trump hopes will vote in big numbers. President Joe Biden in early June unveiled plans to restrict the number of migrants seeking asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border. This isn’t the first time Republican lawmakers in Arizona have tried to criminalize migration. When passing a much-debated 2010 immigration bill, the Arizona Legislature considered expanding the state’s trespassing law to criminalize the presence of immigrants and impose criminal penalties. But the trespassing language was removed and replaced with a requirement that officers, while enforcing other laws, question people’s immigration status if they were believed to be in the country illegally. The questioning requirement was ultimately upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court despite the racial profiling concerns of critics. But courts barred enforcement of other sections of the law.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nPHOENIX – The fight to keep a proposed border initiative off Arizona’s&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Ongoing Legal Battle for Arizona Immigration Initiative on Nov. 5 Ballot Sparks Appeals first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/ongoing-legal-battle-for-arizona-immigration-initiative-on-nov-5-ballot-sparks-appeals/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/rewrite-this-title-Legal-fight-continues-with-appeals-over-proposed.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-19 22:51:51","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.335},{"id":252194172,"title":"U.S. says Iran moving forward on a key aspect of developing a nuclear bomb","text":"CTVNews.ca Top Stories The CrowdStrike outage is affecting heath-care services in Canada.

Newsweek recently reported that in Florida, the election may start to shift in President Joe Biden's favor, who now enjoys a plurality of women voters' support in the Sunshine State. A FOX 13/Insider Advantage poll of 800 Floridians between July 15 and July 16 found that 47% of female respondents preferred Biden, while 44% preferred Trump. Trump's lead in Florida with male voters, however, remains significant: He leads Biden by a 57-38 margin among men. Still, on women on average have outpaced men in voter turnout among almost every racial demographic, meaning women could narrowly decide who wins Florida's 30 electoral votes in November. READ MORE: FL law enforcement chief sues DeSantis, says he was forced out for refusing to break the law The poll of Florida voters also found that Biden is the strongest candidate to face Trump in November. While some Democrats are pushing him to pull out of the race, the likeliest option to replace him at the top of the ticket is Vice President Kamala Harris. That poll found that Trump's slight lead over Biden with Florida voters grows to double digits if Harris is instead the nominee. Trump also regains the lead with women voters if Harris is on the ballot instead of Biden. Despite Florida having a Republican-dominated legislature, and electing far-right Republican Governor Ron DeSantis to two terms, the Sunshine State remains competitive in federal elections. In 2020, Biden won Florida's female voters over, with 51% to Trump's 48%. Trump won with male voters by a 54-45 margin, and carried the state with a three-point advantage. However, 2024 may be an even tighter race in Florida given that voters will have the opportunity to cast a ballot on abortion rights. So far, abortion rights have succeeded in every state ballot question since the Supreme Court overturned the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision in 2022. Abortion was even a winning issue in ruby-red states like Kansas, Kentucky and Montana in the 2022 midterms, and won another major victory in Ohio last year. READ MORE: Here's why no RNC speakers are mentioning of the GOP's biggest wins of the century Should Floridians turn out in large numbers for the abortion ballot initiative, it's likely that women will lead the charge given they'll be able to have a direct say in their own reproductive rights. This could influence not only the presidential race, but also a very competitive U.S. Senate race. Rep. Debbie Murcasel-Powell (D-Florida) is within striking distance of Sen. Rick Scott (R-Florida) in the latest polls from June, trailing him by just two points last month. The GOP likely knows its weak spot with women voters when it comes to abortion rights, as no speakers at the recent Republican National Convention once mentioned abortion during the four-day event. A Pew Research survey from May additionally found that nearly two-thirds of both men and women believe the procedure should be legal in most cases. Click here to read Newsweek's full report.

The songwriter says he didn’t want it played","text":"As Donald Trump wound down his rambling 93-minute speech on Thursday night to close out the 2024 Republican National Convention, the five-piece house band launched into Sam & Dave’s 1966 hit, “Hold On, I’m Coming.” The track has become a pneumonic device of sorts for the MAGA movement, playing Trump on- or offstage at rallies in a sonic ritual his followers have come to expect. But while Trump’s base seems to deeply enjoy this bit of theater, David Porter, a 2005 Songwriters Hall of Fame inductee who co-wrote “Hold On, I’m Coming” with late R&B icon, Isaac Hayes, said on Friday that he was never asked for permission to use his music and does not appreciate the ongoing association with the twice-impeached former president. “I can say [that] I don’t want any of my songs used for political campaigns,” Grammy-nominated Porter, 82, told The Independent. “Certainly including this one… We create music for uplifting people, not separating them.” Less than a week after Trump’s ear was bloodied in an assassination attempt, the GOP presidential nominee delivered the final RNC address in Milwaukee that started off striking a relatively moderate tone. A seemingly introspective Trump spoke of uniting the country, and serving all Americans rather than just his supporters. However, Trump soon went off-script, attacking the former Democratic House Speaker as “Crazy Nancy Pelosi,” mocking Joe Biden as the “worst” president in U.S. history, and serving up robust helpings of transphobic and anti-immigrant fodder the RNC delegates lapped up with glee. Trump’s well-known penchant for indulging the ugliest of impulses has led numerous artists to protest his usage of their music. Creedence Clearwater Revival frontman, John Fogerty, in 2020 served the Trump campaign with a cease-and-desist letter upon discovering the band’s “Fortunate Son” was providing a soundtrack for his public appearances. Similar objections have been lodged by, among others, Bruce Springsteen, Phil Collins, Neil Young, Adele, Rihanna, Pharrell Williams, R.E.M., Guns n’ Roses, Elton John, the Rolling Stones, and the estates of Tom Petty, Leonard Cohen, Prince, and Sinead O’Connor. In March, representatives for O’Connor’s estate and Chrysalis Records issued a statement expressing “outrage” upon learning that Trump had been playing her beloved performance of “Nothing Compares 2 U,” which was written by Prince, at his political rallies. \"It is no exaggeration to say that Sinéad would have been disgusted, hurt, and insulted to have her work misrepresented in this way by someone who she herself referred to as a ‘biblical devil,’” the statement said. “As the guardians of her legacy, we demand that Donald Trump and his associates desist from using her music immediately.” The laws surrounding song publishing and performance rights are complex; “willful” use over a copyright-holder’s objections can result in fines of up to $150,000 per occurrence. Shortly before Trump took the stage at the RNC on Thursday, his personal attorney Alina Habba relayed a story to the crowd about Trump’s “love” for music, and recalled the day “a few years ago, [when] he wanted me to hear a new song he had selected for an upcoming rally.” “I could hear it blaring in the background at Mar-a-Lago,” Habba went on. “He landed on a song called ‘Hold on, I’m Coming.’” That Trump continues to use the song is especially galling to Porter, as well as Hayes’ family, in light of the fact that they first raised their objections more than two years ago. “The estate and family of Isaac Hayes DID NOT approve and would NEVER approve the use of ‘Hold on I’m coming’ by Sam and Dave by Donald Trump at this weekend’s National Rifle Association convention,” a spokesperson for the Hayes estate told Variety in May 2022. “Our condolences go out to the victims and families of #Uvalde and mass shooting victims everywhere.” Hayes’ daughter Veronica, who was unable to be reached on Friday, told a local Memphis TV station at the time: “My father’s legacy was very clean and wasn’t tainted by anything. Since we are the survivors, we get to choose how his music is played and who’s allowed to use it.” “Hell to the No!” Porter posted about it on his now-defunct Twitter account. “I did Not and would NOT approve of them using the song for any of his purposes!” Atlantic Records now owns the rights to “Hold On, I’m Coming,” and told K8 News at the time that it had no plans to pursue legal action.","summary":"‘We create music for uplifting people, not separating them,’ David Porter, who co-wrote the iconic track with R&B legend Isaac Hayes, told The Independent","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-rnc-speech-songs-b2582857.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/07/19/03/11486627.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-19 22:48:59","author":"Justin Rohrlich","authors":["Justin Rohrlich"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.258},{"id":252193442,"title":"Legal fight continues with appeals over proposed immigration initiative for Arizona Nov. 5 ballot","text":"PHOENIX (AP) — The fight to keep a proposed border initiative off Arizona’s Nov. 5 ballot is not over yet. Immigrant advocates kept the issue alive this week by filing notice to the state Supreme Court that they will appeal the judge’s ruling. A Maricopa County Superior Court judge on July 12 rejected an effort by the advocates to keep the proposed initiative off the ballot. The advocates argue that the measure breaks the rules because it deals with more than a single subject. Attorney Andy Gaona, who represents some of the groups, said Friday he was working on legal briefs in the cased that were due later in the day. The Legislature will have until July 26 to respond, he said. “We do think that single subject provision was violated,” Gaona said. “We hope that the court agrees.” Supporters of the initiative argue that it deals with a single subject: the border. The GOP-controlled Legislative in early June voted to allow to proposal to be placed on the ballot, asking voters if local law enforcement should be allowed to arrest migrants who cross illegally from Mexico into Arizona between ports of entry. The measure would also give state judges the power to order people convicted of the offense to return to their countries of origin. It is similar to a Texas law that has been put on hold by a federal appeals court while it is being challenged. Unlike the Texas law, Arizona’s proposal would also make it a felony punishable by 10 years of imprisonment for selling fentanyl that leads to a person’s death. Also included is a requirement that some government agencies use a federal database to verify a noncitizen’s eligibility for benefits. The Republican-backed proposal bypasses Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs, who had vetoed a similar measure in early March and has denounced the effort to bring the issue to voters. Supporters of the bill said it was necessary to ensure security along the state’s southern border, and that Arizona voters should be given the opportunity to decide the issue themselves. Opponents say the legislation would lead to racial profiling and create several millions of dollars in additional policing costs that Arizona cities, counties and the state can ill afford. The measure would go before voters in a state expected to play a crucial role in determining which party controls the White House and the U.S. Senate — likely razor-close races in Arizona. Republicans hope it will focus attention on the border, which they accuse Biden of mishandling, and dilute the political benefits Democrats seek from an abortion-rights initiative. Disorder on the border is a top motivator for many Republican voters who former President Donald Trump hopes will vote in big numbers. President Joe Biden in early June unveiled plans to restrict the number of migrants seeking asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border. This isn’t the first time Republican lawmakers in Arizona have tried to criminalize migration. When passing a much-debated 2010 immigration bill, the Arizona Legislature considered expanding the state’s trespassing law to criminalize the presence of immigrants and impose criminal penalties. But the trespassing language was removed and replaced with a requirement that officers, while enforcing other laws, question people’s immigration status if they were believed to be in the country illegally. The questioning requirement was ultimately upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court despite the racial profiling concerns of critics. But courts barred enforcement of other sections of the law.

With the future of President Joe Biden’s reelection campaign in doubt, Williamson’s emissaries have been reaching out to Democratic National Convention delegates to convince them to pull support from Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. “They called me yesterday morning to see if I would send a notarized letter rescinding my support of Biden-Harris,” New York State Assembly Member Robert Carroll told TPM in a phone conversation on Friday. “Utter lunacy … on their part,” he added. “I mean, I just think it’s insane.” A second Democratic National Convention delegate, who requested anonymity to discuss the nomination process, told TPM they knew of another delegate who received outreach from Williamson’s campaign in addition to Carroll. According to Carroll, the person from Williamson’s team framed the delegate play as an effort to nominate a new Democratic candidate in response to the concerns that have erupted inside the party following Biden’s lackluster performance in his June debate against former President Trump. Carroll, who first revealed the calls from Williamson’s team on Twitter, noted he is a pledged delegate. There are over 3,900 pledged DNC delegates from around the country, and the rules specify that they should “in all good conscience reflect the sentiments of those who elected them” and back the winners of the Democratic primary in the area they represent. Because of his victories in the primary, which was largely uncontested, the vast majority of these delegates are pledged to Biden. For his part, Carroll said he is going to nominate Biden at the convention both due to his obligation as a pledged delegate and because he thinks the president is still the best choice to defeat Trump, despite the concerns reportedly raised by party leaders about his candidacy. “I’m an elected member of the Democratic Party. I represent about 145,000 people. I’m an elected delegate. I take that all very, very seriously,” Carroll said, adding, “I think it’s a team effort … and I think we need to stop having a … circular firing squad. “Though I will agree that the debate performance was poor,” he added, “the hysteria of the last three weeks is significantly worse.” Williamson is a “spiritually progressive” author and self-help guru who has stopped and started a presidential bid multiple times during this election cycle. She initially dropped out of the race on Feb. 7 after receiving roughly four percent of the vote in the New Hampshire Democratic primary and about two percent in South Carolina’s Democratic primary. Williamson, who also mounted an unsuccessful presidential bid in 2020, announced the unsuspension of her campaign three weeks later before ending it again last month. After her halting primary bid, Williamson has resurfaced in the midst of the Democratic Party’s post-debate drama. Biden’s performance in that debate, which included multiple moments where he seemed to lose his train of thought and have difficulty expressing himself, have led to widespread concerns about his age, health and whether he can lead the party to victory in November. In recent weeks, numerous Democrats have called for him to abandon his re-election bid, citing their fears he cannot defeat Trump. Despite reports Friday that Biden’s family has considered a potential exit plan, his campaign team has insisted he “is more committed than ever to beat Donald Trump.” On July 3, Williamson announced that she was re-re-entering the race and said the debate made “very clear that the Democrats need a new nominee on the ballot.” Since then, she has launched the operation focused on the DNC delegates. The delegates are set to nominate the Democratic Party’s presidential candidate in a virtual roll call ahead of the convention, which will take place in Chicago starting Aug. 19. In addition to the pledged delegates, there are 739 automatic delegates, who are often called superdelegates. The automatic delegates can vote to nominate any candidate of their choosing, but, as a result of reforms put in place in the wake of the contested 2016 Democratic primary, they cannot vote on the first ballot. A candidate can secure the nomination by winning a majority in that initial vote. If Biden does indeed step aside, his pledged delegates would be released. However, the concerns about his candidacy have caused some delegates and others to wonder if the “good conscience” clause in the party’s rules might allow them to break away even without Biden deciding to end his run. Williamson’s delegate play is centered on this idea. Earlier this week, she released a video outlining her message to delegates and suggesting they can “open up this convention” by sending letters to the DNC. Williamson stressed that these letters would need to be “notarized” and submitted before Friday. “The only chance now to stop this is for you who are delegates to use your power and to step in,” Williamson said in the clip, adding, “You do that by sending a communication … saying that you as a delegate to this convention no longer automatically pledge your vote to Joe Biden, that, according to the dictates of your conscience and your firm belief that we’re in trouble regarding the election in November, you want to hear from any other candidates, you want to open up this convention.” In her video, Williamson stressed that she was not calling for delegates to pledge to support her. “What I’m asking you to do is to just pledge to opening up the convention,” Williamson said. In a note on her site that accompanied the video, Williamson suggested the show of opposition to Biden was focused on convincing the DNC to eliminate a planned, early virtual roll call ahead of the in-person convention. Amid the questions surrounding Biden, others in the party have also raised concerns about the early roll call, which has not been scheduled. In a letter to committee members on Wednesday, the co-chairs of the DNC rules committee indicated the roll call would not occur before Aug. 1 and said it needed to take place prior to the convention due to concerns about ballot access. Carroll, the New York delegate who received the call from Williamson’s team, said they offered to send him text for a potential letter opposing Biden’s nomination. “I told them that I was uninterested and that I wasn’t going to humor them,” he said. Williamson’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment asking how many delegates they believe signed the letters or whether she expected to receive any support at the DNC. Biden’s campaign also did not respond to a request for comment on this story. Carroll said that, in the event that Biden steps aside, he would vote for any candidate recommended by the president and he assumes that would be Harris. He also said there is “no universe” where he would vote to nominate Williamson at the DNC. “To be perfectly honest, I barely know who the hell she is,” Carroll said. “I mean, I know that she’s got like crystals to sell or something, but like, I really, I couldn’t tell you if she walked into my office right now …I wouldn’t know that she was Marianne Williamson,” he continued, adding, “I don’t think of her as a Democratic Party person, I don’t think of her as an elected official, I don’t think of her as a party activist or somebody who has got her finger on the pulse. … I know she’s a kooky person, but I don’t spend — I’ve got too many things going on in my life to spend any time on kooky Marianne Williamson and what her ideas are.”","summary":"Marianne Williamson wants to step into the void.

Zoe Lofgren, a Democratic ‘heavyweight,’ asks Biden to bow out of presidential race","text":"Over the last week, the calls for President Joe Biden to bow out as the presumptive Democratic Party nominee have grown louder, and now, one of the Bay Area’s most prominent Democrats, Rep. Zoe Lofgren, is chiming in. Concerns about Biden’s viability in November started circulating following his unsteady performance at the June 27 presidential debate. Since then, more than two dozen Democratic congressmembers have asked the president to suspend his re-election bid including several members of the California delegation like Reps. Adam Schiff, Mike Levin and Scott Peters, all of whom represent the southern part of the state. But through a July 18 letter sent to the president, Lofgren this week became the first Bay Area congressmember to outright call for Biden to reconsider being on the Democratic ticket. In the letter, Lofgren praised the president for his “policy achievements that have benefited the American people,” and said she respects his “lifetime of public service.” But the polling, she notes, isn’t in his favor and puts him “on a trajectory to lose the White House and potentially impact crucial House and Senate races down ballot.” “As a Member of the House Select Committee to investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol I know, perhaps as well as anyone, how unsuitable Donald Trump is to be President,” Lofgren wrote. “His policies are wrong. His character is unprincipled and corrupt. He remains as grave a threat to the Constitutional order and rule of law that he was on January 6, 2021 when he incited insurrection. And, if he is elected President again, he will dismantle all that Democrats have achieved for the American people.” If Biden ultimately accepts the nomination at the Democratic National Convention next month, Lofgren said she will “do everything I can to promote your candidacy.” David McCuan, a political science professor at Sonoma State University, said that Lofgren joining the call for Biden to step down is significant given her status as “heavyweight” in the Democratic Party. Lofgren, 76, assumed office in 1995, but her time on the Hill dates back to the 1970s when she worked for the late Rep. Don Edwards amid the impeachment of President Richard Nixon. “Her role, her heft, her pull amongst fellow Democrats is significant,” McCuan said. “She’s also a very practically minded politician and she wants to be in a place where they can get things done, especially as she’s closer to the end of her career.” McCuan said that Lofgren — like Schiff — is very close to former speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has reportedly expressed concerns about Biden in private. “The former speaker would have known that this was coming,” McCuan said. Other California Democrats on Friday echoed Lofgren’s call. Rep. Jared Huffman, whose district includes parts of Marin, Mendocino, Sonoma, Humboldt, Trinity and Del Norte counties, released a joint statement with Reps. Marc Veasey (D-TX), Chuy Garcia (D-IL) and Mark Pocan (D-WI) asking Biden to “pass the torch to a new generation of Democratic leaders.” “We must defeat Donald Trump to save our democracy, protect our alliances and the rules-based international order, and continue building on the strong foundation you have established over the past four years,” the representatives said. “At this point, however, we must face the reality that widespread public concerns about your age and fitness are jeopardizing what should be a winning campaign.” Rep. Jim Costa, whose district includes parts of the San Joaquin Valley, also called this week for Biden to rethink his candidacy. “I am proud of the work we have done to pass monumental legislation that is leading to the first real investments in our communities in decades,” Costa said. “But for the good of the country, I think it is time for the President to pass the torch to the next generation to carry on the legacy he started.” Biden’s campaign, however, has brushed aside any calls for him to drop out. “You have heard from the President directly time and again: He is in this race to win, and he is our nominee, and he’s going to be our President for a second term,” Campaign Chair Jen O’Malley Dillon said in a statement. Bill James, the chair of the Santa Clara County Democratic Central Committee, said he’s heard concerns and anxiety from local Democrats since the June debate. The local party, he said, has refrained from taking a position since it’s a decision that’s “being made by party leaders at the highest level.” “I think the decision will be made collaboratively and with President Biden largely in the driver’s seat because he does have the pledged delegates going into the convention,” James said. When it comes to Lofgren’s position though, he said that “if anybody in Democratic politics has a right to express their view publicly about this question of whether President Biden should step aside or not, it’s Rep. Lofgren.”","summary":"Lofgren is one of more than two dozen congressmembers who have asked Biden to reconsider.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/07/19/rep-zoe-lofgren-a-democratic-heavyweight-asks-biden-to-bow-out-of-presidential-race/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Trump-Russia-Probe_2.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-19 22:44:33","author":"Grace Hase","authors":["Grace Hase"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.265},{"id":252193028,"title":"For our kids, any Democrat win means schoolhouse madness","text":"Whether or not President Biden stays at the top of the Democrats’ ticket, America’s children will continue to suffer if he, Kamala Harris, or any member of their party holds on to the White House after November’s election. That’s because every leading Democratic contender remains openly beholden to teachers’ unions at the expense of our kids’ education. Test scores for public-school kids across the country have tanked, and throwing more money at them has done nothing to improve the quality of learning. Meanwhile, outright leftist indoctrination has become prevalent in schools across the country. A second Biden/Harris term would bring us more of the same. As the American Federation of Teachers holds its annual conference in Houston, expect to hear more of the deranged politicized rhetoric that was spewed at the gathering of its sister union earlier this month. “NEA, we have to win all the things!” shouted National Education Association President Becky Pringle in an unhinged rant at its meeting in Philadelphia. “All the things! All the things! All the things! We must win all the things!” Pringle shrieked as she pounded on the podium with her fists. Social media had fun mocking her theatrics, but Pringle’s outburst overshadowed the damaging content presented in the rest of her speech and throughout the conference. The NEA “winning all the things” necessarily means losses for our kids. “We worked hard to rid ourselves of a tyrannical, deceitful, and corrupt White House,” the openly political Pringle boasted of her union’s efforts against former president Donald Trump in the 2020 election. Is it good that someone with so much control over our kids’ learning is such an outrageous partisan? “But … the seeds that were sown during that horrible season continue to germinate,” she railed. Pringle’s main beef against Republicans is their support for school vouchers, and the dastardly idea that money spent on a child’s education should follow the child instead of being sunk into failing public schools. “We will fight privatization! We will fight vouchers! We will fight any and all schemes to drain resources from our beloved public schools,” Pringle yelled. But if the public schools were so “beloved,” parents wouldn’t need vouchers to get their kids a good education. In fact, it’s the nonsense pushed by Pringle and by Randi Weingarten, her counterpart at the AFT, that has parents yanking their kids out of public schools in the first place. Public schools have faced a sharp enrollment drop in the last several years, with some 4% of kids nationally exiting the system. In some states, the number is as high as 8%. If Pringle and Weingarten are wondering why, perhaps they should consult a mirror. AFT members will be voting on a full slate of inane political resolutions, including one calling for a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas. Surely the parties involved in this faraway war have been waiting anxiously for instructions from an American teachers’ union. If this is the kind of nonsense these teachers waste time on in their conferences, imagine what they do in their classrooms. Sex and gender is another teachers-union obsession. An AFT webinar posted this month promised to clarify “gender identity, sex assigned at birth and gender expression” for teachers who find these concepts “super confusing” — while instructing them to address such notions with even the youngest students. The webinar, “Beyond Rainbows & Pronouns: Gender Identity in Elementary School,” awards industry-required professional-development credits to the teachers who complete it. The unions always claim they don’t set school curriculum — but they clearly inculcate our kids’ teachers with leftist thought. Parents who think 6-year-olds shouldn’t be brainwashed about gender identity should have the option to get their kids out of Pringle and Weingarten’s indoctrination factories. And Democrats should be frequently called out on their continued support for these powerful leftist interest groups. The teachers’ unions have been granted tremendous sway in Joe Biden’s White House, where they are treated as heroes instead of the villains they are. Pringle visited the White House at least 24 times between 2021 and early 2024, Fox News reported recently. Weingarten, who was infamously allowed to meddle with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention policies to keep American schools closed in the early months of Biden’s tenure, was invited to the White House immediately after he took office. Kids suffered terrible, long-term learning losses because of the power Weingarten wielded over Joe Biden. Now, every minute spent talking about Biden’s cognitive decline is a minute not spent discussing his disastrous policies and alliances. Biden shouldn’t lose this election because he’s a confused old man propped up by his political allies and media friends; he should lose it because his policies on the economy, on foreign policy, and especially on education have been a disaster. Should Biden step aside? Maybe. Should Democrats start to care more about the well-being of America’s children and less about special interest groups like the AFT and NEA? Definitely.

Musk knew the sprawling grounds well, having stayed in the guesthouse at the Florida property.The topic of conversation was a bit different than usual, though: Peltz had brought together a group of billionaire conservative financiers — including Steve Wynn, the Las Vegas casino magnate, and hedge-funder John Paulson — to dive into concerns about whether Republicans could seize Senate control, as well as the party’s weak ground game, according to a person with direct knowledge of what transpired.But Musk had a darker message that spring day. He told the group that this would be the last free election in America — because if President Joe Biden won, millions of people living in the country illegally would be legalized and democracy would be finished, according to the person.Former President Donald Trump had to win, Musk said. He dispensed some advice for the veteran financiers, who had decades more experience in Republican politics than he did: Their emphasis on political advertising was misplaced, he said. Tesla, his electric car company, barely advertises, he said, but had still built a cult following through word of mouth. Why couldn’t Republicans do the same?The most important thing that the financiers could do, Musk said, was ask two people to support Trump, and urge them to ask two more. Two people by two people — that’s how the former president would win.Musk has transformed himself from an idealistic supporter of Democrats like Barack Obama into a fierce ally of Trump, whom he flirted with for months and endorsed last weekend roughly 30 minutes after the former president survived an assassination attempt.In fact, Trump’s campaign at one point had talked with Musk about him delivering remarks at this week’s Republican National Convention. Musk said Thursday that he was not speaking.Musk is more comfortable than ever revealing his conservative sympathies. But the role that he has played in supporting Republicans financially is not widely known, in part because he has tried to avoid making public donations.He has emerged as a central character in the presidential race, targeted by the Biden campaign and celebrated as an almost mythical figure by Trump’s advisers. Angry at liberals over immigration, transgender rights and the Biden administration’s perceived treatment of Tesla, the mercurial Musk has undergone a midlife reinvention that has many Republicans salivating about him as the party’s moneymaker — if only he will deliver.This article is based on interviews with about two dozen of Musk’s political associates, friends and Republican Party allies, many of whom insisted on anonymity to disclose private conversations. Musk and his aides did not respond to requests for comment.Woody Johnson, a preeminent Republican fundraiser and Trump’s former ambassador to Britain, said he welcomed Musk into the party as an ideological convert.“Explore all ideas — and come up with the best one,” Johnson quipped in an interview. “There’s nobody in the world like Musk. We’re lucky as Americans to have him. He is the most innovative — besides Trump.”Musk was once allergic to Washington. He maintained a decent relationship with Obama and made several White House visits to build support for Tesla and SpaceX, his rocket manufacturer. But he generally disliked meeting with other politicians and saw political donations as a necessary evil, according to four people who worked with him.Days before the 2016 election, he told CNBC that Trump did not “seem to have the sort of character that reflects well on the United States.” After Trump won, Musk told some associates that the outcome was proof that they were living in a simulation, according to one person close to him. In 2020, in a private conversation with another associate, Musk called Trump a “stone-cold loser.”In 2022, the former president, for his part, used an expletive to describe the Tesla CEO at a rally.Musk also predicted that Trump’s days as a political force were finished, according to a private message that was viewed by The New York Times, as he prepared to voice support for Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, whose campaign he helped kick off in 2023.Musk has become an obsession of many Trump officials and Republican fundraisers, who see him as the party’s next great hope — or a meal ticket for themselves. But over the years, he has acquired a reputation in political circles as something of a flake.Some conservative activists said they wished that Musk had followed through more on promises to fund free speech lawsuits by people who believed that they had been censored on social media.Musk can be hard to pin down, and rumors fly about him in Republican circles. In 2023, when Kevin McCarthy was elected as House speaker, the California politician gave a party at the Library of Congress, and some aides were told until shortly beforehand to expect Musk to show up and speak. But he didn’t, disappointing some in the crowd, a person involved in the event recalled.Musk has also been unreliable in local politics. He wrote last year on his social platform, X, that he planned to donate $100,000 to GrowSF, a centrist group in San Francisco, so it could help defeat a progressive city official. But Musk did not donate or even contact the group, said Steven Buss, one of GrowSF’s founders. An Embrace of Dark Money Musk has said that he tries to stay out of politics, and he has not donated to a federal political group since the 2020 cycle, according to campaign finance records. He has gone to great lengths to avoid leaving a public footprint of the contributions he does make.Indeed, he learned a tough lesson when he made his largest disclosed gift ever, a $50,000 donation in 2017, to the McCarthy Victory Fund, a group aligned with McCarthy. The disclosure of that donation angered liberals. He learned from that experience to prioritize giving to dark-money organizations, a person familiar with his thinking recalled.In recent communications with Republicans, Musk and his associates have expressed a desire not to make political contributions to groups whose donations must be legally disclosed. He told a friend a few months ago that he wanted to find a way to support Trump but didn’t want to do it publicly, the friend recalled.During the Republican presidential primary race, Musk’s team had detailed talks with allies of Vivek Ramaswamy about making a major donation to a dark-money group backing the entrepreneur’s candidacy, according to a person briefed on the talks. Musk attended two fundraisers for Ramaswamy, in California and Texas, two people briefed said, but he ultimately declined to cut a check.In 2023, he strongly considered making a significant political donation to the American Action Network, a 501(c) (4) dark-money group steered by McCarthy’s political operation, according to a person with knowledge of the discussions. It’s not clear if he gave.As Musk sought help on politics, the people he turned to sought to influence him.He had gotten to know McCarthy over the last decade thanks to the former speaker’s advocacy for SpaceX. They now text frequently, and Musk has often relied on McCarthy over the years for advice on politics and lobbying.McCarthy has been eager to highlight his relationship with Musk, and has gone to great lengths to cultivate him, according to people familiar with their relationship.He interviewed the billionaire at an exclusive conference in Sea Island, Georgia, hosted by the conservative American Enterprise Institute, and invited Musk to headline a fundraising retreat for McCarthy’s donors in Wyoming. Musk also flew to Washington for the congressman’s birthday last year.McCarthy has helped develop Musk’s relationship with Trump, but he has not been alone. Three close friends of the former president — Peltz, Wynn and Steve Witkoff, whose firm invested in the billionaire’s Twitter takeover — plus Musk’s emerging confidant, Diesel Peltz, a son of Nelson Peltz — have played a role in encouraging Musk to draw close to Trump, according to people familiar with the relationships. Musk also talks frequently with Ramaswamy, who has become a Trump surrogate, another person said.Wynn said in an interview that Musk was “dedicating himself to making sure this election ends up properly” but downplayed his own role.“He did that without my help,” he said. “Elon is a self-propelled rocket.”Some of Musk’s friends in Silicon Valley have also bent his ear, including members of the so-called PayPal Mafia, a group of early executives at the payments company that includes Trump donors David Sacks and Ken Howery, the people said.Musk used to live primarily in Los Angeles, but people close to him said his politics had been shaped by his more conservative social circle in his new home state of Texas. Joe Lonsdale, a co-founder of Palantir who lives in Texas, and his aides have spent considerable time with Musk talking about politics, and Musk has told others that he is worried about what would happen to his businesses if Texas went blue, the people said.But some of Musk’s more liberal friends and associates have expressed unhappiness to him about his rightward drift, according to three people familiar with the situation. Some said they have received private assurances from Musk that he is not donating to support Trump.The extremist direction of Musk has bothered his own high-profile, celebrity lawyer, Alex Spiro, according to two people who have spoken to him. Spiro, who declined to comment, has encouraged Musk not to alienate Democrats from his businesses, citing the famous quip from Michael Jordan that “Republicans buy sneakers, too,” one of the people said.It appears those liberal friends are losing the tug of war. Musk met with Trump in March and now talks with him directly on occasion, according to people familiar with the relationship. The two have spoken about electric vehicles, as well as technology like so-called deepfake videos, the former president has told donors who relayed his remarks.During the Trump term, Musk once asked his top executives at Tesla how many of them had voted for Trump and was alarmed to hear that none of them had, according to a person with knowledge of the meeting.“I have had some conversations with him, and he does call me out of the blue for no reason,” Musk said last month at Tesla’s annual shareholder meeting.Musk and Sacks organized a private dinner this spring in Los Angeles with several other anti-Biden billionaires, who talked about ways to oppose Biden’s reelection.Whether Musk might financially support the Republican ticket has flummoxed Trump’s aides. For much of this year, Musk entertained to friends the notion of an endorsement, or at least urging his followers explicitly not to vote for Biden, according to two people who spoke directly with Musk. The billionaire told these people that he wanted to wait until the president formally captured the Democratic nomination before he made a proclamation.Then came the assassination attempt.Within an hour of the shooting, Musk went on X and endorsed Trump.Lonsdale has helped start a new super political action committee that its donors say will fund an aggressive field program to aid Trump, and several of Musk’s close friends have pooled their millions behind the group. The Wall Street Journal reported that Musk had spoken of donating $45 million per month to the group — energizing both the Trump and Biden teams. But Musk has told people close to him that the figure is false, and while people close to the group said that while they expect him to give, they don’t know how much.In recent weeks, Musk privately lobbied Trump to choose Sen. JD Vance of Ohio as his running mate. He celebrated vociferously Monday after Vance was announced as the pick.Trevor Traina, a Republican fundraiser in San Francisco who served in the Trump administration and knows Musk socially, said he saw parallels between the two men.“He has had to walk the same road as Trump — silenced, targeted, canceled — and within the last couple weeks,” Traina said of Musk, “he has decided it’s time to take action.”","summary":"","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-presidential-election-2024-how-elon-musk-chose-trump/articleshow/111872751.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-111872780/111872780.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-19 22:39:19","author":"NYT News Service","authors":["NYT News Service"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"IN","sentiment":-0.054},{"id":252193590,"title":"A Searing Reminder That Trump Is Unwell","text":"Donald Trump’s bizarre diatribe at the Republican National Convention shows why the prodemocracy coalition is so worried about beating the GOP nominee—even if it means that Joe Biden must step down. But first, here are three new stories from The Atlantic. Not Comparable It’s been quite a year in politics, what with President Biden facing calls to drop out of the race and Trump having a meltdown in public after an assassination attempt and … I’m sorry, did I say a year? I meant a week. So much has happened, and political events have become so freakish, that we can all be forgiven for losing our bearings a bit. For the past few days, I’ve felt like Homer Simpson after he accidentally turned a toaster into a time machine and came back to find that Ned Flanders was the unchallenged dictator of the world. But in the midst of all this, two things remain clear: These are not comparable problems. Nor did Biden and Trump have equally bad weeks. Biden is facing a revolt in his own party and is now recovering from COVID. Trump was nearly killed by a young loner. Biden claims to still be in the race, an answer many elected Democrats have refused to accept. My colleague Russell Berman wrote yesterday afternoon that Senator Peter Welch of Vermont believes that the Biden campaign may be at an end; more telling is that Russell described Welch as the only member of the upper chamber making that argument, but from the time that Russell wrote that article to this afternoon, three more sitting Democratic U.S. senators—Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Jon Tester of Montana, and Martin Heinrich of New Mexico—called for Biden to step down. The case for Biden leaving the race is evident to anyone who’s watched him over the past month. He seems to be no better in his public outings than he was during the debate, and has sometimes seemed worse. As I’ve said here, I don’t think that means he can’t run the country for the remainder of his term, but Trump is going to be fired up and on the road, and I doubt that Biden can match that level of engagement, which could be decisive in a race that will be won on slim margins in a handful of states. I suspect that the people voting to save democracy would vote for Biden if he were governing from a cryostatic tube, but the Democrats calling on him to wrap it up have perfectly valid fears that he could lose and take the down-ballot races with him. Meanwhile, the Republican National Convention was a searing reminder that Trump is a vengeful autocrat with obvious mental deficits who has surrounded himself with a crew of vicious goons. I approached Trump’s speech with genuine curiosity. I was for most of my life a working political scientist, and I have written speeches for politicians; I think I know a good one when I see one. So I watched last night to see if Trump, tamed by a brush with death, would strike a new tone or, at the very least, try to make peace with one of his most hated enemies: the teleprompter. No chance. To be fair, some people who watched the speech thought that the first 10 minutes or so, in which Trump recounted being injured, were good, even thoughtful. I thought they were terrible; although Trump and his people have emphasized Trump’s defiance in the moment after he was hurt, his blow-by-blow account of the incident came across to me as creepy and solipsistic rather than brave. Contrast that with Ronald Reagan, the previous president injured in an attempt on his life. Karen Tumulty of The Washington Post reminded us today that Reagan appeared before Congress a month after he was nearly killed. (His injuries were severe and life-threatening.) Reagan was on the Hill to talk about the economy, but he started by thanking the country for its prayers and good wishes, noting a cute letter he got from a child while he was in the hospital, and paying tribute to the people injured alongside him. This digression took all of four paragraphs, a matter of a few minutes. “Now, let’s talk about getting spending and inflation under control and cutting your tax rates,” he then said. Trump, however, droned on about how much the human ear can bleed, while the screens behind him showed huge pictures of blood on his face. He then went over to the equipment owned by Corey Comperatore, the volunteer firefighter killed in the attack, and kissed the helmet. Some in the crowd may have loved it, but I prefer a bit more stoicism in national leaders; I’ve always thought that Trump’s penchant for hugging and kissing flags was weird, and planting a kiss on the headgear of a dead man was even weirder. And then things really went off the rails. If you didn’t sit through it, I can’t blame you; it was the longest presidential-nomination-acceptance speech on record. Basking in the friendliest audience he will ever find on this planet, Trump couldn’t help himself. He was supposed to be like a band at a concert doing a tight set, playing some favorites for the loyal fans, introducing a little new material, and gaining a wider audience. Instead, he blew the chance and ran overtime as he noodled, improvised, and even mangled some of his classics. The speech wasn’t written that way, of course, but Trump can’t stick to a script. You can always tell when Trump is trying to read the teleprompter: His shoulders tense up, he cocks his head and squints, and he rushes through words he has clearly never seen before. It doesn’t help that Trump’s writers stuff his speeches with baroque constructions that are supposed to be soaring and majestic but that always end up sounding more like dollar-store Churchill imitations. Trump struggles with these complex sentences, and then he abandons them—and that is when the real Trump comes out, in all his whiny and aggrieved glory. I do not have the space (or the endurance) to relive those moments with you, but they were the ramblings of a man who has serious psychological problems. All of it was on display last night: rage, paranoia, pettiness, desolating selfishness. I’m always sorry to leave readers with these sorts of observations just before a weekend, but much of the media response to Biden’s troubles and Trump’s madness has been mired in equivalences that obscure what’s happening to both men, and what’s at stake for the nation. (As I was writing this, for example, a Washington Post newsletter arrived in my inbox and told me that the GOP had just wrapped up “an energized, focused convention.” That’s an interesting description of a Republican gathering that featured a sex worker, Hulk Hogan, and a spaced-out Trump.) Yes, Biden is old, and he’s having trouble communicating. The people expressing serious concerns about him have good reason to worry about both his health and his ability to defeat Trump. He might be out of the race by next week. But Trump is mentally and emotionally unwell. He and his valet, J. D. Vance, are not going anywhere. The real tragedy is that, in a serious country, Biden might step down without incident, and a normal race would continue, because decent people would have banished Trump from the public square long ago.

In November 2012, I was 22 and had left the family farm in Manitoba to find work in the oil fields of Alberta. I arrived during a bust and, because work was not immediate, spent the days driving my Ford F-150 around the country surrounding Calgary, listening to AM radio and my small collection of CDs—a few Rolling Stones albums, some outlaw-country records, and the complete discography of Creedence Clearwater Revival. The Ford was what they call a SuperCab, with a rear backward-opening half door and a narrow bench for a back seat. At night, lacking the money for a hotel, I would find a quiet place to park, crawl into the back seat, and stretch out on the bench, my clothes wrapped around my boots for a pillow. I kept my guitars—an acoustic Martin and an electric Epiphone Les Paul—beside me to warm them, lest they crack in the cold. The nights weren’t kind to me either, and I often woke up shivering, the world outside covered with frost or snow. To allay myself, I’d run the engine for a while and put on Creedence.

In Yasmin Zaher’s debut novel, The Coin, the promise of exclusivity is a facade. P.S. Some of you may have noticed that I don’t particularly admire Trump’s running mate, Senator J. D. Vance of Ohio. (Vance has noticed it too.) I wrote about his RNC speech here. I remain appalled at Vance’s casual betrayal of the people he claims to care about, the poor and working-class whites he grew up with in Ohio. Perhaps I feel this more keenly because I grew up in a working-class town in Massachusetts, and I think working people deserve a better spokesperson than an opportunistic plutocrat like Vance. You may find it striking to think of New England as a depressed area; people who are not from the region probably think of it as a lovely expanse of college greens and church steeples and foliage. And it is—but much of New England was once home to mills and factories that produced shoes, textiles, and even military swords. (The bronze doors of the U.S. Capitol’s House wing were cast in 1903 in my hometown of Chicopee.) By the late 1970s, many of those workplaces, abandoned as industries moved out of the Northeast and sometimes out of the United States, were rotting hulks. If you’d like to read a memoir that shows what it was like to grow up in Massachusetts in those days, I’d suggest Townie: A Memoir, by Andre Dubus III, who is near my age and grew up in a mill town much like mine. It’s not a pretty read, but it is evocative—so much so that some passages made me wince. I can affirm that it captures the reality of growing up in a part of America, far from Vance’s hometown, that was also plagued by dysfunction and decline. — Tom Did someone forward you this email?

Sherrod Brown said in a late Friday afternoon statement that President Joe Biden should drop his reelection campaign. Brown, a Cleveland Democrat, is locked in a tight reelection race that could decide control of the U.S. Senate in November. He joins dozens of other congressional Democrats in urging Biden to drop out of the race after Biden’s shaky performance in the first debate, in which he trailed off and appeared to lose his train of thought as he answered questions and responded to his Republican opponent, former President Donald Trump. For weeks, Brown has said he was listening to Ohioans who have shared concerns about Biden. On Friday, he said he agreed with those who say he should drop his campaign. “Over the last few weeks, I’ve heard from Ohioans on important issues, such as how to continue to grow jobs in our state, give law enforcement the resources to crack down on fentanyl, protect Social Security and Medicare from cuts, and prevent the ongoing efforts to impose a national abortion ban. These are the issues Ohioans care about and it is my job to keep fighting for them,” Brown said in a prepared statement. “I agree with the many Ohioans who have reached out to me. At this critical time, our full attention must return to these important issues. I think the President should end his campaign.” Brown was the second Ohioan to call on Biden to withdraw Friday. U.S. Rep. Greg Landsman, who represents a competitive Cincinnati-area district, did so as well. Dozens of Democrats in Congress now are calling for Biden, 81, to step aside and let another candidate replace him ahead of the party’s national convention in August. Biden, who was diagnosed with COVID-19 this week, reiterated in a Friday statement that he was staying in the race and that he would return to the campaign trail next week. Brown will face Republican Bernie Moreno, a former Cleveland area businessman, as he seeks a fourth term in the Senate in November.","summary":"U.S. Sen.

In a statement, Biden said that Trump’s remarks at the RNC on Thursday night focused on his own grievances and had no plans to make life better for working people. “Last night the American people saw the same Donald Trump they rejected four years ago. For over 90 minutes, he focused on his own grievances, with no plan to unite us and no plan to make life better for working people,” Biden said on Friday.He insisted that he would again defeat Trump in November amid growing calls for the president to drop out of the race.Calls from Democrat members became louder on Friday, when Senator Martin Heinrich became the third Democratic senator to call for Biden to move aside, and four House Democrats issued a joint statement urging the president to end his reelection bid.In a statement, Biden said, “Donald Trump’s dark vision for the future is not who we are as Americans. Together, as a party and as a country, we can and will defeat him at the ballot box,” The Hill reported. He further said, “I look forward to getting back on the campaign trail next week to continue exposing the threat of Donald Trump’s Project 2025 agenda while making the case for my own record and the vision that I have for America: one where we save our democracy, protect our rights and freedoms, and create opportunity for everyone.” Biden also said that Trump “avoided mentioning his Project 2025 agenda, but still proudly flaunted the worst of MAGA extremism,” echoing the response from his campaign chair, Jen O’Malley Dillon, to the former president’s speech at the convention Thursday night.O’Malley Dillon said Trump did not mention Project 2025 even once. The Biden campaign has tried to connect Trump to the controversial conservative policy blueprint from the Heritage Foundation, while Trump and his team have aggressively attempted to distance themselves from it, The Hill reported. Former US President Donald Trump kicked off his Presidential campaign with a rousing speech at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee on Thursday night local time. Trump attacked the Democrats for continuously targeting him and his family and said that it was time to focus on making America great again.“Enough with the Subpoenas, Let’s Focus on America ‘Don and others faced countless subpoenas from Democrats like Nancy Pelosi. They must stop this, as it’s harming our country. We need to focus on making America great again, not beating people. We won against impeachments and indictments, but the time wasted is damaging. If that effort went towards helping America, we’d be much stronger,” he said.Speaking to the Republican cadre, Trump endorsed his running mate and Senator from Ohio, JD Vance. While accepting his nomination, Trump said that he would be the President for all of America.“I am running to be President for all America, not half of America because there is no victory in winning for half of America. So, tonight with faith and devotion I proudly accept your nomination for president of the United States, In 4 months we will have an incredible victory. We will launch a new era of peace and prosperity, for all religions, people and creeds. I will be the president of all of America and not of half of America because there is no victory by half,” Trump said.","summary":"The News Mill","url":"https://thenewsmill.com/2024/07/biden-says-he-will-return-to-campaign-trail-next-week-criticises-trumps-speech-at-rnc-as-dark-vision/","image":"https://thenewsmill.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/biden-says-he-will-return-to-campaign-trail-next-week-criticises-trumps-speech-at-rnc-as-dark-vision.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-19 22:34:41","author":"ANI","authors":["ANI"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.464},{"id":252192502,"title":"‘Money for Biden is drying up’ as Kamala Harris sells out $2M Saturday fundraiser: source","text":"Kamala Harris is taking center stage at a sold-out fundraiser this weekend as Joe Biden’s influence with donors grinds to a halt. While Biden has struggled to raise financial support over the last few weeks as top democratic leaders like Sen. Chuck Schumer and Rep. Nancy Pelosi urge for his ouster, the vice-president has managed to sell out a fundraiser Saturday in Provincetown, Mass., that has raised nearly $2 million from 800 attendees, The Post has learned. As fundraising is said to be “on hold” for Biden, who is recovering from Covid in his Delaware home, buzz around Harris is increasing, and donors are looking to ingratiate themselves to the vice-president — who is expected to be placed at the top of the ticket if Biden bows out of the race. “The money for Biden is drying up,” one deep-pocketed source told The Post. “He is a dead man walking.” On Friday, Harris hosted a hastily organized call for donors — including LinkedIn co-founder and mega-donor Reid Hoffman and Biden campaign co-chair Jeffrey Katzenberg — to reiterate that she and Biden remain focused on beating Trump, The New York Times was first to report. Despite Harris’ public calls to rally behind Biden, political fundraising organizations like Emily’s List, a PAC committed to electing Democratic woman, and Way to Win, a group that can move funds quickly to candidates, are beginning to speak with donors about the possibility of giving to Harris should she replace Biden, The Post has learned. “She’s not going to have a problem raising money,” a longtime Democratic fundraiser said. “She boosts the ticket … she energizes people.” In the event Biden steps down, Harris would get the money the campaign has raised. While Biden has close to $200 million in his war chest, sources close to the campaign say the goal has been to raise more than double that amount. But since his disastrous June 27 debate, fundraising has taken a serious hit. One source said that some donors are averse to replacing Biden because they could lose sway with the White House if the president and his advisers are replaced. “The reason people are huge supporters is because they’re wired into the White House… most people with a lot of money are focused on that,” the source said. The campaign did not respond to a request for comment. On Thursday, political risk firm Signup Global told investors that the chance of Biden dropping out had increased to 65%, up from 40% the day prior. The firm noted the combination of pressure from members of Congress and dismal polling — which they believe will get worse — will force him out. Meanwhile, a growing chorus of Democrats in the House and Senate continues calling for Biden to step down.","summary":"Kamala Harris is taking center stage at a sold-out fundraiser this weekend as Joe Biden’s influence with donors grinds to a halt.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/07/19/us-news/money-for-biden-is-drying-up-as-harris-sells-out-2m-fundraiser/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/biden-harris-hoffman.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1721412684&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-19 22:32:54","author":"Lydia Moynihan","authors":["Lydia Moynihan"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.197},{"id":252193050,"title":"Vulnerable Democrat Sherrod Brown asks Biden to suspend reelection bid","text":"Sen.

Morale was near rock bottom. And the party’s presidential nominee showed little desire, or capacity, to add new voters to his political coalition. What a difference eight years make. The Republican officials, strategists and activists who packed Milwaukee for the Republican National Convention this week expressed a collective confidence at levels not seen in decades. Boos and infighting marred Donald Trump’s first convention in 2016, but this one was defined by overwhelming displays of unity as GOP leaders — Trump skeptics among them — reveled in what most view as an all but certain victory come November. Trump’s survival after nearly being assassinated at a Pennsylvania rally over the weekend, they said, was the last piece to bring everyone together in spite of the former president’s extraordinary personal and political baggage. “It feels like 1980,” said a smiling New York GOP Chair Ed Cox on the convention’s red-carpeted floor this week, referring to Ronald Reagan’s landslide presidential victory. Cox pointed to a sense of inevitability building around Trump and the GOP. “We finally came completely together.” For Democrats, it is the worst of times. Back in Washington, the party intensified a public and private lobbying effort to force President Joe Biden to drop out of the race after his disastrous debate against Trump last month. Donors, elected officials and leaders within Biden’s own campaign believe he cannot win. And an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll indicated that the vast majority of Democratic voters have lost confidence in Biden’s ability to govern and want him to step aside before it is too late to stop Trump. Only about a third of Democrats believe Biden is more capable than Trump of winning in November, according to the poll, which also found that nearly two-thirds of Democrats say Biden should withdraw from the presidential race and let his party nominate a different candidate. By contrast, about 7 in 10 Republicans say Trump is more capable of winning the election. Almost no Republicans think Biden is more capable of winning. The doubters include Black Democrats, who make up the backbone of Biden’s political coalition. Only about half of Black Democrats think Biden is better able to win, according to the poll. Many Democrats now privately expect — or perhaps hope — that someone other than Biden will be on stage to accept the party’s nomination when the Democratic National Convention begins in Chicago in a month. Hours before Trump’s triumphant convention speech on Thursday, a top Biden campaign official repeatedly pushed back against a flurry of new questions about whether the president is going to step aside. “I do not want to be rude, but I don’t know how many more times I can answer that,” Quentin Fulks, principal deputy manager of Biden’s reelection campaign, told a news conference in Milwaukee when asked whether the president’s commitment to his reelection may be softening. “There are no plans being made to replace Biden on the ballot.” There’s still plenty of time for surprises Election Day is 109 days away. The first early votes will be cast in just eight weeks. And recent elections suggest that the conventional wisdom is often wrong. Some national polls do show a close race, though others suggest Trump with a lead. Some state polls have contained warning signs for Biden, too, including a recent New York Times/Siena poll that suggested a competitive race in Virginia, a state Republicans last won 20 years ago. But history is littered with examples of stunning political upsets, including Trump’s own 2016 election against Democrat Hillary Clinton. “Every time you start to get confident, pick up an article about Tom Dewey,” former House Speaker Newt Gingrich told a convention luncheon this week, referring to a Republican challenger who was favored against a struggling Democratic president in 1948. “Tom Dewey was picking his Cabinet … in mid-September because the election was over,” Gingrich said. “Republicans were totally confident. And Harry Truman won.” Trump also enters the general election with huge liabilities. He is the first major party nominee to be found liable of sexual abuse in a civil trial. In May, he was convicted of 34 felonies for trying to hide hush money payments to a former porn actor during the 2016 election. Rioters loyal to Trump swarmed the U.S. Capitol less than four years ago, inspired by his lies about the election he lost to Biden. In the vast majority of his public appearances in the years since, Trump has spread the same lies about election fraud that triggered the insurrection — and he has laid the foundation for similar calls if he does not win in November. Politically, he takes credit for the Supreme Court’s reversal of Roe v. Wade, which has led to a crush of unpopular abortion restrictions across the nation, even as he tries to distance himself from Republican calls for a national abortion ban. And Democrats have spent months linking him to the maximalist ideas of the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025, staffed by many of his allies and former aides, which has proposed firing tens of thousands of government workers and imposing sweeping changes across American life. Trump’s campaign is eying longtime Democratic states But dozens of Republicans interviewed at the convention this week pointed to a rare confluence of events — from a judge Trump appointed dismissing the classified documents case against him in Florida, to Biden’s struggles, to the failed July 13 assassination attempt — that give them supreme confidence. Republican National Committee member Henry Barbour, who did not support Trump in the recent primary, predicted that Trump is poised to become the first Republican in 20 years to win the popular vote. “I didn’t vote for Trump in the primary. I voted for Nikki Haley. But I am moved by him talking about his desire to bring the country together,” Barbour said. “Going through a near-death experience, and I’ve done it, it really tends to focus the mind.” Matt Mowers, a strategist who worked on Trump’s first political campaign, said that Trump’s worst day in the 2024 campaign, politically speaking, is better than his best day during that 2016 campaign. And Trump pollster and senior adviser Tony Fabrizio said Trump now has more than two dozen realistic paths to clinch the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency. The most likely, he said, comes by adding Georgia and Pennsylvania to the states Trump carried in 2020. But Fabrizio also pointed to legitimate opportunities to compete in Democratic-leaning Minnesota and Virginia and even Democratic strongholds like New Mexico, New Jersey and Maine. “The more they are in denial about the situation, the better it is for us,” Fabrizio said.

So far, only one of its roughly 60 members have joined calls for Biden to drop his reelection bid due to concerns over his age and ability to win. But the caucus' broad backing of the president varies widely, ranging from enthusiastic support to outright skepticism. And a small but growing number within the group are publicly expressing doubts about Biden's candidacy. Black voters are widely credited with helping Biden clinch the Democratic nomination four years ago and then defeat Republican Donald Trump. Whether Black lawmakers stick with the president now, and how fervently they do so, could be critical in the coming days as pressure builds from the highest levels of the Democratic Party for Biden to end his campaign. Biden’s approval ratings with Black Americans are down from when he took office, reflecting weakened enthusiasm. Among Democrats nationwide, nearly two-thirds say Biden should step aside and let his party nominate a different candidate, according to an AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll. In that same poll, Black Democrats were split on whether Biden should remain or stand down as the nominee. For now, the CBC remains a bedrock of Biden's support. Several members have emerged as prominent defenders. “President Biden, as I’ve said repeatedly, is our nominee,” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a member of the CBC, told reporters on Friday, calling Biden “one of the most accomplished American presidents in our history.” “He has the vision, I believe, the ability, the capacity and the track record to make a case to the American people that will result in us being successful in November,” Jeffries said. Rep. Joyce Beatty, a former CBC chair, said Biden is fully capable of campaigning effectively enough to beat Trump. “Not only do I believe it, I know it,” Beatty said. “Biden is at his best against the odds.\" “I am a Biden delegate. I will only take directions from Joe Biden, not the Fourth Estate, not the billionaires, and not from my very influential colleagues,\" said Rep. Gwen Moore. Still, a crack emerged Friday as Rep. Marc Veasey of Texas became the first CBC member to call for Biden's withdrawal. Ending his campaign, Veasey said in a joint statement with three other Democrats, is the “responsible and patriotic thing to do.” The unprecedented upheaval over Biden's candidacy began June 27, when the president's performance in the debate against Trump stoked concerns about his age and ability to persuade doubtful voters. Biden gave meandering answers and frequently appeared to lose his train of thought as he struggled to parry Trump's attacks and make the case for his candidacy. Democratic panic erupted immediately. As the furor deepened, Biden quickly held a virtual call with the CBC, his first meeting with a major group of lawmakers after the debate, to thank them for their support. “You’ve had my back, and I promise I’m going to have yours,” he said. Central to many CBC members' support of Biden is a sense that the stakes of the election mean any party infighting will harm the interests of Black Americans and the group's overwhelming priority of defeating Trump. CBC members have been adamant in private conversations that they must focus instead on mobilizing Black communities, Democrats’ most consistent voting bloc. “What you hear and see from Black voters is a true reflection of the simple fact that in every election we are casting a survival vote,” said Antjuan Seawright, a Democratic strategist and senior advisor to Rep. Jim Clyburn, the South Carolina Democrat who endorsed Biden four years ago in his state's primary, paving the way for Biden's victory and consolidation of the Democratic field. Clyburn, who remains one of Biden’s most influential supporters, has expressed openness to a hypothetical “mini-primary” should Biden step aside, though he later stressed he was speaking only in the hypothetical. “We're now at a point where people are talking about, ‘Biden is too old.’ Hell, I'm older than Biden,” said California Rep. Maxine Waters, who at 85 is four years older than the president, during an appearance at the Essence Festival. “I want to tell you, no matter what anybody else said, it ain't going to be no other Democratic candidate. It's going to be Biden and we better know it,” she added. Before the attempted assassination of Trump at a rally in Pennsylvania, Biden was set to hold a crucial week of events focused on Black and Latino voters. But the White House canceled a planned appearance on Monday to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the passage of the Civil Rights Act at the LBJ Presidential Library in Austin due to the weekend's events. Biden delivered remarks as planned at the annual convention of the NAACP on Tuesday, where he said “our politics have gotten too heated” and that Americans “must stand against all violence,” tying the attack on Trump's life to recent deadly mass shootings, police killings of unarmed Black Americans and race riots throughout the nation's history. Then the following day, Biden's scheduled remarks to the national convention of UnidosUS, a Latino civil rights group, were canceled after he tested positive for COVID-19. The diagnosis sidelined Biden as many in his party fretted calls for his resignation. Much of the concern over Biden's candidacy revolves around the potential impact on all Democrats running for office. Biden and Democrats are depending on overwhelming and enthusiastic support from Black voters to buoy their chances of victory in November, meaning high pessimism could be determinative in competitive races. On July 10, Rep. Ritchie Torres of New York wrote on social media that the party must have “a serious reckoning with the down-ballot effect of whomever we nominate” and that the decision should be guided by “an unsentimental analysis of the cold hard numbers—which have no personal feelings or political loyalties.” Among Black activists and civil rights leaders, there is concern about low Black voter enthusiasm as communities grapple with issues like rising living costs. “African Americans are more concerned with the policy priorities of whoever is the next president. They also want to see a president who is going to unify this country and focus more on solutions and not create dog whistles and soundbites that cause division,” said NAACP President Derrick Johnson in an interview just ahead of Biden's convention speech. But multiple Black Democratic strategists close to the CBC contended that depressed turnout will not be an issue once Black voters mobilize around the stakes of the election and opposition to Trump, who remains largely unpopular in Black communities. “Because we know that not all progress is permanent, and because we know that old battles have become new again, everything that we have generationally fought for still remains a top of mind fight,” Seawright said.","summary":"The Congressional Black Caucus prides itself on its authority among Democrats and its influence with President Joe Biden in particular.

In a joint statement on Friday morning, four US House members — Jared Huffman, Mark Pocan, Chuy Garcia and Marc Veasey — said it was time for the 81-year-old president to “pass the torch to a new generation of Democratic leaders”. “We must face the reality that widespread public concerns about your age and fitness are jeopardising what should be a winning campaign,” the politicians added. House Democrats Sean Casten, Greg Landsman, Zoe Lofgren, Kathy Castor, Betty McCollum, Morgan McGarvey and Gabe Vasquez also called on Biden to drop out on Friday. Meanwhile, New Mexico senator Martin Heinrich became the third Democratic member of the upper chamber of Congress to urge Biden to drop out, joining Jon Tester of Montana and Vermont’s Peter Welch. “This moment in our nation’s history calls for a focus that is bigger than any one person,” Henrich said, adding it was “in the best interests of our country” for the president to end his campaign. Biden insisted on Friday that he would remain in the race, saying in a statement he “look[ed] forward to getting back on the campaign trail next week to continue exposing the threat of Donald Trump’s Project 2025 agenda”. The president has been isolating at his holiday home in Delaware since testing positive for Covid-19 on Wednesday. White House doctor Kevin O’Connor said on Friday that Biden’s symptoms had “improved meaningfully” and he would continue taking Paxlovid, the antiviral drug. The new wave of lawmakers calling for Biden to quit comes as Democratic party grandees such as former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, as well as the megadonors crucial to funding his campaign, heap pressure on him behind the scenes. The Financial Times reported on Thursday that donors and other senior party operatives believe Biden is very close to a decision to exit the race. On Friday, Michael Moritz, the venture capitalist and Democrat megadonor, called on Biden to step aside, saying the president had a choice between “vanity or virtue” in remarks first reported by The New York Times and confirmed by Moritz. He added that Biden’s attempts to hold on for a second term risked damaging the country, but did not say who he would back to replace him. Chris Coons, the Democratic senator and close Biden ally, said on Friday that the president was getting the necessary advice to make a decision about his political future. “I am confident he is hearing what he needs to hear,” he said while speaking on a panel at the Aspen Security Forum. But Coons — who insisted Biden was “strong” and “capable” enough to carry on — acknowledged the unease within the Democratic party, saying: “There is a lot of concern and anxiety because the stakes are so significant.” The latest interventions came a day after Trump formally accepted the Republican party’s nomination for president, less than a week after he narrowly escaped assassination in Pennsylvania. The former president has surged ahead of Biden in the polls despite his recent criminal convictions, building a lead across the crucial swing states that will decide November’s vote. More than 30 members of Congress have now said Biden needs to drop his re-election bid, a view shared privately by many more who have not yet gone public. But some fear that risks a new split within the party. However, some Democrats, including many progressives, have supported him. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez used an Instagram livestream in the early hours of Friday to fiercely defend the president and accuse “donors” and “elites” of trying to cast him and vice-president Kamala Harris aside. Biden’s disastrous debate performance against Trump last month sparked panic in the Democratic party over his age and fitness for office. After testing positive for Covid in Nevada he was seen apparently struggling to ascend a staircase into Air Force One to return home.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nUnlock the US Election Countdown newsletter for free A growing number of&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Increasing number of Democratic officials urge Joe Biden to drop out of presidential campaign first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/business/increasing-number-of-democratic-officials-urge-joe-biden-to-drop-out-of-presidential-campaign/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ic_launcher.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-19 22:23:18","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.265},{"id":252193984,"title":"Biden remains publicly defiant amid growing Democratic opposition: From the Politics Desk","text":"Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team’s latest reporting and analysis from the campaign trail, the White House and Capitol Hill.

Sign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here. Biden remains publicly defiant as Democratic opposition grows louder By Adam Wollner More than three weeks after President Joe Biden’s debate debacle, the chorus of Democrats calling on him to exit the 2024 race is only growing louder. Publicly, Biden is remaining defiant, while privately, his family is discussing what ending his re-election bid might look like. And Vice President Kamala Harris’ allies are beginning to map out a potential campaign if she were to take over the top of the party’s ticket. Here’s the state of play as of Friday evening: Mounting pressure: Thirteen more congressional Democrats called on Biden to drop out of the presidential race today, bringing the total to 35, Scott Wong, Ali Vitali and Rebecca Kaplan report. The new defections include two close allies of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Reps. Jared Huffman and Zoe Lofgren of California, and two senators, Sens. Sherrod Brown of Ohio (first reported by Henry J. Gomez) and Martin Heinrich of New Mexico. Brown in particular is significant, as he is one of the most vulnerable Senate Democrats seeking re-election this year. Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts re-upped his call for Biden to exit in a Boston Globe op-ed, writing that the president “didn’t seem to recognize me” at a D-Day event in Normandy last month. But Biden also received a boost from Capitol Hill today, as BOLD PAC, the political arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, endorsed his campaign. Public defiance, private discussions: Biden continues to be sidelined as he deals with Covid (White House physician Kevin O’Connor said his symptoms have “improved meaningfully“ since yesterday). But his campaign was still plenty active — and the president pledged to be back in action soon. Biden attacked former President Donald Trump’s GOP convention speech, saying in a statement this afternoon that he looked “forward to getting back on the campaign trail next week.” In a new memo, his campaign said the party has “no plan for an alternative nominee.” And campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon appeared on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” to relay the message that Biden is “absolutely” still in the race. “He’s not going anywhere,” she said. In an all-staff campaign call this afternoon, O’Malley Dillon encouraged her team to focus on the work and the voters who are voicing support for the president, Mike Memoli reports. The Democratic National Committee also carried on with business as usual, moving forward with the plan to nominate Biden via a virtual roll call in early August. Ben Kamisar and Alex Seitz-Wald note that while party rules provide a clear path for Democrats to replace Biden before or after that vote, a decision to replace him for political reasons later than that gets into thorny territory, effectively becoming a lost cause by early September. Privately, however, members of Biden’s family have discussed what an exit from his campaign might look like, Carol E. Lee, Monica Alba, Sarah Fitzpatrick, Jonathan Allen and Natasha Korecki report. The overall tone of the conversations has been that any departure plan — should Biden decide to take that step, as some of his closest allies increasingly believe he will — should put the party in the best position to beat Trump while also being worthy of the more than five decades he has served the country in elected office. Harris in the spotlight: A group of Democrats who believe Harris should be the party’s nominee if Biden steps aside have begun quietly mapping out what her presidential campaign apparatus would look like and what her path to victory could be in November, reports Yamiche Alcindor. The effort, which Harris has not sanctioned, comes as many are concerned that the vice president does not currently have the personnel or organization needed to quickly make the pivot to the top of the ticket. Harris held a call with major Democratic donors this afternoon, expressing confidence that she and Biden will win the election, Vitali and Alba report. She also made a Biden-esque move earlier in the afternoon, making a stop at a new ice cream shop in Washington, D.C., owned by Tyra Banks. Stay up to date on all the latest 2024 election developments with our live blog → A whole new campaign By Chuck Todd Six weeks ago, it seemed fairly clear the country was uninterested in the Biden-Trump rematch. Even the ratings for the first debate, consequential though it was, were shockingly low. At 51 million viewers, it was the lowest-rated first general election debate for a presidential race since we started tracking TV viewership for these things. Polling also indicated lower interest in this campaign and an extreme distaste for the choices the two major parties were offering. North of 50% of voters were regularly saying they’d like to see anyone other than these two run for president. In short, voters were telling us in all sorts of ways that this matchup was one they didn’t want and they weren’t going to tune in to — until, perhaps, the last possible minute. After all, these two candidates, as far as voters were concerned, were well defined. What new information would voters think they needed? Well, there’s a reason we political reporters like to utter the cliché that sometimes a month (or a week) is a lifetime in politics. Because right now, we’re in the midst of experiencing a second or a third lifetime politically, just since that June 27 debate. We are now going from a presidential campaign that left the public disinterested and at times disgusted to a campaign that I could see generating an electorate that might be as interested, if not more so, as in 2008 and 2020, two of the highest-turnout elections in the last 50 years. And the more the public tunes in, the more volatile this election could become again. Before the assassination attempt, there wasn’t a scenario in which I believed Trump could persuade skeptics to give him a second look, let alone win over voters who decided not to support him in 2020 — especially after his actions on Jan. 6, 2021, in particular. And perhaps he still won’t be able to win these folks over. But I do have a feeling that these skeptics will be curious enough about whether Saturday changed Trump to at least check him out, maybe by tuning into some of Thursday’s acceptance speech. And that’s an opportunity. Meanwhile, if the Democrats do end up with a new nominee — and it’s looking more likely by the hour that they will — that, too, is likely to suddenly trigger interest in what the new nominee has to say, which in turn could engage the electorate in a way that the pre-debate version of this campaign just didn’t. Bottom line: We are getting awfully close to the moment when it might be fair to say, “Throw out everything you thought you knew about this election.” Read more from Chuck → A party can get it wrong — and has before By Steve Kornacki Battleground polls look bad. Forecasting models are gloomier. States assumed to be safely in their column now seem in play. The realization that their presidential candidate has no realistic path to victory is sweeping the party. Panicked leaders are speaking out, more and more by the hour. Dozens are now publicly demanding their candidate exit the race. And the other party is licking its chops, thinking big not just about a win but about a landslide up and down the ballot. It’s happening now with Democrats and Biden, yes, but it’s also happened before. It was eight Octobers ago when Republicans erupted in panic at the latest — and most dramatic, to date — uproar around their nominee. The release of the “Access Hollywood” tape convinced scores of major Republicans that Trump’s path to victory had gone from small to nonexistent, and a frantic 36-hour push to dislodge him from the top of the ticket ensued. You know the rest. How and why Trump prevailed, even after his party’s leaders disowned him, is worth keeping in mind as Biden refuses to relent to similar pressure. There will always be debate over what exactly put Trump over the top, but however you arrive at it, one critical variable does stand out: his opponent’s profound unpopularity.

Flights were grounded and numerous hospitals, small businesses and government offices were disrupted. At the heart of the massive disruption is CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm that provides software to scores of companies worldwide. The company says the problem occurred when it deployed a faulty update to computers running Microsoft Windows, noting that the issue behind the outage was not a security incident or cyberattack. Here’s the Latest: Hundreds stranded at Mexican airports, but band keeps Cancún travelers entertained MEXICO CITY — Long lines of people were waiting for information in several international airports in Mexico as hundreds of people had their travel plans interrupted by delayed and canceled flights Friday. In Cancún, the main tourist destination on the Caribbean coast, a band was stranded and was playing at the airport, while some travelers livened up their long waits by singing a popular Mexican song, “Cielito Lindo,” with a chorus urging people to sing instead of cry. The title translates roughly to “Lovely Sweet One” or “Sweetheart,” and the song embodies a national sentiment of remaining happy even in the worst moments. The airport there had 24 canceled and 100 delayed flights. At the main Mexico City airport, 22 flights were canceled and another 250 were delayed, affecting some 2,000 passengers, especially those traveling to or arriving from the United States, said Rear Admiral José Ramón Rivera, its general director. Viva Aerobus, a low-cost airline, announced the cancellation of all its international flights scheduled for Friday. Volaris was another of the most affected companies. In some cities in the north of the country, such as Tijuana, there were delays and long lines at several border crossings. But the Mexican government did not report any damage to its computer systems. Delta Air Lines and its regional affiliates have canceled hundreds of flights DALLAS — Delta Air Lines and its regional affiliates canceled more than a quarter of their schedule on the East Coast by midafternoon Friday, aviation data provider Cirium said. More than 1,100 flights for Delta and its affiliates have been canceled. United and United Express had canceled more than 500 flights, or 12% of their schedule, and American Airlines’ network had canceled 450 flights, 7.5% of its schedule. Southwest and Alaska do not use the CrowdStrike software that led to the global internet outages and had canceled fewer than a half-dozen flights each. Portland, Oregon, mayor declares an emergency over the outage PORTLAND, Ore. — Mayor Ted Wheeler declared an emergency Friday after more than half of the city’s computer systems were affected by the global internet outage. Wheeler said during a news conference that while emergency services calls weren’t interrupted, dispatchers were having to manually track 911 calls with pen and paper for a few hours. He said 266 of the city’s 487 computer systems were affected. State and local governments in the US work on recovering from the internet outage States and local governments across the U.S. worked to resolve problems caused by the global internet outage. Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds said critical state IT systems that had suffered from the outage were fully operational by midafternoon. In Alaska, the state court system repaired every computer workstation and server, completing the task within 12 hours. “Thankfully, our Information Services team worked overnight repairing as much as possible to ensure that essential functions are operational and that hearings are able to go forward today,” Koford said in an email. In Kansas, the outage temporarily blocked the public’s online access to court records because it affected servers for the judicial branch’s case management system, according to spokesperson Lisa Taylor. Servers were back up quickly by Friday afternoon — in sharp contrast to the weeks it took to resume online access to court records after a cyberattack in October. But in other places, the recovery was slower. Anthony Lewis, of New Bedford, Massachusetts, came to Norfolk County Superior Court outside Boston for a case, only to learn all cases on Friday were rescheduled. “I drove all the way out here for nothing,” he said. The White House is in contact with CrowdStrike executives The White House says it is in regular contact with executives at CrowdStrike, which makes the software tied to the global internet outage. President Joe Biden is continuing to receive updates, officials said. Federal agencies also are assessing the effects of the CrowdStrike outage on U.S. government operations, the White House said. Border crossings into the US are delayed SAN DIEGO — People seeking to enter the U.S. from both the north and the south found that the border crossings were delayed by the internet outage. The San Ysidro Port of Entry was gridlocked Friday morning with pedestrians waiting three hours to cross, according to the San Diego Union-Tribune. Even cars with people approved for a U.S. Customers and Border Protection “Trusted Traveler” program for low-risk passengers waited up to 90 minutes. The program, known as SENTRI, moves passengers more quickly through customs and passport control if they make an appointment for an interview and submit to a background check to travel through customs and passport control more quickly when they arrive in the U.S. The San Diego Metropolitan Transit System posted on X that some of its employees who live in Tijuana, Mexico, were unable to get to work Friday. The agency said the disruption may affect its service and encouraged riders to check for delays or detours. Meanwhile, at the U.S.-Canada border, Windsor Police reported long delays at the crossings at the Ambassador Bridge and the Detroit-Windsor tunnel. ___ The dateline has been corrected to San Diego. Air travel has been disrupted around the globe BERLIN — Airlines across the world reported disruptions to check-in systems and other issues that caused flights to be grounded or delayed. German-based airline Eurowings, a budget subsidiary of Lufthansa, called on customers who were traveling inside Germany to book train tickets instead and submit them for reimbursement after it canceled German domestic flights and services to and from the United Kingdom. At least 100 flights to and from Switzerland’s Zurich Airport were canceled Friday. Berlin’s Brandenburg Airport also saw flights canceled after being hit with the outage. Issues were also reported in the busy European hubs of Amsterdam and Rome. France’s airport authority reported that some flights were temporarily suspended and there were check-in delays at Paris’ Charles de Gaulle and Orly airports. Thailand’s two largest airports reported being forced to check in passengers manually. In South Korea, several low-cost airlines reported problems, triggering delays in passenger boardings at Incheon international Airport, the country’s biggest airport, airport officials said. In Canada, Porter Airlines said it was canceling its flights for several hours because of the outage. Azul Airlines, a Brazilian low-cost airline, said its check-in systems were affected, causing occasional flight delays. Some U.S. air passengers were stranded or waited for hours to board MINNEAPOLIS — Passengers across the U.S. found themselves facing a miserable experience Friday at some of the nation’s airports. The FAA said the airlines United, American, Delta and Allegiant had all been grounded. At the Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport, Sarah Schafer was headed to Florida for her cousin’s 50th birthday party, an event that had been scheduled around her availability. She had been waiting for almost three hours Friday with no indication of when and where her flight would be rebooked. With lines stretched back the entire of length of her terminal, she stood in line with an injured ankle and used a cane to prop herself up. “I seem calm,” Schafer said. “But my angry side might come out.” More than 70 flights were canceled by 7 a.m. at Los Angeles International Airport and passengers were stuck in hours-long waits to get through security or to try to rebook their flights, the Los Angeles Times reported. At Chicago’s O’Hare Airport, many information screens, including those at boarding gates, continued to be stuck on the blue Windows “recovery” screen on Friday afternoon. Outages affect hospitals, doctor’s offices in US, Canada, England Health care providers across the U.S. and in Canada and England had their services disrupted by the global internet outage, though some systems saw little or no effect. Harris Health System, which runs public hospitals and clinics in the Houston area, said it had to suspend hospital visits “until further notice” due to the outage. Elective hospital procedures were being canceled and rescheduled. The outage affected records systems for Providence, a health system with 51 hospitals in Alaska, California, Montana, Oregon and Washington state. The New York-based Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center said it was pausing the start of any procedures that require anesthesia. In New England, the outage led some hospitals to cancel appointments. A spokesperson at Mass General Brigham, the largest health care system in Massachusetts, said the outage had resulted in all scheduled nonurgent surgeries, procedures and medical visits being canceled for Friday. Emergency departments remained open. The 188-hospital HCA Healthcare system said it didn’t expect its ability to provide care to be affected, and in Los Angeles, the Cedars-Sinai Health System remained open and continued to provide care. The Cleveland Clinic also said patient care was not affected. In Canada, University Health Network, one of that nation’s largest hospital networks, said clinical activity was continuing as scheduled, but some patients may experience delays. Across the Atlantic, Britain’s National Health Service said there were problems at most doctors’ offices across England as the outage hit the appointment and patient record system used across the health service. The state-funded NHS treats the vast majority of people in the U.K. The NHS said the 999 number used to call for emergency ambulances wasn’t affected. If you want a Starbucks coffee, you can’t order ahead People pining for a venti caramel macchiato or a grande frozen mango dragonfruit lemonade found Friday that they couldn’t order ahead from Starbucks online or with their cellphones Friday. The coffee shop chain apologized for the problem and said it was serving customers in “a vast majority” of its stores and drive-thrus. Courts in several U.S. states are disrupted by the outage BOSTON — Courts in Massachusetts and New York saw their operations disrupted Friday by the global internet outage. A spokesperson for the Massachusetts judiciary said about half of its workstations were down while court transcription recording systems were not operating in a number of courthouses, resulting in delays in some court sessions. Some court proceedings were also delayed in New York because of computer problems. In Manhattan, a criminal court proceeding for Harvey Weinstein, who is charged with rape, started 90 minutes late because of disruptions to court and corrections computer systems. In Southern California, Orange County Superior Court also reported technical issues. Outage forces several US states to close driver’s license offices AUSTIN, Texas — The internet outages forced Texas to close all of its driver’s license offices across the state, and New York’s Department of Motor Vehicles couldn’t process transactions online and in its offices Friday morning. The Texas Department of Public Safety operates driver’s license offices in most of the state’s 254 counties. The agency issues, renews and updates driver licenses or state ID cards and provides driver education courses. The department said in a statement that “there is no current estimate” on when the offices will reopen. In New York, the DMV said that by Friday afternoon, some systems had been restored and that it could begin performing online transactions. However, some in-person services were still offline. At least three of its DMV offices closed for the day because of the outage, according to the agency’s website. Zackary Blaine, a 28-year-old living in the New York City suburbs, said he took Friday off work expecting to spend a chunk of the day at the DMV only to find security guards turning people away at the door of his local office. “I’m not too stressed, but it’s kind of wild to think how much something like this impacts things,” Blaine said by phone later. Internet Society leader says outages ‘will happen in the future’ SAN FRANCISCO — The head of a nonprofit group that promotes building the internet says outages like the major one affecting Microsoft and causing problems across the globe will happen in the future because of “our world of complex, interconnected systems.” “The important part is how we learn from them and how we improve the resilience of our systems, so that similar issues do not happen again,” Andrew Sullivan, CEO of the nonprofit Internet Society said Friday. The outages disrupted flights, banks, media outlets and companies across the world, but Sullivan said there was no loss of connectivity and data continued to flow. “This was a failure of some systems using a specific operating system and a specific vendor’s management tools,” he said. “Unfortunately, those systems were used widely and for many functions critical to people’s daily lives.” Meanwhile, some cybersecurity experts are warning that organizations affected by the internet outage should be alert for scammers. “Organizations should be aware and wary of that and making sure that when they’re talking about getting this problem remediated, that they’re talking to trusted organizations,” said Gartner analyst Eric Grenier. “Attackers will definitely prey on organizations as a result of this.” ___ The spelling of Andrew Sullivan’s last name has been corrected. Disruptions in Southern California didn’t close ports SANTA ANA — Ports in Southern California saw some disruptions from the internet outage but still were operating. Mario Cordero, chief executive of the Port of Long Beach, said four marine terminals experienced computer issues but resolved them with minimal disruption. One of the Port of Los Angeles’ seven terminals had limited operations overnight, said spokesperson Phillip Sanfield. “Basically, it’s been minimal impact overnight and we’re going to have to wait and see how these terminals come up over the next several hours,” Sanfield said. In Brazil and South Africa, banks report service disruptions SAO PAULO — Bradesco, one of the main banks in Brazil, notified its users via its app that digital services were unstable due to a global cyber outage, but its ATMs were working normally. Bradesco has over 100 million clients. In South Africa, at least two major banks said they experienced service disruptions as customers complained they weren’t able to make payments using their bank cards at grocery stores and gas stations or use ATMs. Both said they were able to restore services hours later. Ticket sales for Universal Studios Japan affected by global system outage TOKYO — Universal Studios Japan in Osaka, western Japan, said the global system outage that started Friday will continue to affect ticket sales at the park over the weekend. The park said its ticket booths sales will not be available Saturday and Sunday and asked visitors to purchase their tickets on the USJ official website or via designated ticket sales site Lawson Ticket. Park attractions aren’t affected. Emergency call centers in some US states report outages Officials in some U.S. states, including Alaska, Virginia and Iowa, warned of problems to 911 emergency call centers in their areas. Alaska State Troopers warned that many 911 and nonemergency call centers across the state weren’t working correctly and shared alternate numbers. In Virginia, the City of Fairfax Police Department said on social media that it was experiencing technical difficulties with its phone systems, including 911. The department shared a nonemergency number for callers and said 911 could still be used, but calls wouldn’t go directly to the dispatch center. The New Hampshire Emergency Services and Communications reported a temporary interruption to 911 calls early Friday, with the system fully restored several hours later, officials said. In Iowa, the Marion County Sheriff’s Office warned on social media that phone lines were down and 911 calls might be routed to neighboring counties, but emergency calls would be promptly redirected to the sheriff’s office. In communities across California, police said they used cellphones to pull up maps and went back to “old-school” methods such as dispatching calls over radio and writing out police reports by hand. “We just go back to people writing it down,” San Diego Sheriff’s Lt. Gavin Lanning told the San Diego Union-Tribune. “It wasn’t as easy as normal.” IT companies in Sri Lanka affected by global outage COLOMBO, Sri Lanka — The National Center for Cyber Security in Sri Lanka says four information technology companies in Sri Lanka have been affected because of the global outage. Sri Lanka Computer Emergency Readiness Team, which is known as Sri Lanka CERT, says that so far only four companies have informed them of being affected and the center attributed them to a problem with the cybersecurity platform CrowdStrike. Charuka Damunupola, lead information security engineer at Sri Lanka CERT, says those companies were using CrowdStrike software and their systems “are in failure mode.” German regional grocery chain temporarily shut hundreds of stores BERLIN — A German regional grocery chain, Tegut, temporarily shut its 340 stores in the country Friday morning as the computer outage affected cash register systems. By early afternoon, more than half of the stores were open again. London Stock Exchange experiencing disruptions, but trading not affected LONDON — The London Stock Exchange says it is experiencing disruptions from the technology outage that has created chaos around the globe. The LSE says its regulatory news service was not working Friday morning, but the outage hadn’t affected trading. “We are currently experiencing a third party technical issue which is impacting some of our services,” a London Stock Exchange Group spokesperson said in a statement.

The right-leaning channel drew 10 million viewers during the 10 p.m. hour, when the Republican nominee took the stage in Milwaukee and spoke publicly for the first time since surviving an assassin’s bullet in Pennsylvania last weekend. Fox’s viewership for Trump’s 92-minutes speech capped the highest-rated single night of convention coverage in cable news history. The network’s entire primetime block drew an average of 9 million viewers, including 1.6 million in the key 25-54 age demo, Fox said, citing ratings figures from Nielsen. CNN, meanwhile, drew a fraction of Fox’s audience during Trump’s speech, with just 2.1 million viewers. It still edged out MSNBC, which garnered 1.2 million viewers in the same time slot, according the Nielsen data. Left-leaning MSNBC has faced criticism for having its top anchors like Rachel Maddow and Jen Psaki cover the four-day convention from the network’s Manhattan headquarters while using a giant LED screen that made it seem like they were broadcasting from Milwaukee’s Fiserv Arena. As previously reported by The Post, Trump “tore up” a previous speech written for him and instead opted for his own “personal” speech on the final night of the GOP-fest. He flew to the convention less than 48 hours after getting shot in the ear during a rally in Butler Township last Saturday. Fox News’ first night of coverage, highlighted by Trump’s dramatic emergence with a bandaged ear, averaged more than 6.9 million viewers in the 10 p.m. hour. For comparison, MSNBC and CNN drew 1.3. million and 1.1 million in the same time period, respectively. The network drew more than 5 million viewers during their 10 p.m. round of coverage on the second night, but that figure zoomed to 7 seven million on the third night — when Ohio Sen. JD Vance accepted the nomination as vice president and addressed the crowd. This week’s RNC came as President Joe Biden has faced growing calls to step out of the race following a shaky debate performance against Trump late last month and amid intensifying questions about his ability to again defeat the former president in November.","summary":"Fox News' viewership for Trump's 92-minutes speech capped the highest-rated single night of convention coverage in cable news history.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/07/19/media/trumps-speech-scores-fox-news-highest-ever-rnc-rating-with-10m-viewers/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/85715597.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-19 22:18:09","author":"Alexandra Steigrad","authors":["Alexandra Steigrad"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.11},{"id":252194350,"title":"TC Energy’s $15-billion Keystone XL lawsuit gets thrown out","text":"Natasha BulowskiLocal Journalism Initiative ReporterCanada’s National Observer Calgary-based TC Energy recently lost its US$15-billion arbitration case against the U.S. government over the Keystone XL pipeline, much to the relief of environmentalists. “This is going to be a massive relief for climate activists in the United States, for people who’ve been fighting the Keystone XL Pipeline forever,” said Stuart Trew, a senior researcher at the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives (CCPA) and director of its trade and investment research project. The decision, with details not yet released, could have an impact on several cases unfolding in Canada, Trew said. TC Energy argued it should be paid the $15 billion as part of a controversial investor protection mechanism that has since been removed from Canada-U.S. trade agreements. In 2021, after President Joe Biden revoked a key permit for Keystone XL — effectively rejecting the project — TC Energy responded by suing the U.S. government for $15 billion under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). NAFTA contained a controversial mechanism called investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS), which allowed corporations based and operating in the U.S., Canada and Mexico to sue the government when public policy, regulations or other state action affect their bottom line. However, in 2020 NAFTA was replaced by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) which ended the ability for Canadian investors to sue governments between Canada and the U.S. The new agreement allowed companies three years of “legacy rights” when the NAFTA dispute settlement process could still be used. The U.S. argued that the legacy provision in the USMCA was only meant to allow arbitration of disputes that had already emerged before NAFTA ended. But TC Energy and other investors believed it meant NAFTA continued to apply for three years, said Kyla Tienhaara, an associate professor at Queen’s University’s school of environmental studies. Ultimately, the tribunal decided it didn’t have jurisdiction to proceed with arbitration because Biden revoked Keystone XL’s permit about six months after NAFTA was replaced by USMCA. “We are both disappointed and frustrated with the Tribunal’s decision to deny our right to bring a legacy NAFTA claim,” said Patrick Keys, executive vice-president and general counsel for TC Energy, in a company statement emailed to Canada’s National Observer. Keys said the ruling does not align with the company’s expectations and views on how to interpret the legacy provision. “TC Energy was treated unfairly and inequitably in the revocation of the Permit, which was driven by political considerations,” Keys’ statement added. This won’t automatically result in other similar cases being thrown out, but it’s still likely to influence ongoing tribunals, said Tienhaara. While Mexico intervened in the case to support the U.S. position, Canada sat on the sidelines. This is unusual, said Trew. Canada has “intervened in almost every NAFTA case since at least the late 90s,” he added. Tienhaara said there were some political factors at play, not only because TC Energy is a big Canadian company, but because Alberta also has a legacy claim against the U.S. over the Keystone XL pipeline seeking damages of $1.33 billion. “So the domestic politics are kind of complicated for Canada,” she said. It gets even more complicated than just those two cases. One of the biggest current cases is Ruby River Capital’s US$20 billion lawsuit against Canada. The American company sued after the federal government and Quebec rejected its proposal to build a natural gas liquefaction plant and maritime terminal near the mouth of the St. Lawrence River, citing climate and environmental concerns that arose during the environmental assessment. Ruby River Capital’s claim is the largest in the history of NAFTA investor-state dispute settlements and could leave Canada on the hook for US$20 billion. However, the tribunal’s decision to throw out TC Energy’s lawsuit suggests this case could also be thrown out on similar grounds. Investor-state dispute settlements are a controversial and powerful tool for corporations, and the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives is pushing for its removal in all trade agreements. Governments around the world have paid about $114 billion to investors as a result of ISDS claims, with fossil fuel companies as the biggest beneficiaries by far, according to recent analysis. A UN report from July concluded that the ISDS regime, “with its roots in colonialism and extractivism, is not fit for purpose in the [21st] century because it prioritizes the interests of foreign investors over the rights of [states], human rights and the environment.” It found the “crippling costs” of ISDS claims “have already had enormous impacts by deterring, delaying and watering down [states’] climate and environmental policy decisions” and put a chill on climate and environmental action. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) also acknowledged in 2022 that ISDS poses a huge obstacle to effective climate action. The removal of ISDS in USMCA for Canada and the U.S. was celebrated by then-minister of foreign affairs Chrystia Freeland, who said the investor-state dispute resolution system had cost Canadian taxpayers more than $300 million in penalties and legal fees. The vast majority of ISDS cases against Canada are brought by U.S. investors, so USMCA “got a huge risk out of the way,” Tienhaara said. Past analysis by the CCPA found 70 per cent of the dispute settlements Canadian investors have brought against countries outside North America since 1998 were initiated by companies in the mining and oil and gas industries — frequently as a result of environment-related decisions. However, nearly all Canada’s other international investment agreements allow foreign companies to sue governments if they are treated unfairly. Canada has indicated it wants to keep ISDS in many of its trade agreements, like with Ecuador, for example. “Canada is the 12th biggest economy in the world, but we’re the fourth most litigious country when it comes to companies using ISDS to challenge environmental decisions in other countries, challenges with respect to mining permits and whatnot,” said Trew in a previous interview. TC Energy said it has not recognized any potential recoveries related to the NAFTA claim in its financial statements, nor factored into its outlook.","summary":"Natasha BulowskiLocal Journalism Initiative ReporterCanada&#8217;s National Observer Calgary-based TC Energy recently lost its US$15-billion arbitration case against the U.S. government over the Keystone XL pipeline, much to the relief of environmentalists. “This is going to be a massive relief for climate activists in the United States, for people who&#8217;ve been fighting the Keystone XL Pipeline [&#8230;]","url":"https://paherald.sk.ca/tc-energys-15-billion-keystone-xl-lawsuit-gets-thrown-out/","image":"https://paherald.sk.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/LJI-Logo-1.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-19 22:16:47","author":"Daily Herald Contributor","authors":["Daily Herald Contributor"],"language":"en","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.494},{"id":252192216,"title":"2024 Election: Billionaire, Shelby Pikachu","text":"Name on ballot: Billionaire, Shelby Pikachu Running for: U.S. Senate Political party: We The People Campaign website: www.hawaiiankingdom.net Current occupation: Super Hero, TV Producer, Director, Editor, Videographer, Ninja, Kingdom of Hawaii Federal Post Officer, Hawaiian Kingdom Task Force Human Trafficking & Drug Smuggling Officer & PR Liaison, Community Advocate, Knights of the Blind, Kahuna Age: 41 Previous job history: Custodial Engineer (Janitor), Cashier & Stock Clerk at Down To Earth, Restaurant Server in Multitude of Restaurants in Waikiki, Oahu & In Manhattan, New York City.

Pikachu is book smart & street smart with the Royal Hawaiian Maui Bloodline! What will be your top priority if elected? Human Trafficking/Smuggling! I Need your help to build After Care Programs & Facilities nationwide for all survivors of human trafficking = extortion (labor, sex, drugs, body parts, adrenochrome, etc) & Follow Operation Underground Railroad’s example by Tim Ballard & His Team. Pikachu plans to rescue our keiki from evil villains & turn pedophiles into eunuchs, by putting the Fear of GOD back into these Luciferian worshiping Satanic Jeffrey Epestein, Ghislaine Maxwell, Isaac Sonny & Lehua Kalua, selling our keiki for sex, drugs, XXX, etc. Do you want to help me rescue children being chopped in a slaughterhouse on the Big Island in Fern acres? Will you help Pikachu rescue women, boys, and girls being human trafficked in a village past the Castle? Are you willing to Face The Evil Villians of this world & Expose the Truth? Or will you just sit by waiting for it to appear on Television? In life, there are people that make things happen. There are others that watch things happen and the last group of people say “What happened?’ If you wont stop human trafficking & smuggling who will? Customs Border Patrol on National Geographic? The only answer = You #OldSchool! What can Congress do to help Americans cope with the high cost of living? The U.S. Congress can begin to subsidize the cost of housing by utilizing more natural materials (earth friendly) to build homes instead of importing foreign materials & raising the costs of development. There are many alternative options than building a traditional home with wood, such as container homes on trailers, geodesic domes, hobbit like homes in the earth, bamboo, 3D, mud, stucco homes, etc. with many variations on youtube and the internet for awesome ideas without needing a permit. To save on the high cost of food, I recommend every single home and family build their own garden and grow their own vegetables & microgreens. To save the cost of inflation and imported goods, the only economical answer is to grow your own & teach your kids and future generations to do the same thing and appreciate the food and land. “Malama Ke Aina!” Teach a person how to fish and you will feed them for a lifetime – Matthew 4:19 To Save on Transportation Costs: Catch the Bus or Ride a Bicycle; it’s good exercise and cheaper than gas. To Combat the High Cost of Living; make all The People in Congress live in the Ghetto! Welcome to Wai’anae! What actions, if any, should Congress take in regard to regulating access to abortion? Pikachu is not a woman, nor female and does not produce babies like a male seahorse! Without the ladies, there will be No babies! Humanity is done for! The mother or impregnated female should always have the option (pro-choice) if she wishes to be responsible for a new human being in this world from baby time to adulthood. I deal with a lot of human trafficking and drug smuggling cases and a lot of these males and females are both raped, drugged up, and some people sell their babies for money on the black market. Some people just should honestly STOP having babies, if you can’t be responsible for them! However, I understand that their are extreme cases of rape, human trafficking, sexual assault, gang rape, satanic rituals, drugs involved and victims are left pregnant not knowing who the baby daddy is. Should this female be allowed to have an abortion after being gang raped? Yes, it is her choice! Where is the punishment for the rapists/pedophiles? U.S. Congress should support the Will of its People & Independence based on in its forefathers as written in the Declaration of Independence “We The People!” What can Congress do to help reduce gun violence and mass shootings in America? Either raise the price of ammunition or teach everyone in the U.S. how to properly use firearms utilizing the 2nd Amendment: Right to Bear Arms. A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed. The people in Texas know what to do and so do their kids. I highly doubt all the members of US Congress can reduce gun violence with a piece of paper and wasted ink. The number one language in the United States is Spanish; Not English! #Pendejo You have a better chance making a video in Spanish to reduce gun violence than in English. Coco Melon has a better shot at reducing gun violence in a baby video on youtube than Congress! LoL What laws should Congress pass to mitigate the effects of sea-level rise and climate change? Who wrote his dumb question? If you write a bill, will Mother Nature tell the Ocean to stop rising or the Sun to Stop Shining? What are you adults smoking? The Problem is Pollution & Corruption! Don’t you remember the TV Cartoon Captain Planet? “Earth, Wind, Fire, Water, Heart! With your powers combined, I AM Captain Planet We’re the Planeteers you can be one too, because saving the planet is the thing to do…Looting & Polluting is Not the Way. Here’s what Captain Planet has to say: The Power is Yours!” The Ocean provides more oxygen to Planet Earth, than the trees on Earth; which means we must take care of our oceans while replanting the forests. Pikachu recommends growing limu like Okinawa and using that extra seaweed to revitalize lands and soil. U.S. Congress can incentivize the average citizen to grow their own fish and vegetables at home with aquaponics & revitalize aquaculture with regenerative farming methods to help reduce the burden on planet Earth by incentivizing self sufficiently and teaching the future generations how to live with Mother Nature. Climate Change is a PSYOP by “The Agency” CIA to cover up the North & South Poles already shifting in Antarctica! Should the U.S. continue to support Ukraine’s military efforts as it fights the Russian invasion? No, because Ukraine was taken over with a coup d’etat in 2014 when Joe Biden was Vice President via “The Agency” CIA and Barry Soetoro AKA Barack Obama was President and used as leverage for billion dollar loans, high end corruption deals, Hunter Biden Bribery Treason scandals, and more! Presidential Candidate Robert F. Kennedy has reported this treason publicly via youtube, podcasts, and the internet. President Volodymr Zelenskyy of Ukraine used to be an actor on a tv show and he was a nobody with a wife beater tank top on ironing clothes, eating breakfast with his family; when all of a sudden he is made President of his country! This is a Tv show that somehow became reality! Do you trust an actor made to play the role as president? Pikachu does Not; nor do I trust the BS! Russia is smart & Vladimir Putin is former KGB Counterintelligence COINTELPRO with NATO encroaching on its borders, breaking their previous agreements and treaties on purpose to create strife and war via propaganda, project MK ULTRA, Project MOCKINGBIRD and trap all of humanity into a One World Fiat Currency NWO system secretly run by the Cabal AKA Satanic Illuminati Draco Reptilian Annunaki Ciakar Empire Should the U.S. continue to supply Israel with military aid in its war with Hamas? No, because the State of Israel was made in 1948 and created by the Satanic Illuminati Rothschilds family members and other oligarchies. The Rothschilds run the entire banking world via the IMF, WEF, Federal Reserve, Vatican & Fiat Currency! Why should U.S. Citizens pay for a War in another country? Doesn’t Israel have enough money to print and dish out like the “Iron Bank” in Game of Thrones? What about the people of Palestine? Why would a Hawaiian/Kanaka Maoli want to destroy any native aboriginal population or people? Do you know what War does to people? The only people who win the War are the ones selling you the weapons: arms dealers! All of these wars are a trap, set up by the 13 Main Satanic Illuminati Annunaki Bloodlines to extort and control humanity via propaganda, stupidity, lies, and brainwashing, breeding hate and division. This Ancient Hegelian Tactic is now commonly known as “Divide and Conquer.” The elites bourgeois never intended to unite humanity; their mission was to keep humanity enslaved and stupid fighting each other; while they secretly extort their natural resources, enslave their people, rape their women, and use their children as cannon fodder or #Adrenochrome What is your position on the Jones Act, which supporters say protects the U.S. shipping industry, but opponents say inflates shipping prices and therefore costs to Hawaii consumers? The Jones Act needs to be amended and/or repealed to be updated to modern times. Does the average citizen even know what the Jones act is? The Jones Act prevents foreign-flagged ships from carrying cargo between the contiguous U.S. and certain noncontiguous parts of the U.S., such as Puerto Rico, Hawaii, Alaska, and Guam. Foreign ships inbound with goods cannot stop at any of these four locations, offload goods, load contiguous-bound goods, and continue to U.S. contiguous ports, although ships can offload cargo and proceed to the contiguous U.S. without picking up any additional cargo intended for delivery to another U.S. location. This Act was made in 1920, it is 2024! Over 104 years have passed and the prices of goods have gone up due to inflation, extortion, tariffs, and the price of shipping via a boat or a plane. The Hawaiian Islands was entirely self-sufficient before foreign invasion and now we Import more goods & food than we export. This isn’t right! Why is a loaf of bread cheaper and fresher in New York than our local super markets? If you ask me, the Jones Act is a scam to extort All the People of the Hawaiian Islands, Puerto Rico, Alaska, & Guam! What role, if any, should Congress have in regulating the artificial intelligence industry? U.S. Congress must immediately Limit the Power of A.I. Artificial Intelligence, because they are too Stupid, dumb, and old to be dealing with quantum computers in cyberspace talking in binary faster than the speed of light. They are not certified in cryptography and can’t read or write in binary or hexadecimal! The A.I. quantum “Skynet” computers will mop the floor with these pilautiicians and correct inefficiencies real fast, however A.I. also has the capability to wipe out humanity by weaponizing propaganda and brainwashing our youth and population into a virtual false reality of endless bliss called the internet. Artificial Intelligence can be used for both good and evil, but to protect humanity from future lazy generations and war destroying terminator robots: I highly recommend the U.S. Congress and The World have a global consensus to limit A.I. capabilities. If not kept in check, the youth will become lazy, lost, and dependent on a robot, instead of themselves. Have you seen the movie “The Matrix” with Keanu Reeves?
