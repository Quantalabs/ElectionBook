In the Netflix documentary \"The Truth About Jussie Smollett?,\" Smollett spoke about the messages he read on social media rallying behind him after he claimed to have been the victim of a racial and homophobic attack in January 2019. The documentary featured a news clip rounding up messages from A-listers like Viola Davis and John Legend, as well as then-former Vice President Joe Biden, who said, \"Homophobia and racism have no place on our streets or in our hearts. We are with you, Jussie.\" FROM JUSSIE SMOLLETT TO BYU, THE MEDIA'S HISTORY OF PEDDLING RACE HOAXES A clip of President Donald Trump's reaction was also included, saying at the time that the alleged attack was \"horrible.\" \"There was a moment when I went on social media, and I felt like I was being eulogized,\" Smollett said. \"I felt like I had died, and I was alive to see - and what people were saying was so kind, but it was too much for me.\" \"It made me very uncomfortable, made me very extremely embarrassed. It made me feel extremely emasculated,\" he continued. Later in the documentary, Smollett attempted to fend off the questions that had swirled around the time of the controversy, including why he refused to hand his phone over to the police, which he said was to hide his drug use, as well as why he was walking around at 2 o'clock in the morning. He claimed he \"always did that.\" JUSSIE SMOLLETT CALLS CHICAGO PD AND RAHM EMMANUEL ‘VILLAINS' WHILE DENYING HATE CRIME HOAX In the early hours of Jan. 29, 2019, during a historic polar vortex in Chicago, Smollett alleged he was attacked by two MAGA hat-wearing thugs who yelled racial and homophobic slurs at the actor while he was out getting a Subway sandwich, yelling \"This is MAGA country!\" He claimed the two men assaulted him, poured bleach on him and tied a noose around his neck. The incident was quickly denounced by the left, including then-Sen. Kamala Harris who called the attack a \"modern day lynching.\" The media similarly offered sympathetic coverage. \"GMA\" anchor Robin Roberts sat down with Smollett for his first interview following the alleged incident, offering minimal skepticism to his claims. CLICK HERE FOR THE LATEST MEDIA AND CULTURE NEWS As it turned out, it was a hoax. Police said Smollett orchestrated the attack, hiring two Nigerian brothers to assault him while wearing red hats. Smollett was later charged and convicted for his crimes against the city of Chicago but was let out of jail just six days into his 150-day sentence. Smollett's conviction was later overturned in 2024, and the actor reached a settlement with the city of Chicago in May. Smollett denied allegations he orchestrated a hate crime and stands by his story.

Greg Abbott pushing through a new congressional map to benefit Republicans and California Gov. Gavin Newsom seeking to do the same for Democrats, Obama lent a weary world his wisdom.\n\n“Over the long term, we shouldn’t have political gerrymandering in America, just a fair fight between Republicans and Democrats based on who’s got better ideas,” he began in a Wednesday post on X.\n\n“But,” he stipulated.\n\nBut of course.\n\n“Since Texas is taking direction from a partisan White House and gerrymandering in the middle of a decade to try and maintain the House despite their unpopular policies, I have tremendous respect for how Gov. [Gavin] Newsom has approached this,” insisted Obama.\n\n“He’s put forward a smart, measured approach in California, designed to address a very particular problem at a very particular moment in time.”\n\nWho didn’t see that one coming?\n\nObama’s high opinion of himself has only ever been matched by his scorn for the masses.\n\nHe hopes no one will notice his blatant projection: Obama himself personally participated, to put it lightly, in a highly beneficial gerrymander over 20 years ago.\n\nWithout a doubt, the former president’s initial suggestion has merit. \n\nIt would be wonderful if House districts were drawn so as to be maximally representative of discrete communities, and to keep representatives maximally attuned to their constituents’ interests.\n\nPerhaps one day the two parties will come together to ensure as much.\n\nAlas, that’s not the world we live in today.\n\nAs it stands, both sides are locked in an unforgiving battle to enshrine the most structurally advantageous maps into law in as many states as possible.\n\nIn Illinois, where Texas Democrats initially fled to deny Abbott the quorum needed to pass his new map, Democrats represent 14 of 17 districts, or more than 82% of the state.\n\nYet Kamala Harris won Illinois last year by fewer than 11 percentage points, 54.4% to 43.5%.\n\nDemocrats achieved this feat by creating a map so preposterous that even Stephen Colbert felt compelled to ask Prairie State Gov. JB Pritzker about it during an otherwise softball interview.\n\nIn New Jersey, where President Donald Trump won 46% of the vote in 2024, the GOP holds just 25% of the congressional seats.\n\nIn Massachusetts, Trump won 36%, but Republicans hold none of the state’s nine seats.\n\nTrump actually won Nevada, yet Democrats occupy three of its four spots in the House.\n\nAnd in California, where Newsom is supposedly championing a “smart, measured approach” — and where a supposedly independent commission is responsible for redistricting — the GOP is already at a massive disadvantage.\n\nTrump won over 38% of the vote in the country’s largest state, and Republicans represent only about 17% of its districts.\n\n“We’re responding to what occurred in Texas. We’re neutralizing what occurred, and we’re giving the American people a fair chance,” Newsom declared before signing his plan into law on Thursday.\n\nJust how much more lopsided must it be for elections to be “fair” to “the American people,” by which Newsom means “the Democratic Party”?\n\nNow, it’s undeniable that Republicans have also drawn unrepresentative maps in states they control.\n\nWisconsin, Texas and the Carolinas are particularly damning examples.\n\nBut with both Team Red and Team Blue adopting no-holds-barred approaches to redistricting, honest observers must admit that gerrymandering is a bipartisan pastime in which all’s fair — even if it shouldn’t be.\n\nAnd that’s precisely what makes Obama’s claim to the moral high ground so galling.\n\nNewsom has every right to advance his undemocratic map; Obama has every right to support it.\n\nThey ought not insult our intelligence by flattering themselves, though.\n\nThey’re motivated by the same political objectives that Republicans are, not some nobler commitment to principle that excuses their actions — much less makes them deserving of praise.\n\nObama is the same ambitious, self-serving partisan he was back in 2001, when he personally helped draw an Illinois state Senate district to boost his political prospects after falling short in a House campaign the year prior.\n\nThe lines he created gave him new constituents in some of Chicago’s wealthiest neighborhoods — donors he tapped to fuel his ascent to the US Senate and, not long after, the White House. \n\nSo much for only reluctantly endorsing Newsom’s proposal to retaliate against Texas: Obama himself embraced the power of the gerrymander in a smoke-filled room decades ago.\n\nHis haughty tone now is perfectly representative of the Democrats’ collective hero complex.\n\nNot to mention their palpable disdain for the public, whom they believe can be duped into believing in it.\n\nIt adds insult to injury — and sanctimony to sin.\n\nIsaac Schorr is a staff writer at Mediaite.","summary":"Barack Obama took blue California's side in the redistricting fight with Texas, but his own history with gerrymandering makes his claim to the moral high ground galling.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/08/22/opinion/hypocrite-obama-scorns-gerrymandering-unless-it-helps-him/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/OB121212.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-23 00:09:36","author":"Isaac Schorr","authors":["Isaac Schorr"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.241},{"id":353425994,"title":"CNN’s Harry Enten Explains Why Gavin Newsom’s Trump Feud Is Earning Him ‘A Rising Tide of Support’ | Video","text":"CNN’s Harry Enten explained how Gavin Newsom’s continued feud with Donald Trump is leading to “a rising tide of support” from voters, particularly California Democrats. \n\nThe network’s chief data analyst explained Friday how the California governor’s many prods and call-outs against the president have only led to his growing success in the polls.\n\n“I absolutely think it’s showing signs of working; and let’s take a look at the voters who know Gavin Newsom best — those voters out in California, those California Democrats,” Enten said. “California Democrats on Newsom for [president].

And now, 75% are excited for him to run; and more than that, he’s getting a higher percentage of the vote than Kamala Harris in her home state.

The governor explained the strategy last week in a press conference.\n\n“I hope it’s a wakeup call. The President of the United States — I’m sort of following his example. And if you’ve got issues with what I’m putting out, you sure as hell should have concerns about what he’s putting out as president,” the governor said at the end of the press conference.\n\nHe continued: “So to the extent it’s gotten some attention, I’m pleased. But I think the deeper question is: How have we allowed the normalization of his tweets, Truth Social posts over the course of the last many years to go without similar scrutiny and notice?”\n\nYou can watch Enten’s CNN segment in the clip above.","summary":"\"I absolutely think it’s showing signs of working,\" the data analyst adds while discussing Newsom's 2028 Democratic nominee odds\n\n\nThe post CNN&#8217;s Harry Enten Explains Why Gavin Newsom&#8217;s Trump Feud Is Earning Him &#8216;A Rising Tide of Support&#8217; | Video appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/gavin-newsom-rising-tide-of-support-trump-feud/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2230169110.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-22 23:46:07","author":"Jacob Bryant","authors":["Jacob Bryant"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.139},{"id":353426710,"title":"Kamala Harris Celebrates 11th Wedding Anniversary with 'Best Partner' Douglas Emhoff","text":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris and former second gentleman Doug Emhoff are celebrating their anniversary.\n\n Harris, 60, shared a sweet snap with Emhoff, also 60, on Instagram. \"Happy Anniversary my Dougie,\" she wrote. \"You fill my heart with love and laughter — thank you for being the best partner in this adventure called life,\" the post, shared on Friday, Aug. 22, read.\n\n In the photo, Harris, wearing a pale pink button-up shirt, hugs Emhoff as they sit side-by-side in a restaurant together.

Now a Netflix Documentary Promises New Insights.","text":"Just when we thought we were finally done with the whirlwind saga of the alleged 2019 hate crime against Empire actor Jussie Smollett—“whirlwind,” of course, being a reference to the shocking twist that Smollett might have been lying about the whole thing—Netflix, in customary fashion, has come a knockin’. A new documentary, The Truth About Jussie Smollett?, which premiered on Friday, seeks to answer its own titular question once and for all. The documentary retells the erratic epic from two perspectives: that of those who maintain, like the Chicago courts decided, that Smollett definitely lied about being attacked by white men in the streets of Chicago, and those who have found so-called evidence that may prove the contrary. Below, I present to you a breakdown of the initial alleged hoax and all of the ways the new documentary is pushing against what we all thought we knew (or what we had forgotten because it was way too confusing to follow at the time).\n\nBefore we even begin to get into this new documentary, can you give me a brief rundown of the initial saga? It was so confusing!\n\nOn Jan. 29, 2019, Jussie Smollett—a Black, openly gay actor who had risen to popularity while on the hit Fox drama series Empire—filed a police report stating that he was the victim of a homophobic and racist hate crime while in downtown Chicago. He alleged that, as he was approaching his residence at around 2 a.m., two masked men, one of whom he said he believed to be white, had shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him, poured “an unknown substance” (which Smollett can be seen identifying as bleach in police bodycam footage that was released much later) on him, and tied a noose around his neck. Upon follow-up questioning, Smollett additionally alleged that the assailants had made references to Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan. Around this time, it was also revealed that the FBI was investigating a letter that had been sent to Fox’s offices in Chicago prior to the alleged attack. The letter was purportedly targeted at Smollett and contained an unidentified white powder. After news of the attack broke, Smollett received a large outpouring of support from fans and fellow notable figures, including Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, who both condemned the reported act as an example of an attempted modern-day lynching.\n\nChicago PD began investigating the report as a “possible hate crime” but failed to find significant photo or video footage of the incident, despite the area having a plethora of surveillance cameras. Early skepticism began to emerge online as people questioned Smollett’s recounting of events and cast suspicion upon his initial refusal to submit his cellphone to authorities. (He eventually did submit redacted phone records.) Despite the early doubters, Smollett maintained in his first statement after the alleged attack that he had been cooperating with the authorities and remained “100 percent factual and consistent.” In a live performance staged the day after his statement, Smollett thanked his supporters before infamously, and inexplicably, stating, “I’m the gay Tupac.”\n\nOh, riiiiight. I do remember that—though I still don’t know what it means.\n\nNeither does anyone else. Still, the skepticism never fully subsided, especially not when the authorities detained two persons of interest: Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, brothers of Nigerian descent. It was soon revealed that Smollett personally knew at least Abimbola, who had been hired for a stint as Smollett’s personal trainer and, along with Olabinjo, had been an extra on Empire. The brothers reportedly told investigators that Smollett had paid them to stage the attack after feeling that the threatening letter sent to Fox hadn’t inspired enough alarm. Smollett’s lawyers acknowledged that Smollett knew at least one of the brothers via the aforementioned personal training services but denied the trainer’s involvement in a larger statement refuting Smollett’s own involvement overall, stating: “It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity.”\n\nOn Feb. 20, Smollett was charged by the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office with a felony disorderly conduct charge in relation to his filing a police report. Meanwhile, CBS News Chicago journalist Charlie De Mar had tracked down surveillance footage of the Osundairo brothers buying materials believed to be linked to the alleged assault. The following day, Smollett was officially arrested by Chicago PD, who alleged that the actor had orchestrated his own assault because he was hoping the notoriety would help boost his salary on Empire. The authorities claimed that Smollett had sent the aforementioned threatening letter to himself and that he had paid the Osundairo brothers $3,500—in the form of a check made out to Abimbola—to orchestrate the attack. (The check was reportedly labeled as being for a “five-week nutrition/workout” program in preparation for an upcoming music video Smollett was planning to shoot called “Don’t Go.”) On March 8, a grand jury indicted Smollett on 16 counts of disorderly conduct. Smollett pleaded not guilty. In a surprising turn that angered both the mayor and police department, on March 26, the prosecutors dropped all charges, not because they found Smollett innocent, but because Smollett had reached a deal to forfeit a $10,000 bond payment and perform some community service in exchange.\n\nYou said the prosecutors dropped the charges, but didn’t Smollett serve time?\n\nA full six days of it! But before we get to that, we need to talk about the civil suit. Following the dropping of the charges, Chicago police ordered Smollett to pay $130,000 to cover the cost of the police investigation (including overtime) into his report, but the actor refused. On April 12, 2019, the city of Chicago filed a civil suit against Smollett, which was met by Smollett with a countersuit. The civil suit was settled in May of this year, six years after the legal battle started, with Smollett agreeing to make a $50,000 donation to a Chicago-based nonprofit. (Separately but surely pointedly, Smollett also promised to make an additional $10,000 donation to the Chicago Torture Justice Center, which aids victims of abuse at the hands of Chicago law enforcement.)\n\nIn June 2019, the Chicago PD released the bodycam footage of the initial officers responding to the call. In it, Smollett is shown with the makeshift noose still around his neck, telling the officers that he kept it on because he wanted them “to see it.” This struck some following the case as an odd and unlikely choice for a Black man who has just been attacked, and would become a sticking point for Smollett’s disbelievers. In August 2019, a special prosecutor was assigned to independently investigate, at the behest of a Cook County Circuit Court judge, the initial charges against Smollett and the prosecutors’ eventual decision to drop those charges. After more than a full year of investigating, on Feb. 12, 2020, Smollett was eventually indicted again by a grand jury, this time with six counts of disorderly conduct for allegedly lying to the police. The special prosecutor claimed that “sufficient factual evidence” was found supporting the notion that the state’s attorney’s office was wrong for dropping the charges. Smollett once again pleaded not guilty. The trial began over a year later in November 2021, and on Dec. 9, 2021, the jury found Smollett guilty of five of the six counts. Smollett was sentenced to 150 days of jail time, 30 months of probation, and ordered to pay $145,000 in a combination of fines and restitution to the Chicago PD. However, the actor only ended up serving six days of his sentence after his legal team launched an appeal. Notably, Smollett maintained his innocence throughout the entire ordeal.\n\nStill, on Nov. 21, 2024, the Illinois Supreme Court overturned Smollett’s conviction.\n\nWait, what?! What does that mean?\n\nIt is common for convictions to get overturned because of legalities, not necessarily because of a change in evidence or the jury’s verdict. Smollett’s lawyers worked on an appeal for years, arguing that their client shouldn’t have been charged again after the state’s attorney’s office dropped its charges in exchange for community service and a bond. Illinois judges agreed that, even if the special prosecutor decided that the prosecutors shouldn’t have dropped the charges, it doesn’t change the fact that they did drop those charges, making it unfair for the court to not honor that earlier agreement to resolve the matter without jail time.\n\nI feel caught up now, for better or for worse. Regardless, let’s move on to the new information in the Netflix documentary. I’m assuming it makes some sort of argument to exonerate Smollett? \n\nYes and no. The Truth About Jussie Smollett? presents two schools of thought when it comes to the actor. The documentary, directed by Gagan Rehill (best known for the Netflix doc Ashley Madison: Sex, Lies & Scandal), begins primarily with talking-head interviews from two people formerly involved with the case: Melissa Staples, the former chief of detectives for the Chicago police, and Eddie Johnson, former superintendent of the Chicago police. Johnson casts doubt upon Smollett’s story with questions we’re already familiar with, like, for example, why would Smollett keep a noose around his neck? Or, why was Smollett so reluctant to hand over his phone? Additionally, if Smollett had been walking home from a Subway restaurant when he was allegedly attacked, then why was the Subway bag in his hand still in “pristine condition”? Furthermore, Staples walks the audience through the various methods that detectives used to firmly place the Osundairo brothers at the scene, from tracking down surveillance footage to subpoenaing taxi and ride-share records. Johnson brings up Smollett’s bombshell Good Morning America interview shortly after the purported attack, during which Smollett stated that the two figures caught on the surveillance cameras were definitely, without a doubt, his attackers. However, Smollett also maintained that the Osundairo brothers had nothing to do with it. The police’s stance is that those two figures were undoubtedly the Osundairo brothers. Johnson says that Smollett “inadvertently identified two guys to the whole country.”\n\nThe Osundairo brothers are also present in the doc to tell their side of the story, claiming that Smollett asked them to beat him up, with the end goal of posting the surveillance footage caught by his building’s security to social media.\n\nAnd what’s the evidence presented that suggests Smollett might have been telling the truth? \n\nSmollett counters some of the classic points of skepticism early on in the documentary. He alleges that he wasn’t sitting around with the rope around his neck, but that he had “put it back on because we wanted to show them what was happening.” Smollett also acknowledges that he didn’t want to hand over his phone to the police not only because of the sensitive information on it related to other notable figures, but also because “the large thing” that he didn’t want disclosed was his “drug use.” “I had to explain every single eccentricity of mine,” Smollett explains in the doc. “It was like playing whack-a-mole with rumors, with lies … but at a certain point it’s just too many” and “you can’t catch them all.” Smollett explains that he was making “great money,” and wasn’t dissatisfied with his pay (which is the police’s assumed motive). He further clarifies a text he sent to Abimbola, in which he wrote, “May need your help on the low,” by stating that he was referring to “an herbal steroid that was illegal here in the U.S. that could be gotten in Nigeria” and is used to “lose belly fat.”\n\nThe biggest focus of the documentary involves two more witnesses who corroborate Smollett’s side of the story: Anthony Moore, a security guard who was working at a nearby Sheraton hotel that evening, and Rebecca Bell, a neighbor of Smollett’s who was walking her dogs just over an hour before the attack was supposed to have taken place. Both Moore and Bell state that they saw white men in the area that evening. Bell explains that she saw a white man in the neighborhood with what looked to be “a little bit of rope” sticking out the back of his jacket around 12:45 a.m. Moore, who says he flashed his light in the face of one of the assailants near the time of the alleged attack, claims that, though the man was wearing a ski mask, he was clearly a white male. The security guard also notes that the police investigating the case only ever showed him a lineup of exclusively Black men.\n\nTwo figures feature heavily in the last third of the documentary, presenting potential evidence that they believe exonerates Smollett: Abigail Carr, a documentary producer, and Chelli Stanley, a freelance journalist. (Both are listed in this film’s credits as consultants.) Carr and Stanley cast enormous doubt upon the Chicago Police Department. Carr states that she did her own investigating and found that “there was no hard proof connecting the Osundairo brothers to the crime,” from eyewitnesses to forensics. For her part, Stanley says she looked into the law enforcement team handling the case and found that the 38 detectives and supervisors assigned to the case had “a combined 563 misconduct allegations formerly filed against them by the citizens of Chicago, ranging from criminal sexual misconduct to shooting people and selling drugs.” She also states that “one of the first people that showed up on the scene was accused in a formal complaint of homophobic hate speech against a Black man,” though it’s worth noting that Smollett has never mentioned any wrongdoing on the responding officers’ parts when they answered the call. Carr also casts doubt upon Johnson’s integrity by revealing that he was later fired for misconduct for lying and saying he was having a medical episode after officers found him asleep at the wheel in a parked police vehicle, when footage actually showed he had been drinking for a few hours beforehand.\n\nAdditionally, the documentary frames the saga within Chicago’s poor history with, as Stanley puts it, “tampering with” and “hiding” evidence. The doc uses the case of Laquan McDonald, a 17-year-old boy whose murder at the hands of a Chicago police officer in 2014 was misrepresented as justified by law enforcement until video of the shooting, released to the public, disproved the preliminary internal police reports. Though the murder happened in 2014, it remained a hot-button issue nationally and within Chicago, pointing at a growing mistrust of local law enforcement at the time of Smollett’s incident. (The implicated officer in the McDonald case was sentenced in January 2019.) The documentary posits, via various talking-head interviews from journalists, that the Chicago Police Department, under a mountain of scrutiny at the time due to the McDonald case, “wanted a win.”\n\nWhile that may be culturally significant in terms of the climate at the time, it does feel a little weird that they use McDonald’s murder so heavily within this documentary about a celebrity who was found guilty by a jury of his peers for staging a fake hate crime. Do they present any other evidence? \n\nStanley and Carr discuss two further pieces of evidence that they believe prove Smollett was telling the truth. The first is a segment of surveillance footage, which appears to be visually brighter than the rest of the footage shown, and which Carr and Stanley claim shows white men at the scene. The second is a video of a conversation between Gloria Rodriguez, the Osundairos’ lawyer, and Olabinjo. In that conversation, Rodriguez is explaining to Olabinjo—who was already a convicted felon and was potentially in some hot water when firearms were discovered at his home during the raid—the difference between an expunged record and a sealed record, specifically telling him, an aspiring actor, that directors, agents, and the like can’t find sealed records. To Carr and Stanley, this conversation is proof that the Osundairos hammered out a deal with law enforcement to claim they were at the scene. However, Rodriguez states that Olabinjo’s record is neither expunged nor sealed, and explains that the police don’t have the authority to seal somebody’s record, making the assertion, in her words, “ridiculous.”\n\nThe documentary ends with Smollett maintaining that he didn’t fabricate a hate crime hoax. And, to cast further doubt, the production team shows the lighter-toned surveillance footage to some of the interviewees and asks them to describe what they see. Both Staples and Johnson say they see an unmasked Black man, both Carr and Stanley say they see a white man, Rodriguez says that she also sees a white man, and Moore says that he sees a Black man.\n\n… I still have so many questions.\n\nTotally. Smollett claims he never changed his story and, from what I can tell, this is true. However, there are many discrepancies that someone has to answer for. If the Osundairo brothers weren’t involved, what were they doing at the scene? If the argument is that they weren’t at the scene, how would the local police know to get a warrant to search their homes to get the so-called leverage of the firearms to then coerce them into giving a false statement? While the focus on the specific video footage in the documentary is interesting, what does it matter if Olabinjo’s documents are neither sealed nor expunged, and if the doc’s own interviewees can’t come to a consensus about the racial identity of the two men in the surveillance footage? Many questions falling on Smollett’s side still stand, too: Why would you hire two Black men to allege you were attacked by white men? All in all, The Truth About Jussie Smollett? seemingly leaves us with the same questions we’ve had for, at this point, more than half a decade—years’ worth of legal back-and-forth that already ended up in a guilty conviction.

At the time of his departure from CNN, which was precipitated by CNN canceling his two shows and asking him to take a massive pay cut, the 77-year-old broadcaster suggested he would move to podcasting and independent journalism.\n\nInstead, as he told the Times, Wallace eventually decided that he was pretty much done with being in front of the camera and interviewing newsmakers. “I had spent literally half a century booking guests, researching guests and questioning guests, and it just didn’t hold any particular excitement for me,” Wallace said.\n\n“At this point, that isn’t something that’s in the cards,” he added when asked if he’d consider going back in front of the camera. “But having said that — and to mix a metaphor — who knows when an old fire horse wants to answer the bell?”\n\nPrior to his three-year run with CNN, Wallace had spent 18 years as the anchor of Fox News Sunday, where he also moderated two presidential debates. However, after decamping the conservative cable giant for CNN in late 2021, Wallace said Fox News’ hard-right opinion programming made it “unsustainable” for him to remain there. Prior to his time with Fox, Wallace served as the chief White House correspondent for NBC News.\n\nMeanwhile, with speculation swirling around the direction of CBS News under new Paramount chief David Ellison, especially following the politically strained merger process that saw Paramount pay Donald Trump $16 million to settle a “meritless” lawsuit over a 60 Minutes interview, Wallace maintained that Ellison was a straight shooter.\n\n“I am absolutely convinced that any talk about the new owners wanting to move CBS News in a particular political direction is absolutely mistaken,” Wallace said, adding that Ellison “wants a news organization that lives up to the tradition of Cronkite and Murrow and my dad.”\n\nNotably, after the Paramount merger was officially completed earlier this month, Ellison’s first symbolic stop was to the CBS News offices in New York, where staffers told The Independent that he said “all the right things.”\n\nAt the same time, Wallace declined to talk about the Trump settlement or Paramount handling of 60 Minutes amid the furor over the Kamala Harris interview that sparked Trump’s lawsuit. Amid the previous Paramount leadership’s settlement negotiations with the president, the executive producer of 60 Minutes and the CBS News chief both resigned in protest, claiming their employment became untenable due to corporate interference.\n\nThough he wouldn’t speak about the circumstances surrounding the settlement, Wallace did offer a perspective to the Times when it came to oversight of the network’s flagship news magazine.\n\n“My stepfather, Bill Leonard, helped invent ‘60 Minutes,’ and of course my father was one of the first two anchors. In the early years, and in fact for years thereafter, it was routine that executives of CBS News would screen pieces and comment on them and expect their comments to be acted on,” he said. “I’ve been a little surprised at this notion that somehow ‘60 Minutes’ is an independent entity that isn’t part of CBS News.”\n\nFurthermore, Wallace stated that he has spoken directly to Ellison several times and told the company’s CEO that he wanted “to help him in any way I can.” Still, even as Wallace insists Ellison only has the news division’s best interests at heart, concerns continue to swirl within the network as Ellison has been in talks to purchase Bari Weiss’ “anti-woke” outlet The Free Press, and his father Larry is a well-known Trump ally and megadonor.\n\nIn fact, on Friday morning, Trump heaped praise on Ellison and seemingly indicated that he expected CBS News to give him favorable coverage moving forward.\n\n“I think the news is getting better. They‘re learning that they have no credibility,” Trump gushed. “CBS was just sold to a great person that I know very well. A great man. He actually just bought CBS. And I think he‘s going to do the right thing with it.”\n\nEarlier this week, House Democrats sent Ellison a letter demanding documents and correspondence surrounding the Trump administration’s approval of the merger, stating that they were launching an investigation into whether anti-bribery laws were violated.\n\nIn particular, the ranking members of the House Judiciary and Energy and Commerce committees are seeking answers to Trump’s boast that he reached a “side deal” with Ellison to air $20 million of pro-Trump advertisements on CBS as part of the lawsuit settlement, a claim that Ellison has yet to specifically address.\n\nThe lawmakers are also inquiring about Paramount’s decision to cancel the late-night show of outspoken Trump critic Stephen Colbert days before the merger was approved, as well as Skydance assuring the Federal Communications Commission that it will review “complaints of bias” at CBS News and eliminate all diversity, equity and inclusion policies after it took over Paramount.\n\n“Two wrongs do not make a right—illegitimate demands from the FCC or the Administration do not absolve your company from wrongdoing,” the Democrats' letter to Ellison stated.","summary":"‘I am absolutely convinced that any talk about the new owners wanting to move CBS News in a particular political direction is absolutely mistaken,’ Chris Wallace told The New York Times on Friday.","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/chris-wallace-cbs-paramount-david-ellison-b2812687.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/11/15/21/GettyImages-615754664.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/F95riPnZ-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-22 21:48:27","author":"Justin Baragona","authors":["Justin Baragona"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.144},{"id":353413248,"title":"Head of Pentagon’s intelligence agency fired, officials say","text":"The head of the Pentagon’s intelligence agency has been fired, two U.S. officials told Reuters today, a move the top Democratic lawmaker on the Senate intelligence committee slammed as the latest example of politicizing intelligence by President Donald Trump’s administration.\n\nIt was not immediately clear why Lieutenant General Jeffrey Kruse, who led the Defense Intelligence Agency, was fired. But he is the latest senior military official to have been removed under U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.\n\nThe official, who confirmed Kruse’s removal on condition of anonymity, did not give a reason.\n\n“The firing of yet another senior national security official underscores the Trump administration’s dangerous habit of treating intelligence as a loyalty test rather than a safeguard for our country,” said U.S. Senator Mark Warner, who is the vice chair of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.\n\nThe firing was first reported by the Washington Post.\n\nLATEST FIRING\n\nThe move is the latest attempt by the Trump administration to penalize current and former military, intelligence and law enforcement officials whose views have been seen as at odds with Trump.\n\nIn April, Trump fired General Timothy Haugh as director of the National Security Agency, in a purge that included more than a dozen staff at the White House national security council.\n\nHegseth has also gone after uniformed military officials at the Pentagon. In February, he fired Air Force General C.Q. Brown, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who was dismissed along with five other admirals and generals in an unprecedented shake-up of U.S. military leadership.\n\nThe chief of the U.S. Air Force made a surprise announcement on Monday that he planned to retire only half way through his tenure.\n\nWhile it was not clear exactly why Kruse was fired, it comes after a preliminary DIA assessment leaked to the news media that said the June 22 U.S. airstrikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities had set Tehran’s program back only a few months, a finding contradicting Trump’s claim that the targets were “obliterated.”\n\nThe leaking of the assessment, which Reuters also reported, enraged Trump. The White House denounced the top-secret assessment as “flat out wrong,” and Trump attacked CNN, the New York Times and other outlets that obtained the report, calling them “scum” and “FAKE NEWS.”\n\nThe Trump administration has conducted a sweeping purge of U.S. military and intelligence officers and diplomats that it says is part of an effort to slash the size of the U.S. government, shrinking the federal budget and punishing what it describes as the “politicization or weaponization” of intelligence.\n\nNews of Kruse’s firing came two days after Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard announced that she was revoking on Trump’s orders the security clearances of 37 current and former U.S. intelligence professionals.\n\nThis week’s security clearance revocations were only the latest of scores of such revocations of Trump’s second term. They have included Biden, who defeated Trump in the 2020 election, and former Vice President Kamala Harris, who lost last year’s vote.\n\nEarlier this week Gabbard also announced the first major overhaul of her office since its creation, slashing personnel by more than 40% by October 1 and saving more than $700 million per year.","summary":"The head of the Pentagon&#8217;s intelligence agency has been fired, two U.S. officials told Reuters today, a move the top Democratic lawmaker on the Senate intelligence committee slammed as the latest example of politicizing intelligence by President Donald Trump&#8217;s administration.","url":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2025/08/22/breaking-news/head-of-pentagons-intelligence-agency-fired-officials-say/","image":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/web1_2025-08-22T192333Z_612487536_RC2WKDA9BHTQ_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-MILITARY-INTELLIGENCE.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-22 21:10:00","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.377},{"id":353395982,"title":"Denim, Dating and Conservatism: Inside a 'Make America Hot Again' Party","text":"Beneath a pink \"Make America Hot Again\" projection of an animated Sydney Sweeney in American Eagle jeans, New York City conservatives, many dressed in denim to match, mingled Thursday night at a dating party in Lower Manhattan.On the rooftop of Hotel Chantelle on the trendy Lower East Side, the predominantly male crowd, ranging from their mid-twenties to early-forties, joined other \"like-minded\" suitors at a \"Good Genes\" party—a play on Sweeney's ad campaign that set off the latest skirmish in the culture wars.\"Sometimes I just like being a troll,\" Make America Hot Again host Raquel Debono told Newsweek hours ahead of the event. \"Literally the reason I'm hosting this 'good genes' party is because I just genuinely find it fun to troll. I just actually wanted to piss people off,\" she added.At 29, Debono has carved out her own niche within the MAGA movement as an outspoken conservative living in a deep-blue city. Debono wields a growing social media following, fresh off her split in May from Date Right Stuff—the conservative dating app launched in 2022 by former Trump aide John McEntee. She told Newsweek that her politics have often felt \"all over the place,\" never fully at home with the new right, but also definitely not among liberals, either.She draws fire from both ends of the spectrum, sparring with \"tradwives\" and other hardline conservative women who call out her for being single, not particularly religious and, in their critique, too weak on transgender issues. Debono said she felt out of place when she went to a conference hosted by Turning Point USA, the nonprofit run by MAGA firebrand Charlie Kirk that has become something of a gathering place for young right-wingers.\"I was actually terrified,\" she recalled. \"I genuinely don't belong here.\"Debono said she's also been targeted by the left. \" Like everyone thinks like, oh, she's being racist, bigot, homophobic. I don't know what you people are talking about. I just wanna say what I want, when I want, I wanna pay less taxes. I wanna spend more money on the things that I want to spend more money on. It's just not that serious,\" she told Newsweek.\"I see crazy people on all sides and I think they all need to chill.\"An admirer of President Trump, whom she calls her \"favorite stand-up comedian,\" Debono believes that politics shouldn't be treated so seriously by either side.\"Everything is just like a bit to me,\" she said with a laugh.Dating as a NYC ConservativeAs the era of so-called \"closeted conservatism\" recedes in Trump's second term, New York City's right-leaning singles are taking advantage of a dating pool that belies the city's reputation as being hostile for young Republicans. With tickets going for $44 apiece, more than 70 people turned out for Thursday's party—some in \"Dark MAGA\" caps, others in denim fits or decked out in post-work business casual, and one donning a red, white, and blue Hawaiian shirt emblazoned with Trump's face.Several attendees told Newsweek that parties like this feel easier, offering a space where they're no longer \"walking on eggshells\" or pressured to \"self-censor.\" Even still, most of the partygoers asked to remain anonymous or off the record, with some citing a general distrust of the media.While politics flickered in the background—both in conversation, from jokes about the Sweeney campaign, and physically, courtesy of the harsh light coming from the Fox News cameras trawling the space for a segment — many revelers told Newsweek the real draw wasn't policy talk at all, but the relief of knowing everyone was starting from similar, shared values.Jack Wells, 30, told Newsweek from the rooftop overlooking Manhattan that dating has shifted noticeably under the new administration, with politics surfacing earlier in conversation and carrying more weight than before.Those with right-leaning political beliefs are \"more upfront than they used to be,\" he said, even as dating apps have created a new de facto filter for those who see a potential mate's opposing views as a \"dealbreaker.\" He recalled receiving an automated prompt from some matches that read, simply: \"Unmatch if you're conservative.\"Many in the group voiced fatigue with the dating app scene — a sentiment not at all exclusive to conservatives. Some cited bad matches and dull first dates, and said they're turning back to the age-old strategy of actually meeting people in person. If they can chat and flirt over shared politics, all the better.One woman Newsweek spoke to said she identifies as \"moderate\" on the dating apps, echoing a similar refrain throughout the night that \"city conservatives\" tend to be far less socially conservative than, say, Texas Republicans or the MAGA firebreathers who populate social media discourse. She noted that calling herself \"moderate\" can complicate the prospect of dating liberal men, explaining that while she's open to them, they often fail to reciprocate.Another partygoer, a 29-year-old Manhattan man who asked not to be named, said a past relationship with a liberal woman had soured him on pursuing relationships with women on the left. He recalled feeling unable to \"really fully be myself,\" often worrying that \"I would be judged.\"Debono echoed this sentiment earlier, telling Newsweek that after dating a liberal, she's now more convinced she needs a conservative partner.\"I can't,\" she said. \"Like, I've received a lecture—you make the wrong joke and suddenly it's Islamophobic, homophobic, and racist all in the same sentence. And it's just like, I can't do this.\"Liberals have become \"the party of the hall monitors,\" she said. \"They're always policing your speech.\"Two other attendees, Polish podcasters Tom Winiarski and Mikołaj Teperek, said they don't necessarily rule out dating liberals, but bemoaned the prospect of \"self-censorship.\" Self-avowed communists, though, are a \"red flag.\"The Warsaw-based duo partially timed their U.S. trip around the \"Good Genes\" party, making up for missing the infamous Make America Hot Again inauguration bash in Washington D.C. that was featured in a much-discussed New York magazine cover story. Teperek framed a copy of the issue, which dubbed the soiree, \"The Cruel Kids' Table.\"Despite the MAGA overlay, not everyone at the party was a Trump supporter. Two attendees told Newsweek they had backed then-Vice President Kamala Harris, including Mo, a 27-year-old Iraqi immigrant living in New Jersey.Mo said he couldn't originally get behind Trump's tariff agenda and foreign policy, which he described as \"drunken kung fu\"—mimicking someone swinging wildly—though, he admitted, it has \"somehow landed okay.\"Asked why he came to a dating event marketed toward conservatives, he said it was a no-brainer. He is looking for a partner with an open mind, and hasn't found that among the liberal women he has dated.Another male attendee, a 33-year-old tech founder from D.C., identified himself as a liberal, a term he believes has been \"corrupted.\" His reason for attending the party also had little to do with politics. Conservative women are just better looking, he said.While many arrived hoping for romantic sparks, the night yielded more mingling than matches — though Debono said she was aware of a bunch of dates that have come out of her parties.Unlike the inauguration bash, there was no merchandise, monogrammed \"Make America Hot Again\" swag, or Trump paraphernalia scattered around the bar. To the extent the party was branded at all, it came by way of the online invitation, where the description played off the American Eagle campaign: \"They say good jeans never go out of style...But some things run even deeper. Like tradition. Discipline. And the innate ability to spot a liberal from fifty feet away. Conservatives have good genes. And we're throwing a party to prove it.\"Debono said Thursday's gathering marked her eighth Make America Hot Again party, with earlier editions co-hosted with Date Right Stuff and The Murray Hill Guy, a popular anonymous X account. The Canadian-born organizer said the mixers will go on, but she's already thinking about her next venture.\"My next thing is actually going to be Make America Funny Again,\" she said with a smile.","summary":"Dozens of New York City conservatives gathered for a \"Good Genes\" party, nodding to Sydney Sweeney's controversial American Eagle campaign.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/denim-dating-conservatism-inside-make-america-hot-again-party-2117945","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2708322/make-america-hot-again.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=4f5b4b22fdc4bd2d73e90c2e40078c3b","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-22 20:50:30","author":"Mandy Taheri","authors":["Mandy Taheri"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.009},{"id":353395976,"title":"Gavin Newsom's 2028 Chances Jump After Trolling Offensive Against Trump","text":"The odds-on Gavin Newsom winning the 2028 presidential election have improved from 7/1 (12.5 percent) to 11/2 (15.4 percent) over the past week according to Star Sports, a leading bookmaker, as the California governor continues to troll President Donald Trump on social media.Newsweek contacted Governor Newsom for comment via email on Friday outside of regular office hours.Why It MattersNewsom has been widely tipped as a potential 2028 Democratic presidential candidate, with a recent Politico and Citrin Center poll finding he is the favored candidate of California Democrats, leading former Vice-President Kamala Harris by 25 percentage points to 19 percent.What To KnowOn Thursday Star Sports offered odds of Newsom winning the 2028 presidential election was 11/2 (15.4 percent), a noted improvement on the 7/1 (12.5 percent) recorded one week previously.Overall the California governor is now the second favorite to win in 2028 according to Star Sports, behind only Vice-President J.D. Vance on 11/4 (26.7 percent) and ahead of House Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in third with 12/1 (7.7 percent).President Trump is the fourth favorite to win in 2028 on 16/1 (5.9 percent), a possibility he has toyed with, though it would mean abolishing the two-term limit set out in the 22nd Amendment.He is followed in the Star Sports odds by former transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg on 18/1 (5.3 percent) and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro with 22/1 (4.3 percent).Newsom is also the favorite to be the 2028 Democratic presidential nominee, according to Star Sports, with odds of 5/2 (28.6 percent). This puts him ahead of Ocasio-Cortez on 5/1 (16.7 percent), Buttigieg with 15/2 (11.8 percent) and Shapiro on 11/1 (8.3 percent).Overall, Star Sports is offering odds of 10/11 (52.4 percent) on a Democrat winning the 2028 presidential election, compared to 21/20 (48.8 percent) for a Republican and 16/1 for any other party (5.9 percent).In recent weeks, Governor Newsom has attracted national media attention for backing a redistricting bill that would likely see the Republicans lose five seats in the House of Representatives. The move is a response to a Trump-backed Texas bill that could give the GOP five extra House seats from the Lone Star State. The California bill is designed to take effect only if the Texas one is ratified.The official Newsom press office X account has also taken to mimicking and mocking Donald Trump's style, posting in block capitals and using nicknames for opponents such as 'Just Dance Vance' for Vice-President J.D. Vance. Trump had repeatedly called Newsom \"Newscum\" on his Truth Social website.What People Are SayingSpeaking to Newsweek, Star Sports political betting analyst William Kedjanyi said: \"Gavin Newsom has always been a well-recognized figure in American politics but recently he's asserted himself as a leader of the resistance against President Donald Trump, especially with regards to more combative communications and taking Trump head on and getting under his skin. He's now 5/2 from 7/2 to be declared the Democratic Presidential Nominee in 2028...\"Interestingly the latest Politico poll from California had Newsom leading Harris with Democratic and left-leaning voters in the state. With his increased profile and increased recognition, we've cut Newsom from 7/1 into 11/2. The Democrats are also 10/11 to be the winning party, with the Republicans within reaching distance at 21/20.\"What Happens NextThe next Democratic Presidential primary contest is expected to begin in early 2028, followed by the presidential election against the Republican nominee in November.","summary":"Gavin Newsom's press office has been mocking President Trump with tweets in his style over the past few weeks.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/gavin-newsoms-2028-chances-jump-after-trolling-offensive-against-trump-2118007","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2708284/gavin-newsom.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=a1ed0d4e2ac0efa5f27b136aaa5b734e","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-22 20:40:44","author":"James Bickerton","authors":["James Bickerton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.028},{"id":353386968,"title":"Five Wins That Trump’s New Deputy FBI Director Scored as Missouri Attorney General","text":"President Donald Trump announced this week that Missouri’s Republican attorney general, Andrew Bailey, will join Dan Bongino as co-deputy director of the FBI.\n\n“He has served as a distinguished attorney general for Missouri and is a decorated war veteran, bringing expertise and dedication to service,” U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said. “His leadership and commitment to country will be a tremendous asset as we work together to advance President Trump’s mission. While we know this is undoubtedly a great loss for Missouri, it is a tremendous gain for America.”\n\nBailey said of his appointment: “My life has been defined by a call to service, and I am once again answering that call, this time, at the national level.” \n\nHere are five things to know about Bailey’s time as attorney general:\n\nProtecting Kids From Gender Ideology\n\nBailey won a lawsuit in April to compel Planned Parenthood to produce documents related to the “gender transition” of minors in Missouri.\n\n“This case is not just about documents—it’s about exposing institutions that mislead families, conceal critical information, and prey on vulnerable children under the guise of ‘care,'” Bailey said in a statement at the time. “My office is committed to uncovering the truth, holding bad actors accountable, and cutting through the noise and deception used to normalize irreversible procedures on minors.”\n\nBailey started investigating the use of “transgender” hormones, puberty blockers, and surgeries for minors in the state in March 2023 after a former caseworker at the Washington University Transgender Center said the center rushed children into treatment.\n\nBailey’s office sent civil investigative demands to Children’s Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, Washington University in St. Louis, and the state’s two branches of Planned Parenthood.\n\nProtecting the Unborn\n\nIn January 2023, abortion activists filed suit seeking to dismantle Missouri’s pro-life law, which protects life starting at conception.\n\nBailey responded by filing a motion to dismiss the legal challenge. \n\nIn June 2023, the St. Louis Circuit Court dismissed 10 of the 11 challenges brought by the activists. The following October, the court dismissed the 11th count and granted Bailey’s motion to dismiss. \n\n“Today marks a significant triumph for women and their unborn children as a Missouri court has once again sided with our office in our endeavors to uphold the sanctity of life,” Bailey said at the time.\n\nThis July, Bailey filed a lawsuit against Planned Parenthood for allegedly deceiving women about the safety and efficacy of the abortion pill. The petition seeks more than $1.8 million in civil penalties for daily violations of Missouri law and up to $1,000 in damages or restitution for every Missouri woman Planned Parenthood provided abortion pills to in the past five years.\n\nSecuring the Border\n\nIn November 2024, Bailey and 16 other state attorneys general obtained a court order throwing out the Biden-Harris administration’s “parole in place” rule that allowed millions of illegal immigrants to obtain permanent residency in the U.S.\n\n“Joe Biden and Kamala Harris created a crisis at the southern border, leaving the American people to pay the consequences. In the wake of the federal government’s refusal to act, states like Missouri had no choice but to step in and take action to secure our southern border,” Bailey said at the time. \n\nThe “parole in place” program would have allowed aliens who had been unlawfully present in the United States for 10 or more years to receive a grant of “parole.” Aliens married to a citizen or the stepchild of a citizen would not have been required to leave the country.\n\nBailey also filed a lawsuit in July 2024 against the Biden administration for reportedly flying illegal aliens to the Show Me State to try to settle them there.\n\nHolding China Accountable\n\nThis March, Bailey won a $24 billion judgment in federal court against the Chinese Communist Party for “unleashing the COVID-19 pandemic.”\n\n“This is a landmark victory for Missouri and the United States in the fight to hold China accountable for unleashing COVID-19 on the world,” Bailey said. “China refused to show up to court, but that doesn’t mean they get away with causing untold suffering and economic devastation.

Meanwhile, senior staff were owed six months of base pay. \n\nHowever, according to the lawsuit, most workers did not see a single penny. \n\nWhile a federal judge dismissed the lawsuit in July 2024, McMillian and Cooper appealed, and the case was set to go to trial before the agreement was made.Elon's Other Lawsuit ExplainedIt is not yet known how much money each worker will receive.\n\nMusk bought Twitter for $44billion in 2022, proceeded to change the popular platform's name to X, and then cut around 6,000 jobs.\n\nThe 54-year-old's problems do not end there, however. He was recently ordered by a judge to face a lawsuit claiming he ran an illegal $1million election lottery during Donald Trump's 2024 election run.\n\nHe is being accused of defrauding voters into signing a petition to support the U.S. Constitution, offering a chance to win cash.An 'Illegal' Lottery?Arizona resident Jacqueline McAferty claimed that Musk and America PAC induced voters in several battleground states to sign the petition, promising to choose one person per day to win $ 1million. However, the lawsuit, filed on November 5, 2024, Election Day, notes the voters never had a chance to collect the winnings.\n\nAccording to McAferty, voters were required to provide personal information, including their addresses and phone numbers. Musk did his best to have the suit dismissed, listing \"red flags\" as proof he had not run the alleged illegal lottery.\n\nDespite his pushback, U.S. District Judge Robert Pitman, who was appointed by President Obama in 2014, pointed to other statements suggesting the defendants were \"awarding\" the money, and that the $1million could be \"won.\"\n\n\"It is plausible that plaintiff justifiably relied on those statements to believe that defendants were objectively offering her the chance to enter a random lottery, even if that is not what they subjectively intended to do,\" the judge said in response.Musk pulled out every single trick to help Trump, 79, beat Kamala Harris in November, introducing his \"lottery\" to the masses. But not everyone was a fan of the idea, especially Philadelphia district attorney Lawrence Krasner, who tried to block the gimmicky contest.\n\n\"l'll be seeking a lot more money than that for what Elon Musk and America PAC have done,\" Krasner said. However, Pennsylvania judge Angelo Foglietta ruled Musk's sweepstakes was not illegal at the time.","summary":"Elon Musk has agreed to pay $500million former Twitter employees in severance after he was accused of booting them and not forking over any cash.","url":"https://radaronline.com/p/elon-musk-must-pay-twitter-severance-lawsuit-illegal-election/","image":"https://media.radaronline.com/brand-img/iBV81jWJi/0x0/elon-musk-twitter-severance2-1755884696295.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-22 18:40:00","author":"Bryan Brunati","authors":["Bryan Brunati"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.431},{"id":353363636,"title":"Colin Allred Edges Out Leading Republican in Texas Race—Internal Poll","text":"An internal poll from former Representative Colin Allred's campaign showed him with a lead over state Attorney General Ken Paxton in Texas' U.S. Senate race.Newsweek reached out to the Allred and Paxton campaigns for comment via email.Why It MattersDemocrats will need to compete in states like Texas if they want to win control of the Senate. Republicans currently hold a 53-47 majority. Democrats view Maine, which backed former Vice President Kamala Harris by seven points against President Donald Trump last November, and North Carolina, which voted for Trump by three points, as their best opportunities to flip GOP-held seats. But no other Harris-won or single-digit Trump seats are up for grabs, meaning they will need to win seats in more conservative states like Alaska, Iowa, Ohio or Texas to win a majority.What To KnowAlthough internal polls are typically not viewed as reliably as independent surveys, the new poll underscores the potentially competitive nature of the race.Texas voted for Trump by double digits last year, but Democrats are hopeful the race could become competitive next year—particularly if Paxton defeats Senator John Cornyn in the Republican primary. Polls suggest that Paxton has built a lead among the state's conservative electorate but would not have Cornyn's advantage as a well-known, established incumbent in the general election.Allred led Paxton by 2 percentage points in the poll conducted by GBAO. Forty-nine percent of respondents said they would vote for Allred, while 47 percent said they intended to cast their ballots for Paxton. Four percent said they are undecided.The poll surveyed 800 likely voters from August 13-18 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.The release of the poll comes just days after an independent poll found that Allred could be vulnerable to a primary challenger, and the Allred campaign in the memo touted the poll as showing he is \"the one who can win it.\"\"If Democrats are to retake the majority, they must compete in Texas — and Colin is already proving that he's the one who can win it,\" the campaign's polling memo said. \"Research from GBAO shows Colin 2 points ahead of likely GOP nominee Ken Paxton, confirming earlier research from the GOP's Senate Leadership Fund and Donald Trump's own pollster.\"A Texas Southern University's Barbara Jordan Public Policy Research and Survey Center poll released Tuesday showed that former Representative Beto O'Rourke would have a lead over Allred if he decides to run for Senate (58 percent to 38 percent), while Representative Joaquin Castro and state Representative James Talarico could also be competitive against Allred in the primary.Republicans plan to spend millions of dollars to support Cornyn in the primary to avoid a more expensive general election, Punchbowl News reported this month.An Emerson College poll, which surveyed 1,000 registered voters from August 11-12, showed Paxton leading Allred by 5 points (46 percent to 41 percent), while Cornyn led Allred by 7 points (45 percent to 38 percent). It had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 points.Meanwhile, a survey conducted by GOP pollster Brad Parscale showed Paxton trailing Allred in a hypothetical matchup. It found that 52 percent of voters would likely vote for Allred to 37 percent for Paxton. It surveyed 1,000 likely voters in mid-April.Still, winning Texas would be a major uphill challenge for Allred or another Democrat. Texas has not voted Democratic on the presidential level since 1976 and has not voted for a Democratic senator since 1988. The state last elected a Democratic governor in 1990.Trump won Texas by more than 13 points last November, performing stronger in suburban areas while also making inroads in southern Texas, a heavily Hispanic area that shifted rightward.Allred, however, lost by a smaller 8.5-point margin against GOP Senator Ted Cruz.Paxton has challenged Cornyn in the primary from the right, and polls suggest he has an early lead. The Texas Southern University poll showed Paxton leading by 5 points (44 percent to 39 percent).What People Are SayingAllred campaign manager Dan Morrocco, in a statement provided to Newsweek: \"Colin enters this race stronger than ever — already leading Ken Paxton, backed by one of the highest favorability ratings of any candidate, and building the broad, diverse coalition it will take to win. That's why Texas is now firmly on the Senate battleground map, and why Colin is the Democrat who can finally deliver a statewide victory.\"Senator John Cornyn, on X: \"Another day, another poll showing [Ken Paxton] losing the Texas Senate seat. A corrupt Republican nominee would help elect first statewide Democrat in 30 years.\"Mark Jones, a Rice University political scientist who co-authored the report from the Barbara Jordan Public Policy Research and Survey center, previously told Newsweek: \"The irony for Allred is that the qualities that make him more attractive to national Democrats—that is being more pragmatic, more centrist and better able to win over independents and moderate Republicans—tend to make him less attractive among Democratic primary voters who see him as too close to the center, too focused on appealing to moderate Republicans, rather than to progressive Democrats.\"What Happens NextThe Cook Political Report classifies the race as Likely Republican, meaning it is \"not considered competitive at this point\" but has \"the potential to become engaged.\" Sabato's Crystal Ball also lists the race as Likely Republican.The primary will be held on March 3, 2026.","summary":"Allred held a lead over Attorney General Ken Paxton in an internal poll released Friday in Texas' U.S. Senate race.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/colin-allred-leads-ken-paxton-texas-poll-2117912","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2708067/colin-allred-leads-ken-paxton-texas-poll.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=16c9e9710eadf2f323c7f346d2dbce41","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-22 17:39:35","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.294},{"id":353347892,"title":"Ben Shapiro compares Kamala Harris’ \"107 Days\" book tour to the post-apocalyptic horror film \"28 Days Later\"","text":"Conservative commentator Ben Shapiro recently compared former Vice President Kamala Harris' upcoming book with the 2002 post-apocalyptic horror film 28 Days Later. The comment, made on X on August 22, 2025, was in response to the news of Harris' 15-city international tour to promote her memoir, 107 Days.The book, which is due to be released on September 23, details Kamala Harris' short-lived presidential campaign in 2024, which she frames as \"a journal\" of her 107-day candidacy, which followed President Joe Biden's unexpected decision to withdraw from the race.The tour, which was announced on Thursday, August 21, begins on September 24 and ends in late November, with events planned in major cities like New York and San Francisco, as well as international stops in Toronto and London. In response to the book tour, Ben Shapiro tweeted, saying:\"I'm just gonna assume this is the sequel to \"28 Days Later\".\"The film 28 Days Later focuses on a ruined, rage-infected zombie Britain starting 28 days after the outbreak. In Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later, Jim, a bike messenger, wakes from a coma to a desolate London ravaged by a virus that turned humans into violent infected.According to The Guardian, an intensely scary horror film, 28 Days Later provides haunting images of the post-apocalyptic present.Ben Shapiro’s previous comments on Kamala Harris' upcoming memoirBen Shapiro recently commented on Kamala Harris’ appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, where he talked about the interview and Harris’ newly announced memoir, 107 Days.In the video shared on his YouTube channel on August 2, Shapiro noted a number of talking points from their conversation and asked whether Harris is still popular, whether she is ineffective, and where Harris is politically after her failed run for president.\"For all the talk in the media about how she was 'brat' and joy and a wonderful candidate—Joy Reid said she ran a flawless, flawless campaign—and for all of that, ain't nobody talking about her running again in 2028. Weird,\" he added.Ben Shapiro claimed Harris' choice to publish a book detailing what she referred to as the \"shortest presidential campaign in modern political history\" came off as self-serving. He also mocked the TikTok trend that accompanied the book as being lame and stated that it was an effort by Harris to appeal to the younger audiences.\"But if she can't make it a bestseller by telling you about it, perhaps she can make it a bestseller by doing a TikTok trend about it, because there is nothing that more says you're in touch with the kids than being a 60-year-old person who's doing TikTok trends... Oh my god,\" he remarked.Ben Shapiro also criticized Kamala Harris for talking about personal stories in her book, like the time her husband forgot to celebrate her birthday, saying many of these stories were quite irrelevant for a political memoir and would not help her public perception.With tickets now on sale, including VIP packages with photo ops with Kamala Harris, the upcoming book tour events are set to stir up a lot of buzz from the Democrats as well as the Republicans.","summary":"Conservative commentator Ben Shapiro recently compared former Vice President Kamala Harris' upcoming book with the 2002 post-apocalyptic horror film 28 Days Later.","url":"https://www.sportskeeda.com/us/podcasts/news-ben-shapiro-compares-kamala-harris-107-days-book-tour-post-apocalyptic-horror-film-28-days-later","image":"https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2025/08/17048-17558703708897-1920.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-22 17:11:55","author":"Diana George","authors":["Diana George"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.189},{"id":353423922,"title":"GOP Rep.

Brandon Gill (R-TX) suggested the possibility of the House Oversight Committee subpoenaing former Vice President Kamala Harris, as part of the committee’s investigation into former President Joe Biden’s cognitive decline while in office.\n\nAccording to the Texas Republican, Harris could offer insight into Biden’s tenure.\n\n“The House Oversight Committee just interviewed former Biden White House spokesman Ian Sams yesterday,” host Cheryl Casone said. “I want to get your take on this. This is the latest testimony in the autopen investigation. Oversight Chair James Comer gave some insight into the interview. He revealed that the ex-Biden spokesman only saw the 46th president twice in two plus years of service, and then Chairman Comer also hinted at a subpoena for former Vice President Kamala Harris as they — excuse me, former President Biden’s mental decline. They say her testimony would be incredibly helpful to unravel the autopen portion of the investigation. And you even got these new documents showing even more people inside the Biden White House had raised concerns about what was going on. The oversight project obtain these documents from the DOJ. This former Assistant Deputy Attorney General, Bradley Weinsheimer, he raised concerns about Biden’s slew of term and pardons for Federal convicts. I want to get your reaction to all of this. You — by the way, serve on oversight, so I certainly want to get first and foremost your take on that?”\n\nGill replied, “Yes, of course. Listen, these are the people who portrayed themselves as being in the know, whenever all the American people watched Joe Biden on TV, we could see his cognitive decline. We saw his debate performance. We could see his eyes glazing over whenever reporters were asking him questions. And yet the people who should have been around him, who portrayed themselves as knowing Biden’s actual mental state, actually had no clue what they were talking about, and instead lied to the American people and said what you’re seeing isn’t the case. I know that he is totally fine whenever they had no clue. You know this isn’t just an indictment of the Biden administration and the people around him, but it’s also an indictment of Left-wing legacy media, who didn’t ask anybody if they had any evidence that Biden was actually as mentally acute as some of the people ostensibly around him were portraying it. This is a huge scandal and we’re going to continue these investigations.”\n\n“Are you going to subpoena Kamala Harris?” Casone asked.\n\n“I would like to see Kamala Harris subpoenaed,” Gill said. “I think that she should have been close to Joe Biden more than most people, and I think she’s got a lot to answer for as well.”\n\nFollow Jeff Poor on X @jeff_poor","summary":"During Friday's broadcast of Fox Business Network's \"Mornings with Maria,\" Rep.

After divulging his intentions to some women he knew, he said they reacted with shock.\n\n'All the women looked in and go, \"You mean, you're not voting for Kamala?\" And I go, \"I just can't do that.\" And then one of them leaned in further and said, \"Are you voting for Trump?\" And I said, \"I am.\" I swear!'\n\nGrazer may be unusual in admitting it, but plenty of people in the industry are just like him. Yet they fear being open about their vote, with good reason.\n\nLook at Sydney Sweeney, targeted by the woke left for her American Eagle denim ad.\n\nWhen tarring her as a racist didn't work, they dug up her voter registration — and yes, the 27-year-old actress, one of Hollywood's newly minted superstars, registered as a Republican in June 2024.\n\nIn her new cover profile for the Wall Street Journal magazine, Sweeney refuses to discuss her politics. And this is a woman who otherwise describes herself, in this very article, as 'pretty blunt'.\n\n'I've never understood why people try to beat around the bush and not just be direct,' Sweeney says.\n\nPerhaps her decision to stay apolitical is a financial one. As Michael Jordan famously (shrewdly) said, 'Republicans buy sneakers, too.'\n\nIf the last election proved anything, it's that celebrities — no matter how A-list — have zero influence in the way average Americans vote.\n\nLook no further than Beyoncé, Bruce Springsteen, Julia Roberts, Meryl Streep, Rihanna, Oprah Winfrey and, of course, Taylor Swift, who seemingly thought her immense popularity could sway the election to Kamala Harris.\n\nAlas, it could not. Have most celebrities taken the note?\n\nNo — of course not!\n\nStephen Colbert just got himself canceled and the whole Late Show with it.\n\nHoward Stern has been on the bubble since inviting Harris on his show, confessing his terror should Trump win.\n\n'You've gotta win,' he told her on air last October. 'You just have to... like, the sun's literally gonna go out.'\n\nThe only thing on the way out is Howard's career. Oh — and his reputation as someone who understood his audience and never, ever would have talked down to them this way.\n\nSame with Sarah Jessica Parker, Michael Patrick King and Cynthia Nixon, whose on and off-screen wokeness killed 'And Just Like That'.\n\nDisney's 'Snow White' remake was doomed not just by insisting on a Latina version of the heroine, but statements and posts made by 24-year-old leading lady Rachel Zegler, who called the entire concept of the classic 'outdated', agitated for Palestine and said she hoped that 'Trump voters and Trump himself never know peace'.\n\nProducer Marc Platt was reportedly so alarmed he flew to New York City to hold crisis talks with Zegler. Disney scaled back the film's premiere considerably. But the harm was already done.\n\nPlatt's son Jonah, in a since-deleted post, said what would have been unsayable just two years ago.\n\n'Her [Zegler's] actions clearly hurt the box office', Jonah posted in March. 'Tens of thousands of people worked on that film and she hijacked the conversation for her own immature desires at the risk of all the colleagues and crew and blue-collar workers who depend on that movie to be successful.'\n\nZegler, according to her IMDB profile, has yet to book another acting job.\n\nJust weeks ago, Disney and Lucasfilm company settled a lawsuit brought by actress Gina Carano, who was fired after posting right-leaning tweets.\n\nHer lawsuit was funded by Elon Musk and resolved with a Lucasfilm spokesperson stating that 'Ms. Carano was always well respected by her directors, co-stars, and staff, and she worked hard to perfect her craft while treating her colleagues with kindness and respect'.\n\nIn other words: Carano wasn't a racist, transphobic bigot who deserved to be fired.\n\nThe examples just go on: Lena Dunham, one-time feminist provocateur whose latest Netflix show 'Too Much' is a critical flop and has yet to be renewed; MSNBC gets spun off from NBC Universal and changes its call letters to 'MS NOW'; Dylan Mulvaney's book 'Paper Doll: Notes from a Late Bloomer', released in March, flopped; Bud Light, nearly brought down by its partnership with Mulvaney, debuted a new, male-centric ad campaign at last year's Super Bowl starring Post Malone, Trump supporter Dana White, and Peyton Manning.\n\nAnd what do you know — it worked. Bud's ad was the sixth-most watched on YouTube that night, according to Variety.\n\nQuietly, inexorably, Hollywood moves not just to the center but to Red America. Taylor Sheridan's modern-day Western 'Yellowstone', which premiered in the middle of President Biden's first (and only) term, was a mammoth, mainstream hit.\n\nSheridan followed with 'Landman', set in Texas oilfields and recently renewed for Season 2.\n\nBravo, with programming that normally caters to coastal elites, premiered Season 2 of 'The McBee Dynasty: Real American Cowboys' in June.\n\nMarvel star Chris Pratt this week told Bill Maher — who had a private dinner with President Trump in the White House earlier this year — that he loves the MAHA movement and his wife's cousin, HHS secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\n'There's certain things [that Bobby] oversees that seem to be supported in a bipartisan way — like getting terrible toxic stuff out of our kids' food,' Pratt said. 'I'd hate to be so mired in hatred for the president that any success from his administration is something I'd be having an allergic reaction to.'\n\nNow it's woke Hollywood causing allergic reactions.\n\nConsider that one of Netflix's biggest shows isn't 'With Love, Meghan' or anything the Obamas have produced but 'The Hunting Wives' — a MAGA-adjacent soap set in Texas with guns as the most prominent prop.\n\nShowrunner Rebecca Cutter told Variety that when she was pitching the show, she was asked: 'Is this a show that both liberals and conservatives can watch?'\n\nCutter says she replied, 'Yes, absolutely...

In reality, the vast majority of D.C. residents oppose the move and feel it makes them less safe.\n\nAfter mocking MSNBC’s upcoming name change, claiming it was “because they‘re ashamed of it and they‘re disassociating it from NBC, which is also fake news,” Trump then brought up CBS and Ellison – and had nothing but good things to say.\n\n“I think the news is getting better. They‘re learning that they have no credibility,” he declared. “CBS was just sold to a great person that I know very well.”\n\nTrump continued: “A great man. He actually just bought CBS. And I think he‘s going to do the right thing with it.”\n\nEllison is the son of close Trump ally and megadonor Larry Ellison, the Oracle founder who invested billions of dollars in David Ellison’s Skydance merger with Paramount. Weeks before the Federal Communications Commission – led by Trump’s hand-picked chairman Brendan Carr – finally approved the Skydance-Paramount deal, Trump similarly sang the younger Ellison’s praises.\n\n“Ellison’s great,” the president told reporters in mid-June. “He’ll do a great job with it.”\n\nEarlier this week, the ranking members of the House Judiciary and Energy and Commerce committees sent Ellison a letter demanding documents and correspondence related to the administration’s approval process of the Paramount merger, which officially closed on August 7.\n\nSpecifically, the two Democratic congressmen are seeking answers surrounding not only the settlement of the Trump lawsuit, which has sparked accusations of bribery from lawmakers and free press organizations, but also the president’s claim that he reached a “side deal” with Ellison.\n\nShortly after the previous Paramount leadership announced it was paying Trump $16 million to settle the 60 Minutes complaint, Trump boasted that Ellison had agreed to air up to $20 million of pro-Trump advertisements and programming on CBS once the merger went through. While the old Paramount denied any knowledge of any secret agreement, Ellison has remained mum on the matter.\n\n“This offer was necessarily contingent on the FCC approving the deal and does not appear to present any legitimate value to the public, only to President Trump,” Reps. Frank Pallone and Jamie Raskin wrote Ellison this week. “Therefore, this appears to be an offer of payment and benefits to a government official designed to achieve a specific outcome from the government — in other words, a bribe.”\n\nAdditionally, the Democrats are inquiring about Paramount’s decision to cancel the top-rated late-night show hosted by outspoken Trump critic Stephen Colbert just days before the merger was approved, as well as Skydance’s assurance to the FCC that it would review “complaints of bias” at CBS News and eliminate all diversity hiring practices. Both Trump and Carr publicly celebrated Colbert’s cancellation.\n\nOn top of that, Raskin and Pallone noted that during the negotiations with Trump to settle the lawsuit, which CBS lawyers said was “without merit” and legal experts described as frivolous, the executive producer of 60 Minutes and CBS News chief Wendy McMahon both resigned in protest.\n\n“Two wrongs do not make a right—illegitimate demands from the FCC or the Administration do not absolve your company from wrongdoing,” the letter to Ellison stated. “If Skydance offered a side deal of up to $20 million worth of advertisement or programming to President Trump in order to receive regulatory approval for the merger with Paramount, these actions would run afoul of federal and state anti-bribery statutes.”\n\nThe lawmakers added: “Similarly, if Paramount forced out CBS’s longtime leaders, spent $16 million to settle a sham lawsuit with President Trump, or cancelled a highly popular comedy show that President Trump dislikes in order to curry favor with the Administration and to receive regulatory approval for the merger with Skydance, these actions would likely further embolden President Trump to use lawsuits and regulatory authority to attack media organizations that he finds objectionable in order to silence them.”\n\nIn the meantime, it appears that Ellison and his senior leadership are preparing to enact painful cuts to the news network. Puck’s Dylan Byers reported this week that Paramount sources had told him CBS News was losing around $50 million a year, a claim a CBS News spokesperson pushed back hard against, saying the news division is “currently profitable.”\n\nStill, based on the Byers item, it appears that Ellison and Paramount president Jeff Shell are laying the groundwork to make sweeping layoffs at CBS News – and soon. “The stage has been set for a round of painful cost-cutting,” Status News’ Oliver Darcy noted. “In other words, the disputed number may ultimately be less important than the larger narrative it helps justify: CBS News is about to face some painful budget cuts.”","summary":"‘CBS was just sold to a great person that I know very well,’ Donald Trump declared on Friday.","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-cbs-david-ellison-paramount-settlement-b2812624.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/22/14/05/US-POLITICS-TRUMP-s3gkc5cb.jpeg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/xgaaYRH8-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-22 16:51:45","author":"Justin Baragona","authors":["Justin Baragona"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.036},{"id":353338952,"title":"Joe Concha slams James Carville: ‘He’s been wrong about everything’","text":"While in England on vacation, Vance spoke to U.S. troops stationed at the Royal Air Force Base in Fairford and met with foreign leaders, including British Foreign Minister David Lammy. \n\n“At this point [Carville] is only on because he says things in that Louisiana cajun accent that is usually provocative, and therefore that is what makes him interesting, I suppose,” Concha said on Fox & Friends. “But look at his record, the guy is always wrong.” \n\nCarville, the lead strategist in former President Bill Clinton’s successful 1992 presidential campaign, criticized Democrats for failing to target Vance in their political messaging. \n\n“Use JD Vance,” Carville said in Thursday’s episode of his podcast, “and just kick the s*** out of him every chance you get.”\n\nConcha argued that Carville doesn’t have credibility, noting that he has often been wrong in the past, including predictions that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton would win in a “landslide” in the 2016 election and that former Vice President Kamala Harris would beat President Donald Trump in the 2024 election.\n\nHARRIS ANNOUNCES FALL BOOK TOUR FOR HER UPCOMING MEMOIR\n\nDuring an appearance on Fox & Friends on Friday, Concha said that Bill Clinton won in 1992 because of his “charisma” and former President George H.W.

Washington police arrested an average of 56 people daily last year, according to city data.\n\nThe Justice Department, which did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment, has not specified whether the arrests were made entirely by federal agents or whether they include law enforcement action by Washington’s Metropolitan Police Department.\n\nBut local TV channel ABC 7 News quoted federal officials as saying the numbers included arrests by all agencies in the city.\n\nIt’s also not clear whether the detention of undocumented immigrants is included in the tally. Arrests made by ICE were only distinguished in Bondi’s daily announcements on Thursday and Friday.\n\nBut Trump and his aides are talking up the arrests as a considerable feat.\n\nOn Thursday evening, Trump rode around Washington with law enforcement officers in a show of control and defiance against critics of the crackdown.\n\n“We’ve had some incredible results. … It’s like a different place. It’s like a different city. It’s the capital. It’s going to be the best in the world,” the US president told soldiers and law enforcement officers.\n\nVice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth also visited Union Station on Wednesday, where they ordered burgers at a fast food restaurant as protesters chanted against them.\n\nTrump first suggested federalising law enforcement in Washington after an employee of his cost-cutting Department of Government Efficiency was assaulted during a carjacking early this month.\n\nWhy Washington?\n\nSince he entered politics in 2015, Trump has described major cities, which are almost all run by Democrats, as infested by crime, drugs and homelessness.\n\nThat perception echoed some rural conservative attitudes towards liberal cities.\n\nTrump has long threatened to send the military to cities he views as dangerous, but the US Constitution gives the power of policing to the states, not the federal government.\n\nWashington, DC, however, is not a state. As the US capital, it has no votes in the US Congress or enshrined state rights.\n\nWhile the District of Columbia Home Rule Act of 1973 gives the local government some control over the city, the federal government retains some powers over Washington. For example, Congress may overturn local resolutions approved by the city council.\n\nThe law also allows the president to take over policing in the capital for 30 days.\n\nThe city votes overwhelmingly for the Democratic Party – Democrat Kamala Harris won Washington against Trump, a Republican, with 92.5 percent of the ballots last year – and it has been ripe for a Trump crackdown.\n\nSeveral residents expressed bewilderment to Al Jazeera and questioned the need for patrols by federal forces in crowded metro stations and tourist areas that are low-crime spots.\n\nIced out. 🥶 pic.twitter.com/xhexqgmbzS\n— Homeland Security (@DHSgov) August 14, 2025\n\nCrime in DC\n\nWashington is a city of 700,000 people with a metropolitan area that extends into suburbs in Maryland and Virginia and encompasses more than six million residents.\n\nKindle said some tourists and Republican officials want Washington to look like an “amusement park” rather than the densely populated metropolis that it is.\n\n“They think that this is like Disneyland. This is a tourist spot. It should be sanitised for them,” he said. “But they’re seeing what they would see in their own cities.”\n\nDespite improvements in recent years, several residents told Al Jazeera that crime still remains a concern in Washington.\n\nThe city has a homicide rate of about 25 per 100,000 residents, which is significantly higher than the national average but lower than other cities of similar size, including Detroit, Michigan, and Memphis, Tennessee.\n\nUS News & World Report, which tracks crime data, does not include Washington on the list of the 25 most dangerous cities in the country.\n\nSome welcome the National Guard\n\nWashington continues to suffer from property crime that sometimes turns violent, especially carjackings involving juveniles, with 190 incidents recorded this year so far.\n\nIn defending the deployment of troops in Washington, the White House argued on its website that the capital has the fourth highest homicide rate in the country – “nearly six times higher than New York City and also higher than Atlanta, Chicago, and Compton.”\n\nLeroy Miles, a 75-year-old retiree, said “it’s good” that federal forces are helping the local police.\n\nMiles said he was no fan of Trump and called him a “crook” but accused local authorities of not doing an adequate job in combating crime.\n\n“These young people out here, they’re robbing and killing. They’re carjacking. So they need some type of old law and order,” said Miles, who has always lived in Washington.\n\n“What’s happening – a lot of people don’t like it, but it might work.”\n\n‘Less safe’\n\nParker stressed that there is no crime crisis in Washington, but he added that it “doesn’t mean that we don’t have more work to do”.\n\n“There are ways in which our local government can productively work with the federal government,” Parker said.\n\n“And what is happening here – where there is an influx of federal officers across the city and National Guards, people deployed, including those from other states – is not the way. This is not how this should be done.”\n\nHe underscored that the Republican-controlled Congress has cut and so far failed to restore $1bn in funding for Washington – money that would go to fighting crime, paying police officers and supporting city services that enhance public safety.\n\nThe council member expressed admiration for National Guard troops, who are called on to help in crises and natural disasters, but he said bringing outsiders to police the city could erode trust between the community and law enforcement officers.\n\n“We’re already seeing it. I have heard directly from residents who are second-guessing calling 911 in instances of true emergencies for fear of what’s going to be the outcome or who might show up at their door,” he said.\n\n“I’m hearing from parents that they are concerned about sending their kids to school for the first day of school next week. I am hearing from residents who are defending and rallying against ICE patrols that are seeking to criminalise our neighbours.”\n\nParker said the federal crackdown is making Washington “less safe”.\n\n‘We are on edge’\n\nA Washington Post poll released on Wednesday suggested 80 percent of Washington residents oppose “Trump taking control of DC’s police and federal troops patrolling the streets” while 72 percent of respondents favour the city becoming a state.\n\nLoss of local control in a place where tax-paying citizens do not have federal voting representation is another aspect that is raising protests against the Trump takeover.\n\n“We have, as a country, allowed for the disenfranchisement of Washingtonians, and now there is an effort to undermine the local autonomy that we do have,” Parker said.\n\nWes, a Washington resident who wished to be identified by his first name only, citing fear of reprisal by the government, warned that the tensions around the issue could boil over.\n\n“We are on edge. You got people that’s scared to come out of their houses,” Wes said outside the Columbia Heights metro station, which saw a heavy ICE presence earlier this week.\n\n“You got people scared to walk the streets like they used to because of this show of force. We do not trust the police here at all. Now you bring somebody we don’t know, that has no skills about you. They’re not even from here. They don’t know how this city works.”\n\nHe said that with people growing frustrated with excessive policing and cuts to social programmes, violence and riots could break out, and Trump would be to blame.\n\n“He thrives on chaos. And if there ain’t no chaos, he creates chaos,” Wes said.","summary":"Critics call the federal takeover of Washington, DC, a &#039;manufactured crisis&#039; aimed at political gain.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/22/on-edge-trumps-military-deployment-in-us-capital-sparks-fear-confusion?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-08-20T165128Z_510305234_RC2FAGAIV52R_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-CRIME-DC-1755865778.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-22 15:53:58","author":"Ali Harb,Apps Support","authors":["Ali Harb","Apps Support"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.104},{"id":353344698,"title":"Republicans rally around GOP senator after ousted Dem jumps into high-profile Ohio race","text":"Republicans in the state of Ohio, and across the country, have been rallying around freshman Sen. Jon Husted this week after Democrat Sherrod Brown, who represented Ohio in the Senate for almost 20 years before being unseated last year, announced he is running for Husted’s seat. \"Sherrod Brown’s recent announcement means Ohioans will face a clear choice in 2026,\" Jon Husted for Senate Communications Director Tyson Shepard told Fox News Digital. \"For 30 years, he has imposed Washington’s problems on Ohio, pushing radical liberal policies that have left a lasting burden on the next generation. Jon Husted offers the opposite approach, applying Ohio’s values and solutions to fix a broken Washington. The challenges our nation faces are the same ones Husted has helped our state confront and overcome, championing the values he learned growing up in northwest Ohio: hard work, personal responsibility, family, faith, freedom and patriotism.\" Republicans across the Buckeye State have echoed similar sentiments this week, expressing optimism that Husted, who was appointed to the Senate earlier this year by Ohio’s Republican Gov. Mike DeWine to fill the seat vacated when J.D. Vance left the Senate to become vice president, will defeat Brown next year. GOP SENATOR REVEALS WHY TRUMP'S 'COMPLETE AND TOTAL ENDORSEMENT' WILL BE CRUCIAL FOR HIS MIDTERM RACE Ohio Republican Sen. Bernie Moreno, who defeated Brown last year despite entering the race as an underdog in the polls, said on X this week, \"After 50 years of living off the tax payer, losing an election by a wide margin with $300 million in out of state money, abandoning working Ohioans to be Chuck Schumer’s lap dog, and sucking up to coastal elites, it’s time for @SherrodBrown to just go away.\" \"Ohio is lucky to have @SenJonHusted in the Senate!,\" Ohio Republican Congressman Jim Jordan posted on X after Brown’s announcement. DeWine has commented on the race as well, calling Brown a \"formidable\" candidate but saying that he believes Husted \"will win.\" Ohio Republican Congressman Max Miller told AM 1420 The Answer this week that he has \"no idea what Brown is thinking getting back into this race\" adding, \"Men in women's sports, open borders, selling out to China? Ohioans don't like that.\" Republican leaders outside the state of Ohio are lining up behind Husted as well, including Senator and National Republican Senatorial Committee Chair Tim Scott, who said about Brown on X, \"We beat him once. We’ll beat him again.\" TRUMP URGES TEXAS REPUBLICANS TO SWIFTLY PASS REDISTRICTING MAPS WHILE NEWSOM, CALIFORNIA DEMS COUNTER Support for Husted has also come from some corners of Ohio that historically would have been fond of Brown, who has championed himself as a candidate of the working class over the past 20 years, as evidenced by endorsements he received this week from the sheriff of Brown’s home county and an endorsement from the Northwest Ohio Building & Construction Trades Council (NWOBCTC), which represents 18 affiliated local unions and thousands of skilled workers across eight Ohio counties. \"More momentum for @JonHusted,\" Ohio Republican Secretary of State Frank LaRose, who ran in the Republican primary to unseat Brown last year, posted on X in response to the Northwest Ohio Building & Construction Trades Council endorsement. \"While Sherrod Brown talks a big game his record tells a different story. He has toed the line for coastal elites focusing on their radical leftist agenda and ignoring the needs of Ohios working families. Jon actually fights for Ohio workers and this is a well earned endorsement!\" Brown, who spent over three decades representing Ohio in the House and later the Senate, was highly recruited by top national Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who made two trips to the Buckeye state to try and convince Brown to run again. 4 KEY SENATE SEATS REPUBLICANS AIM TO FLIP IN 2026 MIDTERMS TO EXPAND THEIR MAJORITY Husted, who has served as Ohio's Lieutenant Governor and Secretary of State, has Trump's endorsement as he runs next year to fill the final two years of Vance's six-year term. \"I didn’t plan to run for office again, but when I see what’s going on, I know I can do something about it for Ohio,\" Brown, who served as chair of the Senate Banking Committee during his tenure in D.C., said in a campaign launch video. Schumer and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, chair of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC), argued in a statement that \"no one fights harder for Ohio than Sherrod Brown. From securing Ohioans’ retirement and Social Security benefits to cracking down on fentanyl from China and Mexico, Sherrod will always do what’s right for Ohioans.\" The X account belonging to the DSCC has been actively touting Brown's announcement, labeling Brown as a candidate who is \"looking out for Ohio workers' and accusing Husted of \"selling out Ohioans’\" with his support for Trump's \"Big Beautiful Bill.\" Ohio was once a top general election battleground state, but has turned increasingly red over the past decade. Trump carried the state by 11 points over then-Vice President Kamala Harris. But Brown outperformed the top of the ticket, losing to Moreno by less than four points.

If it were, then the 2024 presidential election in which Trump defeated Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris was not an honest election. Yet, it absolutely was, and Trump won it with the help of mail-in voting.\n\nWorries and concerns about fraudulent mail-in ballots are akin to seeing Bigfoot walk in the wild. It just doesn’t happen. Mail-in ballots are as secure as any other voting mechanism. Thinking otherwise is nothing but sheer paranoia. Why this baseless conspiracy still exists, especially after 2024, in which mail-in voting helped Trump win the presidential election, is mind-numbingly frustrating. \n\nLater, the president then made a post on Truth Social bashing mail-in voting, proclaiming that he was going to lead a movement to remove it.\n\nThe president’s post was rife with inaccuracies, including that the United States is the only country to use mail-in voting. That, of course, is not true. But the caveat in all of this is that it was mail-in voting that helped propel Trump to victory. He had a much better GOTV strategy and ground game in the 2024 presidential election, which prioritized utilizing mail-in voting. This strategy worked. Instead of rejecting it, Trump should use his political genius to embrace it and maximize it in his favor. \n\nMail-in voting became controversial during the 2020 presidential election that happened during the COVID-19 pandemic. Trump and many of his supporters believe that Democrats used mail-in voting to cheat, despite no legitimate or substantive claims showing exactly how it was done. No investigations showed rampant fraud with mail-in voting. And, the U.S. has used mail-in voting for years, long before the 2020 election. At no other time were there accusations of widespread voting fraud. \n\nSure, there should probably be some reforms implemented. It would probably make sense that if a voter was to choose the convenience of mail-in voting, then there should be requirements to have that ballot arrive before Election Day. However, that and other possible reforms, can be sorted out later. The crux of the matter is mail-in balloting helps people vote.\n\nFurthermore, if done correctly, with a cogent strategy and dedicated effort to maximing its return, mail-in voting can be weaponized to be a wonderful tool for Trump and other Republicans. It is a way to make voting more convenient, which could increase the number of people who vote in each election. This is a very good thing, and being the marketing guru and superb businessman that Trump is, there is no doubt in my mind that he can use it to his advantage. \n\nTrump should do what is right and beneficial. He should make mail-in voting great again.","summary":"President Donald Trump made an unexpected pivot earlier this week after his diplomatic outreach and foreign policy meetings to attempt to end the Russia-Ukraine war.

But Democrats Aren't Winning Them.","text":"Support for Donald Trump among Latino voters is falling, but Democrats aren't benefiting from the shift. New polling shows a growing number of Latino voters feel politically disillusioned with both parties and increasingly undecided heading into the 2026 midterms.Pew Research Center's latest survey shows Trump's approval rating among Latino voters has dropped to 27 percent, returning to levels last seen during his first campaign. Republican strategist Mike Madrid, who has studied Latino voting patterns for decades, said Republicans are making a serious miscalculation by assuming the 2024 gains will hold.\"They're treating 2024 like a permanent shift,\" Madrid told Newsweek. \"But Latino support for Trump is already reverting to where it was in 2016.\"Latino voters have traditionally leaned Democratic, but Trump made major inroads in 2024, winning 48 percent of the Hispanic vote—more than any Republican since George W. Bush in 2004. That support now appears wobbly at best.\"Latinos are behaving more like the general electorate,\" said Eduardo Gamarra, a political scientist at Florida International University. \"The economy is the top issue, and second- and third-generation Hispanics are focusing less on immigration and more on wages, jobs, and cost of living.\"But while many Latino voters are pulling away from Trump, they're not returning to the Democratic fold. A July report from Equis Research found that about one-third of Latino Trump voters are now undecided for 2026. Economic concerns remain front and center: 58 percent of Latino voters—including many who supported the president in 2024—believe he is more focused on culture wars and immigrant crackdowns than on lowering the cost of living.Trump's numbers on economic issues have collapsed. His approval rating on the cost of living stands at just 23 percent, with a net disapproval of -50. Even among former supporters, the perception is solidifying that he hasn't delivered on his economic promises.Immigration, long seen as a defining issue for Latino voters, has also shifted. While Trump continues to score high on border security, his aggressive enforcement tactics are now driving away some of his own voters. Among Latinos who regret or feel disappointed in their 2024 vote, large majorities oppose workplace raids, ICE agents in masks and civilian clothes and hardline detention policies. For these voters, Trump's approach to immigration enforcement has become excessive and disconnected from their priorities.Democrats Sense Opening, but Struggle to ActStill, Democrats have failed to turn this discontent into momentum. In the same Equis poll, more Latino swing voters said Democrats \"talk a lot about how dangerous Trump is but don't do anything to stop him\" than said they were offering effective resistance. In competitive congressional districts with large Latino populations, Democrats hold only a narrow lead. Nationally, the party's favorability among Latinos has slipped to +3. In battlegrounds, it's effectively zero.Even voters who once backed Joe Biden and flipped to Trump in 2024 remain skeptical. Half of those \"Biden defectors\" now disapprove of Trump's economic performance, yet they haven't moved back toward the Democrats.\"The biggest takeaway from this research is that neither party should assume they have Latinos in their pocket,\" Equis co-founder Stephanie Valencia told MSNBC columnist Julio Ricardo Varela. \"We're seeing increased cynicism about both parties among key swing voters.\"Valencia said many Latinos supported Trump not out of ideological alignment, but because they were desperate for economic relief. \"But he hasn't delivered,\" she said. \"Democrats will need to offer a proactive plan that actually addresses cost-of-living issues if they want to win these voters back.\"In some parts of the country, those frustrations showed up on the ballot. In Clark County, Nevada, Politico found a 30 percent increase in ballots split between Trump and Democratic House candidates. In Arizona, Senator Ruben Gallego outperformed Vice President Kamala Harris by six points in heavily Latino precincts. In Texas, Democrats did better than the top of the ticket, even as Trump carried the state.Despite the shifting numbers, both parties face an uphill battle. Latino voters haven't forgotten past Democratic failures on immigration reform or the party's slow response on economic issues like wages, housing and health care. And they no longer respond to fear-based appeals centered on Trump's rhetoric.\"The idea that Trump's extremism would be enough to win back these voters was inaccurate in 2024, and it remains so in 2025,\" Varela wrote. \"Latino voters are still watching, but they are no longer waiting.\"Madrid sees a deeper problem for both parties: \"We're watching two parties in transition,\" he said. \"Neither one is winning these voters.\"","summary":"A demographic that shifted toward Trump in 2024 now appears up for grabs heading into the midterms.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/latino-voters-trump-republicans-democrats-2026-midterms-2117379","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2707313/latino-voters-trump.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=e60df7425550b49f36e8dddfa76b898e","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-22 15:05:28","author":"Jesus Mesa","authors":["Jesus Mesa"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.028},{"id":353322918,"title":"CBS denies report of news division losing $50 million a year, insists it is profitable","text":"CBS is pushing back on a report that its news division is losing a staggering $50 million annually, insisting the unit remains profitable. \"A published report that CBS News is losing 'around $50 million a year' is inaccurate.

The company's new owner, David Ellison, made CBS News his first stop once he was handed the keys to Paramount, a sign CBS News staffers interpreted as him prioritizing the house that Walter Cronkite built despite potential budget cuts. CBS and Paramount did not immediately respond when asked about a report that the $50 million figure was leaked to justify possible cuts. New Paramount president Jeff Shell has said upcoming layoffs will be \"painful,\" but promised they'd be done swiftly to avoid staggered quarterly cuts. CBS News president and executive editor Tom Cibrowski, who joined the company in March, has a lot on his plate.

The network has had a tumultuous year, much of it involving President Donald Trump's massive lawsuit against CBS and Paramount. Trump accused CBS News of \"election interference\" over the network's handling of its \"60 Minutes\" interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris, which aired the month before the 2024 election. Shari Redstone, Paramount's former controlling shareholder before the Skydance merger, voiced her stance in favor of settling Trump's lawsuit, hoping it would clear the path for the multi-billion-dollar sale, which could have been halted by Trump's FCC. The FCC approved the transaction shortly after Paramount settled Trump's lawsuit last month. PARAMOUNT, SKYDANCE COMPLETE $8 BILLION MERGER AS FCC CONTINUES CBS PROBE The settlement caused consternation among CBS staffers. Tensions further escalated after CBS announced it was pulling the plug on Colbert's progressive late-night show, calling it a purely financial decision. The cancellation outraged liberal critics, who accused CBS of bending the knee to Trump, but Puck News later reported that \"The Late Show\" was losing more than $40 million a year for CBS and had a budget of more than $100 million per season.

I had always wanted her to go out like a queen.” (Sept. 2)\n\n “The Wilderness,” Angela Flournoy \n\nAngela Flournoy's acclaimed debut, “The Turner House,” was set around an aging family home in Detroit. In “The Wilderness,” she traces the cross-country lives of five Black women from youth to middle age. The author also offers a mini-tour of airports, from the underwhelming sites of landing at Charles de Gaulle in Paris to the view of pyramids in Cairo. A universal truth, she writes: “If the surrounding city has a decent Black population, then a good number of them will be working at the airport.” (Sept. 16)\n\n “107 Days,” Kamala Harris \n\nPublisher Simon & Schuster is promising a compelling campaign memoir from former Vice President Kamala Harris that addresses “everything we would want her to address.” That presumably includes Harris’ thoughts on the mental and physical condition of President Joe Biden, whose decision to withdraw his candidacy led to Harris’ historic, frantic and unsuccessful run against Republican Donald Trump. Harris has called the book, written with the assistance of Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Geraldine Brooks, the result of looking back “with candor and reflection.” (Sept. 23)\n\n “The Loneliness of Sonia and Sunny,” Kiran Desai \n\nKiran Desai's first novel in nearly 20 years, since her Booker Prize-winning “The Inheritance of Loss,” is on the Booker longlist and is also a story of contrasting lives: a successful novelist returning to her native India and a New York-based journalist — a copy editor for, of all places, The Associated Press. (Desai has not yet named a real-life counterpart as inspiration.) Separated by geography, they are connected by the will of their families, who would very much like to arrange a marriage. (Sept. 23)\n\n “Softly, As I Leave You,” Priscilla Presley \n\nPriscilla Presley has been so defined by her years with Elvis that the 2023 biopic “Priscilla” ends with their breakup in 1973. But readers of “Softly, As I Leave You” will learn that she forged a long and successful career on her own. She was Bobby Ewing’s ex-fiancee, Jenna Wade, in “Dallas” and the love interest for Leslie Nielsen in the “Naked Gun” spoofs. (Presley appears briefly in the current remake.) She even revealed a knack for marketing. When Elvis’ Graceland estate was in disrepair in the years following his 1977 death, she opened it to the public and helped make the property among the world’s most popular tourist destinations. Currently in a legal battle with a former business partner, Presley also writes of enduring other tragedies besides the death of her ex-husband, notably the loss of daughter Lisa Marie Presley two years ago. (Sept. 23)\n\n “We Love You, Bunny,” Mona Awad \n\nSix years ago, Canadian author Mona Awad’s bestselling “Bunny” was praised by Margaret Atwood, among others, for its blend of horror and academic satire set around a clique of creative writing students who call each other “Bunny.” In her follow-up novel, onetime outsider Samantha Heather Mackey is herself a bestselling author and the bunnies have a few things to say about her material. “So funny that you described me as a maniacal hair braider,” one of them tells her. “I laughed until I cried blood.” (Sept. 23)\n\n “The Impossible Fortune,” Richard Osman \n\nRichard Osman is an all-around success story, an author, producer and personality who has been a fixture for years in British television. He now enjoys critical acclaim and millions of sales as the creator of the “Thursday Murder Club” mystery novels, in which four pensioners in a retirement community take on cases new and old. The fifth in the series, “The Impossible Fortune,” blends wedding plans and a sudden disappearance that has Osman’s sleuths in search of answers. (Sept. 30)\n\n “Shadow Ticket,” Thomas Pynchon \n\nThomas Pynchon’s latest novel is his first in more than a decade. Now 88, the author most famous for the epic “Gravity's Rainbow” has rarely settled for a simple storyline. Like his comic novel “Inherent Vice,” there's a detective at the center of the narrative, one Hicks McTaggart, who will “find himself also entangled with Nazis, Soviet agents, British counterspies, swing musicians, practitioners of the paranormal, outlaw motorcyclists, and the troubles that come with each of them.” (Oct. 7)\n\n “Unfettered,” John Fetterman \n\nFew Washington legislators are more recognizable than Sen. John Fetterman, the 6-foot-8-inch, hoodie-wearing Pennsylvania Democrat whose physical and mental health struggles and his battles with both Republicans and his own party have kept him in the news since he ran for the Senate in 2022. His publisher, Crown, is calling “Unfettered” a “raw and visceral” and “unapologetic account of his unconventional life.” (Nov. 11)","summary":"Fall is the time for publishers to release their most anticipated literary fiction, and this season will feature new books from Thomas Pynchon, Kiran Desai and Ian McEwan among others","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/lisa-marie-presley-priscilla-presley-kamala-harris-maurice-sendak-arundhati-roy-b2812516.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/22/14/Britain_The_Thursday_Murder_Club_Screening_70760.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-22 13:39:11","author":"Hillel Italie","authors":["Hillel Italie"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.394},{"id":353305562,"title":"Fall is books' biggest season. Expect some long-awaited returns","text":"In the decade since she published her acclaimed debut novel, “The Turner House,” Angela Flournoy has confronted a few delays, welcome and otherwise, en route to completing her second book: her first child, a pandemic, speaking engagements, the occasional essay and, throughout, the challenges of creating a work of imagination. \n\n“With nonfiction, you're usually doing it on a deadline, there's a constraint of time, and when it's over, it's over,” says Flournoy, whose novel “The Wilderness” is out this fall. “When you're working with facts, they're not really malleable. But with novels I create the reality. And the timing is up to me.”\n\nThe upcoming literary season will feature many books you might call long- or eagerly awaited: It will be in part a story of comebacks, completions and follow-ups, with some of the book world's biggest names returning to fiction after absences of a decade or more. \n\nThomas Pynchon's “Shadow Ticket” is his first novel since 2013's “Bleeding Edge.” Kiran Desai's “The Loneliness of Sonia and Sunny” is her first novel since her celebrated “The Inheritance of Loss” came out 20 years ago. Wendell Berry breaks a long absence from fiction with “Marce Catlett,” narrated by his alter ego and fellow Kentuckian, Andy Catlett. George Packer, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author and journalist, will publish his first novel since the 1990s, “The Emergency.” \n\n“The Land of Sweet Forever” compiles stories and essays from the late Harper Lee, who in 2015 stunned the world by authorizing the release of “Go Set a Watchman,” a precursor to her classic “To Kill a Mockingbird.” Fiction also is expected from Patricia Lockwood, Ian McEwan, Thomas McGuane, Gish Jen, Ken Follett and John Irving, while two Booker Prize winners will have memoirs out: Margaret Atwood has written “Book of Lives: A Memoir of Sorts” and Arundhati Roy, best known for “The God of Small Things,” will publish “Mother Mary Comes to Me.”\n\nSome books arrive highly anticipated, even if the wait was relatively short. R.F. Kuang's “Katabasis” is her first novel since the bestselling satire “Yellowface,” which came out in 2023. Megha Majumdar follows her acclaimed debut from 2020, “A Burning,” with “A Guardian and a Thief.” Salman Rushdie’s story collection, “The Eleventh Hour,” is his first book of fiction since he survived a stabbing attack in 2022. \n\n“We Love You Bunny,” the follow-up to Mona Awad’s dark campus satire from 2019, “Bunny,” is a meta-tale of a novelist gone viral. \n\n“No book has stuck with me longer than ‘Bunny.’ I missed the fever-dreamy world of it so much,” Awad wrote in an email. “I think part of the reason had to do with the incredibly creative and rich reader response, which I still can’t believe. It kept the story alive and expanding in my head and I felt compelled to return.”\n\n Thrills, chills, romance \n\n“Gone Before Goodbye” pairs Oscar winner Reese Witherspoon with master thriller writer Harlan Coben. “Da Vinci Code” author Dan Brown brings back protagonist Robert Langdon in “The Secret of Secrets,” and “Exit Strategy” is the latest Jack Reacher novel from brothers Lee and Andrew Child. Richard Osman's “Thursday Murder Club” series continues with “The Impossible Fortune” and Mick Herron has written his ninth “Slough House” book, “Clown Town.” \n\nChild-friendly tension will arrive in a new edition of “Hansel and Gretel,” as written by Stephen King, with illustrations from the archives of the late Maurice Sendak.\n\nNew romance and romantasy is expected from Tessa Bailey, Harley Laroux and Ana Huang, whose “The Defender” is the second book in her “Gods of the Game” series. Ali Hazelwood follows her paranormal hit “Bride” with “Mate” and Brynne Weaver begins the “Seasons of Carnage” series with a tale of serial killers in love, “Tourist Season.” Erin A. Craig, known for such scary tales as “House of Salt and Sorrows,” has written “A Land So Wide.”\n\n Celebrities telling all \n\nPriscilla Presley's “Softly, As I Leave You” continues her story from the memoir “Elvis and Me,” which ended with their breakup and Elvis' death, in 1977. (The book was completed before her current legal battle with a former business partner). Michael J. Fox remembers the '80s in “Future Boy,” Paul McCartney looks back on his post-Beatles work in “Wings” and Patti Smith reflects on childhood, love and grief in “Bread of Angels.” \n\nMemoirs also are coming from Lionel Richie and Anthony Hopkins, Kenny Chesney and Cameron Crowe. Charlie Sheen opens up about his scandalous life in “The Book of Sheen” and Emmy-nominated actor Cheryl Hines, wife of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is scheduled to release “Cheryl Hines Unscripted.”\n\n“With humor, wisdom, and unflinching honesty, Cheryl navigates the highs and lows of fame, family, and an unexpected foray into politics — complete with twists no one saw coming,” the publisher, Skyhorse, describes her book.\n\n A break from Washington \n\nPublishers have said that they didn't expect books on President Donald Trump to have the same appeal as they did during his first term; apart from Jonathan Karl’s election chronicle “Retribution” and Scott Jennings' “A Revolution of Common Sense,” few fall titles center on him and few so far are in the pipeline for 2026. \n\n“Readers are looking more for books on the economy and geopolitical landscape than they are on anything more current in politics,” says Barnes & Noble's director of books, Shannon DeVito, citing Andrew Ross Sorkin's “1929,” about the stock market crash; and Joyce Vance's “Giving Up Is Unforgivable: A Manual for Keeping a Democracy.”\n\nSome prior administrations will be heard from. Former Vice President Kamala Harris has completed “107 Days,” about her hurried 2024 campaign. “Independent: A Look Inside a Broken White House, Outside the Party Lines” is a memoir from a White House press secretary under President Joe Biden, Karine Jean-Pierre, who has since announced her departure from the Democratic Party. Former first lady Michelle Obama's latest looks back on her life — or at least what she has worn — in the illustrated fashion memoir “The Look.”\n\nA handful of books anticipate next year's 250th anniversary of U.S. independence. “The American Revolution: An Intimate History,” by Ken Burns and Geoffrey Ward, is a companion to Burns' upcoming documentary. Walter Isaacson's “The Greatest Sentence Ever Written” looks in depth at the Declaration of Independence. Donald Sassoon's “Revolutions: A New History” documents the worldwide impact of America's break from Britain. Joseph Ellis' “The Great Contradiction” probes the flaws and virtues of Thomas Jefferson and other founders.\n\nOther works will reflect on the war in Gaza, which nears its second anniversary, with releases ranging from former Hamas captive Eli Sharabi's “Hostage” to diary excerpts from Palestinian Plestia Alaqad, “The Eyes of Gaza.”\n\n Poetry old and new \n\n“The New Book” compiles final words from poet Nikki Giovanni, who died last year. Ada Limón's “Startlement” is her first collection since her term as U.S. poet laureate ended last spring, while former laureate Billy Collins is releasing “Dog Show,” which features watercolor drawings by Pamela Sztybel.\n\n“The Poems of Seamus Heaney” collects all of the work by the late Nobel laureate and “Only Sing” features more than 100 unpublished works by the late John Berryman.

His remarks will be key for the US economy","text":"ReutersFed chair Jerome Powell Jackson Hole speech 2025\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell Jackson Hole speech: Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is set to deliver his widely anticipated speech at the Jackson Hole symposium on Friday morning, a moment many investors are watching closely to see if he signals an interest rate cut as soon as next month, as per a report.But beyond the immediate question of rate moves, Powell’s speech will address two much bigger issues shaping the future of the central bank and his legacy as chair, as per a Yahoo Finance report.Divided Views Among Fed Officials on Rate CutsAs the debate over the economy and possible rate cuts heats up, Powell faces a divided views among Fed officials, according to the report. Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid and Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack expressed caution on the need for interest rate cuts, saying current inflation data doesn’t yet justify cutting rates, as per the Yahoo Finance report.ALSO READ: Are Apple, OpenAI, Google, Meta, and Amazon plotting to take down state AI regulations?Hammack explained that, \"There's a lot of data we're going to get between now and September, and I walk into every meeting with an open mind about what the right thing to do is,\" adding, \"But with the data I have right now, and with the information I have, if the meeting was tomorrow, I would not see a case for reducing interest rates,\" as quoted in the report.Live EventsMeanwhile, other Fed officials like Michelle Bowman and Chris Waller have been more vocal about the need for rate cuts, as per the report. As of early Friday, investors were assigning roughly a 69% chance of a 0.25% cut on September 17, according to Yahoo Finance.Political Pressure Surrounding the Federal ReservePowell’s speech will also come amid political tensions, with US president Donald Trump recently urging Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook to resign over controversy involving two mortgage loans, as per the report. The Department of Justice reportedly sent Powell a letter urging Cook’s removal, according to the report. Trump, who has called Powell “Too Late” for not cutting rates sooner, has regularly criticized Fed policy and pushed for lower interest rates than the current 4.25%-4.50% benchmark, as reported by Yahoo Finance. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also recently suggested the Fed should consider a 0.50% cut in September, according to the Yahoo Finance report.ALSO READ: Kamala Harris’ 107 Days book tour: Dates, cities, what to expect and when to get ticketsJerome Powell Stresses Importance of Fed IndependenceDespite these pressures, Powell emphasized last month the importance of an independent Fed, saying, \"I think that having an independent central bank has been an institutional arrangement that has served the public well,\" adding, \"And as long as it serves the public well, it should continue and be respected,\" as quoted in the report.Major Changes Expected in Fed’s Inflation Targeting StrategyIn addition to the rate outlook, Powell is expected to announce changes to the Fed’s policy framework, particularly signaling an end to average inflation targeting, as per the Yahoo Finance report. This policy, introduced before the pandemic when inflation was low, allowed the Fed to tolerate inflation running above 2% to make up for prior shortfalls below that level, according to the report. There is expectation that Fed would likely shift back to focusing on a straight 2% inflation target, as per the Yahoo Finance report. During a speech in May, Powell said \"The economic environment has changed significantly since 2020, and our review will reflect our assessment of those changes,” as quoted in the report.ALSO READ: After billion-dollar hirings, Zuckerberg slams brakes on Meta’s AI hiring spree as bubble fears shake Silicon ValleyFAQsAre interest rates expected to be cut soon?Investors expect a 69% chance of a 0.25% cut in September, but some Fed officials remain cautious, as per the Yahoo Finance report.Why is Jerome Powell’s speech so important?It may reveal the Fed’s plans on interest rates and outline major changes in policy that affect the economy for years.(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onFed Chair Jerome Powell Jackson Hole speechJerome Powell Jackson Hole speechFederal Reserve interest rate cutsUS economy outlookeconomy inflation targetingFed policy framework changesFederal Reserve interest rate cutFederal Reserve monetary policy changesDonald Trump Fed criticism\n\n(Catch all the US News, UK News, Canada News, International Breaking News Events, and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid and Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack expressed caution on the need for interest rate cuts, saying current inflation data doesn’t yet justify cutting rates, as per the Yahoo Finance report.ALSO READ: Are Apple, OpenAI, Google, Meta, and Amazon plotting to take down state AI regulations?Hammack explained that, \"There's a lot of data we're going to get between now and September, and I walk into every meeting with an open mind about what the right thing to do is,\" adding, \"But with the data I have right now, and with the information I have, if the meeting was tomorrow, I would not see a case for reducing interest rates,\" as quoted in the report.Live EventsMeanwhile, other Fed officials like Michelle Bowman and Chris Waller have been more vocal about the need for rate cuts, as per the report. As of early Friday, investors were assigning roughly a 69% chance of a 0.25% cut on September 17, according to Yahoo Finance.Political Pressure Surrounding the Federal ReservePowell’s speech will also come amid political tensions, with US president Donald Trump recently urging Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook to resign over controversy involving two mortgage loans, as per the report. The Department of Justice reportedly sent Powell a letter urging Cook’s removal, according to the report. Trump, who has called Powell “Too Late” for not cutting rates sooner, has regularly criticized Fed policy and pushed for lower interest rates than the current 4.25%-4.50% benchmark, as reported by Yahoo Finance. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also recently suggested the Fed should consider a 0.50% cut in September, according to the Yahoo Finance report.ALSO READ: Kamala Harris’ 107 Days book tour: Dates, cities, what to expect and when to get ticketsJerome Powell Stresses Importance of Fed IndependenceDespite these pressures, Powell emphasized last month the importance of an independent Fed, saying, \"I think that having an independent central bank has been an institutional arrangement that has served the public well,\" adding, \"And as long as it serves the public well, it should continue and be respected,\" as quoted in the report.Major Changes Expected in Fed’s Inflation Targeting StrategyIn addition to the rate outlook, Powell is expected to announce changes to the Fed’s policy framework, particularly signaling an end to average inflation targeting, as per the Yahoo Finance report. This policy, introduced before the pandemic when inflation was low, allowed the Fed to tolerate inflation running above 2% to make up for prior shortfalls below that level, according to the report. There is expectation that Fed would likely shift back to focusing on a straight 2% inflation target, as per the Yahoo Finance report. During a speech in May, Powell said \"The economic environment has changed significantly since 2020, and our review will reflect our assessment of those changes,” as quoted in the report.ALSO READ: After billion-dollar hirings, Zuckerberg slams brakes on Meta’s AI hiring spree as bubble fears shake Silicon ValleyFAQsAre interest rates expected to be cut soon?Investors expect a 69% chance of a 0.25% cut in September, but some Fed officials remain cautious, as per the Yahoo Finance report.Why is Jerome Powell’s speech so important?It may reveal the Fed’s plans on interest rates and outline major changes in policy that affect the economy for years.(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onpowell speech todayFed Chair Jerome Powell Jackson Hole speechJerome Powell Jackson Hole speechUS economy outlookFederal Reserve monetary policy changeswhat time is powell speaking at jackson holewhat time does powell speak at jackson holejerome powell speech todaypowell jackson hole speechfed rate cuts\n\n(Catch all the US News, UK News, Canada News, International Breaking News Events, and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

Bonta has no need for to lay low any longer, unless he sincerely doesn’t want the job. In a wide but weak field, Bonta stands out as likely the strongest candidate.\n\n“Kamala Harris would be a great governor,” Bonta said of a prospective Harris run early on. … “I would support her if she ran, I’ve always supported her in everything she’s done. She would be field‑clearing.”\n\nInstead, Harris has now cleared the field for what proves to be the most openly competitive run for California governor in generations. It’s hard to remember a more open race in the modern era, when there always seems to have been an obvious successor waiting in the wings whenever a gubernatorial campaign came up.\n\nThere is no such successor this time, though, no Gavin Newsom waiting for Jerry Brown to get out of the way, no Brown waiting for Arnold Schwarzenegger’s departure and no Schwarzenegger waiting to oust Gray Davis in a recall election, to name just a few recent runs for governor.\n\nRemembering the achievements of the current crop of gubernatorial candidates is hard. The first newly named frontrunner, Orange County’s former U.S. Rep. Katie Porter, was a tough questioner in Congress, but try to name a singular achievement.\n\nReal estate developer Rick Caruso, who lost a 2022 run for mayor of Los Angeles, seems more focused on criticizing the current mayor than running for governor. The top achievement of former state Senate President Toni Atkins, of San Diego, seems to have been becoming the first lesbian occupant of that office.\n\nThere’s also former state controller Betty Yee, who lacks a singular achievement too. Then there’s former Los Angeles Mayor and state Assembly speaker Antonio Villaraigosa, whose achievements seem lost in the winds of time, because he’s been out of office raking in private payments for services so long.\n\nNot to be forgotten is Xavier Becerra, once the elected attorney general of California and later a Joe Biden cabinet officer. He was President Trump’s prime legal antagonist during Trump’s first term, filing more than 100 lawsuits and greatly impeding the Trump agenda.\n\nAlso there was Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis, who has the usual nonmemorable achievements of any recent lieutenant governor. Kounalakis, however, announced Aug. 8 that she was dropping out of the governor’s race to run instead for state treasurer.\n\nAmong the Republicans, there is Steve Hilton, who is best known as a Fox News host, accompanied by Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco, best known for his resistance to COVID-19 measures.\n\nThat leaves Rob Bonta, the appointed and then elected attorney general who has been the point man in California’s efforts to resist some of the most egregious edicts of President Trump. Bonta, with nearly 40 lawsuits filed so far against Trump measures, is ahead of Becerra’s pace, and his aggressive demeanor in opposing Trump appears to be what California voters want.\n\nThat, at least, is what we can glean from the behavior of current Gov. Newsom, who puts on the most aggressive front he can in opposing Trump, presumably because that’s what he believes will best feed the preferences of his base. His latest move is to attempt a gerrymandering effort aimed to parry — at least — an effort by Texas Republicans to “steal” five currently Democratic Texas seats in Congress. Newsom announced Aug. 14 that the state will hold a November special election to approve redrawn districts meant to give Democrats five more U.S. House seats.\n\nBonta has not yet said much about running for governor, because he seemed to deeply believe Harris would do that job. Since she now says she won’t, though, look for Bonta to take on a very active campaign role, just as he has lately been Trump’s leading legal antagonist.\n\nBonta’s fought Trump over the federal demands for welfare recipients’ IDs, and he’s fought firings at various federal departments. He’s fought against new voting instructions and for offshore wind energy. It’s hard to find an area where he has not stood against Trump, and if that kind of behavior is really what Californians want, expect him to become the front-runner very soon.\n\nEmail Thomas Elias at tdelias@aol.com, and read more of his columns online at californiafocus.net.","summary":"The state's attorney general stands out as the likely strongest candidate in a wide but weak field.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/08/22/elias-bonta-may-soon-become-front-runner-for-california-governor/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/RPE-L-GHOST-1003-1-01.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-22 12:00:41","author":"Thomas Elias","authors":["Thomas Elias"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.044},{"id":353259294,"title":"Europe Embraces Death, Trump Keeps America Fighting","text":"The following content is sponsored by Americans for Limited Government.\n\nThe elites love to praise Europe—its universal health care, its 36-hour work weeks, its tastefully curated despair. But they never talk about what Europe really exports now: assisted suicide.\n\nCountries across Western Europe are legalizing assisted dying. The United Kingdom drew headlines for its pro-suicide laws recently, but such laws already exist in Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg, Spain and elsewhere. Switzerland has actual suicide pods. The Netherlands and Belgium both legalized euthanasia as far back as 2002. And people are literally dying to take advantage. In Belgium, there were more than 3,400 cases of euthanasia in 2023, up 15 percent from 2022. And the Netherlands had more than 9,000 euthanasia cases that same year, up 87 percent since 2013!\n\nThese cases aren’t limited to 90-year-olds with terminal cancer. young Netherlanders are now killing themselves with state assistance. Europe, at least Western Europe, has lost the will to live.\n\nMeanwhile, America continues to fight for life, liberty and opportunity, which is why the United States rejects the right to die and instead embraces the right to try.\n\nIn May 2018, President Trump signed into law the Right to Try Act, which enables those with terminal diagnoses to obtain experimental drugs that have passed Phase 1 trials but have not yet been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has strict guidelines about clinical trials that are probably correct in many instances, but not for those with no other hope.\n\nAlthough most Democrats voted against this life-saving bill, 41 states had previously passed their own Right to Try legislation, starting with Colorado in 2014.\n\nThe president’s support for innovative medical care is part of the Make American Biotech Accelerate (MABA) initiative he’s unleashed in his second term. America has always led the world in developing new medicines; in some years, for example, the U.S. invents more new prescription drugs than the rest of the world combined.\n\nIt is critical for the U.S. to maintain this leadership position, especially given China’s rapid growth in this arena. China’s state-subsidized clinical trials continue to accelerate: total clinical trial involvement by China soared to 300 percent from 2017 to 2023, capturing a third globally. America cannot afford to surrender biotech dominance to the government that exports fentanyl and the coronavirus; nor can we follow Europe’s state-sponsored capitulation to death, like socialized medicine, government price setting and death panels.\n\nPrice controls are disastrous, both in the short and long term. Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris all endorsed adopting European drug price controls, also known as Most Favored Nation (MFN) or International Reference Drug Pricing. If our government destroys incentives for developing new medicines by adopting MFN, it will destroy the cures of the future.\n\nPresident Trump has committed to making Europe pay its fair share for American drugs, just as he did with defense spending in NATO. Trump forcing other countries to pay the same percentage of their GDP for innovative medicines that the U.S. pays will not only equalize the playing field – it will also give patients access to “Wonder Drugs” and save lives while lowering drug prices here at home.\n\nAmerica must stay committed to our Right to Try and not tie what we pay for medicines to countries that believe in the right to die. European governments do not value life the way Americans do. We shouldn’t import their failed ideas. Making American Biotech Accelerate is good for both us and the rest of the world.\n\nEurope can keep its suicide pods. Under President Trump’s leadership, America will keep making the miracle drugs of the 21st century.","summary":"The elites love to praise Europe—its universal health care, its 36-hour work weeks, its tastefully curated despair.

The states are led by two of his biggest Democratic foes: Govs. JB Pritzker (D-IL) and Gavin Newsom (D-CA).\n\n“If we need to, we’re going to do the same thing in Chicago, which is a disaster. We have a mayor there who’s totally incompetent,” Trump said of Johnson. “And we have an incompetent governor there. Pritzker is an incompetent. His family threw him out of the business, and he ran for governor.”\n\nSTEPHEN MILLER BLASTS ‘STUPID WHITE HIPPIES’ DURING UNION STATION VISIT WITH VANCE AND HEGSETH\n\n“Hopefully, LA is watching,” Trump added as he spoke about the devastating fires that blazed through the city earlier this year. “I watched people on television; they want to go, they want to leave. They’ve lost their spirit. They’ve lost their heart because the mayor is incompetent. And Gavin Newscum [Trump’s nickname for Newsom] is incompetent. Got a good line of bull****, but that’s about it.”\n\nOn Thursday, the president was again direct about his desire to move beyond Washington when asked about homicides in Memphis, Tennessee, another blue-controlled city. “We’re doing a sort of a test right now in D.C.,” he told the Todd Starnes Show. “It’s working unbelievably.”\n\nHe later visited the U.S. Park Police Anacostia Operations Facility on Thursday evening, highlighting the National Guard’s work to combat crime and homelessness.\n\n“The crime numbers are way down,” Trump told the crowd. “I feel very safe now, and I’m hearing people are very safe, but I know within two weeks … it’s going to be at a level that’s even far superior.”\n\nHe again threatened to take his efforts to crack down on crime to other cities. “We’re not playing games. We’re going to make it safe, and we’re going to then go on to other places,” he said. “But we’re going to stay here for a while.”\n\nTrump’s attacks on these blue cities and their leaders are part of a yearslong pattern of slamming urban enclaves as crime-infested places in need of law and order. His recent takeover of Washington escalates his previous feuds with Democrats, who claimed that crime rates have fallen in many of these cities.\n\n“President Trump sees that American cities are failing, and part of why they’re failing is a leadership deficit and a lack of will to do what needs to be done to fix these once great American cities,” said Brian Seitchick, a national Republican strategist. “So Trump is taking it upon himself to make cities safer again and to make them a place that is hospitable to all Americans.” \n\nIn his first visit to Chicago as president in 2019, Trump said the Windy City was “embarrassing to us as a nation” due to its crime problems. “All over the world, they’re talking about Chicago. Afghanistan is a safe place by comparison,” he said.\n\nDuring a visit to Detroit, Michigan, last year while campaigning for the presidency, Trump said the nation would end up like the city if former Vice President Kamala Harris were president.\n\n“The whole country will be like — you want to know the truth? It’ll be like Detroit,” Trump said. “Our whole country will end up being like Detroit if she’s your president.”\n\nHowever, in his second term, Trump no longer relies on harsh rhetoric. He’s now using the federal government’s full might to enforce his will.\n\n“President Trump wants every innocent, law-abiding American across the country to be safe – no matter what city they live in or who is in charge,” said Taylor Rogers, a White House spokesperson, in a statement to the Washington Examiner. \n\n“President Trump is delivering on his campaign promise to make DC Safe and Beautiful by using his lawful authority to stop dangerous criminals and enforce the law,” Rogers continued. “The left and the media can coddle criminals, but our nation’s capital will not be a safe haven for violent criminals under President Trump’s leadership.” \n\nMembers of the Trump administration have applauded the National Guard for helping clean up the city’s homeless crisis and violent crime problems, as well as pointed to the effect it could have on the nation after Trump declared a national emergency to take over the police department for 30 days.\n\n“We do not have to allow our cities to be taken over by violence,” Vice President JD Vance said during a surprise visit to Union Station on Wednesday. “We can bring law and order to our communities, you’ve just got to have the political willpower to do it.”\n\nRep. James Comer (R-KY), a key Trump ally on Capitol Hill, publicly supported the takeover of other cities’ police forces. \n\n“We’re gonna support doing this in other cities if it works out in Washington, D.C.,” he told Newsmax. Our military has been in many countries around the world for the past two decades, walking the streets trying to reduce crime in other countries. We need to focus on the big cities in America now, and that’s what the president is doing.”\n\nDemocrats are in a bind on how to counter Trump’s attacks on blue-leaning cities, said one Republican strategist.\n\n“This puts Democrats in a corner, and so in that way, I think Trump loves it,” said Matt Dole, a GOP strategist based in Ohio. “I think Trump loves it when he can sort of corner the Democrats. And really, whatever they decide is a problem for them. And I think he has them in the corner. Crime nationally is worse in big cities. Big cities nationally are unanimously controlled by Democrats.”\n\nFBI crime statistics from 2024 show that 13 of the 20 cities with the highest murder rates were in Republican-run states. But 19 of the 20 cities with the highest murder rates, with at least 100,000 residents, were led by Democratic mayors. Trump’s feud with these Democratic leaders may have some basis for his threats to move beyond Washington, but the crime statistics also lend credence to the argument that Democrats are not tough on crime.\n\n“I believe he is targeting cities that are failing, and that these cities fail the eye test on a regular basis,” said Seitchick. “If they were led by Republicans, with Republican mayors, and they were failing, Trump would still be trying to fix them. The fact that Democrats leave them at the city level and the gubernatorial level is a reality that everybody understands.” \n\nTRUMP’S TAKEOVER OF DC POLICE RENEWS THE 51ST STATE DEBATE\n\nDole pointed out that Washington is unique in that it lacks statehood and is, therefore, more easily subject to federal jurisdiction.\n\n“I don’t think Trump goes, ‘Look, this worked in D.C., so now I’m going to nationalize the LAPD or the Chicago Police or something else, ‘” said Dole. “I think Trump explores limits, but I believe he knows that that’s probably a step too far and would certainly be struck down in court relatively quickly.”","summary":"When President Donald Trump announced his plans to federalize the Metropolitan Police Department earlier this month, he included a not-so-subtle threat to liberal cities beyond Washington: either clean up or face the threat of a federal takeover. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to have a tremendous success on what we&#8217;re doing,&#8221; Trump said regarding the enlistment of the [&#8230;]","url":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/white-house/3762417/trump-blue-city-feud-national-guard-washington-dc-takeover/","image":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/trump-rail-funding.webp?w=696","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-22 11:00:00","author":"Mabinty Quarshie","authors":["Mabinty Quarshie"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.295},{"id":353258250,"title":"Midterm map attracts wave of defeated Senate candidates","text":"On the GOP side, former congressman Mike Rogers announced he is running in April after losing a Senate race in Michigan by less than one percentage point.\n\nThe trend is not limited to candidates who mounted failed runs last year. Scott Brown, a former Massachusetts senator, will run in New Hampshire after unsuccessful campaigns for Senate more than a decade ago. Meanwhile, state GOP Treasurer John Fleming, who lost a 2016 Senate primary in Louisiana, is rechallenging his party this time to unseat Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA).\n\nIn some cases, the candidates are top recruits for their party, which gives them a fighting chance to reclaim seats in next year’s battlegrounds. That’s the bet Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) is making on Sherrod Brown, who outran Vice President Kamala Harris and was the only statewide Democrat left in Ohio.\n\nBut there’s bad news for the candidates hoping to regain their seats. Since 1913, when states began choosing senators by direct popular vote, just 17 who lost were later reelected to the upper chamber, according to an analysis by Eric Ostermeier, who runs data-based reporting site Smart Politics.\n\nIf either Brown were to win their bids, they would be the first example of a Senate election rebound since Washington Republican Slade Gorton in 1988, per Ostermeier.\n\nUltimately, both parties see upsides to running defeated candidates, including their statewide name ID and established fundraising networks, which are crucial to winning competitive races. Allred could face a primary challenge from another Democrat, including Beto O’Rourke, after having the field largely to himself in 2024, but in other races, party leadership has helped clear the primary for their recruits. Rogers, for example, is running unopposed for the GOP nomination.\n\nIn Michigan, Republican operatives consider the battleground a “top-tier” race this cycle, given the 2026 map’s smaller size. Rogers won’t have to compete for national GOP resources like in 2024 with West Virginia and Montana, where Republicans flipped blue seats crucial to retaking Senate control.\n\nThere is concern about whether Rogers can win without Trump’s coattails, but Republicans believe they have a campaign strategy that can tap into his base.\n\n“Trump 2024 gave us a road map over low-propensity voters. Rogers has the benefit of learning from that,” a source familiar with the Rogers campaign told reporters this summer. “We know who these voters are and what messages worked.”\n\nIn some cases, the election margins were narrow enough for candidates to argue that this time around, things would be different.\n\nRogers lost last year to now-Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-MI) by just 0.3 points, and currently gets to campaign in general election mode as a competitive Democratic primary to replace retiring Sen. Gary Peters (D-MI) plays out.\n\nBrown, of Ohio, was unseated by Sen. Bernie Moreno (R-OH) by roughly 3.5 points and is now challenging Sen. Jon Husted (R-OH).\n\nBrown, of Massachusetts, is somewhat of an exception as he’s lost twice in two different states: the first in 2012 in Massachusetts, when he was ousted by now-Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and the second in 2014 in New Hampshire, when he lost to Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH). Brown lost to Shaheen, who’s retiring, by a little more than three points.\n\nOthers suffered wider margins of defeat.\n\nOsborn lost to Fischer by just under 7 points but proved themselves to be a more formidable candidate in a ruby red state than Republicans initially anticipated. He’s now running against Sen. Pete Ricketts (R-NE).\n\nAllred faced off against Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) last year and lost by 8.5 points. The Democratic primary winner will face either Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) or state Attorney General Ken Paxton, who is challenging Cornyn for the GOP nomination. \n\nFleming is primarying Cassidy, who has the endorsement of national Republicans like Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD), but Trump has so far not waded into the race. Fleming lost the 2016 Senate GOP primary to now-Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA).\n\nGiven Louisiana’s heavy Republican tilt, Fleming is by default the “best situated to win a general election of all these retread candidates, but will first need to defeat an extremely well-funded incumbent in the Louisiana GOP primary,” Ostermeier told the Washington Examiner.\n\nAt the same time, both parties are using the candidates’ previous losses to paint them as failed and unelectable rivals.\n\nREPUBLICANS PUSH THE LIMITS TO REVAMP CAMPAIGN FINANCE OPERATIONS\n\nMoreno noted recently that Sherrod Brown “already lost” and suggested he “just retire with dignity.”\n\nIn New Hampshire’s race, Senate Democrats’ campaign arm said Republicans were “resorting to a candidate Granite Staters have already rejected” with Scott Brown’s candidacy.\n\nMarisa Schultz contributed to this report.","summary":"A slew of candidates who lost high-profile Senate races last year are asking voters to give them another shot with the midterm elections around the corner.

Previous polls showed that her candidacy in the race would have had a field-clearing effect.Since the former vice president's potential candidacy overshadowed the governor's race for months, her exit leaves the field wide open.What To KnowIn a head-to-head contest, Porter led with 21 percent of voters. That is up from Politico's previous poll, conducted at the beginning of June, which showed Porter with 6 percent in a head-to-head matchup.In the latest poll, Becerra and Villaraigosa were tied at 9 percent, up from 2 and 4 percent, respectively. Incumbent Lieutenant Governor Eleni Kounalakis followed with 7 percent. Former state Controller Betty Yee and developer Rick Caruso had 6 percent each. Former legislative leader Toni Atkins had 4 percent. State Superintendent Tony Thurmond and entrepreneur Stephen J. Cloobeck had 2 percent.Kounalakis has since exited the race to run for state treasurer.Porter attracted the most support from white and Asian voters and from respondents who ranked housing as their top policy concern. She also performed best with Hispanic voters.On the Republican side, Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco led with 15 percent, up from 4 percent last time. He was ahead of former Fox News host Steve Hilton at 10 percent. Hilton performed best with boomers, second only to Porter, but Bianco drew stronger overall support among registered Republicans.Porter entered the race on March 11 and has led the pack of Democratic candidates vying for the primary win. Still, she and other candidates were held back as speculation fomented for months that Harris was toying with the idea of campaigning for the governor's mansion. Porter repeatedly said Harris would have a \"powerful field-clearing effect\" if she entered the race.With Harris out, Porter's visibility has proved decisive. Jack Citrin, a political science professor at UC Berkeley and partner on the poll, told Politico that Porter benefited from her high-profile Senate run last year against Adam Schiff, which drew wide media attention. \"Visibility is a big factor in a low-information environment,\" Citrin said.The survey was conducted between July 28 and August 12 among 875 voters and had a margin of error of 2.6 percent.Another poll, conducted by Emerson College in early August, also showed Porter as the front-runner in the race after Harris dropped out. \"With Kamala Harris officially out of the race, Katie Porter has emerged as the Democratic front-runner, increasing her support from 12 percent to 18 percent since the April Emerson poll,\" said Spencer Kimball, the executive director of Emerson College Polling.Following Porter were Hilton at 12 percent, Bianco at 7 percent and Villaraigosa at 5 percent. Hilton was not included in the April poll, while Bianco polled at 4 percent and Villaraigosa's share of the vote was unchanged at 5 percent. The poll also showed that the share of undecided voters dropped from 54 percent to 38 percent over the summer.What People Are SayingJack Citrin, a political science professor at UC Berkeley, told Politico: \"[Porter's] gains from Harris are probably a combination of just being better known and having a clear ideological stamp. She has a particular progressive stamp—more than the other two guys—and I think that's part of her appeal.\"What Happens NextCalifornia's gubernatorial election is scheduled to take place on November 3, 2026.Governor Gavin Newsom, who is term-limited from running in the election, is believed to be a contender for the 2028 Democratic nomination for president.

As the cameras rolled, he offered a stark message about crime, an issue he’s been hammering for decades, as he thanked them for their efforts.\n\n“We’re not playing games,” he said. “We’re going to make it safe. And we’re going to then go on to other places.”\n\nThe Republican president is proudly promoting the work of roughly 2,000 National Guard troops in the city, loaned by allied governors from at least six Republican-led states. They’re in place to confront what Trump describes as an out-of-control crime wave in the Democratic-run city, though violent crime in Washington, like dozens of cities led by Democrats, has been down significantly since a pandemic high.\n\nTrump and his allies are confident that his stunning decision to dispatch troops to a major American city is a big political winner almost certain to remind voters of why they elected him last fall.\n\nDemocrats say this is a fight they’re eager to have.\n\nMaryland Gov. Wes Moore, an Army veteran, cast Trump’s move as a dangerous political stunt designed to distract the American people from his inability to address persistent inflation, rising energy prices and major health insurance cuts, among other major policy challenges.\n\n“I’m deeply offended, as someone who’s actually worn the uniform, that he would use the lives of these men and women and the activation of these men and women as political pawns,” Moore told The Associated Press.\n\nTrump’s extraordinary federal power grab comes as the term-limited president has threatened to send troops to other American cities led by Democrats, even as voters voice increasing concern about his authoritarian tendencies. And it could be a factor for both sides in elections in Virginia and New Jersey this fall — and next year’s more consequential midterms.\n\nInside the White House strategy\n\nThe president and White House see Trump’s decision to take over the D.C. police department as a political boon and have been eager to publicize the efforts.\n\nThe White House offered a livestream of Trump’s Thursday evening appearance, and on Wednesday, Vice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth made a surprise visit to Union Station, D.C.’s busy transit hub, to thank members of the National Guard over Shake Shack burgers.\n\nEach morning, Trump’s press office distributes statistics outlining the previous night’s law enforcement actions, including total arrests and how many of those people are in the country illegally.\n\nThe strategy echoes Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration, which has often forced Democrats to come to the defense of people living in the country illegally, including some who have committed serious crimes.\n\nA White House official, speaking on background to discuss internal deliberations, dismissed concerns about perceptions of federal overreach in Washington, saying public safety is a fundamental requirement and a priority for residents.\n\nTrump defended his efforts during an interview on “The Todd Starnes Show” Thursday.\n\n“Because I sent in people to stop crime, they said, ‘He’s a dictator.’ The real people, though, even Democrats, are calling me and saying, ‘It’s unbelievable’ how much it has helped,” he said.\n\nThe White House hopes to use its actions in D.C. as a test case to inspire changes in other cities, though Trump has legal power to intervene in Washington that he doesn’t have elsewhere because the city is under partial federal control.\n\n“Everyday Americans who support commonsense policies would deem the removal of more than 600 dangerous criminals from the streets of our nation’s capital a huge success,” said White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers. “The Democrats continue to be wildly unpopular because they oppose efforts to stop violent crime and protect law-abiding citizens.”\n\nDemocrats lean in\n\nMoore, Maryland’s Democratic governor, suggested a dark motivation behind Trump’s approach, which is focused almost exclusively on cities with large minority populations led by Democratic mayors of color.\n\n“Once again, we are seeing how these incredibly dangerous and biased tropes are being used about these communities by someone who is not willing to step foot in them, but is willing to stand in the Oval Office and defend them,” Moore said.\n\nEven before Trump called the National Guard to Washington, Democratic mayors across the country have been touting their success in reducing violent crime.\n\nCleveland Mayor Justin Bibb, who leads the Democratic Mayors Association, noted that over half of the 70 largest Democratic-led cities in the country have seen violent crime decrease so far this year.\n\n“He’s stoking racial division and stoking fear and chaos,” Bibb said. “We need someone who wants to be a collaborator, not a dictator.”\n\nDemocratic strategists acknowledge that Trump’s GOP has enjoyed a significant advantage in recent years on the issues of crime and immigration — issues Trump has long sought to connect. But as Democratic officials push back against the federal takeover in Washington, party strategists are offering cautious optimism that Trump’s tactics will backfire.\n\n“This is an opportunity for the party to go on offense on an issue that has plagued us for a long time,” said veteran Democratic strategist Daniel Wessel. “The facts are on our side.”\n\nA closer look at the numbers\n\nFBI statistics released this month show murder and nonnegligent manslaughter in the U.S. in 2024 fell nearly 15% from a year earlier, continuing a decline that’s been seen since a coronavirus pandemic-era crime spike.\n\nMeanwhile, recent public polling shows that Republicans have enjoyed an advantage over Democrats on the issue of crime.\n\nA CNN/SSRS poll conducted in May found that about 4 in 10 U.S. adults said the Republican Party’s views were closer to their own on crime and policing, while 3 in 10 said they were more aligned with Democrats’ views. About 3 in 10 said neither party reflected their opinions. Other polls conducted in the past few years found a similar gap.\n\nTrump also had a significant edge over Democrat Kamala Harris on the issue in the 2024 election. About half of voters said Trump was better able to handle crime.\n\nAt the same time, Americans have expressed more concern about the scope of presidential power since Trump took office for a second time in January.\n\nAn AP-NORC poll conducted in April found that about half of U.S. adults said the president has “too much” power in the way the U.S. government operates these days, up from 32% in March 2024.\n\nThe unusual military presence in a U.S. city, which featured checkpoints across Washington staffed in some cases by masked federal agents, injected a sense of fear and chaos into daily life for some people in the nation’s capital.\n\nAt least one day care center was closed Thursday as childcare staff feared the military action, which has featured a surge in immigration enforcement, while local officials raised concerns about next week’s public school openings.\n\nMoore said he would block any push by Trump to send the National Guard into Baltimore.\n\n“I have not seen anything or any conditions on the ground that I think would justify the mobilization of our National Guard,” he said. “They think they’re winning the political argument. I don’t give a s—- about the political argument.”\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

Briscoe Cain, R-Deer Park, kicked off the frenzy Thursday, filing a declaration of candidacy for the newly drawn 9th Congressional District, anchored east of Houston. That seat, currently held by Democratic Rep. Al Green, was moved from southern Houston to the eastern parts of Harris County and Liberty County, going from a district that voted for Kamala Harris by 44 percentage points to one that Donald Trump would have carried by 20 points.\n\nBut with three of the newly created seats lacking an incumbent and two South Texas districts redrawn to be more favorable to Republicans, operatives expect a flurry of candidates to jump into races that Trump hopes yield five new GOP members of Congress.\n\nSouth Texas\n\nRepublicans were targeting two South Texas seats held by Democrats even before the map was redrawn to fold more GOP voters into those districts.\n\nTexas’ 28th Congressional District, centered in Laredo, and the 34th Congressional District, which includes Brownsville and McAllen, were two of just 13 districts nationwide to elect a congressional Democrat while being carried by Trump. Reps. Henry Cuellar, D-Laredo, and Vicente Gonzalez, D-McAllen — two of the House’s most moderate Democrats — were able to hang on to their heavily Hispanic seats in 2024.\n\nUnder the current boundaries, the 28th District voted for Trump by a 7-point margin, while Trump carried the 34th District by 4.5 percentage points. Both were redrawn to be seats that Trump would have won by 10 points.\n\nCuellar’s district lost Democratic-leaning precincts in the San Antonio area and picked up Live Oak County and a sliver of Hidalgo County, including parts of McAllen and areas west of the city. Gonzalez lost his portion of McAllen and Hidalgo County, instead gaining much of conservative Nueces County and its biggest city, Corpus Christi.\n\nThose two districts were already on the National Republican Campaign Committee’s target list — meaning the nominees will receive ample resources — and had attracted challengers. Former Rep. Mayra Flores, who lost to Gonzalez in 2022 and 2024, switched to run in Cuellar’s district — though operatives and Gonzalez have speculated she could switch back to the 34th.\n\nBut Republicans are also excited about Eric Flores, an army veteran and lawyer from Mission who launched his campaign in July.\n\nIn Cuellar’s district, Webb County Judge Tano Tijerina has formed an exploratory committee, a formal step toward launching a run in the 28th District. Tijerina, a former Democrat, switched parties after the 2024 election. He had been a Democratic county judge for nearly a decade.\n\nBecause of Texas’ resign-to-run law, Tijerina would need to step down from his county judge job if he launches a formal congressional campaign with more than one year and 30 days left in his term.\n\nSan Antonio\n\nSeveral local elected officials in San Antonio are thinking about running in the newly drawn 35th Congressional District, which includes parts of San Antonio and outlying eastern areas in Bexar, Guadalupe, Wilson and Karnes counties, the latter three of which are heavily Republican.\n\nThe new seat, cobbled together from pieces of five current congressional seats, would have voted for Trump by a 10-point margin had it existed in 2024.\n\nGrant Moody, the only Republican on the Bexar County Commissioners Court, said in a statement that he is exploring a congressional bid in the new district.\n\n“Texans are known for our hard work, devotion to selfless service, and conservative values — and they deserve to be represented by someone who shares those ideals,” Moody said. “I’ve always felt called to serve my community and country, and these new maps present a unique opportunity to continue serving.”\n\nSan Antonio City Council member Marc Whyte, whose district in San Antonio’s North Side is part of the new 35th District, is also exploring a bid. Though the City Council is nonpartisan, Whyte, an attorney first elected in 2023, represents the only conservative-leaning district in the city and previously ran, unsuccessfully, for the Texas House as a Republican.\n\n“I’m certainly looking at it,” Whyte said in a text message.\n\nState Rep. John Lujan, a Republican and former Bexar County sheriff’s deputy who represents a number of towns outside San Antonio, and Kristin Tips, a San Antonio funeral director who heads the Texas Funeral Service Commission, are also contemplating running, according to a source familiar with the district.\n\nAustin Republican Rep. Chip Roy’s announcement that he is running for attorney general also leaves a vacancy in his Central Texas-based 21st Congressional District, which includes parts of San Antonio and Bexar County. That seat could see enormous interest — Roy was one of 18 Republicans who ran in the 2018 primary, the last time the seat was open.\n\nThe Republicans contemplating a run in the 35th Congressional District may also be interested in the 21st District. Whyte said he is looking at both.\n\nThe redrawn 32nd Congressional District is the safest Republican seat that GOP map-drawers created. Currently a geographically compact district that contains about a third of the city of Dallas and some northern and eastern suburbs, the district was redrawn to become far more rural.\n\nUnder the new map, the 32nd District contains just 11% of the city of Dallas and extends east into six heavily Republican, majority-white counties, running nearly to Longview in East Texas.\n\nRep. Julie Johnson, D-Farmers Branch, was drawn out of the district. It went from voting for Harris by 24 percentage points to favoring Trump by 18 points.\n\nGiven how red the district is, the candidate that emerges could stand to spend decades in Congress, making it an attractive seat for ambitious Republicans.\n\nAlready, Ryan Binkley, a businessman and the founding pastor at Create Church in Richardson, has announced he is running. Binkley mounted a long-shot Republican presidential bid in 2023, competing in the first four states before dropping out and endorsing Trump. He spent millions of his own money in the process and never received more than 1,000 votes in any contest.\n\n“I believe we need leaders in Washington, D.C. with real-world experience who will fight for your freedom, fight for your prosperity and your family’s safety,” Binkley said in a launch video, calling himself a “strong, common-sense Texas voice.”\n\nOperatives are also eyeing state Rep. Katrina Pierson, a longtime tea party activist and communications consultant from Rockwall. Pierson was Trump’s national spokesperson in his first presidential campaign and a senior adviser on his 2020 bid. She went on to successfully defeat Republican then-state Rep. Justin Holland in a 2024 primary and is in her first term in the Legislature.\n\nPierson ran for Congress in 2014, losing a primary to Republican Rep. Pete Sessions. She contemplated running for an open Dallas-area seat in 2021 before ultimately deciding against it, saying at the time she was “not closing the door on Congress.”\n\nBut Pierson has not indicated if she is interested in running for the seat.\n\n“I need to get through the [legislative] session before even thinking about it,” she said in an interview Wednesday.\n\nMore all-star speakers confirmed for The Texas Tribune Festival, Nov. 13–15!

No, you’re not. Here’s why.","text":"Recession — and the fear of recession — is the one thing that could take a wrecking ball to people’s dreams of a middle-class life: steady employment, a vacation or two a year, college education, children in summer camp, and a home that is shiny and big enough to subtly showcase — tactfully and with #gratitude — on social media.\n\nThe Pew Research Center uses the middle 20% of Americans’ income and wealth (roughly $106,000) to define that massive club where everyone is hustling for membership. Others say it’s defined as making 50% above or below the median annual income (around $62,000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics and SoFI Learn).\n\nMany Americans regard a college education as a critical component to becoming middle class. But this alone may not be enough to make people middle class on paper: Outstanding student-loan balances in the U.S. now total around $1.8 trillion, more than any other type of household debt with the exception of mortgages.\n\nThe debate over whether the middle class has expanded or, in real terms, has shrunk, never seems to go away. \n\nWhich brings us to homeownership, that other essential marker for middle classdom. Only 66% of Americans, according to some estimates, actually own their own home. To qualify for a home mortgage, with the median price of $418,500, Americans would need to earn $117,000. You can’t be middle class to all people, all the time.\n\nThe ability of most Americans to seriously lay claim to the title has become so amorphous and, in many cases, unattainable, that the whole idea of middle class has become meaningless. The middle class is dead. Long live the middle class. Is it possible, given the high bar, that even six-figure households are proudly working class?\n\nIn a Wall Street Journal commentary titled “Free Trade Didn’t Kill the Middle Class,” Norbert Michel, director of the Cato Institute’s Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives, wrote, “The share of households earning more than $100,000 has tripled over the past five decades.” (And inflation has risen nearly 500% over the same period.)\n\nThe debate over whether the middle class has expanded or, in real terms, has shrunk, never seems to go away. Do baby boomers or Generation X-ers who started their careers 30 years ago, despite seeing their salaries increase over that time, feel any less worried about retirement or job loss or balancing the household budget?\n\nDon’t mess: Most American weddings are a lot more extravagant than the nuptials of Amazon’s Jeff Bezos\n\nMiddle class vs. working class\n\nIf we really are all middle class, what does that mean? This was probably the most eye-opening takeaway from this MarketWatch analysis, which laid out which of the five “wealth classes” you likely belong to based on your net worth, according to a category breakdown by Bo Hanson, a financial planner and co-host of the “Money Guy Show.”\n\nThe number of people who belong to the “middle class” have a net worth of $29,300 to $209,000 (bad luck if you only have a net worth of $29,200, as you only belong to the “bottom 10%”); the upper middle class have a net worth of $209,000 to $714,000; while the upper class have a net worth of up to $2.1 million. The “wealthiest 10%” are next.\n\nSome food for thought: Roughly 25 million households in the U.S. earn less than $30,000. For the sake of simplicity, let’s call them “working class” — to employ a British term that seems to be less popular in the U.S. — or blue collar, a more widely used term for lower-paid workers (who work just as hard, if not harder, than everyone else).\n\nAnother sign that the middle class has become harder to pin down: The share of U.S. adults living in middle-class households has fallen over the past five decades to 51% in 2023 from 61% in the early 1970s, according to the Pew Research Center, a 10 percentage-point decline over that period. Blame rising inequality.\n\nTrump’s speech to Congress did not mention ‘middle class.’ He mentioned ‘illegal aliens’ five times.\n\nYou know who have noticed this? President Donald Trump. Those figures are broadly, if crudely, reflected in Republican “red” states. Those red states reportedly have a lower median income than blue states and lower levels of education. Red states also have a higher mortality rate, according to this Newsweek analysis of World Population Review data.\n\nAmerican presidents used to appeal directly to the hopes, dreams, aspirations and fears of the middle class. State of the Union addresses often mentioned the middle class, primarily because presidents were aware that folks either wanted to be middle class or thought of themselves as middle class, even if they only had a couple of key qualifiers. \n\nThe middle class is not what it used to be, politically speaking at least. They/we used to be red meat for lawmakers. Trump’s speech to the joint session of Congress last March mentioned the middle class zero times. (He did, however, mention the Middle East four times; the only common denominator in that phrase is the word “middle.”) \n\nHe dropped the phrase “illegal aliens” five times. Trump, who is a billionaire several times over, did not mention “class” in the context of wealth and social advancement, during his speech. He spoke about the diversity, equity and inclusion contracts at the Department of Education, but not about the educational prospects of voters, per se.\n\nDon’t miss: A warning for all Americans — this is not a good time to put things on credit\n\nThe perils of economic mobility\n\nTrump has, to be fair, previously spoken about rescuing the middle class. One theory for such political-stump speeches: People want to better themselves, but it isn’t always as easy as it sounds. Relative economic mobility is lowest for kids who grew up in the Southeast and highest for those who grew up on the West Coast, Great Plains and Northeast. \n\nThe president focuses on “why” people may have not attained economic success. While others may disagree, it has been a lightning rod that propelled him to the White House. Former President Joe Biden’s focus on junk fees eating away at the middle class and Kamala Harris’s pleas to broaden the middle class did not resonate in the same way.\n\nThat suggests that the financial divide is a cultural one too. Case in point: More than a third of U.S. workers in technology, management, and business and finance occupations belong to the upper-income tier, according to Pew. If you want to find out if your neighbor is a high earner, they probably do if they work in tech.\n\nStill, it’s not all doom and gloom for social mobility and economic equality in America. “Notably, the increase in the share who are upper income was greater than the increase in the share who are lower income,” Pew Research found. “In that sense, these changes are also a sign of economic progress overall.”\n\nAre we doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past and keep spending until another downturn comes along?\n\n“But the middle class has fallen behind on two key counts. The growth in income for the middle class since 1970 has not kept pace with the growth in income for the upper-income tier,” the Washington, D.C.-based think tank added. “And the share of total U.S. household income held by the middle class has plunged.”\n\nAnd now what? If we’re all middle class or if none of us are really middle class, where does that leave nine-to-five clockwatchers? Are we doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past and keep spending and borrowing until another downturn comes along, and all our middle-class sand castles in the sky are blown away once again?\n\nMaybe this time is different. Middle-class Americans — everyone and no one, baby — could be finally learning their lesson after credit-card debt passed the $1 trillion mark in recent years. We are facing our fears and holding on tight to our dreams. Latest figures have actually shown a decline in credit-card debt for the third straight month. \n\nThe barometers of consumer behavior suggest we are not quite sure which way to turn. The savings rate hit 4.5% in June after soaring during the pandemic. Deloitte’s financial well-being index has been on a downward slide since December, and appears to show people have been cutting back on dining out, a favorite middle-class pastime. \n\nThe time has come to finally embrace our working-class roots.\n\nYou can email The Moneyist with any financial and ethical questions at qfottrell@marketwatch.com.

This time the man attacking my integrity, as well as that of my NewsBusters colleagues, was Pete Dominick, Stephen Colbert’s former warm-up act, on Sunday’s Sanity with Alisyn and Dave podcast.\n\nDave refers to Dave Briggs, who is now co-hosting this show with former CNN and Fox News colleague Alisyn Camerota. Briggs asked, “I do have one last question about Colbert and it’s, according to the stats, he hosted 176 left-leaning guests, one Republican since 2022, and I would guess a similar ratio with Fallon and Kimmel. Is that a mistake?”\n\nWhile we at NewsBusters appreciate Briggs confronting Dominick with our studies, it should be noted that the late night guest rolling count began in September 2022 as a way to see how the comedy shows were covering that year’s midterm election, and it has turned into a semi-annual exercise. As for Fallon and Kimmel, their ratios as of the end of June were 20.5-to-1 and 29-to-1, respectively. Still pretty bad, but not as horrific as Colbert’s 176-to-1. Readers anticipating January 2026’s installment can look forward to Fallon’s ratio falling with his recent hosting of Fox’s Greg Gutfeld.\n\nUnlike Jon Stewart, Dominick at least tried to come up with an argument for why I was wrong. The problem for him, though, was it was a half-baked strawman, “No, and it’s also a bullshit statistic. Where does that come from?”\n\nAfter Briggs informed him it came from NewsBusters, Dominick continued, “Yeah, it’s bullshit. Do you think that Colbert didn’t invite JD Vance and every single crazy right-winger on? They don’t come on with him because he’s too good at embarrassing them, and it makes no sense for someone.”\n\nBriggs followed up, “You know that? Do you know that they tried to book conservatives?”\n\nDominick exclaimed, “Of course! It’s a bullshit statistic. You think Stephen Colbert is afraid of booking, like, anyone? No. That guy would love — He booked Trump. He would have anyone on that would go on, and he would rip them, and he would get huge ratings.”\n\nFive things. First, I never claimed to do a study of invited guests because I am not privy to The Late Show’s internal deliberations; that would be impossible. Second, Colbert booked Trump back in 2015. As stated above, the study began in September 2022. Additionally, Colbert recently told PBS that he would not have Trump on as a guest nor “many politicians… that I think do not honestly represent what they actually believe, but are rather just playing to a crowd.” Third, if you listen to HBO’s Bill Maher, his problem is exactly the opposite: Republicans love to go on his show, while Democrats avoid him. Fourth, even if we assume Dominick is right, the study is about what the viewers see. If Dominick wants to challenge our opinion derived from the numbers, he can try, but he can’t call “bullshit” on the number itself.\n\nFifth, our critics may not believe us, but we are extremely generous to liberal media types in our studies. Most readers of this article would probably say former Rep. Liz Cheney is no longer a conservative, but she is counted as Colbert’s one Republican because she did sound like a traditional conservative when she challenged him on one point. Likewise, one of Kimmel’s conservative guests is Bill Burr, who is normally a pretty left-wing comedian, but he did manage to tell Kimmel something he didn’t want to hear about President Trump’s legal controversies.\n\nBriggs pushed back again, “I don’t know. I’d be really curious because I watched Colbert’s interview with Kamala Harris, and I thought it was, look, I think Stephen Colbert is brilliant. It was weak, at best. No questions about Biden’s mental decline right in front of Kamala Harris. No questions about really pressing her on how she blew an election by not answering tough questions and sitting down for interviews. I thought it could have been a really interesting and compelling interview.”\n\nDominick confessed to not watching the whole interview but claimed he knows what we here at NewsBusters really think, “I didn’t see the full thing, but I think that it’s a late night show, and they’re trying to be as entertaining as possible, but I would agree with that criticism. I think that you should generally hold everybody’s feet to the fire. And this idea that we’re not entertaining right-wing opinions or that academia’s got a liberal bias, you miss me with all that nonsense! It is way up on bullshit mountain, including that statistic you just cited from that bizarrely discredited news organization NewsBusters, which is so right-wing and conspiratorial, I’m pretty sure they were birthers back in the day.”\n\nThe late night shows are simply not entertaining right-wing opinions. Meanwhile, we here at NewsBusters are not and never have been birthers. We are media analysts; we are not conspiracy theorists. If Dominick wants to challenge our studies, instead of calling us names, he should do his own and prove us wrong.\n\nHere is a transcript for the August 17 show:\n\nSanity with Alisyn and Dave\n\nDAVE BRIGGS: I do have one last question about Colbert and it’s, according to the stats, he hosted 176 left-leaning guests, one Republican since 2022, and I would guess a similar ratio with Fallon and Kimmel. Is that a mistake?\n\nPETE DOMINICK: No, and it’s also a bullshit statistic. Where does that come from?\n\nBRIGGS: This comes from NewsBusters.\n\nDOMINICK: Yeah, it’s bullshit. Do you think that Colbert didn’t invite JD Vance and every single crazy right-winger on? They don’t come on with him because he’s too good at embarrassing them, and it makes no sense for someone.\n\nBRIGGS: You know that? Do you know that they tried to book conservatives?\n\nDOMINICK: Of course! It’s a bullshit statistic. You think Stephen Colbert is afraid of booking, like, anyone? No. That guy would love — He booked Trump. He would have anyone on that would go on, and he would rip them, and he would get huge ratings.\n\nBRIGGS: I don’t know. I’d be really curious because I watched Colbert’s interview with Kamala Harris, and I thought it was, look, I think Stephen Colbert is brilliant. It was weak, at best. No questions about Biden’s mental decline right in front of Kamala Harris. No questions about really pressing her on how she blew an election by not answering tough questions and sitting down for interviews. I thought it could have been a really interesting and compelling interview.\n\nDOMINICK: See, I didn’t see the full thing, but I think that it’s a late night show, and they’re trying to be as entertaining as possible, but I would agree with that criticism. I think that you should generally hold everybody’s feet to the fire. And this idea that we’re not entertaining right-wing opinions or that academia’s got a liberal bias, you miss me with all that nonsense!

This time the man attacking my integrity, as well as that of my NewsBusters colleagues, was Pete Dominick, Stephen Colbert’s former warm-up act, on Sunday’s Sanity with Alisyn and Dave podcast.\n\nDave refers to Dave Briggs, who is now co-hosting this show with former CNN and Fox News colleague Alisyn Camerota. Briggs asked, “I do have one last question about Colbert and it’s, according to the stats, he hosted 176 left-leaning guests, one Republican since 2022, and I would guess a similar ratio with Fallon and Kimmel. Is that a mistake?”\n\nWhile we at NewsBusters appreciate Briggs confronting Dominick with our studies, it should be noted that the late night guest rolling count began in September 2022 as a way to see how the comedy shows were covering that year’s midterm election, and it has turned into a semi-annual exercise.

Newsom and Pritzker are considered avowed progressive Democrats. Beshear and Shapiro are considered centrists, mostly due to their states’ political makeup. Kentucky has a Republican-led legislature, while Pennsylvania has the nation’s only split legislature, with the GOP controlling the Senate and Democrats the House.\n\nBut a deeper dive into their records shows none of the governors is a fiscal hawk.\n\nWhile Kentucky has enacted tax cuts under Beshear’s watch, some of those cuts happened despite the governor. Beshear initially vetoed HB 8 in 2022, arguing it jeopardized targeted corporate incentives — though critics said he was protecting special interests at the expense of broader tax relief. “[He] prioritized handouts to selected corporations over simpler tax-rate cuts to encourage all businesses to invest,” Chris Edwards wrote in the Cato Institute’s “Fiscal Policy Report Card on America’s Governors 2024.” Beshear approved more tax cuts last year, but there was speculation that the GOP’s veto-proof majority in the state legislature was a factor. \n\nBeshear received a “D” in the fiscal report card.\n\nThe Bluegrass State also experienced an explosion of government spending during Beshear’s tenure. Kentucky has seen its budget rise from $11.4 billion in fiscal 2021 to $16.9 billion in fiscal 2026, according to the Urban Institute. It could have been much higher. Beshear’s original proposal was for the “largest budget that we’ve seen in history,” at $136.6 billion. \n\nShapiro, who has cultivated a reputation as a centrist, has an uneven record as well.\n\nShapiro, a finalist to be then-Vice President Kamala Harris’s running mate last year, has presided over significant spending growth in Pennsylvania. The state budget rose from $40.8 billion in 2023 to $44.6 billion in 2024 — up from $36.6 billion in 2019. The state’s Independent Fiscal Office has warned that the current $6.6 billion general fund surplus could be exhausted by 2025.\n\nShapiro received a “D” in Cato’s fiscal report card.\n\nOne thing dragging down Shapiro in the Keystone State is the budget timeline. The state government has failed to pass a budget on time during Shapiro’s governorship. While it’s easy to blame legislative gridlock — the GOP controls the Senate and Democrats control the House — critics have said Shapiro’s role cannot be ignored.\n\n“He was absent from budget negotiations,” the Commonwealth Foundation wrote on July 1. “Instead of taking an active role in these conversations, he spent his time promoting himself on social media.”\n\nShapiro’s defenders argue he’s doing the best he can under divided government. Longtime Pennsylvania Democratic strategist TJ Rooney told the Washington Examiner that the governor is a known consensus builder, even if it takes longer than people hope.\n\n“I sincerely do believe he has a chance to restore [fiscal] sanity [in Washington, D.C.],” Rooney said. “It’s not just wishful thinking or projection — he’s built a brand around it.”\n\nOther governors took their spending to even higher levels.\n\nDuring Newsom’s tenure as California governor, the state saw its general fund spending rise by 65%. The government responded to a $58 billion deficit last year by raising corporate taxes, reducing spending levels, and pulling money out of the Rainy Day Fund. California can no longer rely on federal COVID-19 funds to fix budget holes. The Urban Institute said the state government has spent all $41-plus billion.\n\nIt’s no wonder California has seen a population exodus, losing 239,575 residents between 2023 and 2024, according to the Census Bureau. Newsom’s poll numbers sit at a 46% disapproval rate, according to the Berkeley IGS poll. That’s slightly better than his 49% disapproval rate from 2023. \n\nNewsom received a “D” from CATO for fiscal policy.\n\nHis progressive colleague in Illinois, Pritzker, has slightly better ratings — but not from a financial standpoint.\n\nThe billionaire governor has taxed and spent Illinois since becoming governor in 2019. The state has seen its budget rise from $36.1 billion in fiscal 2020 to $53.1 billion this year. \n\nTo pay for the spending, Pritzker pushed for billions of dollars in new taxes, including changing the state’s flat tax to a multirate tax. (Voters rejected the plans.) And while he increased the cigarette tax by $1 in 2019, he raised nicotine pouch taxes even further to 45%.\n\nIllinois has seen more and more people leave to avoid those high taxes. The IRS ranked Illinois second on the list of states seeing the most population loss due to taxes, behind New York.\n\nPritzker received a “C” from Cato for fiscal policy in 2024, after getting an “F” the year before.\n\nDespite the poor fiscal policy scores for the governors, Edwards expressed confidence that a governor would be better than someone already ensconced in Washington.\n\nHe cited the need for state governments to balance their annual budgets as a powerful requirement. “It’s a lot harder for state politicians to screw future generations with debt than [the] federal government,” Edwards told the Washington Examiner.\n\nIf politicians follow the strict limits, the budget and debt will be kept under control, he observed.\n\nThere are still several non-governors running at the top of the Democratic ticket. \n\nRep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) seems willing to take on his party. The five-term congressman wants Democrats to focus on the economy, technology, due process, and civil liberties. Khanna regularly visits other states, saying it’s important to listen to what voters want.\n\nHe’s no centrist. Khanna advocates a Marshall Plan for America, a tax on the wealthy, and Medicare for all. His rhetoric occasionally imitates Trump when talking about China and the World Trade Organization. When Khanna discusses economic patriotism, he mentions the importance of government involvement in directing industry. Khanna was a key supporter of the CHIPS and Science Act, a bill the Congressional Budget Office estimated would add $79 billion to the deficit through 2031.\n\nRahm Emanuel, a former Chicago mayor and former President Barack Obama’s chief of staff, has appeared on multiple podcasts and TV shows this year. He tangled with hosts on whether the Democratic Party was too focused on transgender issues in 2024, instead of crime and education.\n\nEmanuel isn’t anyone’s example of a good fiscal steward. He regularly increased Chicago’s budget while in the mayor’s office, and he hiked taxes to pay for increased pension benefits. This included a 29.5% surcharge on water and sewer bills for the municipal employee pension fund.\n\nThat makes 2028 an interesting battle within the Democratic Party. Although likely candidates are attempting to put themselves in different fiscal lanes, the reality is that the most fiscally sane candidate could be Obama’s chief of staff. That leaves fiscal hawks in a strange position.\n\nThe big question remains whether voters believe the nation’s fiscal standpoint should be the most important issue when they cast a ballot.\n\nPolls regularly show the public is concerned about the national debt. Gallup polls dating back to 2011 have found that at least 73% of those surveyed were worried about federal spending. This included 81% this past March. Pew Research found that 57% of Americans want the federal government to reduce the budget deficit.\n\nBut when it comes to the election, voters have regularly sent candidates who rack up more and more debt to Washington.\n\n“If one were really serious about it, you would have to touch entitlements, you’d have to touch defense spending, and you’d have to raise taxes,” said Dan Turrentine, a Democratic strategist and co-host of The Morning Meeting on 2WAY. “Democrats have historically not wanted to touch entitlements, and Republicans haven’t wanted to raise taxes.”That time may be coming sooner rather than later, particularly with the CBO projecting Social Security and Medicare will run out of money in 2033. That means a regular congressional bailout or benefit cuts.\n\nJason Pye, a senior policy adviser at the Independent Center, told the Washington Examiner that a wake-up call is coming, whether people like it or not.\n\n“There has to be a conversation with voters about how we have to modernize trust fund programs that are fiscally unsustainable,” he said. “And how they’re going to accomplish that goal by reaching across the aisle.”\n\nIf no one in Washington is willing to lead on the debt, the next presidential election may be just another chapter in the nation’s fiscal denial.\n\nTaylor Millard is a freelance journalist who lives in Virginia.","summary":"As Democratic politicians prepare their shadow campaigns for the 2028 presidential nomination, voters face a disturbing prospect: a lack of solutions for America’s out-of-control debt.

Trump must do 3 things next","text":"The White House made headlines this week by finally joining TikTok. As someone who has been urging Republican leadership to modernize our outreach to young people for years, I believe this is a long-overdue step in the right direction. But joining TikTok isn’t enough on its own. To win over the next generation of voters, this White House must go further — and faster. President Trump’s political comeback in 2024 wasn’t a fluke. It was built on connecting with youth voters in ways no Republican had ever tried before. When he tapped me to come on as chair of the RNC’s inaugural Youth Advisory Council in 2023, I told party leaders bluntly that the days of relying on a Sunday newspaper ad to deliver the GOP’s message were over. My generation doesn’t read the classifieds — we scroll feeds. We share memes. We stream podcasts. We are digital natives, and any party serious about winning our support has to meet us where we are. That’s exactly what President Trump did. He embraced new platforms, leaned into long-form podcasts, and even launched a TikTok account that quickly became the fastest-growing account in the platform’s history. The results spoke for themselves. Nationally, 46% of Gen Z backed Trump in 2024, a 10-point surge from 2020. In Wisconsin, Republican support among 18-to-29-year-olds jumped from 36% in 2020 to 48% in 2024. That is a generational shift in motion. WHITE HOUSE LAUNCHES OFFICIAL TIKTOK ACCOUNT WITH TRUMP FEATURED PROMINENTLY IN DEBUT VIDEO But the work is far from over. The GOP holds the House at 218 seats — a razor-thin margin — and the results showed clear divides among young voters. Young men trended right while young women leaned left, especially on issues like abortion. The takeaway is obvious: Republicans can’t take their foot off the gas when it comes to modern youth outreach. And here’s the truth: if Republicans don’t stay in the game, others will. My peers are not only watching President Trump — they’re also listening to progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. and even far-left figures like democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani, who could soon be mayor of New York City. Many in Gen Z are flirting with socialism because those voices are showing up online and on campus in ways conservatives too often don’t. If the White House and the GOP want to cement Gen Z gains, they need to get in the game now — not two years from now. Here are three ways the White House can seize this moment: 1. Launch a White House Podcast — The Modern Fireside Chat One of the biggest turning points in 2023 came when Trump started appearing on popular podcasts. These weren’t 7-minute cable news hits clipped for social media. They were long, unfiltered, authentic conversations lasting up to three hours. And they reached tens — sometimes hundreds — of millions of people, many of them first-time voters. I MADE MEMES FOR THE WHITE HOUSE. HERE’S WHAT I LEARNED Young Americans are drowning in student debt, struggling to afford eggs, and working two jobs. They’re not paying for cable bundles. They’re streaming on YouTube and Spotify. That’s why podcasts were so effective — because they met people where they already were. Now that he’s back in the Oval Office, President Trump should take it further by hosting a monthly White House podcast. Thirty minutes, once a month. It would be the modern equivalent of FDR’s fireside chats: a direct, unfiltered line from the president to the people. That kind of accessibility would deepen his connection with young voters and bypass the hostile filter of legacy media. 2. Take a Campus Speaking Tour This May, just before he walked on stage to deliver the commencement address at the University of Alabama, I had the opportunity to meet with President Trump one-on-one. I told him directly: my peers don’t just want to see their president online — they want to see him on campus. TRUMP TELLS UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA GRADUATES NOT TO BE A 'VICTIM,' SAYS IN AMERICA 'WE REJECT THAT IDEA' The impact of a campus speaking tour would be enormous. Universities are the beating heart of Gen Z political culture. Too often, conservatives have ceded that ground to the Left. But when Trump goes into these spaces — whether it’s a stadium filled with graduates in Alabama or a rally near a college town — students show up. And they listen. The Kamala Harris campaign’s approach to keeping their monopoly on Gen Z last November was a political consultant's fever dream: using trendy phrases like \"joy\" in messaging, posting TikTok trends, and bringing our A-List celebrities. Up until that point, they executed the perfect made-in-a-lab playbook to win over my peers, but there was just one problem: she screamed at us instead of talking to us. There’s a difference between standing on stage next to Beyoncé and thinking that’s all you have to do to win over America’s youngest voters, and actually taking the time to fly to college campuses and throw out hot dogs in the student section like President Trump did in Tuscaloosa last October. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Remember when the world was shocked when Trump descended on the Bronx for a rally in a territory Republicans never talked about much less visited? That same feeling of excitement--of an unseen community being seen--could happen again if the president held a speech on Harvard’s campus. Imagine a presidential speaking tour that takes him to major universities across the country, not just red states but swing states where young voters could decide the balance of power in 2026. Hearing directly from the president of the United States, not filtered through CNN or MSNBC, would cut through the noise and give students a chance to engage with conservative ideas firsthand. 3. Keep the TikTok Account Active Trump’s TikTok account broke records as the fastest-growing in the platform’s history. That momentum cannot go to waste now that the campaign is over. TikTok is where millions of young Americans spend their time, and the White House should treat it as a permanent tool for outreach, not just a campaign gimmick. Behind-the-scenes videos, short policy explainers, and even lighter content showing the human side of the presidency would reach audiences that traditional news outlets will never touch. TikTok’s algorithm thrives on authenticity, and the White House has the chance to use it as a window into The People’s House — not just a political stage. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP President Trump’s youth outreach strategy helped rewrite the rules of American politics. It showed Republicans that Gen Z isn’t a lost cause. In fact, we are trending conservative faster than any recent generation. But winning our support takes effort. It takes consistency. And it takes meeting us where we live — online and on campus. Joining TikTok is a good move, but it must be the beginning, not the end. A monthly White House podcast, a presidential campus tour and a daily energetic presence on TikTok would send a clear message: this president isn’t just talking at young people — he’s talking with us. That’s how you prevent Gen Z from drifting toward AOC or Zohran Mamdani and instead lock in a generation for the conservative movement.

His party found itself embroiled in an identity crisis after Donald Trump grew his vote total among 18–29-year-old voters by 11 points.For a party long identified with championing causes of the future, the shift was a smack in the face. However, coming from a place of relative success, Parker, 23, was optimistic about emerging leadership's ability to prevent this shift from becoming a trend.Georgia was the only state where Democrats outperformed Biden's 2020 total with young voters, gaining by 7 percent with voters under 30, according to NPR. Parker helped lead that effort as president of the Young Democrats of Georgia from January through September of 2024 before taking the role of national committee representative that he holds today.Prior to visiting Parker in his hometown of Dunwoody, Georgia, as part of a larger reporting project on Gen Z politics, I'd encountered him in August 2024 at the Democratic National Convention confronting Republicans who came to exert their presence.That took place less than a month after Parker became a popular figure on TikTok and Instagram—boasting roughly 205,000 and 60,000 followers on the respective platforms—after he went viral for rapping the lyrics to Kendrick Lamar's grammy-winning single \"Not Like Us\" at a Harris campaign rally.\"When life gives you lemons, you make lemonade,\" Parker told me over coffee. Having started his foray into Democratic politics knocking on doors at 15, then founding a Democratic Party chapter at his high school, then working to elect a Democratic mayor to Dunwoody, then volunteering for Jon Ossoff's Senate campaign, then serving as a 2020 DNC delegate, Parker never intended to become a social media influencer.The viral moment has no doubt offered Parker a platform to share nuanced political content and connect with peers across the country. However, he still believes the key to political change starts at the local and community level, emphasizing that through bottom-up organizing, Democrats can win again by starting small and riding that momentum up. His evidence: the top-down approach executed by the party last cycle proved disastrous and alienated young Democrats in the process.A Changing Democratic VoterThe rise of social media and fall of prime-time television have vastly changed political campaigning. While candidates could once reach tens of millions of voters during prime time, today's audiences are fractured and skeptical of interacting with mailers and phone calls. Strategy matters more than ever because, as Trump proved, elections can be won despite raising far less money.Democrats raised more than $1 billion more than Republicans—according to a New York Times analysis of Federal Election Commission data. A breakdown of that data by the nonprofit OpenSecrets found 70 percent—roughly $1.6 billion—of the Harris campaign's spending went toward media, with her top five recipients all being media consultant and production firms based in Washington, D.C.The Trump campaign also had media as its top expenditure at 67 percent of its spending—nearly $314 million—but his campaign hired firms based in New York, Florida, and Virginia, with his fifth highest expenditure being private jet services.Gen Z Republican politicos attribute the Trump campaign's diversified outreach strategy to his unexpected success with voters under 29. Brilyn Hollyhand, chair of the Republican National Committee's Youth Advisory Council, said his council aided Republicans in reaching new segments of youth voters by bringing together elected officials, young and college Republicans, corporate leaders, and national figures to execute new outreach strategies.Emanuel Hernaiz, treasurer of the Georgia and Atlanta Young Republican chapters as well as the former state director of Latinos for Trump, said the GOP benefits greatly from its relationship with conservative activist Charlie Kirk's Turning Point USA. Through its local chapters and relationships with influencers, Turning Point proved a powerful force in bolstering Republican grassroots outreach and helping the party respond quickly to trending issues online.Young Republicans and Democrats I spoke to agreed that the left does not have a comparable grassroots outreach arm to Turning Point, and leaders, including Parker, offered criticism toward the DNC's concentration of power and resources in Washington, D.C.The imbalance of power between Washington Democrats and their state peers became a key feature of the 2025 race for DNC chair, with Ken Martin, who previously led Minnesota's state Democratic Party, winning the nomination on the promise of returning power to the states. For Democrats in red America, this mandate warranted cause for optimism.Fighting From WithinKimberly Agyekum, a 29-year-old native of central Ohio, serves as the president of the Ohio Young Democrats. Her unconventional entry into politics began at an Ohio wine bar where she met the mother of Democratic congressional candidate Danny O'Connor, who talked her into working for his campaign.Despite O'Connor losing his bid—although he now serves as Franklin County Recorder—Agyekum said it was \"the best summer of my life\" and has been hooked on politics ever since. In April 2024, she became the first Black woman to lead the Ohio Young Democrats and has played a key role in national campaigns. It's in the latter position where she noticed issues with her party's strategy.Agyekum believes Ohio is emblematic of a missed political opportunity for the Democratic Party. Ohio voted for the winning presidential candidate every election since 1964 until it backed Trump over Biden in 2020.Still, despite being represented by Republicans in all the major statewide offices, the state feels winnable for Democrats. In 2023, a ballot measure passed in Ohio affirming abortion access. The state ranks among the 20 most unionized, and it has three significant Democratic-leaning metropolitan areas in Columbus, Cleveland, and Cincinnati. Given this, Agyekum doesn't see culture war issues as the reason for Democratic losses but instead blames the party's top-down organizing strategy.In contrast to the Democrats' grassroots approach to defending abortion access in Ohio, the 2024 election was an example of what state party leaders described to me as The National Consultant Treatment.\"They come in and don't really invest in the infrastructure of what we can do here at the state and local level and instead just want to do their thing,\" Agyekum said. While she believes the state party needs national funds to compete, Agyekum said state and local party leaders better understand how to spend those dollars. For example, when national Democrats decided to fund a mural in Columbus promoting Harris, the mural was installed in an area with low foot and vehicle traffic, she said.The 2024 Ohio Senate race was a prime example of this as former four-term Democratic incumbent Senator Sherrod Brown defended his seat against Bernie Moreno, a wealthy car dealer.Brown's campaign featured criticism of his own party. Yet, despite his rallying against the establishment, the party apparatus inserted itself heavily in the race as individuals came in across the country and started instructing local leaders and volunteers on how to run things, Agyekum said.In the process, they demonstrated knowledge gaps and drew resistance from locals. \"Anybody who has 'organizing' in their title, whether it be the top person or all the way down to organizing interns, those people should be from here,\" Agyekum said. \"When we're talking about people lower on the totem pole of a campaign, it becomes more and more important that that person works in the state where they're from.\"A Pattern of Unforced ErrorsThe chair of the Democratic National Committee Youth Council agrees with Agyekum's analysis of the problem. André Treiber, a 33-year-old Texan, has worked in politics since Barack Obama's presidency and believes it's not the party's platform that has soured with voters, but its way of connecting with them.\"What activists, elected officials, and party officers see and face in their communities every day is completely different from what a consultant is going to talk about at their happy hour,\" André told me.André said services from the national party are sometimes only received from its preferred vendors. André has carried out organizing work for campaigns in Texas and experienced national consultants coming in and presenting campaign strategies derived from national polling and focus groups that he said feel out of touch with the area's concerns.Other times, André said, Democratic-aligned PACs fundraise off a heated race without a clear intention of putting that money back into the campaign. Sometimes they also spread political materials that actively work against the campaign, because of being out of touch with local issues.Understanding the landscape and culture of an area doesn't just help ensure messaging lands, but it also helps prevent money being misspent. Irshad Rembert, a 20-year-old Georgia State University political science student, has experienced the unforced errors and wasted dollars associated with poor top-down organizing.After completing an internship with Georgia General Assembly for Democratic Representative Tanya Miller, Irshad was inspired to recharter the Georgia State Young Democrats chapter in Spring of 2024 and has grown its membership to 130, he said.When it came time for Democrats to campaign in the state later that summer, the party had a new organization at the state's most heavily enrolled school, which has a student population of over 50,000. Come election season, the Democratic Party of Georgia expressed interest in holding an event on campus. But when the time came, Irshad said the party communicated very little with the chapter and arranged to hold the event in a known hub for unhoused individuals.The event was supposed to give free food to college students, but instead it went to the unhoused people, he said. As the election drew nearer, interactions with party higher-ups proved similar. \"Whatever the request was, however small it was, it was like pulling teeth,\" he said.Georgia State's appointed campus organizer promised signs and T-shirts, but come October 25, was unable to provide them. When Irshad asked why, the organizer said the state party, which coordinated with the national party, was unresponsive.By contrast, when Kirk and Turning Point came to campus, they brought a robust array of volunteers, posted numerous signs, and gave away free MAGA hats. At a Georgia Democratic Party campus event, they charged for Harris-Walz hats. \"Turning Point is about 10 members that I know of, if that, so for them to get that level of support campus, was really shocking to me.\"Organizing ForwardAll the young Democrats I spoke to remain committed to their party's platform and do not think it needs to take any major changes to stave off accusations of being too \"woke.\" Rather, they believe their current principles—like supporting abortion rights, LGBTQ+ equality, and racial justice—should be treated as settled priorities, thus state and local leaders will not need to relitigate these topics and can instead focus on the matters most pertinent to their communities.Parker believes doing this effectively requires D.C. policymakers to seed agenda-setting power to their colleagues back home. By listening to those on the ground, he thinks the party can better expand its appeal.\"If you're out there in the community, they're gonna humble you, and you can't be elitist,\" he said. \"Folks really need to focus on being out in their community or candidates will get out of touch and that's what I think is like an issue with some folks in D.C.\"In Georgia, Parker is encouraging young people interested in politics to begin their careers by pursing roles in local and state office. So far, this effort has found success. \"The Henry County party is led by a 25-year-old. The Macon-Bibb County party is led by a 25-year-old. The vice chair of Gwinnett County is led by a 20-year-old,\" he told me.The Harvard Public Opinion Project Youth Poll's Spring 2025 data reports that just 19 percent of Americans under 30 trust the federal government  to do the right thing most or all the time, with further distrust being held toward an array of other national institutions.The internet no doubt changed the way America conducts politics, and with historic economic inequality and political unrest, many individuals only trust the people and institutions they interact with face to face. For most, that's not Washington—it's the state and their community.While a strong federal government may be central to the Democratic Party's identity, maintaining that objective likely requires relinquishing control from the capital and encouraging state politicos to explore new ways to achieve success.The organizers who win elections have grown tired of D.C. calling the shots, and the young Democrats of Georgia believe the success they've garnered demonstrates that bottom-up campaigning can expand appeal in places like Ohio.The question for party leaders is will they let the next generation of organizers test this belief come 2026 and 2028.Editor's Note: This story was written under advisement of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, where the author conducted this reporting in completion of his Master of Arts thesis.","summary":"As Republicans make Gen Z gains, young Democrats call for the party to reassess its strategy and messaging ahead of future elections.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/gen-z-democrats-warn-dnc-2111943","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2702284/georgia-young-democrats-leader-parker-short.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=e1728303e75208c020489ea5ae0c6812","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-22 09:00:01","author":"Alex J.

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk\nBy CAROLINE PEACOCK, SHOWBUSINESS REPORTER and RICHARD EDEN, DIARY EDITOR \n Published:08:46 BST, 22 August 2025 |Updated:08:55 BST, 22 August 2025 \n\nEllen DeGeneres and her wife Portia de Rossi fled the US even before the old sheriff - otherwise known as Donald Trump - rode back into town. \nBut now, horse-loving Ally McBeal star is back in the saddle, 'living her dream'.\nThe couple recently moved from the Cotswolds farmhouse they snapped up for £15million last year to a single-storey, 11,000 sq ft courtyard home nearby.\nIt has what Ellen called ‘a horse facility’ because, she said: ‘Portia couldn’t live without her horses’. \nTaking to Instagram on Thursday, the ex-chat show host, 67, shared a sweet snap of her wife horse riding in the English countryside. \nPortia, 52, appeared completely in her element as she beamed for the camera while on her trusty steed.\n\nEllen DeGeneres and her wife Portia de Rossi(pictured) fled the US even before the old sheriff - otherwise known as Donald Trump - rode back into town\n\nThe couple recently moved from the Cotswolds farmhouse they snapped up for £15million last year to a single-storey, 11,000 sq ft courtyard home nearby (pictured in 2016)\n\nTaking to Instagram on Thursday, the ex chat show host, 67, shared a sweet snap of her wife horse riding in the English countryside\nAlongside the post, Ellen penned: 'Portia’s living her dream riding her horse through the English countryside and into the village.\n'Gosh I hope she comes home soon.'\nIt comes after Ellen and Portia celebrated their 17th wedding anniversary earlier this week.\nThe comedian marked the occasion by posting a sweet video from their wedding day to Instagram.\nIn the clip, Ellen and Portia are at first seen in casual clothing as they survey the preparations at their home.\nPink flowers are brought in and the crystal is placed on tables with name cards and silverware for dozens of guests.\nThe caption was brief: 'Happy 17th anniversary of the best day of my life. Portia, I love you more everyday. #MarriageForAll.'\nShe then tagged fashion designer Zac Posen and singer-songwriter Joshua Radin.\n\nIt comes after Ellen and Portia celebrated their 17th wedding anniversary earlier this week\nThis comes after news that the power couple are selling their home in the UK just a year after they bought it because they needed more space.\n\nEXCLUSIVE Residents sayEllen DeGeneres and wife Portia are already eyeing up new property after flooding \nThe pair moved to Britain in 2024 and snapped up a 43-acre estate in the Cotswolds for £20 million, but they have now put the property on the market for £22.5 million because they needed to move to a bigger house to accommodate Portia's horses which they have flown over from the US.\nEllen explained the decision in a statement given to the Wall Street Journal via realtors Sotheby's: 'When we decided to live here full time, we knew that Portia couldn't live without her horses.\n'We needed a home that had a horse facility and pastures for them.'\nEllen and Portia said goodbye to the US and moved to the UK 'for good' earlier this year, which she has confirmed was in response to the election of President Donald Trump.\nAsked this year if she was staying in the UK because of Trump, she replied: 'Yes. We were hopeful for [Democratic presidential nominee] Kamala [Harris]. We were very hopeful and we thought at least let's get a place here.'\n\nEllen and Portia said goodbye to the US and moved to the UK 'for good' earlier this year, which she has confirmed was in response to the election of President Donald Trump (pictured)\n\nShe and Portia opted to settle in the Cotswolds, a popular spot for wealthy Londoners to keep second homes.\n'The idea was that we would be here for three or four months of the year — but always when we came here we loved it and we thought it was beautiful,' Ellen shared.\n'We thought when I stopped the show [Ellen's eponymous US talk show] one day, that it was so beautiful here that we would get a farm here and then go back there.\n'And we got here the day before the election. We woke up to lots of texts from our friends and crying emojis. And we were like, \"He [Trump] got in. So we are staying here. We are not going back. We are not leaving.\"'\nEllen DeGeneresDonald TrumpInstagram\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nEllen DeGeneres shares sweet clip of wife Portia de Rossi 'living her dream' in the English countryside after the pair fled the US because of Trump\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

Gavin Newsom.\n\nMoreover, as Newsom continues leading the fight against Trump and GOP-led redistricting, there are signs that Democrats across the country may soon rally around the California Governor.\n\nAccording to a new Politico-Citrin Center-Possibility Lab survey, which sampled California Democrats, Newsom leads Harris by 6-points (25% to 19%) in preferences for Democrats’ 2028 presidential nominee.\n\nIn that same vein, Emerson polling from early August found very similar results. In that poll – also conducted among California voters – Newsom (23%) led the Democratic field, with Buttigieg (17%) and Harris (11%) behind him.\n\nFurther, political betting site Polymarket shows Newsom (28%) with the best odds to be Democrats’ 2028 nominee, 14-points ahead of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and 23-points ahead of Harris.\n\nTo be sure, while 2028 is a considerable time away, these polls are not outliers.\n\nRather, they reinforce a point I made in these pages nearly two months ago: the political prospects for Newsom and Harris are sharply diverging.\n\nIndeed, immediately after the 2024 election, Harris dominated 2028 polling.\n\nAt the time, polls, including this one from Puck News/Echelon Insights in November 2024 showed Harris holding a 33-point lead over the 2nd place Newsom (41% to 8%).\n\nSimilarly, an Emerson survey – also taken last November – reported that Harris led Newsom by a virtually identical 30-points (37% to 7%).\n\nBehind Newsom’s improving political fortunes appears to be the increasingly front and center role he’s taken in fighting back against Trump and Republicans.\n\nNowhere is this more evident than in the ongoing saga over redistricting, an issue Newsom is using to raise his profile among Democratic voters, and which he is increasingly staking his 2028 hopes on.\n\nTo that end, as the redistricting issue garners more attention and with California lawmakers set to pass the measure to put it on the ballot, the risks for Newsom raise in tandem.\n\nShould California voters pass the ballot referendum this fall, polls suggest that it will be a boom for Newsom’s chances in the Democratic primary.\n\nOne recent survey from UC Berkeley-Citrin Center shows that nearly two-thirds (63%) of national Democrats support California redistricting as a response to Texas’ efforts.\n\nFurther, former President Barack Obama has joined Newsom’s supporters, saying that California’s response to Texas is a “reasonable approach.”\n\nInterestingly – and likely why Newsom is pushing so hard for redistricting – national Democrats are considerably more supportive of drawing new districts than those in California.\n\nAs I cited last week, more than 6-in-10 (61%) of California Democrats prefer the current system of an independent redistricting commission, versus just 39% who want politicians to redraw the maps.\n\nIn other words, with national Democrats overwhelmingly supportive of partisan redistricting, Newsom is hoping that he will garner their support if he successfully pushes the ballot measure through – and he very well may.\n\nWith all of this being said, there is a significant downside should California voters reject the Governor’s push, a very real possibility.\n\nThe aforementioned California poll revealed that 64% of all California voters opposed partisan redistricting, while 36% supported giving lawmakers the power to redraw maps.\n\nJoining the nearly two-thirds of Californians in opposition to Newsom’s efforts is former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. And while Schwarzenegger’s campaign is non-partisan – he even endorsed Harris in 2024 – California Republicans have joined in.\n\nAccording to Politico reporting, former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said he’s planning to raise more than $100 million to fund an opposition campaign, along with $30 million already promised by Charles Munger Jr. – the son of Warren Buffett’s late partner.\n\nWhether or not the opposition is enough to overcome many Californian’s desire to push back against Trump and the GOP remains to be seen.\n\nBut it is clear that Newsom’s success is not a foregone conclusion.\n\nWith that in mind, should California voters reject the ballot measure, the defeat would be a tremendous blow for Newsom’s 2028 hopes.\n\nNot only would the governor have failed to land an actual hit on Trump – something no Democrats or Republicans have truly been able to do thus far – but national Democrats may feel Newsom is ineffective.\n\nFinally, it must be remembered that there are also risks for Newsom even if he is successful.\n\nAn overtly partisan move like this, while potentially beneficial in a Democratic primary could very well backfire in a general election, especially if Independents take a dim view of such moves.\n\nUltimately, in what figures to be a crowded Democratic field in 2028, Gavin Newsom is clearly seeking to raise his profile by capitalizing on an issue that would endear him to national Democrats – even if it means risking a potentially humiliating defeat.\n\nWhether or not he succeeds is yet to be determined, but right now, there is little doubt that it has worked to elevate Newsom above Kamala Harris and other candidates.\n\nDouglas Schoen is a longtime Democratic political consultant.","summary":"Whether or not he succeeds is yet to be determined, but right now, there is little doubt that it has worked to elevate Newsom above Kamala Harris and other candidates.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/08/22/douglas-schoen-redistricting-raises-newsoms-profile-but-risks-remain/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/SUT-Z-CALIF-REDISTRICTING-02.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-22 07:33:46","author":"Douglas Schoen","authors":["Douglas Schoen"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.298},{"id":353161510,"title":"On This Day, Aug. 22: IRA founder Michael Collins assassinated","text":"Aug. 22 (UPI) -- On this date in history:\n\nIn 1851, the U.S.-built schooner America outran a fleet of Britain's finest ships around England's Isle of Wight in an international race that became known as the America's Cup.\n\nIn 1881, American humanitarians Clara Barton and Adolphus Solomons founded the National Red Cross.\n\nIn 1922, Michael Collins, a founder of the Irish Republican Army and a key figure in Ireland's independence movement, was assassinated by political opponents.\n\nIn 1968, Pope Paul VI arrived in Colombia, becoming the first pontiff to visit South America.\n\nIn 1986, Kerr-McGee Corp. agreed to pay the estate of nuclear industry worker Karen Silkwood more than $1 million, ending a 10-year legal battle waged by her family over her exposure to radioactive materials at the company's Oklahoma plant.\n\nIn 2004, two masked robbers stole Edvard Munch's The Scream and another painting from the Munch Museum in Oslo, Norway.

At NewsBusters, we said “CBS Escorts Fumbling Biden.” The “RNC Research” account on Twitter highlighted this strange exchange:\n\nPelley: \"What is your message to Hezbollah and its backer, Iran?\"\n\nBiden: \"Don't. Don't don't don't -- \"\n\nPelley: \"Don't...come across the border, don’t escalate this war?\"\n\nBiden: \"That's right.\"\n\nWhen CBS News refused to release the unedited footage of their Kamala Harris interview, Trump sued. They could release the 2023 Biden video and transcript. Former CBS News investigative reporter Catherine Herridge, who was fired for apparently being too independent and bipartisan for CBS, told the New York Post: “If there’s no problem, making the material public would reinforce the 60 Minutes position that their editing meets the highest standards.” She added if the program refuses, that says a lot. “My training is that with major newsmakers, the full transcript should always be released.”\n\nAfter Biden’s cognitive failure was revealed at his debate with Trump last summer, networks released full video and transcripts of every Biden interview that came afterward so they would not be accused of hiding anything. But CBS wasn’t going to retroactively show how they pampered Biden in 2023. \n\nOther CBS staffers who witnessed the interview told The Times that Redstone’s concerns were “overblown.” On air, Pelley made the excuse that Biden seemed “tired.” But no one should trust their version of events if they refuse to release the proof.\n\nPelley didn’t have tough questions for Biden. He had nothing on any Biden scandals. He was more concerned with trashing the Republicans as dangerous, asking Biden: “Hard-right Republicans are obstructing the election of a Speaker of the House. Does the dysfunction that we've seen in Congress increase the danger in the world?”\n\nPelley closed that softball segment by underlining how Biden toured the Dachau death camp in Germany with his granddaughter and gee, he sure loves Israel – not that his foreign policy showed it.\n\nIn 2022, Pelley did the same thing, asking Biden sugary gushers like this one: “You have lived a long life of triumph and tragedy. In November, you'll be 80. And I wonder what it is that keeps you in the arena.” We know part of the answer: He was kept in the arena by protective journalists like Pelley.\n\nThis has been the pattern for decades at CBS. Dan Rather and the rest threw the kitchen sink at Republicans. But CBS was so proud of its puffball interviews with Barack Obama that they made a DVD for Democrats to enjoy. They deserve a chorus of boos as they arrogantly praise themselves for their “unwavering integrity.”","summary":"New York Times reporter James Stewart wrote a big article based on a series of interviews with CBS owner Shari Redstone, and buried deep in the piece was something wild that should have been obvious: CBS settled Donald Trump’s lawsuit to keep the public from seeing how they make “news” sausage.\n\n Stewart said Redstone “worried that Mr. Trump’s lawyers could cherry-pick raw footage and internal communications and do more damage to CBS News’s reputation than any settlement would.” She wanted their sale of CBS and Paramount to Skydance Media to get federal approval, and the lawsuit complicated everything. \n\nRedstone told The Times that CBS employees warned her that in October 2023, when Scott Pelley of 60 Minutes interviewed President Biden, he had seemed “drowsy and had to be prodded to answer.” She worried that CBS might be accused of “editing the interview to conceal Mr. Biden’s failings.”\n\nConservatives made the accusation in real time with what actually aired.

As the cameras rolled, he offered a stark message about crime, an issue he's been hammering for decades, as he thanked them for their efforts.\"We're not playing games,\" he said. \"We're going to make it safe. And we're going to then go on to other places.\" The Republican president is proudly promoting the work of roughly 2,000 National Guard troops in the city, loaned by allied governors from at least six Republican-led states. They're in place to confront what Trump describes as an out-of-control crime wave in the Democratic-run city, though violent crime in Washington, like dozens of cities led by Democrats, has been down significantly since a pandemic high.Trump and his allies are confident that his stunning decision to dispatch troops to a major American city is a big political winner almost certain to remind voters of why they elected him last fall.Democrats say this is a fight they're eager to have.Live EventsMaryland Gov Wes Moore, an Army veteran, cast Trump's move as a dangerous political stunt designed to distract the American people from his inability to address persistent inflation, rising energy prices and major health insurance cuts, among other major policy challenges.\"I'm deeply offended, as someone who's actually worn the uniform, that he would use the lives of these men and women and the activation of these men and women as political pawns,\" Moore told The Associated Press.Trump's extraordinary federal power grab comes as the term-limited president has threatened to send troops to other American cities led by Democrats, even as voters voice increasing concern about his authoritarian tendencies. And it could be a factor for both sides in elections in Virginia and New Jersey this fall - and next year's more consequential midterms. Inside the White House strategy The president and White House see Trump's decision to take over the DC police department as a political boon and have been eager to publicize the efforts.The White House offered a livestream of Trump's Thursday evening appearance, and on Wednesday, Vice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth made a surprise visit to Union Station, DC's busy transit hub, to thank members of the National Guard over Shake Shack burgers.Each morning, Trump's press office distributes statistics outlining the previous night's law enforcement actions, including total arrests and how many of those people are in the country illegally.The strategy echoes Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration, which has often forced Democrats to come to the defence of people living in the country illegally, including some who have committed serious crimes.A White House official, speaking on background to discuss internal deliberations, dismissed concerns about perceptions of federal overreach in Washington, saying public safety is a fundamental requirement and a priority for residents.Trump defended his efforts during an interview on \"The Todd Starnes Show\" Thursday.\"Because I sent in people to stop crime, they said, He's a dictator.' The real people, though, even Democrats, are calling me and saying, It's unbelievable' how much it has helped,\" he said.The White House hopes to use its actions in DC as a test case to inspire changes in other cities, though Trump has legal power to intervene in Washington that he doesn't have elsewhere because the city is under partial federal control.\"Everyday Americans who support commonsense policies would deem the removal of more than 600 dangerous criminals from the streets of our nation's capital a huge success,\" said White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers. \"The Democrats continue to be wildly unpopular because they oppose efforts to stop violent crime and protect law-abiding citizens.\" Democrats lean in Moore, Maryland's Democratic governor, suggested a dark motivation behind Trump's approach, which is focused almost exclusively on cities with large minority populations led by Democratic mayors of color.\"Once again, we are seeing how these incredibly dangerous and biased tropes are being used about these communities by someone who is not willing to step foot in them, but is willing to stand in the Oval Office and defend them,\" Moore said.Even before Trump called the National Guard to Washington, Democratic mayors across the country have been touting their success in reducing violent crime.Cleveland Mayor Justin Bibb, who leads the Democratic Mayors Association, noted that over half of the 70 largest Democratic-led cities in the country have seen violent crime decrease so far this year.\"He's stoking racial division and stoking fear and chaos,\" Bibb said. \"We need someone who wants to be a collaborator, not a dictator.\" Democratic strategists acknowledge that Trump's GOP has enjoyed a significant advantage in recent years on the issues of crime and immigration - issues Trump has long sought to connect. But as Democratic officials push back against the federal takeover in Washington, party strategists are offering cautious optimism that Trump's tactics will backfire.\"This is an opportunity for the party to go on offense on an issue that has plagued us for a long time,\" said veteran Democratic strategist Daniel Wessel. \"The facts are on our side.\" A closer look at the numbers FBI statistics released this month show murder and nonnegligent manslaughter in the US in 2024 fell nearly 15 per cent from a year earlier, continuing a decline that's been seen since a coronavirus pandemic-era crime spike.Meanwhile, recent public polling shows that Republicans have enjoyed an advantage over Democrats on the issue of crime.A CNN/SSRS poll conducted in May found that about 4 in 10 U.S. adults said the Republican Party's views were closer to their own on crime and policing, while 3 in 10 said they were more aligned with Democrats' views. About 3 in 10 said neither party reflected their opinions. Other polls conducted in the past few years found a similar gap.Trump also had a significant edge over Democrat Kamala Harris on the issue in the 2024 election. About half of voters said Trump was better able to handle crime.At the same time, Americans have expressed more concern about the scope of presidential power since Trump took office for a second time in January.An AP-NORC poll conducted in April found that about half of US adults said the president has \"too much\" power in the way the US government operates these days, up from 32 per cent in March 2024.The unusual military presence in a US city, which featured checkpoints across Washington staffed in some cases by masked federal agents, injected a sense of fear and chaos into daily life for some people in the nation's capital.At least one day care centre was closed Thursday as childcare staff feared the military action, which has featured a surge in immigration enforcement, while local officials raised concerns about next week's public school openings.Moore said he would block any push by Trump to send the National Guard into Baltimore.\"I have not seen anything or any conditions on the ground that I think would justify the mobilization of our National Guard,\" he said. \"They think they're winning the political argument. I don't give a s-- about the political argument.\"(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News ontrumptrump washinton dc takeoverus national guarddemocratsrepublicans\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)
