Delivering his usual rhetoric and bigotry — from accusing Harris of being a communist to calling her a liar (“she gets up and just lies”) and claiming she’s “flooding our country with millions and millions of low wage migrants” whom he baselessly claims are mostly prisoners, mental institution patients, and terrorists — Trump also whined about having had to spend money to battle Biden, but now his strategy has been messed up with a new candidate. “I spend $100 million,” he claimed on what he has forked out for his initial run against President Joe Biden. “Now, I have to run against somebody else. Is that fair? I think they should reimburse me for the 100 million. Who wants to collect?” In the days following Biden leaving the race to Harris becoming the presumptive nominee, Trump struggled to combat his new foe, falling back to primarily attacking Biden. During Saturday’s rally, he still called Biden “crooked,” but he also went off teleprompter to claim that Biden “hates [Harris]. This was an overthrow of a president,” he claimed. As for his attacks on Harris, he played a video, which included snippets from when she previously ran for president. He criticized her laugh. “Have you heard her laugh? That is the laugh of a crazy person… It’s a laugh of a lunatic. Have you heard her?,” he said, then he claimed: “You know, they prohibited her. They prohibited her for laughing. I’ve been waiting for the laugh, because as soon as she laughs, the election’s over.” Trump also took umbrage with Harris’ looks. He brought up her cover with Time Magazine, and pointed out that it was a drawing. He said he thought it was Sophia Loren in the depiction, and that someone else had told him Harris had the advantage of being a “very beautiful woman,” which drew boos and sneers from the audience. So he said he want back to look at the story, and wildly concluded: “I say that I am much better looking than her… I’m a better looking person than Kamala.” Beyond his direct attacks on Harris, he also claimed that the “country is going to die” should he not be reelected. It was his seventh visit to the battleground state, and his second in Pennsylvania since he was shot and wounded in Butler. A poll published yesterday by Emerson College/RealClearPennsylvania has him leading with Pennsylvania voters by a slim margin of one percentage point, whereas a week ago, a poll from The New York Times and Siena found that he was trailing Harris by four percentage points among Pennsylvania voters (red state polls are also worrying the GOP). Trump and Harris will also face-off in the state during their first debate on Sept. 10 in Philadelphia.","summary":"Former president continues to complain a month later about facing a new candidate leading into the Democratic National Convention","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-rally-biden-harris-time-magazine-pennsylvania-dnc-1235082447/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DonaldTrump2-1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-18 00:30:18","author":"Althea Legaspi","authors":["Althea Legaspi"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.344},{"id":254345718,"title":"Trump remarks on economy laced with personal insults at Pennsylvania rally","text":"Former President Donald Trump on Saturday repeatedly swerved from a message focused on the economy into non-sequiturs and personal attacks, including declaring several times that he was better looking than Vice President Kamala Harris.Trump wound back and forth between hitting his points on economic policy and delivering a smattering of insults and impressions of President Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron as he held a rally in northeastern Pennsylvania.The former president has seemed to struggle to adjust to his new opponent after Democrats replaced their nominee.

CNN anchor Michael Smerconish showed a Fox News poll showing a 22-point gender gap — men favor Trump by 12 percentage points, and women prefer Vice President Kamala Harris by 10 — during a segment on the network Saturday. “The problem is that Kamala Harris reminds men of their first wife and Donald Trump reminds women of their first husband’s divorce lawyer, and it’s actually kind of true,” Luntz said. “I know it’s funny, but it’s kind of true.” Luntz went further, saying he believes “there are actually going to be divorces” because of the unprecedented nature of what he called a gender “chasm.” He also offered three pieces of advice for Trump on the campaign trail with about 2 1/2 months until Election Day. “First, don’t insult your opponent for how they look, how they speak,” Luntz said. “Women can’t stand that.” Later in the day, at a rally in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, Trump rejected a suggestion he said he received that Harris has an advantage in the race because “she’s a very beautiful woman.” “I say that I am much better-looking than her, I think I’m much better, much better,” Trump said. “I’m a better-looking person than Kamala.” Luntz also alluded to Trump’s tendency to dwell on his 2020 election defeat, which he often encourages supporters to avoid a repeat of by voting in numbers that make it “too big to rig.” “Second, they expect you to focus on the future, not on anger about the past, and that’s, again, the exact opposite of what Trump is actually doing,” Luntz said. “Third, particularly now, we’ve had arguably eight years of this rough-and-tumble kind of politics,” Luntz said. “The economy has been challenging, inflation has clearly made lives more difficult for so many people, and you want to lean into that. You acknowledge it, you show people a solution, you give them ideas for how they can change it.” At a Friday event in Raleigh, North Carolina, Harris outlined a plan to lower costs for households over the next four years in her first policy-focused speech since she became the Democratic nominee. ​​“That’s exactly what Harris did yesterday,” Luntz said. “You may disagree with what she’s saying, but at least she’s addressing it.” Smerconish also showed New York Times/Siena College polling data indicating the gender gap is more pronounced in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, three states that have served as bellwethers over the past four cycles. The margin grew to 32 points in the so-called “blue wall” states, with women favoring Harris by 17 points and a 15-point lead among men for Trump. “No one’s seeing the campaign except for those three states and four others,” Luntz said, highlighting the importance of the dollars being spent on advertising in rallies in swing states. The same poll, released Aug. 10, showed Harris leading Pennsylvania and Wisconsin overall by 3 and 4 percentage points, respectively, while Trump led Michigan by 3 points.","summary":"Republican pollster and communications strategist Frank Luntz weighed in on the gender divide among voters in the presidential race, arguing that former President Donald Trump is “actively going out of his way” to widen it.

That's the view of liberal activist and filmmaker Michael Moore who has warned Democrats not to fumble their chances of beating former President Trump in November’s presidential election now that Vice President Kamala Harris heads the ticket. The outspoken and influential Moore told the Guardian that the party is riding on a wave of optimism following President Biden’s decision to bow out of the race after succumbing to unwavering pressure from powerful left-wing voices, including Moore. \"This isn’t just a sugar-high or what [recovering] heroin addicts call a pink cloud,\" Moore told the U.K. publication. \"It was so depressing for so many weeks and then it was instantly not depressing. I am hopeful now but it’s ours to blow – and we have a history of blowing it.\" MICHAEL MOORE WARNS KAMALA HARRIS TO NOT GO ‘CENTRIST’ Moore has been here before. He warned Democrats of Trump beating Hillary Clinton in his 2016 movie \"in Trumpland\" where he said Trump’s message appealed to disenfranchised voters in Michigan and other battleground states. In 2020, he took to X and said that enthusiasm for Trump was \"off the charts\" and pleaded with Democrats to come together to defeat the incumbent. Moore says he’s happy Harris chose Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate and that he’s confident Harris can inflict serious damage on Trump when they debate next month. \"Once anybody gets under that thin skin anything can happen,\" Moore says. \"On live TV? Trump could explode, start talking like a 12-year-old, though no offense to 12-year-olds, or get up and leave.\" ‘I understand why people are nervous it might be a sugar high but Harris and Walz are people of substance.

After causing catastrophic inflation, Comrade Kamala announced that she wants to institute socialist price controls.” With food prices surging more than 20% nationwide during the Biden-Harris administration, Harris, during a North Carolina rally on Friday, unveiled economic policies she’d enact during her first 100 days as president. They include having the Federal Trade Commission enforce a federal ban on price gouging that would slap hefty penalties on companies that set exorbitantly high prices. “What they are doing is a communist takeover of our country,” Trump said of the Harris proposal. “Her plan is very dangerous because it may sound good politically … This is Communist; this is Marxist; this is fascist.” The ex-president also took a few minutes to offer the left-wing Washington Post rare praise for publishing a scathing editorial ripping Harris for claiming price gouging is causing inflation and, rather than offer a legit plan to fix it, offering only “populist gimmicks.” Trump’s appearance was his seventh this year in the key battleground state where recent polls show a stalemate between him and Harris for Pennsylvania’s 19 electoral votes up for grabs.","summary":"Donald Trump on Saturday on Saturday ripped Vice President Kamala Harris' plan to slap socialist price controls on groceries, saying she’s gone “full Communist.”","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/17/us-news/trump-kamala-harris-price-control-plan-is-full-communist/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/87917771.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/eWNI4j6M-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-17 23:57:56","author":"Rich Calder","authors":["Rich Calder"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.003},{"id":254344808,"title":"Free abortions, vasectomies will be available to DNC attendees in Chicago","text":"Attendees at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago will have the opportunity to get a free abortion or vasectomy just blocks away from the event — and vasectomy appointments are filling up fast. Planned Parenthood Great Rivers, which serves most of Missouri and part of southern Illinois, is sending a mobile health center to the Windy City’s West Loop to offer the reproductive services on Monday and Tuesday. Medication abortions are reportedly available on both days, with vasectomies being exclusively offered Monday, according to The New York Times. Vasectomies are reportedly in high demand and there’s already a waiting list. “There are going to be people traveling to Chicago from all over the country,” Dr. Colleen McNicholas, the chief medical officer of Planned Parenthood Great Rivers told the paper. “And I think we should be doing what we can as health care providers to show what the impact of good policy and bad policy is.” The services will be provided “on a sliding-fee scale — pay what you can and get the health care you need,” according to the appointment reservation form, which only requires a name, date of birth and basic contact information. Vice President Kamala Harris, who will be nominated as the Democratic presidential nominee at the convention, has been outspoken in her support for abortion rights after the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, which had federally protected abortion access for half a century. Abortion has become one of the integral parts of Harris’ campaign after several states passed their own strict abortion bans since the Supreme Court’s decision in 2022. Harris has called abortion one of America’s “fundamental freedoms,” according to a White House release announcing her “Fight for Reproductive Freedoms” in December. Unlike previous years, abortion is expecting to be a front and center issue for Democrats at the convention, according to The Times. “There’s a direct through line between what Donald Trump did and loss of access to abortion care,” said Senator Tina Smith, Democrat of Minnesota, who previously worked for Planned Parenthood. “That’s one of the reasons why people are seeing this in a kind of completely different frame than they were even just four years ago.” In addition to the mobile clinic, another group, Americans for Contraception, plans to erect an 18-foot-tall inflatable intrauterine device, or IUD, named “Freeda Womb,” The Times reported. Other activists are planning a “Hotties for Harris” party, in addition to a number of other events. Meanwhile, businesses in downtown Chicago have started boarding up their doors and windows in anticipation of thousands of anti-Israeli protesters that have planned to take over the city streets during the convention.","summary":"Attendees at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago will have the opportunity to get a free abortion or vasectomy just blocks away from the event &#8212; and vasectomy appointments are filling up fast.

While Trump appeared set to cruise in many purple states against Joe Biden, polling has shown Harris gaining ground in some states and leading in others. However, her chances of claiming all seven of the toughest contests – considered by experts to be Georgia, Arizona, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, North Carolina and Nevada – are quite low. British oddsmakers William Hill give Harris just a 50-to-1 odds of sweeping those states, essentially a two percent chance. Biden notoriously flipped Georgia, Arizona, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan from red to blue to win in 2020, while hanging on to Nevada and losing North Carolina to beat Trump. Harris holds decent to better than a coinflip odds on winning all of these states on their own. The current vice president has a 69.2 percent shot of flipping North Carolina, 66.7 percent in Michigan, 61.9 percent in Wisconsin and 60 percent in both Georgia and Pennsylvania. With those seven states in play, if Harris and Trump both equaled their results in the remaining races, it would leave Harris with an electoral vote lead of 226 to 219, with 270 votes needed to win. Aside from Nevada and its six electoral votes, if Harris won any four of the remaining six swing states indicated, she would have the numbers to claim victory. Based on the new figures, Harris has erased the lead Trump was building in the states before President Biden dropped out of the race. However, in a DailyMail.com poll published earlier this week, the former president still holds a two-point lead over the new Democratic nominee. Where other recent polls show the vice president surging ahead, our survey of 1001 likely voters found that 43 percent would vote for Trump if the election were tomorrow, compared with 41 percent who would vote for Harris. With a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percent it sets the stage for a nail-biter of an election in November. A separate online survey teased out the attributes responsible for Trump’s lead. It found that voters still see him as the stronger, more charismatic candidate, who is more likely to get things done. Even so, Harris scores better than Biden across the board. And it all suggests that she is shaping up to be a more formidable opponent than the 81-year-old she replaced. Harris was catapulted into the race after Biden announced last month that he was giving up his reelection campaign. Trump insiders were initially jubilant, expecting weeks of Democratic infighting. But the party quickly rallied around the vice president and will show a united front at its convention in Chicago next week. The result has been a series of polls showing that Harris has overturned, or at least reined in, Trump’s clear poll lead. The first presidential debate between the two is set to be held in Philadelphia on September 10 and will be moderated by ABC News. The first vice presidential debate between Democratic Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota and Republican Sen. JD Vance of Ohio will take place on October 1 in New York City, and will be hosted by CBS.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe odds of Kamala Harris hitting a lucky seven and winning all&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Kamala&#8217;s odds of winning all seven swing states uncovered &#8211; unexpected outcomes favor one candidate first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/kamalas-odds-of-winning-all-seven-swing-states-uncovered-unexpected-outcomes-favor-one-candidate/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/08/17/23/88634963-13753803-image-a-9_1723934909033.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-17 23:49:13","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.156},{"id":254344580,"title":"Mayor Todd Gloria Heading to Nevada to Campaign for Kamala Harris","text":"San Diego Mayor Todd Gloria will travel to Nevada today as part of the Kamala Harris for President campaign’s “Weekend of Action” to kick off the Democratic National Convention, according to the mayor’s office.

Trump also owns 114,750,000 shares of Trump Media and Technology Group.

The former president argued, “Nobody knows how to say her first name. Is it ‘Day-na’ or ‘Dah-na’? Nobody knows. It’s been going on for 20 years; she’s been around a long time. Is it ‘Day-na’ or ‘Dah-na’? And now the fake news will say, ‘Trump didn’t know how to pronounce her first name.’ She doesn’t know how to pronounce it.” Trump also extended an olive branch to Bash’s CNN colleague, Jake Tapper. The pair hosted the first presidential debate between Trump and President Joe Biden. “But look, but Dana and Jake, I used to call him ‘Fake Tapper,’” Trump said. “Now I call him Jake Tapper because he treated us very fairly and so did Dana — treat me very fairly. I think it was, you know, just about neutral.” As he played media critic, Trump also went back to his continued attacks on ABC anchor George Stephanopoulos, who he referred to as “George Slopadopoulos.” “The worst network to me is ABC. Worse than NBC, worse than CBS, worse than CNN — the home of George Slopadopoulos, a nasty guy.” He went on to make fun of the journalist’s height and mock his questions as being too easy for Biden, despite the president’s interview being seen as part of Biden’s ongoing poor appearances that led to him stepping down as the Democratic Party’s candidate. Elsewhere, Trump praised the invention of TiVo and waxed nostalgic for its glory days. “I love the playback controls you have nowadays. They used to call it ‘TiVo,’ now they TiVo— I think it’s the single greatest invention. It is better than television,” he told attendees. Trump’s Pennsylvania event was also discussed on social media by self-described “political junkie” Peter Henlein, who tweeted, “Trump’s rally today: ‘I’m better looking than Kamala. no one knows how to pronounce Dana Bash’s name. Tariffs good. It should be illegal to criticize the Supreme Court. TiVo is awesome. I won Minnesota twice.’ This is dumb. Stop pretending it isn’t.” Trump received fewer votes than rivals Hillary Clinton and Biden in both 2016 and 2020. Despite pleading from fellow Republicans to focus on policy, Trump has continued to levy personal attacks against Vice President Kamala Harris. While speaking to reporters from his New Jersey golf club earlier this week, Trump insisted, “I think I’m entitled to personal attacks. I don’t have a lot of respect for her” and added, “They want me to be nice. But they’re not being nice to me. They want to put me in prison.” Trump also took issue with Jewish Democrats at the Saturday rally. He told the crowd, “Any Jewish person that votes for her or a Democrat has to go out and have their head examined. Because if you see what’s happening with Israel and Jewish people right now, there has never been a more dangerous time since the Holocaust if you happen to be Jewish in America.” This isn’t the first time Trump has attempted to shame Jews in the United States who plan to vote for the Democratic candidate. Back in May, he said, “What Biden is doing with respect to Israel is disgraceful. If any Jewish person voted for Joe Biden, they should be ashamed of themselves.” The commentary prompted a retort from “Daily Show” host Jon Stewart, who said, “My apologies to you, Rabbi. Thank you so much for taking time off of your condomless porn star hush money trial to deliver a shame lecture to Jews. I will reflect on your moral standing next Yom Kippur.” You can watch Donald Trump’s full Saturday rally from Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania below","summary":"The GOP's presidential candidate also laments the heyday of TiVo and says he's better looking than Kamala Harris\n\n\nThe post Donald Trump Explains Why He Stopped Calling Jake Tapper ‘Fake,’ Argues Dana Bash Can’t Pronounce Her Own Name | Video appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/donald-trump-dana-bash-jake-fake-tapper/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/trump-apprentice-book.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-17 23:36:17","author":"Stephanie Kaloi","authors":["Stephanie Kaloi"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.01},{"id":254344238,"title":"New Poll Reveals Significant Change in Race Between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris in Four Crucial Swing States in the Sunbelt","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris has now closed the gap between her and former president Donald Trump across four key swing states. New findings by The New York Times suggest that the two presidential hopefuls are now in tight races across Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina. Trump had seemed set to run away with these states just a few weeks ago, but new polling shows Harris is gradually erasing his lead. He remains ahead in Georgia 50 percent to her 46, and in Nevada it is 48 percent for him while 47 for Harris. Harris has claimed 49 percent of voters to Trump’s 47 in North Carolina, one of the core battleground states he carried in 2020. The polls do continue to show some risk for Harris – including that 49 percent of voters see her as too liberal, while 33 percent of voters see Trump as too conservative. Democratic voters meanwhile are now excited by Harris being the nominee, with 85 percent saying they are enthusiastic about voting for her. This roughly matches voters’ level of enthusiasm for Trump Harris, who would be the first Black woman to serve as president, has the support of 84 percent of Black voters, according to the polls. That is higher than President Biden’s support than when he dramatically dropped out of the race just a few weeks ago. Meanwhile her backing among Latino voters sits at 54 percent, and has taken a 14 percent point lead over Trump among women in Arizona, Georgia and Nevada. Harris now leads nonwhite voters in those three states by 29 points, while Biden had led those voters in the same states by 17 points in May of this year. Trump meanwhile is maximizing his support among white voters without a college degree, taking 66 percent of support from them across the Sun Belt states. Harris also holds a 13 point advantage over Trump among TikTok users in Arizona, Georgia and Nevada, indicating her online traction with younger voters. Voters gave both candidates a 48 percent favorable rating. In one survey in February voters had viewed Harris more unfavorably. Despite the positives, Trump holds the advantage among voters on what are bound to be two issues integral to the race to the White House, the economy and immigration. Voters ranked those as the most important facing the nation, but the two are closely tied on the question of who would handle those issues better. Trump is still favored on the economy, the polls found, but has dropped considerably since Biden dropped out of the race. Harris meanwhile had widened the Democratic edge over Trump on the topic of abortion. Trump is more trusted by voters when dealing with immigration, leading Harris 53 percent to her 43. When third party candidates were included, the state of the race in the states was unchanged, with Robert F. Kennedy taking just 4 percent of likely voters. A significant amount of voters viewed Trump as being a stronger leader and believed that he would shake things up. When asked ‘who cares about people like me’, Harris had a slight advantage over Trump, 52 percent to 48 percent. Alina Szmant, 78, a Democrat and retired scientist in Wilmington, North Carolina, told the Times she was excited about the possibility of voting for the first female president. She said: ‘Kamala is extremely well prepared to be an excellent president. As for Mr. Biden? She would have voted for him mostly because of her disgust for Mr. Trump. ‘[Biden] was not my first choice. He wasn’t even my second or third or fourth choice.’ While Sergio Villavicencio, a Marine veteran who lives in Arizona, told the Times he voted for Trump in 2016 and then Biden in 2020. The 40-year-old now plans to support Harris because she seems more concerned about his issues. He said: ‘If that person’s supposed to be representing all of us, and he’s picking and choosing who’s he’s representing, billionaires and Elon Musk and all these kinds of corporations. ‘He’s not speaking for the people. [Trump is] not talking to the people. He doesn’t give a damn about the people.’ Just last week, the Times published polling showing how Harris had moved ahead of Trump by four points in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Among likely voters in each state, 50 percent said they would likely vote for Harris while 46 for Trump. Based on the new figures, Harris has erased the lead Trump was building in the states before President Biden dropped out of the race. The first presidential debate between the two is set to be held in Philadelphia on September 10 and will be moderated by ABC News. The first vice presidential debate between Democratic Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota and Republican Sen. JD Vance of Ohio will take place on October 1 in New York City, and will be hosted by CBS.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has now closed the gap between her and&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: New Poll Reveals Significant Change in Race Between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris in Four Crucial Swing States in the Sunbelt first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/new-poll-reveals-significant-change-in-race-between-donald-trump-and-kamala-harris-in-four-crucial-swing-states-in-the-sunbelt/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rewrite-this-title-Shock-new-poll-shows-dramatic-shift-in.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-17 23:27:55","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.105},{"id":254344310,"title":"Walz makes pitch to Republican, Libertarian voters during Nebraska rally","text":"Minnesota Gov.

Former President Obama won the 2nd Congressional District in 2008, splitting the state's vote for the first time since 1964 after strategically targeting it, and President Biden won its sole electoral vote in 2020.

The poll, published Saturday, from The New York Times/Siena College found Harris is leading Trump in Arizona (50 percent to 45 percent) and North Carolina (49 percent to 47 percent). The vice president’s momentum has in recent weeks led her campaign to declare that the Tar Heel Sate, where Trump had built a solid lead when facing former President Biden, is back in play for Democrats. In Nevada and Georgia, Harris has largely closed the gap with the former president. Trump leads the vice president in the Silver State, 48 percent to 47 percent, and in the Peach State, 50 percent to 46 percent, per the survey. As an average of the four Sun Belt states, Trump and Harris are tied at 48 percent, the survey shows. Either candidate needs to win at least one of these states alongside three Rust Belt states — Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania — to clinch the presidency. Harris has steadily gained in national polls since Biden announced last month he would withdraw from the race and endorsed her to run in November. She became the official Democratic nominee earlier this month, and will formally accept the nomination alongside her running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz next week at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. A separate survey from The Times/Siena earlier this month found Harris leading Trump by at least four points in the Rust Belt states. Before Biden withdrew his candidacy, the former president was leading him by 3 percent in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. An August 10 poll from the New York Times/Siena found that Harris leads Trump by four points in those three Rust Belt states. Earlier in the year, Trump led Biden by three percent in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, three must-win states for Democrats to hold the White House. Saturday’s poll is a significant improvement for Democrats compared to a similar survey conducted in May, in which Trump led Biden by 50 percent to 41 percent in Arizona, Georgia and Nevada. That poll did not include North Carolina. The latest poll results also come after the independent election handicapper Cook Political Report shifted Arizona, Georgia and Nevada from “lean Republican” to “toss-up,” as Harris continues to chip away at Trump’s lead in most battleground states. Democrats are also far more excited about the presidential race with Harris at the top of the ticket compared to Biden, with 85 percent saying they are at least somewhat excited for their candidate and the election, which is also far higher than the May poll. Roughly 85 percent of Republicans are also at least somewhat excited to vote, which is close to the same as May. Voters overall gave Harris a 48 percent favorable rating, the same as her unfavorable rating. No prior Times/Siena poll had tested her favorability in these states, but national surveys had found that Kamala had as much as a 19-percent net unfavorable rating in February. Since launching her campaign, Harris has quickly built momentum, especially online, with posts on platforms like TikTok, which have reengaged young voters dispirited by a Biden candidacy. That boost was evident in Saturday’s poll, with Harris holding a 13-point lead against Trump among TikTok users in Arizona, Georgia and Nevada. Biden had a three-point lead with the same group in May. The poll also showed that the people’s votes are increasingly split among racial and gender lines. Harris garnered the support of 84 percent of Black voters and 54 percent of Latino voters in the recent survey. Overall, she leads Trump with nonwhite voters in Arizona, Georgia, and Nevada by 29 points, compared to Biden’s 17-point lead in May. On the flip side, Trump had the support of 66 percent of white voters without a college degree in the four Sun Belt states. Third-party presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr’s support has halved since the May poll, and he brought in only 4 percent as an average across the four states, per the poll. His candidacy no longer meaningfully affects the contest between Trump and Harris in these states, a trend mirrored across other swing states since the vice president rose to the top of the ticket. The Hill/Decision Desk HQ’s national polling index shows Trump leading Harris nationally by 1.8 percentage points — 49 percent to 47.2 percent — based on more than 100 surveys. The latest Times/Siena surveyed 2,670 registered voters across the four states from Aug. 8-15. The margin of error for the polls out of Arizona, Nevada and Georgia is 4.4 percentage points, and the margin of error in North Carolina is 4.2 percentage points.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nA recent survey shows that Vice President Harris is narrowing the margin&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Survey shows Harris and Trump in close race in 4 key swing states first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/survey-shows-harris-and-trump-in-close-race-in-4-key-swing-states/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Harris-Trump-neck-and-neck-in-4-critical-swing-states.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-17 23:26:23","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.214},{"id":254344044,"title":"Donald Trump Mocked for Saying He's 'Better Looking' Than Kamala Harris","text":"In a turn of events that has become increasingly common in the 2024 presidential race, former President Donald Trump has once again ignited controversy with his latest remarks about Vice President Kamala Harris.During a campaign rally in Wilkes-Barre Pennsylvania on Saturday, Trump veered off-script to make an unexpected claim about his appearance compared to that of the Democratic nominee for president.\"I say that I am much better looking. I'm a better looking person than Kamala,\" Trump declared to the crowd, responding to a critique he had read from a Republican commentator.According to Trump, the commentator suggested that one of Harris' greatest assets in this election was her attractiveness. \"She said, Kamala has one big advantage, that she's a very beautiful woman,\" Trump recounted, before dismissing the notion with his own assessment of their relative appearances.Newsweek contacted Trump's campaign on Saturday via email for comment.Online commentators took to social media to mock Trump for not sticking to policy and making fun of Harris during the key swing state rally.This latest comment is part of a growing pattern of personal attacks Trump has leveled against Harris since she entered the 2024 race despite being warned by GOP analysts to stick to policy over attacks.The former president has taken to describing her as a \"radical liberal\" and has crafted a variety of unflattering nicknames, including \"Kamabla,\" \"Lyin' Kamala,\" and \"Laffin Kamala.\"Far from backing down from these personal jabs, Trump has doubled down on his approach. In a news conference at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, the former president defended his right to attack Harris personally.\"I think I am entitled to personal attacks,\" Trump stated bluntly. \"I don't have a lot of respect for [Harris]. I don't have a lot of respect for her intelligence, and I think she'll be a terrible president.\"Trump attempted to justify his stance by accusing Harris of weaponizing the justice system against him and others. He also claimed that Harris had called him \"weird,\" though fact-checkers were quick to point out that it was actually her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, who first began describing Republican policies as \"weird\" in late July.The former president's comments have raised eyebrows and concerns across the political spectrum. Trump's penchant for personal attacks has extended beyond mere nicknames and insults about intelligence.During an interview at the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) conference in July, Trump questioned Harris's racial identity, stating that she had only recently \"became a Black person.\" This comment drew particular criticism, given that Harris is the daughter of a Jamaican father and Indian mother, and is the first Black, Asian American, and woman to hold the office of vice president.Republican pollster Frank Luntz has warned that such comments could further damage Trump's already precarious standing with women voters. Luntz described the gender gap between Harris and Trump as a \"chasm,\" citing recent polling data that shows a significant disparity in support between male and female voters.\"Trump is actively going out of his way and insulting his way... and it's not a [gender] gap, it's a chasm. We've never seen this before,\" Luntz said in an interview with CNN. He went on to explain that Trump's personal attacks against Harris are particularly damaging, stating, \"Don't insult your opponent on how they look, how they speak, women can't stand that.\"Even some of Trump's former advisors are cautioning against this approach. Kellyanne Conway, who served as a senior consultant on Trump's 2016 campaign, recently appeared on Fox Business to discuss the race. She advocated for a different strategy, saying, \"The winning formula for President Trump is very plain to see it's fewer insults, more insights, and that policy contrast.\"Conway emphasized the importance of focusing on policy differences, noting that Trump has a \"two-to-one advantage over Biden-Harris on the economy and inflation, on the border, on Israel and Hamas.\" She suggested that if Trump would \"just contrast the policies, he'll win.\"As the 2024 presidential race intensifies, both candidates face significant challenges. For Harris, the task is to convince voters that she can effectively lead the country and implement her proposed policies. Her campaign has recently released a comprehensive economic policy agenda, focusing on lowering costs for American families. The proposal includes measures such as offering $25,000 to over a million first-time homebuyers with a history of timely rent payments, as well as expanding child tax credits and other tax incentives.For Trump, the challenge is to maintain discipline in his messaging and broaden his appeal beyond his core supporters. Recent polling averages show Harris leading Trump in five out of seven battleground states, buoyed by strong support from women and younger voters.The coming weeks will be crucial for both campaigns as they prepare for their first debate, scheduled for September 10 on ABC News. Trump has proposed additional debates on September 4 with Fox News and September 25 with NBC News, although the Harris campaign has not yet agreed to these dates.","summary":"The former president admitted Harris was \"beautiful\" before saying he was \"better looking\" than her during a rally in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-kamala-harris-beautiful-mocked-pennsylvania-rally-1940750","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2449707/donald-trump-kamala-harris-frank-luntz.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-17 23:17:07","author":"Adeola Adeosun","authors":["Adeola Adeosun"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.131},{"id":254343944,"title":"Kamala Harris on the hot seat for 'hiding' from American people and her 'Kamalanomics' plan to increase taxes","text":"Resounding calls for Vice President Kamala Harris to conduct press interviews are mounting after the Democratic presidential nominee unveiled her economic plan days before heading to her party's national convention in Chicago.

CNN's Jim Acosta pressed a Harris campaign spokesperson Wednesday on why she had avoided doing a press conference.

The information you need to know, sent directly to you: Download the CTV News App Trump wound back and forth between hitting his points on economic policy and delivering a smattering of insults and impressions of U.S. President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron as he held a rally in northeastern Pennsylvania. The former president has seemed to struggle to adjust to his new opponent after Democrats replaced their nominee. Over the past week, he has diverged during campaign appearances away from the policies he was billed to speak about and instead diverted to a rotation of familiar attack lines and insults. As he attacked Democrats for inflation at the top of his speech, Trump asked his crowd of supporters, “You don’t mind if I go off teleprompter for a second, do you? Joe Biden hates her.” Trump's rally in Wilkes-Barre was in a swath of a pivotal battleground state where he hopes conservative, white working-class voters near Biden’s hometown of Scranton will boost the Republican's chances of winning back the White House. His remarks Saturday came as Democrats prepare for their four-day national convention that kicks off Monday in Chicago and will mark the party's welcoming of Harris as their nominee. Her replacement of Biden less than four months before the November election has reinvigorated Democrats and their coalition. It has also presented a new challenge for Trump. Trump hammered Harris on the economy, associating her with the Biden administration’s inflation woes and likening her latest proposal against price gouging to measures in communist nations. Republican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally Wednesday, Aug. 14, 2024, in Asheville, N.C. (AP Photo/Matt Kelley) Trump has said a federal ban on price gouging for groceries would lead to food shortages, rationing and hunger. On Saturday asked why she hadn't worked to solve prices when she and Biden were sworn into office in 2021. “Day one for Kamala was three and a half years ago. So why didn’t she do it then? So this is day 1,305,\" Trump said. To address high prices, Trump said he would sign an executive order on his first day sworn in as president “directing every cabinet secretary and agency head to use every power we have to drive prices down, but we’re going to drive them down in a capitalist way, not in a communist way,” he said. He predicted financial ruin for the country, and Pennsylvania in particular, if Harris wins, citing her past opposition to fracking, an oil and gas extraction process commonly used in the state. Her campaign has tried to soften her stance on fracking, saying she would not ban it, even though that was her position when she was seeking the 2020 presidential nomination. “Your state’s going to be ruined anyway. She’s totally anti-fracking,” Trump said. But he also meandered, going from ripping the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021 to doing impressions of Macron’s French accent. America Votes: Latest U.S. election news and analysis from a Canadian perspective Trump laced in attacks on Harris’ laugh and said she was “not a very good wordsmith” and mocked the names of the CNN anchors who moderated the debate he had with Biden in June. When he began musing on Harris' recent image on the cover of Time magazine, he commented on the picture's resemblance to classic Hollywood icons Sophia Loren and Elizabeth Taylor and then took issue with a Wall Street Journal columnist remarking earlier this month on Harris' beauty. \"I am much better looking than her,\" Trump said, drawing laughs from the crowd. “I’m a better looking person than Kamala.\" He also took issue with the way his style is typically portrayed in news reports. “They will say he’s rambling. I don’t ramble. I’m a really smart guy,” he said. Trump’s Saturday rally was his fifth at the arena in Wilkes-Barre, the largest city in Luzerne County, where he has had victories in the past two elections. Biden bested Trump in neighboring Lackawanna County, where the Democrat has long promoted his working-class roots in Scranton. On Sunday, Harris plans a bus tour starting in Pittsburgh, with a stop in Rochester, a small town to the north. Trump has scheduled a visit Monday to a plant that manufactures nuclear fuel containers in York. Trump's running mate JD Vance is expected to be in Philadelphia that day. Some of Biden's loyal supporters in this former industrial city of 76,000 were upset to see party leaders put pressure on the president to step aside. Sign up for breaking news alerts from CTV News, right at your fingertips Diane Munley, 63, says she called dozens of members of Congress to vouch for Biden. Munley eventually came to terms with Biden's decision and is now very supportive of Harris. “I can’t deny the enthusiasm that’s been going on with this ticket right now. I am so into it,” Munley said. “It just wasn’t happening with Joe, and I couldn’t see it at the time because I was so connected to him.” Robert A. Bridy, 64, a laborer from Shamokin, Pa., traveled on Saturday to the rally to show support for Trump. He said the election feels tight in this state and added that his union and a close friend are trying to convince him to vote for Harris and other Democrats, but he has voted for Trump since 2016. Bridy called Trump a “working class guy like us.” Trump is a billionaire who built his fortune in real estate. “He’s a fighter,” Bridy said. “I’d like to see the closed borders. He doesn’t mess around. He goes at it right away and takes care of business the way it should be.” ___ Price reported from New York.

But those who followed her career closely saw a mixed record. As a prosecutor, she faced public outcry for refusing to seek the death penalty for a man convicted of killing a young police officer. And then as attorney-general, she upheld the state’s death penalty despite her personal opposition. Having reached the peaks of California state politics, she was elected to the US Senate the same night that Donald Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. In her brief tenure, she made headlines for her searing and direct questioning of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh during his testy 2018 confirmation hearings. “Can you think of any laws that give government the power to make decisions about the male body?” she asked the Trump appointee, in an exchange that cascaded across social media and late night television. Like Mr Obama, she was a young senator of limitless ambition. Halfway through her first term, she launched a presidential campaign. That campaign, like this one, was met with great fanfare. More than 20,000 people gathered in her hometown of Oakland, California, for its launch. But her effort to become the Democratic nominee sputtered and collapsed before the first presidential primary ballot was even cast. Ms Harris failed to carve out a clear political identity and distinguish herself in a field of rivals that included Mr Biden and left-wing senator Bernie Sanders. Critics said she endorsed a range of progressive policies but seemed to lack clear conviction. A breakthrough June 2019 debate moment in which she challenged her then-opponent Mr Biden’s record on the racial desegregation of schools resulted in a brief surge in polling.

In several Instagram posts, Emhoff said that during her younger years, she had a spinal condition, and she suggested ketamine as a remedy for pain, the New York Post reported Saturday: VP Kamala Harris’ stepdaughter Ella Emhoff pushes ketamine, ‘shorter work days’ in ‘pain management’ rant pic.twitter.com/CcvGt4PnDd— New York Post (@nypost) August 17, 2024 The outlet continued: “I was born with a tethered spine (iykyk) which caused my back to not properly lengthen when I was growing and caused a kyphosis (hunchback),” Emhoff, 25, with her face covered in Hello Kitty stickers, wrote to her 345,000 followers on Tuesday.…“Was in and out of doctors and PT for most of my adolescence Got lower back surgery grew a million inches and now deal with chronic pain,” she continued. In a subsequent post, Emhoff shared a link to a Google document wherein she listed ketamine infusion as a pain therapy. In 2022, John F. Kennedy International Airport port director for Customs and Border Protection Sal Ingrassia told Fox News there had been a “surprising” rise in the amount of ketamine coming in, according to – News. “The uptick has been surprising, the amount of ketamine coming in. We know it’s being used as a party drug. Ketamine was originally — the original purpose was a horse tranquilizer,” Ingrassia said. “That’s what ketamine was used for, and now they’ve found ways to use that as a drug. And it’s really concerning when you see a large amount like that and it’s concerning that it’s being used in a cocktail-type format with other drugs like fentanyl,” he added. C-SPAN According to the Associated Press (AP), the surgical drug known as ketamine has been used as an alternative to opioids for those trying to manage chronic pain, the outlet reported in 2023. “Ketamine was approved more than 50 years ago as a powerful anesthetic for patients undergoing surgery. At lower doses, it can produce psychedelic, out-of-body experiences, which made it a popular club drug in the 1990s. With its recent adoption for pain, patients are increasingly encountering those same effects,” the report said.

The reality TV star, 71, is no stranger to being outspoken, and her most recent statement is not only topical, but one many Swifties may agree with. Attending night three of Taylor’s second round of London shows at Wembley, the Celebrity Big Brother star was spotted in a white sweater begging the Grammy winner to try her luck in the presidential race. Sporting her usual red hair, a pearl necklace and matching earrings, the star grinned as she posed in the jumper, which read ‘Taylor For President 2024’. The US presidential race is currently in full swing, with Democratic leader Kamala Harris and Republican leader and former President Donald Trump both campaigning for a seat in the White House. The election is due to take place on November 5, 2024.

Meanwhile, Ed Sheeran joined the singer on stage for a special performance to her 92,000 person strong crowd also on Thursday.

The theory was spawned on social media after eagle-eyed fans saw a typewriter symbol featured on posters beside the Friday show date. Taylor and the star, real name Austin Richard Post, collaborated on the song Fortnight from her latest album, The Tortured Poets Department, and included multiple typewriters in the music video. However, despite the strong theory, the singer did not welcome her friend on stage. She did, however, debut a new bedazzled bodysuit as part of the Midnights era. Taylor will finish her almost 150-date tour in December (Picture: TAS2024/Getty Images) The Eras Tour is the top-grossing music tour in history (Picture: Kate Green/Getty Images) The Zuhair Murad costume featured multiple sparkly moons and was accessorised with her signature knee-high sparkly boots and a garter belt. Taylor will take a brief break from the stage tomorrow night before returning on Monday and Tuesday in what will be her final London shows before returning to North America. The Eras Tour is believed to have grossed over $1.04 billion, making it the highest-grossing music tour in history. It began on March 17, 2023, and will conclude on December 8, 2024. In total, Taylor will have performed almost 150 shows on five continents. Got a story?

Kennedy Jr.","text":"It wasn’t long ago that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s campaign—amid his unsuccessful lawsuit against Daily Kos to reveal the identity of a community member who dared criticize his interaction with neo-Nazis in Berlin—was taken seriously by the political press. He was polling favorably among the public, often with Republicans delighted at his anti-vaccine activism and shots at President Joe Biden. His independent presidential bid was being financed largely by Republican megadonors eager to see him eat into Biden’s support. As recently as early July, a Pew Research Center poll had him garnering 15% of the national vote. Now? He’s all but forgotten, a loser trying—and failing—to trade his endorsement to both Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris for a Cabinet position. Kennedy is, as we’ve long established, a bad man. He thinks America’s gun epidemic is caused by video games and antidepressant medications. He thinks Wi-Fi and cell phones cause brain tumors, like glioblastoma. (My father died of glioblastoma before either Wi-Fi or cell phones were common.) Kennedy thinks chemicals in drinking water make people gay or transgender. He said COVID-19 vaccine mandates were worse than Nazi Germany: “Even in Hitler’s Germany, you could cross the Alps into Switzerland. You can hide in an attic, like Anne Frank did.” Can someone please tell him what happened to Anne Frank? He even thinks I’m a CIA agent. And all that is before you get to his extremely dangerous anti-vaccine work. A March 2021 report by the Center for Countering Digital Hate, which monitors online hate speech and disinformation, found that just 12 people were responsible for a whopping 73% of vaccine misinformation on Facebook—and No. 2 on their list? Kennedy. More recently, he “won” Politifact’s 2023 “Lie of the Year” for his body of conspiracy theories. It was a stretch that Kennedy would hurt the Democratic presidential ticket. Not only do his views often line up with the QAnon conspiratorial right, but also the main media outlets willing to platform him were right-wing. Indeed, his presence on conservative media was so pervasive that even Trump’s people sounded the alarm. “It is concerning and beyond logic,” Trump campaign co-manager Chris LaCivita told Politico. “They see an opening, they see a robust ecosystem on the right that they can pull votes from,” Matt Gorman, a former communications adviser for South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott’s presidential campaign, told Politico. “I think sometimes, Republicans tend to lull ourselves into believing, ‘Oh, he’s just taking votes from Biden.’ No, he’s going after everybody.” A Politico analysis of Kennedy’s media appearances the first four months of 2024 found that nearly half of his 69 media appearances were on right-wing outlets. The joke is on them. Kennedy draws support disproportionately from Trump, according to an April poll conducted for NBC News. That alignment in Kennedy, his base, and Trump was made extra clear when the two met in July, at the Republican National Convention, in a meeting brokered by former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, which should tell you everything you need to know. Here’s The New York Times: The independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. met with former President Donald J. Trump on Monday in Milwaukee, a remarkable encounter in the hours before Mr. Trump officially became the Republican nominee. The Kennedy campaign confirmed the meeting after early reports of the encounter stirred speculation that Mr. Kennedy was planning to drop out of the race and possibly endorse Mr. Trump. That story was published on July 15, and exactly one week later, The Washington Post reported that in that meeting and other conversations, Kennedy and Trump discussed an endorsement from Kennedy and a potential role—possibly a Cabinet position—in a second Trump administration. On Thursday, The Washington Post also reported that Kennedy had reached out to the Harris campaign for a meeting with the vice president “to discuss the possibility of serving in her administration, perhaps as a Cabinet secretary, if he throws his support behind her campaign and she wins, according to Kennedy campaign officials.” Trump has rebuffed Kennedy (so far), and the Harris campaign isn’t even entertaining a conversation. Harries and her allies are essentially ignoring him, as they should. Can you imagine his delusions in even asking? Kennedy has no other options. He’s nowhere to be seen on the trail. His campaign is broke. His poll numbers, which hovered around 10% before Biden ended his reelection bid, have cratered since Harris entered the race, falling to the 5% range. His friends in the conservative media are abandoning him, and he’s now making headlines only when it highlights his weirdness: Brain worms! Dead bear cub! Allegedly eating a dog! Hell, the bear-cub story isn’t just weird—he tried to preempt The New Yorker’s article about it by issuing a video of him telling the story to Roseanne Barr, of all people. Apparently, the racist comedian is the only person left who will talk to him. Kennedy was only a part of the 2024 cycle because right-wing media and donors pushed him out there and the traditional press took the bait. Now, that fad is over and he’s slinking back into ignominy.","summary":"It wasn’t long ago that Robert F.

Joe Rogan’s stand-up comedy is not very good. Some could argue that it’s objectively awful. For those in doubt, feel free to check out his latest Netflix special, \"Burn the Boats.\" After a six-year hiatus, following 2018’s \"Strange Times,\" itself an underwhelming affair, \"Burn the Boats\" was highly anticipated. Rogan spent four years preparing for this moment, even opening his own comedy club in Austin to refine his material. Consider the output of Rogan’s close friends — Mark Normand, Shane Gillis, and Tony Hinchcliffe. Watching them perform feels like seeing a fleet of F1 cars zoom by while an old Lada stutters along in the background. Unfortunately, the special fails to live up to expectations, leaving fans and critics alike questioning whether Rogan has lost his comedic edge entirely — or if he ever had one to begin with. Old jokes One of the most glaring issues with \"Burn the Boats\" is Rogan’s reliance on old material and tired jokes. For a comedian of his stature, all these years of preparation should have resulted in fresh, original content. Instead, the special feels like a retread of his past work, with recycled jokes and premises that longtime fans have already heard. This includes a masturbation joke that Rogan first told in his 2010 special, \"Talking Monkeys in Space.\" Repeating old content is considered a cardinal sin in comedy, yet Rogan shamelessly resorts to it, betraying the trust of his audience. For a comedian with his reputation, this laziness is inexcusable. To be clear, the 57-year-old is a phenomenal podcaster, a skilled interviewer, and an affable personality who can engage with a wide range of guests, from UFC fighters to philosophers. However, the qualities that make him a great podcaster do not translate to stand-up comedy. The sad reality is that Rogan is not a great comic; he’s not even a good one. In \"Burn the Boats\" he attempts to make up for his lack of content by shouting and making weird faces, but these antics only serve to highlight the weakness of his material. 'Meathead nonsense' Rogan recently angered many of his fans by essentially endorsing RFK Jr. and praising a speech by Kamala Harris. While Rogan is certainly entitled to his own political opinions, his latest special risks alienating not just his fan base but also comedy purists in general. \"Burn the Boats\" has effectively burned Rogan’s credibility as a comedian. With an IMDb rating of just 4.8, the special has been met with brutal — and accurate — criticism from viewers. One disgruntled viewer expressed frustration: “You expect a certain amount of meathead nonsense and conspiracy talk which may or may not be genuine. But the thing I've always found grating has now become a constant in this show: yelling everything as though he doesn't have a microphone.” Another viewer echoed this sentiment: “'Burn the Boats' ... is a colossal disappointment. The performance is plagued by excessive yelling and exaggerated expressions, which quickly become tiresome.” But all is not lost. Rogan still has at least one high-profile fan. Adam Sandler recently appeared on \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" and lauded the special. However, it’s important to note that the Brooklyn-born banterer is an actor — and a very good one at that. The manner in which he praised Rogan as a comic — without actually laughing — was so convincing that it was almost Oscar-worthy. Sandler’s commendation felt more like a courtesy nod to a fellow entertainer than a genuine endorsement of Rogan’s comedic abilities. Movieweb aptly labeled the special a “boring showcase for the Dunning-Kruger effect,\" and frankly, it’s hard to argue with that assessment. The whole affair felt like a master class in how not to be self-aware. Rogan stumbled through jokes that landed with the thud of a bad Yelp (or IMDb) review. Sycophant psych-out In stark contrast, consider the output of Rogan’s close friends — Mark Normand, Shane Gillis, and Tony Hinchcliffe — all comedic powerhouses in their own right. Watching them perform feels like seeing a fleet of F1 cars zoom by while an old Lada stutters along in the background. The contrast in speed, skill, and sheer entertainment is undeniable. Normand’s rapid-fire wit, Gillis’s razor-sharp observations, and Hinchcliffe’s caustic jabs only serve to accentuate Rogan’s deficiencies. Jay Mohr, another stand-up comic renowned for his comedic dexterity, astutely observed that Rogan is surrounded by sycophants — individuals who either lack the courage or are too eager to perform at his comedy club to tell him when he's missing the mark. One can't help but think this insular, emperor's-new-clothes bubble of adulation has allowed Rogan's ego to inflate unchecked, leading to audience frustration and scathing reviews. As far as comedy goes, I am no longer interested in buying what he’s selling. The ship has sailed, and that boat has been thoroughly burned. Joe Rogan is talented, but he's certainly not funny.","summary":"This article is bound to provoke strong reactions, so let’s not waste any time angering the masses.

On Saturday, the campaign announced it is reserving $370 million in advertising from September to November. The Harris campaign decided to book television advertisements early so it could secure the best ad spots on the most viewed programs including, but not limited to, the major sports, ABC’s Grey’s Anatomy, Abbott Elementary, and the Golden Bachelorette, as well as CBS’s Survivor. Daytime Fox News viewers are also being targeted in the ad blitz, as campaign officials believe that is when the network has a “more moderate audience.” Harris campaign officials said it is a strategic move to court Republicans who aligned with former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley in the GOP primary. President Joe Biden and Harris have made numerous efforts to appeal to Republicans who supported Haley over former President Donald Trump in the primary and have criticized the GOP presidential nominee for not doing enough to earn the support of Haley fans. Television ads will account for $170 million, but as Harris has leaned into online campaigning to target young voters, her team is reserving even more money, $200 million, for digital advertising. By comparison, nearly 80% of the 2020 Biden campaign’s initial reservation was used on television ads. “This is a modern campaign in 2024 and we’re not just stuck in the times of old, where 80 percent of the budget has to be on television,” Harris’s principal deputy campaign manager, Quentin Fulks, told the New York Times. In the fall, Harris will launch more national ads in addition to continuing to advertise in swing states such as Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. She will also spend more than double her $150 million summer ad blitz. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER Trump’s campaign has only reserved $44 million worth of television ads after Labor Day, and in just two states: Pennsylvania and Georgia.

(AP) — Tim Walz touted his Nebraska roots Saturday in his first trip back to his home state since becoming the Democratic vice presidential nominee, and drew sharp contrasts between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. Playing to the crowd, Walz noted his love of Nebraska football and joked about the historical significance of the Stonehenge replica built out of classic cars known as Carhenge that sits near where he taught in the Panhandle. He then emphasized the values he learned growing up of helping neighbors and minding everyone’s own business. “More than anything else — just like here in Nebraska — Minnesota’s strength comes from our values,” he said about the state he serves as governor. Walz stressed that he and Harris believe in helping all Americans succeed — not just the millionaires and billionaires he said Trump wants to help. It was all part of his appeal for the lone electoral vote in Omaha’s swing Second Congressional District that can be split off from the rest of the heavily Republican state. Going after Republicans as intrusive in people’s everyday lives, Walz said the fact they want to make decisions about Americans’ health care including abortion rights and try to hurt Social Security is “not just weird, it’s dangerous. And when they try to overturn elections, that’s not just weird, it’s un-American.” He said Trump and his fellow Republicans are “super concerned with our bedrooms, our exam rooms and libraries.” Nebraska Democrats Chairwoman Jane Kleeb joked near the start of the event that Omaha has a new nickname, “Kamaha,” as she encouraged everyone at the rally to work hard to elect Harris and Walz in November. Supporters hope Walz’s knowledge of rural America — he grew up in the small towns of Valentine and Butte in the Sandhills — could help Democrats appeal to wide swaths of Republican strongholds where they have rarely been competitive in recent elections. His appearance in Omaha also reinforces the campaign’s interest in securing the single electoral vote that comes with winning the swing 2nd District that Joe Biden secured in 2020 and Barack Obama in 2008. Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance is expected to visit Omaha next week for a private fundraiser hosted by Nebraska Sen. Pete Ricketts. “I think it just proves the importance that we as the blue dot — CD2 — has,” Omaha teacher Wes Jensen said. Former state Sen. Al Davis, who represented the Panhandle town of Alliance where Walz taught for six years before moving to Minnesota after meeting his wife, said he thinks Walz “can speak to rural parts of the country in ways that other candidates never could do.” He added, “so I’m hoping that that will turn some votes in rural parts of Nebraska and across the Midwest.” Alliance residents are planning a local rally of their own next week to watch Walz speak at the Democratic convention in Chicago. Even before Walz took the stage in Omaha, the Republican National Committee accused the Kamala Harris-Walz ticket of not representing “Midwestern values” and said Nebraska voters “will send a resounding message” when they help put the former president back in office. Bill McCamley of Lincoln said he remembers that Walz, now the governor of Minnesota, was interested in government when he taught him social studies in the seventh grade in Valentine but he never expected him to go on to become governor or perhaps vice president someday. McCamley said Walz came up with the idea on his own in the seventh grade to build a veterans memorial for everyone from Cherry County who had served in the military, and then he convinced local leaders to build a sidewalk for the memorial. “I went with him, but he did the job. He talked to them and said this is that idea. This is what I want to do,” McCamley said. “Then he got that he got them to agree to go along with it. I thought that was pretty impressive.” McCamley had to call the state Democratic Party to get access to Saturday’s rally after the online registration system was shut down once 10,000 had expressed interest in attending the rally at a theater in the Omaha suburb of La Vista that’s only designed to hold about 2,500 people. However unlikely it is, McCamley hoped for a chance to reconnect with his former student and jokingly confront him about a valentine he gave his daughter, Julie Long, when the two dated in the seventh grade. Long said she hung onto the valentine Walz gave her for a lot of years because the message declaring, “Ours is a strange and wonderful relationship,” made her laugh. On the inside, the card said, “You’re strange and I’m wonderful.” “That kind of sums up his humor,” said Long who used to compete with Walz to see which one of them was smarter because her dad was a teacher and his was the superintendent there. They both moved away in high school and Long lost track of Walz — outside of a chance meeting when both of them lived in the Panhandle — until she noticed him showing up in the news as governor dealing with difficult problems like the protests that followed George Floyd’s murder at the hands of Minneapolis police. After dealing with that unrest and managing to pass key priorities like protections for abortion and free lunches for school kids, Walz has a long list of accomplishments that will appeal to Democratic voters. But Long said Walz might also appeal to Republicans because he is smart, funny and cares about helping people. “I think if people are willing to listen — really listen — to the things that he says and, and those kinds of things, that it will open some doors,” said Long who lives in Hot Springs, South Dakota, and won’t be able to accompany her dad to the rally.","summary":"Supporters hope Walz's knowledge of rural America could help Democrats appeal to wide swaths of Republican strongholds where they have rarely been competitive in recent elections.","url":"https://www.twincities.com/2024/08/17/walz-touts-nebraska-roots-in-visit-to-his-home-state-where-theres-a-battle-over-one-electoral-vote/","image":"https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TCFallback.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-17 22:35:32","author":"Josh Funk","authors":["Josh Funk"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.059},{"id":254342938,"title":"Kamala Harris planning $370M ad blitz in battleground states after Labor Day","text":"Vice President Harris’ presidential campaign has reserved $370 million to inundate battleground states with ads in the eight weeks before election day.

Trump wound back and forth between hitting his points on economic policy and delivering a smattering of insults and impressions of President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron as he held a rally in northeastern Pennsylvania. As he attacked Democrats for inflation, he asked his crowd of supporters, “You don’t mind if I go off teleprompter for a second, do you? Joe Biden hates her.” Trump’s rally was in a swath of the pivotal battleground state where he hopes conservative, white working-class voters near Biden’s hometown will boost the Republican’s chances of winning back the White House. His remarks Saturday came as Democrats prepare for their four-day national convention that kicks off Monday in Chicago and will mark the party’s welcoming of Harris as their nominee. Her replacement of Biden with less than four months before the November election reinvigorated Democrats and their coalition, and has presented a new challenge for Trump. Trump laced in attacks on Harris’ laugh and said she was “not a very good wordsmith” and mocked the names of the CNN anchors who moderated the debate he had with Biden in June. He also hammered Harris on the economy, associating her with the Biden administration’s inflation woes and likening her latest proposal against price gouging to measures in communist nations. Trump has said a federal ban on price gouging for groceries would lead to food shortages, rationing and hunger and on Saturday asked why she hadn’t worked to solve prices when she and Biden were sworn into office in 2021. “Day one for Kamala was three and a half years ago. So why didn’t she do it then? So this is day 1,305,” Trump said. He maundered in his remarks from the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021 to doing impressions of Macron’s French accent. But he took issue with the way his free-wheeling style is typically portrayed in news reports. “They will say he’s rambling. I don’t ramble. I’m a really smart guy.” “I don’t ramble.” He predicted financial ruin for the country and Pennsylvania in particular if Harris wins, citing her past opposition to fracking, an oil and gas extraction process. “Your state’s going to be ruined anyway. She’s totally anti-fracking,” Trump said. In 2016 and 2020, Trump crushed his Democratic rivals in the county that is home to blue-collar Wilkes-Barre. The Rust Belt region, home to Biden’s native Scranton, offers Trump hope and helps him spotlight Democratic vulnerabilities after the president ended his reelection bid and Harris launched her campaign. Her campaign has tried to soften her stance on fracking, saying she would not ban it, even though that was her position when she was seeking the 2020 presidential nomination. Some Democrats in Pennsylvania acknowledge the challenges but say the economy is what concerns most people in the area. Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. Austin Davis said in an interview that voters are “really fired up.” David Harris’ rally in Philadelphia to introduce her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, along with 36 field offices, including several in more Republican-leaning parts of the state. “The energy has clearly shifted in a dramatic way toward Vice President Harris,” Davis said. He argued that Trump “just goes on rambling rants and just makes personal attacks on Harris.” On Sunday, Harris plans a bus tour starting in Pittsburgh, with a stop in Rochester, a small town to the north. Trump has scheduled a visit Monday to a plant that manufactures nuclear fuel containers in York. Trump’s running mate JD Vance is expected to be in Philadelphia that day. Trump’s Saturday rally is his fifth at the arena in Wilkes-Barre, the largest city in Luzerne County, where he has had victories the past two elections. Biden bested Trump in neighboring Lackawanna County, where the Democrat has long promoted his working-class roots in Scranton. Some of Biden’s loyal supporters in this former industrial city of 76,000 were upset to see party leaders put pressure the president to step aside. Diane Munley, 63, says she called dozens of members of Congress to vouch for Biden. Munley eventually came to terms with Biden’s decision and is now very supportive of Harris. “I can’t deny the enthusiasm that’s been going on with this ticket right now. I am so into it,” Munley said. “It just wasn’t happening with Joe, and I couldn’t see it at the time because I was so connected to him.” She said she does not know a Democrat or even independent in her circle of a couple hundred people who is not fully committed to Harris and Walz. “We are all-in on Kamala Harris,” Munley said. “All in 110%.” Robert A.

John Lewis, D-Ga., on Friday. The monument stood in Decatur, Ga, before being torn down for the sake of so-called racial justice during the 2020 George Floyd riots, which killed at least 25 people and totaled damages of a surplus of $2 billion. The monument was initially erected in 1908 by the United Daughters of the Confederacy, an organization of descendants of Confederate soldiers who have spent 128 years preserving its history. To some, these memorial statues and markers are viewed as divisive and thus unworthy of being allowed to remain in public places. To others, they simply represent a memorial to our forefathers who fought bravely during four years of war. These memorial statues and markers have been a part of the Southern landscape for decades. The group’s president general, Jinny Widowski, added in the statement that they denounce hate groups and that “diversity is what makes our nation stronger.” The United Daughters of the Confederacy totally denounces any individual or group that promotes racial divisiveness or white supremacy. And we call on these people to cease using Confederate symbols for their abhorrent and reprehensible purposes. This did not appease race-based NGOs, including Hate Free Decatur and the NAACP’s Beacon Hill Black Alliance, who targeted the monument in 2017. In light of the death of George Flyod and surrounding unrest, the city requested a Georgia judge to eliminate the historical relic after numerous vandalism attempts. It was regarded as a safety concern, reported CNN. According to the AP, the new statue on the site is 12 feet tall and designed by Jamaican sculptor Basil Watson, who has committed all of his work to black figures. He said this new revisionism is “exciting for the city because of what he represents and what it’s replacing.” Lewis has been considered vital to the Civil Rights Movement, encouraging civilians to get in “good trouble.” His rhetoric carried over to recent years, such as during the 2020 BLM riots, pushing the defund the police movement and so-called “racial equity.” “The way this young man died, watching the video, it made me so sad. It was so painful. It made me cry. I kept saying to myself, how many more? How many more young black men will be murdered? The madness must stop.” — @RepJohnLewis on the death of George Floyd pic.twitter.com/tJ5mVfcmoZ— CBS Mornings (@CBSMornings) June 4, 2020 The Georgia congressman died in 2020 after a battle with pancreatic cancer and has been honored by being laid in state in Washington, DC.

Meanwhile, Walz enlisted in the Army National Guard at the age of 17 and served for 24 years before retiring in 2005.Whaley, who served two decades in the U.S. Army, explained how the vice presidential candidates from both parties can best champion veterans' issues.\"I think most veterans would like to see a robust discussion on the issues that are most important to veterans and we poll our veterans across the nation and they will tell you that it's important that we have a discussion around veteran benefits, around veteran homelessness, and then access to health care,\" Whaley said.But how much of a difference could veteran voters and voters who care about veterans' issues make in November's election?\"Of the veterans that we poll, 97 percent are registered to vote,\" Whaley said. \"When you think about 18.5 million veterans in our country, that's not a small number.\"Whaley said that number gets bigger when you factor in veterans' families, caregivers, spouses and dependents.\"That's a sizable block of voters that feel that veterans issues are very important,\" he said.When asked how Vance plans to champion veterans' issues, Luke Schroeder, a spokesman for the senator, told Newsweek via email on Saturday afternoon: \"The Trump-Vance administration will do more for veterans and our military than any other administration in modern history. They'll ensure veterans receive the respect, treatment, and benefits they deserve, while also pursuing peace through strength on the world stage to prevent unnecessary wars in the future.\"He continued: \"In his first term, President Trump's VA Mission Act passed Congress with overwhelming bipartisan support. The legislation expanded veterans' access to quality care and cut needless red tape, but Tim Walz voted no. That's not the kind of leadership veterans need in Washington.\"Newsweek has reached out to Harris' campaign via email for comment on Saturday afternoon.What Issues Are Veterans Facing?According to Whaley, food insecurity, underemployment, homelessness, and suicide are some of the issues plaguing the veteran community.\"We have nearly 1. 4 million veterans struggling with food insecurity in our country and over 60 percent of veterans report that they're underemployed due to a systemic mismatching in their skills and education,\" he said.Even current servicemembers struggle with food insecurity. Whaley said, \"Twenty-four percent of active-duty military have food insecurity issues.\"There are anywhere from 30,000 to 40,000 veterans experiencing homelessness every night and 17 to 20 veterans take their lives every single day, Whaley said.\"It should not be a surprise that we're having struggles as a nation in recruitment efforts, all those things are intertwined,\" he said, adding that the struggles that veterans are facing \"is a national security issue that should be discussed and should be debated.Last fiscal year, the military services collectively missed its recruitment goals by roughly 41,000 recruits, according to U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) official Ashish Vazirani.\"It would be great if both campaigns present a plan to help veterans transition to civilian life because right now that's not working,\" Whaley added.Vance/Walz Military Service DramaAs the race to the White House heats up, Vance has criticized a recently resurfaced comment Walz made about being in combat from a political event in 2018, accusing the Minnesota governor of lying about his military service.\"What bothers me about Tim Waltz is the stolen valor garbage. Do not pretend to be something that you're not,\" Vance told reporters in Michigan on August 7.Speaking about gun control, Walz, who was a U.S. representative at the time, said in the 2018 clip, \"We can make sure that those weapons of war that I carried in war is the only place where those weapons are at.\"However, Walz never went to war. The Harris-Walz campaign recently said that the Minnesota governor \"misspoke\" at the time and Walz previously acknowledged that he never saw combat in an NPR News interview, in which he said, \"I know that there are certainly folks that did far more than I did.\"Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, a Democrat and a veteran himself said on CNN last Sunday a veteran disparaging another veteran \"goes against certainly everything I learned during my time in service.\"Meanwhile, at a campaign event in Los Angeles on Tuesday, Walz said, \"To anyone brave enough to put on that uniform for our great country, including my opponent, I just have a few simple words: Thank you for your service and sacrifice.\"When asked how veterans felt about the recent Vance/Walz drama, Whaley said that he could only go based on the conversations he's been having with veterans as Mission Roll Call has not polled this question.\"From the ones I speak to at different events and just normal life and those that I've served with and others we want to see the big problem solved,\" Whaley said. \"We want to see the issues that are really affecting veterans' lives. If you're struggling to get food on the table, I don't think you really are paying attention to this banter that's going on.\"Whaley did say that he thinks Vance and Walz \"honor and love their time and service.\"\"They both signed a blank check to serve their country.

(AP) — Of the thousands of delegates expected to gather Monday at the Democratic National Convention, just 36 will belong to the “uncommitted” movement sparked by dissatisfaction with President Joe Biden‘s handling of the Israel–Hamas war. But that small core has outsized influence. Anger over U.S. backing for Israel’s offensive in Gaza could generate unwelcome images for convention organizers, with raucous protests expected outside and potentially inside the Chicago arena where Harris will accept the nomination Thursday. Top Democrats have spent weeks meeting with “uncommitted” voters and their allies — including a previously unreported sit-down between Vice President Kamala Harris and the mayor of Dearborn, Michigan — in an effort to respond to criticism in key swing states like Michigan, which has a significant Arab American population. Weeks of meetings and calls between pro-Palestinian activists and the Harris campaign have yielded progress in some areas, but their core policy demands remain unmet. The activists want Harris to endorse an arms embargo to Israel and a permanent cease-fire. Harris has supported Biden’s negotiations for a cease-fire but rejected an arms embargo. Rima Mohammad, one of Michigan’s two “uncommitted” delegates, said she sees the convention as a chance to share their movement’s concerns with the party leadership. “It is a way for protesters outside to be able to share their frustration with the party,” she said. The Democratic nominee meets a key Arab American mayor Questions remain about the leverage “uncommitted” voters hold now that Biden has stepped aside and Harris has taken his place. Democrats have seen a significant surge in enthusiasm for Harris’ campaign and concerns about voter apathy in key areas, such as Detroit’s large Black population, appear to have diminished. But Harris and her team have still made communication with Arab American leaders a priority.During a campaign trip to Michigan last week, Harris met with Abdullah Hammoud, the 34-year-old mayor of Dearborn, a Detroit suburb that has the largest number of Arab Americans of any city in the United States. The meeting was disclosed by a person who was not authorized to discuss it publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The person familiar with the meeting did not provide specific details but said the focus was on Harris’ potential policy, if elected, on the Israel-Hamas conflict. Hammoud declined to comment. “Vice President Harris supports the deals currently on the table for a permanent cease-fire in Gaza and for the release of hostages,” her campaign said in a statement. “She will continue to meet with leaders from Palestinian, Muslim, Israeli and Jewish communities, as she has throughout her vice presidency.” According to a source familiar with convention planning, two panel discussions will take place during the convention in Chicago: one addressing Arab and Palestinian issues with leaders from the “Uncommitted” movement, and another focused on Jewish American issues, including the rise in antisemitism and hate speech. Campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez on Thursday held separate one-on-one meetings with leaders in the Arab American community and “uncommitted” movement in metro Detroit. “They are listening and we are talking,” said Osama Siblani, publisher of The Arab American News, who met with Chavez Rodriguez. “But none of us can garner votes in the community without public statements from Harris. She doesn’t need us; she can win over votes by saying and doing the right thing.” According to Siblani, Chavez Rodriguez agreed that “the killing has to stop.” In response, Siblani said he pressed: “How? There is no plan.” Lavora Barnes, the Democratic chair in Michigan, said the party would “continue working toward our goal of coming together to defeat Donald Trump and Republicans up and down the ballot.” “We are committed to continuing these conversations with community leaders, activists and organizations because we want to ensure that everyone in the Michigan Democratic Party has a seat at the table,” Barnes said in a statement. No agreement on an arms embargo Some on the Democratic Party’s left have called for including a moratorium on the use of U.S.-made weapons by Israel in the platform of policy goals that will be approved during next week’s convention. But such language isn’t included in a draft platform party officials released earlier this summer, and it’s unlikely that those close to Harris’ campaign would endorse including it. The Uncommitted National Movement has also requested a speaking slot at the convention for a doctor who has worked on the frontlines in Gaza, along with a leader of the movement. And they have asked for a meeting with Harris “to discuss updating the Gaza policy in hopes of stopping the flow of unconditional weapons and bombs” to Israel, said Abbas Alawieh, another “uncommitted” delegate from Michigan and one of the founders of the movement. Before a Harris rally just outside Detroit last week, Alawieh and Layla Elabed, co-founders of the movement, briefly met with the vice president. They requested a formal meeting with Harris and urged her to support an embargo on weapons shipments to Israel. According to them, Harris seemed open to the idea of meeting. However, shortly after news of the meeting became public, Harris’ national security adviser Phil Gordon reaffirmed that she does not support an arms embargo. Alawieh mentioned Wednesday that the group has not received any further response from Harris’ team or the DNC regarding their requests ahead of the convention. Since then, leaders of the “Uncommitted” movement have met with senior staff from the DNC and the Harris campaign to discuss their requests. “I hope she doesn’t miss the opportunity to unite the party,” said Alawieh. The Trump campaign continues its outreach Elsewhere in metro Detroit this week, Massad Boulos, the father-in-law of Trump’s youngest daughter and now a leader in his Arab American outreach, was holding meetings with various community groups. Boulos has come to Michigan often for the outreach, along with Arab Americans for Trump chair Bishara Bahbah. According to Bahbah, their pitch highlights the situation in Gaza under Biden’s administration and a promise from Trump’s team to give the community a seat at the table if he wins. “We have been told by the Trump circle, which is not part of the campaign, that in return for our votes, there would be a seat at the table and a voice to be heard,” said Bahbah. But any apparent political opportunity for Trump in the Arab American community or the “uncommitted” movement may be limited by his past remarks and policies. Many Arabs remain offended by Trump’s ban, while in office, on immigration from several majority Muslim countries as well as remarks they consider insulting. Trump also has criticized Biden for not being a strong enough supporter of Israel. Speaking to an audience of Jewish supporters Thursday, Trump painted the protesters expected in Chicago as antisemitic and invoked an Arabic term that is sometimes used by Muslims to mean war or struggle. “There will be no jihad coming to America under Trump,” he said. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER But Bahbah acknowledges that his and Boulos’ strategy isn’t necessarily aimed at converting voters to support Trump — but to stop them from voting for Harris. “If I can’t convince people to vote for Trump, having them sit at home is better,” said Bahbah.

The group, known as Storm-1679, generated articles and social-media comments to shape public opinion around Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, according to OpenAI. In addition to targeting 2024 U.S. presidential candidates, OpenAI said Storm-1679 also generated content around Israel’s invasion of Gaza and its presence at the 2024 Olympics, the rights of U.S.-based Latinx communities, Venezuelan politics, and Scottish independence from the U.K. Most of the posts and articles spotted by OpenAI received little pickup from real people, the company said. Still, it described the incident in detail on its blog, writing that it found a dozen X (formerly Twitter) accounts posing as conservatives and progressives and using hashtags such as “#DumpTrump” and “#DumpKamala.” Storm-1679 also tapped at least one Instagram account to spread AI-generated content, per OpenAI. OpenAI has previously described “state-affiliated threat actors” using its tools, but this is the first time it’s disclosed a specific election interference campaign utilizing ChatGPT. OpenAI said it responded to said discovery by banning a “cluster” of accounts that created the content; the company also said it “shared threat intelligence with government, campaign, and industry stakeholders.” The firm did not name those stakeholders specifically, but it did share screenshots of a few of the posts. Those screenshots featured view counts ranging from 8 to 207 views and hardly any likes. OpenAI said Storm-1679 also shared ChatGPT-generated articles across several websites that “posed as both progressive and conservative news outlets.” The firm added, “The majority of social media posts that we identified received few or no likes, shares, or comments. We similarly did not find indications of the web articles being shared across social media.” An August 6 report from Microsoft described Storm-2035 in a similar manner — as an Iranian network with “four websites masquerading as news outlets.” According to Microsoft, the network created “polarizing” posts about the election, LGBTQIA+ rights, as well as Israel’s invasion of Gaza. Reports of online foreign interference in U.S. elections are now virtually commonplace. Microsoft’s August 6 report, for example, also detailed an Iran-linked phishing attack that targeted an unnamed, “high-ranking” U.S. campaign official. Shortly after Microsoft dropped the report, the Trump campaign announced that “foreign sources” had stolen some of its emails and documents in an attempt to influence the 2024 presidential election. Eight years earlier, a Russia-linked hacking group known as Guccifer 2.0 made off with Democratic National Committee emails through a similar phishing attack; they ultimately leaked thousands of DNC emails and documents ahead of the 2016 Democratic National Convention. Under tidelike pressure from lawmakers, big tech companies have launched various efforts over the years in response to such incidents. Their efforts include meme fact checks, wishful thinking, a short-lived political ad ban, a “war room,” and collaborations with rivals and cops alike.","summary":"An attempt to influence the U.S. presidential election harnessed ChatGPT to generate stories and social media comments, per OpenAI.","url":"https://gizmodo.com/openai-chatgpt-iran-us-election-2000488246","image":"https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2024/08/chatgpt-iran-linked-election-influence-openai.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-17 21:56:30","author":"Harri Weber","authors":["Harri Weber"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.108},{"id":254343694,"title":"Harris campaign books ‘largest ever’ digital ad blitz in $200m effort to reach voters on their phones","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris’s campaign is reaching out to potential voters through cellphones and streaming platforms, reserving more than $200 million for digital advertising, a memo from the campaign announced. The Harris-Walz campaign revealed on Saturday that the investment in digital ads will take up the majority of the $370 million they have reserved for advertising – only $170 million will be geared toward television ads. For nine weeks, ads will air on popular digital platforms like Hulu, Roku, YouTube and Spotify – mainly focused in battleground states. It does not include spending on social media. The campaign said they believed it was the largest digital ad reservation in American politics. Streaming has become more popular than traditional television over the last few years. Quentin Fulks and Rob Flaherty, the deputy campaign managers for the Democratic candidates, said in their memo that they are still reserving ad spots on cable television but were being more deliberate about when those ads would air – like during high-viewership times. That includes sporting events for the NFL, WNBA, NBA, NHL and MLB as well as season premieres of The Golden Bachelorette, Wheel of Fortune, Abbott Elementary, Jeopardy and Survivor. The campaign will also place ads on daytime television on the Fox News Channel to try and reach conservative-independent voters. “Our data is clear that the hundreds of thousands of Nikki Haley voters in the battlegrounds and other conservative-leaning independents are moving towards us and we’ll be meeting them where they are,” Fulks and Flaherty said in the memo. The announcement arrives after polling from The New York Times and Sienna College show Harris rapidly catching up to the former president in Sun Belt states like Arizona, North Carolina, Nevada and Georgia.

The Republican nominee returned to X Monday for an interview with the Tesla billionaire that was riddled with technical delays and saw Trump ‘slur’, talk with a ‘lisp’ and claim that Harris looks like his wife Melania. Trump, 78, during the conversation insulted Harris several times, referring to her as ‘third rate’, ‘incompetent’ and ‘a radical left lunatic’, and expressed anger that she had been swapped in for President Joe Biden on the Democratic ticket. He also praised Russian President Vladimir Putin , Chinese President Xi Jinping and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un – all authoritarian strongmen – as at the ‘top of their game’. The Vice President’s campaign, after the interview concluded, issued a fiery response on X, mocking the pair’s technical challenges and slamming Trump for only aiming to serve ‘self-obsessed rich guys like himself’. ‘Donald Trump’s extremism and dangerous Project 2025 agenda is a feature not a glitch of his campaign, which was on full display for those unlucky enough to listen in tonight during whatever that was on X.com,’ the Harris HQ account tweeted. ‘Trump’s entire campaign is in service of people like Elon Musk and himself – self-obsessed rich guys who cannot run a livestream in the year 2024.’ Trump sat Monday for a friendly two-hour interview with the SpaceX founder on Musk’s social media platform X after technical problems delayed the start of the event for more than 40 minutes. Their chat offered Trump an unfiltered chance to air his usual mix of grievances, personal attacks and overstated or false claims. Trump took aim at Biden and Harris, blaming the pair for a rise in illegal immigration. ‘She is a San Francisco liberal who destroyed San Francisco, and then as attorney-general, she destroyed California,’ he said. ‘She’s going to be worse than him,’ he added, referencing Biden, saying the country needed to prevent anything happening under ‘stupid people like Biden’. Musk let Trump lead the conversation and did not challenge Trump’s inaccurate statements, like the assertion that other countries were sending criminals from their prisons across the southern U.S. border, or that bacon prices had risen four or five times. Studies show immigrants, including those in the U.S. illegally, do not commit crimes at a higher rate than native-born Americans. The talk was Trump’s latest effort to seize the spotlight from his Democratic rival, whose 11th-hour entry into the race has galvanized her party and boosted Democratic fundraising. Trump started by talking about last month’s assassination attempt at a campaign rally, pledging to return to the Pennsylvania town of Butler where a bullet hit his ear. ‘Doctors later told me that the ear is a place, that is a very bloody place if you’re going to get hit,’ he said. ‘If I had not turned my head, I would not be talking to you right now – as much as I like you.’ Trump also trumpeted his good relationships with Putin and Kim-Jong Un, while Musk questioned whether Harris was tough enough to stand up to overseas leaders. ‘There’s some real tough characters out there,’ he said. ‘And if they don’t think the American president is tough, they will do what they want to do.’ And although Trump insulted his rival several times, he also praised her looks. He likened the recent Time magazine cover illustration of Harris to another highly visible woman adjacent to American politics: his own wife. ‘She looks like the most beautiful actress ever to live,’ he said. ‘It was a drawing, and actually, she looked very much like a great first lady, Melania.’ Additionally, he claimed that Biden dropping off the Democratic ticket was a ‘coup’ and expressed anger over Harris’ response to the situation. ‘She hasn’t done an interview since this whole scam started,’ Trump said. Trump had been leading Biden in many polls of battleground states likely to be critical to the outcome of the Nov. 5 election, but is now trailing Harris in some of the same states. The conversation saw Musk – who has endorsed Trump in the upcoming election – and the former President exchange praise repeatedly. The Tesla chief lauded Trump for his bravery during the attempt on his life last month and Trump congratulated Musk for his willingness to fire workers demanding better conditions. ‘You’re the greatest cutter,’ Trump said. ‘I mean, I look at what you do. You walk in, you just say: ‘You want to quit?’ They go on strike – I won’t mention the name of the company – but they go on strike. And you say: ‘That’s okay, you’re all gone.” Musk, the world’s richest person, announced his support for Trump shortly after the assassination attempt against him – despite the Republican’s opposition to state support for electric carmakers like Tesla. The Tesla CEO did back Biden in 2020 but has tacked rightward since. ‘I think we’re at a fork in the road of destiny, of civilization, and I think we need to take the right path, and I think you’re the right path,’ he told Trump as the interview concluded.

The party gathers this week for the Democratic National Convention in the same city with anger simmering over another far-away war, this time in Gaza. But leaders hope to avoid the images of chaos and violence on the streets outside that derailed their chances of winning the White House in 1968. Pro-Palestinian protesters are vowing to fill the streets of the Windy City with loud demonstrations of up to 25,000 people expected to demand a ceasefire in Gaza and an end to U.S. military support for Israel. With peace talks stalled, progressive demonstrators are livid at President Biden for failing to stop the war, which has dragged on for 10 months since the Oct. 7 Hamas terror attack, or at least rein in the aggressive military stance of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In some ways, the tumult mirrors the scene in ’68, when an unpopular President Lyndon Johnson, who oversaw the escalation of the war in Vietnam, abandoned his reelection bid and Vice President Hubert Humphrey was vying to take over the mantle ahead of a fall election against Republican Richard Nixon. But there are major differences which may limit the peril for Team Blue. Kamala Harris has largely unified Democrats in just a few weeks after President Biden stepped aside and handed her the baton. The party is remarkably unified behind what many see as an existential battle to defeat former President Donald Trump. That’s a big difference from Humphrey, who faced widespread opposition within the party over his support for the war in Vietnam, which was also a much more serious issue than Gaza because American soldiers were fighting and dying on the battlefield. Humphrey was also grappling with rifts between the Democrats working-class base and youthful leftist protesters, as well as deep splits over the civil rights movement. Harris, on the other hand, says she shares protesters’ concerns about the war in Gaza and has sought to carve out a bit of distance between herself and Biden even as she mostly stands by his side. The presumptive presidential nominee has vowed to meet with members of the so-called “uncommitted” movement of pro-Palestinian Democrats who won slots as delegates on a platform of protest against Biden’s handling of the war, although she has balked at their demand for talks over cutting arms to Israel. Harris has already gotten a taste of pro-Palestinian protests as she held a round of successful rallies with her vice-presidential running mate Tim Walz. She silenced a heckler who interrupted her sprawling rally in Detroit: “If you want Trump to win, say that. Otherwise I’m speaking.” But she took a more sympathetic tack in Phoenix the next day. “The president and I are working around the clock every day to get that ceasefire deal done and bring the hostages home,” she said. “I respect your voices, but we are here to now talk about the race in 2024.” ©2024 New York Daily News.

Lt. Governor","text":"Minnesota Lieutenant Governor Peggy Flanagan warned on Saturday how significant Native American votes can be amid this year's presidential race, stating they can \"make or break\" elections.Native American voters have become increasingly recognized as a crucial voting bloc in U.S. elections, particularly in swing states like Arizona, Nevada, and Michigan. Their impact has been seen as significant in previous elections as their turnout has sometimes been the deciding factor in close races.In Arizona, Native American voters were instrumental in securing victories for Democratic candidates in both the 2020 presidential election and the 2022 midterms. Additionally, their turnout helped President Joe Biden win the state, making him the first Democrat to do so in over two decades. Similarly, in Nevada and Michigan, Native American voters have contributed to maintaining Democratic strongholds.With a tumultuous election race ahead with Vice President Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic nominee and running mate Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, expected to face off against GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump and running mate Ohio Senator JD Vance in November, key voting blocs are emerging as battleground states continue to play a key role in determining the result of this year's election.In a Saturday interview with MSNBC's The Katie Phang Show, Flanagan, who has served as Minnesota's lieutenant governor since 2019 and is the highest-ranking Native American official in the United States, discussed the importance of the Native American vote.\"I think Native people are strategically located in swing states across the country and our vote, the Native vote, can make or break a campaign or election. So, in many ways, ignore us at your peril,\" she said.Newsweek has reached out to Harris' campaign and Trump's campaign via email for comment.This comes as Harris, who made history as the first Black and South Asian person to serve as vice president, has continued to reach marginalized communities since announcing her White House bid last month following Biden's decision to step down from this year's race as she has made several campaign stops and promises to those communities.Groups such as the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), the country's oldest and largest Latino civil rights organization, endorsed Harris, the first time in the group's nearly 100-year history that it has thrown its formal backing behind a presidential candidate. While a group called South Asian Women for Harris organized a call that more than 4,000 women joined.Trump has also continued to make efforts to reach Black voters including several campaign stops in predominantly Black communities, calling into the Black American Business Leader Barbershop Roundtable at a barbershop in Atlanta, and most recently attending a Q&A session at this year's National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) convention.Flanagan said on Saturday that Native Americans face significant challenges with voting suppression, including issues with voter ID laws, transportation to polling sites, and inadequate voter engagement from political parties.\"There are several folks who have tried to throw obstacles to Native participation by suddenly deciding that tribal ID's are no longer a valid form of identification, saying that you need to have a physical address and not a PO box when in so many reservations communities that's not how people live,\" she said.The lieutenant governor added: \"It is very clear that there is only one team that is interested in making sure that everyone has access to the ballot box and the freedom to vote, and that is Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.\"According to the Native American Voter Rights Fund, only 66 percent of the known eligible Native American voting population is registered to vote. There are over 1 million eligible Native American voters in the U.S. who are not registered.Newsweek has reached out to the Native American Voter Rights Fund via email for comment.These challenges have led to efforts to pass the Native American Voting Rights Act, which aims to reduce these barriers, although it has not yet been enacted into law.Flanagan, who would become the country's first Indigenous governor and Minnesota's first woman governor if Walz is elected as vice president in November with Harris, has continued to make her own efforts in the state including the integration of tribal consultation into state governance, the establishment of one of the first state offices dedicated to Missing and Murdered Indigenous Relatives, and strengthened protections for Native children in adoption processes.","summary":"\"In many ways, ignore us at your peril,\" Peggy Flanagan said on Saturday during an interview on MSNBC.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/native-american-votes-can-make-break-elections-peggy-flanagan-1940731","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2452196/peggy-flanagan.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-17 21:38:31","author":"Natalie Venegas","authors":["Natalie Venegas"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.163},{"id":254341452,"title":"Chicago hopes DNC will provide millions in tourism revenue despite tight security","text":"Aug. 17 (UPI) -- Despite extensive security precautions and traffic restrictions, Chicago's tourism industry is aiming to capitalize to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars during next week's Democratic National Convention. City officials say the event is expected to attract more than 50,000 attendees, including 5,000 members of the media, 5,000 delegates and alternates, and other visitors. The DNC's event schedule concentrates on two venues -- the United Center, a 20,000-seat sports arena on the city's near West Side, and McCormick Place, a sprawling event center along Lake Michigan south of the central business district known as The Loop. Night-time events, including major speeches, will take place at the United Center. Events at McCormick Place, including briefing and speeches by some politicians, will take place from 9 a.m. to 4:45 p.m. Security perimeters will be erected around the two sites beginning Sunday. Fifteen-foot buffers around the entire security perimeters of the United Center and McCormick Place will be in place until 12:01 a.m. CDT on Aug. 26, according to the Chicago Police Department.

Meanwhile, full street closures were instituted late Friday around McCormick Place and on Saturday at the United Center. The likelihood of large-scale demonstrations spreading beyond officially designated \"protest zones\" in Union Park and \"Park 578,\" located a few blocks north of the United Center, also weighed on the minds of visitors to the city. The expected demonstrators include pro-Palestinian supporters calling on the Democratic Party to help end the ongoing conflict in Gaza. Chicago tourism officials, however, remained upbeat about the potential of an economic impact in the neighborhood of $150 million from the DNC.

So its presidential election show was a quadrennial tradition from 1964 to 2016, before COVID scuttled it in 2020. But Brave New Workshop is tapping into the current electoral zeitgeist again with “No Country for Two Old Men.” And, seeing as thinking on your feet is an essential part of the troupe’s improvisational training, it’s appropriate that the past month’s events have forced the team of writer/performers to revise and revise again. For example, that title may have seemed obsolete when President Joe Biden dropped his re-election bid. But it works in the context of the opening song, a recap of the campaign thus far that allows audiences to laugh at events that may have seemed too worrisome at the time. The show is a landslide winner in the political comedy category. “No Country for Two Old Men” is the funniest thing the company’s concocted since before the pandemic, a high-energy collection of skits and songs that tosses caution overboard and could be the ideal antidote for news-infected gloominess. While TV viewers speculate about who’s going to play Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on “Saturday Night Live,” it bears remembering that that show was made possible by pioneers like Brave New Workshop and such kindred contemporaries as Chicago’s Second City and Los Angeles’ Groundlings. And please note that it’s far more thrilling to experience this kind of comedy up close in an intimate space like the theater that now bears the name of company founder Dudley Riggs. Not only that, but the writing’s often much better and more slickly delivered than on “SNL.” Even if you think that you’d rather escape political discussions altogether, perhaps what you need is an opportunity to laugh about all that’s happened in recent months. If you witnessed Biden’s decline with heart-sinking sadness, check out the hilarious version of him offered by new addition Jeffrey Nolan, who brings smiles as he mumbles raspily about “histrionic achievements” and “exploding health care.” Or enjoy the campaign advice offered by Doug Neithercott’s “Pander Bear,” who oversees the dumbing down of candidate Lauren Anderson’s stump speech. And witness divisiveness in action in a game of “Black or Woman” or its dance-pop antidote, Isabella Dunsieth’s Madonna-esque “Ethnically Ambiguous.” Granted, the material isn’t consistently strong. Denzel Belin’s burlesque-style profession of lust for old white male politicians and a brief tutorial on “Project 2025” lack the cleverness or bite of the bits around them. But bite is preponderant in most of this revue, and what a welcome return that is after a few years of post-pandemic carefulness. Directed with briskness and punch by Brave New Workshop’s artistic director, Caleb McEwen, it bears echoes of the delightfully snarling shows he created early this century in tandem with wife Katy McEwen. While some may complain that “No Country for Two Old Men” isn’t an equal-opportunity offender, it will likely evolve to include more campaigning critiques for Kamala Harris and Walz. And our governor does make a cameo courtesy of Neithercott. Given a little more time, his imitation might rival his spot-on Donald Trump. Brave New Workshop’s ‘No Country for Two Old Men’ When: Through Nov. 2 Where: Dudley Riggs Theatre, 824 Hennepin Ave., Minneapolis Tickets: $40-$32, available at bravenewworkshop.org Capsule: The bite is back at Brave New Workshop.","summary":"While TV viewers speculate about who’s going to play Minnesota Gov.

The reality is that the US is already dominant, which is expected to produce 13.2 million barrels of oil per day on average this year – millions of barrels more than Saudi Arabia or Russia, according to the report. Biden’s signature 2022 climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act, has also helped boost production of solar, wind and other forms of renewable energy, but he has struggled to significantly wean the US economy from fossil fuels because of legal obligations, political challenges and market demand, said the report. “The prospect of high gas prices is a political nightmare that haunts all presidents, and Biden is no exception. Each time gas prices have shot upward, Biden has taken steps to relieve the pain at the pump – even if those steps were seemingly in conflict with his climate goals,” it said.","summary":"","url":"https://borneobulletin.com.bn/us-crude-oil-output-keeps-rising-under-democratic-republican-administrations/","image":"https://borneobulletin.com.bn/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/P11-D_18082024.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-17 21:01:41","author":null,"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"bn","sentiment":-0.188},{"id":254341416,"title":"‘Things I Trust More Than Donald Trump’ List Goes Viral: ‘Dinner with Jeffrey Dahmer’","text":"A viral list called “Things I Trust More Than Trump” is taking on a life of its own online after The View co-host Anna Navarro posted it to her Instagram account on Saturday. Navarro, an outspoken Donald Trump critic, posted a photo of what appears to be a banner with an itemized list counting up to 10 suggested “things” they trust more than the former president. Navarro encouraged her followers to add on to the list in her comments, and the photo racked up more than 50K likes. Listed as No. 1 on the list was “Flint, Michigan tap water” followed by “gas station sushi” and then “Bill Cosby as a bartender” at No. 3. Listed at No. 9 was a “a Casey Anthony daycare” and “a fart when I have diarrhea” at No. 10. Navarro added seven additional “things” she trusts more than Trump in her caption, writing “a movie-role from Harvey Weinstein” and “JD Vance alone on my living room couch.” Navarro’s followers continued with their own list of things. “A time share at Chernobyl,” added one social media commentator. “A deep water excursion operated by OceanGate,” added another. “Steve Harvey calling me the miss America winner, another added, referencing Harvey’s infamous gaffe. At the bottom of the list in the photo appears to be a logo in support of Kamala Harris for president. Her camp did not respond for a request for comment in time of publication.","summary":"Photo Illustration by Erin O’Flynn/The Daily Beast/Getty Images and ananavarrofl/InstagramA viral list called “Things I Trust More Than Trump” is taking on a life of its own online after The View co-host Anna Navarro posted it to her Instagram account on Saturday.\n\nNavarro, an outspoken Donald Trump critic, posted a photo of what appears to be a banner with an itemized list counting up to 10 suggested “things” they trust more than the former president. \n\nNavarro encouraged her followers to add on to the list in her comments, and the photo racked up more than 50K likes.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.","url":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-view-co-host-anna-navarro-posts-things-i-trust-more-than-donald-trump-list","image":"https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_900,w_1600,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1723927251/280717-trust-donald-trump-sign-hero_q1atof","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-17 20:59:55","author":"Emell Derra Adolphus","authors":["Emell Derra Adolphus"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.231},{"id":254345150,"title":"Trump scares his followers with talk of \"illegals,\" but border crossings are lowest in four years","text":"During Donald Trump's press conference at his Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey on Thursday, he pivoted from speaking points meant to focus on inflation to, once again, rattle off misinformation about Kamala Harris wanting to \"end detention of illegal alien migrants, releasing vicious monsters into our communities to rape, maim and murder.\" And this has been a popular loop-de-doop of his for years, regardless of who his opponent is. But it's usually not based on facts by any stretch of the word. Having made a habit out of scaring his followers with talk of \"illegals,\" with several MAGA enthusiasts stumbling into the subject as recently as today speaking to press just before his rally in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, it would be interesting to hear his response to a new tally from border agents revealing this fake news of crossings to be at their lowest in four years. In a Friday afternoon feature by The Washington Post breaking down the decline in illegal border crossings, they highlight data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection showing \"56,408 illegal crossings in July, a 32 percent decline from June and the fifth straight month that the figure has fallen,\" with officials attributing the change \"to executive actions Biden announced this spring that effectively shut off access to the U.S. asylum system for migrants who enter illegally.\" “The Biden-Harris Administration has taken effective action, and Republicans continue to do nothing,” White House spokesperson Angelo Fernández Hernández said in a statement on the numbers, adding that Republican lawmakers “are more interested in cynically playing politics than securing the border.”","summary":"A new tally by border agents shows that illegal crossings are at a steady decline, down 32 percent since June","url":"https://www.salon.com/2024/08/17/scares-his-followers-with-talk-of-illegals-but-border-crossings-are-lowest-in-four-years/","image":"https://mediaproxy.salon.com/width/1200/height/675/<?= https://media2.salon.com/2024/08/trump-rally-2167181308jpg.jpg ?>","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-17 20:54:38","author":"Kelly McClure","authors":["Kelly McClure"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.142},{"id":254340816,"title":"Harris campaign reserves $370 mil in ads after Labor Day, including battleground state push","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris ' campaign says it is reserving $370 million in advertising to run between Labor Day and Election Day. In a memo Saturday, the Harris-Walz campaign said the fall advertising push will include $170 million in television reservations running for nine weeks, starting Sept. 3, in battleground states. It also includes more than $200 million in digital reservations on platforms such as Hulu, Roku and YouTube. That does not include spending on ads on social media or search services. Former President Donald Trump 's campaign has only reserved advertising time after Labor Day in two states, the battlegrounds of Pennsylvania and Georgia, according to data from the media tracking firm AdImpact. Quentin Fulks and Rob Flaherty, deputy campaign manager for the Democratic candidates, said in their memo that the television ads they were reserving included spots around high-viewership moments such as major sporting events and season premieres. It also included daytime reservations on Fox News Channel, where the campaign believes they can reach an audience of conservative-leaning independents who had supported former GOP presidential candidate Nikki Haley over Trump in the Republican presidential primary. Ad reservations can allow candidates and campaigns to lock in rates before they go up as dates come closer. © Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
