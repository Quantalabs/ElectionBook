The 90-minute debate, scheduled for 9 p.m. Eastern on Tuesday in a Manhattan studio that once hosted the children’s program “Captain Kangaroo,” will be moderated by the outgoing “CBS Evening News” anchor Norah O’Donnell and “Face the Nation” host Margaret Brennan. During ABC’s debate between presidential contenders Kamala Harris and Donald Trump earlier this month, network moderators on four occasions pointed out inaccurate statements by Trump, and none by Harris. That infuriated the former president and his supporters, who complained it was unfair. Last spring, CNN moderators did not question any facts presented by Trump and President Biden in the debate where Biden’s poor performance eventually led to him dropping out of the race. On Friday, CBS said the onus will be on Vance and Walz to point out misstatements by the other, and that “the moderators will facilitate those opportunities” during rebuttal time. The network said its own misinformation unit, CBS News Confirmed, will provide real-time fact-checking during the debate on its live blog and on social media, and on the air during post-debate analysis. With its plans, CBS News is clearly indicating it wants to take a step back from the heat generated by calling attention to misleading statements by candidates. Some argue that offstage fact-checking is too little, too late and not seen by many people who watch the event. It’s not the first time Angie Drodnic Holan, director of the international fact-checking network at the Poynter Institute, said she has seen examples of moderators who have successfully encouraged candidates to keep their opponents honest. “I’ll be interested in seeing how this works in practice,” she said. “Having said that, you’re basically off-loading one of your journalistic responsibilities onto the candidates themselves, so I don’t think that it’s ideal. It takes journalistic courage to be willing to fact-check the candidates, because the candidates are absolutely going to complain about it. I don’t think the moderators’ first goal is to avoid controversy.” During the ABC debate, moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis corrected Trump statements on abortion, the 2020 election, crime statistics and reports that immigrants in Ohio were eating pets. Unlike the two presidential debates, the two sides agreed that the vice presidential candidates’ microphones will not be turned off while their opponent is speaking, increasing the chance for genuine back-and-forth exchanges and the risk that the two men will talk over each other. CBS says it reserves the right to shut off a “hot mic” when necessary. Each candidate will have two minutes for a closing statement, with Vance winning a virtual coin toss and choosing to get the last word. The stakes are high for CBS News It’s a big moment for CBS News, long mired in third place in the evening news ratings. O’Donnell just announced she was stepping down from the role. Brennan is considered a rising star. Like with the presidential debates, CBS is making its feed available for other networks to televise, and many are expected to take advantage of the opportunity. There will be no audience when Vance and Walz meet at a West Side studio that, in its past, has hosted editions of “60 Minutes,” “CBS Sunday Morning,” “Inside the NFL,” “Geraldo” and “Captain Kangaroo.” It’s not known whether there will be other opportunities to see Trump and Harris together on the same stage before the Nov. 5 election. Harris has accepted an invitation from CNN for another debate on Oct. 23, but Trump has rejected it. In a poll taken by Quinnipiac University and released earlier this week, likely voters said by roughly a two-to-one margin that they’d like them face off again. CBS’ “60 Minutes” is looking to land both Harris and Trump for back-to-back interviews that will air on Oct. 7, but neither candidate has committed to it yet.","summary":"With its plans, CBS News is clearly indicating it wants to take a step back from the heat generated by calling attention to misleading statements by candidates.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/27/media/cbs-news-says-vance-walz-will-have-to-fact-check-each-other-in-vp-debate/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/cbs-vp-debate.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1727464203&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/1HSoAkCv-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-28 00:56:23","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.131},{"id":257695958,"title":"Ukraine war: US Sec. of State Blinken questions China peace push over Russia help","text":"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday questioned China’s sincerity in seeking peace in Ukraine as he directly pressed his counterpart over exports that boost Russia’s military. Blinken met Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, the latest talks as the two powers look to dial down once-soaring tensions. While crediting the diplomacy with bringing progress, Blinken warned that the United States would not back down on concerns over China’s exports to Russia and made clear that Washington could impose more sanctions. Blinken said that China is fueling the “war machine” of Russian President Vladimir Putin. “When Beijing says that, on the one hand, that it wants peace, it wants to see an end to the conflict, but on the other hand is allowing its companies to take actions that are actually helping Putin continue the aggression, that doesn’t add up,” Blinken told a news conference. “Our intent is not to decouple Russia from China. Their relationship is their business,” he said. “But insofar as that relationship involves providing Russia what it needs to continue this war, that’s a problem for us, and it’s a problem for many other countries, notably in Europe,” Blinken added. The top US diplomat said that China has provided 70 percent of machine tools and 90 percent of microelectronics needed by Russia for military production that includes rockets and armored vehicles. China counters that it has not directly provided weapons to Russia and draws a contrast with the United States, which has shipped billions of dollars in weapons to Ukraine since the 2022 invasion by Russia. Wang told a Security Council session on Tuesday that China “is not a creator of the Ukraine crisis, nor are we a party to it. China has all along stood on the side of peace.” Keeping up peace push Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a UN address criticized China and Brazil for promoting negotiations to end the war, saying that forcing Ukraine to accept a peace deal was akin to colonialism. The two countries kept up the drive on Friday, leading a statement with other emerging powers that calls for a “comprehensive and lasting settlement” through diplomacy. But in a thinly veiled criticism of Putin’s recent saber-rattling, the emerging powers called on all sides to refrain “from the use or the threat of weapons of mass destruction.” South Africa and Turkey were among the powers that also signed the statement. Putin this week threatened to use nuclear weapons in the event of a major attack on Russian soil as Ukraine, looking to hit back against the invasion, seeks Western weapons to strike deeper across the border. Fruits of diplomacy Since Blinken and Wang last met in July at a regional conference in Laos, China has pleased the United States by releasing an American pastor imprisoned for years, although other Americans are detained. Chinese President Xi Jinping, during a summit in November 2023 with counterpart Joe Biden, agreed to key US demands of restoring military communication between the two powers. He also agreed to taking action against producers of ingredients in fentanyl, the painkiller behind an overdose epidemic in the United States. But a wide range of disagreements remain. Blinken said he also warned Wang against Beijing’s “dangerous, destabilizing actions” on the South China Sea, where tensions have risen sharply between China and US ally the Philippines. The latest meeting came ahead of the November 5 election in which Republican candidate Donald Trump has vowed to take a harder line on China. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, who is running against Trump, have said that they seek dialogue to avoid conflict between the two powers, although their administration has also taken a hard line. Blinken’s deputy, Kurt Campbell, recently told a congressional hearing that China posed a broader challenge to the United States than the Soviet Union did during the Cold War.

Harris, a Democrat, arrived in Douglas, Arizona, a border town of less than 17,000 people, on Friday afternoon with a message ripped from Trump's playbook, hoping to convince voters that she can curb the numbers of people illegally entering the United States. Harris will call for tighter asylum restrictions in a speech later on Friday, her campaign said, leaving an asylum ban established by President Joe Biden in place longer and lowering the threshold at which it is activated. Some 7 million migrants have been arrested illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border under Harris and Biden, according to government data, a record high number that has fueled criticism from Trump. Those border crossings have dropped sharply since Biden announced the asylum ban earlier this year. In Douglas, Harris spoke to Customs and Border Protection officials and viewed part of a border barrier constructed between 2011 and 2012, the White House said. Trump and his running mate JD Vance have increased their criticism of immigrants in recent weeks, repeating falsehoods about legal Haitian immigrants in Ohio and suggesting immigrants were committing crimes and stealing jobs. Immigration is a top issue for voters. Arizona is a closely contested election state, with a high population of Latino voters sought by both parties. And the nation's porous southern border remains a source of fentanyl, a leading cause of drug overdoses in the United States. On Friday, Trump blamed Harris for the rising trend of irregular migration. \"The architect of this destruction is Kamala Harris,\" Trump said at Trump Tower. \"She keeps talking about how she supposedly wants to fix the border. We would merely ask, why didn't she do it four years ago? It's a very simple question.\" He also accused Harris of turning small towns in the U.S. into \"blighted refugee camps.\" A wide-ranging border security bill that took months to negotiate was blocked by the U.S. Senate in February, after Trump pressed Republicans to reject any compromise. A Reuters/Ipsos poll last month found that 43% of voters favored Trump on the issue of immigration and 33% favored Harris, while 24% either didn't know, chose someone else or refused to answer. Harris was California's attorney general before being elected to the U.S. Senate and then vice president. Her California remit included targeting gangs that operate on both sides of the border and traffic in drugs, guns and people. Biden also tasked Harris with dealing with the root causes of migration from Central America, a diplomatic issue on which her record is mixed. Emigration from Latin America, the Caribbean and Asia to the United States has created unease among voters concerned about what the trend means for the U.S. economy, crime rates and culture. The share of American residents born abroad rose by nearly a fifth to 47.8 million from 2010 to 2023, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. © Thomson Reuters 2024.","summary":"Vice President Kamala Harris visited the U.S.-Mexico border for the first time in her 2024 presidential campaign on Friday as her Republican opponent Donald Trump doubles down on…","url":"https://japantoday.com/category/world/harris-to-call-for-tighter-immigration-controls-in-border-visit","image":"https://japantoday-asset.scdn3.secure.raxcdn.com/img/store/37/d2/01e0455cfc9f724368fc66f0712be7f37dba/tagreuters/_w1700.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-28 00:33:19","author":"Japan Today Editor,Trevor Hunnicutt","authors":["Japan Today Editor","Trevor Hunnicutt"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"jp","sentiment":-0.075},{"id":257695634,"title":"Face it, Trump is a communist","text":"Recently, Donald Trump had this to say about Kamala Harris: “She's a Marxist, communist, fascist, socialist.” On the one hand, this isn’t worth taking seriously. After all, he’s putting everything he has mentally into stringing together words, any words, in the hope of scamming us into believing his lies. Whether it’s “Marxist, communist, fascist, socialist” or “person, woman, man, camera, TV,” it’s all kinda the same to the delusional and demented. On the other hand, we should take this seriously. I don’t mean asking whether Harris is a “Marxist, communist, fascist, socialist.” She isn’t. I mean asking whether Trump is. Most of us understand why he’s a fascist. Too few of us understand why he’s a communist. In any conventional sense of the word, that’s what he is. And economics can have nothing to do with it. Just ask Ana Navarro, a former Republican who fled communist Nicaragua. At the Democratic National Convention, she said: \"Trump and his minions call Kamala a communist. I know communism. I fled communism from Nicaragua when I was 8 years old. I don’t take it lightly. And let me tell you what communist dictators do. … \"They attack the free press. They call them the enemy of the people, like Ortega does in Nicaragua. They put their unqualified relatives in cushy government jobs, so they can get rich off their positions, like the Castros do in Cuba. And they refuse to accept legitimate elections when they lose and call for violence to stay in power, like Maduro is doing right now in Venezuela. \"Now you tell me something. Do any of those things sound familiar? Is there anybody running for president who reminds you of that?\" That’s about power, but economics plays a role, too. History is filled with communist dictators who enacted economic agendas not because their policies were based on sound principles and solid data but because they served an immediate political interest. The outcome was sometimes the ruination of their country’s populations. Trump wants to decimate the labor supply by deporting 20 million “illegal immigrants.” He wants to impose an across-the-board tariff of 20 percent and more on all imported goods. And he wants to seize control of the Federal Reserve Bank’s power to set interest rates. A new report by the Peterson Institute, a very conservative think tank in Washington, found that these economic policies would “not only fail to solve inflation – they would make it much worse,” according to CNN. They would moreover depress growth, spike inflation and wipe out jobs to such a degree that the carnage would be felt well into 2040. “We find that ironically, despite his ‘make the foreigners pay’ rhetoric, this package of policies does more damage to the US economy than to any other in the world,” the Peterson Institute’s working paper said. This is not news. Anyone who knows anything about economics knows indiscriminate tariffs would help no one while harming everyone. Yet he keeps talking about them as if he cares about their real-world consequences. He doesn’t. He only cares about whether they work for him politically. In that, he’s just like a communist dictator. But there’s more to being a communist than power and economics. There’s character, too, or lack of it. The most important thing to Donald Trump is whether you like him. If you do, you’re good. If you don’t, you’re bad. It doesn’t matter that you once called yourself a “Black Nazi.” It doesn’t matter that you once said you would like slavery to return so you can own a few slaves. It doesn't matter that you once said you liked “tranny porn” and that you fantasize about peeping on women in public gyms. You can do all the things that North Carolina gubernatorial candidate Mark Robinson has reportedly done and it won’t matter to Trump. But Robinson likes him. So he endorsed Robinson. Former North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory warned for years that Robinson was a “ticking time bomb.” He told CNN that even the quickest glance at his record would reveal things that are disqualifying. But McCrory is one of those RINOs (Republicans in name only). His warnings went nowhere, because if you don’t like Trump, he doesn’t like you. Due to the scandal surrounding Robinson, Trump might lose North Carolina. But defeat won’t be his fault. It will be McCrory’s. Such are the hallmarks of communist dictator. To be sure, my argument is a hard sell. Reasonable people may buy the idea that Donald Trump is a fascist, but not that he’s a communist. After all, he’s a billionaire. He’s on the side of the billionaire class. How can he be a communist? But reasonable people are overthinking it. Trump isn’t defending capitalism. He’s defending white power. If you prefer, he’s going to war against the enemies of the white collective. He’s prepared to use every instrument of the state toward that end. Reducing the labor supply (deportations), increasing taxes (tariffs) and seizing the power to set interest rates will hurt the country generally. But they will hurt nonwhite people more than white people. It would be a race to the bottom for everyone except the richest of Americans. But Trump wouldn’t be to blame. He’d find someone outside the white collective to accuse. Just like a communist.","summary":"Recently, Donald Trump had this to say about Kamala Harris: \n\n“She's a Marxist, communist, fascist, socialist.”\n\nOn the one hand, this isn’t worth taking seriously.

General Assembly and to meet with U.S. officials, interjected to note that he hopes he and Trump “have more good relations,” compared with Putin. Trump replied that it “takes two to tango.” Trump has been highly critical of U.S. funding to Ukraine and, at times, Zelenskyy — an uneasy relationship that was made even less comfortable after the Ukrainian president visited an ammunition plant in battleground state of Pennsylvania. House Speaker Mike Johnson called on Zelenskyy to fire his ambassador to the U.S., Oksana Markarova, over the Pennsylvania trip, which did not include any Republican officials. Zelenskyy has in turn been critical of Trump, saying the former U.S. president “doesn’t really know how to stop the war.” Trump frequently says Russia “would have never attacked Ukraine” if he was president. After the meeting, Trump told Fox News that he “learned a lot” from his sitdown with the Ukrainian leader. “I think I haven’t changed from the standpoint, we both want to see it end and a fair deal made. It has to be fair. I think it will happen at the right time. I think it is going to happen,” Trump said. “The president wants it to end as quickly as possible. He wants a fair transaction to take place.” “Putin killed so many people and, of course, we need to do everything to pressure him to stop this war,” Zelenskyy said. “He is in our territory. That’s the most important. He is in our territory and how to stop the war, to pressure him as we can, we have to do it.” In a post on Truth Social later Friday, Trump wrote that the pair had a “great meeting.” “If I’m elected President, the war with Russia and Ukraine will end quickly. If not, that war will never end, and will phase into WORLD WAR III,” Trump said. Trump has frequently claimed that he would be able to end the war in Ukraine quickly, in as little as “a day.” CBS News’ Caitlin Huey-Burns asked him what an end to the fighting would look like. “I don’t want to tell you what that looks like,” he responded. He said of Ukraine that Russian leader Vladimir Putin “told me often it’s the apple of his eye.” Trump claimed he warned against invading Ukraine and said, “‘Vladimir, don’t even think about doing it.'” On Thursday, Trump told reporters “I believe I can work that out.” Asked whether Ukraine should cede land to Russia to end the war, Trump did not answer directly. “Let’s get some peace,” he said. “We need peace. We need to stop the death and destruction. Don’t you think? Wouldn’t that be nice?” Earlier in the day, Trump posted to his social media platform, Truth Social, a message purportedly from Zelenskyy requesting a face-to-face meeting with Trump while Zelenskyy would already be in New York. Trump’s announcement that he would meet with Zelenskyy came shortly after that post. Zelenskyy was in Washington on Thursday for meetings with top members of Congress, as well as President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. A national security spokesperson for Harris’ campaign said in a statement, “The only Ukraine deal Trump wants is one that benefits Putin, not Ukraine. “ contributed to this report.","summary":"Washington — Former President Donald Trump met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at Trump Tower in New York on Friday morning, where the GOP nominee vowed to bring a quick end to the war between Russia and Ukraine if he captures the White House. &#8220;We have a very good relationship, and I also have a &#8230;\n\n\nThe post Trump meets with Zelenskyy in New York, vowing to resolve Ukraine war appeared first on WorldNewsEra.","url":"https://worldnewsera.com/news/politics/trump-meets-with-zelenskyy-in-new-york-vowing-to-resolve-ukraine-war/","image":"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/09/27/47721db0-ab12-4a5b-89f3-eec2ace25e90/thumbnail/1200x630g2/c738c44434ba084b82194a550ce4f39b/gettyimages-2173922474.jpg?v=fa529222a2be3543711c1a879b51e860","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-28 00:28:01","author":"Cathy Biank","authors":["Cathy Biank"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.291},{"id":257695896,"title":"Oasis 'are in talks to record a live album of their upcoming sell-out gigs - meaning fans who missed out on tickets will still get to hear the shows'","text":"Home News Royals U.S. Sport TV Showbiz Femail Health Science Money Travel Podcasts Shopping Best Buys Discounts My Profile Logout Login Headlines Showbiz Kim Kardashian Victoria Beckham Harry Styles Amanda Holden Britain's Got Talent My Profile Logout Login Privacy Policy Feedback Saturday, Sep 28th 2024 1AM 9°C 4AM 8°C 5-Day Forecast Advertisement The moment Netanyahu pushed the button: How Israeli PM 'tricked' Hezbollah by flying to US before authorising IDF to launch airstrikes to 'kill' terror group's leaders - leaving Beirut in ruins and the Middle East on the brink of 'all-out war' Shortly after this picture was taken, this mother-of-two stepped inside the 'suicide pod' - and waited for a robotic voice to tell her...

Email freya.barnes@mailonline.co.uk By Freya Barnes Published:00:43 BST, 28 September 2024 |Updated:01:01 BST, 28 September 2024 e-mail 1 View comments A warning has been issued over the so-called 'miracle' fat-busting jabs Ozempic and Wegovy after they caused 3,000 Brits to fall ill this year so far. The most common symptom was stomach problems but some also experienced blurred vision, depression and dizziness. Four deaths have also been linked to the drugs. Around 30 side effect complaints were sent to The Medicines and Healthcare Agency every week during 2023. In the first 20 weeks of this year, there has been a big spike in side effect complaints under the agency's Yellow Card scheme which lets patients and health experts submit reports of bad reactions to drugs. The agency has received 2,780 complaints since the year started, figures obtained by The Sun reveal. The rise is attributed to the growing popularity of the drugs for weight loss purposes and how readily available it is to buy online.

Four deaths have also been linked to the drugs (file photo) Model and half-sister to Kate Moss, Lottie Moss, 26, had a seizure from taking a high dose and Stephen Fry, 67, had to stop taking the drug due to vomiting. Other stars have rejected the idea of the drug, including chef Nigella Lawson who told The New York Time: 'I read something once where someone said, \"I was on Ozempic and it was the first time I didn’t think about food all the time,\" and I thought, I can’t imagine anything worse than that. I take great pleasure in thinking about food all of the time.' Read More Ozempic really IS life-saving, slashing risk of death from ALL CAUSES by a quarter, new data shows The drugs contain semaglutide, an amino acid, which suppresses appetite by mimicking a hormone telling the brain you are full up. The jabs were approved by the NHS last year and is called Wegovy for overweight people taking it to lose fat. It is referred to as Ozempic for those who suffer with Type 2 diabetes. Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, told The Sun: 'For some, the benefits of semaglutide may well outweigh its risks but the drug has side effects. 'It's why doctors and GPs should always monitor anyone taking it for weight loss and the jabs should never be taken without a prescription. 'An inclination to suicide is a potential risk: that should stop anyone thinking of using the drug off-licence.' Manufacturer of the drugs, Novo Nordisk, said: 'We recommend patients take these medications for approved indications and under the supervision of a healthcare professional.' It comes after new data last month showed that semaglutide can slash the risk of deaths from all causes by up to a quarter. Model and half-sister to Kate Moss, Lottie Moss, 26, had a seizure from taking a high dose of Stephen Fry, 67, had to stop taking the weight loss drug due to vomiting Researchers from Harvard Medical School in the US showed obese and overweight people on semaglutide enjoyed a 23 per cent lower chance of dying overall in the three years that followed. Meanwhile a separate study led by Australian researchers showed diabetes patients on the drug for just two months had a 29 per cent lower chance of death from heart attacks and strokes. The studies are the latest to demonstrate that the fat-busting jabs have a protective effect, but scientists are still unable to pinpoint exactly why. While the jabs can help patients lose weight and improve their health in general experts say this doesn't fully explain the slash in risk of early death.

Email freya.barnes@mailonline.co.uk By Freya Barnes Published:00:43 BST, 28 September 2024 |Updated:01:01 BST, 28 September 2024 e-mail 1 View comments A warning has been issued over the so-called 'miracle' fat-busting jabs Ozempic and Wegovy after they caused 3,000 Brits to fall ill this year so far. The most common symptom was stomach problems but some also experienced blurred vision, depression and dizziness. Four deaths have also been linked to the drugs. Around 30 side effect complaints were sent to The Medicines and Healthcare Agency every week during 2023. In the first 20 weeks of this year, there has been a big spike in side effect complaints under the agency's Yellow Card scheme which lets patients and health experts submit reports of bad reactions to drugs. The agency has received 2,780 complaints since the year started, figures obtained by The Sun reveal. The rise is attributed to the growing popularity of the drugs for weight loss purposes and how readily available it is to buy online.

Four deaths have also been linked to the drugs (file photo) Model and half-sister to Kate Moss, Lottie Moss, 26, had a seizure from taking a high dose and Stephen Fry, 67, had to stop taking the drug due to vomiting. Other stars have rejected the idea of the drug, including chef Nigella Lawson who told The New York Time: 'I read something once where someone said, \"I was on Ozempic and it was the first time I didn’t think about food all the time,\" and I thought, I can’t imagine anything worse than that. I take great pleasure in thinking about food all of the time.' Read More Ozempic really IS life-saving, slashing risk of death from ALL CAUSES by a quarter, new data shows The drugs contain semaglutide, an amino acid, which suppresses appetite by mimicking a hormone telling the brain you are full up. The jabs were approved by the NHS last year and is called Wegovy for overweight people taking it to lose fat. It is referred to as Ozempic for those who suffer with Type 2 diabetes. Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, told The Sun: 'For some, the benefits of semaglutide may well outweigh its risks but the drug has side effects. 'It's why doctors and GPs should always monitor anyone taking it for weight loss and the jabs should never be taken without a prescription. 'An inclination to suicide is a potential risk: that should stop anyone thinking of using the drug off-licence.' Manufacturer of the drugs, Novo Nordisk, said: 'We recommend patients take these medications for approved indications and under the supervision of a healthcare professional.' It comes after new data last month showed that semaglutide can slash the risk of deaths from all causes by up to a quarter. Model and half-sister to Kate Moss, Lottie Moss, 26, had a seizure from taking a high dose of Stephen Fry, 67, had to stop taking the weight loss drug due to vomiting Researchers from Harvard Medical School in the US showed obese and overweight people on semaglutide enjoyed a 23 per cent lower chance of dying overall in the three years that followed. Meanwhile a separate study led by Australian researchers showed diabetes patients on the drug for just two months had a 29 per cent lower chance of death from heart attacks and strokes. The studies are the latest to demonstrate that the fat-busting jabs have a protective effect, but scientists are still unable to pinpoint exactly why. While the jabs can help patients lose weight and improve their health in general experts say this doesn't fully explain the slash in risk of early death.

It is the first thing some sore losers have turned to after losing a presidential election. In 2016, you may recall, many Democrats took solace or vented their frustration by pointing out that “Hillary Clinton won the popular vote.” These complaints were almost always followed closely by demands that the Electoral College be eliminated. It was and still is often said that unless the Electoral College is scrapped, we don’t really have a democracy. This is increasingly so as the Democratic Party exiles itself to urban areas. The party can run up individual vote totals in large Democratic cities while doing nothing to increase its chances of Electoral College votes from swing states that don’t have a Los Angeles or New York City to produce a lopsided score. Enter the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact. This is a plan of dubious constitutionality to undermine the electoral system. It would make elections less safe and even more partisan than they already are if you can imagine that. The compact consists of states tying their votes in the Electoral College to the national popular vote total. It means that each state in the compact would award its electoral votes to the candidate with the most votes in the country, even if that candidate lost in that state. At present, 17 states and the District of Columbia have tied their 209 electoral votes to the national popular vote, getting closer to the 270 electoral votes needed for a candidate to become president. The compact is popular only with Democrats, which makes sense because the party often wins the popular vote even when it loses the presidency. Democrats enthusiastic to tie their state’s Electoral College votes to the popular vote assume this will help Democrats, as indeed it would in current circumstances. But it is utterly devoid of principle. There is a useful thought experiment one can force upon Democrats when they tout the “democratic” principle of the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact. All you need to do is ask them this: “So let’s say your state voted for Kamala Harris, but Donald Trump won the popular vote, you’d be content that your state’s Electoral College votes would be cast for Trump, right?” This usually produces a certain amount of stuttering and foot shuffling and the circumstantial but unprincipled retort, “But that’s not likely to happen.” The compact fundamentally contradicts what America is supposed to be. We are the “United States,” or are supposed to be, which implies including all those participating in the federal system, not excluding those with whom one disagrees. The states make up the country. The nation does not have the right to treat smaller states as subservient departments. The loss of this concept of genuine federalism is why the federal government has become more intrusive in everyday life, as voters and the parties, especially the Democratic Party, expect the president to absorb responsibilities that should fall to state governments. The national popular vote idea is thus a “solution” to a problem that doesn’t exist. The system works as it is because it forces presidential candidates to make appeals to broad swaths of the country. Trump lost the popular vote but won 30 of the 50 states in 2016. A candidate needs to convince voters in Arizona, Michigan, New Hampshire, and Georgia, states with unique cultures and issues, that he or she should be president. A system that simply awarded the presidency to the winner of the most votes nationwide would produce campaigns intent solely on riling up their party base. If the country is divided now, as it is, imagine a national popular vote election that frees Democrats and Republicans alike from the tempering effect of “swing states” and instead encourages them to juice up antagonisms to drive their flock to polling places. Thus far, only Democratic-controlled states and Washington, D.C., have signed on to the compact. This stems from Democratic chagrin about the 2000 election that Al Gore lost. They believe dearly that he should have been the winner because he “won the popular vote” against George W. Bush. The 2016 election revived that sentiment after Clinton “won the popular vote” but not the presidency. The 2016 election is a perfect representation of how Democrats view the electoral system. Clinton’s campaign ran up vote totals in big liberal cities. Her win by 2.9 million in the popular vote is due solely to her ability to rack up a landslide in California. She secured a margin of 1.7 million in Los Angeles County alone. Clinton was very popular in small pockets of the country where Democratic voters congregate, so both she and the Democratic Party think she shouldn’t have to waste their time trying to win voters in the middle of the country. She didn’t visit the swing state of Wisconsin once after the Democratic National Convention. She and the blue party regarded the heartland as literally flyover country. Basing the presidential election result on the national popular vote tally would make that permanent. Democrats seem to think that because their popular vote margin doesn’t mean anything in the current electoral system, that system must change. In truth, it is the Democrats who must change. They must change to try to win votes in flyover country. It is the same logic behind the Democratic push for statehood for Washington, D.C., which would gift the Democratic Party two senators. Democrats don’t want to have to campaign in states in the middle of the country to get power on Capitol Hill. It should be noted that the compact contains a trigger, and states don’t have to pull that trigger until enough states join to reach 270 electoral votes. It’s just another wrinkle Democrats added to ensure they don’t accidentally award a Republican presidential candidate the White House in a scenario in which the GOP wins the “popular vote” but Democrats win the Electoral College, a possibility this November. So, the popular vote compact fails in principle with what the U.S. is meant to be and fails in concept as a “solution” to an imagined problem, given that it is nothing more than a Democratic power grab. Just as damning, though, is that the national popular vote would fail in practice by making elections more prone to widespread fraud and fuel rampant distrust among the general public. If you thought Trump’s election conspiracy theories were bad in 2020, imagine how many people would reasonably believe them under a popular vote system. A national popular vote would encourage political actors in both parties to engage in all kinds of chicanery, including voter fraud and voter suppression, because the goal would simply be to have more votes total than the other team. While Trump’s claims of massive voter fraud are weak, there is some fraud that pops up in competitive races, such as in the 2008 Senate race in Minnesota, which secured the Democratic Party the filibuster-proof Senate majority that gave us Obamacare. The incentive to cheat in a presidential election decided only by raw vote totals rather than electoral votes would lead to far more fraud on a much larger scale. This isn’t just a hypothetical, given that Democrats in Colorado, Maine, and Illinois all tried to remove Trump from their ballots. That would all but guarantee a Democratic win in the “popular vote,” resulting in a tit-for-tat in which each state ends up with one presidential candidate on the ballot depending on what party runs the state. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER Picture the 2016 election, with Trump leading by some 2 million votes the day after the election, only for California’s glacial vote count to chip away at that lead for more than a month. It wouldn’t be until December that all the votes would be counted in California, giving far more credence to accusations that Democrats would “find” votes to make up the total they needed. The national popular vote compact is lazy, destructive, ill-thought-out, blatantly partisan, and a defiance of the principles that make up America’s federal system. It is thus the perfect Democratic policy. As a means of choosing American presidents, it would manage to make every aspect of campaigns, governance, institutional trust, and the balance of power between states and the federal government worse. Given that both parties claim their last presidential loss only happened because the race was “stolen” from them, this supposed “solution” couldn’t come at a worse time.","summary":"Regardless of who wins and loses the coming presidential election, the nation will be forced to listen to complaints and irrelevant theories about the mythical “popular vote.” What is meant by this is the total count of individual votes for each presidential candidate, added up from all 50 states.

Rogan offered his thoughts on the troubling trend of censorship in the US in a conversation with former Navy Seal, ex-CIA contractor and podcaster Shawn Ryan in an episode of “The Joe Rogan Experience” released Thursday. “I don’t think it turns around if Kamala Harris gets into office,” Rogan said of the censorship trend, “I think they clamp down more.” “I think the same stuff they were trying to do with Twitter they’ll try to do with other things,” Rogan added, “They’ve already openly discussed it. She’s openly discussed the same rules have to apply to Facebook have to apply to Twitter. And that Elon Musk could lose his privileges.” Elon Musk echoed Rogan’s sentiment on X. The Tesla CEO reposted a clip of the podcast adding the message, “Joe is absolutely right.” In a 2022 appearance on the podcast, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg revealed to Rogan that the federal government – including members of the FBI – had pressured the social media giant to censor certain content in the lead-up to the 2020 election. The government influence reached a crescendo following the The Post’s exclusive reporting on Hunter Biden’s laptop. The coverage was infamously censored on both Facebook and X, formerly Twitter. In 2023, the Twitter Files revealed the extent to which federal employees were influencing content moderators at the social media site – especially the Hunter Biden laptop story. Rogan, in his Thursday podcast episode, skewered Harris’ running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. “There’s so many wild things that they’re saying. Tim Walz said that the First Amendment doesn’t apply to misinformation or hate speech. Okay, well it certainly does. It does. People will say things wrong. The goal of the First Amendment is ‘you say something wrong and this guy who is the expert says the right thing’ and then you correct them.” Walz, in a 2022 appearance on MSNBC’s “The Reid Out” said, “I think we need to push back on this. There’s no guarantee to free speech on misinformation or hate speech, and especially around our democracy.” Constitutional scholars maintain that “hate speech” is in fact protected by the First Amendment. Rogan’s criticism of the Harris-Walz ticket comes after the podcaster called out MSNBC for deceptively editing a video to make it appear that he had picked the vice president as the inevitable winner of the election. The left-leaning outlet spliced together two separate clips – one in which Rogan discussed Harris favorably and another in which the podcaster lauded praise on former congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard. “I’m not suing MSNBC,” Rogan said at the outset of an August podcast, “But this is what MSNBC: They took a clip of me talking about Tulsi Gabbard and they edited it up and made it look like I was saying great things about Kamala Harris.” Rogan added of MSNBC, “But they don’t care about the truth. They just want a narrative to get out there amongst enough people because more people are just surface readers.” Rogan has yet to endorse a political candidate for president in the 2024 election.","summary":"Joe Rogan shared an ominous prediction about the state of free speech if Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate Tim Walz win the November election, arguing the Democratic ticket poses a grave threat to the First Amendment.

Kennedy Jr.’s Name Stays on Swing State Ballot","text":"The Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled Friday that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s name will remain on the state’s presidential ballot, upholding a lower court’s ruling that candidates can only be removed from the ballot if they die. The video is from a previous report. The unanimous decision from the liberal-controlled court marks the latest twist in Kennedy’s quest to get his name off ballots in key battleground states where the race between Republican Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris is close. Kennedy’s attorney in Wisconsin, Joseph Bugni, declined to comment on the ruling. The decision came after more than 418,000 absentee ballots have already been sent to voters. As of Thursday, nearly 28,000 had been returned, according to the Wisconsin Elections Commission. Kennedy suspended his campaign in August and endorsed Trump. Earlier this month a divided North Carolina Supreme Court kept him off the ballot there while the Michigan Supreme Court reversed a lower court decision and kept him on. Kennedy filed a lawsuit in Wisconsin on Sept. 3 seeking a court order removing him from the ballot. He argued that third-party candidates are discriminated against because state law treats them differently than Republicans and Democrats running for president. He pointed out that Republicans and Democrats have until 5 p.m. on the first Tuesday in September before an election to certify their presidential nominee but that independent candidates like himself can only withdraw before an Aug. 6 deadline for submitting nomination papers. Dane County Circuit Judge Stephen Ehlke ruled Sept. 16 that Wisconsin law clearly states that once candidates file valid nomination papers, they remain on the ballot unless they die. The judge added that many election clerks had already sent ballots out for printing with Kennedy’s name on them. Bugni had argued that clerks could cover his name with stickers, the standard practice when a candidate dies. Ehlke rejected that idea, saying it would be a logistical nightmare for clerks and that it is not clear whether the stickers would gum up tabulating machines. He also predicted lawsuits if clerks failed to completely cover Kennedy’s name or failed to affix a sticker on some number of ballots. The Supreme Court’s four liberal justices along with conservative Justice Brian Hagedorn wrote that Kennedy’s arguments weren’t developed enough for them to decide whether Ehlke erroneously exercised his discretion in keeping Kennedy on the ballot. They noted that Kennedy didn’t argue that Ehlke misinterpreted the law that says only dead candidates can be removed from the ballot. “We emphasize that we are not making any legal determinations on our own regarding the claims made by Kennedy and we are not agreeing with the circuit court’s legal conclusions on those claims. We simply are unable to make such determinations, given the inadequate briefing presented to us,” the five justices wrote in six-page opinion. Conservative Justice Rebecca Bradley wrote in a one-page concurrence that while she doesn’t disagree with the five other justices that Kennedy’s arguments were underdeveloped, keeping Kennedy on the ballot will confuse voters and could tilt the outcome of the election. “Voters may cast their ballots in favor of a candidate who withdrew his candidacy, thereby losing their right to cast a meaningful vote,” she wrote. “Ballots listing a non-candidate mislead voters and may skew a presidential election. In this case, the damage to voter participation in electoral democracy is real.” The court’s third conservative, Annette Ziegler, joined Bradley’s concurrence. The presence of independent and third-party candidates on the ballot could be a key factor in Wisconsin, where four of the past six presidential elections have been decided by between about 5,700 to 23,000 votes. In 2016, Green Party nominee Jill Stein got just over 31,000 votes in Wisconsin – more than Trump’s winning margin of just under 23,000 votes. Some Democrats blamed her for helping Trump win the state and the presidency that year.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled Friday that Robert F.

Rogan offered his thoughts on the troubling trend of censorship in the US in a conversation with former Navy Seal, ex-CIA contractor and podcaster Shawn Ryan in an episode of “The Joe Rogan Experience” released Thursday. “I don’t think it turns around if Kamala Harris gets into office,” Rogan said of the censorship trend, “I think they clamp down more.” “I think the same stuff they were trying to do with Twitter they’ll try to do with other things,” Rogan added, “They’ve already openly discussed it. She’s openly discussed the same rules have to apply to Facebook have to apply to Twitter. And that Elon Musk could lose his privileges.” Elon Musk echoed Rogan’s sentiment on X. The Tesla CEO reposted a clip of the podcast adding the message, “Joe is absolutely right.” In a 2022 appearance on the podcast, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg revealed to Rogan that the federal government – including members of the FBI – had pressured the social media giant to censor certain content in the lead-up to the 2020 election. The government influence reached a crescendo following the The Post’s exclusive reporting on Hunter Biden’s laptop. The coverage was infamously censored on both Facebook and X, formerly Twitter. In 2023, the Twitter Files revealed the extent to which federal employees were influencing content moderators at the social media site – especially the Hunter Biden laptop story. Rogan, in his Thursday podcast episode, skewered Harris’ running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. “There’s so many wild things that they’re saying. Tim Walz said that the First Amendment doesn’t apply to misinformation or hate speech. Okay, well it certainly does. It does. People will say things wrong. The goal of the First Amendment is ‘you say something wrong and this guy who is the expert says the right thing’ and then you correct them.” Walz, in a 2022 appearance on MSNBC’s “The Reid Out” said, “I think we need to push back on this. There’s no guarantee to free speech on misinformation or hate speech, and especially around our democracy.” Constitutional scholars maintain that “hate speech” is in fact protected by the First Amendment. Rogan’s criticism of the Harris-Walz ticket comes after the podcaster called out MSNBC for deceptively editing a video to make it appear that he had picked the vice president as the inevitable winner of the election. The left-leaning outlet spliced together two separate clips – one in which Rogan discussed Harris favorably and another in which the podcaster lauded praise on former congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard. “I’m not suing MSNBC,” Rogan said at the outset of an August podcast, “But this is what MSNBC: They took a clip of me talking about Tulsi Gabbard and they edited it up and made it look like I was saying great things about Kamala Harris.” Rogan added of MSNBC, “But they don’t care about the truth. They just want a narrative to get out there amongst enough people because more people are just surface readers.” Rogan has yet to endorse a political candidate for president in the 2024 election.","summary":"“I don’t think it turns around if Kamala Harris gets into office,” Rogan said of the censorship trend, “I think they clamp down more.”","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/27/us-news/rogan-blasts-kamala-harris-tim-walz-on-first-amendment/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/90539329.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/HJdrdM5O-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-27 23:44:03","author":"Shane Galvin","authors":["Shane Galvin"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.337},{"id":257693884,"title":"Harris backing Biden's asylum crackdown in border visit","text":"Harris backing Biden's asylum crackdown in border visit Vice President Kamala Harris visited the southern border Friday for the first time as a presidential candidate.

Kennedy Jr.’s Name Will Stay on Swing State’s Ballot","text":"MADISON, Wis. – The Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled Friday that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s name will remain on the state’s presidential ballot, upholding a lower court’s ruling that candidates can only be removed from the ballot if they die. The unanimous decision from the liberal-controlled court marks the latest twist in Kennedy’s quest to get his name off ballots in key battleground states where the race between Republican Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris is close. Kennedy’s attorney in Wisconsin, Joseph Bugni, declined to comment on the ruling. The decision came after more than 418,000 absentee ballots have already been sent to voters. As of Thursday, nearly 28,000 had been returned, according to the Wisconsin Elections Commission. Kennedy suspended his campaign in August and endorsed Trump. Earlier this month a divided North Carolina Supreme Court kept him off the ballot there while the Michigan Supreme Court reversed a lower court decision and kept him on. Kennedy filed a lawsuit in Wisconsin on Sept. 3 seeking a court order removing him from the ballot. He argued that third-party candidates are discriminated against because state law treats them differently than Republicans and Democrats running for president. He pointed out that Republicans and Democrats have until 5 p.m. on the first Tuesday in September before an election to certify their presidential nominee but that independent candidates like himself can only withdraw before an Aug. 6 deadline for submitting nomination papers. Dane County Circuit Judge Stephen Ehlke ruled Sept. 16 that Wisconsin law clearly states that once candidates file valid nomination papers, they remain on the ballot unless they die. The judge added that many election clerks had already sent ballots out for printing with Kennedy’s name on them. Bugni had argued that clerks could cover his name with stickers, the standard practice when a candidate dies. Ehlke rejected that idea, saying it would be a logistical nightmare for clerks and that it is not clear whether the stickers would gum up tabulating machines. He also predicted lawsuits if clerks failed to completely cover Kennedy’s name or failed to affix a sticker on some number of ballots. The Supreme Court’s four liberal justices along with conservative Justice Brian Hagedorn wrote that Kennedy’s arguments weren’t developed enough for them to decide whether Ehlke erroneously exercised his discretion in keeping Kennedy on the ballot. They noted that Kennedy didn’t argue that Ehlke misinterpreted the law that says only dead candidates can be removed from the ballot. “We emphasize that we are not making any legal determinations on our own regarding the claims made by Kennedy and we are not agreeing with the circuit court’s legal conclusions on those claims.

Boston agents arrested the migrants during a multi-day operation on Nantucket earlier this month, ICE officials said, according to the Boston Herald. The arrests come amid a new report that tens of thousands of illegal aliens with convictions for sex assaults, kidnapping, and even murder, are freely roaming around the country. The report finds that some 425,431 convicted criminals and 222,141 with pending criminal charges are not being detained by any law enforcement agency, Fox News reported. Those not being detained have been convicted of a variety of violent crimes including assault, drug offenses, murder, kidnapping, and sexual crimes. Meanwhile, the sting on tony Nantucket saw the arrest of 30-year-old Angel Deras-Mejia, a documented MS-13 gangbanger, who was charged with two counts sexually assaulting a woman in her home. “Angel Gabriel Deras-Mejia unlawfully entered the United States then made his way to Massachusetts, to apparently commit crimes of violence,” Enforcement and Removal Operations Boston Field Office Director Todd M. Lyons said in a public statement. “To make matters worse, Deras-Mejia is a documented member of a notorious transnational criminal organization and represents a significant threat to the residents of Nantucket.” The arrest of Deras-Meja came not long after 41-year-old Guatemalan national Felix Alberto Perez-Gomez was arrested on a charge of indecent assault and battery on a person 14 years or older. Perez-Gomez also has an arrest record in Boston for offenses including reckless driving and endangering another. In addition, two Salvadoran nationals, one 49 and another 28, were both charged with raping a child in separate incidents, and a man from Brazil was arrested for sexual assault, as well. Republican nominee for president, Donald Trump, excoriated the Biden-Harris regime for putting Americans at risk as a result of their massive border crisis. “13,000 people convicted of murder have crossed into our country through Kamala Harris’ open border- non detained, non citizen, convicted criminals!” Trump wrote in a post on X. “Nobody who has allowed this to happen to our Country is fit to be President of the United States!” the former president added.

Trump has meanwhile doubled down on his divisive rhetoric targeting migrants, with the billionaire seeing it as appealing to his base of largely white, blue-collar voters.In his remarks on Thursday, Trump also repeated his claim that migrants were \"infecting our country,\" using language that Biden's team has previously compared to that used by Nazi Germany.Trump and his running mate J.D. Vance have in recent weeks played up false stories about Haitian migrants eating pets in the town of Springfield, Ohio.","summary":"Kamala Harris was due to deliver a tough-on-illegal-migration message after visiting the US-Mexico border Friday, directly tackling the politically explosive issue in a bid to blunt one of Donald Trump's main attack lines in their fight for the White House.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com/harris-visits-border-neutralize-weak-spot-against-trump-3744734","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4550426/former-us-president-republican-presidential-candidate-donald-trump-has-doubled-down-his.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-27 23:21:19","author":"Gilles Clarenne","authors":["Gilles Clarenne"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.254},{"id":257693012,"title":"To Democrats, ‘democracy’ means rule by . . . THEM","text":"Democracy in America: What is it? Whatever it is, we know that it is under siege. Barely a moment goes by without tocsins sounding about various threats to “our democracy.” It used to be that the biggest, baddest threat to “our democracy” was Donald Trump. Then a curious thing happened. When it comes to “threats to our democracy,” Trump seems to have been overshadowed somewhat by a new threat: the Constitution. Today, if you are truly up-to-date, you know that the Constitution, while venerable, is basically at odds with democracy. The Constitution allowed Donald Trump to become president. Ergo the Constitution is “dysfunctional.” QED. Originally, “democracy” meant rule by “the demos,” the people. But most political theorists from Plato and Aristotle on down have been suspicious of “pure,” direct, unchaperoned democracy. James Madison, in Federalist 10, warned that throughout history most democracies have been as “short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths.” It was part of the founders’ genius to have forged a species of popular rule that carefully modulated the passions of the masses in such a way that protected individual liberty in the face of the imperatives of democracy. Hence the Electoral College, which is a primary mechanism for preserving federalism. Hence, too, two senators to every state: Why should Wyoming, say, be swamped by the ethos of California? When Benjamin Franklin, emerging from the Constitutional Convention in 1787, was asked what sort of government he and his colleagues had forged, he famously said “A republic, if you can keep it.” A republic, nota bene, not a democracy. The difference is critical. There is a sense, then, in which the Constitution’s detractors are right about its being “antidemocratic.” It is antidemocratic in the sense that it is pro-republic. The limits on federal power set forth in the Constitution make it a bulwark against many sorts of abuse, including that most constant temptation of democracies, the tyranny of the majority. Yet Americans now find their lives directed by a jumble of agencies far removed from the legislature and staffed by bureaucrats who make and enforce a vast network of rules that govern nearly every aspect of our lives. Woodrow Wilson, a standard-bearer for an earlier incarnation of the progressive juggernaut, welcomed such an arrangement. “The bulk of mankind,” he noted sadly, “is rigidly unphilosophical, and nowadays the bulk of mankind votes.” What to do? The solution was to shift real power out of elected bodies and into the hands of the right sort of people, enlightened people, progressive people — people, that is to say, like Woodrow Wilson. Many commentators have noted the profoundly undemocratic maneuver by which Joe Biden was erased and Kamala Harris installed as the Democratic presidential nominee. After all, nearly 15 million people voted for Joe Biden in the Democratic primary. He won, hands down, because certain high-level Democrats made sure that other candidates — including Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — were shunted to one side. They had done the same thing to Bernie Sanders years before. All, of course, in the name of “democracy.” Which brings me to the distinction between “democracy” and what Democrats like to call “our democracy.” The latter poaches on the authority and prestige of the former. But honestly parsed, the phrase “our democracy” really means “rule by Democrats.” It used to be that the left accorded a certain latitude to opposing views. That’s all over now. Every issue is an existential emergency for which the left’s shock troops are willing to go to the wall. Every loss demands that people scream at the sky. We win or we threaten to burn everything down. At least since Trump’s victory in 2016, the dominant attitude has been that only the left is allowed to win. Any conservative victory is by definition illegitimate, a blow to “our democracy.” To reverse these developments, one major goal of conservatives must be to downgrade the place of Washington, the city as well as the spirit it entails, in the metabolism of American political life. Notwithstanding its overwhelmingly Democratic coloration, the capital has effectively developed into a political party itself. Its triumph stands behind the real threat to the republic bequeathed to us by the founders. That threat is not the Constitution, but subservience to the faceless managerial elite that exercises the real power in our society. Legitimacy is draining out of our governing institutions at an alarming rate. Stanching that debilitating flow requires that we redirect our attention away from the greedy puppet show in Washington to the true source of legitimacy, which is with the people.

A new CNN/SSRS poll shows that Lieutenant Governor Mark Robinson, who is the Republican nominee in the Tar Heel State's 2024 race for the governorship, is now 17 points behind Democratic Attorney General Josh Stein with just five weeks to go before Election Day. The poll is notably the first survey of North Carolina voters since the news broke of an account believed to be Robinson making numerous racist, anti-Semitic, pro-slavery and even pro-Hitler posts on an adult website's message board. While Stein led Robinson in polls taken prior to the story, his new significant lead over the lieutenant governor could be a turning point in the election. According to CNN, if the poll turns out to be accurate, it would mean Robinson is about to \"suffer the largest defeat in more than 40 years for a major-party nominee for governor in North Carolina.\" READ MORE: Ex-North Carolina GOP gov admits Republicans knew Mark Robinson was a 'ticking time bomb' FiveThirtyEight's aggregated polling data shows that Stein holds a double-digit lead over Robinson in surveys taken by both Marist College as well as a poll by the New York Times and Siena College. The last time any candidate won by such a large margin was 1980, when popular Democratic Governor Jim Hunt — who was the incumbent — defeated his Republican opponent by a 24-point margin. Stein's huge lead over Robinson has so far not translated to an advantage for Vice President Kamala Harris in the battleground state. FiveThirtyEight shows that polls of the presidential election in the Tar Heel State have Harris in a dead heat with former President Donald Trump — including the CNN/SSRS poll that showed Stein far ahead of Robinson. Most other polls taken in September with the exception of one show Harris with a narrow lead of no more than two points, which is within the margin of error. Former Republican North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory said recently that North Carolina voters have a propensity for \"ticket-splitting,\" in which a majority of voters will elect a Republican president but a Democrat to the governor's mansion. This happened in 2016 and 2020, when the Tar Heel State's electorate voted for Trump both times while simultaneously voting to elect and reelect Democratic Governor Roy Cooper. However, in that same interview, McCrory noted that the North Carolina Republican Party had known for awhile that Robinson's extreme policy positions and rhetoric could come back to bite them, calling the sitting lieutenant governor a \"ticking time bomb.\" He laid blame for Robinson's likely loss in November at the feet of former state GOP chair Michael Whatley, who is now the chairman of the Republican National Committee.

In another post, the account believed to be Robinson's called himself a \"Black NAZI\" and lamented that he couldn't join the Ku Klux Klan given his race.

Harris arrived Friday afternoon at a site along the US border wall in Douglas, Arizona, where she was greeted by a pair of uniformed officers from the US Border Patrol. The two officers and the vice president chatted as they walked along a path next to the section of the wall, which was constructed during the Obama administration and is not part of the wall built during Trump’s presidency. Asked what she’d learned from the Border Patrol officials, Harris replied: “They’ve got a tough job and they need, rightly, support to do their job. They are very dedicated. And so I’m here to talk with them about what we can continue to do to support them. And also thank them for the hard work they do.” She is also set to receive a briefing from Customs and Border Protection officials in Texas on US efforts to prevent the introduction of fentanyl into the United States. Harris is later expected to announce support for further restricting how people can claim asylum if they enter the country unlawfully between ports of entry along the border with Mexico. Illegal immigration — particularly from non-white countries — has been a key issue for Trump, who rarely makes a public appearance without engaging in incendiary rhetoric on the subject that often crosses a line into outright racism. Trump and his Republican allies have sought to attack Harris for the Biden administration’s record on migration and have attempted to brand her as a “failed border czar” because of her work handling diplomacy with countries that, until recently, accounted for a significant portion of the immigrants claiming asylum along the US-Mexico border. Harris will outline her plan to crack down further on asylum claims and keep the restrictions in place longer compared to the executive order that Biden signed this summer, according to a campaign official who spoke on condition of anonymity because Harris had not yet made the announcement. The official briefed reporters aboard Air Force Two en route to Arizona. Harris also met with Mayor Donald Huish, Cochise County Sheriff Mark Dannels and County Supervisor Ann English, along with Sen. Mark Kelly and Attorney General Kris Mayes. Immigration and border security are top issues in Arizona, the only battleground state that borders Mexico and one that contended with a record influx of asylum seekers last year. Trump has an edge with voters on migration, and Harris has gone on offense to improve her standing on the issue and defuse a key line of political attack for Trump. In nearly every campaign speech she gives, Harris recounts how a sweeping bipartisan package aiming to overhaul the federal immigration system collapsed in Congress earlier this year after Trump urged top Republicans to oppose it. “The American people deserve a president who cares more about border security than playing political games,” Harris plans to say, according to an excerpt of her remarks previewed by her campaign. After the immigration legislation stalled, the Biden administration announced rules that bar migrants from being granted asylum when U.S. officials deem that the southern border is overwhelmed. Since then, arrests for illegal border crossings have fallen. Harris will also use her trip to remind voters about her work as attorney general of California in confronting crime along the border. During an August rally in Glendale, outside Phoenix, she talked about helping to prosecute drug- and people-smuggling gangs that operated transnationally and at the border.

The indictment is the latest effort by the Biden administration to counter foreign efforts to interfere in the election between former President Trump, a Republican, and his Democratic rival Vice-President Kamala Harris. Iran said on Thursday that accusations that it had targeted former US officials were baseless. The three men — Masoud Jalili, Seyyed Ali Aghamiri and Yasar Balaghi — were trying to undermine Trump’s campaign, Attorney General Merrick Garland told a news conference on Friday. “We are seeing increasingly aggressive Iranian cyber activity during this election cycle,” he said. The indictment says the three men used fake email accounts to trick several campaign officials into believing they were dealing with a trusted source, and then got them to click on links that allowed the hackers to steal emails and other internal documents, such as debate preparation material and profiles of potential vice presidential candidates. They then leaked that information to media outlets and the campaign of President Joe Biden while he was still a candidate, the indictment said. Charges include wire fraud, identity theft and computer fraud. The US Treasury Department also said it was imposing sanctions on the three men along with several other Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps members. Trump’s campaign said in August it had been hacked by Iran but said the perpetrators were not able to get private information. However, several news outlets have said they declined to publish internal campaign documents that were offered to them. Biden campaign officials also did not respond when offered Trump’s debate preparation material shortly before the two candidates met for their only debate on June 27, the indictment said. The restraint is a marked contrast to the 2016 election, when hacked communications from Democrat Hillary Clinton’s campaign received extensive coverage. The Iranian hacking team, known as APT42 or Charming Kitten, is known for placing surveillance software on mobile phones that allows them to record calls, steal texts and silently turn on cameras and microphones, researchers say. The three men are currently in Iran and beyond the reach of US law enforcement, but Garland noted that the Justice Department has successfully apprehended other international suspects long after they were charged. “We will follow these people for the rest of their lives,” he said. The Justice Department says Iran’s efforts are not confined to the digital realm. A Pakistani man with alleged ties to Iran pleaded not guilty earlier this month to terrorism charges stemming from what authorities say was a plot to assassinate a US politician in retaliation for the killing of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards top commander in 2020. The defendant named Trump as a potential target, according to a source, but there are not indications he was linked to the two recent attempts on Trump’s life. The Justice Department has also targeted Russian attempts to tamper with the election, bringing criminal charges and sanctions against employees of state media outlet RT for allegedly funding pro-Trump social-media influencers in the US. –IANS khz","summary":"Washington, Sep 28 (IANS) The US Justice Department has said that it has charged three Iranian hackers for targeting former President Donald Trump&#8217;s campaign and were trying to disrupt the November 5 election.

Kennedy Jr.'s name will remain on the state's presidential ballot, upholding a lower court's ruling that candidates can only be removed from the ballot if they die. The video is from a previous report. The unanimous decision from the liberal-controlled court marks the latest twist in Kennedy's quest to get his name off ballots in key battleground states where the race between Republican Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris is close. Kennedy's attorney in Wisconsin, Joseph Bugni, declined to comment on the ruling. The decision came after more than 418,000 absentee ballots have already been sent to voters. As of Thursday, nearly 28,000 had been returned, according to the Wisconsin Elections Commission. Kennedy suspended his campaign in August and endorsed Trump. Earlier this month a divided North Carolina Supreme Court kept him off the ballot there while the Michigan Supreme Court reversed a lower court decision and kept him on. Kennedy filed a lawsuit in Wisconsin on Sept. 3 seeking a court order removing him from the ballot. He argued that third-party candidates are discriminated against because state law treats them differently than Republicans and Democrats running for president. He pointed out that Republicans and Democrats have until 5 p.m. on the first Tuesday in September before an election to certify their presidential nominee but that independent candidates like himself can only withdraw before an Aug. 6 deadline for submitting nomination papers. Dane County Circuit Judge Stephen Ehlke ruled Sept. 16 that Wisconsin law clearly states that once candidates file valid nomination papers, they remain on the ballot unless they die. The judge added that many election clerks had already sent ballots out for printing with Kennedy's name on them. Bugni had argued that clerks could cover his name with stickers, the standard practice when a candidate dies. Ehlke rejected that idea, saying it would be a logistical nightmare for clerks and that it is not clear whether the stickers would gum up tabulating machines. He also predicted lawsuits if clerks failed to completely cover Kennedy's name or failed to affix a sticker on some number of ballots. The Supreme Court's four liberal justices along with conservative Justice Brian Hagedorn wrote that Kennedy's arguments weren't developed enough for them to decide whether Ehlke erroneously exercised his discretion in keeping Kennedy on the ballot. They noted that Kennedy didn't argue that Ehlke misinterpreted the law that says only dead candidates can be removed from the ballot. \"We emphasize that we are not making any legal determinations on our own regarding the claims made by Kennedy and we are not agreeing with the circuit court's legal conclusions on those claims. We simply are unable to make such determinations, given the inadequate briefing presented to us,\" the five justices wrote in six-page opinion. Conservative Justice Rebecca Bradley wrote in a one-page concurrence that while she doesn't disagree with the five other justices that Kennedy's arguments were underdeveloped, keeping Kennedy on the ballot will confuse voters and could tilt the outcome of the election. \"Voters may cast their ballots in favor of a candidate who withdrew his candidacy, thereby losing their right to cast a meaningful vote,\" she wrote. \"Ballots listing a non-candidate mislead voters and may skew a presidential election. In this case, the damage to voter participation in electoral democracy is real.\" The court's third conservative, Annette Ziegler, joined Bradley's concurrence. The presence of independent and third-party candidates on the ballot could be a key factor in Wisconsin, where four of the past six presidential elections have been decided by between about 5,700 to 23,000 votes. In 2016, Green Party nominee Jill Stein got just over 31,000 votes in Wisconsin - more than Trump's winning margin of just under 23,000 votes.

Their relationship is their business,\" he said.\"But insofar as that relationship involves providing Russia what it needs to continue this war, that's a problem for us, and it's a problem for many other countries, notably in Europe,\" Blinken added.The top US diplomat said that China has provided 70 percent of machine tools and 90 percent of microelectronics needed by Russia for military production that includes rockets and armored vehicles.China counters that it has not directly provided weapons to Russia and draws a contrast with the United States, which has shipped billions of dollars in weapons to Ukraine since the 2022 invasion by Russia.Wang told a Security Council session on Tuesday that China \"is not a creator of the Ukraine crisis, nor are we a party to it. China has all along stood on the side of peace.\"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a UN address criticized China and Brazil for promoting negotiations to end the war, saying that forcing Ukraine to accept a peace deal was akin to colonialism.The two countries kept up the drive on Friday, leading a statement with other emerging powers that calls for a \"comprehensive and lasting settlement\" through diplomacy.But in a thinly veiled criticism of Putin's recent saber-rattling, the emerging powers called on all sides to refrain \"from the use or the threat of weapons of mass destruction.\"South Africa and Turkey were among the powers that also signed the statement.Putin this week threatened to use nuclear weapons in the event of a major attack on Russian soil as Ukraine, looking to hit back against the invasion, seeks Western weapons to strike deeper across the border.Since Blinken and Wang last met in July at a regional conference in Laos, China has pleased the United States by releasing an American pastor imprisoned for years, although other Americans are detained.Chinese President Xi Jinping, during a summit in November 2023 with counterpart Joe Biden, agreed to key US demands of restoring military communication between the two powers. He also agreed to taking action against producers of ingredients in fentanyl, the painkiller behind an overdose epidemic in the United States.But a wide range of disagreements remain.Blinken said he also warned Wang against Beijing's \"dangerous, destabilizing actions\" on the South China Sea, where tensions have risen sharply between China and US ally the Philippines.The latest meeting came ahead of the November 5 election in which Republican candidate Donald Trump has vowed to take a harder line on China.Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, who is running against Trump, have said that they seek dialogue to avoid conflict between the two powers, although their administration has also taken a hard line.Blinken's deputy, Kurt Campbell, recently told a congressional hearing that China posed a broader challenge to the United States than the Soviet Union did during the Cold War.","summary":"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday questioned China's sincerity in seeking peace in Ukraine as he directly pressed his counterpart over exports that boost Russia's military.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com/blinken-questions-china-peace-push-over-russia-help-3744731","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4550423/us-secretary-state-antony-blinken-met-chinese-foreign-minister-wang-yi-sidelines-un-general.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-27 22:51:19","author":"Shaun Tandon","authors":["Shaun Tandon"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.01},{"id":257695654,"title":"Helene deja al menos 41 muertos y una estela de destrucción por el sureste de EEUU","text":"Helene, que la noche del jueves entró como un poderoso huracán de categoría 4 a través de la costa del noroeste de Florida, hasta el momento ha cobrado la vida de 41 víctimas, un conteo que puede ascender, y está dejando un sendero de destrucción por el sureste de Estados Unidos. El ciclón ha ocasionado la muerte de siete personas en Florida, 15 en Georgia y otras 17 en Carolina del Sur, dos de ellas bomberos, según confirmó este viernes el gobernador de este estado, Henry McMaster. En Carolina del Norte se confirmaron hasta el momento dos fatalidades, una de ellas una menor de cuatro años de edad.

Casi un millar de vuelos fueron cancelados en EE.UU., la gran mayoría de ellos con salidas o llegadas previstas en los aeropuertos internacionales de Charlotte (Carolina del Norte), Atlanta (Georgia) y Tampa (Florida). Con las primeras luces del alba, los residentes de poblados floridanos como Cedar Key y Perry, este último por donde el ciclón tocó tierra, descubrieron ante sí un escenario dantesco, plagado de calles inundadas, escombros, y ventanas y tejados arrancados. Algunas localidades de esta región como Steinhatchee, pequeño pueblo pesquero que aún se recuperaba del embate en agosto del año pasado del huracán Idalia, vieron como algunas viviendas y negocios quedaron destrozados por la caída de árboles o por la fuerza de los vientos. El huracán tocó tierra pasadas las 11:00 de la noche del jueves, hora local (3:00 GMT del viernes), cerca de la localidad de Perry, en la región del noroeste de Florida conocida como Big Bend, con vientos máximos sostenidos de 225 kilómetros por hora (140 millas). Las inundaciones por las lluvias y la marejada ciclónica, que elevó el nivel del mar hasta más de 3 metros por encima de su promedio, fueron extensivas y en general los daños llegaron hasta cientos de kilómetros hacia el norte. Helene, esta tarde debilitada a un ciclón postropical con vientos sostenidos de 55 kilómetros por hora (35 millas), todavía produce inundaciones y situaciones de emergencia, como ha ocurrido en un hospital de Tennessee, donde 54 personas debieron ser rescatadas en helicóptero desde el tejado del centro de salud que resultó inundado. En este sureño estado, unos 20.000 residentes recibieron una orden de evacuación obligatoria a causa de las repentinas inundaciones y debido al peligro que suponía una represa cerca de la localidad de Newport. En Carolina del Norte, su gobernador, Roy Cooper, alertó sobre los riesgos de peligrosos deslizamientos de tierra a causa de las torrenciales lluvias. \"Esta es una de las peores tormentas en la historia moderna para partes del oeste de Carolina del Norte\", resaltó. En localidades del oeste de este estado se ha impuesto un toque de queda a partir de la noche del viernes, para facilitar las tareas de los equipos de emergencias, según señalaron las autoridades locales. El gobernador de Georgia, Brian Kemp, dijo hoy que varios hospitales en el sur de este estado se han quedado sin energía y que los cuerpos de rescate se dirigen hacia el este, donde decenas residentes se han quedado atrapados en sus viviendas a primeras horas de hoy. La agencia federal de emergencias (FEMA, en inglés) desplegó hasta 1.500 socorristas a la zona de desastres, quienes han auxiliado en unos 400 rescates en el área de Tampa, en el oeste de Florida, además de haber distribuido agua y comida. La Casa Blanca señaló hoy que tanto el presidente de EEUU, Joe Biden, como la vicepresidenta y candidata demócrata en las próximas elecciones, Kamala Harris, \"están siguiendo de cerca estos esfuerzos y están recibiendo información periódica\".

Vice President Kamala Harris made her first visit to the US-Mexico border as the Democratic presidential nominee Friday to hastily announce measures meant to mitigate the ongoing border crisis fewer than 40 days before election day — despite having been the White House border “czar” for more than three-and-a-half years. Harris, 59, announced that if elected the 47th president, she would improve on an executive order announced by President Biden in June that barred migrants from applying for asylum when an average of 2,500 illegal migrants crossed the border for seven consecutive days. Under the Biden order, the emergency measure would be lifted when the average number of crossings dipped below 1,500 — which critics noted would still allow 1.8 million migrants into the US each year, even if strenuously enforced. Harris said her policy would make it more difficult to lift the emergency authority by mandating that the average number of crossings needed to reopen the border drop “below the current number of 1,500.” The Trump campaign slammed the trip to Douglas, Ariz. as a last-ditch effort by Harris to salvage her image on the issue. “Why didn’t she fix it almost four years ago?” Trump asked reporters during a news conference at Trump Tower Thursday. “She’s got no plans, got no talent, got no ability to do it.” Douglas, a former mining town with a population of around 16,000, is located in US Border Patrol’s Tucson Sector, one of the busiest for illegal crossings. Since Oct. 1, 2023, more than 452,000 migrant encounters have been recorded, according to United States Customs and Border Protection data. Although arrests have dropped since Biden’s June order, critics argue that the damage has already been done. “I think what has got to happen is, regardless of the administration, I think that at some places you do need to secure the border, primarily because of human trafficking,” Tom Moffett, a minister from nearby Sonoita, told The Post. “And that border is many times a last stop for someone being human trafficked. “I think that you definitely need to secure the border. I think it became much more unsecure under this administration than it was the last administration, because I’ve got a lot of Border Patrol friends and this is coming from them.” Bill Fortenberry, an actor based in the Old West-themed tourist city of Tombstone, agreed the situation has worsened in recent years. “I see a lot more activity going on,” he said. “I think we have some smart people in office on both sides. And regardless of who wins, I think that it is something that needs to be addressed. Because right now … what’s going on really isn’t working, but I feel for everybody involved.” According to the RealClearPolitics polling average, Trump leads Harris by two percentage points head-to-head in Arizona, which he lost to Biden four years ago. “Kamala’s last-minute trip to the border and empty calls for more security 39 days before the election will not rewrite the past 44 months of chaos, crime, and bloodshed caused by her open border policy,” Trump spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. “Over the past four years as Vice President, Kamala laughed when asked why she hadn’t visited the border, denied the existence of a crisis, and pushed for mass amnesty. Throughout her entire career, Kamala has fought against more funding for Border Patrol, called to abolish ICE, and voted against construction of President Trump’s border wall,” she continued. “The American people will not be deceived by Kamala’s political games — they are smart enough to realize Kamala Harris has been in charge of the border for four years and she has failed.”","summary":"“Why didn’t she fix it almost four years ago?\" Trump asked Thursday. \"She’s got no plans, got no talent, got no ability to do it.\"","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/27/us-news/kamala-harris-makes-first-visit-to-southern-border-as-democratic-nominee/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/2024-09-27T223036Z_206756694_RC279AA7AM2Z_RTRMADP_3_USA-ELECTION-HARRIS.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-27 22:36:00","author":"Cameron Arcand,Diana Glebova","authors":["Cameron Arcand","Diana Glebova"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.417},{"id":257692794,"title":"Jews and Catholics warn against Trump’s latest loyalty test for religious voters","text":"Former President Donald Trump recently reissued his loyalty test to religious Americans, declaring that he can best protect their freedoms while preemptively blaming members of certain faiths should he lose the presidential election in November. Jews and Catholics can vote for him and ace the test, but those who don’t, he says, “need their head examined.” If he loses, Trump added, “Jewish people would have a lot to do with the loss.” Among the Jewish leaders appalled at Trump’s remarks was Rabbi Rick Jacobs, president of the Union for Reform Judaism – an umbrella group for more than 800 Reform synagogues in North America. “Your words preemptively blaming Jews for your potential election loss is of a piece with millennia of antisemitic lies about Jewish power,” Jacobs said in a social media post. “It puts a target on American Jews. And it makes you an ally not to our vulnerable community but to those who wish us harm. Stop.” Trump’s speeches for years have hewed to divisive “us” versus “them” messaging, but tying those themes to specific religious Americans who oppose him is out of line and even dangerous, according to rhetoric experts, religious leaders and academics. “Non-Jews shouldn’t express public opinions about what is or isn’t good Judaism and non-Catholics shouldn’t express public opinions about what is or isn’t good Catholicism,” said Steven Millies, a public theology professor at the Catholic Theological Union in Chicago. “Not only is it bad form, but it’s also an ignorant waste of oxygen.” Asked to respond to criticism from Jewish leaders, Trump campaign press secretary Karoline Leavitt sent statements from herself and several of Trump’s Jewish supporters. The statements didn’t directly address the potential blaming of Jews for a Trump defeat; rather, they depicted Trump as a stronger supporter of Israel than President Biden and Trump’s Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris. “Jewish Americans and Jewish leaders around the world recognize that President Trump did more for them and the State of Israel than any President in history,” Leavitt said via email. “The bottom line is that Kamala Harris and Joe Biden cave to Far-Left extremists and terrorists while President Trump will protect Jewish Americans and put American citizens first.” Trump’s latest provocative comments came in a span of four days. His warnings about Jewish voters were in Sept. 19 speeches to Jewish donors and the Israeli-American Council in Washington. His remarks about Catholics came on Sept. 22 in a post on Truth Social. Matthew Boedy, who studies religious rhetoric as a professor at the University of North Georgia, said Trump has adopted spiritual warfare rhetoric, which is commonplace in certain Christian circles. “Those who gave him that rhetoric saw Satan or evil as the enemy. Now that enemy is anyone – Jew, Christian, Muslim – who stands in his way,” Boedy said via email, calling it dangerous to democracy and religion. “Trump always makes his religious followers – especially Christians – choose. They have to choose him over pluralism, over morality, over evangelism,” said Boedy, a Protestant. “If God is already on your side theologically, it’s not a far leap to say he should be on your side politically. That isn’t new to American politics,” Boedy said. “Trump is only making that divide advantageous to him. He’s furthering that which was there, but he is also adding his own weight to it. Making it worse.” David Gibson, director of the Center on Religion and Culture at Jesuit-run Fordham University, said that in past elections, “for a non-Catholic like Trump to be setting himself up as the savior of Catholics, or Jews for that matter, would have been political insanity.” “But it’s Trump, and conservatives who would attack a Democrat for such language are cheering for the Republican nominee,” Gibson added in an email. “There are many reasons, the most obvious is that they like Trump more than they heed their own church.” Gibson also suggested that Trump’s tough stance on immigration, which includes calls for mass deportations, is at odds with Catholic teaching. “Catholics listening to the increasingly Nativist rhetoric on immigration from Trump and even his running mate, JD Vance, who converted to Catholicism in 2019, ought to have their hearts examined if they support that,” Gibson said. Professor Jennifer Mercieca, a historian of American political rhetoric at Texas A&M University, said typical politicians seek to connect to voters based on shared policy beliefs, not by demanding religious loyalty. “But Trump isn’t a typical politician, and he’s very concerned about loyalty,” she said. “He divides the world up into ‘us’ versus ‘them’ and tries to use those divisions to gain power.” “It’s especially dangerous to attempt to divide people based upon religious identity,” said Mercieca, author of \"Demagogue for President: The Rhetorical Genius of Donald Trump.” “The kind of language Trump is using here is more like that used by an authoritarian personality cult leader.” Trump’s recent comment about blaming Jews if he loses came at an event that also featured Jewish megadonor Miriam Adelson, widow of the late casino magnate Sheldon Adelson. She introduced Trump as “a true friend of the Jewish people.” Among the pro-Trump statements provided to the Associated Press by Leavitt was one from Ellie Cohanim, who served during the Trump administration as deputy special envoy for combating antisemitism. Trump “is absolutely correct in challenging our assumptions about voting on auto-pilot and failing to comprehend that the Democrat Party, which has been hijacked by its far-left base, is no longer a home for the Jewish people,” Cohanim’s statement said. Adelson and Cohanim represent the portion of U.S. Jews that strongly supports Trump. In 2020, he received about 30% of Jewish Americans’ votes compared to 70% for Biden, according to AP VoteCast. The criticism of Trump’s recent remarks came from the center as well as the left of the national Jewish community. The American Jewish Committee – a prominent advocacy group that strives to broadly represent Jews in the U.S. and abroad – issued a sharply critical statement. It took issue with Trump’s suggestion that if 40% of the U.S. Jewish electorate voted for him, “That means 60% are voting for the enemy.” “Setting up anyone to say ‘we lost because of the Jews’ is outrageous and dangerous,” the AJC said. “Thousands of years of history have shown that scapegoating Jews can lead to antisemitic hate and violence.” “Some Jews will vote for President Trump and some will vote for Vice President Harris,” the AJC added. “None of us, by supporting the candidate we choose, is voting for the enemy.’” To the left of center, a harsh denunciation of Trump came from Lauren Maunus, political director of IfNotNow – an organization of U.S. Jews that has accused the Israeli government of oppressive policies toward Palestinians and protested Israel’s military offensive in Gaza. “Trump doubled down on his longstanding pattern of scapegoating Jews,” Maunus said. “Make no mistake: This is a clear and flagrant instruction to his fanatical base of extremists to target Jews with retributive violence if he should lose.” Some Jews found a positive twist to Trump’s remarks, as Betsy Frank of Mattituck, New York, conveyed in a letter published Sept. 23 in The New York Times. “As a proud Jewish woman who believes in Israel’s right to defend itself but supports the United States and everything it stands for even more, I would not vote for Donald Trump for any office,” she wrote. “If he loses the election, I will gladly take the blame.”","summary":"His declaration that he can best protect their freedoms while preemptively blaming some if he loses in November incenses some religious leaders.","url":"https://www.centralmaine.com/2024/09/27/jews-and-catholics-warn-against-trumps-latest-loyalty-test-for-religious-voters/","image":"https://w2pcms.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2024/09/APTOPIX_Election_2024_Trump_22987_d30183.jpg?w=1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-27 22:34:54","author":"David Crary And Holly Meyer,DAVID CRARY and HOLLY MEYER - Associated Press","authors":["David Crary And Holly Meyer","DAVID CRARY and HOLLY MEYER - Associated Press"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.07},{"id":257694734,"title":"Breitbart Business Digest: Just 17% of CFOs Think Harris Is Better for the Economy","text":"Harris Resorts to Wishcraft in Pittsburgh to Win Over Business Leaders Vice President Kamala Harris attempted to transition her public image from a leftwing progressive to a pragmatic, pro-business candidate this week, deploying a barrage of falsehoods and misleading statements but very little policy detail in a speech at the Economic Club of Pittsburgh. “I am a capitalist,” Harris declared. This is the latest example of a strategy we’ve frequently discussed at Breitbart Business Digest. It’s really a form of magical thinking, as if uttering the right words will cast a spell that will shape reality. We saw the Biden-Harris administration deployed this word-sorcery several times when inflation was one of their biggest problems and when it found the public’s dissatisfaction with the state of the economy inconvenient. “We have described this in the past as wishcraft rather than statecraft. It holds that public opinion is swayed not by policy or reality but by the words used to describe it. This is a form of magical thinking in which the right combination of words actually changes reality. The world is simply ‘will and representation,’ as the philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer famously claimed in a book by that title,” we wrote back in January. As we detailed in yesterday’s Breitbart Business Digest, Harris this week cited an analyst note from Goldman Sachs that argued she would be better for the economy. At least twice, she falsely claimed that economists at Goldman had predicted Trump would cause the economy to contract and trigger a recession next year. In fact, they only predicted slightly lower growth under Trump, largely due to a temporary drag from a smaller labor supply due to tighter border controls and also their subscription to the view that tariffs would hurt the economy. Harris has tried to deploy the Goldman note and similar analysis from Moody’s Analytics, run by Democrat economist Mark Zandi, to show that there is a consensus in the business community that she will do a better job on the economy. That, however, is false. While large parts of the U.S. business community may not want tariffs and see open borders as generating both cheap labor and demand for their products and services, the overwhelming evidence is that Trump is still viewed as better for the economy. Take the latest survey of chief financial officers from CNBC. It found that 55 percent of CFOs see Trump as better on the economy and inflation. Just 17 percent said that Harris is better. One reason for that is that the financial officers of corporate America know that inflation, interest rates, tax policy, and regulation are far more important to their businesses than an increase in duties on imports. A 10 percent or even 20 percent tariff on imports, which make up just a small part of business activity in the U.S., pales in comparison to the difference between Trump’s 15 percent proposed corporate tax rate and Harris’s 28 percent. The numbers make this clear. In the survey, 38 percent of CFOs said inflation and interest rates are the most important issues to their businesses. Twenty-four percent said tax policy and regulation. Just seven percent said tariffs. While CFOs do not account for many votes, they do have a large influence on economic growth through their investment decisions. So, the fact that 55 percent of CFOs think Harris is likely to win—versus 31 percent for Trump—is probably already acting as a drag on the economy. A Rare Bipartisan Improvement in Consumer Sentiment As the U.S. presidential election enters its final stretch, something unexpected is happening: Americans are feeling slightly better about the economy. Perhaps even more extraordinary, for the first time in several months, the improvement in opinions about the economy is being felt across the political spectrum. The University of Michigan’s index of consumer sentiment rose 3.2 percent in September, hitting its highest level since March. “This increase was seen across all education groups and political affiliations,” Joanne Hsu, the director of the survey, said in a statement. “Furthermore, all five index components gained, led by a 6 percent surge in one-year business expectations.” Sentiment is still pretty depressed. At 70.1, the index is down seven points from where it was as recently as April. It is nine points below where it was when Joe Biden and Kamala Harris took office in January 2021 and just about even to where it was in the worst month of the pandemic. It is up by nearly 20 points from June 2022, the peak of inflation and down around 30 points from the prevailing level during the Trump administration. The results of the consumer sentiment survey are always skewed by partisanship, with Republicans feeling better when a Republican is in the White House and Democrats feeling better when a Democrat is in the White House. Back in September of 2020, for instance, sentiment among Republicans stood at 98.9 while sentiment among Democrats registered at 67.7. By the following March, GOP sentiment had crashed to 67.4, and Democrat sentiment soared to 102.5. In September, however, sentiment rose among both Republicans and Democrats. What’s more, the improvement could be seen in both the assessments of current conditions and expectations. Among independents, however, sentiment only improved on the expectations scale. The current conditions measure actually worsened. There has not been a bipartisan improvement in consumer sentiment since March. In the intervening months, gains among Democrats tended to be met with declines among Republicans and vice versa. Most strikingly, Democrat sentiment hit its low point for the year in July, when it became obvious to the country that the then-Democrat nominee and still current president Joe Biden was too infirm to run for a second term. That was driven by a sharp plunge in the Democrat expectations index, mirrored by a rise in Republican expectations. What’s driving this? If we had to guess, it would be that as we come closer to election day, both sides are hunkering down and expecting to win.","summary":"Vice President Kamala Harris attempted to transition her public image from a leftwing progressive to a pragmatic, pro-business candidate this week, deploying a barrage of falsehoods and misleading statements but very little policy detail in a speech at the Economic Club of Pittsburgh.\n\n\nThe post Breitbart Business Digest: Just 17% of CFOs Think Harris Is Better for the Economy appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2024/09/27/breitbart-business-digest-just-17-of-cfos-think-harris-is-better-for-the-economy/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/09/kamala-harris-9-25-24-640x335.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-27 22:30:28","author":"John Carney","authors":["John Carney"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.165},{"id":257691330,"title":"Trump Campaign Hacked: How Iran, China, Russia Are Targeting US Elections","text":"The grand jury in the US has indicted three Iranians on charges related to hacking and cyber espionage of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's campaign. The indictment comes in the wake of increased worries over election interference in the US by Iran, China and Russia. Federal prosecutors in the United States have today filed criminal charges in the case. The hackers had allegedly targeted members of former president Donald Trump's campaign. The three suspects allegedly conspired with several other hackers to carry out \"a years-long, wide ranging hacking operation on behalf of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC),\" US Attorney General Merrick Garland said. The charges pertain to an top secret Iranian cyber espionage operation that allegedly stole crucial documents related to Donald Trump's campaign. These hackers also allegedly sent these details to several journalists and key individuals associated with US President Joe Biden's re-election campaign. This was before President Joe Biden backed out and nominated his deputy - Kamala Harris - as the Democratic presidential candidate. \"The defendants' own words make clear that they were attempting to undermine former president Trump's campaign in advance of the 2024 US presidential election,\" Mr Garland said. Court documents revealed that the hackers had \"prepared for, and engaged in a wide-ranging hacking campaign\". These include methods like spear-phishing and social engineering techniques to compromise accounts of several US government officials and individuals associated with political campaigns. A Microsoft report last month said that \"Iranian hackers had sent a spear phishing e-mail in June 2024 to a high-ranking official on Donald Trump's presidential campaign.\" In the same month Google's cybersecurity department said that \"Hackers from Iran tried to breach President Joe Biden's campaign as well.\" \"The message of the US government is clear: The American people, not a foreign power, decide the outcome of our country's elections,\" Mr Garland said. Details on how successful these hacking attempts were, which officials were targeted, and the level of breach have not been revealed by investigating agencies. The United States Intelligence Community or IC had said earlier this month that \"Foreign actors are increasing their election influence activities as we approach November. Our judgements on the activities of Russia, Iran, and China have not changed since our last update.\" Today's indictment is the latest in a string of federal indictments against foreign hackers that have targeted government agencies and individuals. Donald Trump's history with Iran goes far back. During his campaigns for the 2024 presidential election, Mr Trump claimed that US intelligence agencies have reportedly told him that Tehran has allegedly been plotting to assassinate him. Top security officials in the United States believe Iran has been plotting for years to assassinate Donald Trump, seeking revenge for the 2020 killing of Iran's then top General, Qasem Sulemani, who was one of the most influential figures in the country. HOW DANGEROUS IS \"IRAN'S THREAT\" The Attorney General noted that \"there are few actors in this world that pose as grave a threat to the national security of the United States as does Iran.\" Court documents revealed that the planning for these hacking attempts were planned as far back as 2020. They further stated that in May this year, the hackers began targeting and gaining illegal access to personal accounts of individuals linked with the US presidential campaign. The US Treasury Department also took strong action in the case by imposing sanctions on seven Iranians, including Masoud Jalili, who was among the three hackers who were charged today. The United States Treasury \"remains strongly committed to holding accountable those who see to undermine our institutions,\" said Bradley Smith, the current Treasury Under Secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence. Besides Jalili, the Treasury also sanctioned six staff members and executives of Iran's cybersecurity firm Emennet Pasargad. \"Between approximately August and November 2020, Emennet Pasargad led an online operation to intimidate and influence American voters, and to undermine voter confidence and sow discord,\" the Treasury stated. RUSSIAN AND CHINESE \"INTERFERENCE\" The US has also accused Russia and China of interfering in the US presidential election, charges that both Russia and China have denied. While Donald Trump's campaign has alleged that Vladimir Putin is openly supporting Kamala Harris, based on his remarks at a televised interview, the US government has claimed that the Russian media trying to influence the US electorate. China, it claims, is interfering too, based on who it feels would be more suitable for its own global agenda. Both Moscow and Beijing have denied these charges. The US has accused the Chinese government of directly interfering in US's internal matters as Beijing has reportedly made repeated and ongoing attempts to polarise Americans based on domestic issues ahead of the US elections. Beijing is also accused of targeted attacks on candidates and parties. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken had in April this year said that the US has got evidence of Chinese attempts to \"influence and arguably interfere\" with the US elections.","summary":"Federal prosecutors in the United States have today filed criminal charges in the case.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with the White House during his U.S. visit this week to build support for his “victory plan,” as well as having a last-minute meeting with Republican presidential candidate Donald J. Trump. Zelenskyy presented his victory plan to President Joseph Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris on Sept. 26, but media reports suggest it did not receive positive feedback from officials who reviewed it beforehand. The plan's primary objective is to pressure Russia into negotiations within the next three or four months, according to Forbes Ukraine. It remains uncertain whether the U.S. will allow Ukraine to strike deep into Russian territory using American-made weapons, which is a critical component of Zelenskyy's strategy. On Sept. 27, Zelenskyy met with former President Trump, who has consistently criticized him and recently questioned Ukraine’s ability to rebuild. At the meeting, Trump touted his good relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin and said he would “quickly” broker a “fair” end to the war without providing any details for how that would be accomplished. Democratic Presidential candidate Kamala Harris warned that some Republican peace plans for Ukraine were tantamount to surrender, and “are the same as those of Putin,” as they would require Ukraine to cede significant territory. At the United Nations General Assembly, Zelenskyy warned that the Kremlin is planning new strikes on Ukraine’s nuclear power plant infrastructure. These anticipated attacks are part of a broader strategy to strain Ukraine’s fragile energy grid, which has been severely damaged by the war. Zelenskyy toured a military plant in Pennsylvania, drawing criticism from Republicans who said they were not invited to the event, and accusing the visit of boosting Democrats’ prospects in a key swing state for the 2024 elections. The controversy culminated with House Speaker Mike Johnson calling for the dismissal of Ukraine’s ambassador, Oksana Markarova. Kyiv has yet to respond. Read More: No Lasting Global Security Unless Russia Is Defeated Biden's aid package: Following the White House’s meeting with Zelenskyy on Sept. 26, the Biden administration announced a new military aid package for Ukraine worth nearly $8 billion, on the heels of a $375 million aid package announced a day earlier. Biden instructed the Department of Defense to allocate all remaining security funds for Ukraine before the end of his term. This includes $5.5 billion in Presidential Drawdown Authority, meaning immediate aid from Pentagon stocks, and $2.4 billion through the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, which includes contracts with American arms manufacturers for new weapons production for Ukraine. The U.S. is providing an additional Patriot air defense battery and surface-to-air interceptors. It is also supplying Ukraine with Joint Standoff Weapons (JSOWs), an F-16 integrated glide bomb with an 80-mile range. F-16 pilot training is being expanded, and a global cryptocurrency network helping Russia evade sanctions is being dismantled. Biden announced a state-level meeting of the Contact Group on Defense of Ukraine in Germany next month. Ukraine, Regional. Zaporizhzhia region. Russia launched a sustained campaign of glide bomb attacks on Ukraine’s southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia on Sep. 22, a first such attack for the regional capital, that has killed at least one resident and injured 40 others this week. The Kremlin has been using glide bombs, which are equipped with pop-out wings and satellite navigation, with increasing frequency and devastating effect along the front lines and in other regions of Ukraine for months. The regional government is working to find ways to mitigate these attacks, which are expected to continue, but there’s no silver bullet. Glide bombs are nearly impossible to intercept, even with Ukraine’s most advanced air defense systems, as they are undetectable by radar. Russia has significant reserves of bombs from the Soviet era, which have destruction capabilities comparable to missiles, both designed to destroy robust structures. The most effective way to counter glide bombs, which are dropped by airplanes miles away, safely outside the reach of air defense systems, is to neutralize the jets carrying the bombs before they can be launched, as the Ukrainian Air Force has repeatedly emphasized. Kharkiv region. As Zaporizhzhia adjusts to the new phenomenon of glide bomb attacks, for the northeastern city of Kharkiv, Moscow’s Sept. 24 barrage of 8 glide bombs, which killed 5 people and injured 36 others, was woefully familiar. A third of the wounded were hospitalized, with four in critical condition. This marked the third direct hit to a high-rise residential building in Kharkiv in two weeks, according to the city’s mayor. Since the beginning of September, more than 250 houses have been damaged in the city. Khmelnytskyi region: Russian MIG fighter jets launched five \"Kinzhal\" hypersonic ballistic missiles on the military airfield at Starokostiantyniv in western Ukraine on consecutive mornings of Sept. 26 and 27. Though far from the Russian border, the small town of Starokostiantyniv endures frequent drone and missile attacks as host to a key military airfield equipped with Soviet-era concrete hangars that house F-16 fighter jets Ukraine has received from western allies. Although Russian sources reported damage to some of those jets, Ukraine’s Air Force declined to comment on the results of the attack. Donetsk region: Russian troops appear poised to capture Ukraine’s frontline town of Vuhledar, a strategic stronghold at the confluence of the eastern and southern front lines, experts warn. Despite significant losses, Russia’s intensifying offensive is closing in on Vuhledar, a town with rich coal reserves that has repelled attacks for nearly two years, leaving it in ruins. A “fortress,” Vuhledar is crucial for the Ukrainian military, putting it in shelling range of the rail line used by Russia to connect its forces in the east and south of Ukraine. Ruslan Mykula, co-founder of the analytical project DeepState, believes the fall of the town is imminent, predicting it will happen in a matter of days or weeks. Since the start of this week, Russian shelling has killed seven and injured 31 civilians across Donetsk province, according to the Donetsk regional prosecutor's office. Odesa region: In the early hours of Sept. 27, Russia attacked the southern port city of Izmail on the Danube River, killing two women and one man, and injuring at least 16 others. Izmail, an important transit point for Ukrainian grain exports enroute to the Black Sea, is located across the Danube from Romania, a NATO member. Dnipropetrovsk region: Early on Sept. 27, a Russian air strike targeted a police building in the central city of Kryvyi Rih and hometown of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said regional governor Serhii Lysak. The bodies of three victims, a man and two women, were recovered from the rubble of the National Police building. At least six others were injured, with homes and other area buildings damaged. Rescue operations are ongoing, with more victims expected as the rubble is cleared. The Kremlin’s Arsenal: Russia produces between 132 and 171 missiles per month and currently holds more than 1,450 missiles of various types, according to estimates by Forbes Ukraine based on Ukrainian intelligence data. Despite sanctions and supply chain restrictions, Russia continues to manufacture between 42 and 56 ballistic missiles and 90 to 115 long-range cruise missiles monthly, all capable of striking deep into Ukrainian territory. The production of Iranian-designed Shahed-136 drones, which Russia uses near nightly to deplete Ukraine’s air defense systems, exceeds 500 units per month. Russia’s monthly missile manufacturing costs are estimated at $1.1 billion, while drone production costs are around $100 million. These production rates allow Russia to conduct large-scale missile strikes every one to two months, with the potential to cripple Ukraine’s critical energy infrastructure ahead of winter.

Ron Wyden (D-OR) on Thursday announced his latest legislation, which also seeks to implement stricter requirements on the Supreme Court for rulings that overturn laws and proposes mandatory audits of justices’ tax returns. Wyden’s proposal comes amid other Democratic-led legislative attempts to change the high court, including Vice President Kamala Harris‘s recent openness to break the filibuster, as the 2024 election draws nearer. Wyden’s bill represents one of the most ambitious proposals to date as Democrats fume over the 6-3 Republican-appointed majority on the high court, installed with the help of former President Donald Trump and then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY). The measure aims to restore “balance between the three branches of government,” Wyden said after announcing the bill. Under the legislation, each president would appoint new justices in their first and third years of office, with the goal of preventing one party from dominating the court by stacking it with their nominees. But Wyden’s bill is unlikely to pass in its entirety, as Republicans, who control the House, are largely opposed to efforts to overhaul the court. Even Democrats face an uphill battle, with some party members hesitant to support such sweeping changes. And other conservatives and court reform skeptics argue the bill represents little more than a politically motivated attempt to pack the court. Carrie Severino, president of the conservative judicial advocacy group JCN, described the proposal as “a blank check for people who want to harass justices” and a continuation of efforts to intimidate the court. Another potential deterrent for Democrats to support Wyden’s bill is how unpopular court packing has become. While a USA Today-Ipsos poll from August found that 75% of people support a binding ethics code for justices, only 40% approved of expanding the court from nine to 15 justices. “It’s still very unpopular, and yet it continues to be their go-to. I am floored as to why they would decide this is their closing argument here, as we’re approaching an election,” Severino said. The bill also includes provisions to make it harder for the court to strike down laws. Wyden proposed requiring a two-thirds vote by the justices or circuit courts to overturn congressional legislation, arguing that narrow majorities have been too quick to curtail established rights. The introduction of the bill comes amid a broader Democratic push to reform the Supreme Court. Other recent proposals include implementing 18-year term limits for justices and introducing an enforceable ethics code. These efforts follow a series of Democratic-driven ethics scandals involving justices, including Justice Clarence Thomas, who reportedly failed to disclose luxury travel and gifts funded by billionaire Harlan Crow. The debate over the Supreme Court’s composition also resurfaced during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Tuesday, where lawmakers examined the court’s recent decision finding former presidents enjoy some immunity from prosecutions. The Trump v. United States ruling is only one of the latest decisions to become a political flashpoint for Democrats who claim the Supreme Court needs measures to rein it in. Wyden’s bill also seeks to address what he described as the politicization of the judicial appointment process. One provision would require the Senate to vote on Supreme Court nominees within 180 days, preventing the type of delay seen in 2016, when McConnell blocked former President Barack Obama’s nomination of Merrick Garland. However, critics such as Severino argue that these changes, such as requiring the IRS to audit the justices’ tax returns each year, would only exacerbate political tensions surrounding the court. “This is just an attempt to amplify the intimidation campaign against the court,” she said. “If you knew you could file frivolous motions to waste justices’ time, guess how many more would be filed?” While Wyden hopes that elements of the bill can gain traction, the likelihood of its full passage remains slim, with both parties sharply divided in the debate over the court’s future. The senator’s effort marks yet more evidence of how far Democrats are wiling to go to offset the Republican-leaning court under Chief Justice John Roberts, as Harris has said her willingness to skirt the filibuster would be for the purpose of restoring the Democratic-backed precedent of Roe v. Wade, which was overturned by the current high court in 2022.","summary":"Senate Democrats are ramping up pressure against the Supreme Court just weeks before Election Day, introducing a bill that would expand the number of justices from nine to 15 over the course of 12 years.

Bob Casey skewered for video remarks: ‘Just ate him up’","text":"ERIE, Pa. — Grilled chicken breast, baby tomatoes and couscous were served for lunch at the 2024 Shale Insight Conference this week. So was Democratic Sen. Bob Casey. For three days, oil and gas workers from Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia gathered in Erie to network and discuss the future of their industry, from new drilling technology to geopolitics. The senator and his Republican challenger, Dave McCormick, both made their pitches in this northwestern Pennsylvania center Thursday to the fracking industry, which is vital to the economy in the battleground state. A swath of recent polls finds McCormick closing in on Casey; a Monmouth University survey released Friday shows the Democrat with just a 4-point lead among registered voters. While McCormick came in person to deliver his vision of energy dominance, Casey showed face via prerecorded video. Among industry brass, there was no contest. “If you don’t have a seat at the table, you’re on the menu. And McCormick just ate him up,” attendee Jim Milleson told The Post. Milleson, president of the Ohio Valley Energy Association, is a Democrat and said he’d vote for Casey if he lived in Pennsylvania. Still, the no-show senator didn’t do himself any favors with frackers this week. “I was disappointed Casey didn’t show up,” he added. In his on-screen screed, Casey paid lip service to the oil and natural-gas industry for creating good-paying jobs and promoting US energy independence. He also emphasized tax credits aimed at incentivizing the energy industry to open up shop in natural-gas and coal-mining communities and challenged the Biden-Harris administration to expand hydrogen-production tax credits. “I’ll keep pushing, pushing hard the administration until they get this right,” Casey said. But the video ended without applause, and attendees told The Post both the message and the medium left them unimpressed. “I viewed his speech and his support of the industry as mainly a façade,” said Nick Hannan, who works in designing oil and gas rigs in central Pennsylvania. He admitted he didn’t think highly of Casey prior. “He didn’t seem genuine. He definitely was reading. He was swaying back and forth,” said Curt Brooks, who works in oil and gas marketing in Monroeville, Pa. Milleson suspects Casey sent a video assuming attendees wouldn’t vote for him in the first place. “You can’t make a difference if you’re not willing to come. He said the right things, but the message was not received.” McCormick, on the other hand, showed up in full force Thursday, introduced to the crowd as an Iraq War veteran with a sterling career spanning government and the private sector. He took to the podium swinging. “I had the opportunity to see Senator Casey phone in, and I am happy to see him making an energy transition,” he told the hundreds in the hall. “Don’t believe it.” McCormick also resurrected Vice President Kamala Harris’s past pledge to ban hydraulic fracturing, the procedure that uses water, sand or chemicals to extract oil and natural gas from underground rock formations. Pennsylvania is America’s second-largest natural-gas producer, behind Texas. Fracking supports around 123,000 jobs in the Keystone State and spurred $41 billion in economic activity in 2022. Vying for Pennsylvania’s 19 electoral votes this November, the veep now says she will not ban the fractious practice. And while oil production under the Biden-Harris team has finally surpassed that under former President Donald Trump, the administration blocked the Keystone XL pipeline and paused liquified-natural-gas exports into foreign markets — adding fuel to McCormick’s fire. “Casey has endorsed this travesty,” McCormick said, citing the Democratic incumbent’s record voting with the Biden-Harris administration. McCormick laid out his bold energy plans: slash regulation and reform permitting, support nuclear power alongside natural gas, restore clean-energy supply chains and increase cross-border energy flows. “America, led by Pennsylvania, must become the world’s most energy-dominant nation,” he proclaimed. “North America can and should be an energy powerhouse that can compete head to head with OPEC.” Much like it began, McCormick’s speech concluded with roaring applause. “It was like a sports team playing in their home stadium,” Milleson said.","summary":"ERIE, Pa. — Grilled chicken breast, baby tomatoes and couscous were served for lunch at the 2024 Shale Insight Conference this week.

That strategy fell apart Wednesday in Aurora, Colo., when federal law enforcement sources confirmed to The Post that one of the men in a group of armed thugs caught on video breaking into an apartment is an admitted member of Tren de Aragua. So much for Aurora Police Chief Todd Chamberlain’s claim to reporters that cops hadn’t found ties to any gangs among the suspects, and city officials’ larger vehement denial that Aurora has a migrant gang problem. Local authorities don’t want to look overwhelmed by admitting that a gang has taken control of their city. Democrats are determined to run cover for the Harris-Biden administration, whose border fiasco has enabled Tren’s explosive rise in blue cities. The media is happy to buy the lie, since their main goal through Election Day is to smooth Kamala Harris’ path to the White House. But the facts won’t budge: Aurora has been absorbing the unhappy consequences of close proximity to sanctuary city Denver for the past two years. As migrants poured into Aurora, TDA ‘bangers began setting up shop in dilapidated apartment complexes — forcing staff to flee, collecting “rent” by threatening residents and committing violent robberies, shootings and assaults. Even after video footage of the now-confirmed Tren member and his fellow goons stalking through one of the Aurora complexes went viral, Gov. Jared Polis’ office called TDA’s takeover “a feature of [City Councilwoman] Danielle Jurinsky’s imagination.” Jurinsky was among the only local officials sounding the alarm on the gang, even after Tren shot-caller Jhonardy Jose Pacheco-Chirino, a.k.a “Cookie,” viciously beat a man at one of the gang-occupied complexes last November, then was arrested this July for a shooting that wounded two men at the same complex. As recently as Sept. 6, Aurora Mayor Mike Coffman was insisting that “gangs are not in control of either complex.” Aurora police bigs have also been stubbornly denying Tren de Aragua’s proliferation. In late August, the city’s police union president, Marc Sears, called it “absolutely inaccurate” to say TDA was taking over the city, insisting: “They’re not any different than any other documented gang that we have.” Are other gangs terrorizing entire apartment complexes in Aurora? Worse, police threw locals to the wolves. Residents of the complexes claimed that their 911 calls were ignored, and, in one case, an officer reportedly asked a resident if she had considered moving when she called to report a shooting. The message couldn’t be more clear: You’re on your own. Every level of authority in Aurora left residents to fend for themselves as gangbangers swarmed in. Leaders of sanctuary cities, and their unlucky neighbors, have two options: Keep playing pretend and covering for Kamala — or face reality and kick TDA to the curb.","summary":"Federal law enforcement sources confirmed to The Post that one of the men who was part of a group of armed thugs caught on video breaking into an apartment is an admitted member of Tren de Aragua.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/27/opinion/aurora-officials-can-no-longer-deny-the-ugly-truth-of-tren-de-araguas-takeover/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/newspress-collage-00ogowkzp-1727473188321.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1727458855&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/W2TBupam-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-27 22:16:15","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.237},{"id":257690814,"title":"‘Morning Joe’ Mocks $100,000 Watch Trump’s Selling to Fans: ‘Can You Imagine if the Democrats Were Doing Something Like This?’ | Video","text":"“Morning Joe” didn’t hold back when it came to mocking Donald Trump for selling an official $100,000 watch to his supporters. The pricey timepiece is the latest in a long list of items adorned with Trump’s name, face or both that he’s selling to his base. There have also been digital trading cards, coins, sneakers and more. The watch likely takes the prize for most expensive, though, which earned the jabs from MSNBC’s hosts and guests. “Can you imagine if the Democrats were doing something like this?” New York Times journalist Elisabeth Bumiller asked the room. “I saw the Trump campaign was going after Kamala Harris’ necklaces and saying how much they were costing. They weren’t $100,000. This is amazing.” Co-anchor Willie Geist was aghast at the price – and the video of Trump selling his wares. “It’s getting very expensive to be a supporter of Donald Trump,” Geist said. Host Joe Scarborough added that this was his favorite presidential merchandising “since Gerald R. Ford sold his own personalized leather football helmet – and of course Michael Dukakis in ’88 with his push lawnmowers that he signed.” The roundtable eventually tried to dig into why people still voted for Trump, despite moves like this. BBC journalist Katty Kay said there is a significant part of his base that just ignores this stuff. “I was speaking to some business people this week who are Trump-leaning and they say ‘Yeah, OK, he says all this stuff about the immigrants we don’t like, we don’t like his character, but things were more stable under Trump – the economy was doing better under Trump,’” Kay related. “Whether it’s true or not, those are the people who will turn out and vote for him and that’s why the Harris campaign understandably is right to be careful and cautious about the polls. They know there are a whole bunch of people that are prepared to disregard Donald Trump’s rhetoric, selling watches and saying ‘I’m beautiful.’” For those still on the fence when it comes to which candidate they’ll be voting for, it’s looking like that decision might need to be made without another debate. Although Harris has agreed to another debate hosted by CNN, Trump continues to refuse the invite. The closest thing undecided voters might have is dueling town halls. TelivisaUnivision will host Trump’s town hall on Oct. 8 while Harris will have her own on Oct. 10. Vice presidential candidates JD Vance and Tim Walz are set to face off in a debate next week on Tuesday.

Even back then, like Kubrick, he had clear views on war and peace. Today, those views are stronger than ever. “If Stanley were alive today, with the state of the world, he’d make a black comedy,” Modine tells The Hollywood Reporter Roma at the Lucca Film Festival, where he is being honored with a lifetime achievement award. “Not many people know that Kubrick had a fantastic sense of irony and humor. If he were here, he’d be brilliant at creating a comedy about the grotesque absurdity of leaders like Putin and Donald Trump. He’d make a great comedy with those characters.” Modine is at Lucca to host the Italian premiere of his new fim, The Martini Shot, directed by Stephen Wallis. The independent film, shot in just 14 days between London and the Cliffs of Moher in Ireland, stars Modine as a terminally ill director determined to film his final movie. “It’s a reflection on life and on death”, says Modine of the film, which co-stars John Cleese and Derek Jacobi. “I’ve learned from Marcus Aurelius and from Cicero: We are born with death beside us. And rather than run from it, we should make it our friend. Learn to live in the moment, in the present. We don’t know what will happen in 10 minutes, so let’s live here and now, enjoying this conversation.” Turning to the upcoming presidential election, the actor was not shy about sharing his frank thoughts on Trump. “Even eight years ago, I was saying that Trump wasn’t the right person to lead the United States, and now I’m more convinced than ever,” he says, adding that Trump’s attitude toward women is “barbaric, uncivilized, ignorant and rude.” He also wholeheartedly endorsed Kamala Harris: “When we think of the U.S. president, we think of him as a father figure. Well, now it’s time for a mother: Kamala.” He continued to make the case for Harris by pointing to Trump’s multiple felony convictions. “How many charges has Trump been convicted of? If someone gets out of prison for committing a crime, it’s hard for them to find a job, even at a bar. They say, ‘Sorry, we can’t hire you, your record’s tainted.’ So how can someone convicted of so many crimes be considered for president of the United States?” In Netflix’s Zero Day, directed by Lesli Linka Glatter, Modine plays the White House press secretary alongside Robert De Niro as a former president. “Angela Bassett is the current president,” says the Stranger Things actor, “and the U.S. is under attack by a force that shuts down all computers and electronics. We don’t know who’s responsible. Zero Day is when every plane stops at the same moment, or when all computers freeze. It’s a halt in the flow, in the world’s breath. Something terrifying. That’s where the story begins.” Among Modine’s most recent films is Christopher Nolan’s best picture Oscar winner Oppenheimer, a project that raised many questions about the consequences of nuclear power. “We’re living under the constant threat of nuclear catastrophe,” he warns. “What strikes me, though, is the hypocrisy of the U.S. in pointing fingers at countries with nuclear weapons when the U.S. was the first to use them on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. We can’t escape this situation with an ‘I’m right, you’re wrong’ mindset, without considering the pain we inflict. I want peaceful solutions to the world’s problems. We need to respect diversity, even diversity of thought. Otherwise, on this overcrowded planet, we’re 10 billion people destined for extinction.” The actor wrapped up the interview by returning to Kubrick. “Once again, Stanley Kubrick was right,” Modine concludes. “Remember the opening of 2001: A Space Odyssey, when the ape uses a bone to strike another ape, and that bone-turned-weapon transforms into a spaceship? In just a few seconds, Kubrick condensed thousands of years of human history, the very nature of man: violence. But the message is clear: If we want to evolve, we must solve the problem of violence. That’s the thing we need to learn to free ourselves from.”","summary":"Matthew Modine, who famously portrayed Private Joker in Stanley Kubrick’s Vietnam War classic Full Metal Jacket, spent months working with the director and became a close friend.

Trump won the state and its 16 electoral votes in both 2016 and 2020, although Harris is looking to break the streak—and scandals surrounding the GOP candidate for North Carolina's gubernatorial race could help push the vice president to victory.In a survey by CNN and SSRS, based on the responses of 931 registered voters between September 20 and 25, Harris and Trump were tied in the Tar Heel State with 48 percent of the vote each. The same results came from a survey conducted by Meredith Poll between September 17 and 20 that was released Friday—out of 802 likely voters, the candidates were tied at 48 percent a piece.\"Kamala Harris' candidacy has returned the presidential campaign to essentially where it was in 2020—an election that will be one of the tightest in the country's history,\" Meredith College Poll Director David McLennan said in a report that accompanied the survey.\"A Trump victory in the Electoral College hinges on his winning North Carolina,\" McLennan added. \"The Trump campaign will continue to pour resources into the state. If Harris can squeak by and win North Carolina, her chances of winning the presidency are greatly enhanced.\"Nearly all recent polls have shown Harris and Trump in a neck-and-neck battle for North Carolina. By FiveThirtyEight's tracking, the former president is ahead by just 0.2 percentage points on average as of Friday.According to pollster Nate Silver's election forecasts, North Carolina has the potential to be a tipping-point state come November. The top state that candidates are battling for remains Pennsylvania, which per Silver's estimate has a 32 percent chance of tipping the election in either candidate's favor. North Carolina, which offers just three fewer electoral votes than Pennsylvania, has an 11 percent chance of doing the same.Trump's chance in North Carolina could also be tainted after Republican Lieutenant Governor Mark Robinson, who is running for the state's open governor seat with Trump's endorsement, was accused of writing racist and sexist posts to a porn site years before entering the political arena.Harris' campaign has jumped on reports regarding Robinson's past controversial statements by repeatedly tying Trump to the gubernatorial candidate. Several of Robinson's top staffers have resigned since the first report on the scandal by CNN, although he continues to deny the allegations.Trump made his first public comments on the controversy surrounding Robinson during a press conference on Thursday, telling reports at his Trump Tower in Manhattan, \"Uh, I don't know the situation.\"Newsweek sent an email to Harris and Trump's campaigns for additional comment Friday.","summary":"Harris continues to receive good signs in North Carolina, where polls show her neck-and-neck with former President Trump.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/kamala-harris-chances-taking-swing-state-new-polls-1960636","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2482764/harris-chances-taking-swing-state-polls.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-27 22:10:55","author":"Kaitlin Lewis","authors":["Kaitlin Lewis"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.219},{"id":257691066,"title":"Ohio Bishops: Springfield Falsehoods Risk Igniting a Dangerous Blaze","text":"Is Sen. JD Vance telling the truth about Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, eating pets? If not, should a Catholic political candidate be corrected for spreading falsehoods? The Catholic bishops of Ohio have done just that, as has the Catholic Republican governor of Ohio, Mike DeWine. Former president Donald Trump repeated the claim about Haitians killing and eating pets in his debate with Vice President Kamala Harris. Vance, who represents Ohio in the Senate, repeatedly has made the same claim about his state. The controversy illustrates a different concern about Catholic candidates for political office. For many generations, the usual question has been whether the policies of a particular Catholic candidate cohere with Catholic social teaching. For example, 40 years ago, Catholic vice-presidential nominee Geraldine Ferraro of New York City was corrected by then-Archbishop John O’Connor regarding abortion. The 1984 campaign included an extended debate over Catholics and abortion, with Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York, also Catholic, rejecting O’Connor’s teaching in a landmark address at the University of Notre Dame. Unlike that, the Springfield controversy is not so much about policy as how public arguments are being made. Springfield has seen a very large influx of Haitian immigrants in recent years. Local officials and employers stress that the immigrants are legal and needed by local businesses. Citizens also identify problems arising from the influx, including provision of education, housing and medical care, as well as more dangerous traffic. A misreported social-media post about Haitians killing, stringing up and eating cats got wide circulation. Trump made his “eating the pets” claim in the debate. The aftermath led to multiple bomb threats in Springfield, with school closures and deployment of state troopers as a result. Vance — who spent much of the summer on the defensive regarding his previous comments to Tucker Carlson about how “childless cat ladies” do not have as much of a stake in the future of the country as parents — now found himself in another pet-related furor. Were the Haitians in Springfield eating pets, as he claimed? Were they responsible for a “massive increase” in communicable diseases, as he also claimed? Local officials — Gov. DeWine, Springfield’s mayor, local police — said that the Trump/Vance claims were false. Catholics clashed, too, over the Vance claims. Vance is Catholic, having converted to the faith in 2019. Given his prominence as an author and commentator, his conversion was widely noted. Upon his election to the Senate in 2022 and nomination for vice president this summer, Vance was considered by many to be representative of a new generation of Catholic politicians. Thus the Catholic reaction in Ohio was striking. On Sept. 19, the Ohio bishops issued a blistering joint letter against those who “perpetuate ill will toward anyone involved based on unfounded gossip.” They clearly meant Trump and Vance, as they defended “the residents of Springfield, Ohio, [who] struggle with violent threats and life disruptions fueled by unfettered social media posts.” The statement was signed by 10 Ohio Catholic bishops, led by Archbishop Dennis Schnurr of Cincinnati, of which Springfield is part, and including Bishop Daniel Thomas of Toledo and Bishop Earl Fernandes of Columbus. Specifically addressed to the claims Vance and others have made about Haitians in Springfield, the bishops made their own the admonition of St. James: “Consider how small a fire can set a huge forest ablaze. The tongue is also a fire. … With it we bless the Lord and Father, and with it we curse human beings who are made in the likeness of God” (James 3:5-6, 9). It is noteworthy that the bishops are not making a public-policy argument. They note that “if we remain true to our principles, we can have a dialogue about immigration without scapegoating groups of people for societal issues beyond their control.” The objection is not to a policy proposal but to the conduct of the public debate. The bishops object to falsehoods being spread to score political points, with real consequences for the vulnerable. While the bishops do not explicitly say that Vance prompted their joint letter, it is reasonable to think that his prominent Catholic faith was a factor. The message is clear: Spreading “unfounded gossip” to “scapegoat” immigrants is not how Catholics in public life ought to conduct themselves. Given how reluctant bishops are — especially on a statewide level — to enter into the fray of a presidential election, their collective disgust with the Trump/Vance rhetoric must have been intense. Another prominent Catholic leader weighed in the day after the bishops’ letter was released. DeWine published an op-ed in The New York Times, entitled “I’m the Republican Governor of Ohio. Here Is the Truth About Springfield.” “As a supporter of former President Donald Trump and Senator JD Vance, I am saddened by how they and others continue to repeat claims that lack evidence and disparage the legal migrants living in Springfield,” DeWine wrote. “This rhetoric hurts the city and its people, and it hurts those who have spent their lives there.” Again, it was not a policy disagreement, but an objection to how Trump and Vance were conducting themselves. Was DeWine’s letter a specifically Catholic response? He wrote as governor and as someone who grew up near Springfield, but three times in the column he refers to his Catholic faith — twice in reference to the parish he and his wife Fran attend and once in relation to a Catholic orphanage he supports in Haiti. The stress on his Catholic faith was likely more to make a point to Vance than it was to impress readers of The New York Times. “Fran and I have met with so many other dedicated people in Springfield, many of them teachers or volunteers from nonprofits and the faith-based community, who are doing the Lord’s work each day, teaching English to children who speak only Creole or Spanish or helping those who need health care, whether a new Haitian immigrant or someone whose family has been in Springfield for generations,” DeWine wrote. Note the choice of phrase: “doing the Lord’s work.” DeWine has been in Ohio politics for more than 40 years, serving both in Washington in the House and Senate and in statewide office as attorney general and governor. The father of eight children, DeWine is a longtime pro-life advocate. In 2022, he was reelected as governor by a whopping 26 percentage points (63% to 37%), while Vance won his Senate seat by six points (53% to 47%). DeWine’s pointed criticism of his fellow Ohioan was on both political and religious grounds, as both a successful Republican and practicing Catholic. DeWine has bona fides on both fronts that Vance lacks, especially as Vance has recently backed away significantly from his pro-life positions. Sen. Vance explicitly presents his candidacy as an opportunity to disrupt politics as usual. In Ohio this year, he has certainly done so, the conservative Catholic candidate putting himself offside with both the Catholic bishops and the Catholic governor.","summary":"commentary","url":"https://www.ncregister.com/commentaries/ohio-bishops-springfield-falsehoods","image":"https://publisher-ncreg.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/pb-ncregister/swp/hv9hms/media/2024092717094_9550e76e9a72b79d524211801c43e08e7181bb9af490b4de879d5b17e70f66a1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-27 22:08:22","author":"Father Raymond J. de Souza","authors":["Father Raymond J. de Souza"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.257},{"id":257689992,"title":"Phillip Schofield confesses he will 'never work for ITV again' despite I'm A Celebrity rumours as he calls Ant and Dec his 'best friends' following This Morning exit","text":"Home News Royals U.S. Sport TV Showbiz Femail Health Science Money Travel Podcasts Shopping Best Buys Discounts My Profile Logout Login Headlines Showbiz Kim Kardashian Victoria Beckham Harry Styles Amanda Holden Britain's Got Talent My Profile Logout Login Privacy Policy Feedback Friday, Sep 27th 2024 10PM 9°C 1AM 8°C 5-Day Forecast Advertisement Shortly after this picture was taken, this mother-of-two stepped inside the 'suicide pod' - and waited for a robotic voice to tell her...

He is seen pushing his limits to forage and hunt for food and water while taking shelter in a flimsy hut. During the programme, Phillip clarifies that he didn't resign from his position of 22 years but was in fact axed from the morning show by ITV bosses. When asked if he thought he might end up quitting the island he replied: 'It is inconceivable that I would quit. 'I don't quit. I'm fired. But I never quit.'

Read More EXCLUSIVE Phillip Schofield admits he had 'everything in place' for a suicide attempt on Cast Away 'All I have is camera gear and I can say whatever I want about whatever I want. 'It's my chance to tell my side of my story.' 'I know what I did was unwise. But is it enough to absolutely destroy someone?' Viewers will see the axed presenter reflect on the emotional impact of his exile from mainstream TV after news of his affair with a 20-year old runner on This Morning came to light. It's understood that Schofield was given a handheld camera, body cameras and a sound pack before being left to record his emotional week-and-a-half long journey. The TV comeback has been met with disdain by the public with one declaring: 'If this is designed to make people feel sorry for him, it will backfire massively. People were just starting to forget, and now they are raking it all up again.' One said: 'There's shameless. Totally shameless,' while another added: 'How tke [sic] f*** is Phillip Schofield getting a tv show? This is a disgrace.' Scott Bryan added: 'Quite shocked by that Phillip Schofield show but then I remembered that this is Channel 5 so hardly not surprising.' TalkTV presenter Renée Hoenderkamp branded the star as a 'narcissist', adding that she did not think he should be having anymore screen time. She said: 'Is this not a chance for a narcissist to just have more me time on screen? I don't want to know his story, I'm not interested in it.' In a statement to promote the series ,Philip said: 'This is most definitely a first for me and the only thing I felt compelled to do.' 'It appealed to me on so many levels. I've recently had a lot of time to think about my life, what went right and what went wrong, but I've always had the safe arms of friends and family wrapped around me.' While Phillip was alone on the island for ten days, the production team were stationed 30 minutes offshore, and were told only to intervene in the event of an extreme emergency 'This time it's just me, no 'phone, no comforts, no crew and only lip balm as a luxury. I'm looking forward to exploring the island, trying to tie knots to secure my shelter and foraging and fending for myself in the wild … with no help.' 'Maybe I'll be Robinson Crusoe, or maybe I'll just be Tom Hank's Wilson and quietly drift off into the wild blue yonder!!' While Phillip was alone on the island for ten days, the production team were stationed 30 minutes offshore, and were told only to intervene in the event of an extreme emergency. Phillip's mental health and physical safety were monitored as the experience progressed. Phillip Schofield Cast Away, which is a three-part series, can be streamed on Channel 5 at 9pm on September 30, October 7 and October 14.

During the programme, Phillip clarifies that he didn't resign from his position of 22 years but was in fact axed from the morning show by ITV bosses.

Read More EXCLUSIVE Phillip Schofield admits he had 'everything in place' for a suicide attempt on Cast Away 'All I have is camera gear and I can say whatever I want about whatever I want. 'It's my chance to tell my side of my story.' 'I know what I did was unwise. But is it enough to absolutely destroy someone?' Viewers will see the axed presenter reflect on the emotional impact of his exile from mainstream TV after news of his affair with a 20-year old runner on This Morning came to light. It's understood that Schofield was given a handheld camera, body cameras and a sound pack before being left to record his emotional week-and-a-half long journey. The TV comeback has been met with disdain by the public with one declaring: 'If this is designed to make people feel sorry for him, it will backfire massively. People were just starting to forget, and now they are raking it all up again.' One said: 'There's shameless. Totally shameless,' while another added: 'How tke [sic] f*** is Phillip Schofield getting a tv show? This is a disgrace.' Scott Bryan added: 'Quite shocked by that Phillip Schofield show but then I remembered that this is Channel 5 so hardly not surprising.' TalkTV presenter Renée Hoenderkamp branded the star as a 'narcissist', adding that she did not think he should be having anymore screen time. She said: 'Is this not a chance for a narcissist to just have more me time on screen? I don't want to know his story, I'm not interested in it.' In a statement to promote the series ,Philip said: 'This is most definitely a first for me and the only thing I felt compelled to do.' 'It appealed to me on so many levels. I've recently had a lot of time to think about my life, what went right and what went wrong, but I've always had the safe arms of friends and family wrapped around me.' While Phillip was alone on the island for ten days, the production team were stationed 30 minutes offshore, and were told only to intervene in the event of an extreme emergency 'This time it's just me, no 'phone, no comforts, no crew and only lip balm as a luxury. I'm looking forward to exploring the island, trying to tie knots to secure my shelter and foraging and fending for myself in the wild … with no help.' 'Maybe I'll be Robinson Crusoe, or maybe I'll just be Tom Hank's Wilson and quietly drift off into the wild blue yonder!!' While Phillip was alone on the island for ten days, the production team were stationed 30 minutes offshore, and were told only to intervene in the event of an extreme emergency. Phillip's mental health and physical safety were monitored as the experience progressed. Phillip Schofield Cast Away, which is a three-part series, can be streamed on Channel 5 at 9pm on September 30, October 7 and October 14.

The indictment comes in the wake of increased worries over election interference in the US by Iran, China and Russia.Federal prosecutors in the United States have today filed criminal charges in the case. The hackers had allegedly targeted members of former president Donald Trump's campaign.The three suspects allegedly conspired with several other hackers to carry out \"a years-long, wide ranging hacking operation on behalf of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC),\" US Attorney General Merrick Garland said.The charges pertain to an top secret Iranian cyber espionage operation that allegedly stole crucial documents related to Donald Trump's campaign. These hackers also allegedly sent these details to several journalists and key individuals associated with US President Joe Biden's re-election campaign. This was before President Joe Biden backed out and nominated his deputy - Kamala Harris - as the Democratic presidential candidate.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");\"The defendants' own words make clear that they were attempting to undermine former president Trump's campaign in advance of the 2024 US presidential election,\" Mr Garland said.Court documents revealed that the hackers had \"prepared for, and engaged in a wide-ranging hacking campaign\". These include methods like spear-phishing and social engineering techniques to compromise accounts of several US government officials and individuals associated with political campaigns.A Microsoft report last month said that \"Iranian hackers had sent a spear phishing e-mail in June 2024 to a high-ranking official on Donald Trump's presidential campaign.\" In the same month Google's cybersecurity department said that \"Hackers from Iran tried to breach President Joe Biden's campaign as well.\"\"The message of the US government is clear: The American people, not a foreign power, decide the outcome of our country's elections,\" Mr Garland said.Details on how successful these hacking attempts were, which officials were targeted, and the level of breach have not been revealed by investigating agencies.The United States Intelligence Community or IC had said earlier this month that \"Foreign actors are increasing their election influence activities as we approach November. Our judgements on the activities of Russia, Iran, and China have not changed since our last update.\"Today's indictment is the latest in a string of federal indictments against foreign hackers that have targeted government agencies and individuals.Donald Trump's history with Iran goes far back. During his campaigns for the 2024 presidential election, Mr Trump claimed that US intelligence agencies have reportedly told him that Tehran has allegedly been plotting to assassinate him.Top security officials in the United States believe Iran has been plotting for years to assassinate Donald Trump, seeking revenge for the 2020 killing of Iran's then top General, Qasem Sulemani, who was one of the most influential figures in the country.HOW DANGEROUS IS \"IRAN'S THREAT\"The Attorney General noted that \"there are few actors in this world that pose as grave a threat to the national security of the United States as does Iran.\"Court documents revealed that the planning for these hacking attempts were planned as far back as 2020. They further stated that in May this year, the hackers began targeting and gaining illegal access to personal accounts of individuals linked with the US presidential campaign.The US Treasury Department also took strong action in the case by imposing sanctions on seven Iranians, including Masoud Jalili, who was among the three hackers who were charged today.The United States Treasury \"remains strongly committed to holding accountable those who see to undermine our institutions,\" said Bradley Smith, the current Treasury Under Secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence.Besides Jalili, the Treasury also sanctioned six staff members and executives of Iran's cybersecurity firm Emennet Pasargad. \"Between approximately August and November 2020, Emennet Pasargad led an online operation to intimidate and influence American voters, and to undermine voter confidence and sow discord,\" the Treasury stated.RUSSIAN AND CHINESE \"INTERFERENCE\"The US has also accused Russia and China of interfering in the US presidential election, charges that both Russia and China have denied. While Donald Trump's campaign has alleged that Vladimir Putin is openly supporting Kamala Harris, based on his remarks at a televised interview, the US government has claimed that the Russian media trying to influence the US electorate.China, it claims, is interfering too, based on who it feels would be more suitable for its own global agenda. Both Moscow and Beijing have denied these charges.The US has accused the Chinese government of directly interfering in US's internal matters as Beijing has reportedly made repeated and ongoing attempts to polarise Americans based on domestic issues ahead of the US elections. Beijing is also accused of targeted attacks on candidates and parties.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken had in April this year said that the US has got evidence of Chinese attempts to \"influence and arguably interfere\" with the US elections.&nbsp","summary":"Federal prosecutors in the United States have today filed criminal charges in the case.
