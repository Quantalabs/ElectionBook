Even in the best of times, supporting socialism in America can feel like performing a grim duty in the face of almost certain disappointment. The chapter titles in Burnout, Hannah Proctor’s investigation of the emotional landscapes of leftist militancy, are revealing: Melancholia, Nostalgia, Depression, Burnout, Exhaustion, Bitterness, Trauma, Mourning. One of the many virtues of Zohran Mamdani’s remarkable campaign for New York City mayor was that it never felt this way, not even when he was sitting near the bottom of the polls. It was a year-long act of collective joy. Real joy—not the brief sugar high that surged when Kamala Harris replaced Joe Biden at the top of the Democrats’ 2024 ticket. Volunteering for Mamdani never felt like a chore, even when the weather was bad and fewer canvassers showed up for their shift than expected. It was a blast from start to finish, and we didn’t even have to console ourselves with a moral victory. This time, we actually won.\n\n We tend to speak of voting as a civic duty, and of boosting voter participation as a high-minded, “good government” concern. The nature of mass politics, however, has often been anything but staid and responsible. Michael McGerr begins his book The Decline of Popular Politics with a colorful account of a Democratic Party “flag raising” in New Haven in 1876. It was a raucous affair, complete with torchlight parades, street corner speeches, brass bands, fireworks, and rivers of booze courtesy of local party notables. Political spectacle hasn’t gone away, but since the advent of modern communications technology it has become enormously mediated. By contrast, historian Richard Bensel has described the “sheer physicality of voting” and party politics in the nineteenth century. People flocked to the polls, Bensel writes, “simply because they were exciting, richly endowed with ethno-cultural themes of identity, manhood, and mutual recognition of community standing.” It was party politics, in both senses of the word.\n\nThis era should not be romanticized. Aside from the fact that only men could vote, the atmosphere of drink-soddened masculinity that pervaded election campaigns kept most women away even when it did not descend into partisan and racial violence. Even so, it is hard not to agree with political scientists Daniel Schlozman and Sam Rosenfeld that America’s early mass parties “bequeathed a genuinely popular and participatory” culture whose “promise still haunts American politics.”\n\n Much has been made of Mamdani’s extremely effective use of social media, short-form video, and other digital formats that speak to the younger and disengaged voters many other campaigns struggle to reach. There’s no doubt this was a major ingredient in the campaign’s success; historically high rates of participation among Gen Z and newly registered voters testify to its effectiveness. But the sheer physicality of the Mamdani campaign, and the ways it used digital media to bring people together offline, has been underrated.\n\nConsider the citywide scavenger hunt in August. A call went out over social media on a Saturday night, and thousands of people showed up the next morning to race around seven stops across the boroughs, each one connected to the city’s history. Disgraced incumbent mayor Eric Adams denounced the frivolity: “I’m sure a scavenger hunt was fun for the people with nothing better to do. . . . Mamdani is trying to turn our city into the Squid Games.” One competitor offered a different perspective: “I think actually trying to have fun in politics and do a little bit of a community building exercise, a way to actually learn about our city—I’ve never known another politician to do it.”\n\nThe scavenger hunt was just one example of the campaign’s popular and participatory culture. So much of the campaign was in public and in person: mass rallies, a walk through the entire length of Manhattan, unannounced appearances at clubs and concerts, a 100,000-strong army of volunteers who braved countless walk-ups to knock over 1 million doors. From early spring through November’s general election, the campaign assumed the scale and spirit of a social movement, or a Knicks playoff run. There was a palpable buzz around the city—not just in what New York electoral data maven Michael Lange termed the “Commie Corridor” neighborhoods, populated by young college-educated leftists, but in Little Pakistan, Little Bangladesh, Parkchester, and other places where nary a New Yorker tote bag can be found.\n\n When the polls closed, more than 2 million voters had cast their ballots, the highest turnout in a New York City mayoral election since 1969. More than 1 million voters, just over half the electorate, voted for Mamdani. At the same time, over 850,000 voted for Andrew Cuomo, who successfully consolidated many Republican voters behind his second-effort bid to return to public office. Another 146,000 voted for the official Republican candidate, the perennial also-ran Curtis Sliwa.\n\nMamdani’s shockingly decisive win in the Democratic primary had been powered by his core constituencies: younger voters, college-educated renters, and South Asian and Muslim voters, many of whom participated in the electoral process for the first time. He carried these constituencies with him into the general election, but he may have struggled to win the final contest without rallying large numbers of working-class Black and Hispanic voters too. As Lange has shown, the areas that shifted most strongly toward Mamdani from the primary to the general election were Black and Hispanic neighborhoods in the Bronx, Brooklyn, and Queens. Many Black and Hispanic voters under forty-five were already in Mamdani’s column in the primary, but his numbers then were far lower among their parents and grandparents. After securing the Democratic nomination, his campaign made inroads by building relationships with Black church congregations and community organizations, as well as labor unions with disproportionately Black and Hispanic memberships. By cobbling these disparate constituencies together in the general election, Lange concluded, Mamdani successfully renewed the promise of the Rainbow Coalition for the twenty-first century.\n\n Not By Bread-and-Butter Alone Explaining how Mamdani did this has become something of a Rorschach test for pundits. Much of the commentary has focused on his campaign’s affordability agenda, which targeted the city’s cost-of-living crisis through proposals for freezing rents, eliminating fares on city buses, and implementing universal child care, among others. While Mamdani’s emphasis on affordability was necessary for securing the victory, and his economic proposals were popular across his constituencies, he would not have been able to mobilize the coalition he did on the strength of bread-and-butter appeals alone. Mamdani’s unequivocal stances on “non-economic” questions like the genocide in Gaza or the ICE raids terrorizing immigrant communities built trust among precisely the people he needed to join his volunteer army or turn out to vote for the first time.\n\nSupport for Palestine dovetailed with Mamdani’s vocal opposition to the Trump administration’s assault on immigrants, which came together in an impromptu confrontation with Trump’s “border czar” Tom Homan last March. A video of the encounter, in which Mamdani challenged Homan over the illegal detention of Palestinian solidarity activist Mahmoud Khalil, circulated widely on social media and in immigrant communities. All of this helped Mamdani link his economic program with opposition to the president’s authoritarian lurch. In doing so, he appealed to immigrant voters worried about both ICE raids and making the rent, as well as voters who want their representatives to stand up to masked federal agents snatching people off the streets and whisking them away in unmarked cars. Moreover, Mamdani’s identity as a Muslim of South Asian descent undoubtedly activated demobilized voters excited by the idea of seeing someone like them in Gracie Mansion. The historic turnout surge that swept Muslim and South Asian neighborhoods in the outer boroughs is inseparable from Mamdani’s faith, his cultural fluency, and his outspoken defense of fellow Muslims against the Cuomo campaign’s Islamophobic bigotry.\n\nThe New York City chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America (NYC-DSA) has received a lot of credit for Mamdani’s victory, and rightfully so. Mamdani is a DSA member, as are his chief of staff, field director, and other key advisers. The campaign’s field leads, who organized canvassing shifts, were disproportionately members (I coled a weekly canvass in my Brooklyn neighborhood during the primary). But organizations rooted in South Asian and Muslim communities deserve their fair share of the credit, including Desis Rising Up and Moving (DRUM) Beats, the Muslim Democratic Club of New York, Bangladeshi Americans for Political Progress, and grassroots affinity groups like Pakistanis for Zohran and Bangladeshis for Zohran. The mobilization of these communities transformed the electorate and helped Mamdani offset Cuomo’s strength in neighborhoods that shifted sharply to the former governor in the general election.\n\nThere are nearly 1 million Muslims in New York, but until Mamdani’s campaign they were a sleeping giant in local politics. Roughly 350,000 Muslims were registered, but only 12 percent of registered Muslims turned out to vote in the 2021 mayoral election. Mamdani’s campaign turned this dynamic completely on its head. DRUM Beats, which has organizing bases in the Bronx, Brooklyn, and Queens spanning a range of South Asian and Indo-Caribbean diasporic communities, played a key role. Their organizers are committed and tenacious, and many of them are women. “We’re like a gang,” the group’s organizing director Kazi Fouzia told a Politico reporter last summer. “When we go to any shop, people just move aside and say, ‘Oh my god. The DRUM leaders are here. The DRUM women are here.’” When Mamdani recognized “every New Yorker in Kensington and Midwood” in his victory speech, he had in mind the scores of aunties who ran themselves ragged knocking doors, sending texts, and making phone calls.\n\nIn their post-election analysis of the voting data, DRUM Beats detailed an enormous increase in turnout in the communities they organize. Based on Board of Elections data and their own models, they estimated that from 2021 to 2025 South Asian turnout exploded from 15.3 percent to nearly 43 percent, while Muslim turnout went from barely 15 percent to over 34 percent. While representing just 7 percent of New York’s registered voters, they accounted for an estimated 15 percent of actual voters in the general election. Nearly half of the city’s registered Bangladeshi and Pakistani American voters participated in the election, outpacing the overall participation rate of roughly 42 percent. This historic development didn’t materialize out of thin air. Mamdani’s faith, identity, and raw talent certainly didn’t hurt, but people on the ground have been quietly building civic infrastructure in these neighborhoods. In his assessment of the South Asian surge, electoral strategist Waleed Shahid noted that the places with the biggest gains were precisely “the places where DRUM Beats and allied organizers have spent years knocking doors, translating ballot measures, convening tenant meetings in basement prayer rooms, and building lists through WhatsApp groups and WhatsApp rumors alike.” I had the good fortune of getting to know some of these organizers during the campaign. Their capacity to mobilize working-class immigrants who had been overlooked for too long is formidable, and Mamdani’s victory cannot be explained without it.\n\nContinues in DISSENT (https://dissentmagazine.org), November 25, 2025.","summary":"Zohran Mamdani’s victory was rooted in organizations that took up the b a s e &#8211; b u i l d i n g and mobilization functions that once fell&#8230;\n\n\nThe post Partyism Without The Party appeared first on Independent Newspaper Nigeria.","url":"https://independent.ng/partyism-without-the-party/","image":"https://independent.ng//wp-content/uploads/1-452.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-04 00:39:53","author":"Our Correspondents","authors":["Our Correspondents"],"language":"en","source_country":"ng","sentiment":-0.315},{"id":391074948,"title":"TANYA GOLD: I wish celebs like Lineker would follow Queen Claire's lead and JUST SHUT UP","text":"In this month's Harper's Bazaar, the Queen told all 'activist' actors bent on sharing their armchair political opinions with the world to 'shut up'. Of course, these unregal words weren't Queen Camilla's, but came from the mouth of Claire Foy, the actress who played a young Elizabeth II in The Crown. And it was glorious to hear an entertainer honouring their trade above all else.\n\n'What I believe and who I am and where I stand on things is constantly in flux,' she said, 'as much as it is for everyone else, and I have absolutely no authority to discuss or proclaim about anything other than what I do as an actor. If you're just making noise for the sake of it, then you should probably shut up - so I tend to shut up.'\n\nThis brings me to Gary Lineker, who is an expert in whinnying, so much so that sometimes I feel I know him better than he knows himself.\n\nIn an interview with The London Standard last month, he insisted that in his 30 years working for the BBC 'I didn't ever give my political views; never, ever said who I vote for, ever, because I know where the boundaries are'.\n\nI think we know perfectly well where his political sympathies lie. Let's not forget that this is the man who last year reposted to Instagram a video on Zionism adorned with an image of a cartoon rat.\n\nHis subsequent apology couldn't calm the storm that ultimately ended in his defenestration from the BBC.\n\nBut it seems that promoting an image, which is long code for the infection antisemites think Jews are, no longer precludes a man from sharing his moronic moral philosophy as widely as possible.\n\nCollecting a presenter of the year trophy at the National TV Awards last year, he suggested he would continue to speak up for the voiceless, though what exactly he has done for the voiceless - excepting footballers, who we expect to be voiceless - is unclear.\n\nAnd get used to hearing more of Gary's man-of-the-people (just-richer) schtick, as this is a World Cup year, and he has a football deal with Netflix to push. It's not just Lineker, of course, who will continue to show us the way of righteousness in 2026, whether we ask for it or not.\n\nToo many entertainers wade in serious ponds nowadays and, with their very presence, make them unserious - as if politics and suffering are just arms of the entertainment industry, to be treated as such. With unseriousness.\n\nIt's part of the decadence - the lack of expertise and humility, the self-aggrandisement - of the age, but Lineker has more in common with Donald Trump than either would like to admit. Both are showmen with dreams of more.\n\nIf Lineker knew anything about anti-Semitism - or immigration, or social mobility, or the philosopher Kierkegaard - it would be a fine thing to hear him on it.\n\nBut his interest looks like a continuation not of his knowledge, which is negligible, but his vanity, which is ferocious.\n\nIt is no longer enough, it seems, to be known for what you are good at: in his case, chatting about football. You must be sanctified while doing it. It's almost as if he was never loved enough.\n\nLong gone are the days when a reporter asked Elvis Presley about anti-Vietnam protests and he replied: 'Honey, I just seem to keep my own personal views about that to myself because I'm just an entertainer.'\n\nIt used to be that only obvious loons - Roger Waters of Pink Floyd (Palestine), John Lennon of The Beatles (non-specified peace), Marlon Brando (native Americans) - fell to performative activism to make themselves feel more interesting or serious. Now almost everyone does it or, to quote Sacha Baron Cohen as his satirical creation Bruno, 'Clooney's got Darfur, Sting's got the Amazon and Bono's got AIDS!'\n\nMost large charities have celebrity liaison officers now, possibly because they think people are too insensible to care about something unless a big face they have seen on TV, film or at a concert is attached to it. The results are gruesome.\n\nI have still not got over the spectacle of Angelina Jolie (Maleficent) and William Hague, (then foreign secretary) trying to end rape in war and that was in 2014. They didn't end rape in war, but you know that.\n\nLast week, Jolie appeared at the Rafah crossing to Gaza to fail to bring peace to the Middle East.\n\nAfter #MeToo, celebrities co-opted activists and would appear with them on red carpets, like in-laws who had never met before and who, given the choice, never would again. We have Cynthia Nixon of Sex And The City (Palestine and Trans rights), Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson of Harry Potter (Trans rights) and John Cleese of Monty Python (Palestine): they tend to cleave to fashionable causes.\n\nCelebrity activism is so obviously an instrument of vanity - an emotional, rather than political imperative, more to do with the activist than the cause.\n\nThis was amply demonstrated by the celebrities who went all out for Kamala Harris in the 2024 American presidential campaign. She was endorsed by Taylor Swift, Beyonce, Oprah Winfrey and Bruce Springsteen. Harris still lost, and pollsters said the endorsements actively harmed her.\n\nIn Ohio, 24 per cent of voters said Swift's support made them like Harris less.\n\nThat's not good news for the aggrieved the celebrities claim to speak for, but perhaps they are too rich to care.","summary":"TANYA GOLD: In an interview with The London Standard last month, he said in his 30 years working for the BBC he never gave his political views.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-15432129/TANYA-GOLD-celebs-Lineker-Queen-Claire.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2026/01/04/00/105210337-0-image-a-71_1767486094574.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-04 00:28:28","author":"Editor,Tanya Gold","authors":["Editor","Tanya Gold"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.156},{"id":391073410,"title":"This past year was pretty great. Here’s a wish list for 2026","text":"Listening to the usual legacy media suspects, one might think 2025 was an apocalyptic wasteland of sorts – an authoritarian fever dream brought on by the return of Donald J. Trump to the Oval Office. The reality looked very different. This past year was, in many ways, a pretty great and clarifying one. Let’s take stock of what happened when our government remembered whom it serves, as well as what unfinished business remains as we flip the calendar.\n\nFirst, the obvious: Political sanity was restored to the nation’s capital. After years of leftist elite-driven chaos – wide-open borders, hyper-vindictive lawfare, fecklessness on the world stage, and more – the nation has begun to revert back to first principles: National sovereignty, law and order, and strong leadership abroad. Under Trump, the United States has once again acted like a real nation-state that pursues its real interests, not a nongovernmental organization with a nagging guilt complex.\n\nThat reorientation has paid huge dividends. On immigration, the Biden-era invasion at the southern border has tapered by more than 90%. On energy, a renewed embrace of domestic production has led to the lowest average national gas prices in nearly five years. Violent crime, thanks to Trump’s law enforcement operations and innovative use of the National Guard, has dramatically fallen: Murders decreased by nearly 20% from 2024, and robbery and burglary also saw double-digit percentage decreases. Abroad, allies and adversaries alike recalibrated to the reality that the White House once again means what it says.\n\nStill, work always remains. Here, then, is my 2026 wish list.\n\n1. Peace in Eastern Europe. The Russia-Ukraine war has gone on far, far too long. The Trump administration has exerted tremendous diplomatic effort trying to orchestrate a peace deal, which thus far remains elusive. A durable peace – one that halts the senseless slaughter on both sides, respects Ukrainian sovereignty and accommodates legitimate Russian concerns, and avoids a wider great-power conflagration – should be a paramount Trump administration foreign policy goal in 2026. Russia is the invader, and Vladimir Putin is the greater obstacle to a lasting peace, but both sides need to make painful – if, frustratingly, also painfully obvious – concessions.\n\n2. Victory on Birthright Citizenship. Back home, a consequential legal battle now sits before the U.S. Supreme Court: the Trump administration’s righteous challenge to the erroneous practice of constitutionally “required” birthright citizenship for U.S.-born children of illegal aliens. The notion that the 14th Amendment, ratified in 1868 in the aftermath of the Civil War, was meant to constitutionalize a global human trafficking magnet – granting automatic citizenship to all children born here, including those whose parents entered the country illegally – is indefensible as a matter of plain constitutional text, the congressional history in the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, and basic common sense. Indeed, birthright citizenship has been nothing short of ruinous for the United States. A Trump administration victory would restore Congress’s rightful authority over circumscribing citizenship and remove a longstanding incentive for illegal immigration.\n\n3. Improved Affordability and Housing Costs. Legal victories mean relatively little if ordinary Americans continue to feel like they are getting squeezed. Improved affordability must be front and center in 2026 – from the federal level down to states and localities. The cost of living is not an economic abstraction; it affects rent, groceries, child care and the difficulty of buying a first home. Housing, in particular, demands attention. Housing policy should reward supply, not suffocate it – cutting red tape and burdensome construction fees, reforming zoning incentives, and curtailing the inflationary spending that puts upward pressure on mortgage rates. A nation where young families cannot afford to put down roots is a nation courting decline – the very antithesis of Trumpian restoration.\n\n4. Justice for Minnesota Somali Fraud Scandal. The burgeoning massive fraud scandal over state and federal funds for child care in Minnesota, involving many businesses run by Somali immigrants, has become a test case for whether the rule of law still applies when politics get uncomfortable. Justice means following the facts wherever they lead: recovering stolen taxpayer dollars and holding wrongdoers and abettors legally accountable without fear or favor. To wit, on the subject of abettors: What did Gov. Tim Walz (D-Minn.), Atty. Gen. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and other prominent Minnesota politicians know, and when did they know it? Moreover, what did Kamala Harris – who picked Walz as her 2024 presidential running mate – know, and when did she know it? The American people deserve answers to all these questions.\n\n5. Tamed Communist China. Finally, no wish list can be complete without confronting the central geopolitical challenge of our age: that of Communist China. Simply put, Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party, who just presided over their largest live-fire military exercises around Taiwan, must be meaningfully deterred in the Indo-Pacific. That means maintaining a combative tariff posture, implementing as much economic decoupling as is feasible, and emboldening key regional allies – such as Japan – who share America’s interest in freedom of maritime navigation and diminished Chinese hegemony. Decades from now, Trump’s presidential legacy will be partially defined by how he handled the China challenge. Now is not the time to take the foot off the gas pedal.\n\nThis past year showed what is possible when Washington rejects the politics of managed decline and reembraces the best of the American tradition and way of life. Let us hope we will see more – a lot more – of that same success in this New Year.","summary":"'Let us hope we will see more of that same success in this New Year'","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2026/01/this-past-year-was-pretty-great-heres-wish/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Champagne-glasses-New-Years.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-04 00:14:05","author":"Josh Hammer","authors":["Josh Hammer"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.028},{"id":391071544,"title":"Electing Socialists Is Easy.

Multiple times. And it always, invariably, fails.\n\nOr as Garry Kasparov said, \"Venezuela isn't what happens when socialism fails, it's what happens when socialism succeeds. Thuggery and poverty.\"\n\nIn some ways, Venezuela is lucky. In other places where socialism has been tried (and I include communism in this, because they're two sides of the same totalitarian coin), the body count climbs exponentially. But if you look at videos of Venezuelans celebrating in the streets of Caracas, one thing is clear: they will not miss their socialist overlords.\n\nFor right now, America is running the nation, until, according to President Trump, a \"safe, proper, and judicious transition\" can take place and while Venezuela is being freed from the shackles of socialism, parts of America are openly embracing the same ideology that pushed Venezuela from the world's fourth-richest nation into a poverty-stricken hellhole.\n\nThe face of that movement right now is New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani, who just condemned the ouster of his commie buddy as a violation of \"international law.\" It's not, of course, but Mamdani loves the idea of international law (so much so, he says New York is now a city of \"international law\"). Before the election, I wrote how the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) are using Mamdani's campaign as a springboard for the socialist takeover of America, both at the local level and in the Senate.\n\nThey are making the same promises the socialists made in Venezuela: they'll punish the rich, make things like education, healthcare, and housing \"free,\" and everyone will live in the \"warmth of collectivism.\"\n\nVenezuela did that for two decades, and — as I mentioned above — everyone in that country is now collectively poor. The Left looks \n\nWhen voters decided they were unhappy with Maduro's rule and voted him out of office, the so-called defenders of democracy only issued strongly-worded letters while Maduro actually stole the election and remained a dictator. Then again, Democrats really aren't big on democracy. Look at how they installed Kamala Harris as their nominee without a single vote last year.\n\nLook who is squawking the loudest about Maduro's ouster — it's the same group of people who are tripping over themselves to install the same brand of socialism here, knowing full well it'll have the same outcome. And what happens when voters decide they're fed up with socialism? Those so-called \"defenders of democracy\" will prove they're not a fan of free and fair elections after all.\n\nThe lesson from what happened in Venezuela today is this: it's very easy to vote in the socialists who promise you bread and roses, but it takes a military strike to get them out of office. There will be no nation willing to do what President Trump did in Venezuela for America, however.\n\nIt's up to us, therefore, to make sure we never go down that path in the first place.","url":"https://townhall.com/tipsheet/amy-curtis/2026/01/03/vip-venezuela-toppling-socialism-n2668811","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2025/357/1e791f1c-d321-4a2b-ba81-9f5e0a9d30b5.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-03 23:30:29","author":"Amy Curtis","authors":["Amy Curtis"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.246},{"id":391052804,"title":"Sharon Owens promises equity, change in first speech as mayor: ‘Let’s do this Syracuse’","text":"Syracuse, N.Y. – Sharon Owens pledged an administration centered on equity, opportunity and transformative change for the next generation during her inaugural address Saturday. \n\nOwens, who became the city’s first Black mayor, invoked the legacy of activists such as Harriet Tubman, the heroes of the Jerry Rescue, her mother and generations of community leaders.\n\nMore than 1,500 people gathered at the Landmark Theatre before 1 p.m. Saturday for the ceremony, including Gov. Kathy Hochul and Attorney General Letitia James. \n\nOwens, 62, is the city’s 55th mayor in its 177-year history and the second woman to hold the position.

She promised to grow the ranks of the police and fire departments.

Owens also received a congratulatory letter from former Vice President Kamala Harris, who called her a true leader who has fought for access to health care and educational equity.\n\nAG James and Gov. Hochul took the stage to congratulate Owens and reflect on the city’s future.\n\n“Mayor Owens has that rare quality where she puts the people before she puts herself,” James said. “She’s worked tirelessly to restore and revitalize communities across the city, and she’s been a voice for those often relegated to the sidelines of public policy.”\n\nHochul said she plans to work closely with Owens on expanding affordable housing and continuing efforts to reduce violent crime.\n\n“We’ve worked hard with this administration to drive down the violent crime rate, and we’ve turned a corner,” Hochul said. “We’re going to keep that going because every life matters. We must keep our young people alive and give them hope.”\n\nThe loudest applause of the afternoon came when Owens’ mother, now in her 80s, took the microphone near the end of the ceremony. Owens wiped away tears as her mother spoke of her pride and said she hopes boys and girls watching will see the moment and say, “I can do that.”\n\nOwens said she is proud of her service at City Hall over the past eight years and plans to continue many of the initiatives launched during the Walsh administration. \n\nShe also emphasized that she will serve all Syracuse residents, regardless of whether they voted for her, and said she is ready to work for every person in the city.\n\n“Let’s do this, Syracuse,” Owens said. “Let’s move forward together and maximize what’s possible for our city.”","summary":"More than 1,500 people gathered at the Landmark Theatre Saturday for the ceremony, including Gov.

Many of these victories involved a judge issuing a temporary injunction against the administration, only to have the injunction lifted on appeal.\n\nThe ACLU fought to block Trump’s use of the Alien Enemies Act to speed up deportations; it sued to protect the “birthright citizenship” abuse of the 14th Amendment; it claimed the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act must cover abortion; and it sued on redistricting to enhance “Black voting power” in Alabama and Louisiana. It also released videos training illegal aliens to avoid immigration officials.\n\nEvery time the Trump administration acts to restore sanity in government, expect the ACLU to take Trump to court.\n\nSixteen Thirty Fund\n\nSixteen Thirty Fund, a key arm of the Left’s dark money network, bankrolls left-leaning groups, Democrat campaigns, and ballot initiatives across the U.S.\n\nSixteen Thirty Fund spent nearly $311 million in the 2024 election cycle, funding super PACs that supported Vice President Kamala Harris and Democrats running for U.S. Senate in red states. It backed an abortion ballot initiative in Florida and opposed redistricting in Ohio.\n\nThe dark money nonprofit also sponsors a project called Chorus, which trains pro-Democrat social media influencers.\n\nArabella Advisors, which provided management services to Sixteen Thirty Fund and other left-leaning nonprofits, has ostensibly disappeared, but one of its successor organizations (Sunflower Services) is still working with the 501(c)(3) “sisters” of Sixteen Thirty Fund. It remains unclear whether Sixteen Thirty Fund will have any relationship with Sunflower Services or with Vital Impact, the firm led by Arabella Advisors’ former CEO.\n\nSixteen Thirty Fund will likely support Democrats running for Senate, ballot initiatives, and redistricting campaigns ahead of the 2026 midterms.\n\nThe Center for American Progress\n\nThe Center for American Progress, an influential leftist think tank that fed dozens of staff into the Biden administration, has also opposed Trump.\n\nIn April, the Center for American Progress launched a map showing which congressional districts were ostensibly hurt by the grants terminated due to the Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nIn December, the center released a report condemning “climate deniers” in Congress and in the administration, suggesting everyone in positions of authority must agree with the climate alarmist narrative.\n\nExpect the Center for American Progress to make more moves ahead of the midterms.\n\nNational Democratic Redistricting Committee\n\nTrump is attempting to shore up Republicans’ slim majority in the House of Representatives by engaging in redistricting, the process of redrawing the maps of congressional districts, after the 2020 census short-changed Republican-leaning states. Meanwhile, many on the Left have long pushed redistricting for political purposes. Obama-era Attorney General Eric Holder, for example, established a nonprofit dedicated to giving Democrats an edge in redistricting.\n\nThe National Democratic Redistricting Committee gave $150,000 to the Virginia House Democratic Caucus and another $150,000 to Democrat candidate Abigail Spanberger’s campaign before the off-year elections this past November, and Virginia Democrats backed a redistricting constitutional amendment one day afterward. \n\nThe National Democratic Redistricting Committee has opposed redistricting efforts in Texas and Florida, and it celebrated the failure of Indiana’s redistricting bill.\n\nIn July, the committee released a list of 13 priority states for 2025 and 2026, targeting next year’s governor’s races in Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Wisconsin.\n\nThe Council on American-Islamic Relations\n\nThe Council on American-Islamic Relations bills itself as the largest Muslim civil rights group in America, but it recently sued Republican Govs. Greg Abbott of Texas and Ron DeSantis of Florida because they designated CAIR a foreign terrorist organization.\n\nCAIR has pushed the narrative that Israel is engaging in genocide in Gaza, opposed Trump’s deportations, and designated a sitting Republican U.S. senator an “anti-Muslim extremist.“\n\nCAIR does not align with other leftist groups on every issue. Notably, it defends Muslim parents’ rights to opt their kids out of LGBTQ lessons in school. However, it often teams up with other left-wing groups, particularly the Southern Poverty Law Center. \n\nFollowing the Minnesota fraud scandals, which heavily involved the majority Muslim Somali community, and the Afghan national’s November attack on National Guard members in Washington, D.C., Republicans are raising the alarm about radical Islam. Expect CAIR to lead the charge in demonizing these concerns.\n\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center\n\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center has weaponized its history of suing Ku Klux Klan groups into bankruptcy, putting mainstream conservative and Christian groups on a “hate map” with Klan chapters. This map allows the SPLC to demonize its opponents and scare donors into ponying up cash. This strategy has contributed to the SPLC’s massive wealth, even while the “hate map” has inspired violence against conservatives. \n\nRepublicans have rightly drawn attention to the SPLC’s close relationship with the Biden administration, hosting a hearing on the SPLC. \n\nUnder Trump, the FBI has sworn off the SPLC, and the SPLC appears to be losing influence in corporate America, as well. That said, many on the Left still defend the organization, and it seems likely the SPLC will break new ground in demonizing conservatives next year. This year, it added Turning Point USA to the “hate map,” just months before Charlie Kirk’s assassination.\n\nThe American Federation of Government Employees\n\nThe American Federation of Government Employees, the largest public-sector union in the federal government, has fought to insulate the bureaucracy from Trump’s agenda. In doing so, it seeks to protect what amounts to a fourth branch of government, unaccountable to the people’s elected representatives.\n\nAFGE sued to block Trump’s reductions in force, his executive order blocking collective bargaining for federal employees in national security roles, the termination of contracts that unions negotiated in the final days of the Biden administration, and to undermine his DOGE efforts.\n\nThe union claimed that the president attacked “science itself” when questioning climate alarmism. It claimed Trump’s decision to eliminate so-called diversity, equity, and inclusion offices in the federal government was a “smokescreen for firing civil servants.”\n\nWhen Senate Democrats refused to pass a clean continuing resolution to fund the government during budget negotiations, leading to the longest government shutdown in American history, AFGE eventually tired of the charade and called on Congress to reopen the government. \n\nExpect AFGE to continue to oppose Trump’s efforts to reform the federal government, advancing Democrat narratives against the president.","summary":"Next year doesn&#8217;t just mark the 250th anniversary of the United States—it also means another year of President Donald Trump&#8217;s second term and impending midterm...

She believes Democrats are the true patriots and that they are the barrier protecting Americans from \"fascism.\" \n\nThis theme has led to a number of protests which have abandoned woke symbols in favor of a carefully crafted \"pro-America\" costume.

Democrat Rep. Hakeem Jeffries co-opted the words of Republican President Ulysses S. Grant as a strange justification for Democrat driven civil unrest, noting that \"There are but two parties in America right now, patriots and traitors...\" (conservatives, in his version of reality, being the traitors). \n\nHakeem Jeffries: \"There are but two parties in America right now, patriots and traitors.\"pic.twitter.com/oz5C7qSDVr\n— Thomas Sowell Quotes (@ThomasSowell) December 16, 2025\n\nKeep in mind, Democrat activists are the same people who have been celebrating the deconstruction of western culture for years and assert that the constitution is meaningless because it was \"written by slave owners.\"\n\nIn 2022 at the height of their pandemic frenzy, Democrats in blue states and blue cities widely supported a flurry of freedom crushing mandates and pushed hard for the creation of a vaccine passport system which would effectively destroy the Bill of Rights by taking away citizen access to the economy if they refused to be injected with an experimental jab.\n\nThat same year, a Heartland Institute and Rasmussen Reports national telephone and online survey found that 48% of voters favored President Joe Biden’s plan to impose a COVID-19 vaccine mandate on the employees of large companies and government agencies. The same survey showed that a disturbing number of Democrats also supported \"Chinese-style\" punishments for people who refused to take the jab.\n\nAround 55% of Democrat voters were in favor of government enforced fines for the unvaccinated. Nearly 60% supported forced home confinement for the unvaccinated. 48% of Democrats were in favor of fines and prison time for anyone who publicly questioned the efficacy of the vaccines. Around 45% of Democrats supported the idea of confining the unvaccinated to \"designated facilities\" (covid camps) until they complied. 47% of Democrats favored the use of digital tracking for the unvaccinated.\n\nAround 30% of progressive voters suggested taking children away from parents who refused to vaccinate. The Biden Administration and Democrats were exposed for violating constitutional law in their efforts to pressure social media companies to silence and censor conservative critics of covid policies (among other things). \n\nAnyone who stood against the mandates was accused of being a threat to democracy and a potential terrorist. The Democrats initiated a propaganda war against US patriots; a war which they ultimately lost. Now, they want you to forget all about their many trespasses and accept their new image as \"freedom fighters\" saving the country from Trump's tyrannical policies...which the majority of Americans voted for.","url":"https://www.zerohedge.com/political/democrats-now-claim-they-are-real-american-patriots","image":"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/16_9_max_700/public/2025-12/ICEprotest1.jpg?itok=b5kI5TCl","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-03 16:05:00","author":"Tyler Durden","authors":["Tyler Durden"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.349},{"id":391031330,"title":"Mark Z. Barabak: Democrats are on a roll. So why not fight one another?","text":"Democrats are starting the new year on a high.\n\nA series of 2025 victories, in red and blue states alike, was marked by a striking improvement over the party's 2024 showing. That over-performance, to use the political term of art, means candidates - including even some who lost - received a significantly higher percentage of the vote than presidential candidate Kamala Harris managed.\n\nThat's a strong signal ahead of the midterm election, suggesting Democratic partisans are energized, a key ingredient in any successful campaign, and the party is winning support among independents and perhaps even a few disaffected Republicans.\n\nIf history is a guide and the uneven economy a portent, Democrats will very likely seize control of the House in November, picking up at least the three seats needed to erase the GOP's bare majority. The Senate looks to be a longer - though not impossible - reach, given the Republican lean of the states being contested.\n\nIn short, Democrats are in much better shape than all the black crepe and existential ideations suggested a year ago.\n\nYes, the party suffered a soul-crushing defeat in the presidential race. But 2024 was never the disaster some made it out to be. Democrats gained two House seats and held their own in most contests apart from the fight for the Senate, where several Republican states reverted to form and ousted the chamber's few remaining Democratic holdouts.\n\nStill, Democrats being Democrats, all is not happiness and light in the party of Jefferson, Jackson, Clinton and Obama.\n\nCampaigning to become the party's chairman, Ken Martin last winter promised to conduct a thorough review of the 2024 election and to make its findings public, as a step toward redressing Democrats' mistakes and bolstering the party going forward.\n\n\"What we need to do right now is really start to get a handle around what happened,\" he told reporters before his election.\n\nNow Martin has decided to bury that autopsy report.\n\n\"Here's our North Star: Does this help us win?\" he said in a mid-December statement announcing his turnabout and the study's unceremonious interment. \"If the answer is no, it's a distraction from the core mission.\"\n\nThere is certainly no shortage of 2024 election analyses for the asking. The sifting of rubble, pointing of fingers and laying of blame began an eye blink after Donald Trump was declared the winner.\n\nThere are prescriptions from the moderate and progressive wings of the party - suggesting, naturally, that Democrats absolutely must move their direction to stand any chance of ever winning again. There are diagnoses from a welter of 2028 presidential hopefuls, declared and undeclared, offering themselves as both seer and Democratic savior.\n\nThe report Martin commissioned was, however, supposed to be the definitive word from the party, offering both a clear-eyed look back and a clarion way forward.\n\n\"We know that we lost ground with Latino voters,\" he said in those searching days before he became party chairman. \"We know we lost ground with women and younger voters and, of course, working-class voters. We don't know the how and why yet.\"\n\nAs part of the investigation, more than 300 Democrats were interviewed in each of the 50 states. But there was good reason to doubt the integrity of the report, even before Martin pulled out his shovel and started digging.\n\nAccording to the New York Times and others, there was no plan to examine President Biden's headstrong decision to seek reelectiondespite his advanced age and no intention to second-guess any of the strategic decisions Harris made in her hurry-up campaign.\n\nWhich is like setting out to solve a murder by ignoring the weapon used and skipping past the cause of death.\n\nCurious, indeed.\n\nStill, there was predictable outrage when Martin went back on his promise.\n\n\"This is a very bad decision that reeks of the caution and complacency that brought us to this moment,\" Dan Pfeiffer, an alumnus of the Obama White House, posted on social media.\n\n\"The people who volunteered, donated and voted deserve to know what went wrong,\" Jamal Simmons, a former Harris vice presidential advisor, told the Hill newspaper. \"The DNC should tell them.\"\n\nIn 2013, Republicans commissioned a similar after-action assessment following Mitt Romney's loss to President Obama. It was scathing in its blunt-force commentary.\n\nThe 98-page report said a smug, uncaring, ideologically rigid party was turning off voters with stale policies that had changed little in decades and was unhelpfully projecting an image that alienated minorities and young voters.\n\nAmong its recommendation, the postmortem called on the party to develop \"a more welcoming brand of conservatism\" and suggested an extensive set of \"inclusion\" proposals for minority groups, including Latinos, Asians and African Americans. (DEI, anyone?)\n\n\"Unless changes are made,\" the report concluded, \"it will be increasingly difficult for Republicans to win another presidential election in the near future.\"\n\nTrump, of course, won the White House three years later doing precisely none of what the report recommended.\n\nWhich suggests the Democratic autopsy, buried or otherwise, is not likely to matter a whole lot when voters go to the polls. (It's the affordability, stupid.)\n\nThat said, Martin should have released the appraisal and not just because of the time and effort invested. There was already Democratic hostility toward the chairman, particularly among donors unhappy with his leadership and performance, and his entombing of the autopsy report won't help.\n\nMartin gave his word, and breaking it is a needless distraction and blemish on the party.\n\nBesides, a bit of thoughtful self-reflection is never a bad thing. It's hard to look forward when you've got your head stuck in the sand.\n\nTribune National\n\nThis story was originally published January 3, 2026 at 8:03 AM.","url":"https://www.sacbee.com/opinion/us-viewpoints/article314142697.html","image":"https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/public/incoming/bdbote/picture314142348/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/f8fcf3d5-1835-4a97-8099-5a8b922ea82d","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-03 16:03:56","author":"Saul Loeb/pool","authors":["Saul Loeb/pool"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.325},{"id":390917048,"title":"How Republicans Can Win Gen Z Women","text":"Gen Z women, the most liberal demographic in the country, are becoming a powerful share of the electorate. Yet conservatives are misreading what actually drives our political decisions. While the legacy media fixates on a supposed surge of right-leaning youth, the reality is more complicated. Young women are not moving right because Republicans keep repeating the same mistakes Democrats made with young voters in the last election cycle. \n\nLast year, I wrote about former presidential hopeful Kamala Harris’s failed attempt at being hip with the cool girls during her 2024 campaign. During a year when women were suffering sexual violence in conflicts from Gaza to Ukraine, and when the prospect of marriage and family felt economically out of reach, Harris had countless opportunities to show young women she understood our concerns. Instead, she fixated on the fact that British musician Charli XCX made a pop culture reference about her, invited social media influencers to the Democratic National Convention, and appeared on a sex podcast while Americans were dying in a hurricane. Harris’s endeavor to win over the youth was more than wildly unsuccessful. It was vapid, unserious, and embarrassing. It communicated a belief that young women’s concerns begin and end with oversexed pop culture. \n\nUnfortunately, the opposing party took one look at this abysmal playbook and rushed to copy it point for point. Contrary to the misinformation peddled by left-wing reactionaries, the political Right has taken great strides to advance women’s rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. It was the Republican Party, after all, that advanced women’s suffrage. President Trump made history with his cabinet picks, the elevation of Susie Wiles and Karoline Leavitt to positions of prominence, and his wife Melania authoring the TAKE IT DOWN Act, which criminalizes non-consensual AI deepfake pornography. Bulldogs like Nancy Mace are fighting for womanhood to be recognized as an objective biological reality rather than an identity open to manipulation or erasure.

They have now seized a lead of 4 percentage points in polling on voters’ “generic” party preference for 2026, according to the RealClearPolitics average. \n\n“Everything we’re seeing in the off-year election is consistent with a historical pattern that benefits the out party,” House redistricting guru David Wasserman, of the Cook Political Report, told The Post. “The president’s approval rating, the enthusiasm gap that we see between the parties — these are all factors in the Democrats’ favor.”\n\nRetaking the House, where Republicans are gripping tight to their 220-213 majority, would give Democrats the ability to push their own tax and spending measures — and investigate or otherwise harass President Trump. The GOP got a tad more breathing room Dec. 2, after Republican Matt Van Epps held back a challenge by Democrat Aftyn Behn in Tennessee’s 7th Congressional District in a special election.\n\nA dozen Republican-held seats are now positioned in the “toss-up” category — and each party holds a sizable war chest. The Democratic campaign arm had $47 million at the end of October, compared to $46 million for the Republicans.\n\n“There’s really not that many competitive seats,” Rep. Mike Lawler (R-NY) told The Post. “A lot of the focus is on a handful of races. The money pouring into it is insane.”\n\n“It’s a tough situation for Republicans, because Democrats don’t need to have an amazing night to take the House because the margin is so narrow,” said Erin Covey of the Cook Political Report.\n\nHere are some of the top battlegrounds that will determine control:\n\nDemocrats have been itching to take down Sen. Susan Collins (R) for years. But the powerful Senate Appropriations chair is a survivor. They gushed about Graham Platner, a former Army and Marine Corps vet and oyster farmer, until his Nazi-linked tattoo came to light this fall. (Platner said he was unaware of the symbolism and had it covered up). Gov. Janet Mills (D), 77, is Sen. Chuck Schumer’s (D-NY) preferred candidate.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nDemocrats got their contender in former Gov. Roy Cooper in the race to succeed retiring Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.). He currently leads former Trump-picked RNC chair Michael Whatley in an early Emerson poll, after Lara Trump stayed out of the race.\n\nTwo Democrats — Rep. Haley Stevens, 42, and state Sen. Mallory McMorrow, 39 — are competing to see who will take on former former GOP Rep. Mike Rogers. Rogers, 62, previously served as the chair of the House Intelligence Committee but narrowly lost to now-Sen. Elissa Slotkin, by fewer than 20,000 votes, in 2024 while running for the Senate alongside Trump.\n\nSen. Jon Ossoff is running for re-election as the Senate’s best funded — and most vulnerable — Democrat. He could benefit from a divided primary in a Republican-leaning state. Competing to take him on are Rep. Mike Collins (R), Rep. Buddy Carter (R), and former University of Tennessee football coach Derek Dooley.\n\nDemocrats have eyed Senate races in the Lone Star State for years, usually suffering disappointment. Sen. John Cornyn (R), 73, is seeking reelection. State AG Ken Paxton (R) leads him in a recent co/efficient poll, but carries more baggage while facing a divorce from his wife, state Sen. Angela Paxton, who cited “biblical grounds.” Rep. Wesley Hunt’s (R) decision to run makes a runoff almost certain.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nFormer Sen. John E. Sununu (R) is running to reclaim the seat he lost in 2008 to now-retiring Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D). He says he wants to “lower the temperature” in DC, but Rep. Chris Pappas (D) will try to turn up the heat on any Republican who might help President Trump. Also seeking the seat is former Sen. Scott Brown (R-Mass.), who lost his seat to Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) in 2012.\n\nIowa 1st District\n\nRep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks (R) holds one of two or three vulnerable Iowa seats in her state. University of Iowa law professor Christina Bohannan, a Democrat, came about 800 votes short against Miller-Meeks two years ago. Miller-Meeks won her first term back in 2020 against Rita Hart by just 6 votes. The rematch against top recruit Bohannan — without Trump on the ballot — makes it one of the country’s top tossup races.\n\nPennsylvania 1st Congressional District\n\nBucks County Commissioner Bob Harvie (D) is running neck-and-neck with Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R) in this suburban Philadelphia district, one of the nation’s most hotly contested. It is high on the Democrats’ target list. Kamala Harris won the district last year, but Fitzpatrick has found ways to hit 50% of the vote in past elections. He voted against Trump’s budget bill in July.\n\nNew York 17th Congressional District\n\nRep. Mike Lawler (D) has found ways to win in the past, but faces headwinds from Trump and the political environment in a district carried by Harris in the presidential race. “It’s one of the races that could make or break the majority. I see Lawler as highly vulnerable, even though he won convincingly against [former Democratic Rep.] Mondaire Jones last time,” said Wasserman. Lawler told The Post the race could end up costing a combined $60 million. “My seat obviously is critical towards keeping the majority. The Democrats obviously have put a big target on me … I know I’ll have the strong support of the Party and the outside groups,” he said.\n\nNew York 4th Congressional District\n\nFirst-term Rep. Laura Gillen (D) is considered one of the most endangered Democrats in the country in her bid to maintain her Long Island district, and her vulnerability shows in some of her recent votes. Gillen, who knocked off Rep. Anthony D’Esposito, voted to stiffen prison sentences for migrants who repeatedly enter the country illegally. She also joined Republicans to back a resolution disapproving of fellow Democrat Rep. Chuy Garcia (D-Ill.) for trying to install a successor in his seat without a primary, carving out one of the most conservative Democratic voting records in Congress. Republicans are still settling on a nominee, but this month the GOP’s campaign arm hammered Gillen for taking credit for nearly $1 million for firefighters in her district despite voting against a bill to reopen the government during the shutdown.","summary":"With less than a year before the 2026 general elections, Democrats need to gain a net of four seats to win a majority in the Senate.

As the president prepared to make the most sweeping cuts to Medicaid and Medicare in the programs’ histories, a handful of GOP senators initially withheld their support for Trump’s major tax cut and defense spending package until Senate Republican leadership did something to make up for the devastating cuts to health care for low income and elderly Americans, especially those from states with large rural populations. Republican leadership added a provision to the “Big, Beautiful Bill” that created a Rural Health Transformation Fund. The fund directed $50 billion of the $3.4 trillion reconciliation package, or about 1.5% of the bill’s total cost, to rural health initiatives over five years. The first year of payments were announced Monday.\n\nThe first iteration of the $50 billion fund saw all 50 states receive money, with states receiving an average of $200 million, according to a release from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS). \n\nAnd despite concerns that the CMS could use its scoring rubric to disadvantage blue states and benefit states that voted for Trump, initial awards show a seemingly apolitical distribution of funds. \n\nSince half of the fund will be distributed equally among the states, those with smaller populations received more money on average than the most populous states. Five of the top 10 states that received the most money per capita are blue states, with Alaska receiving the most money per capita at $368. That’s key, since Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) was among the most vocal GOP senators expressing concern about how Medicaid cuts would impact her constituents. Maine is also among the top 10 states receiving the most money per capita. Though Kamala Harris won the presidential election there, its GOP Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) was another GOP legislator heavily involved in rural healthcare negotiations last summer.\n\nA TPM analysis using U.S. Census Bureau data on states’ rural populations and rural hospital data from the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform through October 2025 shows:\n\nBlue states on average received a larger share of funding per rural hospital than red states.\n\nRhode Island, which has one rural hospital and an about 10% rural population, received the most money per rural hospital.\n\nCalifornia received the least money per capita, at $6 per resident.\n\nThere is a slight correlation between a state’s rural population and the amount of money the state received per capita.\n\nBefore the program was rolled out, healthcare stakeholders told TPM that its parameters could disadvantage certain states and benefit others. The CMS scoring system distributed the funds based on a complex weighted formula which included a range of partisan policy-based factors, including whether states restrict SNAP users from buying “non-nutritious foods” and whether states plan to require Trump’s “Presidential Fitness Test” in schools. State scores could also be impacted if the state restricts certain health insurance plans, sometimes called junk plans, which don’t comply with Affordable Care Act coverage standards.\n\n“We have an administration which just says right out, ‘We’re gonna cut money to blue states and blue communities,’ and it is doing it,” Adam Searing, an attorney and research professor at the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy, told TPM in November. “If you happen to live in a community that we disagree with politically, too bad.”\n\nWhile initial award amounts suggest nonpartisan fund distribution, there are still concerns about strings attached to the Rural Health Transformation Fund. \n\nSince the funding will be recalculated annually over the life of the five-year program, CMS Administrator Mehmet Oz reportedly said in a call with reporters that the administration could “claw back” funds if a state doesn’t enact policies it committed to in its application. Searing suggested that was a possibility in November, telling TPM that CMS “can do pretty much what they want and the states can’t complain about it.”\n\nThere’s also the issue that the fund hardly covers the day-to-day operations of struggling rural health facilities. Only 15% of the fund’s cash can be used to cover uncompensated care, which experts have said will become a significant issue when health care cuts in the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” hit. None of the money can help supplement underpayment from other insurance sources including private plans. And just 10% of the money can be used to cover administrative costs. The rest of the money must be designated for three or more approved initiatives, including workforce recruitment and retention, support for substance use treatment and mental health services, chronic disease management and prevention, and technology improvements.\n\nAnd ultimately, healthcare experts have told TPM, $50 billion is a drop in the bucket compared to the impending health care cuts and rural hospital deficits. \n\n“It’s $1 trillion in cuts over a decade and $50 billion to help try to shore it up,” Rob Davidson, an emergency physician in rural West Michigan told TPM in July. “That’s 5% of the problem in a 5 year span. That math doesn’t work out.”\n\nIn a statement following the award announcements, the National Rural Health Association, a nonprofit professional organization, applauded the Trump administration and called the funding “unprecedented.” Despite this, the organization’s statement highlighted that the fund is hardly enough. \n\n“While this one-time funding grant is significant,” the statement reads, “NRHA reiterates that long-term policies guaranteeing sustainable funding for rural health care are needed to support providers and maintain access to care.”","summary":"Rural health systems had already been struggling for years when, earlier this year, they became a legislative focus for President...","url":"https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/rural-health-fund-awarded-to-all-50-states-but-trump-admin-can-still-claw-back-cash","image":"https://talkingpointsmemo.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2238333791.jpg?w=2048","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-03 12:00:00","author":"Layla A.

Fire and Fury, Michael Wolff’s tell-all about Trump’s chaotic first year in office, was a monster best seller in 2018, as were his subsequent Trump books in 2019 and 2021. Each volume of Bob Woodward’s three-part chronicle of Trump’s first term (Fear, Rage, and Peril) all reached the top of the New York Times nonfiction list. Insider accounts (such as Unhinged, by Omarosa Manigault Newman, briefly a Trump-administration official), polemics (Triggered, by Donald Trump Jr.), and other journalistic narratives captivated readers, too. All told, during his first term, at least 20 Trump-related books hit the top spot on the Times list.\n\nNow the best-seller lists tell a different story: The Trump-book bubble has burst. This is no doubt partly the result of reader fatigue—there are only so many Trump books any one politics junkie can be expected to buy. But the president himself might be personally undermining the value proposition of books about his favorite subject. During his first term, Trump books promised juicy revelations about behind-the-scenes conflict, offensive comments made in private, and crazy plans narrowly averted. This time around, Trump’s team seems united, his offensive outbursts are made in public, and the crazy plans aren’t averted. There may just be less for the chroniclers to reveal.\n\nWhatever the explanation, the numbers don’t lie. Several solidly reported and well-reviewed volumes on Trump’s interregnum and reelection, such as Meridith McGraw’s Trump in Exile and Alex Isenstadt’s Revenge: The Inside Story of Trump’s Return to Power, didn’t even dent the hardcover-nonfiction list. Another, 2024: How Trump Retook the White House and the Democrats Lost America, by three star politics reporters, briefly flashed onto the Times list before quickly vanishing. Even Wolff is no longer a sure thing. After three previous appearances atop the Times list, his account of the 2024 election, All or Nothing: How Trump Recaptured America, reached only No. 10 upon its debut. It fell off the list after a week and didn’t return.\n\nThe once-reliable subgenre of Trump-the-conqueror volumes, designed to appeal to his base, has also lost its juice. After 10 years of Trump the politician, even readers who were once hungry to learn about the man they’d voted for seem to have had their fill. Newt Gingrich’s Trump’s Triumph lasted only two weeks on the nonfiction chart in June. Despite cable-news attention, The Greatest Comeback Ever, by the Fox News commentator Joe Concha, was a one-week wonder in May. So was the CNN pundit Scott Jennings’s A Revolution of Common Sense, published in November. Eric Trump’s Under Siege: My Family’s Fight to Save Our Nation landed in the top spot in November, but lasted only three weeks on the list. The one certifiable hit has been Melania Trump’s eponymous memoir.\n\n“Coming out cold with a Trump book right now would probably be a tougher sell than it was five years ago,” the ABC News journalist Jonathan Karl told me. “The world is not obsessing about Trump’s actions today the way they were during his first term. Many people have tuned out.” Karl is the author of several best-selling books about the Trump epoch. Despite well-attended promotional appearances, however, his most recent volume—Retribution: Donald Trump and the Campaign That Changed America—lasted only a week on the Times nonfiction list in November.\n\nThe hot topic in political publishing over the past year seems to have been Trump’s 2024 opponents, not Trump—perhaps because readers were more interested in understanding how the Democrats botched things so badly. Original Sin, Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson’s account of Joe Biden’s physical and cognitive decline, was a best seller for much of the summer. Kamala Harris’s memoir about the 2024 election, 107 Days, is still on the chart after three months. No recent book about Trump has approached those numbers.\n\n“These are some really terrific books with important reporting in them, but it just seems like the public is exhausted at the moment,” the New York Times White House reporter Peter Baker told me. “They’re inundated with Trump at every hour of the day, and they may want to use their personal reading time for something more escapist.” Baker and his wife, the New Yorker columnist Susan Glasser, co-wrote The Divider: Trump in the White House 2017–2021, a top-selling title in 2022.\n\nI have had my own encounter with the shifting economics of Trump-focused nonfiction. A proposal I wrote for a Trump-centric book last year was met with utter indifference. One editor responded to my agent with kind words for my pitch, but explained: “We’ve been struggling with books on Trump. I think readers have hit a wall with the relentless coverage of him and his policies. We’re not seeing book sales on this subject so I’m going to pass.”\n\nThat’s not to say there won’t be more to come. Baker, for one, thinks the current lull is temporary. Ultimately, he said, “Trump is such a consequential figure for our society that there’s still a lot of room for future books that capture his role in history.” Indeed, two of Baker’s Times colleagues, Maggie Haberman and Jonathan Swan, are at work on a book focusing on the first year of Trump’s second term. The thing about Trump is that he’s always “too much and never enough,” to quote the title of Mary Trump’s 2020 book about her uncle. It sold more than a million copies.","summary":"A decade into the Trump era, readers who were once hungry to learn about the man seem to have had their fill.","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/trump-book-sales/685442/","image":"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/IWCsjOAIyvksuMBZAZBGFVXAutg=/0x0:2880x1620/720x405/media/img/mt/2025/12/trump_books_horizontal/original.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-03 12:00:00","author":"Paul Farhi","authors":["Paul Farhi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.106},{"id":390880990,"title":"Trump looms over 2026, from war fears to democratic collapse | Opinion","text":"What do you do when 2026 is chugging forward like a freight train, and you know the smartest people in Michigan?\n\nYou ask them a lot of questions about what's going to happen.\n\nFree Press contributing columnists John Lindstrom, Pamela Hilliard Owens, Darren A.

Owens: What’s the biggest choice Americans will make in 2026? ● John Gallagher: What question about Michigan in 2026 keeps you up at night? ● Rusty Hills: What’s our biggest challenge in 2026?\n\nWhat does 2026 hang on? You guessed it: Donald Trump.\n\nWho is the greatest danger in seeing U.S. forces once more fight and die?\n\nPresident Donald Trump.\n\nHis pressure tactics on Venezuela could be considered an act of war, and a type of piracy. Venezuela hasn’t anywhere near the capacity to repulse U.S. forces, but they could inflict serious damage, along with triggering a guerilla war. Plus, as Cuba is vitally tied to Venezuela economically, it too could engage against the U.S., and who is an ally of Cuba? Russia.\n\nThere is Trump’s insulting disregard of Europe and indifference towards NATO. Vladimir Putin has come close to actually striking a NATO ally in his savage war with Ukraine, which would require us, under our treaty, to respond. And there is Trump's moronic determination to seize Iceland, which could involve U.S. troops against a NATO ally (Denmark) which would trigger all other NATO nations to protect Denmark and Iceland ... which would mean fighting us. \n\nThe president’s claim he has brought peace to the Middle East for the first time since Moses destroyed the plates is …interesting. Especially since Israel continues to target Hamas leaders, and one expects Hamas may respond. And then there’s ISIS showing new life in Syria.\n\nIn the 2016 campaign, Trump ― who got himself several draft deferments ― said he loved war. More recently, he has taken claim to stopping at least eight conflicts which he seems to think makes him the logical candidate for the Nobel Peace Prize. Well, with luck, whether Trump wins the Nobel Prize or not, he will not get us into another deadly conflict.\n\n― John Lindstrom\n\nWhat’s the 1 shift that must happen in 2026 for the country to keep functioning? Win the midterms.\n\nIt’s now 2026, and about one year since the second Trump administration came into power.\n\nAs we all know by now, Donald Trump is not interested in governing. Despite all of the promises he made on the 2024 campaign trail, Trump seems to be pursuing two main goals: to stay out of prison, and to make as much money as possible for himself, his family and his wealthy friends.\n\nHe and members of his administration are doing everything possible to destroy our government, including ignoring the Constitution.\n\nI’ve seen many people online lament that we can't survive another three years of this.\n\nRight now, all we have to do is “survive” this year, 2026 ― and set ourselves up to win Congressional majorities in both the U.S. House and the Senate so that, going forward, we will have a functioning government again.\n\nIn 2016, both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton warned that the U.S. Supreme Court majority would depend on the November election results.\n\nWe didn’t listen.\n\nIn 2024, Kamala Harris warned that a Trump electoral win would usher in the destructive Project 2025.\n\nWe didn’t listen.\n\nNow in 2026, there are many Democratic “consultants” who say that the way to win in 2026 is to continue to trend toward the center.\n\nWe shouldn’t listen.\n\nDemocrats lost in 2024 by staying \"safe,” tacking towards the center, and attempting to convert Republicans to Democrats. We cannot continue to count on that losing strategy in 2026.\n\nAs we have seen in most elections or special elections in 2025, Democrats and Democratic Socialists have won their seats, and often flipping them from Republican to Democratic in local, state and national elections.\n\nThere’s an old cliché attributed to Bill Clinton: “Democrats fall in love, while Republicans fall in line.\"\n\nWhile there are now very obvious cracks in the MAGA Republicans' “line” that Democrats can successfully exploit, it’s time for Democrats to fall out of love with the old guard and the usual safe and centrist Democratic candidates.\n\nThe one shift that must happen in 2026 is for the Democrats to stop being safe, and start taking a more progressive offensive stance. It’s time to use the current chaos, and scandals about the Republicans, to show the electorate what Democrats are for, and how those policies will help the electorate, instead of just voting against Republican policies.\n\nWe must continue to win all 2026 state and local elections and regain majorities in Congress. We must shift our thinking and all our efforts to achieve those results. Only then can we take our government back.\n\n― Pamela Hilliard Owens\n\nWhat factor has the potential to reshape 2026? Black women running for the U.S. Senate.\n\nThe one thing in 2026 people should be looking out for nationally are the seven Black women, thus far, who are running for Senate seats.\n\nIf even one is elected, it will mark the first time three Black women would be serving at the same time. Last year, the election of U.S. Sens. Angela Alsobrooks, D-Maryland, and Lisa Blunt, D-Delaware, made them the first pair of African American women to serve together in the hundred-member U.S. Senate.\n\nThe most notable among those running is Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, a U.S. Congresswoman serving in the 30th District since 2023. Crockett, who has drawn national attention from Democratic voters for her quick wit in fiery exchanges during hearings, is seeking to become the first Democrat Texas sends to the Senate in more than 30 years.\n\nWhat’s also of interest is her pledge that the road to flipping Texas blue runs through Harris County. That path is increasing voter turnout in Harris County, home to Houston, the largest county in Texas and a diverse area with 5 million voters.\n\nIllinois U.S. Congresswoman Robin Kelly, D-Illinois, a licensed mental health counselor, has served the state’s 2nd District since 2013. Kelly ran after organizing the community around gun violence after the Sandy Hook shooting that killed 26 people. Kelly also led a sit-in on the Illinois state House Floor to protest inaction on gun violence, and co-sponsored legislation protecting victims of domestic violence.\n\nHer U.S. Senate platform includes making Illinois safe from crime and gun violence, making everyday costs lower for families and improving health inequalities.\n\nDemocratic Illinois Lt. Governor Juliana Stratton is also seeking to win the seat that’s open with Dick Durbin’s retirement. Durbin is the U.S. Senate Democratic Whip. Her priorities are making life more affordable for Illinois families and creating more opportunities for the middle class.\n\nIf either Kelly or Stratton win, she would become the second Black Illinois woman to serve in the Senate, following Carol Moseley Braun in 1992.\n\nKentucky General Assembly representative and House Minority Floor Leader Pamela Stevenson, a Democrat, is running for the seat left vacant with Mitch McConnell’s retirement after eight terms. Stevenson, a retired U.S. Air Force Colonel, boasts that she’s the only member to break through to Republican leadership holding the super majority in the state. Kentucky has never elected a Black or woman representative.\n\nCatherine Fleming Bruce of South Carolina, an author and community activist, is running for the seat held by Republican U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham.\n\n“This is what my candidacy offers to you: My pledge that I will continue the work of fighting corrupt systems, ensuring that the federal support needed by our governor, our state legislators and municipal officers will be there,” Fleming Bruce said. “My past commitments and work I’ve done are proof of my present intention.”\n\nIf elected, she would become South Carolina’s first Black woman and second Black Senator, following Tim Scott, R-South Carolina.\n\nPriscilla Williams-Till, a distant cousin of Emmett Till, is running for a Senate seat in Mississippi. Emmett Till of Chicago was 14 when he was lynched after being accused of whistling at white woman, Carolyn Bryant, in 1955. It galvanized the Civil Rights Movement.\n\nWilliams-Till will focus on rebuilding from the ground up by making sure every family has access to health care, a quality education and clean water. She will take on Republican U.S. Senate incumbent Cindy Hyde-Smith.\n\nN’Kiyla \"Jasmine\" Thomas is in a crowded primary election seeking to unseat Markwayne Mullin, R-Oklahoma. Her platform includes improving education, accessible health care, supporting working families and helping immigrants, who brings in $3 billion to the Oklahoma economy. The state has never had a Black senator.\n\nSeveral others may declare before the filing deadline in each state.\n\nThis upcoming year could very well be historic, so get your popcorn ready.\n\n― Darren A. Nichols\n\nWhat’s the biggest choice Americans will make in 2026? Whether or not we're worth saving.\n\nThe biggest challenge Americans will face in 2026 is actively deciding whether America as we know it is worth saving, and what each of us is willing to do.\n\nWhen I say \"actively\" deciding, I mean that making this decision cannot be a passive “yeah, sure, OK” kind of decision. Saving democracy is not an armchair sport. It’s not something you can do in your easy chair, sipping a beer, watching the rest of your neighbors march off to man the barricades on TV. Each of us has to actually do something for this to work.\n\nSome of us can do a lot, others not as much, but for those of us who are willing to recognize that we’re in a bit of trouble ― like maybe the worst trouble we have been in as a nation since any of us were born ― it’s past time to assess your democracy saving skills and put them to work. Write to your senator or representative. Participate in a rally. Donate. Engage with a neighbor or relative.\n\nI want to emphasize that participating in a saving-democracy activity does not require that we all must love each other, or even like each other all that much. Not a requirement. No need to sing \"We Are the World,\" \"Kumbaya,\" or \"We Shall Overcome.\" We are allowed to get on each other’s nerves, and that’s fine.\n\nAnyone who has studied the civil rights movement knows that this was not a movement of buddies and friends who all got along famously. They fought, oftentimes furiously, and disagreed on tactics and strategies, loudly and often. But the one thing that kept them together was an unwavering commitment to obtaining equal rights for Black Americans, and abolishing segregation and discrimination.\n\nSo sometimes friction is a good thing, because you don’t get friction without action, and action is what we need in 2026.\n\nThe point here is establishing priorities, and priorities can better be established when we realize what’s at stake. Because once we can all agree on what is at stake, then we can overlook the comparatively petty grievances that divide us, and unite on the Really Big Priority of saving this country and future generations from autocracy and fascism.\n\nWouldn’t that be nice?\n\n― Keith A. Owens\n\nWhat question about Michigan in 2026 keeps you up at night? If you can read this, you may be part of the solution.\n\nThe warning signs are everywhere. Kids don’t read books anymore. Well under half of Michigan students are not proficient in reading. Literacy rates dropped alarmingly during the COVID-19 pandemic and are yet to recover.\n\nAdd to those trends the devastation of the newspaper industry, with numerous papers closing across the country or drastically cutting back, and the writing is on the wall even if fewer people can read it.\n\nThe ability to read and comprehend complex material remains essential to a functioning democratic society. And we seem to be losing that ability as a state and a nation.\n\nTo understand a political speech; to discern sensible arguments from nut-case stuff; the basic knowledge to navigate our ever-changing society ― all these are mastered through reading skills. And the decline of reading in America worries me to no end.\n\nSocial media gets a lot of blame. Kids who spend their hours on TikTok, who ask ChatGPT to write their essays, are learning that brief snippets of knowledge are all they need to get by. Not for nothing has Australia banned social media for kids under 16. Other nations are watching closely and may try to follow, although the effectiveness of the ban is in doubt.\n\nI have spent part of my retirement tutoring second- and third-grade kids in Detroit Public Schools Community District in a reading program. Some of the students come well prepared, knowing their letters and already able to read, somewhat. But others have never been exposed to books in their formative years and remain at least a grade or two behind, even by age eight.\n\nI fear that reading skills are becoming a perk of the few rather than the inheritance of everyone. That could take us one more step on the road to oligarchy, where the privileged have power and everyone else suffers.\n\nThe decline of literacy in America is not the only problem we face. But it underlies so many others. \n\n― John Gallagher\n\nWhat’s our biggest challenge in 2026?\n\nThe biggest challenge facing America is not China. Or Russia. It is not our lack of rare earth metals. Or the loss of manufacturing jobs throughout Michigan and the Midwest.\n\nNo, the greatest challenge we face, in America, and right here in Michigan, is a lack of moral courage.\n\nRecently, revered film director Rob Reiner and his lovely wife Michele were tragically murdered. President Donald Trump responded with a churlish, baseless and mean-spirited screed on social media. Not just in shockingly bad taste, but spiteful and hurtful to a grieving family.\n\nI was reminded of Wisconsin U.S. Sen. Joe McCarthy who, in the 1950s, began hurling wild accusations of Communist infiltration in the State Department, numerous federal agencies, and, ultimately, the U.S. Army. McCarthy’s witch hunts continued for years until he was finally confronted by a lawyer named Joseph Welch.\n\nAs McCarthy sought to attack a young lawyer, Welch replied: “Until this moment, Senator, I think I never really gauged your cruelty or your recklessness.” When McCarthy sought to interrupt, Welch concluded with this famous line: “You have done enough. Have you no sense of decency?”\n\nEvery Republican should have used those same lines with regard to President Trump. “Have you no sense of decency?” Credit to Republican U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Kentucky, and a handful of others, who did call out the president’s remarks. But far too many in the GOP have remained silent, too cowed or afraid to speak truth to power. Where is the moral courage needed for this moment?\n\nThe Democrats have their own issues to tackle. When Joe Biden ran for president in 2020, he suggested he would be a bridge to a different future. But then, having won the White House, Biden decided he and he alone could win in 2024. Every Democrat in leadership ― Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, Hakeem Jeffries ― knew that Joe Biden had diminished capacity, that he was not able to run again, let alone serve four more years in the White House.\n\nYet, when an obscure backbench congressman from Minnesota, Dean Phillips, urged fellow Democrats to challenge President Biden, Phillips was ostracized and dismissed as a crank. Dean Phillips’ words proved true. And for his truthfulness, he was forced to give up his congressional seat. The Democrats paid the ultimate price for their refusal to acknowledge the truth, by fumbling their opportunity and losing the White House. All because no Democrat had the courage to tell the president he was no longer up for the job.\n\nContrast that with the example of Bobby Kennedy in 1968. Upset by the stalemated war in Vietnam, Kennedy could no longer sit on the sidelines. So he announced that he would challenge the incumbent president of the United States, Lyndon B. Johnson. \n\nIn remarks in Los Angeles, Kennedy explained why he was running: “We do not know where we are going. We have been stripped of goals and values and direction, as we move aimlessly and rather futilely from crisis to crisis and danger to danger. And the record shows that kind of approach will not only not solve problems, it will only deepen them.\n\n\"This is not simply the result of bad policies and lack of skill. It flows from the fact that for almost the first time the national leadership is calling upon the darker impulses of the American spirit ... an example where integrity, truth, honor and all the rest seem like words to fill out speeches rather than guiding beliefs. ... I hope to offer you a way in which the people themselves can lead the way back to those ideals which are the source of national strength and generosity and compassion of deed.”\n\nThis was the courage that Democrats lacked in 2024, and for which they paid dearly.\n\nMichigan’s only president, Gerald Ford, earned his Profile in Courage award when he pardoned former President Richard Nixon. Not because Ford thought Nixon was innocent. But because rather than fixate on Nixon’s past, Ford was focused on America’s future. Because Jerry Ford understood America needed to stop wallowing in Watergate, and start solving the problems confronting our nation at home and abroad.Ford lost his election in 1976. But he did right by America.\n\nHere are the words of Jerry Ford at the groundbreaking for Weill Hall, where the Ford School of Public Policy now resides: “The ultimate test of leadership is not the polls you take, but the risks you take. In the short run, some risks prove overwhelming. Political courage can, for the moment, be self-defeating. But the greatest risk of all would be to live without courage ― for that would hardly be living at all.”\n\nOur politics need the courage of Joseph Welch, Bobby Kennedy and Gerald Ford.

Nichols, Keith A. Owens, John Gallagher and Rusty Hills weighed in on a range of questions about the factors and forces that will shape Michigan and the U.S. in 2026 and beyond, sharing frank estimations of the challenges facing our state and nation ― and even offering us hope.\n\nRead what our columnists had to say, and tell us how you're feeling about 2026 in a letter to the editor at freep.com/letters.\n\n― Nancy Kaffer, editorial page editor\n\nJohn Lindstrom: What does 2026 hang on? ● Pamela Hilliard Owens: What’s the 1 shift that must happen in 2026 for the country to keep functioning? ● Darren A. Nichols: What factor has the potential to reshape 2026? ● Keith A. Owens: What’s the biggest choice Americans will make in 2026? ● John Gallagher: What question about Michigan in 2026 keeps you up at night? ● Rusty Hills: What’s our biggest challenge in 2026?\n\nWhat does 2026 hang on? You guessed it: Donald Trump.\n\nWho is the greatest danger in seeing U.S. forces once more fight and die?\n\nPresident Donald Trump.\n\nHis pressure tactics on Venezuela could be considered an act of war, and a type of piracy. Venezuela hasn’t anywhere near the capacity to repulse U.S. forces, but they could inflict serious damage, along with triggering a guerilla war. Plus, as Cuba is vitally tied to Venezuela economically, it too could engage against the U.S., and who is an ally of Cuba? Russia.\n\nThere is Trump’s insulting disregard of Europe and indifference towards NATO. Vladimir Putin has come close to actually striking a NATO ally in his savage war with Ukraine, which would require us, under our treaty, to respond. And there is Trump's moronic determination to seize Iceland, which could involve U.S. troops against a NATO ally (Denmark) which would trigger all other NATO nations to protect Denmark and Iceland ... which would mean fighting us. \n\nThe president’s claim he has brought peace to the Middle East for the first time since Moses destroyed the plates is …interesting. Especially since Israel continues to target Hamas leaders, and one expects Hamas may respond. And then there’s ISIS showing new life in Syria.\n\nIn the 2016 campaign, Trump ― who got himself several draft deferments ― said he loved war. More recently, he has taken claim to stopping at least eight conflicts which he seems to think makes him the logical candidate for the Nobel Peace Prize. Well, with luck, whether Trump wins the Nobel Prize or not, he will not get us into another deadly conflict.\n\n― John Lindstrom\n\nWhat’s the 1 shift that must happen in 2026 for the country to keep functioning? Win the midterms.\n\nIt’s now 2026, and about one year since the second Trump administration came into power.\n\nAs we all know by now, Donald Trump is not interested in governing. Despite all of the promises he made on the 2024 campaign trail, Trump seems to be pursuing two main goals: to stay out of prison, and to make as much money as possible for himself, his family and his wealthy friends.\n\nHe and members of his administration are doing everything possible to destroy our government, including ignoring the Constitution.\n\nI’ve seen many people online lament that we can't survive another three years of this.\n\nRight now, all we have to do is “survive” this year, 2026 ― and set ourselves up to win Congressional majorities in both the U.S. House and the Senate so that, going forward, we will have a functioning government again.\n\nIn 2016, both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton warned that the U.S. Supreme Court majority would depend on the November election results.\n\nWe didn’t listen.\n\nIn 2024, Kamala Harris warned that a Trump electoral win would usher in the destructive Project 2025.\n\nWe didn’t listen.\n\nNow in 2026, there are many Democratic “consultants” who say that the way to win in 2026 is to continue to trend toward the center.\n\nWe shouldn’t listen.\n\nDemocrats lost in 2024 by staying \"safe,” tacking towards the center, and attempting to convert Republicans to Democrats. We cannot continue to count on that losing strategy in 2026.\n\nAs we have seen in most elections or special elections in 2025, Democrats and Democratic Socialists have won their seats, and often flipping them from Republican to Democratic in local, state and national elections.\n\nThere’s an old cliché attributed to Bill Clinton: “Democrats fall in love, while Republicans fall in line.\"\n\nWhile there are now very obvious cracks in the MAGA Republicans' “line” that Democrats can successfully exploit, it’s time for Democrats to fall out of love with the old guard and the usual safe and centrist Democratic candidates.\n\nThe one shift that must happen in 2026 is for the Democrats to stop being safe, and start taking a more progressive offensive stance. It’s time to use the current chaos, and scandals about the Republicans, to show the electorate what Democrats are for, and how those policies will help the electorate, instead of just voting against Republican policies.\n\nWe must continue to win all 2026 state and local elections and regain majorities in Congress. We must shift our thinking and all our efforts to achieve those results. Only then can we take our government back.\n\n― Pamela Hilliard Owens\n\nWhat factor has the potential to reshape 2026? Black women running for the U.S. Senate.\n\nThe one thing in 2026 people should be looking out for nationally are the seven Black women, thus far, who are running for Senate seats.\n\nIf even one is elected, it will mark the first time three Black women would be serving at the same time. Last year, the election of U.S. Sens. Angela Alsobrooks, D-Maryland, and Lisa Blunt, D-Delaware, made them the first pair of African American women to serve together in the hundred-member U.S. Senate.\n\nThe most notable among those running is Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, a U.S. Congresswoman serving in the 30th District since 2023. Crockett, who has drawn national attention from Democratic voters for her quick wit in fiery exchanges during hearings, is seeking to become the first Democrat Texas sends to the Senate in more than 30 years.\n\nWhat’s also of interest is her pledge that the road to flipping Texas blue runs through Harris County. That path is increasing voter turnout in Harris County, home to Houston, the largest county in Texas and a diverse area with 5 million voters.\n\nIllinois U.S. Congresswoman Robin Kelly, D-Illinois, a licensed mental health counselor, has served the state’s 2nd District since 2013. Kelly ran after organizing the community around gun violence after the Sandy Hook shooting that killed 26 people. Kelly also led a sit-in on the Illinois state House Floor to protest inaction on gun violence, and co-sponsored legislation protecting victims of domestic violence.\n\nHer U.S. Senate platform includes making Illinois safe from crime and gun violence, making everyday costs lower for families and improving health inequalities.\n\nDemocratic Illinois Lt. Governor Juliana Stratton is also seeking to win the seat that’s open with Dick Durbin’s retirement. Durbin is the U.S. Senate Democratic Whip. Her priorities are making life more affordable for Illinois families and creating more opportunities for the middle class.\n\nIf either Kelly or Stratton win, she would become the second Black Illinois woman to serve in the Senate, following Carol Moseley Braun in 1992.\n\nKentucky General Assembly representative and House Minority Floor Leader Pamela Stevenson, a Democrat, is running for the seat left vacant with Mitch McConnell’s retirement after eight terms. Stevenson, a retired U.S. Air Force Colonel, boasts that she’s the only member to break through to Republican leadership holding the super majority in the state. Kentucky has never elected a Black or woman representative.\n\nCatherine Fleming Bruce of South Carolina, an author and community activist, is running for the seat held by Republican U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham.\n\n“This is what my candidacy offers to you: My pledge that I will continue the work of fighting corrupt systems, ensuring that the federal support needed by our governor, our state legislators and municipal officers will be there,” Fleming Bruce said. “My past commitments and work I’ve done are proof of my present intention.”\n\nIf elected, she would become South Carolina’s first Black woman and second Black Senator, following Tim Scott, R-South Carolina.\n\nPriscilla Williams-Till, a distant cousin of Emmett Till, is running for a Senate seat in Mississippi. Emmett Till of Chicago was 14 when he was lynched after being accused of whistling at white woman, Carolyn Bryant, in 1955. It galvanized the Civil Rights Movement.\n\nWilliams-Till will focus on rebuilding from the ground up by making sure every family has access to health care, a quality education and clean water. She will take on Republican U.S. Senate incumbent Cindy Hyde-Smith.\n\nN’Kiyla \"Jasmine\" Thomas is in a crowded primary election seeking to unseat Markwayne Mullin, R-Oklahoma. Her platform includes improving education, accessible health care, supporting working families and helping immigrants, who brings in $3 billion to the Oklahoma economy. The state has never had a Black senator.\n\nSeveral others may declare before the filing deadline in each state.\n\nThis upcoming year could very well be historic, so get your popcorn ready.\n\n― Darren A. Nichols\n\nWhat’s the biggest choice Americans will make in 2026? Whether or not we're worth saving.\n\nThe biggest challenge Americans will face in 2026 is actively deciding whether America as we know it is worth saving, and what each of us is willing to do.\n\nWhen I say \"actively\" deciding, I mean that making this decision cannot be a passive “yeah, sure, OK” kind of decision. Saving democracy is not an armchair sport. It’s not something you can do in your easy chair, sipping a beer, watching the rest of your neighbors march off to man the barricades on TV. Each of us has to actually do something for this to work.\n\nSome of us can do a lot, others not as much, but for those of us who are willing to recognize that we’re in a bit of trouble ― like maybe the worst trouble we have been in as a nation since any of us were born ― it’s past time to assess your democracy saving skills and put them to work. Write to your senator or representative. Participate in a rally. Donate. Engage with a neighbor or relative.\n\nI want to emphasize that participating in a saving-democracy activity does not require that we all must love each other, or even like each other all that much. Not a requirement. No need to sing \"We Are the World,\" \"Kumbaya,\" or \"We Shall Overcome.\" We are allowed to get on each other’s nerves, and that’s fine.\n\nAnyone who has studied the civil rights movement knows that this was not a movement of buddies and friends who all got along famously. They fought, oftentimes furiously, and disagreed on tactics and strategies, loudly and often. But the one thing that kept them together was an unwavering commitment to obtaining equal rights for Black Americans, and abolishing segregation and discrimination.\n\nSo sometimes friction is a good thing, because you don’t get friction without action, and action is what we need in 2026.\n\nThe point here is establishing priorities, and priorities can better be established when we realize what’s at stake. Because once we can all agree on what is at stake, then we can overlook the comparatively petty grievances that divide us, and unite on the Really Big Priority of saving this country and future generations from autocracy and fascism.\n\nWouldn’t that be nice?\n\n― Keith A. Owens\n\nWhat question about Michigan in 2026 keeps you up at night? If you can read this, you may be part of the solution.\n\nThe warning signs are everywhere. Kids don’t read books anymore. Well under half of Michigan students are not proficient in reading. Literacy rates dropped alarmingly during the COVID-19 pandemic and are yet to recover.\n\nAdd to those trends the devastation of the newspaper industry, with numerous papers closing across the country or drastically cutting back, and the writing is on the wall even if fewer people can read it.\n\nThe ability to read and comprehend complex material remains essential to a functioning democratic society. And we seem to be losing that ability as a state and a nation.\n\nTo understand a political speech; to discern sensible arguments from nut-case stuff; the basic knowledge to navigate our ever-changing society ― all these are mastered through reading skills. And the decline of reading in America worries me to no end.\n\nSocial media gets a lot of blame. Kids who spend their hours on TikTok, who ask ChatGPT to write their essays, are learning that brief snippets of knowledge are all they need to get by. Not for nothing has Australia banned social media for kids under 16. Other nations are watching closely and may try to follow, although the effectiveness of the ban is in doubt.\n\nI have spent part of my retirement tutoring second- and third-grade kids in Detroit Public Schools Community District in a reading program. Some of the students come well prepared, knowing their letters and already able to read, somewhat. But others have never been exposed to books in their formative years and remain at least a grade or two behind, even by age eight.\n\nI fear that reading skills are becoming a perk of the few rather than the inheritance of everyone. That could take us one more step on the road to oligarchy, where the privileged have power and everyone else suffers.\n\nThe decline of literacy in America is not the only problem we face. But it underlies so many others. \n\n― John Gallagher\n\nWhat’s our biggest challenge in 2026?\n\nThe biggest challenge facing America is not China. Or Russia. It is not our lack of rare earth metals. Or the loss of manufacturing jobs throughout Michigan and the Midwest.\n\nNo, the greatest challenge we face, in America, and right here in Michigan, is a lack of moral courage.\n\nRecently, revered film director Rob Reiner and his lovely wife Michele were tragically murdered. President Donald Trump responded with a churlish, baseless and mean-spirited screed on social media. Not just in shockingly bad taste, but spiteful and hurtful to a grieving family.\n\nI was reminded of Wisconsin U.S. Sen. Joe McCarthy who, in the 1950s, began hurling wild accusations of Communist infiltration in the State Department, numerous federal agencies, and, ultimately, the U.S. Army. McCarthy’s witch hunts continued for years until he was finally confronted by a lawyer named Joseph Welch.\n\nAs McCarthy sought to attack a young lawyer, Welch replied: “Until this moment, Senator, I think I never really gauged your cruelty or your recklessness.” When McCarthy sought to interrupt, Welch concluded with this famous line: “You have done enough. Have you no sense of decency?”\n\nEvery Republican should have used those same lines with regard to President Trump. “Have you no sense of decency?” Credit to Republican U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Kentucky, and a handful of others, who did call out the president’s remarks. But far too many in the GOP have remained silent, too cowed or afraid to speak truth to power. Where is the moral courage needed for this moment?\n\nThe Democrats have their own issues to tackle. When Joe Biden ran for president in 2020, he suggested he would be a bridge to a different future. But then, having won the White House, Biden decided he and he alone could win in 2024. Every Democrat in leadership ― Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, Hakeem Jeffries ― knew that Joe Biden had diminished capacity, that he was not able to run again, let alone serve four more years in the White House.\n\nYet, when an obscure backbench congressman from Minnesota, Dean Phillips, urged fellow Democrats to challenge President Biden, Phillips was ostracized and dismissed as a crank. Dean Phillips’ words proved true. And for his truthfulness, he was forced to give up his congressional seat. The Democrats paid the ultimate price for their refusal to acknowledge the truth, by fumbling their opportunity and losing the White House. All because no Democrat had the courage to tell the president he was no longer up for the job.\n\nContrast that with the example of Bobby Kennedy in 1968. Upset by the stalemated war in Vietnam, Kennedy could no longer sit on the sidelines. So he announced that he would challenge the incumbent president of the United States, Lyndon B. Johnson. \n\nIn remarks in Los Angeles, Kennedy explained why he was running: “We do not know where we are going. We have been stripped of goals and values and direction, as we move aimlessly and rather futilely from crisis to crisis and danger to danger. And the record shows that kind of approach will not only not solve problems, it will only deepen them.\n\n\"This is not simply the result of bad policies and lack of skill. It flows from the fact that for almost the first time the national leadership is calling upon the darker impulses of the American spirit ... an example where integrity, truth, honor and all the rest seem like words to fill out speeches rather than guiding beliefs. ... I hope to offer you a way in which the people themselves can lead the way back to those ideals which are the source of national strength and generosity and compassion of deed.”\n\nThis was the courage that Democrats lacked in 2024, and for which they paid dearly.\n\nMichigan’s only president, Gerald Ford, earned his Profile in Courage award when he pardoned former President Richard Nixon. Not because Ford thought Nixon was innocent. But because rather than fixate on Nixon’s past, Ford was focused on America’s future. Because Jerry Ford understood America needed to stop wallowing in Watergate, and start solving the problems confronting our nation at home and abroad.Ford lost his election in 1976. But he did right by America.\n\nHere are the words of Jerry Ford at the groundbreaking for Weill Hall, where the Ford School of Public Policy now resides: “The ultimate test of leadership is not the polls you take, but the risks you take. In the short run, some risks prove overwhelming. Political courage can, for the moment, be self-defeating. But the greatest risk of all would be to live without courage ― for that would hardly be living at all.”\n\nOur politics need the courage of Joseph Welch, Bobby Kennedy and Gerald Ford. Now more than ever.\n\n― Rusty Hills\n\nSubmit a letter to the editor at freep.com/letters, and we may publish it online and in print ― or just use the form below","summary":"Trump looms over 2026, from war fears to democratic collapse | Opinion  Detroit Free Press","url":"https://www.freep.com/story/opinion/2026/01/03/trump-2026-from-war-democratic-collapse-midterms-literacy/87853886007/","image":"https://www.freep.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/09/PDTF/87186622007-2245387021.jpg?crop=6180,3476,x0,y322&width=1600&height=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-03 11:01:00","author":"Republican U.s.

A Hill report published this week highlights how, even amid growing discontent with Donald Trump’s second term, Democrats continue to struggle with deep divisions, conflicting ideological strategies, and questions about leadership — raising serious concerns about their ability to coalesce ahead of the next presidential cycle.\n\n“Democrats are finding their way out of political wilderness,” noted Democratic strategist Sawyer Hackett, “but I don’t think we should mistake this for Democrats becoming, overnight, a lot more popular, or having fixed the tremendous failures that got us into this position.” Democratic strategist Michael Ceraso added, “I’m not quite sure if there’s a message that Democrats have proposed and driven that’s created the results we saw in November.”\n\nThe Hill report emphasized that Democrats entered 2025 in a state of confusion and infighting after their 2024 defeat. Donors were angry, leaders were divided on messaging, and primary disputes within the Democratic National Committee added to the chaos. Progressive candidate and former House hopeful Cheyenne Hunt described the first half of 2025 as marked by “a party deeply in confusion and disarray.”\n\nWhile some on the left see recent electoral outcomes, such as victories by progressive candidates like Zohran Mamdani in New York City, as a sign of rising support for left-wing policies, others within the party are pushing back. Matt Bennett of the center-left think tank Third Way warned that mimicking New York’s progressive model could backfire in swing states, arguing that “sensible moderates” were rewarded in 2025, and the trend is likely to continue in 2026.\n\nThose strategic debates mirror broader signs of disunity. A Saint Anselm College poll in New Hampshire revealed a fractured 2028 Democratic primary field, with no candidate commanding majority support. Pete Buttigieg leads with 28 percent, followed by Gavin Newsom at 24 percent. Kamala Harris, once seen as a likely successor to Joe Biden, is mired in single digits. In contrast, Republicans appear increasingly consolidated around Vice President JD Vance, who leads the GOP field with 57 percent support.\n\nJulian Epstein, a former Democratic House counsel, told Fox News last month that the party remains out of step with most voters, blaming its continued embrace of “welfare state and identity politics” for sagging approval numbers. He contended that while 70 percent of Americans are moderate or conservative, Democrats have allowed progressives — who represent a much smaller share of the electorate — to dominate the party’s direction.\n\nChuck Todd, formerly of NBC’s Meet the Press, echoed this assessment, stating on CNN that Joe Biden’s single term “did a ton of damage to the Democratic brand” and set the party back among independents and centrists. He maintained that Democrats will likely find more success running against Trump than campaigning on their own policy platform, which he said, “doesn’t have credibility with the voters.”\n\nThe divisions within the Democratic Party are not merely ideological — they also stem from growing frustrations over transparency and internal accountability. One flashpoint is the Democratic National Committee’s refusal to release its long-awaited autopsy of the 2024 election, a decision that has fueled discontent among strategists and activists seeking clarity about the party’s missteps.\n\n “The Democratic Party still has not learned its lessons from the past,” said strategist Sawyer Hackett. “We’re finding a ton of success in the era of Trump because of how chaotic and corrupt and incompetent he is. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that we’ve found our way out of the many failures that our party had in the last election.”\n\nAdding to the controversy is the late 2025 House rebuke of Rep. Jesús “Chuy” García over a maneuver that positioned his chief of staff as the only Democrat on the 2026 primary ballot in Illinois’ 4th District. The bipartisan reprimand, backed by 23 Democrats, centered on concerns that the move undermined the process of a free and fair election.\n\nBreitbart News has covered voter realignment in key states. In Pennsylvania, for instance, Democrats have seen their once-dominant registration lead shrink to under 50,000 — a drastic decline from over 900,000 in 2016. The GOP recently netted over 12,000 new registrations in a single week, signaling continued erosion of Democratic support even in traditionally blue-leaning areas.\n\nWhile Democrats attempt to rally around tangible local issues — such as Abigail Spanberger’s Virginia jobs plan or Mamdani’s push for free public buses — there remains no consensus on a national message. Ceraso observed that the current momentum “may not have come from a message Democrats have proposed and driven,” and warned that party leaders must “be very, very careful … to not have any sense of hubris.”\n\nThis sentiment is echoed by voices on the campaign trail. Axios has noted that several Democratic candidates are calling out national leaders for their passive posture toward Trump’s presidency. Kat Abughazaleh, an Illinois progressive, stated the party must “show the people that you’re angry” and take action, while Texas candidate Jolanda Jones insisted, “If they go low, I’m going to the gutter.”\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans continue to leverage gains in economic messaging and cultural issues. Trump’s policies in states like Pennsylvania — advancing job growth, investment, and executive orders on topics like women’s sports — have contributed to improving approval numbers. A December Harvard‑Harris survey shows Trump leading former President Joe Biden on several key issues — 51 percent approve of his handling of crime, 49 percent approve on immigration, and 48 percent approve on reducing the cost of government.\n\nLooking ahead to 2028, Democrats remain without a frontrunner, a unified message, or a clear direction. Party figures agree that building coherence will be essential, but the path there remains uncertain. “We will need a unified message going into ’28,” remarked Bennett. “And inevitably, parties don’t cohere around such a message until they move towards having a nominee.”","summary":"Democrats face persistent internal discord, unresolved strategic debates, and voter skepticism that threatens to complicate their path toward unity and success in the 2028 presidential election.\n\n\nThe post Democrats Begin New Year Facing Persistent Disarray Ahead of 2028 appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2026/01/02/democrats-new-year-facing-persistent-disarray-2028/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2026/01/Dec3-Chuck-Schumer-Hakeem-Jeffries-democrats-2025-getty-640x335.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-03 06:12:15","author":"Jasmyn Jordan","authors":["Jasmyn Jordan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.06},{"id":390951114,"title":"Who Is Responsible for All This Fraud?","text":"That said, I’m also starting to think we need to not make Tim Walz the scapegoat. Yeah, I know, it’s his state, he’s got the big chair, he’s running the place. By all means, let’s see a little handcuff therapy applied. But was he running the place? Was he really? The sheer scale of this thing has me wondering about that. There's a good deal more going on here.You will recall he was the VP nominee on Kamala Harris’ ticket. I have always held that the sole purpose of most VP candidates is to make the top of the ticket good, smart by comparison. I give you Obama’s VP pick of Joe Biden, and Biden’s VP pick, Harris, as a couple of glaring examples. Since Walz was Harris’s choice (or whoever it was that actually made that choice), it gives us a downward spiral in the evident smarts of Democrat VP candidates. The trend is again, undeniable.From what I’ve seen of Walz in public appearances and what I see on his record, Walz is simply not smart enough to do all of what I see here, on his own, nor does he appear to have the stones to be acting out like this without direction. I doubt I'll get much argument on that point. So, frankly, I have doubts about gross negligence being the primary driver here. All that remains, I'm afraid, is complicity. But who is it he's being complicit with? \n\nI mean, the question becomes, who is the actual director of all this? Who is pulling the strings? Yeah, I know I’m going to be hit with chuckles and charges of being a conspiracy theorist, but frankly, my dear, How else are we to read the evidence in front of us? It’s a question I think we should be asking, given the sheer size of this thing, which seems to be growing by the hour. I’ve been watching the reports on this thing, as have a lot of us, for the past few days, and every report I open brings up more fraud, more people involved, and more tax money stolen. It’s non-stop. This rabbit hole seems bottomless.\n\nOne of the bigger reveals showed up on my desk yesterday afternoon from Libs of TikTok:\n\nMinnesota judge John Guthmann needs to be investigated @FBI @FBIDirectorKash pic.twitter.com/q4639Urfhm— BlueyAnon (@BlueyAnon) January 2, 2026\n\nAnd it's not like they didn't understand what was happening.

And it goes back further than 2018. pic.twitter.com/ErzTxgRu9p— RunTheStairs (@runthestairs) January 2, 2026\n\nThis is well beyond RICO level, people. \n\nLet's imagine that the press had actually dug into this situation (Yeah, I know, fat chance, but go with me on this for a minute). Do you think that might have affected the most recent presidential election? Harris/Walz would have gone down in an even bigger fireball than they did. And that's exactly what would have gone down had Walz's name had an (R) after it. We'd still be hearing about it. This leaves us at the unquestionable conclusion of complicity in this fraud on the part of the press. \n\nAnd let's look closely at the actions of government that would explain a lot of this:\n\nTwo Somali sisters living next door to each other in tax-payer funded housing can make $387,000 per annum by looking after each other's 4 children.

I mean, Okay, they're escaping the constant civil war down there. I get that, at least on the surface.But why there? Snow, which Minnesota is arguably well known for, is not something that is nearly as prevalent in Mogadishu, at least the last time I checked. One would think, say, Arizona would be a more likely place. New Mexico, perhaps.

All of which we now have in that winter wonderland that is Minnesota, by virtue of our toxic compassion.\n\nCome to think of it, this might be a question asked of Walz, come Feb 10, which is when he's scheduled to appear before Jim Comer's Oversight Committee. If Comer is the guy I think he is, he will. Before that happens, however, we're going to see MN State reps before his committee on the 7th of this month. \n\nAnd yes, there are more locations where Somalis have gathered after being shipped into the country with little to no vetting, but as the White House has told us, this is the first of many locations that will be exposed. \n\nAs to how all this affects the rest of us, consider the question: How much of the debt carried by the federal government is from these kinds of fraud? And for a bonus, how much does this affect YOUR bottom line come next April?\n\nAnd the demand from HHS to the State of Minnesota for justifications for childcare payments after the administration paused those payments?

It occurred almost a year ago today, on January 20, 2025, at a Washington, D.C. rally celebrating Donald Trump’s inauguration to his second stint in office.\n\nAn enthusiastic Musk stuck his arm out in a straight line for a mere second – and the world went wild. “I never imagined we would see the day when what appears to be a Heil Hitler salute would be made behind the Presidential seal,” wrote thankfully retiring Rep. Jerry Nadler (NY-15) on social media. “80 Years After Auschwitz, Elon Musk Keeps the Fascist Salute Alive,” read a Newsweek opinion piece headline. Not to be left out, the Associated Press jumped in with, “Musk’s straight-arm gesture embraced by right-wing extremists regardless of what he meant.”\n\nBut guess who also has used that gesture on more than one occasion? You got it — newly minted NYC democratic socialist Mayor Zohran Mamdani. \n\nDoes the corrupt, lying mainstream press care? Of course not. He’s a progressive; he can do what he wants.\n\nNot surprisingly, disgraced Minnesota Gov. Walz had joined in on the Elon feeding frenzy:\n\nLiberals and critics frequently attacked Trump while he was on the campaign trail by calling him a Hitler-esque fascist, including former Vice President Kamala Harris, who compared Trump to the German dictator during a town hall in the final stretch of the 2024 election cycle. Musk attended Trump's inaugural parade in 2025, where he spoke to supporters and was accused of giving a Hitler-style salute to the crowds — a narrative that was promoted by Democrats such as Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. \n\nRedState Remembers: CNN and PBS Help Spread New Hoax Against Elon Musk - It's As Ridiculous As You Would Think\n\nMedia Suffers Another Embarrassment as Even the ADL Defends Elon Musk Over 'Fascist Salute' Accusations\n\nMusk himself noticed the glaring hypocrisy:\n\nMusk had previously addressed the sustained “Nazi” fascist attacks that he and most others in Trumpworld have sustained. It’s pure propaganda, he said:\n\n\"Well, I mean, look, it’s a relentless propaganda campaign, which obviously President Trump has experienced for a very long time, 20 years, maybe longer,\" Musk said on Fox News' \"My View with Lara Trump\" in May. \"And politics is a blood sport, so they’re going to come up with whatever attacks they can to destroy the public perception of someone.\"\n\nWe have a saying around here: you can’t hate the media enough. Once again, they piled on like sheep when it fit the leftist narrative, then clammed up like Mafia bosses when it didn’t. It reminds me of a similar moment in March 2024 when Trump talked about the bloodbath in the auto industry. Dozens of outlets jumped in with what almost seemed like coordinated headlines to preposterously claim that he was calling for violence in the streets. \n\nHe was giving a speech on the economy, dingbats.\n\nMedia Fail Compilation: 'Bloodbath' Headlines in Lockstep With DNC Talking Points\n\nAs we reported, Musk posted to social media on New Year’s Day that he is fully behind supporting the GOP in the midterms.

His rather public rift with Trump last year was extremely disappointing, and his flirtation with starting a third party was, to say the least, not helpful. But, he appears to have given up on that vanity project, at least for now, realizing that there’s too much at stake if Democrats return to power. That said, I have reasons to question just how much his financial support will matter.\n\nRelated: Elon Musk's Dire Warning for the U.S. in 2026 — and What He Plans to Do About It\n\nMidterms are rarely kind to the party in power—and that’s a serious challenge for President Trump and the GOP. Democrats smell blood in the water, seeing their recent off-year election victories as proof of momentum, and they’re no doubt thinking they’re on a fast track to winning back the majority and using their powers to open new investigations under the banner of “oversight.” Everyone knows what that means. At the very least, they intend to cripple Trump’s agenda and set the stage for a third impeachment, no doubt more ridiculous than the previous two.\n\nDespite historic precedent, Democrats won’t have the easiest time winning back the majority. Recent polls show the party with historically devastating approval ratings, not just overall, but from their own supporters. That’s hardly a great foundation. On top of that, the DNC is in financial chaos. By the end of October, the committee had just $18.3 million in cash, and $15 million of that was borrowed. Those races they won last year are hyped as signs of strength heading into the midterms, but the reality is they were burning through money just to stay afloat in deep-blue states and districts. Meanwhile, the RNC sits comfortably with far more cash and zero debt — a financial edge that already gives them a leg up in this year’s midterms.\n\nIn 2024, Musk spent more than $290 million on Republican campaigns — about $100 million more than any other political contributor in that cycle. According to Newsmax, it’s not clear how much Musk has spent so far, but “big checks” have already been written.\n\nIt’s all helpful, but money doesn’t guarantee victory.\n\nHillary Clinton learned that in 2016. Kamala Harris learned it again in 2024. Both outspent Trump by huge margins—and both lost. Raw cash helps build campaigns, but elections are won with momentum, message, and mood. Right now, that mood is complicated. Despite their poor approval ratings, Democrats hold a narrow lead in the generic congressional ballot, 46.2% to 42.2%, according to RealClearPolitics.\n\nIn the end, if voters believe Trump has revived growth and restored confidence, the GOP will cruise to victory. If not, all the mega-donations in the world won’t save them.","url":"https://pjmedia.com/matt-margolis/2026/01/02/can-elon-musk-deliver-the-2026-midterms-for-the-gop-n4947817","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2025/42/cfff3b39-95b8-4a7f-9c7f-905280cfde1b.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-03 00:47:00","author":"Matt Margolis","authors":["Matt Margolis"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.254},{"id":390857364,"title":"Joe Rogan insists Kamala Harris would've done 'fine' on his 3-hour-show: 'Could've talked for hours'","text":"Joe Rogan defended former Vice President Kamala Harris Wednesday after his guest suggested Harris would have floundered on Rogan’s three-hour podcast had she accepted his invitation during the 2024 presidential campaign.

Hochul said in a statement. “Starting today, tax rates for the vast majority of lower and middle-class New Yorkers will be cut, families with children will see a sweeping increase in the child tax credit, and minimum wage workers across the state will see their wages go up.”\n\nAnd then she tried to take credit for the policy.\n\n“I’m kicking the new year off with a proposal of no state income tax on tips, continuing my efforts to make New York more affordable for hard working New Yorkers.”\n\nHer plan would exempt up to $25,000 in tip income from New York state income tax starting in 2026. Hochul tried to dress it up as some grand affordability initiative, but everyone knows what this really is: a desperate attempt to stop the bleeding after Trump's federal \"no tax on tips\" policy exposed just how out of touch she has become.\n\nWhich brings us back to the key question: why did she flip-flop?\n\nThere’s only one explanation. Hochul knows that Donald Trump's no tax on tips policy is popular — heck, even Kamala Harris tried to pitch her own version of it — and someone has to run for reelection this year. Sure, most polls show her comfortably ahead, but when Rep. Elise Stefanik was still in the race, polls showed her ahead of Hochul or virtually tied. In 2022, she won reelection by a relatively small (and uncomfortable) margin against Lee Zeldin, and opposition to a popular policy wasn’t going to do her any favors. Hochul is weaker than many people think; she clearly knows it.\n\nRecommended: Mamdani Goes Full Antisemite on Day One\n\nI’m guessing polling told her that if she didn’t end state taxes on tips to match the federal policy, it would cost her in November. I can tell you one thing: Hochul didn't wake up one morning and suddenly start caring about the financial plight of bartenders and servers. She got dragged kicking and screaming to this position after tipped workers across New York torched her for refusing to follow Trump's lead.\n\nHochul tried to bury the announcement by releasing it just hours before New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani's inauguration ceremony. She also threw in additional “affordability” measures, such as a tax cut for middle-class earners and an expansion of the state child tax credit. But nobody's fooled. This is a political Hail Mary from a governor who knows she's in trouble. Trump's policies are resonating with voters, and Hochul just admitted it.\n\nIt's not complicated. Trump eliminated federal income taxes on tips, and voters love it. But Democratic governors spent weeks hemming and hawing, trying to balance resisting Trump and appeasing the voters they need to stay in power.\n\n\"It seems like the Democratic playbook is that anything that has Donald Trump's name on it, they can't accept it,\" State Sen. Dean Murray (R-3rd District) observed.\n\nHochul’s sudden flip-flop on this issue is a telltale sign that she lacks confidence in her reelection prospects. Democratic governors, especially those harboring 2028 ambitions, know that resisting Trump is a litmus test for the party faithful. Hochul is no presidential contender, but she could plausibly land on a future Democratic ticket as a vice-presidential pick; however, she has to win reelection first to make the contenders list, and her position on no tax on tips might have been politically necessary to keep her job. All I know is that she wouldn’t flip-flop on this issue if it weren’t politically necessary.","url":"https://pjmedia.com/matt-margolis/2026/01/02/has-kathy-hochul-just-admitted-her-campaign-is-in-trouble-n4947832","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2025/163/57e9882b-c754-44b5-9569-4f346c886483.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-02 22:34:00","author":"Matt Margolis","authors":["Matt Margolis"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.253},{"id":390905658,"title":"What Mayor Zohran Mamdani Wore to His First Day of Work","text":"While partygoers and ball-drop attendees in Midtown Manhattan spent the first seconds of January 1 locking lips with strangers and barely holding in their pee, Zohran Mamdani became the first person ever to take oath as mayor of New York City by placing his hand on a family copy of the Quran. As of yesterday, Mamdani, 34, also now holds the distinction of being the city’s first mayor of South Asian descent and of Islamic faith, and the city’s youngest mayor in the last century. This confluence of firsts was represented in the mayor’s unique necktie, which was fastened using a sleek four-in-hand knot—arguably a more elegant alternative to the hulking Windsor, as favored among other factions of the US government.\nMade of handwoven, lightly textured eri silk, the custom tie was created by the New Delhi-based designer Kartik Kumra under his label, Kartik Research, and selected for the occasion by stylist and former Vogue editor Gabriella Karefa-Johnson. It was fitting that Karefa-Johnson should be the one to style New York’s newest political family—an announcement she made this week via her Substack, “Brain Matter,” a medium that feels perfectly congruent with the youthful momentum of the mayor’s appointment. The stylist, like Mamdani and his wife, the artist Rama Duwaji, has been outspoken regarding her progressive political views (many of which align with that of the new mayor’s) and has accrued some notable firsts of her own. Five years ago last month, she became the first Black woman to style an American Vogue cover, dressing the model Paloma Elsesser for the magazine’s January 2021 issue; she also styled then-Vice President Kamala Harris for her Vogue cover several months later. Plus, the brand story of Kartik Research feels especially fitting for a young mayor with Indian roots who grew up in NYC; last year, Kumra opened his first US store on Orchard Street in downtown Manhattan.\nFor Mamdani’s private inaugural ceremony, held underground in the Old City Hall station downtown in the early hours of Thursday morning, the stylist employed her strategic savoir faire in a manner that only enhanced our perception of the city’s young mayor. As she wrote in her newsletter, owns two pairs of boots and sources his suits from a popular purveyor: Suitsupply. (Lest we forget, Barack Obama wore Brooks Brothers to his presidential inauguration in 2009.) He’s of Indian heritage and a people-first politician, and his tie effectively references those simple truths through its origins and gold floral embroidering—a wink, per Karefa-Johnson, at one of the city’s beloved mayors and a fellow progressive legislator, Fiorello La Guardia, who expanded public housing, fought for laborers, and was known, affectionately, as the “little flower.”\nAnd on his wrist, as per usual, the mayor wore his preferred Casio watch.\nDuring the private ceremony, holding Mamdani’s grandfather’s Quran was the mayor’s wife, Duwaji, 28, who was also dressed by Karefa-Johnson. The city’s new first lady wore a secondhand Balenciaga coat, pointy leather boots from the London-based label Miista (which, as Karefa-Johnson clarified in her post, were a loan from the brand), and tailored shorts from The Frankie Shop. Later in the day, for Mamdani’s public inauguration, she wore a brown fur-tiered coat by Palestinian-Lebanese designer Cynthia Merhej of Renaissance, Renaissance, a look that evoked the elegance of Jackie O., thoughtfully updated for a new, politically passionate generation.\n“On her first official day as First Lady of New York, Rama is wearing a small, independent woman designer from the Middle East. That representation resonates,” Karefa-Johnson wrote. “It reverberates. Because fashion communicates. It sends a message. This, we know.” In the audience as Mamdani (who was wearing his usual suit and black leather boots) delivered his inaugural speech were fellow New Yorkers, including Brooklyn-born Senator Bernie Sanders and Bronx-and-Queens-based Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, all bundled up in puffer coats, beanies, and blankets.\nNew Yorkers watched—tearfully, excitedly—as Mamdani thanked his Mama and Baba, his family “from Kampala to Dili,” and his wife, Rama, and then turned to the shivering hoard that voted him in and thanked them as well.","summary":"For his first moments as the new mayor of New York City, Mamdani wore a jazzy tie made by a buzzy Indian designer.","url":"https://www.gq.com/story/zohran-mamdani-inauguration-tie-kartik-research","image":"https://media.gq.com/photos/6957d2fa5ef3aa0ee8599f43/16:9/w_4000,h_2250,c_limit/2253647838","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-02 21:43:33","author":"Savannah Sobrevilla","authors":["Savannah Sobrevilla"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.53},{"id":390857362,"title":"Conservatives torch media after Mamdani avoids Musk-level backlash over 'identical' on-stage gesture","text":"Conservatives are calling out what they say is a media double standard after newly sworn-in New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani was seen extending his arm during his inauguration Thursday — a gesture they argue mirrors a motion Elon Musk made a year ago that ignited widespread headlines accusing the tech billionaire of delivering a \"Nazi salute.\" \"Not a single one of these legacy media outlets reported on Mamdani’s identical hand gesture which they called @elonmusk a nazi for Do you see what’s happening?\" popular conservative X account Libs of TikTok posted Friday, accompanied by screenshots of media outlets stretching from the Guardian to Vox reported on accusations that Musk delivered a \"Nazi-style salute\" to Trump supporters Jan. 20. Liberals and critics frequently attacked Trump while he was on the campaign trail by calling him a Hitler-esque fascist, including former Vice President Kamala Harris, who compared Trump to the German dictator during a town hall in the final stretch of the 2024 election cycle. Musk attended Trump's inaugural parade in 2025, where he spoke to supporters and was accused of giving a Hitler-style salute to the crowds — a narrative that was promoted by Democrats such as Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. Musk and Republicans lambasted and mocked the accusations when they cropped up, including the tech billionaire floating a potential defamation lawsuit against Walz for promoting the claim. CRITICS SAY MAMDANI’S VOW TO SWAP ‘RUGGED INDIVIDUALISM’ WITH ‘WARMTH OF COLLECTIVISM’ HAS SINISTER UNDERTONE Fast-forward nearly a year, conservatives are questioning why Mamdani has not faced similar accusations after he was seen extending his arm in a gesture similar to Musk's. \"Zohran Mamdani did the same exact gesture today at his swearing in that the left called a ‘Nazi salute’ when @elonmusk did it,\" former liberal and WalkAway — a movement encouraging people to leave the Democratic Party — founder Brandon Straka posted to X. \"They lie,\" Musk posted to X Friday in response to Libs of TikTok's message showing a swath of headlines from earlier in 2025 reporting that the tech billionaire allegedly gave a Nazi salute. \"HOLY CRAP! Zohran Mamdani just did the EXACT SAME gesture as Elon Musk When Elon does it, it's a ‘Nazi salute.’ When communist Zohran does it, the media is silent. The media is the enemy of the people,\" conservative commentator Eric Daugherty posted. \"Did Mamdani do a nazi salute?!?! Literally shaking rn I’m sure CNN and MSNBC will be all over this,\" Libs of TikTok posted in another message mocking Democrats over their January comments targeting Musk.

They are not ideologically consistent and their hypocrisy knows no bounds. They do NOT care about any of that. They just care about political power and feeling virtuous,\" another posted. \"Zohran Mamdani can make this gesture and everyone loves him for it, but when Elon Musk does it? The leftist media wasted no time calling him a Nazi,\" the Media Research Center posted to X. Mamdani, a 34-year-old democratic socialist, took office Thursday, with ceremonies that included a public swearing-in outside City Hall and an earlier private oath at the decommissioned City Hall subway station. Mamdani was seen lifting his hand from his heart to the crowds of supporters at the end of his speech during the public ceremony. \"I was elected as a Democratic socialist, and I will govern as a Democratic socialist,\" he said. FLASHBACK: INSIDE THE POLITICAL MOVEMENT THAT PUT A SOCIALIST IN CHARGE OF NEW YORK CITY \"Beginning today, we will govern expansively and audaciously,\" Mamdani said, acknowledging that his agenda may not always succeed but insisting it would be bold. \"To those who insist that the era of big government is over, hear me when I say this: No longer will City Hall hesitate to use its power to improve New Yorkers’ lives.\" Fox News Digital reached out to Mamdani's office regarding conservatives' comments over the salute considering previous coverage of Musk, but did not immediately receive a reply. Musk served as the Trump administration's public leader of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which Trump established at the start of his second administration to weed out fraud, government overspending and mismanagement from the federal government. Musk was a common fixture of the administration — serving as a special government employee — until May, when he criticized Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" for raising the debt ceiling, fracturing the relationship. Musk and Trump have since been spotted at public events together, including chatting with one another. MEDIA OUTLETS ACCUSE ELON MUSK OF GIVING 'FASCIST SALUTE' AT TRUMP INAUGURATION RALLY Musk slammed comparisons to Nazis toward the end of his DOGE tenure, pointing to it as another example of the long-running attacks against Trump and his supporters. \"Well, I mean, look, it’s a relentless propaganda campaign, which obviously President Trump has experienced for a very long time, 20 years, maybe longer,\" Musk said on Fox News' \"My View with Lara Trump\" in May. \"And politics is a blood sport, so they’re going to come up with whatever attacks they can to destroy the public perception of someone.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Now, obviously, I’ve not harmed anyone in my life, so it’s an outrageous thing to claim that I’m a Nazi,\" he added.","summary":"Media outlets that accused Elon Musk of Nazi-style salute in 2024 remain silent on similar gesture by NYC Mayor Zohran Mamdani at his Thursday inauguration, conservatives claim.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/conservatives-torch-media-after-mamdani-avoids-musk-level-backlash-over-identical-on-stage-gesture","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2026/01/mamdani-elon-musk.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-02 21:32:22","author":"Emma Colton","authors":["Emma Colton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.611},{"id":390860710,"title":"Year-end upset spells big trouble for GOP: analysis","text":"MS NOW analyst Steve Benen says the year 2025 ended on a note that should have Republicans quaking in their boots.\n\n“While 2025 was ostensibly an off year for elections, the year proved to be filled with fascinating and important contests, culminating in one final race earlier this week,” Benen said. “The last special election of the year was in Iowa, where voters in a Des Moines-area district were tasked with choosing a new state senator.”\n\nIt was an urban Democratic district that Kamala Harris won by 17 points in 2024.

Trump had successfully realigned the American electorate to put the GOP in a position to control the nation and its future.”\n\nThe same argument claimed the Democratic Party was not just defeated, but shattered, with a “demoralized and disheartened base, filled with voters who were prepared to withdraw from civic life for a long while,” said Benen.\n\nThe Democratic “brand,” according to critics like California Gov.

The growing number of intraparty battles has sparked concerns that nominating left-wing candidates could complicate Democrats’ efforts to flip GOP-held seats in 2026.\n\nSome Democratic strategists have cited Tennessee Democratic candidate Aftyn Behn’s loss in December as a prime example of the risk of nominating a staunch progressive to run in a Republican-leaning district.\n\nThough Behn kept the special election race within single digits — in a district President Donald Trump had carried by 22 percentage points in 2024 — some Democrats have argued the contest could have been within reach for the party if it had backed a more centrist candidate who more closely matched the views of the district.\n\n“Each time we nominate a far-left candidate in a swing district who declares themselves to be radical and alienates the voters in the middle who deliver majorities, we set back that cause,” Lanae Erickson, senior Vice President for Social Policy, Education & Politics, at liberal think tank Third Way said in a statement following Behn’s loss.\n\n“Might’ve been winnable with the right candidate, but Aftyn ‘I’m a very radical person’ Behn was not it,” Democratic strategist Simon Balezon wrote on X.\n\nNational Republicans are also eager to tie Democrats running in purple districts to New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani’s brand of democratic socialism. The increasing number of primary contests could also force Democrats to spend considerable resources in the primary while GOP incumbents rake in cash for the general election.\n\n“Democrats are trapped in a civil war of their own making, dragged left by Zohran Mamdani radicals while their swing seats bleed money,” NRCC spokesman Mike Marinella said in a statement. “This is what a party in panic looks like.”\n\nHouse Democrats’ campaign arm countered that the number of primaries are a product of the party’s strong performance in the 2025 off-year elections and lead in the generic ballot. Republicans, however, continue to hold a higher favorability rating than Democrats and GOP incumbents have largely maintained an edge in fundraising over their Democratic challengers.\n\n“Every poll and election result this year point to one reality: voters are tired of Republicans’ broken promises and are poised to deliver major wins for Democrats in the midterms,” Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) spokesperson Viet Shelton told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “It’s why we are fielding such a large and incredibly strong class of candidates across the country while Republicans are not.”\n\nContentious Democratic primaries with notable ideological and factional divides are playing out in the following four battleground districts. Given House Republicans’ razor-thin majority, these swing seats are likely to help decide House control during the midterms.\n\nCalifornia’s 22nd District \n\nDemocrats are locked in a fierce contest to unseat moderate Republican California Rep. David Valadao, who has successfully fended off Democratic challenges over consecutive cycles. Valadao’s reelection bid became more difficult after Democratic California Governor Gavin Newsom’s gerrymander redrew the majority-Hispanic district from one Trump won by six percentage points in 2024 to one the president would have carried by only two points.\n\nCollege professor and school board trustee Randy Villegas, 31, is running for the majority-Hispanic district as a staunch progressive. He has secured independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ endorsement and is affiliated with the left-wing Working Families Party.\n\nVillegas has also tapped political strategist Morris Katz, who helped steer New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani’s left-wing populist campaign, to cut ads for his congressional run.\n\nCalifornia state legislator Jasmeet Bains, 40, is running on a more moderate platform. She has rolled out a slate of endorsements from establishment California Democrats and EMILYs List, a pro-abortion organization supporting female candidates.\n\nVillegas has flexed his progressive credentials by swearing off corporate PAC money and including Medicare for All in his campaign platform — a universal taxpayer-funded health proposal that has divided Democrats.\n\nValadao entered October with nearly $1.8 million on hand, dwarfing Bains and Villegas who both reported less than $300,000 in the bank. With the retirement of Republican Washington Rep. Dan Newhouse, Valadao is the only remaining House Republican who voted to impeach Trump in 2021 seeking reelection in 2026.\n\nColorado’s 8th District \n\nRepublican Colorado Rep. Gabe Evans, a freshman lawmaker, is facing several Democratic challengers in a purple district that narrowly voted for Trump.\n\nColorado progressive Manny Rutinel, 30, is vying for the Democratic nomination against fellow state legislator Shannon Bird, 56, who is running on a more moderate platform.\n\nRutinel has pledged to not accept corporate PAC donations and has won the support of the left-leaning Congressional Hispanic Caucus’ campaign arm.\n\nBird is backed by EMILYs List and WelcomePAC, a center-left organization working to elect Democratic candidates in Trump-won districts. She announced her resignation from the state legislature in early December to focus on her congressional run.\n\nEvans leads the field in fundraising and ended 2025’s third fundraising quarter with nearly $2 million in the bank. Rutinel has maintained an edge over Bird in fundraising. He ended September with $1 million on hand.\n\nPennsylvania’s 7th District \n\nFive Democratic candidates are vying in a crowded primary to defeat Republican Pennsylvania Rep. Ryan Mackenzie in 2026. The freshman lawmaker representing a bellwether district in the Lehigh Valley is one of Democrats’ top targets in the midterms. The swing district backed Trump in 2024 after voting for former President Joe Biden in 2020.\n\nMackenzie, 43, defeated then-incumbent Democratic Pennsylvania Rep. Susan Wild by 1 point in 2024. Wild has endorsed Carol Obando-Derstine, a one-time staffer to former Democratic Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey, to challenge Mackenzie.\n\nPennsylvania Professional Firefighters Association president Bob Brooks leads the field in endorsements drawing support from progressives, such as Sanders and Democratic California Rep. Ro Khanna. Establishment Democrats, including Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, are also backing the union leader’s campaign.\n\nNorthampton County executive Lamont McClure and former federal prosecutor and Marine reservist Ryan Crosswell are also vying for the Democratic nomination.\n\nMackenzie maintains a significant fundraising edge over the pack of Democratic candidates.\n\nThe incumbent reported more than $1.4 million in the bank at the end of September. Crosswell closed the year’s 3rd fundraising quarter with more than $430,000 on hand, followed by McClure and Brooks, who both reported less than $300,000.\n\nArizona’s 1st District \n\nDemocrats are also divided over the best candidate to succeed retiring Republican Arizona Rep. David Schweikert.\n\nThe battleground seat vacated by Schweikert — who is running for governor — spans parts of wealthy North Phoenix, Scottsdale and Paradise Valley that Trump carried by three points in 2024.\n\nFormer Democratic state legislator Amish Shah, who narrowly lost to Schweikert as the district’s 2024 Democratic nominee, is mounting a comeback bid for the swing seat. The ex-lawmaker has the support of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus’ campaign arm, which is affiliated with House Democrats.\n\nFormer TV anchor Marlene Galán-Woods is backed by the Congressional Hispanic Caucus’ campaign arm and EMILYs List.\n\nGalán-Woods came up short against Amish in the 2024 Democratic primary, placing third, and has argued the party should nominate a new face in 2026. She is the widow of late Republican Arizona Attorney General Grant Woods and was a registered Republican until 2018.\n\nTrump endorsed Arizona Republican Party chairwoman Gina Swoboda to succeed Schweikert in October, though the president’s support has failed to stop other candidates from entering the race. Turning Point Action chief operating officer Tyler Bowyer excoriated Swoboda’s leadership in a post on X in October.\n\nFormer sports reporter, analyst and National Football League (NFL) kicker Jay Feely announced on Dec. 19 that he would run against Swoboda in the district’s Republican primary after previously running in the neighboring safely Republican 5th district. Feely switched seats a month and a half after Trump endorsed another GOP candidate for the 5th district but added that he likes Feely “very much” and suggested the former NFL player should run for another district or office.\n\nFeely played in the NFL for 14 seasons including four with the Arizona Cardinals.\n\nIn another hotly-contested GOP-held seat, moderate and progressive factions of the Democratic Party have largely united around three-time Democratic candidate Rebecca Cooke, who is expected to face Republican Wisconsin Rep. Derrick Van Orden in the general election.\n\nCooke narrowly lost to Van Orden by roughly 12,000 votes in 2024. She notably outperformed former Vice President Kamala Harris by roughly three points, according to analysis by The Downballot.","summary":"Far-left challenging establishment for control of party in multiple locations","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2026/01/what-could-stop-democrats-flipping-control-congress/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/dnc-2024-blue-illuminated-jpg.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-02 18:54:02","author":"Daily Caller News Foundation","authors":["Daily Caller News Foundation"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.315},{"id":390885924,"title":"Trump’s aspirin dosing ‘makes no sense’ says Dick Cheney’s heart specialist","text":"A widely-respect heart specialist, who treated the late vice president Dick Cheney, has said President Donald Trump’s decision to take more than the recommended amount of aspirin “makes no sense.”\n\nDr. Jonathan Reiner spoke on CNN after the president gave an interview to The Wall Street Journal, where he said that he takes 325 milligrams of aspirin a day - much higher than the more common, daily low dose of 81 milligrams - and had done so for years.\n\n“I’m a little superstitious,” Trump told The Journal. “They say aspirin is good for thinning out the blood, and I don’t want thick blood pouring through my heart.

Nothing, zero, nothing,\" his White House chief of staff, Susie Wiles, told Vanity Fair, as reported in twoarticles last month that signaled her own unease with Trump's ongoing vengeance against his political enemies; his clemency for even the most violent rioters of Jan. 6, 2021; the pain of his erratic tariffs, too-cruel migrant roundups and tragic shutdown of USAID's humanitarian aid; his stonewalling of the Jeffrey Epstein files that candidate Trump promised to release; and the foibles of his slavish Cabinet.\n\nIf Trump strutted as the center of the universe in 2025 - unchecked by advisors like Wiles or by a cowed Republican-controlled Congress, the Supreme Court and corporate chieftains - buckle up for 2026. It marks the 250th birthday of America's independence, and our self-appointed master of ceremonies is focused on the festivities that he'll star in not only on July 4th but all year long. One of his first acts as president was to create a White House task force with himself as chair, of course, to plan semiquincentennial events, ignoring an eight-year-old commission created by Congress for that purpose. Coming soon: A (possibly illegal) commemorative $1 coin with Trump's image from the U.S. Mint.\n\nNever mind that 2026 starts with a big spike in health insurance costs for tens of millions of Americans, including many Trump voters. The president who campaigned on bringing down the costs of living has stood in the way of a legislative remedy to the Dec. 31 expiration of healthcare premium subsidies, repeatedly mouthing his years-old promise that he'll propose a cheaper alternative within weeks.\n\nBut here's how 2026 will end: with midterm elections in November that loom as a referendum on whether the Trump Republican Party should keep control of Congress. The early betting is that no, it won't. Especially after another year of Trump grandstanding, and his party's genuflecting.\n\nIn good times, Trump's garish self-regard might be tolerable to voters, even comical. But these aren't good times, hardly the \"golden age\" Trump announced in his inaugural address last January - except for him and the wealthy hangers-on at his seemingly endless round of parties in the White House and at Mar-a-Lago. The Gatsby-themed Halloween party at Trump's Florida resort was especially rich, pun intended, coming as it did hours before federal food aid for 42 million Americans expired amid a government shutdown he'd done nothing to avert.\n\nDays later, voters gave a shellacking to Republicans in various states' 2025 off-year elections, which is a good omen for the same result nationwide in 2026. There are other signs. On Tuesday, a new Gallup poll showed three out of four Americans were dissatisfied with \"the way things are going in the United States.\" Trump's approval rating was just 36% in Gallup's poll in early December, his lowest reading of the past year, and nearly equal to his all-time low after the Jan. 6 insurrection. Averages of various polls show Trump with negative ratings on his handling of immigration, the economy, trade and tariffs, and inflation - all issues that helped get him reelected.\n\nBut go ahead, Mr. President. Keep talking about how great you are. You're a legend in your own time and mind.\n\nTrump's tone-deafness has become the great mystery of U.S. politics, for both parties, especially considering that he slammed President Biden for bragging about the economy's post-pandemic recovery when Americans weren't feeling it.\n\nAs Americans struggle to buy a home or to afford its upkeep, Trump has gilded the People's House (see the New York Times' recent 3-D recreation of the Oval Office for full, nauseating effect) and transformed the bathroom adjoining the Lincoln Bedroom in marble and gold. Having demolished the East Wing to make way for a gargantuan ballroom where Marie Antoinette would be at home, financed by favor-seeking billionaires and corporations, Trump told reporters on Tuesday that it would have to be bigger than he'd first planned because \"we're gonna do the inauguration\" there.\n\nWhat? The man who's supposed to be leaving office on Jan. 20, 2029, is picking the new location for the next presidential inauguration? Hmmm.\n\nEven before he's been in office a year, Trump has put his brand on two Washington buildings, including the nation's 60-year-old cultural center named by law as a memorial to an assassinated president. The Kennedy Center (no, I will not call it by Trump's name) will have marble armrests; Trump took to social media on the day after Christmas to show off samples. Meanwhile, he's refurbishing a royal jet from Qatar, a \"palace in the sky.\"\n\nTrading on his power in unprecedented ways, Trump was a \"crypto billionaire\" by May, the Wall Street Journal reported, and in August the New Yorker estimated that he'd profited in office by at least $3.4 billion through crypto and licensing deals.\n\nNo, Trump is not for you. He's for he/him.\n\nBluesky: @jackiecalmes\n\nThreads: @jkcalmes\n\nX: @jackiekcalmes\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.\n\nTribune Regional CA","url":"https://www.sacbee.com/opinion/us-viewpoints/article314123872.html","image":"https://www.sacbee.com/wps/build/images/sacbee/facebook.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-02 18:04:09","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.191},{"id":390825204,"title":"From Donald Trump to Benjamin Netanyahu, let 2026 be a year of reckoning | Jonathan Freedland","text":"It’s not quite a new year resolution, and it’s certainly not a prediction. Think of it instead as a hope or even a plea for the next 12 months. May the coming year see those leaders who have done so much damage to their own countries, and far beyond, at last be called to account. Let 2026 be a year of reckoning.\n\nStart with the man whose reach is longest, by dint of the mighty power he wields. Such is the nature of the US electoral system that Donald Trump, who returned to power less than a year ago, will face the judgment of voters in 10 months’ time. His name will not be on the ballot but, make no mistake, the midterm elections of 3 November will deliver a verdict on the second Trump presidency.\n\nA slew of congressional defeats for his party would be satisfying in itself, wounding that gargantuan ego of his, but it would also have practical significance. Few predict the Republicans losing control of the Senate, where Democrats would have to flip at least four seats to take charge – near-impossible given the geography of the 35 seats up for grabs in November. But, in normal circumstances, it should be the safest of political bets that the House of Representatives will no longer be in Republican hands a year from now.\n\nSuch a reverse would dispel the aura of indomitability that has enveloped Trump since he beat Kamala Harris, allowing him to bully and intimidate multiple US institutions, including much of its media, into ceding to him far more power than is rightfully his. It would render him a lame duck, incapable of passing new laws through a hostile chamber.\n\nAbove all, it would see Trump confronted at last with a body both eager and able to hold him to account: a Democratic House would have the appetite and the muscle for serious scrutiny. Armed with subpoena power, it could investigate everything from the cost of Trump’s tariffs for US taxpayers to the astonishingly brazen pattern of corruption and pocket-lining that has characterised this administration. And up its sleeve would be the constant threat of a third impeachment trial.\n\nSo November could indeed bring a reckoning for Trump, which is why he will stop at nothing to avert that outcome. Hence the words of caution above: “in normal circumstances”. Trump will make the circumstances abnormal, if that’s what it takes to keep the House. That effort is already under way, whether in the form of gerrymandered maps in Texas or moves to make voting harder in Democratic areas across the country.\n\nThere are heartening signs of institutions beginning to push back – witness last week’s supreme court decision reining in Trump’s deployment of US troops on the streets of Democrat-led cities – but this will be one of the battles of 2026, as the president stretches every sinew to avoid the accountability an autumn defeat would bring.\n\nIn that, he has a soul brother in the man he hosted in Mar-a-Lago this week, in what was their sixth and final meeting of 2025: Benjamin Netanyahu. Except the electoral peril confronting Netanyahu, whose first term as Israel’s prime minister began in 1996, is more direct: at some point between now and October, Israelis will go to the polls in a contest that could remove him from power altogether.\n\nCentral will be the holding of Netanyahu to account. Many around the world will want that to be for the killing of tens of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza, for the relentless aerial bombardment that has left the strip in ruins and for the withholding of humanitarian aid. But inside Israel, the accountability that is sought most keenly is for the deadly failures of 7 October 2023, for the complacency and strategic errors that left a string of southern communities, and hundreds of people at a music festival, exposed to murderous Hamas attack.\n\nIsraeli officials at every level, civilian and military, have paid for that catastrophe with their jobs – bar one. Only Netanyahu has never admitted the slightest responsibility, let alone apologised, for the fact that the deadliest day in the country’s history came on his watch. He has refused to establish a commission of inquiry like those that swiftly followed previous calamities, preferring instead a sham investigation staffed by loyalists – equivalent, as the father of one slain hostage put it, to asking the iceberg to find out who sank the Titanic. So the only chance Israelis will have to hold to account the man who has ruled them for 18 of the past 30 years will be at the ballot box.\n\nThe stakes could hardly be higher. Plenty of Israeli campaigners fear this election might be the last chance to save key democratic institutions that have been under sustained assault from Netanyahu for so long. Like Trump in the US or Viktor Orbán in Hungary, who also faces voters this year, Netanyahu has been in an escalating war with the judiciary and independent media, squeezing them ever harder, hoping they will choke. And, like his pal in Washington, Netanyahu will stop at nothing to deny his opponents an electoral victory: on trial on corruption charges, he needs to stay in power in order to stay out of jail. Accountability of both the political and legal varieties terrifies him.\n\nAnd he is not the only leader in the region fearful of the anger of his own people. Iranians have tried and tried again to vent their fury at the regime that has ruled their country for 47 years, only to be suppressed, often brutally. Protests have erupted once again in recent days, the authorities resorting to lethal force even more rapidly than in the past – though there are encouraging signs that some in the security forces are reluctant to engage in the usual crackdown. For years, many inside Iran have despaired at a regime bent on becoming a regional power by sponsoring terror and mayhem in the Middle East and beyond, with ordinary Iranians paying the price in sanctions and economic pain. The reckoning for that has been postponed, more than once. But the demand for change is loud and, says the scholar of Iran Ali Ansari, “Sooner or later something will have to give.”\n\nIn the streets or at the ballot box, accountability could be coming in 2026. In Britain, the Labour government has good reason to fear it, bracing for big losses in every direction, whether to Plaid Cymru in Wales, the Scottish National party in Scotland, the Greens especially in London or Reform UK almost everywhere. In a just world, Nigel Farage would fear the voters, anxious that they would hold him to account not only for his squalid past but as the man who served as chief evangelist for the most disastrous national decision since Munich, namely the Brexit referendum, which marks its 10th anniversary in June.\n\nI concede it’s unlikely that 2026 will see Farage pay for his starring role in that ongoing act of collective self-harm. But eventually Trump, Netanyahu, Orbán and the others must face a reckoning for the pain they have caused and the damage they have done. Let this be the year.\n\n Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist\n\n Guardian newsroom: Year One of Trumpism: Is Britain Emulating the US?\n On Wednesday 21 January 2026, join Jonathan Freedland, Tania Branigan and Nick Lowles as they reflect on the first year of Donald Trump’s second presidency – and to ask if Britain could be set on the same path.\n Book tickets here or at guardian.live","summary":"These malign figures will do anything to avoid paying for the harm they have done, but accountability must eventually come to both\n\nIt’s not quite a new year resolution, and it’s certainly not a prediction.

The president's remarks were initially sparked by Clooney and wife Amal's naturalization as French citizens.\n\n Days after Trump celebrated Clooney's family gaining French citizenship, Entertainment Weekly obtained a statement from the 64-year-old in response to the president's criticism, which included the politician calling it \"Good News\" that George and Amal are now citizens of France.\n\n \"I totally agree with the current president. We have to make America great again,\" Clooney's statement reads, referencing Trump's signature slogan, before looking ahead to midterm elections. \"We’ll start in November.\"\n\n After news of the Clooney family's French citizenship broke in December, Trump initially called George and Amal \"two of the worst political prognosticators of all time\" in a Dec. 31 Truth Social post, before celebrating the notion that they could, in theory, move to France as citizens.\n\n Trump slammed France for being in the middle of what he called \"a major crime problem because of their absolutely horrendous handling of immigration,\" before comparing it to immigration under President Joe Biden's administration.\n\n \"Remember when Clooney, after the now infamous debate, dumped Joe during a fundraiser, only to go onto the side of another stellar candidate, Jamala(K!),\" Trump wrote, before predicting that Democrats would face \"future defeat\" if they aligned behind California Gov. Gavin Newsom in the 2028 presidential election.\n\n \"Clooney got more publicity for politics than he did for his very few, and totally mediocre, movies,\" he said of the Jay Kelly actor's political dealings, which included public criticism for Biden following the president's disastrous performance against Trump at a June 2024 debate. \"He wasn’t a movie star at all, he was just an average guy who complained, constantly, about common sense in politics. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\"\n\n Though many similarly called for Biden to bow out of the 2024 presidential race against Trump (which he eventually did, before endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris to succeed him on the ticket), left-leaning figures slammed Clooney for doing so in such public fashion.\n\n \"George Clooney wrote an op-ed piece in the New York Times claiming that after he saw Biden's condition at the recent fundraiser, he doesn't think he's up for the gig.

But it’s not even the first time X’s AI has been under fire for undressing photos","text":"For a moment, when I read the headlines, I thought I was seeing an old post, but no – X’s Grok AI is being called out for undressing any photo…again. The former Twitter’s AI image editor has come under fire for answering requests like “remove her clothes” for a second time.\n\nLast year, X added the ability for users to use an @ tag to ask the AI Grok a question and get a publicly posted response from the chatbot. In May of 2025, an investigative report showed that X’s Grok AI was not only responding to requests like “remove her clothes” but posting the resulting edited images publicly. After the report came out, the autonomous chatbot started responding to similar requests with “I can’t help with that.”\n\nBut, at the end of 2025, X added a tool that allows users to edit any photo using the AI by clicking on the “...” menu and accessing the new “edit image” option. Following the announcement, some artists announced that they would no longer be sharing their artwork on the platform for anyone to be able to just edit with AI.\n\nThe updated feature has sparked a new trend on X of generating or regenerating photos of celebrities in bikinis on the social platform – although the feature isn’t limited to only celebrity faces. Elon Musk himself even joined in by posting a Grok-generated image of himself in a bikini.\n\nA number of users have shared posts illustrating that the chatbot has no qualms with re-imagining a person in the photo in a bikini.\n\nWhile some argue the trend is designed, much like Grok itself, for humor, the Grok bikini trend is also raising concerns over not just AI, but sparking discussions on consent and privacy. A celebrity like Musk posting a bikini image of himself is one thing; X users asking to see someone in a bikini without their permission is something entirely different.\n\nThe AI’s willingness to put anyone in a bikini is not new. Along with the backlash from last May, the AI came under fire shortly after its image-generating capabilities were introduced for generating images of political candidates, including then presidential hopeful Kamala Harris in a bikini.\n\nAlong with continuing to drive artists away from the platform, the latest Grok backlash highlights the dangers of an autonomous, readily accessible AI. Since the AI’s launch, Grok has prided itself on being an AI with more lax restrictions, which were originally designed to give the AI a sense of humor.\n\nYou may also like\n\nBrowse alternative social media platforms for photographers.","summary":"A new X feature and an AI bikini trend is resurfacing a debate on consent in the age of AI","url":"https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/tech/artificial-intelligence/the-internet-is-calling-out-grok-for-nudifying-photos-but-its-not-even-the-first-time-xs-ai-has-been-under-fire-for-undressing-photos","image":"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Feu6teFXPkiRwMTSpSmX6i-2560-80.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-02 16:58:42","author":"Hillary K.

Of course, fewer people tuned in during an off-election year. \n\nCompared to the 2024 presidential election year, Fox News increased its total viewership by double-digits in 2025. Average total primetime viewers at Fox were up 14 percent to 2.72 million, which is nearly five(!) times as many primetime viewers as CNNLOL. Throughout the full day, Fox News increased its 2025 total viewers by 18 percent over 2024, with a 1.7 million average.\n\nFox News also crushed the garbage network formerly known as MSNBC. Compared to 2024, MS NOW lost 25 percent of its total primetime viewers in 2025, averaging only 925,000. Throughout the full day, MS NOW lost a whopping 30 percent of its viewers with an average of just 552,000.\n\nBelow are charts that include the percentages compared to 2024:\n\nAverage 2025 Primetime Viewers / Demo Viewers\n\nFox News: 2.72M (+14) / 287,000 (+18)\nMS NOW: 923,000 (-25) / 81,000 (-39)\nCNNLOL: 580,000 (-15) / 105,000 (-29)\n\nAverage 2025 Total Day Viewers / Demo Viewers\n\nFox News: 1.7M (+18) / 185,000 (-1)\nMS NOW: 552,000 (-30) / 49,000 (-42)\nCNNLOL: 436,000 (-9) / 71,000 (-22)\n\nThe averages above include the weekends.

Rather, it was an existential lie both outlets told their viewers for most of the last decade — that Donald Trump and the MAGA movement were doomed and all you had to do was hang on through the commercial break to watch it happen.\n\nDemocrats don’t care if the media lie. They expect and want the media to lie. Lies used to damage the Democrat Party’s enemies are wanted and desired. Bring on the Russia Hoax! Bring on the false rape claims! Whatever it takes! But when CNN and MS NOW assured Democrat viewers that Trump and Trumpism were dead and that Kamala Harris would brat her way to the Oval Office, that’s when the base fled. Lying to the American people is one thing. Lying to the leftist base is another. Democrats feel cheated, used, and demoralized by CNN and MS NOW, as well they should.\n\nAdditionally, anyone who paid attention to the 2025 news cycle knows that CNN and MS NOW have lost more than viewers. Neither had any real impact on the 2025 news cycle.

Somehow, the call to have a fully fleshed-out news report has been declared upsetting by those who claim to be intrepid journalists.\n\nAdding to the despair was an announcement that came from the new CBS Evening News host, Tony Dokoupil, who laid out the new policy for that program. As he takes over from the failed experiment of the duo of Maurice DuBois and John Dickerson co-hosting, Dokoupil stated their new format will seek a return to more standardized news reporting.\n\nREAD MORE: CBS Evening News Announces Big Change in Approach That's Already Causing the Left to Melt Down\n\nThis has only poured more kerosene on the media conflagration that has been burning since the arrival of Bari Weiss as the new head of CBS News. The news division has been roiled for much of the year over the lawsuit brought by President Trump, and then the settlement being reached as a result of the Skydance merger with parent company Paramount. The Weiss decision to pull a segment from 60 Minutes over editing decisions has seen the mewling in the media getting ramped up to pure hysteria.\n\nThe critics have been loudly declaring this is all a move to appease Trump and is the dumbing down of the news to appease MAGA. The other side of this complaint is a precious approach: Weiss is sullying the good character of the esteemed credibility of CBS News. This is a chortle-inducing comment that leads to asking a direct question:\n\nHave you even watched CBS News or 60 Minutes lately?!\n\nAs a rhetorical response, allow me to say I have, and this is why this current wave of outrage is so hilarious. A rundown of examples of the highly regarded journalism on display is all that is needed to lay bare this fraudulent wailing.\n\nThe Kamala Harris manipulated editing on the Kamala Harris pre-election interview is just the start, but the network reaction was what made things glaringly worse. First, the excuse was that the interview was chopped up due to time constraints. But this was belied by reality. The controversy emerged because CBS first ran promotional snippets of the interview on the Sunday morning talk shows, but when the full segment ran on 60 Minutes, people noticed her response differed from what was shown in the morning, despite having a full broadcast segment at night with vastly more time. \n\nThe other issue was the manner in which the network altered its usual practice of providing transcripts and/or the full video of the interview after broadcast. Yes, a two-hour conversation needs to be cut down for a segment in primetime, but this is why the full disclosure was always made later. CBS News did not provide the transcript and video until February of this year, after being compelled by the FCC investigating the controversy. That was just the start of the issues at that news show.\n\nAdditionally, we saw Leslie Stahl interviewing a released Israeli hostage, and when the issue of his being starved while in captivity, Ms. Stahl defended the Hamas hostiles by suggesting they might not have had enough food for themselves. In a report on the cuts and closing of USAID, they presented it as a constitutional crisis because the agency was created by an act of Congress. The FACT is, it was created by President Kennedy and operated under the authority of the president and the Executive Branch.\n\nAlso on 60 Minutes, they ran a segment that was actually supportive of speech limitation practices in Germany. It sat with members of a group that wants to target what they deem to be offensive speech and then punish it.\n\nIn the United States, most of what anyone says, sends, or streams online — even if it's hate-filled or toxic — is protected by the First Amendment as free speech. But Germany is trying to bring some civility to the world wide web by policing it in a way most Americans could never imagine. In an effort, it says, to protect discourse, German authorities have started prosecuting online trolls. And as we saw, it often begins with a pre-dawn wake-up call from the police. \n\nThe reporter was Sharyn Alfonsi — the same one who last month was claiming that Bari Weiss pulling her segment was tantamount to censorship — who just nodded approvingly as the Germans were promoting censorship and jailing those who employed free speech.\n\nIn another report from that program, the one that is claimed to be the pinnacle of unimpeachable journalism, they lied outright. They interviewed a pair of people who were laid off from USAID, amid the DOGE cuts. This pair gave heart-wrenching explanations of the challenges they are facing due to the layoffs. Then they were exposed as not being USAID employees, but high-paid contract consultants, who were connected to former USAID director Samantha Power.\n\nApart from that program, the CBS News division had other notable issues. Margaret Brennan, one morning on Face the Nation, tried to tell Secretary of State Marco Rubio that Hitler rose to power when he “weaponized free speech.” Scott MacFarlane had a report where he was upset that Mexican drug cartels were labeled as a terrorist faction, after showing the display at the DEA headquarters of the 100,000 fentanyl deaths in this country.\n\nGayle King tried to blame a plane crash on Trump administration policies, and the head of Delta Airlines had to guide her through the disqualifying detail that the crash she cited took place in Canada. On the trans athlete issue, the network covered a female fencer who declined a contest because she would not compete against “an opponent she says is trans”; that same opponent competed the year prior in the men's division, so using the trans label is more than suggestive. In a charming move, ahead of the No Kings protests, the unbiased and non-partisan news division provided links to retailers who were selling anti-Trump merchandise.\n\nThis is an impressively lengthy list of journalistic problems – and they are all contained in the span of the past year. I would like to offer a challenge to all of those who are trying to say Bari Weiss is ruining things and boast that CBS News and 60 Minutes were unimpeachable sources of stellar journalism: \n\nJust how much worse do you think things can get at this network?!\n\nEditor's Note: The mainstream media continues to deflect, gaslight, spin, and lie about President Trump, his administration, and conservatives. \n\nHelp us continue to expose their left-wing bias by reading news you can trust.

The former Celebrity Apprentice host was elected president non-consecutively in 2016 and 2024.\nKeep scrolling for a full breakdown of Clooney and Trump’s history, friendship and more:\nForming a Friendship\nWhile speaking with Variety in 2025, Clooney detailed the nature of his bond with Trump.\n“I’d see him out at clubs and at restaurants. He’s a big goofball,” the actor said. “Well, he was. That all changed.”\nTrump ran for president as a Republican, while Clooney has publicly shared his liberal beliefs.\n“It’s a very trying time,” Clooney told the outlet. “It can depress you or make you very angry. But you have to find the most positive way through it. You have to put your head down and keep moving forward because quitting isn’t an option.”\nAll About Politics\nClooney and Trump’s political ideologies changed the course of their relationship, with the actor even publishing a 2024 op-ed in The New York Times ahead of the general election. Instead of condemning Trump, Clooney spent the entire essay calling for then-President Joe Biden not to seek reelection. (Biden eventually did drop out, endorsing former Vice President Kamala Harris before she lost to Trump.)\n\"I don’t know if it was brave. It was a civic duty,” Clooney later told CNN in June 2025 of publishing the article. “I found that people on my side of the street — I’m a Democrat … in Kentucky, so I get it — when I saw people on my side of the street not telling the truth, I thought that was time.”\nHe added, “The idea of freedom of speech, the specific idea of it is, you can’t demand freedom of speech and then say, ‘But don’t say bad things about me.’ That’s the deal. You have to take a stand. If you believe in it, take a stand, stand for it and deal with the consequences. That’s the rules.”\nLeaving the States\nShortly after speaking with Variety in 2025, news broke that George and wife Amal Clooney were granted French citizenship alongside their two children. Trump, meanwhile, addressed the move days after George’s interview was published.\n“Good News! George and Amal Clooney, two of the worst political prognosticators of all time, have officially become citizens of France,” Trump wrote via his Truth Social platform in December 2025. “[The country] is, sadly, in the midst of a major crime problem because of their absolutely horrendous handling of immigration, much like we had under Sleepy Joe Biden.”\nTrump, also taking aim at Clooney’s 2024 essay, further claimed that George “got more publicity for politics than he did for his very few, and totally mediocre movies.”\n“He wasn’t a movie star at all,” Trump claimed. “He was just an average guy who complained, constantly, about common sense in politics.”\nGeorge Responds to the Drama\nGeorge clapped back after Trump’s social media comments.\n“I totally agree with the current president,” he said in a January 2026 statement, per Variety. “We have to make America great again. We’ll start in November.”\nTrump, who popularized the “Make America Great Again” movement amid his presidential campaigns, will not be able to seek a third term per the U.S. constitution.","url":"https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/george-clooney-and-donald-trumps-history-explained-through-the-years/","image":"https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/George-Clooney-and-Donald-Trump-History-Explained.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1131px&resize=1200%2C675&quality=62&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-02 16:28:49","author":"Miranda Siwak","authors":["Miranda Siwak"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.062},{"id":390806378,"title":"George Clooney gets French citizenship — and another dust-up with Trump","text":"One of Hollywood's most recognizable stars is now officially a French citizen.\n\nA French government bulletin published last weekend confirms that the country has granted citizenship to George Clooney, along with his wife, human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, and their 7-year-old twins.\n\nThe Clooneys — who hail from Lexington, Ky. and Beirut, Lebanon, respectively — bought an 18th-century estate in Provence, France in 2021. In an Esquire interview this October, the Oscar-winning actor and filmmaker described the French \"farm\" as their primary residence, a decision he said was made with their kids in mind.\n\n\"I was worried about raising our kids in LA, in the culture of Hollywood,\" Clooney said. \"I felt like they were never going to get a fair shake at life. France — they kind of don't give a s*** about fame. I don't want them to be walking around worried about paparazzi. I don't want them being compared to somebody else's famous kids.\"\n\nIn another interview on his recent Jay Kelly press tour, Clooney mentioned that his wife and kids speak perfect French, joking that they use it to insult him to his face while he still struggles to learn the language.\n\nThis week, after a French official raised questions of fairness, France's Foreign Ministry explained that the Clooneys were eligible under a law that permits citizenship for foreign nationals who contribute to the country's international influence and cultural outreach, The Associated Press reports.\n\nThe French government specifically cited the actor's clout as a global movie star and the lawyer's work with academic institutions and international organizations in France.\n\n\"They maintain strong personal, professional and family ties with our country,\" the ministry added, per the AP. \"Like many French citizens, we are delighted to welcome Georges and Amal Clooney into the national community.\"\n\nThey aren't the only ones celebrating. President Trump, who has a history of trading barbs with Clooney, welcomed the news by taking another dig at the actor.\n\nIn a New Year's Eve Truth Social post, Trump called the couple \"two of the worst political prognosticators of all time\" and slammed Clooney for throwing his support behind then-Vice President Kamala Harris during the 2024 election.\n\n\"Clooney got more publicity for politics than he did for his very few, and totally mediocre, movies,\" wrote Trump, who himself has made cameos in several films over the years. \"He wasn't a movie star at all, he was just an average guy who complained, constantly, about common sense in politics. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\"\n\nClooney responded the next day via a statement shared with outlets including Deadline and Variety.\n\n\"I totally agree with the current president,\" Clooney said, before referencing the midterm elections later this year. \"We have to make America great again. We'll start in November.\"\n\nClooney and Trump — once friendly — have long criticized each other\n\nClooney, a longtime activist and Democratic Party donor, has remained active in U.S. politics despite his overseas move.\n\nIn July 2024, he rocked the political establishment by publishing a New York Times op-ed urging then-President Joe Biden — for whom he had prominently fundraised just weeks prior — to drop his reelection bid to make way for another Democrat with better chances of taking the White House. A growing chorus of calls led to Biden's withdrawal from the race by the end of that month.\n\nIn a December interview with NPR's Fresh Air, Clooney said his decision to speak out on that and other issues generally comes down to \"when I feel like no one else is gonna do it.\"\n\n\"You'll lose all of your clout if you fight every fight,\" he added. \"You have to pick the ones that you know well, that you're well informed on, and that you have some say and you hope that that has at least some effect.\"\n\nClooney has been a vocal critic of Trump throughout both of his terms, most recently on the topic of press freedoms during the actor's Broadway portrayal of the late journalist Edward R. Murrow last spring.\n\nAnd Trump has been similarly outspoken in his dislike of Clooney, including in an insult-laden Truth Social post — calling him a \"fake movie actor\" — after the publication of his New York Times op-ed.\n\nIn December, just days before this latest dust-up, Clooney shared in a Variety interview that he and Trump had been on good terms during the president's reality television days. He said Trump used to call him often and once tried to help him get into a hospital to see a back surgeon.\n\n\"He's a big goofball. Well, he was,\" Clooney added. \"That all changed.\"\n\nIn the same Variety interview, Clooney — the son of longtime television anchor Nick Clooney — slammed CBS and ABC for abandoning their journalistic duty by paying to settle lawsuits with the Trump administration. He expressed concern about the current media landscape, particularly the direction of CBS News under its controversial new editor in chief, Bari Weiss.\n\nWeiss responded by inviting Clooney to visit the CBS Broadcast Center to learn more about their work, in a written statement published in the New York Post on Tuesday. It began with \"Bonjour, Mr. Clooney,\" in a nod to the actor's new milestone.\n\nClooney told NPR last month that he will continue to stand up for what he believes in, even if it means people who disagree with him decide not to see his movies.\n\n\"I don't give up my right to freedom of speech because I have a Screen Actors Guild card,\" he added. \"The minute that I'm asked to just straight-up lie, then I've lost.\"","summary":"The French government says it granted George and Amal Clooney citizenship because of their contributions to its international influence.

In a New Year's Eve post on Truth Social, Trump framed the development as a political failure for both the actor and France.'Good News! George and Amal Clooney, two of the worst political prognosticators of all time, have officially become citizens of France which is, sadly, in the midst of a major crime problem because of their absolutely horrendous handling of immigration,' Trump wrote.The president went further by attacking Clooney's career and political activity. 'Clooney got more publicity for politics than he did for his very few, and totally mediocre, movies,' Trump added, dismissing his standing in Hollywood.Trump also revived criticism of Clooney's 2024 political interventions, referencing his calls for then-President Joe Biden to step aside and his later support for Kamala Harris.Clooney Claps BackClooney responded the following day with a brief but pointed statement that directly echoed Trump's most recognisable slogan. Rather than addressing each accusation, the actor reframed the remark in electoral terms.'I totally agree with the current president. We have to make America great again. We'll start in November,' said Clooney.The wording drew immediate attention because of its timing and simplicity. By repeating Trump's phrase, Clooney signalled disagreement without engaging in a prolonged public exchange, while also emphasising the upcoming midterm elections.What George Clooney MeantClooney's reference to November was widely understood as a nod to the US midterm elections, when Democrats are seeking to retake control of the House and potentially the Senate. Clooney has been an active Democratic supporter and fundraiser for years, and his statement aligned with that history.The actor has also explained that family considerations rather than politics drove his move to France. He has previously cited stronger French privacy laws as a key reason for raising his children there, saying they offer greater protection from intrusive media coverage than in the US.Beyond elections, Clooney has repeatedly linked political leadership to the health of democratic institutions, particularly the press, which he has described as essential to public understanding and accountability.Trump–Clooney Feud ExplainedThe tension between Trump and Clooney did not begin with citizenship. Clooney has said he once knew Trump socially, describing a relationship that later broke down as Trump entered politics.That shift coincided with Clooney becoming more vocal in his criticism of Trump's presidency and legal actions involving major US media organisations.Clooney has argued that settlements reached by broadcasters weakened journalistic independence and has framed those decisions as harmful to democracy.Trump's latest remarks, combining personal criticism with political attack, reignited the feud at a moment when both men are again speaking to voters ahead of a crucial election cycle.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/george-clooney-slams-trump-says-making-america-great-again-will-start-november-if-democrats-1767728","image":"https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1779869/george-clooney-slams-trump-says-making-america-great-again-will.png?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=16bab1c08f90bafc23a760231e2c77b8","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-02 15:13:19","author":"Giuliano de Leon","authors":["Giuliano de Leon"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.278},{"id":390823994,"title":"Trump's Motto in 2025?

Republicans took the race seriously for a variety of reasons, not the least of which was the broader context in the state Capitol: A victory would give the GOP a supermajority in the state legislative chamber.\n\nThat didn’t happen. The Washington Post reported:\n\nA Democrat won a special election for an Iowa state Senate seat Tuesday, denying Republicans the opportunity to regain a supermajority in the chamber and handing the Democratic Party a large-margin victory ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nRenee Hardman, a member of the West Des Moines City Council, received 71.4 percent of the vote in the special-election race for state Senate District 16, according to unofficial results from the Iowa secretary of state. Republican candidate Lucas Loftin received 28.5 percent of the vote in the race, which encompasses a suburban Des Moines jurisdiction.\n\nThat lopsided, 43-point margin of victory was especially notable: The local district is considered an area that favors Democrats, but a year earlier, Kamala Harris’ 2024 ticket won here by 17 points.\n\nIn other words, Hardman, the first Black woman ever elected to the Iowa Senate, didn’t just win, and didn’t just deny Republicans the supermajority it was seeking, she also overperformed to a significant degree.\n\nShe has a lot of company. In elections throughout 2025, Democrats overperformed in ways that should make Republicans quite nervous ahead of the 2026 midterm election cycle.\n\nAround this time a year ago, as Donald Trump prepared to reenter the White House, the conventional wisdom was that Republicans had entered an era of electoral dominance. Trump had successfully realigned the American electorate to put the GOP in a position to control the nation and its future.\n\nThe same commentary held that the Democratic Party wasn’t just defeated, it was also small and divided, with a demoralized and disheartened base, filled with voters who were prepared to withdraw from civic life for a long while.\n\nIn the weeks and months that followed, there was a near-obsessive focus on Democrats and their “brand.” Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado told NBC News in March that his party’s brand was “problematic.” Around the same time, California’s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, said the Democratic brand was “toxic.” Days earlier, Democratic Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania told Politico, “If we don’t get our s––– together, then we are going to be in a permanent minority.”\n\nAs it turns out, there’s been a lot less talk along these lines lately.\n\nThis post updates our related earlier coverage.","url":"https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/why-the-democratic-victory-in-the-final-special-election-of-2025-matters","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/msnow/images/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630/f_auto,q_auto/v1767363071/260102-renee-hardman-zz_11336450fef1_1133645c9c81/260102-renee-hardman-zz_11336450fef1_1133645c9c81.jpg?_i=AA","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-02 14:40:41","author":"Steve Benen","authors":["Steve Benen"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.332},{"id":390951104,"title":"This Past Year Was Pretty Great. Here's a Wish List for 2026","text":"Listening to the usual legacy media suspects, one might think 2025 was an apocalyptic wasteland of sorts -- an authoritarian fever dream brought on by the return of Donald J. Trump to the Oval Office. The reality looked very different. This past year was, in many ways, a pretty great and clarifying one. Let's take stock of what happened when our government remembered whom it serves, as well as what unfinished business remains as we flip the calendar.\n\nFirst, the obvious: Political sanity was restored to the nation's capital. After years of leftist elite-driven chaos -- wide-open borders, hyper-vindictive lawfare, fecklessness on the world stage, and more -- the nation has begun to revert back to first principles: national sovereignty, law and order, and strong leadership abroad. Under Trump, the United States has once again acted like a real nation-state that pursues its real interests -- not a nongovernmental organization with a nagging guilt complex.\n\nThat reorientation has paid huge dividends. On immigration, the Biden-era invasion at the southern border has tapered by more than 90%. On energy, a renewed embrace of domestic production has led to the lowest average national gas prices in nearly five years. Violent crime, thanks to Trump's law enforcement operations and innovative use of the National Guard, has dramatically fallen: Murders decreased by nearly 20% from 2024, and robbery and burglary also saw double-digit percentage decreases. Abroad, allies and adversaries alike recalibrated to the reality that the White House once again means what it says.\n\nStill, work always remains. Here, then, is my 2026 wish list.\n\n1. Peace in Eastern Europe. The Russia-Ukraine war has gone on far, far too long. The Trump administration has exerted tremendous diplomatic effort trying to orchestrate a peace deal, which thus far remains elusive. A durable peace -- one that halts the senseless slaughter on both sides, respects Ukrainian sovereignty and accommodates legitimate Russian concerns, and avoids a wider great-power conflagration -- should be a paramount Trump administration foreign policy goal in 2026. Russia is the invader, and Vladimir Putin is the greater obstacle to a lasting peace, but both sides need to make painful -- if, frustratingly, also painfully obvious -- concessions.\n\n2. Victory on Birthright Citizenship. Back home, a consequential legal battle now sits before the U.S. Supreme Court: the Trump administration's righteous challenge to the erroneous practice of constitutionally \"required\" birthright citizenship for U.S.-born children of illegal aliens. The notion that the 14th Amendment, ratified in 1868 in the aftermath of the Civil War, was meant to constitutionalize a global human trafficking magnet -- granting automatic citizenship to all children born here, including those whose parents entered the country illegally -- is indefensible as a matter of plain constitutional text, the congressional history in the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, and basic common sense. Indeed, birthright citizenship has been nothing short of ruinous for the United States. A Trump administration victory would restore Congress's rightful authority over circumscribing citizenship and remove a longstanding incentive for illegal immigration.\n\n3. Improved Affordability and Housing Costs. Legal victories mean relatively little if ordinary Americans continue to feel like they are getting squeezed. Improved affordability must be front and center in 2026 -- from the federal level down to states and localities. The cost of living is not an economic abstraction; it affects rent, groceries, child care and the difficulty of buying a first home. Housing, in particular, demands attention. Housing policy should reward supply, not suffocate it -- cutting red tape and burdensome construction fees, reforming zoning incentives, and curtailing the inflationary spending that puts upward pressure on mortgage rates. A nation where young families cannot afford to put down roots is a nation courting decline -- the very antithesis of Trumpian restoration.\n\n4. Justice for Minnesota Somali Fraud Scandal. The burgeoning massive fraud scandal over state and federal funds for child care in Minnesota, involving many businesses run by Somali immigrants, has become a test case for whether the rule of law still applies when politics get uncomfortable. Justice means following the facts wherever they lead: recovering stolen taxpayer dollars and holding wrongdoers and abettors legally accountable without fear or favor. To wit, on the subject of abettors: What did Gov. Tim Walz (D-Minn.), Atty. Gen. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and other prominent Minnesota politicians know, and when did they know it? Moreover, what did Kamala Harris -- who picked Walz as her 2024 presidential running mate -- know, and when did she know it? The American people deserve answers to all these questions.\n\n5. Tamed Communist China. Finally, no wish list can be complete without confronting the central geopolitical challenge of our age: that of Communist China. Simply put, Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party, who just presided over their largest live-fire military exercises around Taiwan, must be meaningfully deterred in the Indo-Pacific. That means maintaining a combative tariff posture, implementing as much economic decoupling as is feasible, and emboldening key regional allies -- such as Japan -- who share America's interest in freedom of maritime navigation and diminished Chinese hegemony. Decades from now, Trump's presidential legacy will be partially defined by how he handled the China challenge. Now is not the time to take the foot off the gas pedal.\n\nThis past year showed what is possible when Washington rejects the politics of managed decline and reembraces the best of the American tradition and way of life. Let us hope we will see more -- a lot more -- of that same success in this new year.\n\nEditor’s Note: Support PJ Media’s news coverage and commentary in 2026.

What a ride 2025 was. The stoics tell us the universe is operated by reason and logic, and it takes emotional control to understand this fact.\n\nDonald Trump isn’t a stoic. His philosophy, if indeed he has one, is defined by manipulation — the results of which are apparent to anyone in the United States, no matter their personal philosophy. \n\nTrump demands one way: loyalty. Everyone who works for him knows this. They accept it because they see something in it for themselves — above and beyond whatever societal benefits they think come from Trump’s actions, or their own. There are many others who don’t know Trump, yet they selflessly offer their support because they believe he has the better vision for humanity. Despite what they say publicly, I know of no member of his senior staff who believes that. Their actions tell us otherwise. Many if not all of them have, at one time or another, openly defied and ridiculed the president. But no matter: Their personal enrichment now leads them elsewhere. \n\nHowever manipulative he may be, Trump cannot invent his own universe, take us with him and dwell in it. The universe will ultimately prove him wrong. I submit that it already has. \n\nHis latest public appearance, which came on Dec. 29 with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, not only showed the world how manipulative the pair are, but it also served to highlight the president’s fragile mental and physical health.\n\nThink of how far we have traveled with Trump in the last few years. He used to conduct endless rallies outside of small rural airports where thousands cheered him. Some of these events took place in oppressive heat. Trump would stand and speak with the energy and alacrity of a bad disco dancer on Adderall. Sometimes members of the audience would pass out while he tirelessly ranted about some arcane subject that mattered little, but he would draw applause nonetheless. Now he speaks in nearly empty rooms, or before small groups. He talks less frequently, for shorter lengths of time, and he is often seated when he does so.\n\nI remember standing next to Dr. Sanjay Gupta during a press conference in the Brady Briefing Room during Trump’s first administration. The subject was the president’s annual physical. For more than an hour, members of the press sifted through dozens of pages of test results, asked questions about Trump’s health and gave Dr. Ronny Jackson the opportunity to tell us the president would live to be 200. Going through the paperwork, I turned to Dr. Gupta and said that, while I was no doctor, Trump’s test results resembled my father’s — who had suffered from mild heart disease before he passed. “I am a doctor,” Gupta smiled, before pointing to specific examples of why that was true.\n\nToday? Trump and his administration refuse to have extended press conferences about his health. He claims to not even know where or why he had a recent MRI. Meanwhile he brags about acing three different cognitive tests in the last year. Why has he taken three cognitive tests in the last year? He doesn’t say. \n\nIt’s been nearly eight years since that first presidential health press conference. Does anyone truly believe that Trump, living with the stress of being a vindictive man on a revenge tour and combined with the extraordinary stress of being a president, has done his heart any favors?\n\nThis year could well be a huge turning point in our country due to the failing health of an aging president. In fact, odds are still high that if something were to befall Trump, it would happen while he is gripping a seven-iron and trying to chip himself out of the rough at his favorite golf course.\n\nThe White House is aware of this, and that’s why Vice President JD Vance is on the road, prepping like a second-string quarterback while the starter is wavering on the field. Or, if that metaphor doesn’t appeal to you, how about a late-inning relief pitcher warming up in the bullpen? Vance is the primary example of someone putting their personal distaste for Trump aside in order to personally profit from him. He proves that even if you were a “Never Trump guy,” claimed that Trump was unfit for office or compared him to Adolf Hitler, you can still work for him. You only have to smile and swallow the political swill; there’s potentially a personal pot of gold at the end of the Trump political s**t show. \n\nThe chickens rarely come home to roost for those who stay loyal to Trump — or at least they haven’t yet. Those who dream of Stephen Miller wearing orange, or can’t wait to see FBI Director Kash Patel, Attorney General Pam Bondi or a host of other high Trump officials serving time may one day look back and point to 2026 as the year those things became possible. \n\nWant more sharp takes on politics? Sign up for our free newsletter, Standing Room Only, written by Amanda Marcotte, now also a weekly show on YouTube or wherever you get your podcasts.\n\nThe facts are these: 2026 does not bode well for Trump, his followers or any of us if we continue on the current path. The president is faltering and failing. His enablers, handlers and fans are mistaken in their efforts to support such a feckless, festering, feral fool. They have sacrificed their higher obligation — not to religion or a political party, but to each other. We built an entire civilization through some level of cooperation. Today’s politics is all about tearing things down.\n\nLook ahead to November and the midterm elections. That’s the obvious event that could change the path of our existence. Impeachment looms heavily in the mind of Trump should his MAGA cohorts fail to hold onto Congress. He sends out weekly emails to his supporters warning them of that scenario — and striking fear in his followers once again. Trump knows a Democratic-dominated Congress will not be the geldings his MAGA supporters who dominate today’s chambers are.\n\nBut getting enough Democrats elected means finding candidates who can appeal to enough Americans, something the party has spectacularly — with the exception of Joe Biden — been unable to do since Trump knuckle-crawled onto the political stage.\n\n“The chief task in life is simply this: to identify and separate matters so that I can say clearly to myself which are externals not under my control, and which have to do with the choices I actually control,” said the stoic philosopher Epictetus. “Where then do I look for good and evil? Not to uncontrollable externals, but within myself to the choices that are my own…” \n\nOr, if you are in a 12-step program, you could just grant me the serenity to accept the things I can’t change, the courage to change those that I can and the wisdom to know the difference. That’s where we need to be going as we move into 2026 when it comes to Trump, the MAGA movement and our existential angst.\n\nA year ago we were in the final days of an administration headed by a man some were convinced was sliding into dementia. Biden began his term getting Congress to work together to pass a trillion-dollar infrastructure bill. Things went downhill after that. While you can argue he should never have run for a second term, you also cannot deny the Democrats went along with it until his debate with Trump. After that, the party kicked him to the curb like an unwanted mongrel. Out of fear and panic, Democrats ate their own, and after making a big political meal out of Biden, their standard bearer, Trump’s GOP could not stop grinning at the Democrats as they brought in Vice President Kamala Harris to challenge Trump.\n\nAnd so here we are, staring at a world of injustice, which, according to Marcus Aurelius, “lies in what you aren’t doing, not only in what you are doing.”\n\nDo not decline to get involved. It’s not enough to avoid doing evil. You must be a force for good in the world, as best you can. If that’s hard to understand, then look to former President Jimmy Carter, who echoed those stoic thoughts in a modern world when he said, “I have one life and one chance to make it count for something. My faith demands that I do whatever I can, wherever I am, whenever I can, for as long as I can.”\n\nThat might even appeal to some Christians. \n\nTrump, not being a stoic — and while happily exploiting Christians — is still enjoying his revenge tour, which will continue as long as he is able to stand upright, or to speak while seated. On Tuesday he vetoed two bipartisan infrastructure-related bills. One of the bills would help lower the price of a water pipeline in Colorado. Trump said his veto restored “economic sanity.” Those who need the water pipeline might see things differently.\n\nTrump also got the go-ahead from a U.S. appeals court that allows him to strip Medicaid funding from Planned Parenthood health centers in 22 states and Washington, D.C., an effort that was part of his One Big Beautiful Bill. The court action may make the president happy, but it does nothing to abate the anger millions have against him. \n\nAs a nation, our biggest challenge going into 2026 is to overcome our anger with each other. Anger won’t solve our problems; it will only cause more. When we lived in caves, we learned to band together to help each other. We became apex predators not because of individualism but because of a sense of community.\n\nExtinction is the norm on this planet. If we have any hope of avoiding it, then we must work together as one community. Label it whatever you wish, but the science is sound on this subject — and it is obvious that, by denying science, we’ve taken a pronounced step backward and are hastening our own demise.\n\nMy wish for 2026 is that we take a step forward in a different philosophical direction. My concern is that Trump’s failing health will ultimately be a breaking point for the anger on both sides of the political aisle.\n\nMy hope? A stoic understanding of our responsibility to each other that will allow us to move beyond our current existential crisis. Space travel. Peace. Good rock n’ roll. Better movies. Fun at the Kennedy Center. Cities on the moon, Mars and elsewhere as we tame and inhabit our solar system. \n\nAt the very least, I hope we don’t explode into a paroxysm of violence that consumes the world.","summary":"Even as he falters, 2026 will be a make-or-break year for the president — and the country","url":"https://www.salon.com/2026/01/02/buckle-up-trump-is-not-putting-on-the-brakes/","image":"https://www.salon.com/app/uploads/2025/09/Donald-Trump-2234916805-150x150.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-02 14:00:54","author":"Brian Karem","authors":["Brian Karem"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.012},{"id":390789212,"title":"‘Sissy football is bad for America!’: The A to Z of Donald Trump’s sporting year","text":"A – Alienating-the-Base: “We have to come up with another name for the NFL stuff. It really doesn’t make sense, when you think about it, it isn’t really football.” If Maga knew that Donald Trump was up for calling ‘soccer’ ‘football’, and renaming “the NFL stuff”, they’d have voted for Mao Zedong last year.\n\nB – Bad Blood: Has Trump forgiven Taylor Swift for endorsing Kamala Harris? Has he heck. How sad was he to hear her booed at the Super Bowl in February? Not a lot. “The only one that had a tougher night than the Kansas City Chiefs was Taylor Swift! She got BOOED out of the Stadium. MAGA is very unforgiving!”\n\nC – Cristiano: The Ronaldo man was invited to the White House this year, and oh to have been a fly on those Oval Office walls. “That’s my main objective: to meet Donald Trump and talk about world peace,” he had said. “If I get the chance to sit down with him, I’ll tell him what we have in common.” There might have been tension in the air, though. Who’s the most famous? “Me or Donald Trump? I think worldwide, even in small islands, they know me more than him. In the world, no one is more famous than me.”\n\nD – Doubters: When Trump claimed he had won “36 Club Championships!” in golf, Rick Reilly, author of Commander in Cheat: How Golf Explains Trump, was a touch sceptical. “Number of ‘championships’ he said he had last time: 24. Number he says he suddenly has now: 36. Number that his twisted ego just skipped: 11. Number of actual “championships” he’s won: 0. #CommanderInCheat.”\n\nE – Everybody Needs Good Neighbours: After his imposition of hefty tariffs, Trump dismissed any notion that co-hosting the World Cup with Canada and Mexico would make things awkward. “Tension is a good thing, it makes it much more exciting!” (Come November: “Would I launch strikes in Mexico to stop drugs? Okay with me.”) \n\nF – Fit for Office: The best line from the, um, independent medical report on the status of Trump’s health? “President Trump’s days include participation in multiple meetings, public appearances, press availability, and frequent victories in golf events.”\n\nG – Gushiest: Many a tribute was paid to Trump during the year (most of them by himself), but none quite topped the one offered by Bryson DeChambeau after his visit to the White House. “In my era, Tiger is the ultimate competitor and somebody that is rarely unfazed. You could just tell there was a different presence – much like yourself, Mr President. You walk into an area and it’s just different. And he just had that aura about him.”\n\nH – Healthy Arms: “You faced down adversity, you entered the playoffs battered and bruised, but not broken. When you ran out the healthy arms, you ran out of really healthy ... they had great arms, but they ran out. It’s called sports. It’s called baseball in particular and pitchers I guess you could say, really particular…” To this day, World Series winners the LA Dodgers are none the wiser about the tribute Trump paid to them during their White House visit. \n\nI – Informed: “I remember watching Pelé on a team called the Cosmos. I assume he is one of the greats?”\n\nJ – Juve: The Juventus squad visited the White House on the eve of the Club World Cup, and left looking befuddled. “I was caught by surprise, honestly,” said US international Timothy Weah. “It was a bit weird. When he started talking about the politics with Iran and everything, it’s kind of like, I just want to play football man.” Manuel Locatelli was left even more discombobulated after Trump pointed at him and said: “Some of these guys behind me ... if they come legally, we want them. They have to say they love America, they love our country. And if they can’t say that, we don’t want them.”\n\nK – Kicking Off: How did he feel about the NFL’s new ‘woke’ ‘dynamic kick-off’? “Ridiculous. How can they make such a big and sweeping change so easily and quickly. It’s at least as dangerous as the ‘normal’ kick-off, and looks like hell. It’s the exact opposite of what football is all about. Sissy football is bad for America, and bad for the NFL!”\n\nL – LA: “The governors are going to have to behave! If we think there’s going to be any sign of any trouble, I would ask Johnny to move it to a different city.” At which point Gianni ‘Johnny’ Infantino gulped, Trump threatening to take away World Cup hosting rights from cities run by Democrats, most notably Los Angeles. From my ‘cold dead hands’ was the gist of California governor Gavin Newsom’s response.\n\nM – Master: “I have to congratulate Rory,” said Trump after McIlroy’s triumph in Augusta. “That took tremendous courage. People have no idea how tough that is, that hundredth of an inch makes a difference between a great shot and a horrible shot.” (Unless you have an assistant who’ll move your ball a several hundredths of an inch. Allegedly.)\n\nN – Notorious: On being asked who was his favourite Irish person: “I do happen to like your fighter. He’s got the best tattoos I’ve ever seen. Conor’s great, right?” Taoiseach Micheál Martin, sitting alongside Trump in the White House, turned a whiter shade of pale. \n\nO – Omnipresent: No one was more confused than Cole Palmer when Trump remained on the podium after the presentation to Chelsea of the Club World Cup, and ended up swallowed by a sea of celebrating footballers. “I was a bit confused, yes. He said his son is my biggest fan. I can’t remember what I said. I think it was ‘thank you’ or something.”\n\nP – Peace Prize: People were generally quite rude about Trump being awarded Fifa’s inaugural “Fisher-Price” (credit: random Twitterer) peace prize. Jon Stewart? “An entirely fictitious golden butt plug.”\n\nQ – Queues: His attendance at the US Open men’s tennis final created the mother of all mayhem, the added security measures causing the match to be delayed for 45 minutes – and even then, there were still lines of spectators waiting to get in. Did that prompt them to boo him when he appeared on the big screen? Or was that “fake news”, as the White House’s ‘Rapid Response’ Twitter account claimed? The “losers’ pea-sized brains have been irreversibly destroyed by TDS [‘Trump Derangement Syndrome’],” they said. A mixture of boos and cheers? You decide. \n\nR – Rounds (and Rounds): The busiest folk of the year? Perhaps those who run didtrumpgolftoday.com. Last we checked, they estimated he’d golfed 79 days out of his first 338 days since returning to office (23.4 per cent of his presidency) at an estimated cost – security, transport, etc – of $110,600,000 to the taxpayer.\n\nS – Size Matters: Trump was, as we know, chuffed to receive the inaugural Fifa Peace Prize, but according to the London Times, it didn’t prevent the White House issuing several demands before he received it. Chief among them was that his trophy be at least the size of the World Cup, ie 14½ inches tall and made of 18‑carat gold. \n\nT – Trans Debate: “Could a woman make your team, fellas,” he asked the Juventus men’s squad. Their faces read: “Eh ...” \n\nU – UFC: Yes, the White House will become a venue for the ‘sport’ in 2026. “On the grounds of the White House! We have a lot of land there! We are going to have a UFC fight, championship fight, full fight, like 20-25,000 people!” This is what Abraham Lincoln died for.\n\nV – Vlad: It was a case of ‘To Russia With Love’ when Trump was joined by Gianni ‘Johnny’ Infantino in the Oval Office for an announcement about the World Cup draw. “I thought you’d all like to see it,” said Trump, producing a photo of himself and Vladimir Putin. “I thought it was a nice picture of him. Nice of him. That was very nice, that it was sent to me.” He may be coming [to the World Cup], and he may not,” he added, perhaps unaware that Russia had been banned from the tournament.\n\nW – Wordsmith: Had Trump ever seen a sporting team draw level in a contest? When speaking about the ‘regulating’ of drug prices, he said: “So basically what we are doing is equalising. It’s a new word that I came up with, which I think is probably the best word. We’re gonna equalise!”\n\nX – X-rated: The gist of the response from an unnamed Washington Commanders source when it was reported that Trump had asked that their new $3.7 billion stadium be named after him.\n\nY – YMCA: In honour of Trump, who attended the Washington Commanders v Detroit Lions NFL game in November, Lions receiver Amon-Ra St Brown celebrated a touchdown by doing that YMCA jiggle. How impressed was the Commanders’ Daron Payne? He punched St Brown, got sent off and picked up a suspension. Not much, then. \n\nZ – Zzzzz: There were, indeed, times at the US Open final between Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner that it appeared like Trump was nodding off, tennis possibly not being his thing. And he didn’t seem overly enthused by Alcaraz’s triumph. (Martina Navratilova: “Never saw Trump clap. Not once. He is so jealous!!! And when the whole place erupted, clapping for Bruce Springsteen while playing Born in the USA it was magical!!!”)","summary":"2025 was another year filled with perplexing, not-so-sporting remarks from the US president","url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/2026/01/03/the-a-to-z-of-the-sporting-year-according-to-donald-trump/","image":"https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/v2/2UNHCFBXNRHBXJCMLZIRUQPIPY.jpg?auth=2d9de5cb4a4ce93f510d9e18c57b7c7175c2323a7fc6a008ff71cc703840bc93&smart=true&width=1600&height=900","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-02 13:00:26","author":"Mary Hannigan","authors":["Mary Hannigan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ie","sentiment":-0.084},{"id":390768676,"title":"A year of hate from the far left and right is a wake-up call for US Jews","text":"America is a place and a people. America is an ideal and a dream. This was the year when the lines between the party of reality and the party of fantasy sharpened for all Americans. As usual, those lines cut across the lines of political allegiance. As usual, the Jews were in the thick of it. In physical reality, Israel won its multi-front war against the Iranian-led alliance. In the compensatory dreamland of the digital world, the war against the Zionists goes on. Incitement and attacks against American Jews went through the roof after October 7. In 2025, they rose further. The murder in May of two Israeli embassy staffers in Washington, DC by a gunman who shouted “Free Palestine” was the tip of an increasingly visible iceberg. In June, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) claimed that 55 per cent of Jewish Americans reported “experiencing some form of antisemitism in the last year.” Nearly one in five (18 per cent) said they had been physically threatened or verbally harassed. A third (36 per cent) witnessed “actual or threatened antisemitic violence”. One in five said that they had removed “distinctively Jewish” items since October 7. But 84 per cent of those affected by antisemitism said they were making “some positive change” because of it. Jewish schools, shuls and community centres now have armed guards and concrete “diversity barriers”. But by March, nearly a third (31 per cent) said their engagement with Jewish life had deepened year-on-year – and that was after the 43 per cent increase in the year after October 7. Jewish Federations call it “the Surge”. October 7 and the war against the Jews on America’s streets, campuses and social media have worked like spiritual and political Ozempic. It’s early days, but if the age of Jewish American safety and comfort is over, then so is the age of zombie liberalism and multicultural flab. The ADL are among the slobs who are finally waking up to what is happening – and how the major Jewish organisations sleepwalked their people into a nightmare. In December, a dozen former ADL officials told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency how their worldview and communal strategy collapsed. “We stood up for the LGBTQ community, for the African American community, for immigrants, and it was a real core part of our mission,” said Joe Berman, who had been one of the ADL’s top litigators. “We would often do it in coalition with other civil rights groups, and that’s all gone. That respect that we had is just completely gone.” As my friend Seth Mandel, one of the heroes of the digital war for truth, wrote in Commentary, these officials “appear to be frozen in time on October 6, 2023”. American Jewish leaders thought they could Tikkun Olam their way to a top spot in the priorities of the Democratic Party. The ADL in particular pushed talking points on partisan issues such as abortion, immigration and DEI. They pushed to impose a Palestinian state on Israel too, and called Donald Trump a white supremacist. They pushed their own people into the firing line. They wasted time, money and credibility on backing activists who would, Mandel writes, “like to see us pushed into the sea”. We will be “forced to win this battle with a greatly reduced roster of allies”. The good news is, the Jews who get it aren’t going to give up, and the non-Jews who get it are with us all the way. Expect 2026 to be a year of strengthening alliances with old friends and building links with new friends. That will require a new set of Jewish institutions, and a new understanding of Jewish politics. The old argument that Israel is a liberal democracy with Gay Pride marches and Holocaust survivors is losing its purchase. Not because it’s not true, but because it’s not smart. The generation that remembers the Second World War and the Shoah is almost gone: Norman Podhoretz, one of its greatest writers, died in the last weeks of the year. Americans are tired of the world. As Trump’s tariffs show, Americans want a better deal from their friends. In 2026, Israel’s supporters will need to argue the realist case. Israel is a hub of hi-tech and military ingenuity amid a region of amateur jihadists and tribal kleptocrats. Its strength is the cornerstone of America’s new Middle East. It has proved that it can fight its corner. It is America’s most reliable, competent and powerful ally – more than Britain. *** The year began with the return to office of Donald Trump. In the future, historians will be baffled how, at a time when they faced a multifaceted and violent campaign to drive them from public life, only about 30 per cent of Jewish Americans voted for the candidate whose record included extending the Civil Rights Act to cover Jews and recognising Israeli sovereignty on the Golan Heights and in Jerusalem. Instead of the most pro-Israel president in American history, American Jews voted 70-30 for Kamala Harris, who had defended the Biden administration’s slow-walking of arms to Israel as it fought for its survival and encouraged the Black Lives Matter movement, which was explicitly hostile to Jews. For a clever people, we have a lot of fools. The good news? More and more Jewish Americans now understand that this is a luxury they can no longer afford. If you want to know how things would now stand with President Harris in the White House, see what she said this year. She boasted that she was “the first” high-level official to “talk about the fact that people in Gaza were starving” – without mentioning that Hamas was controlling the flow of aid, and without querying the famine myth. In October, Harris told MSNBC that Israel had killed so many children and innocent civilians in Gaza that it was time to “step back and be honest” about the allegation of “genocide”. Another lie. By December, even Hamas’s health ministry had admitted that adult men of military age comprised somewhere between 52 per cent and 75 per cent of the deaths in the Gaza war. The Biden administration had forced Israel to fight a slow and limited war. Biden and his carers cut off some arms supplies, threatened consequences if Israel crushed Hamas in Gaza, and let two-faced Qatar set the pace of hostage negotiations. The second Trump administration changed all this within days of taking office. It opened the arms spigot to Israel, ran diplomatic cover, allowed Israel to win the war in Gaza and – crucially – worked closely with Israel to strike the head of the snake. Israel’s successful Gaza campaign and Donald Trump’s levelling of Iran’s nuclear programme with American air power created the opening for the exit from the Gaza war in October. The terms bind all of America’s regional clients into a new, American-led order in the heart of the global energy market. What happened next was astonishing. In November 2024, Trump had given the Republicans the trifecta (the House, the Senate and the White House), as well as the popular vote. The Iran strike and the Gaza deal restored America as the arbiter of western Asia and the energy business. But in November 2025, the party fell into civil war. A minority of pols, think-tankers and pundits – some isolationist, some pro-Iran and pro-Qatar, some just plain anti-Jewish – launched the opening round of the struggle for the post-Trump Republican Party and the 2028 nomination. This loud but small faction attacked Israel’s role in American foreign policy as a way of displacing Jews from American life, and attacked individual American Jews, especially conservatives and Republicans, as a way of splitting the America-Israel alliance. Their leaders were Tucker Carlson who, after being fired from Fox News in 2023, had reinvented himself as a “just asking questions” podcaster in his Maine woodshed; and Nicholas Fuentes, a grubby racist whose digital stand-up routines had attracted an audience of resentful white youths who called themselves Groypers. Carlson, Fuentes and their hangers-on were backed by a surge of online racism. In December, the Network Contagion Institute reported that the engagement numbers were confected by foreign bots. Much of the genuine audience was also foreign, in the kind of countries where morbid Jew-hatred never went away. Still, it was real enough to blow up the biggest think-tank in DC, the Heritage Foundation, as its trustees resigned over its continued support for Carlson. And because he is tight with Vice President JD Vance, it may yet blow up Vance too. Trump dismissed Carlson as “kooky”. But Vance stuck with Carlson and told Republicans to stop the “infighting”. A lot of Americans think that fighting racists is a good thing. A lot also think that open borders, imperial wars and decadent liberalism have driven the country to the lip of chaos and bankruptcy – and that liberal Jewish organisations and media voices backed that march of folly. In 2026, we shall see how this shakes out. I believe that Americans are on the whole good people who like Jews and hate the enemies of America. Meanwhile, Jewish Americans face a wave of pitchfork paranoia and thuggery reminiscent of the Middle Ages, had America been around then. *** America is undergoing a wave of domestic terrorism. Some of it is the fallout from the Great Awokening, as leftist groups spiral over the edge from performative alienation to genuine terrorism. Some of it is from the Islamists who used the Great Awokening to advance their idea of identity politics. On the first night of Chanukah, gunmen shot up a house in Los Angeles while shouting “Free Palestine”. On the second night, two men attacked Orthodox Jews on a subway train while bystanders did nothing. At dusk before the third night, an Orthodox man was stabbed in the street in Brooklyn. New York City police reported a surge in anti-Jewish attacks after the Bondi Beach massacre. It’s called “network contagion”. No one has any idea how to stop it, apart from massive censorship. That is a bad idea, and impossible in the land blessed with the First Amendment. In 2025, America continued to undergo a wave of speech liberalisation after the ideological favouritism and digital censorship of the Obama and Biden years. The blessing and the curse after Elon Musk’s purchase of Twitter, now X, is that Jewish Americans have a chance to make their realist case. But the racists and fantasists have the numbers, while X profits from their anti-American lies and incitement. We also have Bari Weiss. And Bari now has an eight-man security detail that costs $10,000 a day, and travels in a military-style convoy of SUVs. Why? Because she defends the Jews. Her takeover of CBS News shows that the revival of the centre ground is beginning, and that pro-Israel Jews can make it happen. It will get worse for American Jews before it gets better. But I believe, as Americans of all stripes believe, that it will get better. Americans are stronger than they realise. The American system is more adaptive than we think. Jewish Americans are stronger and more adaptive than they knew. The diaspora’s biggest and richest community is only now starting to flex its financial, political and spiritual muscles. In 2026, we will start to see the results.","url":"https://www.thejc.com/opinion/a-year-of-hate-from-the-far-left-and-right-is-a-wake-up-call-for-us-jews-whje3vss","image":"https://api.thejc.atexcloud.io/image-service/view/acePublic/alias/contentid/1o6m0l5659udgryvk01/0/copy-of-gettyimages-2216591799-jpg.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-02 12:24:11","author":"Dominic Green","authors":["Dominic Green"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.307},{"id":390767550,"title":"George Clooney fires back after Trump slams his French citizenship","text":"George Clooney and Amal Clooney are now French citizens (Picture: Taylor Hill/Getty Images)\n\nGeorge Clooney has fired back at Donald Trump after the President of the United States criticised him for getting French citizenship.\n\nThe 64-year-old Hollywood star and his wife Amal, 47, have become French citizens as they join the growing list of A-listers ditching the US.\n\nAFP revealed that soon after Christmas, the couple – who have been married since 2014 and in 2021 purchased a stunning provade abode in Provence, France – and their eight-year-old twins, Alexander and Ella, made it official.\n\nAfter the news, Trump took to his Truth Social page on New Year’s Eve and ranted: ‘Good News!

It began with the election of a new House speaker for a regular legislative session that saw Gov. Greg Abbott secure his landmark private school voucher program and Republicans check off priorities ranging from tighter bail laws to a ban on land sales to people from certain foreign countries.\n\nThe year also brought the devastating July 4 Hill Country floods, which killed over 130 people, including dozens of children and counselors at Camp Mystic along the Guadalupe River. Lawmakers responded by passing a series of bipartisan bills meant to bolster the state’s flood infrastructure and disaster response and improve the safety of camps located in or near floodplains.\n\nDuring the same overtime legislative session, the GOP-controlled Legislature approved a new congressional map demanded by President Donald Trump and designed to hand the GOP up to five additional seats in the U.S. House during this year’s midterms. Republicans pushed the new lines through over intense opposition from House Democrats, who fled the state to temporarily deny the headcount necessary to pass legislation. A panel of federal judges initially blocked the map before it was restored by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nWith 2025 behind us, The Texas Tribune’s politics team has compiled five of the top political stories we are watching in 2026, when voters will have their first chance to make their opinions known on the events of the last 12 months.\n\nWho will claim Texas’ Senate seat?\n\nSen. John Cornyn is facing his toughest reelection bid yet after decades as a U.S. senator from Texas, battling in a three-way Republican primary that has already turned contentious.\n\nCornyn and Attorney General Ken Paxton, two powerhouses in Texas Republican politics, have been slinging mud at each other for months after Paxton announced his Senate bid in April. Challenging Cornyn from his right, Paxton has alleged that the state’s senior senator is out of touch with grassroots voters in Texas and is insufficiently conservative. Cornyn and his allies have already spent tens of millions touting his loyalty to President Donald Trump on the airwaves. And the senator is banking on a bevy of Paxton scandals turning voters off, from the bribery allegations underpinning his 2023 impeachment in the Texas House to his wife divorcing him on “biblical grounds” this summer.\n\nU.S. Rep. Wesley Hunt, a second-term GOP congressman from Houston, complicated the race further with his October entry. Hunt is pitching himself to voters as a younger alternative to either candidate with MAGA credentials — but without the ethical baggage. With three prominent candidates, the Republican primary seems likely to head to a runoff and drag out through May.\n\nOn the Democratic side, two candidates are vying for the opportunity to do what has proven impossible for the past 30 years — win a statewide race in Texas. Dallas U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett and Austin state Rep. James Talarico emerged from a lengthy list of interested candidates to compete in the March primary. Democrats, enthusiastic about a midterm election in a Trump year and taking advantage of Republicans’ bruising primary, are bullish on the Senate race. The last time Trump was in the White House but not on the ballot, Democrats came within three percentage points of taking down Sen. Ted Cruz.\n\nBut any statewide contest in Texas is still an uphill climb for a Democrat. And with several competitive downballot races in November, particularly in South Texas, Crockett or Talarico hope to carry other Democrats in House, legislative and municipal races across the finish line as well.\n\n— Gabby Birenbaum\n\nThe race to replace Ken Paxton\n\nWho will be Texas’ next top lawyer? For the first time in more than a decade, it’s guaranteed that Ken Paxton won’t be taking the title. Paxton, who is forgoing reelection to run for Senate, has turned Texas’ attorney general’s office into the conservative legal movement’s strongest state-level ally. Under his leadership, the agency has found new and more creative ways to advance conservative goals, block liberal policies and ensnare nonprofits, corporations and even state agencies in costly, contentious litigation. \n\nNow, four Republicans are vying to take the reins in what promises to be an expensive and potentially bruising primary. U.S. Rep. Chip Roy, R-Austin, leads the pack on name recognition and touts a valuable endorsement from his former boss, Sen. Ted Cruz. State Sen. Mayes Middleton, R-Galveston, one of the Legislature’s most conservative members and a top GOP donor, is pouring millions of his own money into his race. State Sen. Joan Huffman, R-Houston, is running on her experience as a prosecutor and judge. Aaron Reitz, Paxton’s former right-hand man who left the Trump Department of Justice to run for the seat, is touting Paxton’s endorsement and Trump’s claim that he is a “true MAGA attorney.” \n\nOn the Democratic side, three candidates are fighting to reclaim the office after 30 years of Republican ownership. State Sen. Nathan Johnson, D-Dallas, is running on his experience as a litigator and legislator. Former Galveston Mayor Joe Jaworski, who ran unsuccessfully for the nomination last cycle, is back again. And Dallas attorney Tony Box, a veteran and former FBI agent and prosecutor, is selling himself as the political newcomer the party needs. \n\n— Eleanor Klibanoff\n\nWill Latino voters swing back to the Democratic column?\n\nPerhaps no voter bloc in 2026 will receive as much attention as Latino voters in Texas. \n\nIn recent years, the GOP has made inroads with Latinos along the U.S.-Mexico border in Texas and in the state’s largest metros. President Donald Trump advanced those gains in 2024, almost sweeping the border counties — some of which had not voted for a Republican presidential nominee in more than a century — and complicating assumptions that Latinos are loyal Democrats. \n\nNow the big question will be whether that support for the president and Republicans will remain in place. Early evidence suggests that it might already be in peril. \n\nThe Trump administration’s massive immigration crackdown has injected fear into Latino communities from the Rio Grande Valley to Lubbock, with anecdotal disapproval from some who sense a betrayal from the president’s campaign promises to deport only hardened criminals. Part of the support for the president also stemmed from a belief that he would help the economy. A year into his presidency, many still feel like the cost of getting by has not improved.\n\nBut it is not that simple. A Pew Research Center study of Latinos across the country, released in November, found that while many are increasingly critical of the president, a large divide remains based on how people voted in 2024. A large majority of Latino voters, 81%, who supported Trump still back him and his policies, a slight decrease from the 93% at the start of the president’s second term, according to the study.\n\nThe stakes are high. For one, Texas Republicans redrew the state’s congressional districts with an aim of netting the GOP three to five more seats in the U.S. House. Three of those seats were reconfigured to add Hispanic voters, though critics charge that the districts were drawn to appear as though Republicans are banking on support from Hispanic voters, when in fact they are insulating themselves from that voting bloc, with new lines that rely on continued low rates of Hispanic turnout. \n\n— Alejandro Serrano\n\nThe new congressional map\n\nPresident Donald Trump this summer asked Texas to pass a congressional map creating five new GOP-leaning districts. However, Republicans aren’t guaranteed to win them all, and political consultants on both sides of the aisle believe Republicans will come up short of five flips in 2026.\n\nDemocrats have their eyes on three of the five seats. Trump would have carried each of the three by 10 percentage points in 2024, but that was in a particularly strong year for Republicans, and the party in the White House typically sees blowback in a midterm year like 2026.\n\nTwo of the three closest seats are similar to border districts currently represented by Democrats. Both Laredo U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar in the 28th Congressional District and McAllen U.S. Rep. Vicente Gonzalez in the 34th Congressional District outperformed Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024, winning reelection even as Trump carried their districts. Cuellar in particular has a track record of outperforming other Democrats, even when facing legal problems. Trump pardoned Cuellar of his bribery charges this month, complicating the 2026 picture.\n\nThe third 10-point Trump seat, the 35th Congressional District, is a new San Antonio-based seat with no incumbent on the ballot. The leading Republicans there are Carlos De La Cruz and state Rep. John Lujan, but the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee added the seat to its list of “districts in play” this month. Strategic adviser John Lira and Bexar County Sheriff’s deputy Johnny Garcia are two of the biggest Democrats in that race.\n\nBeyond CD 35, the redrawn district lines created several primary contests across the state. In the Houston area, a new red-leaning seat, the 9th Congressional District, features Deer Park state Rep. Briscoe Cain, former Harris County judge GOP nominee Alex Mealer and others. Gov. Greg Abbott endorsed Cain in that race.\n\nIn North Texas’ red-leaning 32nd Congressional District, businessman and pastor Ryan Brinkley and former state Senate candidate Jace Yarbrough are among the biggest names in the crowded Republican primary.\n\nCD 9’s current representative, Houston U.S. Rep. Al Green, is running in the Democratic primary for the 18th Congressional District, which overlaps with part of the district Green currently holds. He’ll fight two candidates who are currently in the special election runoff for the existing CD 18, former Houston City Council member Amanda Edwards and Harris County Attorney Christian Menefee.\n\n— Renzo Downey\n\nWill a blue wave sweep the legislative races?\n\nWith President Trump’s approval rating low, Democrats are hoping that backlash to his administration will prompt a blue wave next year and help the party eat into the GOP’s dominance in Texas.\n\nDemocrats are campaigning in every federal and state race on the ballot next year, hoping that running candidates everywhere will maximize the party’s chances of flipping seats while ginning up engagement to boost statewide candidates at the top of the ticket.\n\nIn the Texas House, the House Democratic Campaign Committee is leading the effort to flip GOP-controlled districts. The HDCC is initially planning to target four seats Democrats tried and failed to turn in 2024, and one of the two seats Democrats lost. They are:\n\nHouse District 34, which Rep. Denise Villalobos, R-Corpus Christi, flipped with an 11-percentage point margin\n\nHouse District 37, which Rep. Janie Lopez, R-San Benito, won by 10 points\n\nHouse District 112, which Rep. Angie Chen Button, R-Garland, won by 8 points\n\nHouse District 118, an open seat that Rep. John Lujan, R-San Antonio, won by 3 points\n\nHouse District 121, which Rep. Marc LaHood, R-San Antonio, won by 5 points\n\nThe Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, the national party’s arm targeting state legislative races, also said it plans to put resources into Texas next year for the first time since 2020.\n\nRepublicans currently control 88 out of 150 Texas House seats, meaning Democrats would need to flip 14 seats to win control of the chamber — a Herculean task even under the most favorable conditions.\n\nDemocrats saw their strongest electoral performance in 2018, when they picked up 12 Texas House seats. Since then, they’ve only lost ground, failing to net any districts in 2020 despite a well-funded effort to take control of the lower chamber. After redrawing the district map in 2021, Republicans picked up three Democratic seats in 2022 and two more in 2024.\n\nStill, Democrats are hoping 2026 will more closely resemble 2018, the last Trump midterm election year. And the party’s strong performance across the country in elections in November sparked hopes that a blue wave may indeed be building. \n\n“This is the moment, and we’re going to build an operation that matches the moment, and we’re going to win,” said state Rep. Christina Morales, D-Houston and chair of the HDCC.\n\n— Kayla Guo","summary":"The Texas Tribune’s politics team has compiled five of the top stories we're watching this year, when voters will have their first chance to make their opinions known on the events of 2025.","url":"https://www.texastribune.org/2026/01/02/texas-politics-2026-five-stories-to-watch/","image":"https://www.texastribune.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/US-Senate-Texas.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-02 11:00:00","author":"Eleanor Klibanoff and Alejandro Serrano,Gabby Birenbaum,Kayla Guo,Renzo Downey","authors":["Eleanor Klibanoff and Alejandro Serrano","Gabby Birenbaum","Kayla Guo","Renzo Downey"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.056},{"id":390939934,"title":"Democrats could avoid a lot of trouble with a little ego management","text":"As we head into 2026 and Democrats try to figure out how to regain power, their New Year’s resolution should be simple: Manage egos better. In recent years, they seem to have forgotten the time-tested necessity of placating people. In other words, doing the same basic drudgery the rest of us rely on to get through this chaotic world. This effort cannot merely be directed toward voters, as important as they are. It must also include elite stakeholders, some of whom might (rightly) be considered kooks, weirdos and otherwise high-maintenance eccentrics. Lest you think Dems should simply shrug off these folks and say “good riddance,” consider this: Both Trump terms might have been avoided if Democrats had been more willing to nurture the nuts in years gone by. Let’s start with their treatment of America’s top crank: Robert F. Kennedy Jr. As journalist Michael Scherer, who profiled RFK Jr. for The Atlantic, told Alex Wagner of “Pod Save America”: Once Kennedy’s own 2024 presidential campaign started to flounder, he and his campaign manager began “to make sort of outreach to Democrats … to see if they can open a conversation with Biden to sort of trade something.” Unfortunately, “the Democratic response [was] silence.” They wouldn’t meet with him, they wouldn’t talk to him. Later, as Scherer recounts: “A friend of [Kennedy’s] connects him with Tucker Carlson who connects him with Donald Trump. And that night, just hours later, they’re talking, and Trump at that point wants to make a deal.” The rest is history. Now, I know what you’re thinking. “But Kennedy is a nut! Why should Democrats have humored him?” How about this: Because Trump narrowly won the presidency in 2024 by forming a disparate coalition held together by duct tape, resentment and (possibly) a cursed amulet. This motley crew included more prominent Dems than just RFK Jr. Remember when Biden basically ghosted Elon Musk for that big 2021 White House electric vehicle summit? Even Kamala Harris — who happily agreed with Biden on just about everything except her own polling numbers — called that a huge mistake. Then again, Harris committed her own costly slight when she decided against going on Joe Rogan’s podcast. For an entire decade now, Democrats have consistently alienated allies — with devastating results. I’m talking about the snubs that might have prevented Trump’s first presidential run entirely. Not just the famous humiliation of Trump at the 2011 White House Correspondents’ Dinner. Here’s the more tragic prequel: Former “Meet the Press” host Chuck Todd told the Bulwark’s Tim Miller that before Trump went full birther, he actually called the Obama White House offering “ideas on how to improve the state dinner.” That’s right. Donald J. Trump — future leader of the free world — just wanted to talk about better parties. Shrimp trays. Tablecloths. Maybe a chocolate fountain. Just as the world would have been better had the Washington Senators signed Fidel Castro to a huge baseball contract before he got too interested in politics, America might have been better if Obama had made Trump the White House state dinner czar. But as Todd put it, “The last thing the Obama White House was going to do was placate a guy like Donald Trump.” Understandable — until you consider that the alternative to humoring him was, you know … President Trump. Twice. Look, I totally understand why a U.S. president might think he or she shouldn’t have to stoop to kissing some crank’s ring or placating some gilded, phony billionaire. But let’s be honest: It’s part of the job. Instead of performing this sort of ego cultivation, Democrats — whether because of snobbery, elite gatekeeping, geriatric aloofness or a disciplined disdain for “time burglars” — have repeatedly alienated potential allies (or at least neutral parties). Then they act shocked when these same people drift into the MAGA solar system like space debris. If Trump is truly an existential threat — and Democrats say this approximately 87 times a week — then maybe, just maybe, they should Return. A. Phone. Call. Otherwise, Donald Trump will. Probably at 3 a.m., while eating a Big Mac. So grovel if you must. Fake interest. Smile like you’re not dying inside. Do the basic humiliations the rest of us perform daily to get hired, get promoted or get a date. It’s the least you can do. So make it your New Year’s resolution and honor it. But if you think you’re too good to perform the basic glad-handing and ego-stroking, even for the nuttiest eccentrics, bad things will happen. Trust me — I’ve seen this movie. And we’re only a year into his second term. Matt K.
