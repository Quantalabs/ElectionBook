The Guardian headline read “Republican donors trying to unseat Pittsburgh’s progressive black mayor.”\n\nThe problem for Gainey is that not only has he also taken donations from Republican donors, but he’s taken a greater percentage than O’Connor has.\n\nDemocratic strategist Mike Mikus, who has worked on campaigns for more than three decades, said he finds it astonishing that Gainey would launch an attack on O’Connor on this common practice.\n\n“Republicans have given him 23% of the money he has raised so far. That’s a larger percentage than was given to O’Connor,” said Mikus.\n\nIn total, nearly a quarter of the money Gainey has raised for his reelection has come from at least 42 donations from MAGA Republicans — donors who have also donated to President Donald Trump, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Green (R-GA), Lou Barletta, Dr. Mehmet Oz, Dave McCormick, or Govs. Greg Abbott (R-TX) or Ron DeSantis (R-FL), according to Open Secrets.\n\nRaces for mayor in Pittsburgh have been decided in the primary since the 1930s, when the last Republican held the seat. Four years ago Gainey unseated sitting Democrat Mayor Bill Peduto.\n\nIn conversations with several current and former elected Democrats, all of them said they have taken donations from Republicans for years.\n\nGainey held a press conference at a North Side thrift shop to address the Guardian story, saying, “There is one place I didn’t expect to have to defend the MAGA assault, and that was in the primary race, but unfortunately, this is exactly where we are at. Trump’s MAGA donors, his consultants, and his corporate interests are trying to buy the mayor’s office by attacking me just like they attacked Kamala Harris.”\n\nGainey, a former state representative, has struggled in his role as mayor. He has taken heat for his lack of leadership on simple things like getting the snow plows out during winter storms, to harder issues like crime, homelessness, and economic growth in a city whose business district has all the markings of a ghost town.\n\nIn a private poll taken two weeks ago, a clear majority of Pittsburgh Democrats (55% to 32%) favored O’Connor over Gainey with 14% undecided.\n\nThe survey also showed that a majority believe the city of Pittsburgh is on the wrong track under his leadership.\n\nIn reaction to Hallam’s tweet, local radio host Colin Dunlap admonished her for making the donations about race when clearly Gainey was taking more money from MAGA Republicans than O’Connor. More importantly, Dunlap said Gainey was losing because the city has been run to the ground since he took office. “Keep telling yourself it is about skin color,” Dunlap said.\n\nThe convoluted accusation started to gain national attention when the Intercept ran a similar story to the Guardian, noting, “Now that Republicans have won control of government in Washington they’re shifting their sights to a progressive enclave in Pennsylvania.”\n\nThen anti-gun activist Shannon Watts posted on X, “NEW: Trump’s advisors and donors are meddling in a Democratic primary to oust Pittsburgh’s first black mayor, Ed Gainey. This is a foreshadowing of what’s to come for incumbent Democratic mayors — especially black and brown mayors.”\n\nLocal elected Democrats, some allies of Gainey, some not, rolled their eyes at the donor stories.\n\nOne of those Democrats, who does not live in the city so he has no skin in the game, said, “No, Donald Trump is not trying to come here and take Gainey’s job away from him. Gainey himself took donations from MAGA donors.”\n\n“As for why Gainey is losing in the polling, sadly it has to do with his performance and what the city looks like, none of this has to do with race,” he added.","summary":"PITTSBURGH — The Democratic primary race between incumbent Pittsburgh Mayor Ed Gainey and Corey O’Connor, the Allegheny County controller, has Gainey’s allies crying racism because O’Connor has received donations from Republican donors. “Can’t wait to see the back flips of the Gainey haters have to try to spin this one,” Bethany Hallam, a left-wing county [&#8230;]","url":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/3335901/pittsburgh-mayor-ed-gainey-took-maga-donations-too/","image":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/AP24109771769795.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-04 00:36:30","author":"Salena Zito","authors":["Salena Zito"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.158},{"id":296375934,"title":"Musing About Then vs. Now at Celebration of Katharine Graham","text":"WASHINGTON -- On Sunday evening, as well-heeled guests trickled out of a screening of \"Becoming Katharine Graham,\" a documentary on the fabled former Washington Post publisher, they couldn't help but remark on how much has changed at the paper, and in Washington.\n\nUnder Graham, from 1963 to 1991, the publication transformed itself from a regional newspaper into one of the country's leading journalistic institutions. The film traces her life, focusing on the period she is best known for: standing up to the Nixon administration and publishing the Pentagon Papers, which helped change public opinion about the Vietnam War, and Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein's Watergate reporting, which led to President Richard Nixon's resignation in 1974.\n\nThe premiere was held in a theater at the John F.

Partners, shows his approval rating has ticked up by one point in the past two weeks.\n\nIt now stands at 54 percent, representing a historic high for a president who has polarized the nation.\n\nSome 46 percent of those who expressed an opinion said they disapproved of his performance. \n\nMuch of the increase in approval comes from younger voters, with 56 percent of 18 to 29-year-olds now saying they approve (up from 51 percent two weeks earlier). \n\nIt shows that Trump’s helter-skelter blitz on the federal government has more admirers than critics among voters. So far.\n\nAnd the fieldwork was conducted just before Trump’s extraordinary clash with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday, which could change the way voters see the president.\n\nWhen asked if they now had a more or less positive view of the president, more than one in three Americans (36 percent) said they had a more positive view.\n\nOnly 16 percent said more negative.\n\nRespondents said they were impressed by the way Trump was doing exactly what he said he would do during the campaign.\n\nAnd as one respondent (a New York Democrat and Kamala Harris voter) put it: ‘because he has focused on taking out corruption in the government.’\n\nTrump took office on January 20.\n\nAnd with Elon Musk at his side he has cut a swath through government, shuttering USAID and laying off thousands of workers.\n\nIn the meantime, he has kept up a steady pace of executive orders and international diplomacy. \n\nOn Tuesday he faces one of Washington’s biggest set piece occasions: An address to a joint session of Congress.\n\nHe is expected to take a victory lap of achievements and set out his priorities for the year ahead.\n\nThe DailyMail.com tracker suggests he is on a firmer foundation than some other polls, which indicated his firing blitz and inflation worries had given voters pause for thought. \n\n‘Some pollsters have found Trump’s ratings slipping,’ said James Johnson, cofounder of J.L. Partners. \n\n‘We think this is a reflection of non-response bias rather than reality: Basically, energized Democrats who were not answering polls a month ago now doing so. \n\n‘Our polling was the most accurate in 2024, and we are confident this is the real picture: Trump’s approval rating holding firm rather than slipping.’\n\nThe tracker will publish the latest ratings every month. \n\nThe first instalment is based on a poll of 1,001 registered voters taken between February 24 and 25.\n\nTo get to the final numbers, people who responded ‘don’t know’ were stripped out. (If they are left in, the numbers are 45 percent approve, versus 39 percent who don’t). \n\nIt found that the president’s approval rating had dipped slightly among Republicans (from 92 percent to 89 percent) but risen among Democrats (from 20 percent to 22 percent) and among younger voters (from 51 percent to 56 percent with 18 to 29-year-olds).\n\nRespondent after respondent said that he was keeping his promises.\n\n‘He has accomplished more so far this time than in his first four years,’ said a female Harris voter from Pennsylvania.\n\nA Trump voter from California said: ‘He is more focused and less toxic.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump&#8217;s rapid pace of spending cuts, deportations and foreign policy&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Donald Trump&#8217;s popularity rises in latest poll ahead of Congressional address first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/politics/donald-trumps-popularity-rises-in-latest-poll-ahead-of-congressional-address/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/03/15/95785443-14455729-image-a-1_1741015421863.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-03 23:41:49","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.079},{"id":296365880,"title":"Musing About Then vs. Now at Celebration of Katharine Graham","text":"WASHINGTON -- On Sunday evening, as well-heeled guests trickled out of a screening of \"Becoming Katharine Graham,\" a documentary on the fabled former Washington Post publisher, they couldn't help but remark on how much has changed at the paper, and in Washington.\n\nUnder Graham, from 1963 to 1991, the publication transformed itself from a regional newspaper into one of the country's leading journalistic institutions.

Walz ran alongside former Vice President Kamala Harris on the Democrats' 2024 ticket in the waning months of the election cycle after former President Joe Biden dropped out of the race amid mounting concern over his mental acuity and age.

Some, including Democratic leaders, believe the argument had been planned, an accusation the White House has denied.The incident marked weeks, if not months, of comments Trump has made about Zelensky and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Newsweek has contacted a White House media representative for comment.In a war of words some fear could have dramatic international consequences, Newsweek looks back at Trump's comments about Zelensky since the war in Ukraine began on February 24, 2022.February 26, 2022Trump Calls Zelensky A 'Brave Man'Trump attracted some criticism early in the war for praising Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying Putin had made the \"very savvy\" move of declaring \"independence\" for two Ukrainian regions as a pretext to move what he called \"peacekeeping\" troops into Ukraine.However, at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) on February 26, 2022, two days after Russia's invasion, Trump said Zelensky was a \"brave man, he's hanging in, he's a brave man\" earning a round of applause.At CPAC, Trump also discussed his 2019 impeachment, stemming from allegations that during a phone call on July 25, 2019, Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden while future U.S. military aid was on the line. Trump acknowledged that he discussed the Bidens and accusations of corruption during the call but denied any connection between the conversation and his decision to withhold aid.Trump told the CPAC that he liked Zelensky because \"during that ridiculous impeachment waste of time...the president of Ukraine said he [Trump] did nothing wrong.\"He could have said he did something or he thought, 'Well that wasn't appropriate,' you know, all the crap you have to listen to,\" Trump said. \"He said 'He did absolutely n'...I called him up to congratulate him on his victory. He said, 'He did nothing wrong, he did absolutely nothing wrong.'\"Trump also called the Russian attack on Ukraine \"appalling\" adding: \"We are praying for the proud people of Ukraine. God bless them all.\"April 18, 2022Trump Says Lack Of Peace 'Doesn't Make Sense'Less than two months after the war started, Trump said it didn't \"make sense\" that Russia and Ukraine had not come to a peace agreement. While not speaking directly about Zelensky, Trump's statements nodded to Moscow and Kyiv leadership to settle the violence.\"If they don't do it soon, there will be nothing left but death, destruction, and carnage,\" Trump said in a statement.\"This is a war that never should have happened, but it did. The solution can never be as good as it would have been before the shooting started, but there is a solution, and it should be figured out now—not later—when everyone will be DEAD!\"October 8, 2022Zelensky Is 'Very Honorable'At a political rally in Minden, Nevada, the month before he announced his plans to run for president again, Trump referred to Zelensky as \"very honorable,\" again repeating the story and circumstances following his 2019 impeachment and their phone call.\"And he was very honorable, Zelensky,\" Trump said, claiming Zelensky said there was no intimidation involved in the call.June 27, 2023'I Get Along With Him'Amid his campaign, Trump began to claim that his relationship with Zelensky and Putin was of such strength that he could negotiate a deal to bring the war to an end.Addressing a Republican Women's Lunch in Concord, New Hampshire, on June 27, 2023, Trump said: \"And when they asked Zelensky, which I respect...I tell you what. I get along with him, get along with Putin.\"I'd have that war—it would have never happened under me, never ever, would have never happened. But I'll have that war settled in 24 hours, and it won't even be a tough one by comparison to other things.\"Trump repeated versions of the same claim throughout the campaign. In July 2023, he told Fox News' Maria Bartiromo that his \"very good relationship\" with Zelensky and Putin would serve as a foundation for peace talks.These claims appeared to prompt a response from Zelensky, who told CNN in September 2023: \"He can publicly share his idea now, not waste time, not to lose people, and say, 'My formula is to stop the war and stop all this tragedy and stop Russian aggression.'\"And he said, how he sees it, how to push Russian from our land. Otherwise, he's not presenting the global idea of peace.\"June 27, 2024Zelensky Is 'The Greatest Salesman Ever'Among the earliest signs that Trump may have begun to sour on Ukraine came during the presidential debate with Biden.Asked by moderator Dana Bash which of Putin's terms for peace he would accept, Trump falsely suggested that the U.S. had given Ukraine $200 billion, calling Zelensky \"the greatest salesman ever.\"\"He's [Biden] given $200 billion now or more to Ukraine,\" Trump said. \"He's given $200 billion. That's a lot of money. I don't think there's ever been anything like it. Every time that Zelensky comes to this country, he walks away with $60 billion.\"He's the greatest salesman ever. And I'm not knocking him, I'm not knocking anything. I'm only saying, the money that we're spending on this war, and we shouldn't be spending.\"It should have never happened. I will have that war settled between Putin and Zelensky as president-elect before I take office on January 20th. I'll have that war settled.\"Trump continued to use the \"greatest salesman\" line throughout his campaign.July 12, 2024Biden Calling Zelensky 'Putin' Was 'Unpardonable'Even as Trump began characterizing Zelensky as a \"salesman,\" he said a mistake Biden made introducing Zelensky to a NATO summit as \"Putin\" was \"unpardonable.\"\"But I thought the worst part of the press conference was the moment during the day when he introduced Zelensky, and he introduced him as Vladimir Putin, that was not good,\" Trump said in a radio interview. \"That was unpardonable. You can't do that.\"July 19, 2024Trump Praises 'Very Good Phone Call' With ZelenskyShortly after Trump's first assassination attempt on July 13, 2024, he and Zelensky spoke over the phone, with Trump saying he appreciated Zelensky \"reaching out.\"\"President Zelensky of Ukraine and I had a very good phone call earlier today,\" Trump said on Truth Social. \"He congratulated me on a very successful Republican National Convention and becoming the Republican nominee for President of the United States.\"He condemned the heinous assassination attempt last Saturday and remarked about the American people coming together in the spirit of Unity during these times.\"I appreciate President Zelenskyy for reaching out because I, as your next President of the United States, will bring peace to the world and end the war that has cost so many lives and devastated countless innocent families. Both sides will be able to come together and negotiate a deal that ends the violence and paves a path forward to prosperity.\"August 23, 2024Trump Says Zelensky Was '100 Percent Good'During an interview with conservative podcaster Shawn Ryan in August 2024, Trump suggested that Zelensky was by some measure \"involved\" in what he called the 2019 impeachment \"hoax.\" He nonetheless praised Zelensky's response over their communications, telling Ryan the Ukrainian leader's response was \"100 percent good\" and, again, \"very honorable.\"September 27, 2024Trump Touts 'Very Good Relationship'Zelensky and Trump continued their one-on-one conversations in September 2024 when the Ukrainian leader visited Trump Tower in New York City.\"We have a very good relationship. I also have a very good relationship with President Putin and, you know, I think if we win, we're going to get it resolved very quickly,\" Trump said, adding that Zelensky had \"gone through hell.\"However, earlier the same week, Trump said at a campaign event in North Carolina that Zelensky had been making \"nasty little aspersions\" about him. Zelensky had publicly expressed doubts about Trump's plans to end the war.\"Look at the war in Ukraine, and I think it's something we have to have a quick discussion about, because the President of Ukraine is in our country and he's making little nasty aspersions toward your favorite President, me,\" Trump said, adding that Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris had been \"feeding Zelensky money and munitions like no country has ever seen before. Every time he came to our country, he'd walk away with $60 billion.\"At the same North Carolina event, he claimed Zelensky \"refuses to make a deal\" to end the war, previewing some of the commentary in the months ahead.December 8, 2024Zelensky Wants To Make 'A Deal...Stop The Madness'Following a meeting in Paris between Zelensky and French President Emmanuel Macron, Trump claimed the Ukrainian leader was ready to negotiate the war's end.\"Zelenskyy and Ukraine would like to make a deal and stop the madness,\" Trump wrote. \"They have ridiculously lost 400,000 soldiers, and many more civilians. There should be an immediate ceasefire and negotiations should begin.\"Too many lives are being so needlessly wasted, too many families destroyed, and if it keeps going, it can turn into something much bigger, and far worse. I know Vladimir [Putin] well. This is his time to act. China can help. The World is waiting!\"After Trump's election win in November, Zelensky called to congratulate him, although details of the conversation were not repeated or summarized. The conversation drew further attention after it was revealed that billionaire Trump ally Elon Musk had joined the call.January 22, 2025Trump Says Zelensky Is 'No Angel'In his first sit-down interview since returning to the White House, Trump struck out at Zelensky, saying he is \"no angel,\" suggesting he shared the blame for the violence.Trump criticized Zelensky for wanting to fight the war despite massive military deficiencies compared to Russia.\"And Zelensky, I will say this, he wants to settle now, he's had enough. He shouldn't have allowed this to happen, either,\" Trump told Fox News. \"You know, he's no angel. He shouldn't have allowed this war to happen.\"In the same interview, Trump said Putin should not have invaded and that he would impose \"massive tariffs\" on Russia if it \"didn't settle the war soon.\"February 18-19, 2025Trump Calls Zelensky 'A Dictator Without Elections'In a significant escalation, Trump lashed out at Zelensky after the Ukrainian leader said Trump was being influenced by Russian disinformation.The spat began after Trump said during a news conference on February 18 that Ukraine bore responsibility for the war and that it should have elections, despite Ukraine being under martial law. Trump also falsely alleged that Zelensky had a 4 percent approval rating.Zelensky responded by saying he would \"like Trump's team to be more truthful,\" adding that \"President Trump, with great respect for him as a leader of the people (...) unfortunately, lives in this disinformation space.\"Hitting back via Truth Social, Trump wrote on February 19, 2025, that Zelensky was \"A Dictator without Elections\" who \"better move fast or he is not going to have a Country left.\" The post included false claims that the U.S. had spent $350 billion on Ukraine aid and that the war had killed \"millions.\"February 27, 2025Trump Tempers 'Dictator' CommentJust over a week later, during a meeting with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Trump appeared to soften his \"dictator\" criticism. Asked by a reporter if he still believed what he said, Trump responded: \"Did I say that? I can't believe I said that. Next question.\"He added that he wanted to \"work with him\" and that they had a \"very good relationship.\"February 28, 2025Oval Office ArgumentScheduled as part of a deal trading Ukraine's precious earth minerals for U.S. aid, a joint press conference in the Oval Office between Trump, Vance and Zelensky fell to pieces with Trump effectively kicking Zelensky out of the White House in an acrimonious display on live television.In the exchange, Trump began to speak up after Zelensky said the U.S. may \"feel\" the effects of the war with Russia. Trump responded: \"You don't know that. Don't tell us what we're going to feel. We're trying to solve a problem. Don't tell us what we're going to feel.\"Zelensky tried to explain, but Vance and Trump continued, with Trump adding: \"You right now are not in a very good position. You've allowed yourself to be in a very bad position. You don't have the cards right now. With us, you start having the cards.\"You're gambling with lives of millions of people, you're gambling with World War III and what you're doing is very disrespectful to this country.\"Trump went on to complain that Zelensky was refusing the terms of a ceasefire and was not \"acting at all thankful.\"Zelensky departed shortly after, without signing a deal.What Now?Trump attacked Zelensky via social media on Monday, after the Ukrainian leader said a deal to end the war with Russia \"is still very, very far away.\"\"This is the worst statement that could have been made by Zelensky, and America will not put up with it for much longer!\" Trump wrote.\"It is what I was saying, this guy doesn't want there to be Peace as long as he has America's backing, and Europe, in the meeting they had with Zelensky, stated flatly that they cannot do the job without the U.S.—Probably not a great statement to have been made in terms of a show of strength against Russia. What are they thinking?\"​However, despite reports based on administration official comments, Trump said he has not discussed cutting aid to Ukraine.\"I haven't even talked about that right now,\" he replied when asked if he planned to suspend aid.He added that things were moving so fast on Ukraine that, \"I could give you an answer now and go back into my office... and find out it's obsolete.\"Zelensky said he was still \"very much hoping\" for American support. In a post on X, he said: \"We are working together with America and our European partners and very much hope [for] US support on the path to peace. Peace is needed as soon as possible.\"It is very important that we try to make our diplomacy really substantive to end this war the soonest possible. We need real peace, and Ukrainians want it most because the war ruins our cities and towns. We lose our people. We need to stop the war and to guarantee security.\"","summary":"Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky's relationship appears to have fallen apart after years of calls and kind words.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/what-trump-has-said-about-zelensky-since-2022-2039000","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2599535/zelensky-trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-03 22:30:27","author":"Tom Norton","authors":["Tom Norton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.581},{"id":296348018,"title":"Fox News Politics Newsletter: Kamala Harris Protégé to Deliver Trump Response","text":"Welcome to the Fox News Politics newsletter, with the latest updates on the Trump administration, Capitol Hill and more Fox News politics content.

Why isn’t this worthy of an investigation? It shouldn’t be too hard to figure out who orders the coverage and why.” A few months ago Ackman pushed a false story that Vice President Kamala Harris received advance debate questions and was highlighted in an Axios story about “America’s gullibility crisis.”\n\nFox News host Joe Concha also weighed in to support the conspiracy, describing it as “100% accurate.” Concha later scrubbed the post from his X account.\n\nCNN debunked the conspiracy in a post from the network’s communications department.\n\n“CNN provided live coverage of President Trump’s Butler, PA rally in anticipation of news about his pick for Vice President. Any suggestion contrary to that fact is completely false.” \n\nThe Trump rally in Butler was the subject of intense media focus because it was widely expected that he would announce his running mate at the event. Multiple outlets carried it live because it was the only campaign rally scheduled for Trump before the Republican National Convention. It received intense attention precisely because Trump and his team designed events to occur that way.\n\nContrary to the Rogan narrative, CNN has in fact received ample criticism over the last decade for carrying endless hours of Trump rallies on air without fact checking or context. The network’s airwaves have been frequently used by Trump to further his own conspiracy theories, racism, misogyny, and nonsensical babbling. The network has even offered up defenses for bending over backward for Trump.\n\nRogan’s reality-free monologue is symptomatic of the style of media that makes up the world of conservative/MAGA content, consisting frequently of easily debunked conspiracies that can harm the public. It is no coincidence that Rogan endorsed Trump in the final stretch of the campaign after Trump defended him years earlier for using the racist “n-word.”\n\nMusk’s involvement makes perfect sense as well. Under his leadership and often with his explicit blessing, X has become infested with conspiracy theories that are often shared and circulated by the site’s considerable population of racists and antisemites.\n\nCNN is not innocent, but this accusation against the network is false. It is what happens when Musk and Rogan get together, both empowered by their affiliation with Trump to flood the zone with nonsense.","summary":"Conservative podcaster Joe Rogan and Trump financier Elon Musk discussed and promoted an easily disproven conspiracy theory about CNN during their interview released last Friday.\n\n\n\nThe two men, who have an extensive history of furthering conspiracies, discussed the shooting that occurred at Trump’s 2024 campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\n\n\n\nx\n\n\nx\nYouTube Video\n\n\n“You also know that CNN streamed it live, which I do not believe they did for any other rally—and certainly not for a rally that’s in the middle of nowhere in Pennsylvania.

He noted that Trump has paused international funding through the U.S. Agency for International Development but the Soros-founded Open Society Foundations will continue to fund similar projects.\n\n“Although, thanks to God, USAID is canceled, the Open Society Network still operates,” Szánthó told The Daily Signal in an interview at CPAC last month. “So the fight against the woke machine, against this big geopolitical manipulation machine, is not over.”\n\nSzánthó cited research from the Center for Fundamental Rights in Hungary—which organizes CPAC Hungary and is where he serves as president—that found that the Open Society Foundations has spent $1.4 billion in Europe in the past 10 years. He claimed that USAID and Open Society funneled “at least $20 million” to “Hungarian leftist media organizations, [nongovernmental organizations], think tanks, under projects like ‘human rights,’ ‘rule of law,’ ‘democracy,’ ‘climate change.’”\n\nThe Trump administration has halted most foreign aid, but the White House has highlighted how funds directed through USAID and other federal agencies propped up gender ideology, climate alarmism, and “diversity, equity, and inclusion” programs overseas.\n\nUSAID has many ties to the Left’s dark money network and to the activist groups that staffed and advised the Biden administration. My book, “The Woketopus: The Dark Money Cabal Manipulating the Federal Government,” lays out this vast influence campaign, much of which enjoys funding from Soros’ Open Society Foundations.\n\n“Even with USAID canceled, this woke hydra has four or five additional heads,” Szánthó warned. “This whole woke machine is so deep.”\n\nThe Hungarian conservative contrasted Soros’ globalism with patriotism in Hungary and the United States.\n\n“George Soros is a very typical ‘anywhere guy,’” Szánthó explained. He dismissed the idea that Soros, who grew up in Hungary, at all represents the Hungarian people. “There are localists, sovereignists—’somewhere’ guys—and there are ‘anywhere guys’—the globalists.”\n\nHe argued that Soros and his son, Alex Soros (who now runs the Open Society Foundations), are “typical ‘anywhere’ globalists, and although they speak about those ‘democratic values,’ what they really mean is liberal, progressive democratic values: open borders, gender policies, gender propaganda, weakening the family.”\n\n“I wouldn’t say that George Soros would be Hungarian or American,” Szánthó said. “He’s a globalist.”\n\nHe emphasized that the current political dividing line “is not between the Left and the Right or progressives versus conservatives, but it’s between sovereignists and globalists.” He noted that former Vice President Kamala Harris represented the globalist campaign in the U.S., while Trump represented the sovereignist, patriotic side.\n\nSzánthó warned that some of the same bureaucrats and leaders who held positions of power under Soviet influence went on to become the leftist elites now backed up by Soros’ network.\n\n“Leaders, influencers, journalists who already worked 20, 30, 40 years ago—even before the Iron Curtain fell—now they are promoting, you know, ‘democratic values,’ ‘human rights,’ et cetera, but it’s the same people,” he said.\n\n“The very same people” are pushing “the very same content” with “the very same goal: to undermine normality, to undermine common sense, to undermine God, homeland, and family. But now, they found new brands, new slogans.”\n\nSzánthó also emphasized a “revolving door” between European Union bureaucrats and the nonprofits propped up by the Open Society Foundations—one similar to the Woketopus.\n\n“This Open Society network also finances several Europe-wide entities, NGOs [nongovernmental organizations], human rights groups, and their staff—their researchers, their experts. Now they work for a Soros NGO,” he explained. “Previously, they worked for the European Commission. Before that, they worked for the European Court. Before that, they worked for the European Parliament. Now, they are civil activists. But the next year, they will go back to the European deep state.”\n\nSzánthó described Hungary as “the island of freedom or island of difference” in the “liberal/progressive ocean that is Europe.”\n\nHe urged conservatives to “combine forces” across national boundaries—with Trump in the U.S., President Javier Milei in Argentina, and Prime Minister Viktor Orban in Hungary—to launch “a revival of the patriots.”","summary":"OXON HILL, Md.—A Hungarian conservative leader warned that while President Donald Trump has made great progress, the global “woke machine” remains an abiding threat, propped...

'\nOn February 27, Timberlake posted a message on Instagram less than 15 minutes before his show was scheduled to start in Columbus.\n'You guys, I'm heartbroken, I have to cancel the show tonight,' the 10-time Grammy winner wrote, four months after he canceled his October 23 concert at the same venue amid a bout with laryngitis and bronchitis.\nThe Cry Me a River singer added, 'I went into soundcheck battling the flu and now it's gotten the best of me. It kills me to disappoint you and my team who worked so hard to make this show happen.\n'I want to reassure you, you'll be getting refunds for your tickets. I love you all.'\nA number of fans were critical of the musical artist for waiting so late to call off the show, with one saying, 'Canceling [because] of being sick is 100% understandable.. Canceling 10 minutes before the doors were to open is unacceptable.'\nAnother added: 'The show was canceled at 7:30 and the show was supposed to start at 8:00, I’m sorry if you have the flu you would’ve know before 1/2hour before the show starts. There were little kids standing in line that was devastated that you canceled. Shame on you.'\nAnother fan asked, 'Could you have told fans sooner than 12 minutes before the show starts?' \n\nJustin Timberlake Instagram posts a video montage wishing his wife Jessica Biel happy birthday\n\nJustin Timberlake performs on stage during the Forget Tomorrow World Tour at Barclays Center on October 07, 2024 in New York City\n\nMeanwhile, fans took out their ire on his wife when Jessica gushed about her husband's tour.\n'There's truly nothing this man can't do,' the actress gushed in a post to Instagram, alongside a video montage showing clips from the tour set to his song, Pusher Love Girl.\n'It's been so special to watch you, listen to you, and be alongside you for this tour,' she continued. 'One last show tonight, give it all you've got. I am the proudest.'\nThe post came just hours before Timberlake announced he was canceling his final show in Columbus, Ohio, leaving ticket holders fuming.\nIrate fans took to Biel's Instagram to vent about the canceled show.\n'Apparently can't perform in Columbus because he has now cancelled twice... Taylor Swift toured for three years and only cancelled once for a terrorist plot…' one user snarked.\n'He canceled his last show. This post didn't age well. Poor guy has the flu real bad,' wrote another.\nA number of fans were critical of the singer for waiting so late to call off the show, with one saying, 'Canceling [because] of being sick is 100 percent understandable...\n'Canceling 10 minutes before the doors were to open is unacceptable.'\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nJustin Timberlake angers fans by sharing Jessica Biel dancing clip after canceling concert due to flu\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

He ran on lowering prices on everyday goods during his campaign, frequently criticizing former President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris for the high inflation millions of Americans have dealt with due to the COVID-19 pandemic.However, prices remain high, and polls suggest Trump is beginning to feel the heat from voters more than a month into his presidency.What To KnowOn Monday, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta said its estimate of the United States' GDP for the first quarter of 2025 dropped to -2.8 percent, a worrying sign for the economy.A new report from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) found that the manufacturing index dropped from 50.9 in January to 50.3 in February, contributing to the GDP drop, according to the Atlanta Fed.The Atlanta Fed believed the U.S. GDP was on track to grow throughout most of February, with estimates ranging from positive 2 to nearly 4 percent. On February 28, however, its estimate dropped to -1.5 percent before falling again on Monday.The Associated Press pointed to the possibility of tariffs and a decline in consumer spending as the reasons for the earlier drop.Trump said that tariffs with Canada and Mexico would resume on Tuesday after a 30-day pause. Many economists have warned that these tariffs would increase prices on imported goods and housing for Americans.The Atlanta Fed's estimate is not an official forecast but a \"running estimate of real GDP growth based on available economic data for the current measured quarter.\" It also does not capture the impact of COVID-19 and social mobility, the Atlanta Fed notes.It's not the only worrying sign for the economy on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 500 points after Trump's tariff announcement.Kevin Thompson, a finance expert and founder/CEO of 9i Capital Group, told Newsweek on Monday that Trump should be \"very concerned\" about the Atlanta Fed numbers.He noted that while Trump and his supporters may argue he inherited these economic challenges from Biden, \"there will come a point when this rhetoric falls on deaf ears and no longer carries weight.\"But that time is likely not today,\" he said.Thompson said tariffs are a key factor that may be driving this economic uncertainty.\"If businesses don't know what their input costs will be from month to month, they operate cautiously,\" he said. For instance, if tariffs are expected to rise, businesses may stock up on materials today. But if those tariffs are later reversed, they could be left with excess inventory. This creates a cycle of hesitation—a wait-and-see mode—that disrupts normal operations and investment decisions.\"A dropping GDP is viewed as a sign of a recession, though economists have offered various perspectives about whether the U.S. is likely to see a recession this year due to the tariffs.What People Are SayingFormer Trump economic adviser Stephen Moore to The Wall Street Journal: \"The Trump administration needs to keep its eye on what's happening with prices. It should be a top priority. The trend is a little bit troubling.\"Journalist Josh Kraushaar on X, formerly Twitter: \"The Trump neglect of the economy in the early weeks of his administration looking remarkably similar to Biden's handling of inflation in the early months of his presidency.\"Brad Freeman, writer of the Stock Market Nerd newsletter, on X: \"Friendly reminder that when people fear tariffs, they front-load imports. That lowers net exports, which weighs on GDP. That is largely what the tanking Atlanta Fed GDP Now forecasts are related to.What Happens NextThe full impact of the tariffs on U.S. consumers could be felt after they go into effect on Tuesday.","summary":"The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta said on Monday that the U.S. GDP may be on track to drop in Q1.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-gdp-economy-atlanta-fed-2038990","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2599510/trump-gets-economy-red-flag-before-address.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-03 21:11:09","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.169},{"id":296342106,"title":"Democrats Can’t Just Play Dead","text":"If Democrats don’t protect norms and intuitions, no one else will. You can’t count on Senator Ted Cruz to defend free and fair elections, or Speaker Mike Johnson to stand up for LGBTQ+ rights. And it’s unlikely Senator Susan Collins, despite her many concerns, will hold the line. The fact that Trump was able to muscle through controversial Cabinet picks like Kash Patel, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and Pete Hegseth shows how the party will do whatever he wants. While there is no serious resistance in the Republican Party, there is the pathetic hope that if you give Trump what he wants, he’ll spare you a primary challenge. GOP elected officials seem to care more about keeping their seats in Congress regardless of whether the institution loses its constitutional authority.\nMaybe wealthy people can stomach a period of playing dead, but try convincing Americans who will bear the brunt of the economic “hardship” Elon Musk warned about before the election. For them, a “strategic political retreat,” as Carville suggests, looks more like abandonment in a time of need.\nRepublicans go on offense and play to their base whether in power or not, while Democrats seem hostile to their own. Think of the 2024 election cycle when Kamala Harris’s campaign bet big that support from Liz Cheney was going to draw significant numbers of disaffected (non-MAGA) Republicans, even as there were warning signs about diminished support among core Democratic constituencies. In the end, Harris won about 75 million votes, a drop from Joe Biden’s 81 million in 2020 (all while nearly 90 million eligible voters stayed home). As The New York Times noted in December, data suggested “that most voters who turned out in 2020 but stayed home in 2024 voted for Biden in 2020—but about half of them, and maybe even a slight majority, appear to have backed Trump this year.”\nThe base of the Democratic Party is mad. They aren’t going to be satisfied with cringe nicknames and punching left. They don’t want to see leaders lying down, but out there making noise on TV and social media. Sure, there are electeds pushing back, like Senator Chris Murphy; governors Maura Healey, Janet Mills, and JB Pritzker; and representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Jasmine Crockett, and Maxwell Frost. And billionaire Mark Cuban is out there offering support to laid-off government tech workers. But party leadership isn’t meeting the moment and speaking to the deep frustration across the country.\nThis past weekend saw protests at national parks in response to job cuts and layoffs. Between 1,000 and 3,000 people protested in the Vermont ski town that JD Vance was vacationing in, according to protest organizers. Nine people were arrested at a Tesla dealership in New York, while there were protests against Musk at a SpaceX facility in Hawthorne, Texas.\nDemocrats seem more focused on getting their message right and then getting a message out—even as there’s clearly a desire for the party to be more adversarial. According to a CNN poll, “Nearly three quarters (73%) of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents surveyed said the party’s caucus in Congress is doing too little to oppose Trump.”\nIt’s not enough to put out a statement, either, as Democrats need to break through in today’s fractured media ecosystem. Trump floods the zone with everything from social media posts to attention-grabbing moments on camera, such as last week’s fight with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, while Musk posts nonstop on X. Why aren’t Democrats holding daily press conferences to spell out exactly what Trump and DOGE are doing to the federal government? (Andrew Cuomo found success on this front in the early days of COVID.)\nIt’s striking to see who is out there these days. Take Chris Kluwe, a writer, activist, and former NFL punter, who says he was fired from his high school football coaching job after protesting a MAGA slogan on a plaque at a local library. “I think there is an undercurrent of righteous anger running through the country right now because as Americans, we see our elected representatives (from both sides of the aisle) unable to meet the moment, and we expect better from them,” Kluwe texted me. “They are the ones we’ve elected to hold power, and if they are unwilling to use that power to defend our democracy from a would-be tyrant and his petty thugs, then it is incumbent on us as citizens to stand and deliver.”\nWe haven’t even started to fully experience the hardship that Musk has promised, but the public markets can already tell how unpopular this is all going to be. Tesla stock was down 28% for the month of February. Meanwhile, CNN senior data reporter Harry Enten highlighted last month how Musk’s popularity had plunged, with the majority (53%) opposing him. “They don’t want this! The American people don’t want this!” Enten said. “No, no, no! Just 36% of independents support the idea of Elon Musk having a key role in the Trump administration.”\nDemocrats need to flood the zone with facts, with possible solutions to these cuts, and with an honest appraisal of what’s happening right now. Rolling over and playing dead, even if considered as a short-term solution, could be seen as the opposition party giving up—and essentially giving a green light to Republicans to do long-lasting damage.","summary":"The public is frustrated with Trump and Elon’s DOGE-ification of government.

I enjoy being a show off. I enjoy building my body and celebrating the results. \n'That’s not for everyone, and that’s ok - if you don’t like meat just walk on by the butcher’s shop.\n'Last time being on OF didn’t gel with my role on daytime television. But I quit the TV industry 18 months ago and haven’t looked back. \n'I had an incredible 12-year-long career and achieved some extraordinary milestones that I’ll proudly take with me to the grave. \n'I loved it (mostly) while it lasted, and made some wonderful friendships which I’ll cherish, but that river, for me, had run dry. It didn’t set me alight anymore.\n'Since launching @ruffpuffbrownies and seeing how successful an enterprise can be with nurture and care, I’ve learned about business - creativity, marketing, overheads, margins - all sorts of things that were once alien to me. \n'I’m treating my OF career as precisely that - business. It cycles money into the economy, it puts food on my table, it gives some people a little bit of cheeky joy - it’s a service.\n\nJohn got candid with his 297K followers, cherishing the extraordinary milestones he achieved while working in the TV industry for 12 years - but admitted it just 'didn't set him alight anymore'\n\nJohn, who won the third series of the baking show impressing judges Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood in 2012, launched his profile under the name 'Jonny Boy' \n\nHe left fans divided but plenty raced to support him in the comment section including music icon Michelle Visage\n'If it’s not for you, simply pass it by, and know that I’ll always be using this platform for food, humour, and little glimpses into my life.'\nHe finished by reflecting: 'We’ll all be dead, buried and long forgotten one day, so I’m grabbing the bull by the horns and living this one shot at life to the fullest.\n'And if you want to judge, go ahead, I won’t stop you.

It's becoming her signature style for this term.","text":"Melania Trump's recent White House fashion can be described in one word: menswear.The first lady made an appearance at the US Capitol on Monday to support the \"Take It Down Act\" — a bill that would make posting revenge porn a federal crime.While entering the discussion via the Senate Carriage hallway, Melania was photographed wearing a three-piece tan suit, black tie, white button-down top, and matching pumps.The sharp look matches other menswear ensembles she's sported so far during her husband, Donald Trump's second term in office.Melania wore a similar style almost a week earlier, on February 22, at the 2025 National Governors Association dinner hosted at the White House.For the occasion, she chose a black suit jacket, skinny, ankle-length dress pants, and a white tuxedo blouse with a sharp collar. The first lady also sported her signature pointed pumps.The recent masculine shift in Melania's style is significant. Between 2016 and 2020, during her first years in office, the former model more often wore midi dresses, skirt-and-blouse sets, and gowns.In her first White House portrait, she did wear a suit, though her accessories at the time were feminine. She's seen wearing two diamond rings and a sequined neck scarf in the image.This time around, however, Melania leaned more strongly into menswear for her official portrait.A post shared by Melania Trump (@melaniatrump)Her new portrait shows her wearing a satin suit jacket, a white blouse with buttons left undone, a cummerbund, and pleated pants — all while making a power stance against a table.The first lady hasn't yet shared any details about why she's started gravitating toward suits.Still, just like Michelle Obama and Kamala Harris, she seems to have least realized the impact of power dressing.","summary":"When Melania Trump visited the US Capitol Monday to discuss the \"Take It Down Act,\" she wore a tan three-piece suit and matching heels.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/melania-trump-menswear-signature-style-2025-3","image":"https://i.insider.com/67c606a1b1834fe311660111?width=1200&format=jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-03 20:35:31","author":"Amanda Krause","authors":["Amanda Krause"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.122},{"id":296337216,"title":"Jeff Bezos suffers humiliating slip in front of Lauren Sanchez and Katy Perry during post-Oscars party crawl","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nMonday, Mar 3rd 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump warns Zelensky he 'won't be around very long' if he refuses peace deal with Russia\n\nTerrifying moment shoppers leap out of the way as car speeds down the street in Mannheim - seconds before driver mowed down a crowd and killed two \n\nStunned families reveal how their children's autism symptoms were REVERSED by cheap 'life-changer' drug\n\nTruth about why this year's winter flu season has been SO awful - and why next year's could be even worse\n\nWhat's causing the huge rise in autism: From mothers' hormone levels to severe morning sickness, vitamin deficiency and even air pollution, we examine all the theories behind the 800% increase\n\nPete Wicks takes a swipe at his ex Maura Higgins after she kissed Danny Jones at BRIT Awards afterparty\n\nSmiling Meghan Markle prepares for launch of her Netflix cookery show by enjoying lunch with 'auntie' Serena Williams after tennis star visited family home to play board game with Lilibet\n\nI'm the doctor who helped Donal McIntyre lose three stone in just three weeks WITHOUT Ozempic.

Maura Healey sat down with the New York Times’s Lulu Garcia Navarro Saturday to discuss the tough position Democratic governors across the United States find themselves in under a Donald Trump administration.\n\nIn just one month of his presidency, Trump has issued a frenzy of executive orders that cover federal spending, immigration, diversity initiatives, and tariffs. He even went as far as to say “we are the federal law” when responding to Maine Gov. Janet Mills during a conversation about transgender athletes at the National Governors Association meeting on Feb. 21.\n\n“I heard somebody who thinks he’s king,” Healey told the Times of that incident. “He doesn’t believe that Congress makes the law. He believes that he makes the law.”\n\nHere are the biggest takeaways from Healey’s interview:\n\nWhat is the Democratic brand?\n\nIn addition to the Democrats’ presidential pick, former Vice President Kamala Harris, losing the electoral college 312-226, Democrats are in the minority in both the Senate and the House of Representatives. When asked why she thinks Democrats did “so badly” in the election, Healey said the party has a “big brand problem.” \n\n“To me, the Democratic brand should be about delivering for everyday Americans,” Healey said. “We have the chance to do that.”\n\nHealey acknowledged the work the Biden administration was able to do, but said he faltered in his role as a “communicator in chief.” Former President Joe Biden had essentially pledged that he would only serve one term, and Healey said the party has to live with the consequences of his change of heart.\n\n“I’ll say that part of what got the Democratic Party in trouble this last election is the fact that there was a perception that leaders within the Democratic Party were not actually seeing and feeling people’s pain,” Healey said.\n\nBut Democratic leaders signaled that they do have some leverage against Republicans.\n\nWhile Democrats in the House of Representatives could not get three Republicans to join their side against a budget bill, they still have an upcoming spending bill to negotiate that could shut down the government if not passed.\n\nHandling of immigration crackdowns\n\nIn more recent years, Massachusetts has seen an uptick in migrants moving into the state — from Venezuelan migrants being flown in unexpectedly to Martha’s Vineyard to migrant shelters being severely overwhelmed. \n\nHealey said she “inherited” the state’s crisis when she assumed her role in 2023 and blamed the federal government for intentionally rejecting reforms that could provide clearer pathways for migrants and more resources for surveillance.\n\n“It’s been a challenging situation, to say the least,” Healey said. “And my frustration has been, you know, as a state governor, I am inheriting the problems caused by federal inaction.”\n\nBoston Mayor Michelle Wu, along with mayors from Chicago, Denver, and New York City, will speak in front of Congress Wednesday to defend why they do not cooperate with federal agents on immigration enforcement in their so-called “sanctuary cities.”\n\nTrump’s border czar Tom Homan said he will come to Boston himself and “bring hell with him” in enforcing the president’s immigration agenda. Healey said she would be willing to meet with him and “explain a few things to him.”\n\n“The number of crossings at the border were going down during the end of the Biden administration, and so I think they’re scrambling to figure out how they can keep [their crackdown] going,” Healey said, adding that federal efforts would be better focused elsewhere. “We’ve got governors who are dealing with severe floods, severe fires. There’s plenty of places that we need federal resources and help as states.”\n\nDisbanding DEI on the federal level\n\nIn one of his first actions as president, Trump ordered all federal agencies to disband their DEI — diversity, equity, and inclusion — policies. Healey said she was confused as to why there was so much backlash to DEI, which aims to promote more diversity and fairness in public and private sectors.\n\n“Like, what’s wrong with that?” Healey said.\n\nHealey said, as the first woman and openly gay person elected governor of Massachusetts, she got to her current position through laws that gave everyone an equal opportunity.\n\n“I think about all that was made possible for me, as a woman, because there were state and federal laws in place that said we should treat everybody fairly,” Healey said. “I’m not giving up on that.”\n\nShe added that, even though most companies benefit financially from having diversity in their spaces, the looming fear of Trump and billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency hangs over them and influences their compliance.\n\nOpponents argue DEI does the opposite of what it sets out to do — it discriminates against white, male Americans who have historically dominated the work force. Healey said talks of evolving DEI policies can take place, but she does not agree with moves that would mean marginalized groups are “no longer at the table.” \n\nOverturning case precedents\n\nHealey said she is worried about how the administration and the Supreme Court will handle landmark decisions after the overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022.\n\nGarcia Navarro asked Healey if she was worried about the decision in Obergefell v. Hodges — which required all 50 states to recognize same-sex marriage — being reversed.\n\n“I do,” Healey said. “It is up to everyone to speak out and articulate why it is so important to hold on to precedent. I thought we’d done that with Roe. And look what happened there.”\n\nHealey said the general population supports abortion rights and showed that in the 2024 election, with seven out of 10 states with abortion ballots voting to keep protections. \n\nShe also had a “sober view” of the chance that Trump might try to run for a third term in office, or possibly reexamine the term limits set in the 22nd Amendment.\n\n“I was talking to a historian who I called on Presidents’ Day to ask for some guidance, to help me provide a context for this moment that we’re in,” Healey said. “And she said to me: ‘I can’t. We’ve never seen anything like this before in American history.’”\n\nThe attack on transgender people, and transgender student athletes, also concerns Healey. She said the administration turned an “infinitesimal portion of the population” into a “mountain” and made them seem like a large threat.\n\nHealey said Democrats failed to take some actions that they should have, but said she wants to keep serving her constituents in Massachusetts and work with her colleagues.\n\n“It’s upsetting to be here having this conversation with you at this moment,” Healey told Garcia Navarro. “I, too, ask, how the hell did we get here?”","summary":"Healey sat down with Lulu Garcia Navarro to discuss the tough position facing Democratic governors. \n\n\nThe post &#8216;How the hell did we get here?&#8217;: 4 takeaways from Maura Healey&#8217;s deep-dive NYT interview appeared first on Boston.com.","url":"https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2025/03/03/4-takeaways-from-maura-healey-deep-dive-new-york-times-interview/","image":"https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/LHCEWPMAX4R72HFODTB2MYXT5M-6789b873827c1-768x432.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-03 20:13:04","author":"Emilia Wisniewski","authors":["Emilia Wisniewski"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.405},{"id":296323886,"title":"Trump set to take border ‘victory lap’ in ‘big’ speech to Congress where he will ‘tell it like it is’","text":"President Trump will tout his administration’s hardline immigration policies when he addresses a joint session of Congress for the first time as the 47th president, The Post has learned.\n\nTrump, 78, blasted out an all-caps promo for his remarks on Truth Social, telling his followers: “TOMORROW NIGHT WILL BE BIG. I WILL TELL IT LIKE IT IS!”\n\nThe prime-time address will be an “America First victory lap,” one person close to the White House told The Post Monday afternoon, adding that its content would be “heavy” on the gains made against illegal migration across the southern border. \n\nLast month, The Post reported that the number of illegal migrant encounters at the Mexico frontier had dropped to levels not seen in decades following Trump’s swearing-in Jan. 20. \n\nAs of mid-February, an average of 359 illegal migrants per day had been caught across the entire southern border — down more than 90% from February 2024 and putting the US on track to have the lowest number of monthly border crossings in at least 25 years.\n\nTuesday’s speech, while similar in appearance, is not an official State of the Union address since Trump has not been in office for at least a year. \n\nMeanwhile, some Democrats are grappling with whether to attend the president’s remarks in the House chamber at all. \n\nSen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) has vowed to skip the speech completely, predicting on CNN Monday that Trump will both celebrate the work of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and speak positively about Russia, prospects which the Democrat described as “farce.”\n\nSen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) has also said he will be not attending and will instead be hosting a Facebook Live town hall.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers who will attend received guidance from leadership to “bring a guest who has been harmed by the Trump administration’s early actions or will be hurt by the House Republican budget,” Politico reported Monday. \n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who famously tore up a copy of Trump’s 2020 State of the Union speech, advised Democrats not to visibly object to the president’s statements Tuesday night.\n\n“Any demonstration of disagreement, whether it’s visual or whatever, just let him stew in his own juice,” Pelosi told the Washington Post in an interview published last week. “Don’t be any grist for the mill [for Republicans] to say, ‘This was inappropriate.'”\n\nThe California lawmaker also urged Democrats to focus on making gains in the 2026 midterms, rather than challenging Trump directly.\n\nSen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.) will give the Democrat response to Trump’s speech, a sign the party is refocusing on the Midwest after Californian Kamala Harris lost to Trump in November.\n\nSlotkin, who kept her Senate seat in Democratic hands despite Trump winning Michigan, has promised to “speak directly to the American people.”\n\n“The public expects leaders to level with them on what’s actually happening in our country,” she previewed. “From our economic security to our national security, we’ve got to chart a way forward that actually improves people’s lives in the country we all love, and I’m looking forward to laying that out.”","summary":"President Trump will tout his administration&#8217;s hardline immigration policies when he addresses a joint session of Congress for the first time as the 47th president, The Post has learned.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy CHRISTINE RENDON FOR DAILYMAIL.COM \n Published:19:23 GMT, 3 March 2025 |Updated:20:07 GMT, 3 March 2025 \n\nIt Ends With Us star Brandon Sklenar tip-toed around the legal controversy surrounding his former co-star Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni as he weighed in on the drama once again.\nThe awkward subject came up while Sklenar, 34, was being interviewed by The Hollywood Reporter at the Vanity Fair Oscars party, where he was asked how he had been 'supporting' Lively.\nThe scandal officially kicked off in December after Lively, 37, filed a complaint alleging sexual harassment on the set of their film by Baldoni, 41, and the subsequent creation of a smear campaign - both of which he has denied - and has continued to unfold to this day.\nWhile admitting the whole ordeal was 'tough', Sklenar managed to provide a non-answer about the situation as he pivoted towards the film's larger message and the impact it has had on audiences. \n'It's a tough situation,' he began. 'I just hope everyone remembers what the movie is about and why we made it in the first place. It's about love and it's about supporting women in general and helping people through tough times,' he said.\n'And that movie's helped so many people, and I just want people to remember like what it's about and why we made it. And to kind of keep it on that. That kind of core ethos.'\n\nIt Ends With Us star Brandon Sklenar tip-toed around the legal controversy surrounding his former co-star Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni as he weighed in on the drama once again\n\nSklenar played Lively's love interest Atlas in the film \nIt's not the first time Sklenar has found himself navigating the choppy waters of the on-going legal saga.\n\n Ryan Reynolds branded a 'mean girl' over awkward chat with Blake Lively's movie love interest \nSkelnar, who played Lively's love interest in the film, has been asked about the subject numerous times since it broke out.\nWhen the New York Times first broke the complaint in December, Sklenar posted a link to the article on his Instagram Stories with a message supporting Blake. \n'For the love of God, read this,' he wrote, in addition to tagging Lively and adding a red heart emoji next to her name.\nMore recently, the issue came up again for Sklenar during an interview with Gayle King where he took a more neutral stance. \nKing, 70, put Sklenar on the spot on CBS Mornings as she asked: 'Are you Team Blake or Team Justin?'\nSklenar, who was appearing to plug the second season of Yellowstone prequel, 1923, let out an awkward laugh and said: 'I'm Team It Ends With Us.'\nAsked how he was handling the duelling lawsuits between Lively and Baldoni, Sklenar said: 'I just want people to remember why we made the movie in the first place and what it stands for, and just keeping the focus on that.\n\nThe legal drama between Baldoni, pictured, and Lively dates back to December 2024\n\nLively pictured with Sklenar and her husband Ryan Reynolds, who has also been roped into the drama, at the It Ends With Us premiere \n'I have someone very close to me who's gone through what [Lively's character Lily is] going through for a long time and I've been on the front lines helping her navigate that space, so that movie meant a lot to me and it means a lot to her.\n\nEXCLUSIVE Why Taylor Swift could now be 'the smoking gun' in Lively-Baldoni drama: Insider reveals new twist \n'It was one of the reasons that me doing that movie gave her the strength to change her life.\n'It's unfortunate that things get taken away from what the ethos of that thing is and it gets convoluted.'\nLively accused Baldoni of sexual harassment and orchestrating a smear campaign against her in a lawsuit filed in December while Baldoni accused Lively, her husband Ryan Reynolds, 48, and publicist Leslie Sloane of defamation and extortion in a $400 million suit filed in February.\nBaldoni has denied the allegations from Lively, while Lively, Reynolds and Sloane have denied the accusations made by Baldoni.\nFor astute social media users, the legal conflict was not necessarily a massive surprise as neitzens had suspected a feud was brewing between Lively and Baldoni. \n\nLively accused Baldoni of sexual harassment and orchestrating a smear campaign against her in a lawsuit filed in December while Baldoni accused Lively, her husband Ryan Reynolds, 48, and publicist Leslie Sloane of defamation and extortion in a $400 million suit filed last month\nAt the time, Sklenar addressed the rumored tension feud, once again urging viewers not to forget the key message of the film. \n\n Blake Lively's 'playful' temper tantrum on 2016 red carpet goes viral \nIn his lengthy statement to Instagram, Brandon urged fans not to 'vilify' the women in the film and focus on the messages of it. \n'Colleen and the women of this cast stand for hope, perseverance, and for women choosing a better life for themselves,' he wrote.\n'Vilifying the women who put so much of their heart and soul into making this film because they believe so strongly in its message seems counterproductive and detracts from what this film is about. It is, in fact, the opposite of the point.\n'What may or may not have happened behind the scenes does not and hopefully should not detract from what our intentions were in making this film. It's been disheartening to see the amount of negativity being projected online.'\n\nInitially Sklenar expressed support for Lively but his more recent responses have become neutral; pictured June 2024\nThe actor went on to say someone close to him has been struggling with a relationship similar to Lily - played by Lively - in the film, and he feels a 'responsibility' to bring the story to life and 'spread the message further.'\n'Prior to my involvement in this film, she had not heard of the book. It was only then that she read it. She credits Colleen's book and subsequently this film with saving her life,' he continued.\n'There isn't a single person involved in the making of this film that was not aware of the responsibility we had in making this. A responsibility to all the women who have experienced generational trauma - domestic abuse - or struggle with looking in the mirror and loving who they see.'\nHe also called the film a 'harsh reality check for the men who need to get their s**t together and take responsibility for themselves and their actions,' adding that it was 'meant to inspire,' and also 'validate,' 'recognize' and 'instill hope.'\n\nSklenar is also part of the cast of the Yellowstone prequel 1923\n'Ultimately it's meant to spread love and awareness,' Brandon continued in his message.\nIt is not meant to once again, make the woman the \"bad guy,\" let's move beyond that together.\n'All I ask is that before you spread hate on the internet, ask yourself who its helping.\n'Ask yourself if your opinions are based in any fact. Or if you simply want to be a part of something. Let's be a part of something better together. A part of a new story being written for women and all people everywhere.'\nHe then concluded the heartfelt post with: 'Lead with love and please be kind.'\nBlake LivelyJustin Baldoni\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nBlake Lively's co-star melts down when asked painfully awkward Justin Baldoni question\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

He was acquitted of two higher offenses: using a deadly or dangerous weapon to assault a federal employee and interfering with a federally protected activity.\n\n Prosecutors alleged in a probable cause affidavit obtained by PEOPLE that Valleau, who is White, pulled a knife on a female U.S. mail carrier, who is Black, after becoming upset that she delivered campaign mail for former Vice President Kamala Harris on her route in Farmington Hills, Mich., on Sept. 26, 2024.\n\n At the time, Harris, a Democrat, had been campaigning for the presidency in the 2024 election.\n\n Then, Valleau allegedly yelled, “Black b****, suck my d***,” and told the postal worker he did not want that “Black b**** in my mailbox,” seemingly referring to Harris, prosecutors wrote in the affidavit. The postal worker then “used her USPS-issued pepper spray on the man,” who fled on his bike, prosecutors claimed.\n\n Local police who responded to the scene found Valleau lying facedown on a nearby lawn with his bike close by and claimed he appeared to be intoxicated, per the affidavit. Valleau reportedly told investigators, “I didn’t put my hands on that woman. She maced me. I got arrested,” per the affidavit.\n\n Prosecutors said in the affidavit that no knife was recovered from Valleau when he was arrested or when police searched the area. They also alleged Valleau targeted the postal worker because of her race.\n\n “I think that there were mental health and alcohol issues going on with him,” Valleau’s attorney, James Amberg, tells PEOPLE. “This wasn’t a situation where you were dealing with somebody who was a known racist. He was more of somebody who, as I told the jury, existed on the edge of society.”\n\n Amberg adds, “He was getting other people's mail and didn't like that….It had nothing to do with politics.”\n\n Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage? Sign up for PEOPLE's free True Crime newsletter for breaking crime news, ongoing trial coverage and details of intriguing unsolved cases.\n\n Valleau also faces state charges in connection with the incident. He was charged by the Oakland County Prosecuting Attorney’s Office with one count of ethnic intimidation and one count of assault and battery, per a statement shared in September 2024. \n\n PEOPLE has reached out to state prosecutors for comment on the status of the charges against Valleau but did not hear back in time for publication. According to The Detroit News, the case is pending in Oakland County Circuit Court.\n\n According to a Feb. 28 press release from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Michigan, Valleau is scheduled to be sentenced on May 27 and faces a maximum sentence of one year in prison. Amberg tells PEOPLE that his client has already been behind bars for six months as of March 3.","summary":"Russell Valleau, 62, was convicted of assaulting, opposing, impeding, intimidating or interfering with a federal employee, federal court records show","url":"https://people.com/man-accused-racist-abuse-mail-carrier-kamala-harris-sentenced-11689859","image":"https://people.com/thmb/dD2BgCTf-QoIfm9rUJJUDUfXfL8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(777x417:779x419)/Russell-Valleau-mug-shot-030325-tout-94539e26ab5f4513865c26b501c55d60.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-03 20:04:20","author":"Nicole Acosta","authors":["Nicole Acosta"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.674},{"id":296317034,"title":"Kamala Harris’s Pennsylvania lead could increase with Gov Josh Shapiro as running mate, suggests Daily Mail poll","text":"In a presidential election that will be decided by the slimmest of margins, every decision counts.\n\nBut has Kamala Harris made a mistake with her choice of running mate? \n\nA new DailyMail.com/J.L. Partners poll shows that she is tied with Donald Trump in the likely tipping point state of Pennsylvania. \n\nYet she would be ahead if she had added its governor, Josh Shapiro, to her ticket instead of Tim Walz from Minnesota. \n\nWhen likely voters were asked who they would back, 47 percent said Harris/Shapiro, one point more than said they would vote for Donald Trump and J.D. Vance.\n\nBut when it was Walz on the ticket, the rivals were tied 47 points apiece.\n\nThe numbers bear out what Democrats and Republicans alike said at the time: Harris may have missed a trick by passing over the popular governor of a swing state that could decide who wins the election. \n\nDavid Urban, Trump confidant and longtime Pennsylvania strategist said: ‘Josh Shapiro is an incredibly talented, gifted political athlete.\n\n‘And I think it just speaks to Kamala Harris’s poor judgment and the inherent antisemitism and anti-Zionism in the Democratic Party that she didn’t pick such a clear winner.’\n\nShapiro is Jewish and has been governor since 2023.\n\nPolls regularly label him the state’s most popular politician—more popular even than Taylor Swift, who spent her early life in West Reading, Pennsylvania.\n\nHowever, when Harris was making her decision, some progressives highlighted his stance on Israel and his criticism of pro-Palestinian protesters.\n\nHe may not have won a place on the ticket, but Harris made a nod to the importance of his state, which represents 19 electoral college votes, when she unveiled her choice. She introduced Walz, the governor of Minnesota, as her running mate at a boisterous rally in Philadelphia.\n\nRunning mates rarely decide the outcome of the election. \n\nBut James Johnson, co-founder of J.L. Partners, said with such a tight race Harris may have weakened her chances of victory.\n\n‘Walz has not been a disaster by any means—even in the debate he technically lost to J.D. Vance, he didn’t put voters off. \n\n‘But it is hard to deny that picking a hugely popular governor of the most important state might have been the savvier decision. \n\n‘This road is laced with counterfactuals—not least whether Shapiro could have performed as well under the national spotlight. But for now it looks like he would have been a better pick than Tim Walz.’\n\nPolls suggested that Walz came off second best in his debate against Vance.\n\nAnd he has been forced to repeatedly clarify comments on everything from his whereabouts during the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre to his position on the Electoral College.\n\nFor now, the election is on a knife-edge. The latest data from the J.L. Partners/DailyMail.com election model show that Trump has the lead, with a 58 percent chance of victory.\n\nBut that means the race will go down to the wire.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nIn a presidential election that will be decided by the slimmest of&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Kamala Harris&#8217;s Pennsylvania lead could increase with Gov Josh Shapiro as running mate, suggests Daily Mail poll first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/politics/kamala-harriss-pennsylvania-lead-could-increase-with-gov-josh-shapiro-as-running-mate-suggests-daily-mail-poll/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/rewrite-this-title-Kamala-Harris-would-be-in-line-to.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-03 19:46:00","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.144},{"id":296317036,"title":"Elon Musk Unveils Shocking Reason Behind NASA Astronauts Being Stranded in Space by Biden Administration","text":"SpaceX chief executive Elon Musk has revealed the ‘political reasons’ which he says drove the Biden administration to ‘abandon’ two NASA astronauts in space.\n\nDuring a Friday appearance on Joe Rogan’s podcast, the Joe Rogan Experience, Musk said Biden rejected his offer to bring Sunita Williams and Barry Wilmore home early because it would’ve made Donald Trump ‘look good.’\n\nMusk backed Trump during the 2024 campaign and appeared at several rallies MAGA rallies. \n\nThe tech CEO explained to Rogan that the Biden administration did not want to jeopardize Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign and intentionally ‘pushed the return date past the inauguration date.’\n\n‘There’s no way that they’re gonna make anyone who’s supporting Trump look good,’ he said.\n\nMusk’s remarks shocked Rogan. ‘That’s so crazy… It’s just disgusting that they would use that as a political tool,’ he said. \n\nMusk also noted that the Biden administration was suing SpaceX at the time.\n\n‘So people say, like, ‘Oh, Elon’s making it up. The Biden administration wasn’t against SpaceX,’ he said.\n\n‘I’m like, bro, the Department of Justice had a massive lawsuit against SpaceX for not hiring asylum seekers, even though it is illegal for us to hire anyone who is not a permanent resident.’ \n\nThe DOJ filed that lawsuit in August 2023, alleging that SpaceX was ‘discriminating against asylees and refugees in hiring.’ \n\nBut less than two weeks ago, the DOJ dismissed the case, though the motion did not say why. \n\nMusk told Rogan that although US law prohibits hiring discrimination against asylum seekers, it also prohibits SpaceX from hiring non-permanent US residents because rocket companies are technically advanced weapons companies.\n\nInternational Traffic in Arms Regulations require advanced weapons companies to only hire permanent residents, a.k.a. people with citizenship or green cards, Musk said.\n\n‘An asylum seeker is not a permanent resident. So it is both legal and illegal to hire asylum seekers,’ he told Rogan.\n\n‘Why would [the Biden administration] launch such a massive lawsuit against SpaceX? They’re extremely antagonistic.’\n\nThese statements come just weeks after the joint Fox News Interview with Trump, when Musk first alleged that politics influenced NASA’s decision to delay Williams and Wilmore’s return. \n\nWilliams and Wilmore were only supposed to spend eight days on the International Space Station (ISS) when they arrived on June 6.\n\nBut technical issues with their Boeing Starliner spacecraft prompted NASA to significantly delay their flight home, as the faulty spaceship could not guarantee their safe return. \n\nWhen the agency officially announced its decision last August, then-NASA administrator Bill Nelson said: ‘I can tell you unequivocally, from a personal standpoint, that politics has not played any part in this decision. \n\n‘It absolutely has nothing to do with it.’\n\nDailyMail.com has reached out to NASA for comment on Musk’s latest claims.\n\nWilliams and Wilmore weighed in on the matter during a recent interview with Good Morning America. \n\nWhen asked about Musk’s remarks, Wilmore said: ‘Political reasons — I have not heard that. I’m not sure that that could be the case based on what I know.’ \n\nHe also explained that he and Williams do not view themselves as ‘stranded,’ saying: ‘That’s not how we feel.’ \n\nThe Starliner crew is now due back around March 19 or 20, when they will hitch a ride home on the SpaceX Crew-9 return flight. \n\nBy then, they will have spent more than nine months in space.\n\nMusk told Rogan that only a SpaceX spacecraft can bring the astronauts back to Earth.\n\n‘There isn’t anyone else who can do it,’ he said. ‘The SpaceX Dragon spacecraft is the only one that is considered safe enough to bring them back.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nSpaceX chief executive Elon Musk has revealed the &#8216;political reasons&#8217; which he&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Elon Musk Unveils Shocking Reason Behind NASA Astronauts Being Stranded in Space by Biden Administration first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/elon-musk-unveils-shocking-reason-behind-nasa-astronauts-being-stranded-in-space-by-biden-administration/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/rewrite-this-title-Elon-Musk-reveals-disgusting-reason-Biden-Admin.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-03 19:45:01","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.979},{"id":296322106,"title":"New House Democratic PAC ads target vulnerable GOP over Medicaid","text":"Congressional Republicans are moving forward on the budget reconciliation process, which allows them to bypass Senate procedures to quickly codify President Donald Trump‘s agenda. But Democrats are hammering Republicans over several billions of dollars in projected cuts they say will run right through Medicaid and Medicare.\n\n“The ads highlight how House Republicans are threatening health care for nearly 80 million people, and urge Americans to call on their representatives to ‘stand up for us, not billionaires,'” the House Majority Forward PAC said in a release.\n\nThe ads target several vulnerable members in competitive swing districts, including freshman lawmakers such as Reps. Nicholas Begich (R-AK), Rob Bresnahan (R-PA), Ryan Mackenzie (R-PA), Tom Barrett (R-MI), and Gabe Evans (R-CO).\n\nReps. Bryan Steil (R-WI) and Scott Perry (R-PA), two members in safer red districts that Democrats unsuccessfully tried to flip in the 2024 cycle, are also targets of the ads.\n\nA transcript from one of the ads targets Republicans for wanting to threaten healthcare to “cut another big check to billionaires” — a common talking point Democrats have leaned into since the start of the new Congress and Trump’s inauguration, for which billionaires such as Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg had a front-row seat.\n\nOn the other side, Republicans and Trump have brushed off Democrats’ “hysteria” and insisted that the budget resolution “not once” mentions Medicaid in writing. \n\nHowever, a handful of House GOP lawmakers held out on passing the budget resolution last week over concerns that the $880 billion in cuts from the Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees Medicaid, would include the beneficiary program.\n\nProjections for the 2026 midterm elections, in which the House historically flips to the party opposite that in the White House, show that Democrats will be on defense with 39 competitive seats to the GOP’s 29.\n\nAmong the most competitive Democratic seats are 13 districts Trump won in 2024 but a Democrat held onto, such as Reps. Jared Golden (D-ME), Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (D-WA), and Marcy Kaptur (D-OH). Other competitive races include the districts held by Reps. Derek Tran (D-CA) and Laura Gillen (D-NY) — areas won by former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election and flipped from red to blue by the lawmakers.\n\nRepublicans hold a razor-thin majority, with House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) currently able to lose one vote to pass legislation along party lines. With all members sitting and vacancies filled, that number only bumps up to a two-seat majority, meaning that Democrats only need to pick up three seats to secure a majority in the 2026 midterm elections.","summary":"House Democrats&#8216; super PAC launched new ads across 23 competitive districts Monday that target vulnerable Republicans over Medicaid as Democrats accuse the GOP of wanting to gut healthcare for hardworking Americans.

Jasmine Crockett baselessly said with a straight face Sunday that President Donald Trump is “an enemy to the United States.”\n\nCrockett echoed the Democrats’ failed talking points that Trump is a want-to-be dictator who is “occupying the White House” and “aligning” himself with Russian President Vladimir Putin during her MSNBC appearance. She claimed the U.S. is in a “national security crisis” following the president’s verbal blowout with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a Friday meeting in the Oval Office.\n\n“There’s not a middle ground with this president. [Trump] has no intentions of doing right by, number one, the United States … We are in a national security crisis. We have been in a national security crisis ever since, honestly, before he even ran,” Crockett said. “We know that he had our national secrets stored in Mar-a-Lago, people felt like that wasn’t really a big deal, they wanted to compare it to what’s going on with [former President] Joe Biden. We know he was showing this to people that maybe weren’t supposed to see our national security secrets … And so, right now, and not to mention right now, his [Department of Justice] has decided not to prosecute cases that engage in any type of foreign nefariousness when it comes to getting money.”\n\n“So, unfortunately, we have somebody who is occupying the White House and as far as I’m concerned, he is an enemy to the United States. He swore an oath just like the rest of us,” the congresswoman continued. “But right now, you are literally putting us at risk all because of what? Because you want to convince your followers that you should be a dictator too, that you should never leave the White House? Because you don’t believe that elections should take place? I don’t really understand what is going on and I really don’t know what it’s gonna take for people to wake up.”\n\nWhile she made these accusations against the president, Crockett said during a Feb. 21 podcast appearance that she is “rooting” for Canada and Mexico over the U.S. because Trump threatened to impose tariffs in order to force them to take tougher stances on illegal immigration. (RELATED: Rep. Jasmine Crockett’s Spectacular Trainwreck May Come Back To Haunt Americans)\n\nTrump ordered Zelenskyy to leave the White House after the Ukrainian president accused the U.S. of not truly “engaging in diplomacy” during their Oval Office meeting, causing a scheduled signing of a minerals deal and a joint press conference to be canceled. The president and Vice President J.D. Vance told Zelenskyy that he showed disrespect to U.S. leaders and the American people.\n\nThe president stated during the meeting that he is not aligned with either Putin or Zelenskyy, but is interested in bringing an end to the Russia-Ukraine war in order to benefit the U.S. He announced in mid-February that negotiations to end the Russia-Ukraine war were underway following a call with Putin.\n\n“I’m not aligned with Putin, I’m not aligned with anybody, I’m aligned with the United States of America and for the good of the world. I’m aligned with the world and I want to get this thing over with,” Trump said.\n\nTrump said in a post to Truth Social that Zelenskyy “is not ready for peace” because he is using the U.S. to his own “advantage” in its negotiations with Russia. After being kicked out of the White House, Zelenskyy expressed gratitude to Trump and the American people in a Friday statement after Vance called him out over not thanking the administration for helping him negotiate an end to the war.\n\nCrockett referenced special counsel Jack Smith’s former case which alleged that Trump illegally stored classified documents at his home in Mar-a-Lago, which the president vehemently denied. Judge Aileen Cannon, who oversaw the case and was a Trump-appointee, dismissed the indictment in July with the argument that the appointment of a special counsel violated the U.S. Constitution.\n\nDemocrats repeatedly warned during the 2024 election cycle that Trump is a “fascist” who planned on seizing power if he ever won reelection. American voters seemingly did not buy into these talking points given that Trump won all seven swing states and the popular vote against former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nThe party has sided with Zelenskyy over Trump and Vance following the Oval Office incident. Democratic California Sen.

But if you end the illegal alien fraud, then you turn off that magnet and they leave. And they stop coming and the ones that are here, many of them will simply leave.”\n\nMusk called the entire push to bring in illegal immigrants into the United States a “giant voter scam.”\n\nIn the seven swing states, the margin of victory often tends to be around 20,000 votes, he said. “If you put 200,000 illegals in there and they have like an 80 percent likelihood of voting [Democrat], and it’s only a matter of time before they become citizens, then those swing states will not be swing states in the future.”\n\n“And if they are not swing states, we will be a permanent one-party state-country—a permanent deep-blue socialist state.”\n\nMusk said he believes this plan would have succeeded if former Vice President Kamala Harris won the 2024 presidential race. If Democrats had another four years, they may have legalized enough illegal immigrants in swing states to ensure these would no longer swing, he said.\n\n“Then, they‘d win the House, the Senate, and the presidency. They would then make D.C. into a state, maybe Puerto Rico, get four extra senators, pack the Supreme Court. So then, you’ll have the House, judiciary, Senate, and presidency, all blue.”\n\n“Normally, the bureaucracy eats revolutions for breakfast,“ he said. ”This is the first time that they’re not, that the revolution might actually succeed, that we could restore power to the people instead of power to the bureaucracy.”\n\nMusk said DOGE found 20 million dead people marked as alive and eligible when reviewing the Social Security database, with some of them receiving benefits.\n\n“What it looks like is that most of the fraud is not coming from Social Security payments directly, but because they are marked as alive in a Social Security database that they can then get disability, unemployment, fake medical payments, and other things,” he said.\n\nDemocrats have criticized DOGE for making recommendations on pulling back funds for various programs and raised concerns about security risks.\n\nSchumer said that DOGE was preparing to recommend cuts to chemotherapy and imaging services, funds for veterans with disabilities, and money aimed at helping veterans suffering from “toxic exposure and burn pits.”\n\nThe VA recently said it was reversing course after putting some veterans crisis line hires on hold.\n\n“Even if the VA reverses course, canceling these contracts and firing VA staff is still immensely damaging, very damaging,” Schumer said. “There’s the risk that you can’t re-hire workers back in time, because they’ve moved on to other jobs. And by then, the damage is done.”\n\nThe lawmakers said there have been reports that DOGE staff shared sensitive government information through insecure communication channels.\n\n“These incidents—whether due to maliciousness or incompetence—are inexcusable and raise additional questions about DOGE employees’ access to highly sensitive personal and national security information, and what they are doing with it,” the lawmakers wrote.\n\nThe event is set to take place in November or December 2026, when Musk plans to launch SpaceX Starships.\n\n“At first, we’re just going to try to land on Mars and see if we succeed in landing,” he said. “Let’s say we were able to send five ships. Do all five land intact or do we add some craters to Mars? If we add some craters, we’ve got to be a bit more cautious about sending people.”\n\n“We send SpaceX Dragon to the space station all the time,” he said. The company has taken over 50 people to orbit and back. The situation is “a bit of a political football,” Musk added.\n\n“I’m not lengthening my lifespan by explaining this stuff to say the least. I was supposed to go back to D.C. How am I going to survive?” he said. “I actually have to be careful that I don’t push too hard on the corruption stuff because it’s gonna get me killed.\n\n“It’s like if I push too hard on the corruption stuff, people get desperate,” he said.","summary":"Musk said he has to be careful about not going ‘too hard’ on corruption or he could be killed.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/5-takeaways-from-joe-rogans-3-hour-interview-with-elon-musk-5819016","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2025/02/23/id5814872-Elon-Musk-GettyImages-2200919809-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-03 18:45:40","author":"Naveen Athrappully","authors":["Naveen Athrappully"],"language":"en","category":"sports","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.343},{"id":296308814,"title":"Keith Richards' model daughter Alexandra makes the Rolling Stones legend, 81, a grandfather for EIGHTH time as she welcomes son and names the tot in tribute to her famous father","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nMonday, Mar 3rd 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump savages Zelensky after he says deal with Russia is 'very far away'\n\nKylie Jenner and Timothee Chalamet's 'insane' move at the Oscars divides fans\n\nNepo babies rule the red carpet at the exclusive Vanity Fair Oscars bash - so do YOU know who they are?\n\nTruth about why this year's winter flu season has been SO awful - and why next year's could be even worse\n\nWhat's causing the huge rise in autism: From mothers' hormone levels to severe morning sickness, vitamin deficiency and even air pollution, we examine all the theories behind the 800% increase\n\nPope Francis is back on a ventilator after suffering 'two respiratory failures' as Pontiff's health rollercoaster continues\n\nScourge of the YouTubers who prey on victims like Luisa Zissman: So-called 'auditors' harass landowners and security guards to provoke a reaction that they can turn into controversial videos\n\nI'm the doctor who helped Donal McIntyre lose three stone in just three weeks WITHOUT Ozempic.

It radiates intent.\n\nStanding tall in a sharply tailored pantsuit and a pristine white shirt, the new First Lady stares down the camera. Her perfectly manicured fingers rest on the highly polished table of the Yellow Oval Room. The Washington Monument her towering backdrop and a singular message: Melania is back and this time she means business.\n\nYet within days of the White House releasing this official portrait – captured one day after her husband's inauguration – Melania seemed to all but disappear.\n\nShe wasn't at the Super Bowl when Trump became the first sitting president to attend the championship football game on February 9. Instead, it was first daughter Ivanka Trump who boarded Air Force One to New Orleans with the president and stood with him during the game.\n\nMelania has also been missing from high-profile White House events, such as Trump signing his first piece of legislation into law, The Laken Riley Act.\n\nAnd she's been a no show when he's greeted various foreign leaders who've visited recently – including Ukrainian President Zelensky, whose frosty Oval Office head-to-head with Trump and Vice President JD Vance made headlines last week. \n\nHer official FLOTUS Instagram account has just three posts and her new East Wing staff remains small – less than a dozen people.\n\nShe is yet to hire a social secretary, one of the most prominent positions in an administration.\n\nBut now, finally, on Monday afternoon, she is scheduled to hold her first solo event as the newly minted First Lady. She will be on Capitol Hill supporting the 'TAKE IT DOWN' act – aimed at protecting Americans from deepfake and revenge pornography.\n\nIt will mark her latest foray into public duties, and her first since January 24, when she joined President Trump on visits to North Carolina (devastated by Hurricane Helen last September) and Los Angeles (in the aftermath of the wildfires).\n\nAll of which begs the question: could it be that Melania has been quietly positioning herself as a FLOTUS in absentia, much as she was during her husband's first term?\n\nThe jury is still out on that. But the President perhaps gave us a clue about what has been keeping his wife busy when she was by his side on February 22 at the National Governors' Association Dinner at the White House – the last time Melania was seen in public. \n\nThe President told guests that Melania – uber glamorous in a Dolce & Gabbana tuxedo and towering heels – took the lead in preparing for the black-tie dinner in the chandeliered gilt and splendor of the East Room.\n\n'Let me begin by expressing our gratitude to the First Lady of the United States for hosting the dinner,' he said as the room burst into applause.\n\n'She worked very hard on making sure everything was beautiful. She's very good at that... Thank you for doing such a great job, honey. Really great. Really beautiful.'\n\nBut, aside from party planning, what else has Melania been up to in the interim?\n\nInsiders say her priority this past month has been her son Barron.\n\nHe was just 10 years old when his father was elected president first time round. Then, Melania famously spent much of her time living at Trump Tower, her base when in New York, and delayed her move to Washington to allow Barron to finish his school year in the city.\n\nNow 18, Barron is a Freshman at New York University and has a 24/7 Secret Service detail which means he's likely struggling to have a normal college experience.\n\nMelania, who is understood to have spent much of her time in recent weeks back in New York with Barron, has acknowledged that her son is not like other teenagers.\n\n'I don't think it's possible for him to be a normal student. His experience at college — it's very different than any other kid,' she said in December.\n\nHer other pre-occupation has been an Amazon documentary about her life, scheduled for release later this year.\n\nWhen Jeff Bezos was at the Trumps' Palm Beach residence, Mar-a-Lago, in December to celebrate the election victory, Melania took advantage of the opportunity to pitch her documentary idea, according to reports in the Wall Street Journal.\n\nIt must have been one hell of a pitch. Amazon reportedly agreed to pay $40 million to license the film and Melania's cut is an estimated 70 per cent, meaning she's set to benefit to the tune of at least $28 million.\n\nThe film crew has had unfettered access, joining Melania as she packed up Mar-a-Lago for the move to DC and even getting access to the Trumps' residential quarters in the White House. \n\nLexye Aversa, a longtime Mar-a-Lago member and events planner, told the Daily Mail that she saw the crew at the Palm Beach club in the early part of the year, before the Inauguration.\n\n'They were everywhere. We had to walk around the other way because they were filming,' she said, adding that it was 'really cool' to see and that Melania looked 'regal.'\n\nHousehold staff signed waivers and the whole venture apparently left the Secret Service nervous.\n\nMelania's 'disappearance' after those January 24 visits to North Carolina and LA was apparently due in part to continued filming commitments. In fact, the documentary crew had travelled with her on Air Force One, filming the First Lady in the disaster areas.\n\nAnd at the end of the California leg, Melania split off to focus on finishing the documentary instead of accompanying her husband to Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFilming wrapped in early February and, according to insiders, the First Lady will now resume a more normal schedule of official duties.\n\nShe has said she plans to pick up her 'Be Best' campaign – focusing on the social, emotional and physical health of children – that she started in Trump's first term, though details have yet to be released. \n\nInsiders also say Melania has various other projects and events in the works, but nothing is yet ready to be announced. The First Lady is, after all, a woman who plays her cards close to her chest and even more closely controls her image.\n\nDuring that first Trump term, her East Wing staff would pack her schedule on the days she had agreed to one event – adding social-media videos to be filmed and other public-facing tasks – because on those days, her hair and makeup would be done.\n\nAnd when it comes to image, there is of course the thorny Vogue question. \n\nMelania's predecessor Jill Biden graced the cover twice and, as vice-president, Kamala Harris also made the cut.\n\nHillary Clinton and Michelle Obama were both afforded the honour but Republican first ladies, such as Laura Bush, have been regulated to inside features.\n\nIn the first Trump term, Melania was reportedly offered a feature in Vogue but was not guaranteed the cover so is said to have turned it down.\n\nSurely Melania, a former top model and two-times FLOTUS, has now earned the right to the full works?\n\nAmy O'Dell, who wrote 'Anna: The Biography' about longtime Vogue Editor-in-Chief Anna Wintour, thinks it's possible.\n\n'[Anna] does know how to stir the pot,' O'Dell told the Daily Mail. 'And I don't think it's a foregone conclusion that she's not going to feature Melania. I also don't think anybody knows. Anna is unpredictable.'\n\nOther insiders told the Daily Mail that Wintour, who is believed to be no fan of Donald Trump, has let it be known that she will only extend Melania an invitation under very particular circumstances.\n\nAccording to one: 'Something extraordinary would have to happen. If she was going to leave Donald – if there was a hint of divorce – Anna would be first in line for an interview.'\n\nA Vogue spokesperson says 'cover/editorial plans or speculation around them are never discussed'.\n\nIn the meantime, Melania has had to settle for the cover of Hello magazine in glossy black-and-white photos taken at an airport outside New York a few days after the California trip, by a photographer she knows and trusts.\n\nWho needs Vogue seemed to be the message!\n\nAfter Monday's scheduled appearance, we can certainly expect to see more of Melania in the coming days.\n\nShe and her East Wing staff have been preparing for the reopening of public tours of the White House, which resumed last week after closure for the transition process. \n\nPhotographs of the first couple have been hung along the tour route – many of them from the first Trump term.\n\nAnd she'll also be in the House Chamber on Tuesday, March 4, when President Trump delivers an unofficial 'State of the Union' address. She's been working on her guest list for the first lady's box, preparing to fill it with A-list Trump supporters.\n\nWhen it comes to Melania, you can be certain of one thing. When she is present, she makes sure that presence counts.","summary":"Within days of the White House releasing Melania's official portrait - captured one day after her husband's inauguration - she seemed to all but disappear...","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14430867/Melania-Trump-disappearance-secret-service-panic.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/03/17/95569225-0-image-m-24_1741024688452.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/01/25/5743754429639604421/1024x576_MP4_5743754429639604421.mp4","publish_date":"2025-03-03 18:37:30","author":"Editor,Emily Goodin","authors":["Editor","Emily Goodin"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.247},{"id":296308812,"title":"Pete Wicks takes a swipe at his ex Maura Higgins after she kissed Danny Jones at BRIT Awards afterparty","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nMonday, Mar 3rd 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump savages Zelensky after he says deal with Russia is 'very far away'\n\nKylie Jenner and Timothee Chalamet's 'insane' move at the Oscars divides fans\n\nNepo babies rule the red carpet at the exclusive Vanity Fair Oscars bash - so do YOU know who they are?\n\nTruth about why this year's winter flu season has been SO awful - and why next year's could be even worse\n\nWhat's causing the huge rise in autism: From mothers' hormone levels to severe morning sickness, vitamin deficiency and even air pollution, we examine all the theories behind the 800% increase\n\nPope Francis is back on a ventilator after suffering 'two respiratory failures' as Pontiff's health rollercoaster continues\n\nScourge of the YouTubers who prey on victims like Luisa Zissman: So-called 'auditors' harass landowners and security guards to provoke a reaction that they can turn into controversial videos\n\nI'm the doctor who helped Donal McIntyre lose three stone in just three weeks WITHOUT Ozempic.

On Saturday, Maura was seen sharing a 'drunken kiss' with McFly's Danny \nHe added: 'It's very difficult to have small talk with people when that's their reference because I don't know anything about it.'\nSam said: Let's be honest I can't imagine you hanging out with people who say, \"When's the nearest episode of Love Island?\"'\nPete responded: 'No but even when I walk through the office ... just no.'\nMaura starred on the fifth series of the ITV programme back in 2019, while Sam's ex, Zara McDermott, also featured on the show in 2018. \nOn Sunday, Pete reflected on his boozy night at the BRIT Awards and revealed he was hungover when he launched his new KISS FM radio show, The Sunday Roast, with Olivia Attwood.\nPete spoke about the show when he joined Olivia, 33, on Monday's episode of This Morning, revealing they were both worse for wear when they hosted the radio show just hours later. \nHost Cat Deeley quipped: 'You made it through', as Pete confessed: 'We made it through, I think that's the biggest surprise to the bosses and us that we've made it through.'\n'It was touch and go,' Olivia added.\nCat described how the pair were 'very much full of beans' at the start but eventually 'the hangover started to kick in, just a little bit'.\n\nSeemingly making a dig at his ex on his Staying Relevant podcast, Pete savagely said his would 'banish Love Island from the world' when asked by a fan\n\nHis co-star Sam Thompson laughed and replied: 'That's so aggressive' \n\nMaura starred on the fifth series of the ITV programme back in 2019 (pictured)\n\nIn the video reportedly taken just before 3am shows Maura and Danny stood close to each other and leaning in to chat before he appears to peck her quickly (seen leaving the party)\nFitness coach agreed and said, 'We hit the wall about an hour in' before revealing 'There was a point where Liv laid on the floor'.\nOlivia added, 'I would say 4pm was a low point for me, on a personal level.'\n'My monitor was logged out for ten minutes and I hadn't noticed. A producer came around and she was like, \"You haven't got your script up.\" I was just winging it,' she said. \n'We went to the BRITs to try and get gossip to obviously then tell the listeners on the show but then we couldn't really remember much of what happened so that kind of negated that mission.'\nPete did not mention the video that has emerged of his ex Maura and Danny sharing a kiss at the afterparty. \nThe former Love Islander and the McFly star, 38, both attended Universal Music's star-studded bash at 180 Strand. \nFootage shared with The Sun newspaper shows the pair getting cosy at the London venue where they had also shared a table earlier in the night with their fellow I'm A Celeb co-star Oti Mabuse.\nDanny has been married to wife Georgia since 2014 and the pair share six-year-old son Cooper. \nThe video reportedly taken just before 3am shows them stood close to each other in the venue's foyer and leaning in to chat before he appears to peck her quickly.\n\nOn Sunday, Pete reflected on his boozy night at the BRITs and revealed he was hungover when he launched his new KISS FM radio show, The Sunday Roast, with Olivia Attwood \n\nPete spoke about the show when he joined Olivia, 33, on Monday's episode of This Morning, revealing they were both worse for wear when they hosted the radio show just hours later \nThey were then seen leaving the venue as part of a larger group including Danny's bandmate Tom Fletcher.\nMaura then headed home alone in a taxi. \nAn onlooker told the publication of the interaction: 'Danny and Maura seemed to be having a great time. They looked like they had a brief drunken kiss.\n'Danny and Maura seem to have a close friendship after meeting in the jungle. They were talking and laughing for ages.'\nThe pair sat at different tables for the actual ceremony which was held earlier in the night at the 02 Arena.\nBut at the afterparty they did share a table and exclusive MailOnline footage showed them sitting close together, with Maura even resting her head on Danny's shoulder at one point. \nA source added of the night: 'Danny appeared to be giving Maura advice and at one point he put his arm around her shoulder.'\nRepresentatives for Maura and Danny have been contacted by MailOnline for comment. \nMcFlyMaura HigginsGeorgiaDanny Jones\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nPete Wicks takes a swipe at his ex Maura Higgins after she kissed Danny Jones at BRIT Awards afterparty\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 27\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

It radiates intent.\n\nStanding tall in a sharply tailored pantsuit and a pristine white shirt, the new First Lady stares down the camera. Her perfectly manicured fingers rest on the highly polished table of the Yellow Oval Room. The Washington Monument her towering backdrop and a singular message: Melania is back and this time she means business.\n\nYet within days of the White House releasing this official portrait – captured one day after her husband’s inauguration – Melania seemed to all but disappear.\n\nShe wasn’t at the Super Bowl when Trump became the first sitting president to attend the championship football game on February 9. Instead, it was first daughter Ivanka Trump who boarded Air Force One to New Orleans with the president and stood with him during the game.\n\nMelania has also been missing from high-profile White House events, such as Trump signing his first piece of legislation into law, The Laken Riley Act.\n\nAnd she’s been a no show when he’s greeted various foreign leaders who’ve visited recently – including Ukrainian President Zelensky, whose frosty Oval Office head-to-head with Trump and Vice President JD Vance made headlines last week. \n\nHer official FLOTUS Instagram account has just three posts and her new East Wing staff remains small – less than a dozen people.\n\nShe is yet to hire a social secretary, one of the most prominent positions in an administration.\n\nBut now, finally, on Monday afternoon, she is scheduled to hold her first solo event as the newly minted First Lady. She will be on Capitol Hill supporting the ‘TAKE IT DOWN’ act – aimed at protecting Americans from deepfake and revenge pornography.\n\nIt will mark her latest foray into public duties, and her first since January 24, when she joined President Trump on visits to North Carolina (devastated by Hurricane Helen last September) and Los Angeles (in the aftermath of the wildfires).\n\nAll of which begs the question: could it be that Melania has been quietly positioning herself as a FLOTUS in absentia, much as she was during her husband’s first term?\n\nThe jury is still out on that. But the President perhaps gave us a clue about what has been keeping his wife busy when she was by his side on February 22 at the National Governors’ Association Dinner at the White House – the last time Melania was seen in public. \n\nThe President told guests that Melania – uber glamorous in a Dolce & Gabbana tuxedo and towering heels – took the lead in preparing for the black-tie dinner in the chandeliered gilt and splendor of the East Room.\n\n‘Let me begin by expressing our gratitude to the First Lady of the United States for hosting the dinner,’ he said as the room burst into applause.\n\n‘She worked very hard on making sure everything was beautiful. She’s very good at that… Thank you for doing such a great job, honey. Really great. Really beautiful.’\n\nBut, aside from party planning, what else has Melania been up to in the interim?\n\nInsiders say her priority this past month has been her son Barron.\n\nHe was just 10 years old when his father was elected president first time round. Then, Melania famously spent much of her time living at Trump Tower, her base when in New York, and delayed her move to Washington to allow Barron to finish his school year in the city.\n\nNow 18, Barron is a Freshman at New York University and has a 24/7 Secret Service detail which means he’s likely struggling to have a normal college experience.\n\nMelania, who is understood to have spent much of her time in recent weeks back in New York with Barron, has acknowledged that her son is not like other teenagers.\n\n‘I don’t think it’s possible for him to be a normal student. His experience at college — it’s very different than any other kid,’ she said in December.\n\nHer other pre-occupation has been an Amazon documentary about her life, scheduled for release later this year.\n\nWhen Jeff Bezos was at the Trumps’ Palm Beach residence, Mar-a-Lago, in December to celebrate the election victory, Melania took advantage of the opportunity to pitch her documentary idea, according to reports in the Wall Street Journal.\n\nIt must have been one hell of a pitch. Amazon reportedly agreed to pay $40 million to license the film and Melania’s cut is an estimated 70 per cent, meaning she’s set to benefit to the tune of at least $28 million.\n\nThe film crew has had unfettered access, joining Melania as she packed up Mar-a-Lago for the move to DC and even getting access to the Trumps’ residential quarters in the White House. \n\nLexye Aversa, a longtime Mar-a-Lago member and events planner, told the Daily Mail that she saw the crew at the Palm Beach club in the early part of the year, before the Inauguration.\n\n‘They were everywhere. We had to walk around the other way because they were filming,’ she said, adding that it was ‘really cool’ to see and that Melania looked ‘regal.’\n\nHousehold staff signed waivers and the whole venture apparently left the Secret Service nervous.\n\nMelania’s ‘disappearance’ after those January 24 visits to North Carolina and LA was apparently due in part to continued filming commitments. In fact, the documentary crew had travelled with her on Air Force One, filming the First Lady in the disaster areas.\n\nAnd at the end of the California leg, Melania split off to focus on finishing the documentary instead of accompanying her husband to Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFilming wrapped in early February and, according to insiders, the First Lady will now resume a more normal schedule of official duties.\n\nShe has said she plans to pick up her ‘Be Best’ campaign – focusing on the social, emotional and physical health of children – that she started in Trump’s first term, though details have yet to be released. \n\nInsiders also say Melania has various other projects and events in the works, but nothing is yet ready to be announced. The First Lady is, after all, a woman who plays her cards close to her chest and even more closely controls her image.\n\nDuring that first Trump term, her East Wing staff would pack her schedule on the days she had agreed to one event – adding social-media videos to be filmed and other public-facing tasks – because on those days, her hair and makeup would be done.\n\nAnd when it comes to image, there is of course the thorny Vogue question. \n\nMelania’s predecessor Jill Biden graced the cover twice and, as vice-president, Kamala Harris also made the cut.\n\nHillary Clinton and Michelle Obama were both afforded the honour but Republican first ladies, such as Laura Bush, have been regulated to inside features.\n\nIn the first Trump term, Melania was reportedly offered a feature in Vogue but was not guaranteed the cover so is said to have turned it down.\n\nSurely Melania, a former top model and two-times FLOTUS, has now earned the right to the full works?\n\nAmy O’Dell, who wrote ‘Anna: The Biography’ about longtime Vogue Editor-in-Chief Anna Wintour, thinks it’s possible.\n\n‘[Anna] does know how to stir the pot,’ O’Dell told the Daily Mail. ‘And I don’t think it’s a foregone conclusion that she’s not going to feature Melania. I also don’t think anybody knows. Anna is unpredictable.’\n\nOther insiders told the Daily Mail that Wintour, who is believed to be no fan of Donald Trump, has let it be known that she will only extend Melania an invitation under very particular circumstances.\n\nAccording to one: ‘Something extraordinary would have to happen. If she was going to leave Donald – if there was a hint of divorce – Anna would be first in line for an interview.’\n\nA Vogue spokesperson says ‘cover/editorial plans or speculation around them are never discussed’.\n\nIn the meantime, Melania has had to settle for the cover of Hello magazine in glossy black-and-white photos taken at an airport outside New York a few days after the California trip, by a photographer she knows and trusts.\n\nWho needs Vogue seemed to be the message!\n\nAfter Monday’s scheduled appearance, we can certainly expect to see more of Melania in the coming days.\n\nShe and her East Wing staff have been preparing for the reopening of public tours of the White House, which resumed last week after closure for the transition process. \n\nPhotographs of the first couple have been hung along the tour route – many of them from the first Trump term.\n\nAnd she’ll also be in the House Chamber on Tuesday, March 4, when President Trump delivers an unofficial ‘State of the Union’ address. She’s been working on her guest list for the first lady’s box, preparing to fill it with A-list Trump supporters.\n\nWhen it comes to Melania, you can be certain of one thing. When she is present, she makes sure that presence counts.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe image is stark. It radiates intent.

He was acquitted of using a dangerous weapon in the assault.\n\nThe incident happened last October when the postal worker was delivering mail to Valleau’s home in Farmington Hills. \n\nValleau, who was intoxicated, approached the victim’s vehicle and began yelling racist, sexual and derogatory remarks about Harris and the postal worker herself because of the political ads that were in his mail, according to the Oakland County Prosecutor's Office.\n\nValleau told the mail carrier that he did not want that “black b****” in his mailbox and then called her a “black b****,” Fox2Detroit reported. \n\nThat’s when Valleau pulled a knife out and lunged at the postal worker, who pepper sprayed him in the face, police said. Valleau fled the scene and was later arrested in a neighbor's yard.\n\nWhile in custody, he continued his tirade, referring to the postal worker as a “f***ing smelly n*****.” He was warned about his language to which he responded to the police, “Oh, you like n*****s.”\n\nThe attack happened just weeks before the election, which the former Vice President ended up losing to Donald Trump. \n\n“In this highly charged political moment, everyone has a right to their political opinion and vote,” Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald said at the time. \n\n“Whatever our political beliefs, no one should be assaulted or threatened because of their race, or for doing their job. Hate crimes impact all of us, and we will vigorously pursue all such cases.”\n\nValleau was convicted following a three-day jury trial. \n\nThe jury also unanimously found that Valleau intentionally selected the postal worker for his attack because of her actual or perceived race or color, Fox2 reported.\n\n“A letter carrier was simply trying to do her job, and this defendant physically attacked her while using racist and offensive language,” Acting U.S. Attorney Julie Beck said in a statement following the verdict. \n\n“This type of behavior has no place in our community and will not be tolerated.”\n\nValleau is set to be sentenced on May 27. He faces up to 12 months in prison.","summary":"Russell Frank Valleau, 62, faces up to 12 months in prison for the attack","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/crime/kamala-harris-ads-attack-knife-russell-frank-valleau-b2708207.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/30/23/newFile-1.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-03 18:13:04","author":"Andrea Cavallier","authors":["Andrea Cavallier"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.473},{"id":296290364,"title":"Inside the VERY down to earth wedding of multi millionaires Georgia Toffolo and BrewDog's James Watt as they say I do in low-key fishing port Gardenstown which boasts quaint beach and church with sea views","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nMonday, Mar 3rd 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKylie Jenner and Timothee Chalamet's 'insane' move at the Oscars divides fans\n\nTrump savages Zelensky after he says deal with Russia is 'very far away'\n\nInside the VERY down to earth wedding of multi millionaires Georgia Toffolo and BrewDog's James Watt as they say I do in low-key fishing port Gardenstown which boasts quaint beach and church with sea views\n\nTruth about why this year's winter flu season has been SO awful - and why next year's could be even worse\n\nWhat's causing the huge rise in autism: From mothers' hormone levels to severe morning sickness, vitamin deficiency and even air pollution, we examine all the theories behind the 800% increase\n\nZara McDermott cosies up to Emily in Paris heartthrob Lucien Laviscount at the BRIT Awards after split from Sam Thompson\n\nScourge of the YouTubers who prey on victims like Luisa Zissman: So-called 'auditors' harass landowners and security guards to provoke a reaction that they can turn into controversial videos\n\nI'm the doctor who helped Donal McIntyre lose three stone in just three weeks WITHOUT Ozempic.

We really did it our way!'\n\nThe bride almost suffered a fall as she slipped over the bottom of her dress while walking to the same church James' grandparents married in\n'1st March will forever be the best day of my life - the day I became your wife.

Location: North East Scotland \n'To our family and friends who aren't with us, we will celebrate with you soonest!'\nGeorgia looked stunning for her big day, slipping into a cream, fleece off-the-shoulder dress - perfect for keeping her warm in the chilly Scottish weather. \nThe I'm A Celebrity star styled her blonde locks into an elegant up do' and added dainty diamond earrings and a flowing white veil to her bridal look.\nPerhaps not very bridal were the chunky brown boots she donned with the outfit, though this may have been for health and safety reasons amid their photoshoot on the boat.\nMeanwhile, James himself rocked an unconventional wedding outfit, donning a cream beanie hat and a thick cream jumper worn beneath blue fishing overalls.\nThe couple certainly appeared to get in the spirit of things, with Georgia and James pulling different expressions as they got to grips with some lobsters. \nGeorgia's post was greeted with a plethora of delightful comments from her fans and celebrity pals, who were equally shocked and overjoyed at her big news. \nAfter sharing her images to social media, Georgia shared a video to her Instagram stories shortly after walking down the aisle, excitedly remarking: 'We just got married!' \nGeorgia, who was sat in a car next to James - who at this point was clad in a smart, dark suit - said to the camera: 'It was so unchoreographed! We just came out the church and were like 'wait, where do we go now?' So we just sat in the car! \n\n Georgia Toffolo stuns in an off-white gown as she and James Watt pose for snaps in his granny's house before their low-key wedding in Scotland - after couple eloped on a fishing boat \n'We're going to meet everyone now but it's the best day of our lives! I can't believe it!'\nBack in January, James revealed he will in fact marry Made In Chelsea star Georgia this year after asking his followers on social media whether he should 'take the tax-relief hit' or postpone his marriage for three years.\nSpeculation around when James and Georgia, better known as 'Toff', will tie the knot has grown since he hinted at delaying the ceremony and she said her struggle to find a dress was holding them. \nIn December, the business mogul asked his 427,000 LinkedIn followers if he should put off the nuptials for three years as to not miss out on tax relief.\nMarrying Toff before then would make him a 'connected' person' in her raw dog food business, Wild Pack, after he invested in the company this year which would make him ineligible for the EIS tax relief.\nBut James revealed to MailOnline in January they had already set a date in 2025 for their wedding and picked the venue which they are keeping under wraps for now.\nRegarding his LinkedIn post, he said: 'I thought it was so clear to everyone I was joking because of the tone and the laughing face I put. I was poking fun at how silly the tax rules are and everyone thought it was a serious thing.\n'The tax saving was going to be less than £5,000, so it definitely wasn't something I would consider postponing a wedding for 36 months over.' \nSharing an update on the planning process via Instagram last month, Georgia told her 1.8 million fans the wedding would have taken place the month after their engagement if she had found a dress.\n'We are both incredibly impatient people desperate to waltz down the aisle,' she said, adding they will get married 'very quickly' when she does find the perfect gown.\nShe then filmed a clip with her fiancé and asked him: 'If I find the dress of dreams today when can we get married?'\nTo which he replied: 'Let's say next weekend,' as she added: 'We're not even joking though.'\nThe businessman also joked he will be re-wearing the same suit he wore for his first wedding to his former wife Johanna Basford to be 'sustainable'.\nToff previously shared a sneaky glimpse of her wedding dress shopping but wouldn't let her followers see the whole dress.\nRevealing her plans for the food she confessed they will be having 'sausage rolls' and 'James' Granny's rice pudding'.\nThe reality star also confirmed she will be breaking tradition by spending the night before the wedding with her husband to be.\n'I love being with James so the night before we are going to have all the kids round and we are going to sit on the sofa and watch Mamma Mia,' she said.\nWhile the star admitted she considered eloping, she explained they can't completely elope as their families would miss out but will instead embrace a 'light elope'.\nShe said: 'I just want to go and elope! I think there is something so sexy and beautiful and romantic about a couple eloping.\n'It is kind of unfair because you can't share the joy and we do have family to think about, but if I had my way it would just be us and immediate family.\n'I think I need to plan the most unconventional, weird, whacky wedding that everyone looks at and thinks 'Has she gone mental?' because I think that is what we want.'\n\nAfter the BrewDog founder previously insisted that the pair would be tying the knot this year, it appears that the couple were true to their word - though guests only had 48 hours notice\n\nThe newlyweds looked as loved-up as ever, with Georgia stating: '1st March will forever be the best day of my life - the day I became your wife. We eloped!'\n\nGeorgia looked stunning for her big day, slipping into a cream, fleece off-the-shoulder dress - perfect for keeping her warm in the chilly Scottish weather\n\nTaking to Instagram, Georgia shared loved-up snaps of the newlyweds posing on a fishing boat moments after saying 'I Do', captioning her shock post: 'James and I got married today'\n\nJames went on to share further snaps from their unconventional wedding day, including a sweet picture where he held up his new bride\n\nThe pair got engaged in October after the millionaire proposed with an exquisite eight carat triple-diamond studded band estimated to be worth £200,000 during a romantic getaway in Greece\nIn January, Georgia admitted she was gagging to walk down the aisle but can't bare the thought of all the organisation involved for the big day. \nShe told The Mirror: 'I'm just desperate to get married! I don't want to do any of the planning, I haven't planned a thing, I only want to be married, it's the opposite of how I thought I'd feel.\n'I thought I'd be swept up in what I'm going to wear and have hundreds of people there and all of that.' My preference is to elope. I'm struggling to get it over the line.\nBefore adding: 'Our families are so excited for us and want to be involved, it feels a little selfish to elope. So, we'll see.'\nInstagramMade In ChelseaGeorgia Toffolo\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nInside the VERY down to earth wedding of multi millionaires Georgia Toffolo and BrewDog's James Watt as they say I do in low-key fishing port Gardenstown which boasts quaint beach and church with sea views\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 12\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

I'm a fan of the ideas; I'm not always a fan of the execution.\"\n\n\"The 'macro' was a reference to the main factor that drove centrist businessmen toward Mr. Trump in 2024: a belief that both the spending and the regulatory tilt of the Biden Administration were out of control,\" Rattner observes. \"And they resented how Joe Biden kept bashing big companies. This animus was so intense that even the strong economic gains of the past four years couldn’t get most of them to back Kamala Harris.\"\n\nRattner adds, \"While very few businessmen have been publicly praising the president and his actions, in private, many of them voice support for him….

Weeks after emerging as the presidential nominee in the wake of Joe Biden's decision to withdraw from the race, Harris tapped Walz in August as her running mate in August. Walz, who was seen as a more progressive choice for VP, often appeared alongside Harris at rallies. Harris has been floated as a potential candidate for California governor, while Walz is being considered a presidential candidate for 2028.What to KnowDescribing his relationship with Harris as \"professional,\" Walz explained that he and the California Democrat were on opposite sides of the country busy with their own political realities. Walz has since continued to serve as the governor of Minnesota since the Democrats' election loss, while Harris moved back to the Golden State upon leaving the White House last month.\"I'm doing my job, and she's doing her job, and she's out in California, I believe, living, and I'm here in beautiful Minnesota, where the weather's always great,\" Walz said.The governor added that \"there'll be a time and a place\" for the two to speak again and that his family \"misses\" Harris.\"My daughter, especially,\" he said.During the interview, Walz suggested that an earlier exit from Biden wouldn't have changed the outcome of the election.\"Was there somebody else out there?\" he asked. \"I think we keep looking for this charismatic leader that was going to rise and lead us out of this. I don't think it works that way. I think, as a party, we just need to do a better job of connecting.\"What People Are SayingTim Walz, Minnesota governor, told The New Yorker: \"It was clear that [former Vice President Kamala Harris] was the top of the ticket, and my job was there to support her. She inspired me. I think there were a lot of things that America never knew about her. When I found out she was a band kid, I'm, like, Why aren't we running ads on that?\"Kamala Harris, former vice president, said in her 2024 concession speech: \"The outcome of this election is not what we wanted, not what we fought for, not what we voted for. But hear me when I say, hear me when I say, the light of America's promise will always burn bright as long as we never give up and as long as we keep fighting. To my beloved Doug and our family, I love you so very much. To President Biden and Dr. Biden, thank you for your faith and support. To Governor Walz and the Walz family, I know your service to our nation will continue.\"What's NextAlthough Walz ruled out returning to Congress—he told Remnick he'd rather \"eat glass\" than return to the Capitol—the governor would \"certainly consider\" running for president if he thought he could \"offer something.\"\"I've always said this: I didn't prepare my life to be in these jobs, but my life prepared me well,\" Walz said. \"And, if this experience I've had and what we're going through right now prepares me for that, then I would. But I worry about people who have ambition for elected office. I don't think you should have ambition. I think you should have a desire to do it if you're asked to serve. And that's kind of where I'm at.\"","summary":"Describing his friendship with Harris as \"professional,\" Walz said the two have spoke only \"a couple times\" since November.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/tim-walz-reveals-details-post-election-relationship-kamala-harris-2038782","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2599251/tim-walz-kamala-harris.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-03 17:48:39","author":"Katherine Fung","authors":["Katherine Fung"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.085},{"id":296288508,"title":"Dave Portnoy says he rejected invite for ‘trash’ Gavin Newsom podcast","text":"He’s trash like I hate him,” Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy said.\n\n“I just think he’s everything that you think of when you think of, like, a slick politician. That you take a cold shower after you talk with them,” Portnoy added in an interview with Fox Digital.\n\nPortnoy is the mastermind behind popular podcasts, including Call Her Daddy, which got its start on Barstool Sports. However, he said when it came to Newsom’s other podcast, Politickin’, which features former NFL player Marshawn Lynch, he stayed away because of his opinions of the governor.\n\n“They asked me to go on. I said, ‘No,’ because I just don’t like the guy so much,” Portnoy said.\n\nPortnoy has a litany of complaints about Newsom, namely the governor’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. When Newsom announced his latest show, This is Gavin Newsom, Portnoy brought up his gripes again.\n\n“Let’s start with why did you throw a party for yourself at the French Laundry with no masks on in the middle of Covid when California had just about the strictest COVID regs in the country and thousands of small businesses were going outta business because of said policies?” Portnoy commented on Newsom’s post about the podcast. \n\nPortnoy was also largely behind the online circulation of Newsom’s pickup basketball game in China, which the governor took flak for over his performance. Newsom was seen in a video playing with elementary-aged children. As he took the ball in his left hand at the top of the key, a boy stepped closer to block Newsom, but the governor continued his drive and hit the boy, knocking both of them off their feet.\n\nDays before the November election, Portnoy announced he would be voting for President Donald Trump. Portnoy called former Vice President Kamala Harris “the worst presidential candidate in the history of American politics honestly.”\n\nGAVIN NEWSOM BEGINS ‘DETERMINATION OF CLEMENCY’ FOR MENENDEZ BROTHERS\n\nOther podcast guests on This is Gavin Newsom have yet to be announced. Newsom said the episodes in the coming weeks will include “some of the biggest leaders and architects of the MAGA movement.” Since then, he confirmed there are about six guests. While he hasn’t revealed their identities yet, he said, “Look at the lineup at CPAC.”\n\nThis announcement of the new podcast came as Newsom is a year away from reaching his two-term limit after he survived a recall election in 2021.

Some joked that it came from Macron moving Trump’s hand away from his knee during their meeting.\n\n The President appeared unsteady on his feet (Picture: Alesman Brothers LLC)\n\nSimilar worries were raised for former President Joe Biden shortly before he left office – many Republicans took those photos as a chance to attack the former president for his age.\n\nBiden’s bruise also appeared to be covered up by makeup, and many suggested it was also from rumoured IV treatments.\n\nTrump has boasted about his health for years, at one point claiming he was ‘healthier than Obama’, who is 15 years younger than him.\n\nTrump, 78, also claimed his former opponent Kamala Harris had ‘dangerous’ conditions, citing seasonal allergies.\n\n Previous concerns around Trump’s health focused on his hands (Picture: Rex)\n\nMonths ago, a professor said Trump’s ‘slurred speech’ and ‘repeated errors’ showed he had cognitive decline ‘more apparent’ than Biden’s.\n\nPaul Quirk, a political science professor at the University of British Columbia in Canada, told Newsweek how Biden’s grey hair and wrinkles have been the go-to targets for Republican attacks.\n\nYet, he said: ‘From the standpoint of the campaign, Biden’s age should be less of an issue than Trump’s more apparent cognitive decline – displayed in slurred speech and gross, repeated errors in one campaign rally after another.’\n\nGet in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.\n\nFor more stories like this, check our news page.","summary":"Many pointed out his 'wobbly' legs, with others raising worries about potential underlying health issues.","url":"https://metro.co.uk/2025/03/03/whats-going-on-with-trumps-legs-22660645/","image":"https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SEC_242376133-c24f.jpg?quality=90&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-03 17:12:22","author":"Sarah Hooper","authors":["Sarah Hooper"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.186},{"id":296267960,"title":"Elon Musk reveals 'disgusting' reason Biden Admin left NASA astronauts stranded in space","text":"Elon Musk reveals 'disgusting' reason Biden Admin left NASA astronauts stranded in space\n\nREAD MORE: Stranded astronauts' five-word message to Americans on Earth \n\nBy ELLYN LAPOINTE FOR DAILYMAIL.COM\n\nPublished: 16:30 GMT, 3 March 2025 | Updated: 16:56 GMT, 3 March 2025\n\nSpaceX chief executive Elon Musk has revealed the 'political reasons' which he says drove the Biden administration to 'abandon' two NASA astronauts in space.\n\nDuring a Friday appearance on Joe Rogan's podcast, the Joe Rogan Experience, Musk said Biden rejected his offer to bring Sunita Williams and Barry Wilmore home early because it would've made Donald Trump 'look good.'\n\nMusk backed Trump during the 2024 campaign and appeared at several rallies MAGA rallies. \n\nThe tech CEO explained to Rogan that the Biden administration did not want to jeopardize Kamala Harris' presidential campaign and intentionally 'pushed the return date past the inauguration date.'\n\n'There's no way that they're gonna make anyone who's supporting Trump look good,' he said.\n\nMusk's remarks shocked Rogan. 'That's so crazy... It's just disgusting that they would use that as a political tool,' he said. \n\nMusk also noted that the Biden administration was suing SpaceX at the time.\n\n'So people say, like, 'Oh, Elon's making it up. The Biden administration wasn't against SpaceX,' he said.\n\n'I'm like, bro, the Department of Justice had a massive lawsuit against SpaceX for not hiring asylum seekers, even though it is illegal for us to hire anyone who is not a permanent resident.' \n\nDuring a Friday appearance on Joe Rogan's podcast, Elon Musk said the Biden administration rejected his offer to bring Sunita Williams and Barry Wilmore home early because they did not want to 'make anyone who's supporting Trump look good'\n\nThe DOJ filed that lawsuit in August 2023, alleging that SpaceX was 'discriminating against asylees and refugees in hiring.' \n\nBut less than two weeks ago, the DOJ dismissed the case, though the motion did not say why. \n\nMusk told Rogan that although US law prohibits hiring discrimination against asylum seekers, it also prohibits SpaceX from hiring non-permanent US residents because rocket companies are technically advanced weapons companies.\n\nInternational Traffic in Arms Regulations require advanced weapons companies to only hire permanent residents, a.k.a. people with citizenship or green cards, Musk said.\n\n'An asylum seeker is not a permanent resident. So it is both legal and illegal to hire asylum seekers,' he told Rogan.\n\n'Why would [the Biden administration] launch such a massive lawsuit against SpaceX? They're extremely antagonistic.'\n\nThese statements come just weeks after the joint Fox News Interview with Trump, when Musk first alleged that politics influenced NASA's decision to delay Williams and Wilmore's return. \n\nWilliams and Wilmore were only supposed to spend eight days on the International Space Station (ISS) when they arrived on June 6.\n\nBut technical issues with their Boeing Starliner spacecraft prompted NASA to significantly delay their flight home, as the faulty spaceship could not guarantee their safe return. \n\nJoe Rogan was shocked by Musk's claims: 'That's so crazy'\n\nWhen asked about Musk's remarks during a recent Good Morning America interview, NASA astronaut Barry Wilmore said: 'Political reasons — I have not heard that. I'm not sure that that could be the case based on what I know'\n\nWhen the agency officially announced its decision last August, then-NASA administrator Bill Nelson said: 'I can tell you unequivocally, from a personal standpoint, that politics has not played any part in this decision. \n\n'It absolutely has nothing to do with it.'\n\nDailyMail.com has reached out to NASA for comment on Musk's latest claims.\n\nStranded NASA astronauts' 'secret' message to the public, revealed by body language expert JUDI JAMES\n\nWilliams and Wilmore weighed in on the matter during a recent interview with Good Morning America. \n\nWhen asked about Musk's remarks, Wilmore said: 'Political reasons — I have not heard that. I'm not sure that that could be the case based on what I know.' \n\nHe also explained that he and Williams do not view themselves as 'stranded,' saying: 'That's not how we feel.' \n\nThe Starliner crew is now due back around March 19 or 20, when they will hitch a ride home on the SpaceX Crew-9 return flight. \n\nBy then, they will have spent more than nine months in space.\n\nMusk told Rogan that only a SpaceX spacecraft can bring the astronauts back to Earth.\n\n'There isn't anyone else who can do it,' he said. 'The SpaceX Dragon spacecraft is the only one that is considered safe enough to bring them back.'\n\nElon MuskNasaSpaceX\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nElon Musk reveals 'disgusting' reason Biden Admin left NASA astronauts stranded in space\n\nAdd comment","summary":"SpaceX chief executive Elon Musk shocked Joe Rogan when he revealed the 'political reasons' which he says drove the Biden administration to 'abandon' two NASA astronauts in space.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-14455597/joe-rogan-reason-joe-biden-nasa-astronauts-space.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/03/16/95782687-0-image-m-3_1741018667489.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-03 16:56:14","author":"Editor,Ellyn Lapointe","authors":["Editor","Ellyn Lapointe"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-1},{"id":296267988,"title":"Zara McDermott cosies up to Emily in Paris heartthrob Lucien Laviscount at the BRIT Awards after split from Sam Thompson","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nMonday, Mar 3rd 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScourge of the YouTubers who prey on victims like Luisa Zissman: So-called 'auditors' harass landowners and security guards to provoke a reaction that they can turn into controversial videos\n\nTrump 'deliberately escalated' furious White House clash with Zelensky, Germany's chancellor-in-waiting claims\n\nViral video shows moment furious wife catches her half-naked husband 'having sex' with his mistress in the back of his father's work van\n\nI'm the doctor who helped Donal McIntyre lose three stone in just three weeks WITHOUT Ozempic.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy GRANT TUCKER ENTERTAINMENT EDITOR \n Published:16:36 GMT, 3 March 2025 |Updated:16:55 GMT, 3 March 2025 \n\nZara McDermott and Lucien Laviscount set tongues wagging at the Brits after they were spotted getting cosy at the star-studded music bash.\nThe newly single Zara, 28, was seated next to the Emily in Paris heartthrob for the entire ceremony and lapped up the attention she received from him.\nAn insider said: ‘Lucien was making his move. He was chatting her up all night, whispering in her ear and dancing with her.\n‘He seemed really smitten. Zara clearly enjoyed his company as she couldn’t stop smiling and laughing.’\nAwkwardly her ex Sam Thompson was seated just a few tables away from the Love Island beauty, as she dazzled in a stunning white gown with feather detailing which boasted a daring thigh high split.\nHe was joined on the Hitz radio exclusive table with his best pal Pete Wicks, former Love Islander Olivia Attwood, and actress Gemma Atkinson.\n\nZara McDermott and Lucien Laviscount set tongues wagging at the Brits on Saturday night after they were spotted getting cosy at the star-studded music bash\n\nThe newly single Zara, 28, was seated next to the Emily in Paris heartthrob for the entire ceremony and lapped up the attention she received from him\nBut it was only Lucien, 32, which captured Zara’s eye in his striking all white ensemble which perfectly matched Zara’s white dress.\nThe pair were also filmed dancing to Sabrina Carpenter's raunchy pre-watershed performance that saw the lingerie-clad pop star get down on her knees in front of a 'King's Guard'.\nMailOnline has contacted Zara and Lucien's representatives for comment. \nLucien is also recently single after dating pop star Shakira.\nThe 47-year-old Colombian singer fell for the British actor, when they met on the set of the video for her song Punteria and were spotted out for dinner in New York in March last year.\nLucien has been romantically linked to Jesy Nelson, Kelly Osbourne, Brooke Vincent, Leigh-Anne Pinnock and Chelsee Healey over the years.\nHis first high profile relationship was with Kerry Katona in 2011, when he was 19 and she was 31, after they met on Celebrity Big Brother in the UK.\nMailOnline revealed Sam and Zara split in December after five years together with the former Strictly stunner revealing shortly after that she had moved out of their Chelsea home.\n\nThe pair were filmed dancing to Sabrina Carpenter's raunchy pre-watershed performance that saw the lingerie-clad pop star get down on her knees in front of a 'King's Guard' \n\nAwkwardly her ex Sam Thompson, who she split from in December, was seated just a few tables away\n\nAnd ahead of the A-list ceremony the podcast star, and former Love Island bombshell, narrowly missed one another as they posed for photos on the Brits red carpet.\nSam was suited and booted in a black tuxedo which he layered over a stylish navy shirt and posed for solo photos before being joined by his sister Louise Thompson.\nMailOnline can reveal that the I'm A Celebrity winner then very quickly walked the rest of the carpet and didn't stop as he avoided speaking to press.\nHowever his best pal Pete Wicks exclusively told MailOnline, while speaking alongside Olivia Attwood, that 'Sam is struggling tonight'.\nThe former TOWIE star said: 'I'm not without him, he's actually right there, just there. It's hard for him tonight because I have a new work wife and Sam is struggling with that a little bit.'\nOlivia added: 'Sam did grab me earlier and said, \"Liv just so you know I will be with you tonight\" and I said I fully anticipated that you would be. \nPete continued: 'It does feel a little bit weird because I feel like I am', before Olivia interrupted and joked that Pete is 'cheating'. \nHe jokingly added: 'Yes it does, nicely done Liv. Because I've never done that.'\nMinutes after Sam left the carpet Zara made her grand entrance in a stunning white gown which boasted a daring thigh high split. \nFollowing the ceremony, Sam joined Pete and Olivia at the glamorous Universal Music afterparty which was held at 180 The Strand, while it is believe Zara headed straight home.\nIt comes weeks after Sam admitted that Valentine's Day felt like a 'punch to the gut' as he opened up about being single following split from Zara.\nSpeaking on his Staying Relevant podcast on Valentine's Day, the TV personality told co-host Pete that the romantic holiday was the 'longest day of the f***ing year'.\nStrictly star Pete jokingly begged Zara to 'please take Sam back' as the reality star discussed going through 'tough times' and explained how he has adapted his home to allow him to 'forget about the entire world'.\n\nMailOnline revealed Sam and Zara split in December after five years together with the former Strictly stunner revealing shortly after that she has moved out of their Chelsea home; pictured at the BRITs 2024 \nSam said: 'I'm so happy Valentine's Day is over. I'm over the moon, longest day of the f***ing year, never realised how long it is before. You just don't realise until your alone.\n'That day, I did have some time off social media, I played chess with a friend. Marvin [Humes] called me to check in, but you didn't call me Pete.'\nPete replied: 'I don't need to call you you're a 32-year-old man'.\nSam added: 'I would have really liked that, just some sort of reach out.\n'I use to love a Valentine's Day Instagram post, I loved posting it and viewing other peoples, but when your single it hits different, now it is like a punch to the gut.\n'When I wasn't single I was like, I love love but now I'm like, \"no, no, no!\"'\nSam ThompsonPete WicksZara McDermott\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nZara McDermott cosies up to Emily in Paris heartthrob Lucien Laviscount at the BRIT Awards after split from Sam Thompson\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Hollywood is as scared of the world right now as you and I are | Emma Brockes","text":"The Oscars ceremony on Sunday night was long and boring, as it has been for a few years, but this year its shortcomings landed differently. Hollywood’s waning influence, which registered most glaringly last month in the large number of American nominees who showed up in London for the Baftas – not something they were inclined to do in better times – gave the ceremony a sense of low-stakes irrelevance that was frankly a relief from the rest of the news cycle. Still, the question lingers as to why the actors and presenters largely, and mercifully in my view, stayed away from mention of Donald Trump.\n\nAfter the devastating wildfires in Los Angeles in January, the classy thing to have done this year would’ve been to cancel or at least radically downsize the Oscars ceremony, but of course no one involved was going to vote for that. Instead, audiences were treated to a muted spectacle celebrating movies with record-breakingly small box-office returns, including The Brutalist, in which Adrien Brody relived the US postwar construction boom in real time, and Anora, one of the lowest-grossing best pictures of all time, about an exotic dancer who marries a rich Russian. (What could be behind the deep and abiding fascination of straight male directors – and novelists, and podcasters – with the “sex worker community”? That’s right, it’s altruism.)\n\nIn 2017, in the wake of Trump’s first ascent to the presidency, there were many fiery speeches from the Oscars podium, among them Jimmy Kimmel’s opening monologue, which was dominated by Trump content; a defence of immigrants led by the actor Gael García Bernal; and the director Barry Jenkins entreating those in need of help to reach out to the ACLU. This year, by contrast, there was almost nothing: a decent Anora-related joke by the host, Conan O’Brien, about Americans being “excited to see somebody finally stand up to a powerful Russian”. The actor Zoe Saldaña referring pointedly to her immigrant parents. And some criticism of the US government by the Israeli-Palestinian team behind No Other Land, the winner of best documentary.\n\nIf it’s cowardice, it’s not of the ordinary kind. At the 2017 Oscars, there was a running gag about Meryl Streep and Trump premised on the then popular idea that Trump was a big dummy who fluked his way to the White House. That tone doesn’t work now. In fact, given the five-alarm fire of American politics, comic flippancy about Trump has to be calibrated more finely than the broad, bland platform of the Oscars is perhaps designed to accommodate.\n\nThere is also the question of Hollywood’s role in the collapse of the Democratic vote. This is probably delusional thinking, but there may have been a grain of humility – or at least of self-interested awareness – in the decision by wave after wave of Oscar-winning actors on Sunday not to use the podium to make political points. Looking back at the Kamala Harris campaign, which relied heavily on A-list Hollywood support, the conviction that celebrities swing votes or win hearts has never been less popular or assured. Some in the auditorium on Sunday may even still be in recovery from the failure of Time’s Up (remember that?), a dog’s breakfast of a movement in which Hollywood’s leading ladies leveraged their fame for an admirable cause that somehow ended up with Amy Schumer mugging for attention on the Capitol steps.\n\nI feel for public figures in a way: damned if they do, damned if they don’t. After Sunday night, the film industry looks craven and weak – on the other hand, as Ricky Gervais memorably pointed out when he hosted the Golden Globes in 2020: “You’re in no position to lecture the public about anything. Most of you spent less time in school than Greta Thunberg.” No one needs Adrien Brody’s thoughts on anything outside acting – and even that, let’s face it, is a drag.\n\nAnd yet, given the customary willingness of actors and directors to espouse political causes, the silence on Sunday has added to the clanging, baffling sense in the US of: where, exactly, is the dissent? Why aren’t people screaming? (JD Vance and his family did have to be moved to a secret location while on a skiing holiday in Vermont last week because of the numbers who came out to protest.)\n\nPerhaps all the Ozempic in the room had made people light-headed. Perhaps the lack of politics was pregamed. Producers said ahead of the ceremony that the telecast would focus on the ways in which film-making requires “community and collaboration”, which sounds a bit like Jeff Bezos’s commitment to “personal liberties” on the op-ed pages of the Washington Post. Only the actor Daryl Hannah, who managed to throw a V-sign and say: “Slava Ukraine!” to cheers from the crowd, failed to get the memo.\n\nThe takeaway is that, in Hollywood as elsewhere, people are scared, not only because Trump is petty and vindictive but also because the vast uncertainty of the world we’re suddenly in can make judicious silence seem more sensible than speeches. Where that tips into capitulation – and whether Hollywood, like the tech and media industries, will give us our era’s version of Leni Riefenstahl – remains to be seen.\n\n Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnist","summary":"Perhaps the Ozempic was making people light-headed, or the stars felt they should stay silent.

The Biden administration wasn’t against SpaceX,’ he said.\n\n‘I’m like, bro, the Department of Justice had a massive lawsuit against SpaceX for not hiring asylum seekers, even though it is illegal for us to hire anyone who is not a permanent resident.’ \n\nThe DOJ filed that lawsuit in August 2023, alleging that SpaceX was ‘discriminating against asylees and refugees in hiring.’ \n\nBut less than two weeks ago, the DOJ dismissed the case, though the motion did not say why. \n\nMusk told Rogan that although US law prohibits hiring discrimination against asylum seekers, it also prohibits SpaceX from hiring non-permanent US residents because rocket companies are technically advanced weapons companies.\n\nInternational Traffic in Arms Regulations require advanced weapons companies to only hire permanent residents, a.k.a. people with citizenship or green cards, Musk said.\n\n‘An asylum seeker is not a permanent resident. So it is both legal and illegal to hire asylum seekers,’ he told Rogan.\n\n‘Why would [the Biden administration] launch such a massive lawsuit against SpaceX? They’re extremely antagonistic.’\n\nThese statements come just weeks after the joint Fox News Interview with Trump, when Musk first alleged that politics influenced NASA’s decision to delay Williams and Wilmore’s return. \n\nWilliams and Wilmore were only supposed to spend eight days on the International Space Station (ISS) when they arrived on June 6.\n\nBut technical issues with their Boeing Starliner spacecraft prompted NASA to significantly delay their flight home, as the faulty spaceship could not guarantee their safe return. \n\nWhen the agency officially announced its decision last August, then-NASA administrator Bill Nelson said: ‘I can tell you unequivocally, from a personal standpoint, that politics has not played any part in this decision. \n\n‘It absolutely has nothing to do with it.’\n\nDailyMail.com has reached out to NASA for comment on Musk’s latest claims.\n\nWilliams and Wilmore weighed in on the matter during a recent interview with Good Morning America. \n\nWhen asked about Musk’s remarks, Wilmore said: ‘Political reasons — I have not heard that. I’m not sure that that could be the case based on what I know.’ \n\nHe also explained that he and Williams do not view themselves as ‘stranded,’ saying: ‘That’s not how we feel.’ \n\nThe Starliner crew is now due back around March 19 or 20, when they will hitch a ride home on the SpaceX Crew-9 return flight. \n\nBy then, they will have spent more than nine months in space.\n\nMusk told Rogan that only a SpaceX spacecraft can bring the astronauts back to Earth.\n\n‘There isn’t anyone else who can do it,’ he said. ‘The SpaceX Dragon spacecraft is the only one that is considered safe enough to bring them back.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nSpaceX chief executive Elon Musk has revealed the &#8216;political reasons&#8217; which he&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Elon Musk exposes the &#8216;disturbing&#8217; cause of NASA astronauts being abandoned in space by Biden Administration first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/celeb/celeb-news/elon-musk-exposes-the-disturbing-cause-of-nasa-astronauts-being-abandoned-in-space-by-biden-administration/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/03/16/95782687-0-image-m-1_1741018660128.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-03 16:38:59","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.979},{"id":296268492,"title":"He's the Face of a White House Press Corps Under Attack by Trump","text":"Eugene Daniels didn't plan on being the face of the White House press corps in the dawn of a new administration hostile to the news media.\n\nBut because of a clause in the bylaws of the White House Correspondents' Association, an 800-strong group of journalists who report on the president, he was next in line after Kaitlan Collins, the CNN star who was elected 2024-25 president of the association, had to step aside because of a move to New York.\n\nDaniels, 36, a co-author of Politico's Playbook newsletter, has now emerged as a key figure in an escalating fight between the Trump White House and the news media over press access and freedom. And he's balancing his role at the association, which is unpaid volunteer work, with his career, moving this month to a new on-air job at MSNBC.\n\n\"We're all competitors, fierce competitors, and the White House beat is tough, but at the same time, when it's time to stand together, folks actually do that,\" Daniels said of the correspondents' association in an interview. \"It's unfortunate that this is where we are.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has made no secret of its contempt for reporters, but its actions in recent weeks have shocked many news outlets.\n\nPresident Donald Trump first directed his communications team to bar The Associated Press from the press pool, a rotating group of reporters that travels with the president, and from spaces like the Oval Office and Air Force One. That was in retaliation for the AP's continued use of \"Gulf of Mexico\" after Trump's executive order to change the geographical name to Gulf of America. (Dozens of media outlets, including CNN, The New York Times and Fox News, protested the decision, and the AP has filed a First Amendment lawsuit.)\n\nOn Feb. 25, the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, announced that the administration would start deciding which reporters could participate in the press pool and cover the president up close, a role that the White House Correspondents' Association had held for decades.\n\nThe move generated a fresh wave of backlash. Fox News senior White House correspondent Jacqui Heinrich said on the social platform X: \"This move does not give the power back to the people -- it gives power to the White House.\"\n\nDaniels said in a statement at the time that the move \"tears at the independence of a free press in the United States.\" He told members in an email that the White House Correspondents' Association \"will not assist any attempt by this administration or any other in taking over independent press coverage of the White House.\"\n\n\"Every administration up until now, including the Trump administration in term one, has understood that the people who are doing the covering should be making those decisions, not the people being covered,\" Daniels said in an interview.\n\nDaniels began his career in local television in Colorado Springs, Colorado, and joined Politico in 2018 as a video reporter. He rose through the ranks to become a White House correspondent, covering the Biden administration with a focus on Vice President Kamala Harris. He has co-written the influential Playbook newsletter for the past four years.\n\nThis month, he will move to MSNBC as the first correspondent hired since the November announcement that the cable channel will soon be spun out into a new publicly traded company by Comcast, its parent company. Comcast is separating most of its cable networks, including MSNBC, CNBC and USA Network, from its film studio and theme parks.\n\nComcast will also keep the NBC broadcast network, which means MSNBC will no longer have access to NBC News' news-gathering operation. MSNBC's newly named president, Rebecca Kutler, is looking to build up the cable channel's reporting muscle amid a broader shake-up of its lineup, including creating a Washington bureau and hiring domestic and international correspondents.\n\nDaniels, who has been a contributing political analyst to MSNBC since 2021, will become a senior Washington correspondent and co-host of \"The Weekend,\" a panel show on Saturday and Sunday mornings, alongside Jonathan Capehart and other anchors who have yet to be named. His new roles were announced on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" on Monday.\n\nWhile he is moving to a more liberal-leaning outlet, it \"doesn't really matter who is in the Oval Office for me,\" Daniels said. \"My job is to find out information.\"\n\n(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nAs part of the MSNBC lineup changes, Joy Reid's evening news show, \"The ReidOut,\" was canceled. Her show will be replaced with a program led by Symone Sanders Townsend, Michael Steele and Alicia Menendez, the current hosts of \"The Weekend.\" MSNBC host Ayman Mohyeldin is expected to helm an evening edition of \"The Weekend.\"\n\n(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nDaniels, who came out as gay at 27 and has posted about his personal life on social media, has increasingly become the subject of slurs and criticism online as his profile has grown. He said he had deleted the X social platform from his phone as \"self care\" so he could focus on his work. \"For me, that is separate and apart from the work that I do, and other people feel differently, and that's fine,\" he said.\n\nFor now, he's focused on the fight with the White House over access to covering the president, as well as coordinating the response among the White House Correspondents' Association members. It is made up of journalists from a wide range of news outlets, including CNN, the Times and Fox News.\n\nWhile Daniels wouldn't comment on internal discussions at the association about how best to move forward, he said that the broad stance among his members was that the people who covered the White House should be coordinating the logistics of the coverage \"without having to worry about what they wrote that day and if it's going to be a problem for them.\"\n\n\"We're working through making sure that the American people can trust that the pool reports and information that's getting out is unvarnished, that it doesn't come only from the government,\" Daniels said.\n\nDaniels told members of the association last week that this year's annual White House Correspondents' dinner would go ahead as planned. Trump boycotted the dinners throughout his first term. Whether he will attend this year remains to be seen.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.","summary":"Eugene Daniels didn't plan on being the face of the White House press corps in the dawn of a new administration hostile to the news media.","url":"https://www.berkshireeagle.com/nyt/hes-the-face-of-a-white-house-press-corps-under-attack-by-trump/article_0b2b52a5-8833-5046-ac99-d9fdc978e76b.html","image":"https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/berkshireeagle.com/content/tncms/custom/image/2b802cce-8455-11ec-8935-3f9640429655.jpg?resize=600%2C315","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-03 16:30:35","author":"Katie Robertson,North Adams Pride","authors":["Katie Robertson","North Adams Pride"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.174},{"id":296346832,"title":"On PBS, Amanpour Goes Kooky on Climate and Hillary and the Handmaid’s Tale 'Manosphere'","text":"Christiane Amanpour is first and foremost an international affairs correspondent, but for Friday’s PBS edition of Amanpour & Co., she interviewed playwright Joe Murphy and actor Stephen Kunken at the Soho Place theatre in London, where the climate change message play Kyoto, cowritten by Murphy and starring Kunken, is being performed.\n\nAmanpour, who surely considers herself an intellectual, sounded like any other knee-jerk liberal when she again lauded the Hulu series The Handmaid’s Tale (also featuring Kunken), the source for all the red cloak-white bonnet uniform of hundreds of unimaginative feminist protests in the Trump era.\n\nShe called climate change “the existential crisis of our time.” There was praise for environmentalist and 2004 Democratic presidential candidate Sen.

The Jungle or the Handmaid's Tale which you [Kunken] were in might not have been so incredibly difficult to bear had Hillary Clinton not lost when you are playing them and Trump had won with all of his misogyny and all the rest of it. The Jungle, which you [Murphy] did about refugees was also a protest play as to how the world was dealing with the most vulnerable amongst us.\n\nAfter a brief dip into the ostensible subject of Kyoto -- climate change talks -- Amanpour steered the talk back to The Handmaid’s Tale, based on Margaret Atwood’s dystopian feminist novel, and tied it to anti-Trump politics, even harking back to Hillary Clinton’s loss in 2016. (Seriously, liberals, read another book, or in this case, watch another show.\n\nAmanpour: ….Let's just go back to Handmaid's Tale. Because again it’s a real issue, the rights of women.

And thought, and I think when I arrived we all believed that that was, we were making another cautionary tale and we arrived on the ground and it was a whole different reality. It’s hard. It's invigorating to work on those things.\n\nIt’s interesting though, because we went through an entire cycle in the six years we made the show. We had the moment of protest. And then we came back out and we thought, \"Wow, something was achieved here, these voices were heard.\" We saw those red outfits crimson clothes appear outside of Congress, and we were making an effect. And then the show has just wrapped and we’re in a different world again. And I think one of the pieces of solace that we can take in this moment is that time is long.

People with disabilities, proponents of eugenics argued, should be institutionalized.\n\n“[The use of the R-word] is absolutely historically linked to the understanding that ‘r-------’ children are defective children and that we can eliminate defective children for the good of society,” Topher Endress, a reverend in Missouri who holds a doctorate in philosophy, told the Guardian. “I mean, that’s the basis of eugenics.

In general, corporate subsidies and special interest tax breaks are great examples of where government interferes with free markets,” Bezos wrote on Sunday.\n\nBezos also replied to an X user who posted a quote from economist Milton Friedman, who said: “Underlying most arguments against the free market is a lack of belief in freedom itself.”\n\n“Yes they are very much intertwined.
