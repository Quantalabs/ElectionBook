We’ve done more than any administration by far.”\n\nMr Trump, for a total of 10 minutes, held up printed out photos of criminals that his administration, through ICE operations, had taken off the streets\n\n“These are all criminal, illegal aliens. In many cases, they’re murderers, drug lords, drug dealers, they’re the mentally insane. Some of them who are brutal killers are mentally insane.”\n\nMr Trump called out California and Minnesota, saying the States were currently dealing with “professionals” who were being paid to disrupt and agitate ICE operations.\n\nReturning to his “book of accomplishments”, Mr Trump flicked, at random, through the book to call out some of his administration’s work.\n\n“Biden’s stag-flation”, US factory investment, “the best stock market in history”, banning men playing in women’s sport, “record $US18 trillion in US investment”, tariffs, ending “eight un-endable wars”, lowering US drug prices, lowing US gas prices, the One Big Beautiful Bill, which sees no tax on tips and no tax on overtime, cutting Government spending, securing the border and cutting illegal immigration, increasing US exports, cutting illegal aliens off from Government support, and stamping down on drug importations were just some of the points that made Mr Trump’s very long list.\n\nAt one point, the clip holding the papers together snapped of, with Mr Trump joking if it had hurt him, he would not have shown it.\n\nTrump likes the Hells Angels \n\nWhile speaking about illegal alien criminals, including gang members, Mr Trump said those criminals were far worse than any of US origin, calling out “the sweetest people on earth”, the Hells Angels.\n\n“They (criminal illegal aliens) make our criminals look like babies,” Mr Trump said.\n\n“They make our Hells Angels look like the sweetest people on earth.\n\nThe Hells Angels are now considered a nice, high-quality person. I like the Hells Angels, they voted for me. They protected me.”\n\nTrump stopped the pirates\n\nMr Trump spoke at length about Somalians, hitting out at criminals who have committed fraud in the US.\n\nThe President said the US had stopped Somalian pirates, saying the US was treating them like the drug pirates.\n\n“We also also stopped the pirates, they get the same treatment as the drug boats,” the US President said.\n\n“Somalians, you know what they are good at, that’s about the only thing they’re good at, they’re good at pirate ships at sea, big ships.\n\n“You have these massive ships being taken over by Somalian small boats with a big weapon.\n\nMr Trump said shipping and insurance companies didn’t have to worry now.\n\n“All of a sudden, there are no pirates at sea. Have you noticed? We haven’t had a boat taken in a while.”\n\nMr Trump said Somalia wasn’t a country and had no Government.\n\nTrump says he has saved the United States\n\n“If I wasn’t elected President, this country would have been destroyed quickly,” Mr Trump said.\n\nMr Trump said that if former Vice President Kamala Harris or former President Joe Biden had been elected in 2024, the United States would have been destroyed within “a year”.\n\nMr Trump again said that the 2019 US election, which was won by Mr Biden, was “rigged”. Saying more information about this continues to come to light, without providing details about that information.\n\n“We took a country that was dead, and it’s the hottest country in the world right now.\n\nMr Trump touted his strengthening of the US military, saying they have played a pivotal role in taking Venezuela and in securing peace in the “eight un-endable wars” that he has taken responsibility for ending.\n\nMr Trump said people still believed he should have won the Nobel Peace Prize that was instead given to Venezuelan politician Maria Coronia Machado.\n\nWill Trump keep the US in NATO?\n\nMr Trump, when he took questions, finally moved on to topics dominating news headlines around the world.\n\nThe US President said he would not be visiting Paris for an emergency G7 meeting, saying French President Emmanuel Macron wouldn’t “be around for long”.\n\nOn Greenland, Mr Trump remained tight-lipped on plans, however he said the US needed Greenland for national and world security.\n\nAsked how far he was willing to go to acquire Greenland, Mr Trump responded: “You’ll find out”.\n\n“I think something is going to happen that is going to be good for everyone. Nobodys done more for NATO than I have. In every way.\n\n“I think we will work something out. NATO is going to be very happy.\n\nMr Trump said NATO was only as good as the US, and claimed to have made the alliance “so much stronger”.\n\n“Sometimes it’s overrated, sometime it’s not.”\n\nMr Trump left the room and is now expected to travel to Davos, Switzerland where he will meet world leaders, with Greenland and tariffs expected to dominate conversation.","summary":"In a 90+ minute speech celebrating one year back in the White House, US President Donald Trump has lauded his accomplishments, speaking about pirates, the Hells Angels and illegal aliens.","url":"https://thewest.com.au/politics/world-politics/donald-trumps-one-year-speech-hells-angels-somalian-pirates-and-illegal-aliens-what-he-wants-you-to-know-c-21374205","image":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-21374205/a90be72952f4bfea16fbe5aab0df643710acf6a9-16x9-x0y209w4000h2250.jpg?imwidth=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-21 00:18:48","author":"Max Corstorphan","authors":["Max Corstorphan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.108},{"id":394688554,"title":"GOP Voters' Love For Trump Isn't Translating To Midterms Zeal, CNN's Harry Enten Says","text":"On Tuesday, CNN’s chief data analyst Harry Enten underscored the Republican Party’s “motivation problem” heading into November’s midterm elections.\n\nEnten broke down a recent CNN/SSRS poll that found that only 50% of registered Republicans and Republican-leaning voters polled Jan. 9–12 indicated that they’re “extremely motivated” to cast their ballot in 2026.\n\nThe figure marks a double-digit decline — 17 percentage points — from the 67% who answered the same way in October 2024.\n\n“Republicans felt like, ‘Hey, we’re going out for ice cream.’ ...

She doesn’t really want to engage with people in a way that isn’t already orchestrated,” a Democratic consultant in her circle told Politico. \n\n“But her absence has been really notable. And to some people, very offensive.”\n\nWhen she got back to Los Angeles last January, wildfires were still smoldering across the region, just a few miles from Harris’ Brentwood home. \n\nWhile she and her husband Doug Emhoff made a few fire recovery-related appearances, Harris embraced a level of privacy she hadn’t known since before she ran for office as San Francisco district attorney in 2002.\n\nIn February, Harris appeared to lean into a different post-political identity, signing with Creative Artists Agency and setting up a new website for the “Office of Kamala D. Harris,” honoring her vice presidency —moves that struck some Democrats as more Hollywood than grassroots.\n\nSome progressives in LA grew bitter by what they viewed as Harris’ carefully curated detachment from the broader city, according to Politico. \n\nOne Democratic consultant described her limited social footprint as “Kamala’s Los Angeles.”\n\nFanning the flames, Harris and Emhoff recently bought an $8 million home in a ritzy, oceanfront pocket of Malibu that sits in a secluded enclave removed from everyday Angelenos.\n\nThe status of the couple’s four-bedroom, 3,500 square foot home in Brentwood was unclear. According to The Wall Street Journal, Emhoff bought it in 2012 before he met Harris.\n\nCritics also pointed out that taxpayers continue to bear the cost, even has Harris enjoys a low-profile existence and has all but vanished from public life. \n\nAfter Trump pulled Harris’ Secret Service detail, state and local officials scrambled to fill the gap, extending their own security detail using Los Angeles Police Department officers working alongside the California Highway Patrol. \n\nThe shift immediately sparked backlash — including from the city’s powerful police union, which blasted the decision as a misuse of resources.\n\n“Pulling police officers from protecting everyday Angelenos to protect a failed presidential candidate who also happens to be a multi-millionaire, with multiple homes and who can easily afford to pay for her own security, is nuts,” the Los Angeles Police Protective League board of directors told the Los Angeles Times in September.\n\nStill, after a yearlong pause from public life, Harris — who recently took a pass on running for California Gov.

On Greenland, however, Cusack described it as a “once-in-every-25-years dilemma,” and said it “makes sense” for the United States to keep its presence in the country since “Russia and China have an interest there.”\n\n“And he could move to expand the base, but Trump is certainly doubling down after the successful operation in Venezuela that got Maduro.

They don’t want to be talking about this in the fall of 2026, a month or two before the election,” Cusack said.\n\nCusack also said the Greenland topic draws focus away from “bread and butter issues,” saying the Democratic Party didn’t focus on this before the 2024 elections. He said that former Vice President Kamala Harris and the Democrats warned that “democracy will die” if Trump were elected again. Still, Trump campaigned about the Democratic Party’s lack of basic issues while also being “a better candidate” compared to Harris. \n\nWhile Trump’s criticism of “Bidenomics” played a role in his 2024 victory, Cusack said Trump is also being “defensive” on the economy.

Cole Jr.’s defense team, Phillips rejected the FBI’s five-year-long insistence that the devices were “viable” and could have exploded.\n\n“Based on my review of the materials provided, the two suspected pipe bombs in question do not contain an explosive filler capable of causing an explosion,” Phillips wrote.\n\nThe report, filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., late on Friday, is just the latest complication for the U.S. Justice Department and the FBI in the prosecution of Cole, 30, a suburban Virginia man arrested Dec. 4 and charged a day later with two felony explosives counts.\n\nThe defense filed the explosives expert’s report along with a motion to revoke the detention order keeping Cole locked up in the Rappahannock Regional Jail pending trial.\n\n A U.S. Capitol Police bomb robot heads for the alley behind the Capitol Hill Club to render safe a pipe bomb discovered about 12:40 p.m. on Jan. 6, 2021.U.S. Capitol Police CCTV\n\nAt virtually the same time on Jan. 16, U.S. District Judge Amir Ali issued an order rejecting Cole’s emergency petition to reconsider the detention decision made by U.S. Magistrate Judge Matthew Sharbaugh.\n\nPhillips said the chemicals used in the devices were not properly constituted and thus incapable of sparking an explosion.\n\n“These chemicals need to be apportioned into a workable fuel-to-oxidizer ratio: 75% potassium nitrate (also known as saltpeter) 15% charcoal, and 10% sulfur is the most widely cited Black Powder ratio,\" he wrote.\n\n Above: the Capitol Hill pipe bombs before they were processed by a bomb robot. Below: One of the devices reconstructed by the FBI.FBI images\n\n“The photos of the lab samples taken from the powders recovered from the two pipes show mostly large white particles with some flecks of dark material,” Phillips wrote, “which is not visually consistent with Back Powder but is consistent with inadequate mixing in a bowl.”\n\nThe FBI cited purchases of various items the bureau claims Cole made between 2018 and 2022, including sulfur dust and potassium nitrate. No public FBI records cite the purchase of any charcoal. These sourced ingredients can pose a purity problem for use in black powder. Inert ingredients used in the products Cole allegedly purchased tend to blunt their effectiveness as components to make black powder, according to an independent investigator known online as Armitas, who has worked with Blaze News on the pipe bomb investigation.\n\nLike tiny lumps of coal\n\n“Quality black powder, whether commercial or made by a knowledgeable hobbyist in a home setting, is granular and resembles tiny lumps of coal (Thurman, 2010),” Phillips wrote. “This granular black powder, made from 75% potassium nitrate, 15% charcoal, and 10% sulfur, is the result of a multi-step process that involves grinding, milling, pressing, and corning to achieve a high-quality product.”\n\nThe process described by Phillips would be something that requires, at minimum, some level of hobbyist experience.\n\n“In the home environment, this is typically achieved by first purchasing or creating finely ground precursor chemicals. For example, a hobbyist might use a coffee grinder to grind lump charcoal into a fine powder,” Phillips said. “Once the finely ground powders of potassium nitrate, charcoal, and sulfur are acquired, they need to be combined into a homogeneous mixture. A common starting point is to mix the materials using progressively finer mesh screens.”\n\n Vice President-elect Kamala Harris' motorcade drives directly past a pipe bomb as it moves to evacuate Harris from the front of the DNC building on Jan. 6, 2021.U.S. Capitol Police CCTV\n\nThe “early-stage” powders that result from an “incorporation” process “are typically low-strength and require pressing to achieve the performance required for Black Powder firearms, or bomb making,” Phillips wrote.\n\nIn addition to the problems with the fuel, Phillips said the Capitol Hill devices lacked an appropriate fusing system.\n\n“Beyond the lack of a viable explosive filler for the two pipes, neither device has a functional fuzing and firing system capable of igniting a flame-sensitive explosive filler,” he wrote. “Based on my experience and testing, a single 9-volt battery attached to a 1.5-inch square of steel wool will not generate enough heat to ignite Black Powder.”\n\nConstant controversy\n\nThere has been controversy surrounding the devices since their discovery between 12:40 p.m. and 1:05 p.m. on Jan. 6, 2021. A prime example was the deviation from standard protocol by police and U.S. Secret Service agents when the device was found under a bush at the base of a park bench at the DNC building.\n\nThe standard response to discovery of a suspected pipe bomb would be the immediate establishment of a blast perimeter and the evacuation of everyone in nearby buildings. Roads would be closed at the blast perimeter, and no one would be allowed to drive or walk inside.\n\nA Capitol Police counter-surveillance special agent who found the DNC device at 1:05 p.m. walked to a nearby Secret Service sport utility vehicle to notify agents of his discovery. Instead of an urgent reaction, the agents sat in their vehicles for more than two minutes, finishing their lunch.\n\n According to federal law-enforcement standards, the preferred evacuation distance from a pipe bomb is more than 1,200 feet.FBI\n\nEven after emerging from the vehicles parked in the DNC driveway, the agents acted nonchalantly, standing just feet from the device. A uniformed Capitol Police officer walked up to the park bench and took a photograph of the device.\n\nPedestrians were allowed to traverse the sidewalk along South Capitol Street, walking mere feet from the suspected bomb.

Her motorcade pulled out of the underground garage and drove right past the bomb before circling the south end of the building and picking her up at the Ivy Street entrance.\n\nDespite the ostensible threat to Harris’ life, Democrats never claimed the pipe bomb was an attempted assassination. For more than five years since, Harris has neither commented on her close call with disaster, nor explained why she was at the DNC building instead of the Capitol, where as a U.S. senator, her vote was needed to certify the 2020 presidential election.\n\nLike Blaze News?

Lutnick isn’t impressed. “Globalization has failed the West,” Lutnick said bluntly while on a WEF panel Tuesday.\n\nLutnick went on, “I viewed the WEF as not a flagpole in the middle, but in fact, they are the flag. Whichever way the wind blew, so it blew — you should have solar, you should have wind. Why are you going to do solar and wind? Why would Europe agree to be net zero in 2030 when they don't make a battery? They don't make a battery.” \n\nLutnick at Davos: \"Why are you going to do solar and wind? Why would Europe agree to be net zero in 2030 when they don't make a battery? They don't make a battery! So if they go 2030, they are deciding to be subservient to China.\" (Get a load of the looks on the other panelists'… pic.twitter.com/f0uw7ZHcul— Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) January 20, 2026\n\n Read Also: HUD Investigates Minneapolis Race-Based Housing\n\nHe drove home his point: “So if they go [net zero by] 2030, they are deciding to be subservient to China who makes the batteries. Why would you do that? Why would the United States of America, which has oil and natural gas, try to convert to all electricity? China does not have oil and natural gas, electricity and electric cars make perfect sense to them.” As a side note, China is not nearly so dependent on allegedly green energy as the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) would like the world to believe, which is why it has built hundreds of coal plants within the last few years.\n\nThat aside, it is quite true that solar panels and wind turbines rely heavily on abusive and slave labor in Africa and China, and that the CCP dominates the “green” energy manufacturing industry, including through batteries. We’re talking 80%+ of the global solar panel supply chain alone reliant on China.\n\nUnder Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, the United States was preparing to commit energy suicide just like Europe. Indeed, as I noted in May 2024, the Inflation Reduction Act enriched Communist Chinese through “green” tax credits and other measures. Fortunately, the Trump administration is looking to oil, gas, and nuclear power instead.\n\n“Green” energy is toxic for the environment, expensive, inefficient, unprofitable, and unreliable. It is a catastrophe from every perspective. Add to that to the facts that carbon is the building block of life and ecosystems thrive upon warming temperatures and increased carbon levels, and you understand why “net zero” really is suicidal.\n\nGood for Lutnick for bringing some hard truths straight to the heart of the globalist, climate alarmist haven at Davos. The polar ice caps aren’t about to melt into nothing, but globalists’ credibility on climate has certainly melted on the scale of an alpine avalanche.","url":"https://pjmedia.com/catherinesalgado/2026/01/20/davos-uss-lutnick-wrecks-the-net-zero-argument-as-fellow-panelists-gape-n4948531","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2025/63/5dc08753-2713-4717-ae92-826a5c181a29.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-20 22:05:01","author":"Catherine Salgado","authors":["Catherine Salgado"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.042},{"id":394664212,"title":"Vice President JD Vance Is Having Another Baby","text":"Vice President JD Vance and his wife, Usha Vance, announced Tuesday they’re expecting another child this summer.\n\n“We’re very excited to share the news that Usha is pregnant with our fourth child, a boy.

Opening with a lengthy critique of illegal immigration, Trump launched into a monologue covering a wide range of subjects -- from US military action in Venezuela and welfare fraud by Somali immigrants in Minnesota to repeated attacks on his predecessor, Joe Biden. As Trump lurched from subject to subject, the address felt less like a victory lap than a reprise of the campaign that preceded his return to office. This included his false claim -- unprecedented for US presidents -- to have won the election which he lost to Biden in 2020. \"We've done more than any other administration has done, by far, in terms of military, in terms of ending wars, in terms of completing wars,\" said Trump, who returned to office on January 20 last year after defeating Democratic then-vice president Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. \"Nobody's really seen very much like it.\" White House aides circulated a 31-page document listing 365 claimed \"wins\" across immigration, the economy and foreign policy, as reporters packed the briefing room. The president repeated a series of claims long disputed or debunked, including that his 2020 election loss was \"rigged,\" that prescription drug prices had fallen by 600 percent -- a mathematical impossibility -- and that the United States had attracted $18 trillion in inward investment. Trump said high stock markets make Americans feel like they are a \"financial genius,\" but faulted his staff for failing to adequately communicate what he portrayed as major successes in bringing down inflation. On foreign affairs, the Republican signaled an interest in working with Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado on the country's future, following Washington’s January 3 military operation that removed Nicolás Maduro from power. \"We're talking to her,\" Trump said. \"Maybe we can get her involved in some way. I'd love to be able to do that.\" He praised Machado for giving him her Nobel Peace Prize medal, complaining again that the Norwegian committee should have honored him instead. sct-ft/sms","url":"https://today.rtl.lu/news/world/muted-anniversary-trump-marks-first-year-back-with-familiar-grievances-321771620","image":"https://static-prod.rtl.lu/dims4/default/0f469a3/2147483647/strip/false/crop/768x512+0+0/resize/768x512!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Frtl-luxembourg-new-production-web.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fed%2F03%2F6ef018695d4da164685409ebf05b%2F","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-20 21:51:23","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"lu","sentiment":0.148},{"id":394685534,"title":"What is the 25th Amendment? What to know as Dems call for Trump’s removal","text":"Several lawmakers are calling on President Donald Trump's Cabinet and Congress to boot him from office using a never-before-invoked provision of the Constitution.\n\nSome Democrats, including Rep. Yassamin Ansari, D-Arizona, Sen. Ed Markey, D-Massachusetts, and Rep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove, D-California, called for invoking the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office following news that the president sent a text to Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre, saying the United States' plans to take control of Greenland stemmed from his not winning the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nTrump sent the text on Jan. 18, saying in part, \"Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace.\"\n\nThe text has been described as a \"last straw\" for some Trump opponents, who called it an example of the president's ailing faculties.\n\n\"The president of the United States is extremely mentally ill and it’s putting all of our lives at risk,\" Ansari said in a Jan. 19 social media post. \"The 25th Amendment exists for a reason—we need to invoke it immediately.\"\n\n\"Donald Trump is unfit to lead and clearly out of control. Invoke the 25th Amendment,\" Kamlager-Dove said in a post on the same day.\n\n\"Invoke the 25th Amendment,\" Markey said in multiple posts, also on Jan. 19.\n\nCan the 25th Amendment actually be used to remove Trump? How likely is it to happen? Here's what to know.\n\nWhat is the 25th Amendment?\n\nThe 25th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution lays out the rules of succession for the presidential office and those for presidential disability or removal.\n\nThe first two sections of the amendment clarify that the vice president is next in line to take over if the president vacates office due to death, removal or resignation. It also details a means of filling the position of vice president if it became vacant; previously, no new vice president would be appointed until a new president took office. The amendment created a process in which the president nominates a new vice president, who then has to be confirmed by a majority vote in Congress.\n\nThe following sections outline a process for removing the president based on inability or disability. Section 3 allows the president to voluntarily transfer presidential power to the vice president temporarily through a written declaration of saying they are unable to fulfill the presidency's powers and duties. In this case, the vice president does not become the president – they serve as the acting president until the president declares in writing that they are able to take back over. An example of when this may be used is the president planning to undergo a medical procedure.\n\nSection 4 concerns the removal of a president who is unable or unwilling to perform their duties. In the case the president is incapable of serving but does not voluntarily transfer power, they can be declared unable to hold the position by the vice president along with a \"majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide.\"\n\nIf the vice president and Cabinet members issue a written declaration to Congress declaring the president incapable, the vice president immediately becomes the acting president. The president does remain in office in this case, though their authority is temporarily stripped. A 2018 Congressional Research Service report said that in a modern scenario, the majority of current or acting heads of 15 Cabinet positions would need to agree with the vice president to invoke the 25th Amendment.\n\nThe terms \"unable\" and \"inability\" were left intentionally broad, according to the National Constitution Center. Legal scholars have cited impeachment, physical disability or \"political emergencies\" like kidnapping as potential scenarios for the use of Section 4.\n\nCould the 25th Amendment be used against Trump?\n\nTheoretically, the 25th Amendment can be invoked by or against any sitting president. However, the bar for clearing its use is much higher than for other actions like impeachment.\n\nModern interpretations from scholars at institutions like Cornell Law and the Congressional Research Service say the majority, if not all, of the acting Cabinet heads would need to sign on with the vice president to put Section 4 into action.\n\nNeither JD Vance and nor any of the relevant Cabinet members (Secretary of State, Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary of Defense, Attorney General, Secretary of the Interior, Secretary of Agriculture, Secretary of Commerce, Secretary of Labor, Secretary of Health and Human Services, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Secretary of Transportation, Secretary of Energy, Secretary of Education, Secretary of Veterans Affairs and Secretary of Homeland Security) have expressed support for removing Trump or taking punitive action against him.\n\nWhat qualifies as being \"unable\" to serve as the president is a sticking point when speaking about Section 4. Yale Law School, for example, said traits like \"inept,\" \"lazy,\" or \"inattentive\" aren't likely to be a basis alone, according to historic precedents.\n\nEven if Vance and other Cabinet members were to sign a letter and send it to Congress, the president can take power back by declaring to Congress in writing that no inability exists. The vice president and Cabinet, or a special body formed by Congress, would then have to object.\n\nCongress must convene within 48 hours of the 25th Amendment being invoked and have 21 days to make a decision. If the president makes a declaration that they are fit to serve and it is not contested, they resume duties. If the president makes such a declaration but is contested, two-thirds of the House and Senate must agree to allow the vice president to act as president until the president is considered able to serve and can file another declaration after Congress votes on the question, according to the National Constitution Center.\n\nHas the 25th Amendment been used to remove a president before?\n\nThe 25th Amendment was proposed in 1965 and passed in 1967, driven largely by the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Prior to its passage, nine presidents were at least temporarily incapacitated by health issues and six died, according to Britannica, creating questions around interim leadership and transfer of power.\n\nSections 1 and 2 of the amendment were activated during Richard Nixon's presidency in 1973 and 1974, when Vice President Spiro Agnew resigned and was replaced by Gerald Ford, who then replaced Nixon upon his resignation over Watergate. Nelson Rockefeller then filled the empty position of vice president.\n\nSection 3 has been formally invoked twice and informally used a third time. President Ronald Reagan signed a letter mentioning that he was mindful of Section 3 before going under general anesthesia for a colonoscopy on July 12, 1985 and named Vice President George H. W. Bush acting president from 11:28 a.m. until 7:22 pm, when Reagan signed a letter saying he was ready to take back over. Though Reagan originally denied ever formally invoking Section 3, he underwent the steps outlined by it, according to Fordham Law Review, and later wrote in his memoir that he did, in fact, activate Section 3.\n\nPresident George W. Bush handed temporary presidential power over to Vice President Dick Cheney before a colonoscopy on June 29, 2002 and again on July 21, 2007. Both times, Cheney was acting president for roughly two hours.\n\nBiden also invoked Section 3 on Nov. 19, 2021, while undergoing a colonoscopy, making Vice President Kamala Harris the first woman to hold the powers and duties of the president in U.S. history for a little over an hour.\n\nSection 4, the act of involuntary removal that Democratic leaders are likely referencing, has never been invoked.","url":"https://eu.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/2026/01/20/what-is-25th-amendment/88266702007/","image":"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/20/USAT/88271037007-20260120-t-205704-z-668017255-rc-285-jarg-5-m-3-rtrmadp-3-usatrump.JPG?auto=webp&crop=3261,1834,x0,y170&format=pjpg&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-20 21:41:20","author":"The Arizona Republic","authors":["The Arizona Republic"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.295},{"id":394684456,"title":"All About the Vice President’s Kids & Family – Hollywood Life","text":"J.D.

Upon graduating from college, Usha worked as a law clerk for several federal judges. Additionally, she has been a constant presence for her husband during the 2024 presidential race, supporting him throughout speeches, interviews and appearances.\n\nUsha also defended JD’s resurfaced controversial comment about “childless cat ladies” during an interview with Fox. She began her response by noting, “I took a moment to look and actually see what he had said and try to understand what the context was.”\n\n“Because what he was really saying is that it can be really hard to be a parent in this country,” Usha insisted. “And sometimes, our policies are designed in a way that make it even harder.”\n\nThe following is JD’s full comment from his past interview that resurfaced during the 2024 election: “We’re effectively run in this country via the Democrats, via our corporate oligarchs, by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they’ve made. And so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too. And it’s just a basic fact. You look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez]. The entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children. And how does it make any sense that we’ve turned our country over to people who don’t really have a direct stake in it? I just wanted to ask that question and propose that maybe if we want a healthy ruling class in this country, we should invest more, we should vote more. We should support more people who actually have kids, because those are the people who ultimately have a more direct stake in the future of this country.”\n\nHow Many Kids Does JD Vance Have?\n\nJD has three children with his wife, Usha. The spouses have brought their kids to a handful of public events. JD and Usha are currently expecting their fourth child, they announced in January 20, 2026.\n\nWho Are JD Vance’s Children?\n\nUsha and JD welcomed their first child, Ewan, in June 2017. In February 2020, the couple welcomed their second child, Vivek, followed by their third kid, Mirabel, in December 2021.","summary":"Image Credit: Los Angeles Times via Getty Imag J.D.

Russian authorities found the weapon while inspecting it upon arrival in Sochi, the statement said.A website set up in support of Zimmerman describes him as a U.S. Navy veteran, a father of two and an electrician. His family has rejected the charges against him as a “set-up” for a future prisoner exchange.Court records seen by The Associated Press showed that Zimmerman was convicted in October, and the Sochi court verdict was upheld two months later by the Krasnodar regional court.Zimmerman told the court that he traveled to Russia to meet a woman he had previously contacted online and that he had the gun for self defense, unaware of Russian laws, according to the court’ press service statement. He has fully admitted guilt, the statement said.\n\nZimmerman's sister said that, of course, he had a gun on the boat, as there's not exactly a police force on the open seas, and claims he was intercepted in international waters with no intention of going to Russia in the first place.\n\nTo be sure, Zimmerman isn't going to enjoy his time in a Russian prison, and the idea that this was meant to set up a future prisoner exchange isn't out of the realm of possibility. While Trump isn't President Autopen, the truth is that once you encourage that sort of thing, you're going to have to pay hell to put an end to it. There's no guarantee that the Trump administration will even try to make an exchange, much less be successful if it does.\n\nAs for Zimmerman's admission of guilt, though, let's keep in mind that this is Russia. The press there isn't exactly known for honest reporting, especially since they might accidentally fall through a window on the 60th story of some building or something if they don't toe the line.\n\nHe may have admitted guilt, or he may not have. Even if he did, we don't know that he did so honestly, or if he was simply trying to play nice to get a lighter sentence.\n\nRegardless, I somehow doubt the Biden administration – or the Kamala Harris administration that, thankfully, isn't a thing – would even bother to try and free him. Free a basketball player with a long grudge against the United States who continues even after the country worked to get her free? Absolutely. A Navy veteran who had the audacity to own a gun, though?\n\nYeah, I wouldn't see that happening.\n\nHere's hoping the Trump administration feels differently.","url":"https://townhall.com/tipsheet/tomknighton/2026/01/20/american-jailed-by-russia-over-firearm-on-boat-n2669758","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2023/269/ce964d25-51c2-4ef7-bc81-43e819b065af.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-20 21:00:59","author":"Tom Knighton","authors":["Tom Knighton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.465},{"id":394675306,"title":"Gavin Newsom’s Davos Tantrum: An Embarrassing Ramble About Trump, Europe, and Greenland","text":"California Governor Gavin Newsom, a likely 2028 Democratic presidential contender, delivered a Kamala Harris–worthy response at a Davos summit on Tuesday when European reporters asked if he had any advice for those concerned about President Trump trying to muscle his way into control of Greenland.\n\n\"Do you have a message for Europeans who are concerned about messages from the White House around Greenland this week?\" a reporter asked.\n\n\"Yeah,\" Newsom replied. \"Time to buck up.

Gov. Gretchen Whitmer disagrees. \n\n“I think America is ready for a woman president,” Whitmer said, speaking during a sit-down interview at the Detroit Auto Show with journalist Steve Inskeep for National Public Radio. \n\n“I do think that there’s an appetite,” she said moments later. “I just, for whatever reason, we have not had a woman president yet. I think we will at some point in the near future.” \n\nWhitmer, now in her eighth year in office, is term-limited in 2026. She has not announced future plans to run for office, but the former vice-presidential contender has also has long faced speculation about mounting her own run for president. \n\nWhitmer now serves as vice chair of the Democratic Governors Association (DGA), meaning she’s tasked with helping elect and re-elect Democratic governors across the country. \n\nDuring her nearly 30-minute interview with NPR last week, she spoke about the impact of tariffs on Michigan and called action by the Trump administration to investigate Sen. Elissa Slotkin, D-Holly, over a video on American troops refusing illegal orders an “abuse of power.” \n\nWhitmer also responded to a comment made by Obama on her podcast in November of last year, when she said the country is not ready for a woman president and has “a lot of growing up to do.”\n\n“As we saw in this past election, sadly, we ain’t ready,” Obama said. “That’s why I’m like, don’t even look at me about running, because you all are lying. You’re not ready for a woman. You are not.”\n\nObama referenced the 2024 presidential election, when Democrat Kamala Harris lost to President Donald Trump, as proof. \n\nBut Whitmer said she didn’t think the election could be whittled down to just one characteristic or event. \n\n“I don’t think it was just gender,” she said of Harris’ Nov. 5 loss to Trump, who earned 49.7% of the vote in Michigan. \n\n“The question comes down to a choice between two people,” Whitmer said. “And what we saw in this last election, while Kamala Harris didn’t beat President Trump, we saw women get elected across the country, … win up and down the ballot in hard, important states to win.”\n\nWhitmer referenced Slotkin, who won a close race for the state’s vacant U.S. Senate seat in 2024, along with new governors Abigail Spanberger in Virginia and Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey, both of whom were elected in 2025.","summary":"Former first lady Michelle Obama said the country is not ready for a woman president.

This included his false claim -- unprecedented for US presidents -- to have won the election which he lost to Biden in 2020.\n\n\"We've done more than any other administration has done, by far, in terms of military, in terms of ending wars, in terms of completing wars,\" said Trump, who returned to office on January 20 last year after defeating Democratic then-vice president Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.\n\n\"Nobody's really seen very much like it.\"\n\nWhite House aides circulated a 31-page document listing 365 claimed \"wins\" across immigration, the economy and foreign policy, as reporters packed the briefing room.\n\nThe president repeated a series of claims long disputed or debunked, including that his 2020 election loss was \"rigged,\" that prescription drug prices had fallen by 600 percent -- a mathematical impossibility -- and that the United States had attracted $18 trillion in inward investment.\n\nAt various points, Trump described himself as a \"financial genius\" and faulted his own staff for failing to adequately communicate what he portrayed as major successes in bringing down inflation.\n\nOn foreign affairs, the Republican signaled an interest in working with Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado on the country's future, following Washington’s January 3 military operation that removed Nicolás Maduro from power.\n\n\"We're talking to her,\" Trump said. \"Maybe we can get her involved in some way. I'd love to be able to do that.\"\n\nHe praised Machado for giving him her Nobel Peace Prize medal, complaining again that the Norwegian committee should have honored him instead.","url":"https://www.moneycontrol.com/world/muted-anniversary-trump-marks-first-year-back-with-familiar-grievances-article-13782308.html","image":"https://images.moneycontrol.com/static-mcnews/2026/01/20260120180454_trump2rebalancing.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-20 19:57:12","author":"Siddharth Chakravorty","authors":["Siddharth Chakravorty"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.159},{"id":394662022,"title":"One Year In: Trump’s Show of Force","text":"As many of you know, Martin Luther King Jr. Day is a federal holiday, and many people have it off from work. That includes most of us at The American Spectator. While that included me for the most part, I can’t say the same about my night. There’s a three-word explanation for that: Donald J. Trump.\n\nTrump began his public-facing activities for the day by attending the CFP National Championship Game at Hard Rock Stadium between the Miami Hurricanes and the Indiana Hoosiers in Miami. Fans were reportedly advised to prepare for additional security measures, including screening by Secret Service agents.\n\nAfter arriving at the stadium at 7:18 p.m., Trump held court with family members and friends such as UFC CEO Dana White. Also spotted were cabinet secretaries (and one-time presidential primary rivals) Marco Rubio and Doug Burgum, as well as members of the Indiana congressional delegation. The latter were likely pleased by the evening, as the Hoosiers won 27-21, keeping their 16-0 win-to-loss ratio for the season intact.\n\nTrump left the stadium at 10:47 p.m., before the end of the 4th quarter. Upon his return to North Perry Airport, he fielded questions from the press for several minutes on the Nobel Prize, Greenland, and his new peace board. The president then departed via Air Force One to return to the White House. To those of us in the D.C. press pool waiting in the cold for his return, what was already a late night turned into a later one.\n\nWhy did Trump attend? Aside from the obvious reason that he just likes college football, there are others to consider. First, the president’s status as a cultural figure was a large part of how he assembled the coalition that returned him to power one year ago. That Trump is the kind of person who will attend college football games makes him more relatable.\n\nSecond, there’s the sharp contrast between Trump’s relentless schedule and that of his predecessor. During the 2024 election, Trump outworked both then-President Joe Biden and the eventual Democratic nominee, then-Vice President Kamala Harris. Regardless of what you think of his answers, the fact that he was willing and able to field questions from the press at 11 p.m. on a federal holiday is remarkable.\n\nIt was not until 1:50 a.m. that the D.C. contingent of the media was called to assemble in front of the Rose Garden. Even for me, a hale and healthy 27-year-old man, that’s not nothing. For the 79-year-old leader of the free world, that he had the energy to do any of this is remarkable. It’s certainly a major shake-up from the days of morning “lids” under President Biden.\n\nAfter Marine One landed just after 2 a.m., the president walked back into the White House. For reasons unknown, he did not seem inclined to stop in the 20-degree weather to answer my questions. It really hurt my feelings: I’m not sure what I did to offend him. Maybe he just doesn’t like me. Or perhaps he was just tired after a long day, to say nothing of a long year as the once again president of the United States. Difficult to say.\n\nREAD MORE from Stephan Kapustka:\n\nThe Prince and the Protests\n\nThe Running Man Is a Hicklib’s Fantasy Come to Life\n\nPoll: New Jersey Governor’s Race Too Close to Call","summary":"As many of you know, Martin Luther King Jr. Day is a federal holiday, and many people have it off...","url":"https://spectator.org/one-year-in-trumps-show-of-force/","image":"https://spectator.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_2351-e1768935274220.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-20 19:53:06","author":"Stephan Kapustka","authors":["Stephan Kapustka"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.11},{"id":394667404,"title":"Democrat praised by Trump says US is ‘ready’ for a woman president","text":"Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) said that the United States is “ready” for a woman to become president, setting herself apart from First Lady Michelle Obama.\n\nDuring an interview on NPR’s “Morning Edition” released Tuesday, Whitmer — a Democrat known for working with President Donald Trump — was asked about comments made by Obama in November, when she noted that the United States has “a lot of growing up to do” during a live conversation while promoting her new book, “The Look.”\n\n“As we saw in this past election, sadly, we ain’t ready,” Obama said in a discussion posted on YouTube, referencing how former Vice President Kamala Harris lost to Trump. “That’s why I’m like, don’t even look at me about running, because you all are lying. You’re not ready for a woman. You are not.”\n\nWhitmer, who has been floated as a potential Democratic contender in 2028, said that she loves Obama, adding that the “last thing I want to do is disagree with her.” But she then pivoted.\n\n“I think America is ready for a woman president,” Whitmer said. “You know, the question comes down to a choice between two people.”\n\n“What we saw in this last election — while Kamala Harris didn’t beat President Trump — we saw women get elected across the country,” she continued. “We saw, just recently, Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill got elected... we saw women win up and down the ballot in hard, important states to win.

During the interview, however, the governor took sharp aim at the president, arguing that his sweeping tariffs have “taken a terrible toll” and insisting that her swing state is preparing for voting disruptions by his administration during the 2026 midterm elections and in 2028.\n\nMeanwhile, Whitmer has hinted that she is not intentionally teeing up a future bid for the White House.

She eventually opted for Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN).\n\n“This is clearly Shapiro’s effort to weaken Harris before the presidential primary season begins,” Tim Blessings, political science professor at Alvernia University in Reading, Pennsylvania, told the Washington Examiner. He added that Shapiro is trying to “dictate the terms on which the contest between the two of them will be held” and that Harris now has to respond to Shapiro, not the other way around.\n\nBlessings framed the situation unfolding between the two Democratic heavyweights as a boxing match.\n\n“If you go back and look at the Muhammad Ali-George Foreman fight in Zaire, Ali would rush across the ring the moment the bell rang and try to get Foreman to react to him and not the other way around,” he said. “That, I suspect, is what Shapiro is up to.”\n\nHe added that he thinks the governor is “fuming at Harris on a personal level” and that “he was treated cavalierly by Harris.”\n\nOn paper, Shapiro was the strongest contender who could have delivered the battleground state for Democrats, but his lack of chemistry with Harris and their competing political ambitions seemed to dissolve any chance of a partnership.\n\nFor Shapiro, setting the record straight now about what went wrong not only puts to rest rumors but also allows him to look forward to 2028. In her book, 107 Days, Harris gave an inside look at the 3 1/2-month sprint for the White House after then-President Joe Biden dropped out of the race. Harris threw Shapiro, Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA), and Biden under the bus.\n\n“Who hasn’t Kamala Harris gone after since she lost?” Jeff Burton, founding partner at Maven Advocacy, told the Washington Examiner. Burton, a former senior National Republican Congressional Committee official, said Harris has been “clearly grasping and picking fights to stay relevant in a party that seems to want to leave her behind.” Harris has claimed Biden’s decision to run for a second term was based on “recklessness.”\n\nShe blamed Newsom for not being there enough for her and essentially accused Shapiro of measuring the drapes in the White House before getting the gig. She called the popular Keystone State governor out for allegedly asking about featuring Pennsylvania artists in the vice presidential residence. She claimed he insisted on being in the room for every decision she might make as president and hijacked the conversation during her interview with him for the job.\n\nHe called her a liar and pushed back hard on her portrayal of him as “selfish, petty, and monomaniacally ambitious,” in an interview with the Atlantic, saying she was “trying to sell books and cover her ass.”\n\n“I can tell you that her accounts are just blatant lies,” he continued.\n\nNow that it is Shapiro’s turn to sell a book, he is sharing his side of the vetting process and revealing it was much uglier than previously reported.\n\nShapiro’s problems with Harris’s vetting\n\nIn Where We Keep the Light, the Jewish governor dished that members of Harris’s team were hyperfocused on his views on Israel and that their questions crossed the line. At one point, they asked if he had been working covertly for the Middle Eastern country.\n\n“Had I been a double agent for Israel?” Shapiro wrote, describing his exasperation with the vetting team. “Was she kidding?”\n\nHe said he told Dana Remus, the former White House counsel who was doing the questioning, that it was an offensive question, and she answered that she needed to ask it.\n\nShapiro said the line of questioning then went from bad to worse. Remus allegedly asked the governor if he had ever spoken to an undercover Israeli agent, to which he responded, “If they were undercover, how the hell would I know?”\n\nShapiro was also asked if he would apologize for speaking out on antisemitism he saw taking place at the University of Pennsylvania. He said no.\n\nShapiro suggested the decision not to move forward with the vetting process went both ways and questioned whether he even wanted to be part of a process that would boot the sitting president out. He also claimed Harris’s team questioned whether he and his wife, Lori, could handle the financial burden of running for office, including spending thousands on a new wardrobe, hair, and makeup. He reached out to his wife, who was at a Walmart in Canada, and she said it was not the right time for the family.\n\nThe ”right time,” though, could be right around the corner.\n\nShapiro announced earlier this month that he was running for reelection in Pennsylvania, but there is widespread speculation that he will run for the White House in 2028. Last week, his campaign office refused to answer questions from the Washington Examiner about whether he would serve a full second term if reelected as governor, sidestepping the question and insisting he is focused on improving the key swing state.\n\nThe nonanswer, coupled with his flashy book tour, will inevitably fuel the firestorm of speculation that he is eyeing up a White House bid — and gives rivals such as Harris fresh ammunition to question his commitment and motives. For Harris, slamming Shapiro may not be the smart way to go if she is trying to stage a comeback.\n\n“Josh Shapiro is the sitting governor of a critical swing state, who will be easily reelected this year,” longtime political strategist Garry South told the Washington Examiner. “Harris is a former vice president who badly lost the last presidential election to Donald Trump, of all people. Polls show voters, even in her own state, don’t want her to run again in 2028. Their respective positions should give us a clue about which one to pay attention to.”\n\nHARRIS CAMPAIGN ASKED JOSH SHAPIRO IF HE WAS AN ISRAELI AGENT, NEW MEMOIR REVEALS \n\nPolitical strategist Adin Lenchner of Carroll Street Campaigns is also skeptical of a Harris win and said voters are not looking for just a familiar face, while Ashleigh Ewald, a Generation Z content creator for Harris’s 2024 campaign, told the Washington Examiner that younger voters may tune out all of the petty infighting.\n\n“What I hear consistently from younger voters is a desire for forward-looking leadership,” she said. “While contrast has always been part of politics, there’s growing fatigue when messaging relies too heavily on criticism rather than clearly outlining solutions. Voters respond most to concrete, transparent proposals on issues like affordable healthcare, economic stability, and protecting rights in ways that don’t increase everyday costs.”","summary":"The 2028 Democratic presidential primary campaign promises to be a far more cutthroat affair than the 2024 vintage, with voters getting an early sneak peek of things to come this week, thanks to a new book from Gov.

Kennedy stood before the nation and set a moral benchmark for the presidency. “And so, my fellow Americans: ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.” It was a line meant to define public service as sacrifice, not enrichment.More than sixty years later, that ideal stands in stark contrast to the presidency of Donald Trump, a presidency that, by multiple independent estimates, has become extraordinarily profitable for the man holding the office. According to figures cited by The New York Times editorial board, Trump has generated at least $1.4 billion since returning to the White House, a sum that has reignited concerns about conflicts of interest, foreign influence, and the merging of presidential authority with private business. The board cautioned that the number is likely conservative, as significant streams of income remain shielded from public disclosure. Overseas deals and policy overlapSince his reelection, the Trump family has earned at least $23 million from overseas licensing deals, according to The New York Times. At the same time, the Trump Organization is actively pursuing more than 20 international projects, including a luxury hotel in Oman, a commercial tower in western India, and a planned golf course near Riyadh.Many of these ventures depend directly on cooperation from foreign governments and have already delivered millions to the Trump family, Reuters reported. In Vietnam, the White House eased proposed tariffs roughly a month after construction began on a $1.5 billion Trump-branded golf resort outside Hanoi, a project that Vietnamese officials fast-tracked despite conflicts with local law.Qatar has also drawn scrutiny. The country provided Trump with a $400 million jet, which he is currently using as Air Force One and intends to keep after leaving office. During a visit to Doha, Trump publicly linked the relationship to U.S. policy, saying, “We are going to protect this country.”Lawsuits, settlements and corporate payoutsLegal settlements have become another lucrative revenue stream. Companies including X, ABC News, Meta, YouTube and Paramount have collectively paid $90.5 million to Trump or Trump-linked entities to resolve lawsuits, according to Reuters and The New York Times.Paramount alone agreed to a $16 million settlement over the editing of a Kamala Harris interview. Weeks later, federal regulators approved Paramount’s $8 billion merger with Skydance, a sequence that has intensified criticism from ethics experts, Reuters reported. Meanwhile, Amazon, owned by Jeff Bezos, agreed to pay $28 million for a documentary centered on Melania Trump, further adding to the family’s post-return earnings.Crypto windfall and the money trailThe largest share of Trump’s post-return income appears to come from cryptocurrency. Estimates cited by The New York Times place the Trump family’s crypto earnings at at least $867 million, though the true figure may be far higher. In an interview with the Financial Times, Eric Trump acknowledged that the family’s crypto income likely exceeds publicly reported estimates.Reuters has reported that Trump-affiliated cryptocurrency ventures allow both U.S. and foreign investors to purchase digital assets tied to the Trump family, creating a potential pathway for money to flow directly to the president’s private interests.One disclosed example involved a UAE-backed investment firm announcing plans to invest $2 billion in a Trump-linked company shortly before the administration approved the UAE’s access to advanced US semiconductor chips. Altogether, Trump’s estimated $1.4 billion haul since returning to office amounts to roughly 16,822 times the median U.S. household income, on top of entering office as the wealthiest president in American history.","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-jaw-dropping-1-4-billion-payday-since-returning-to-office-inside-the-deals-donors-and-the-secret-money-trail/articleshow/126852000.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-126852925/126852925.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-20 18:59:00","author":"Toi World Desk","authors":["Toi World Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.004},{"id":394630912,"title":"Larry Hogan bids farewell to elected politics after declining challenge to Wes Moore","text":"“I care deeply about the state of Maryland, and I remain concerned about the direction of our nation’s politics, but I have no intention of running for office again,” wrote Hogan. “It was an honor to serve, but it’s time to look forward, not back. The fight for Maryland and America’s future does not belong to any one person or any one party; it belongs to the people.”\n\nHogan’s exit likely benefits Moore, a 47-year-old rising star in the Democratic Party. Without Hogan, the gubernatorial field for Maryland Republicans includes no one with statewide name recognition.\n\nMoore is running for a second term in the 2026 midterm elections, an election he’s all but sure to win without the threat of Hogan’s centrist style of anti-Trump politics putting a “solid” Democratic state into play for the GOP. The incumbent has courted national attention and is seen as a possible 2028 presidential contender, ambitions Moore denies.\n\nThe Moore campaign declined to comment on Hogan’s announcement. It revealed Monday that Moore raised $7 million in 2025, the most ever raised in an off year in the Old Line State.\n\nMaryland Democrats long feared a challenge from Hogan, who stoked murmurs of a comeback run last year with a social media post made in jest to poke fun at Democrats for continuing to make him the frequent subject of their criticism.\n\nHogan reflected on his achievements as governor from 2015 to 2023 while resurfacing his deep displeasure with the nation’s broader politics that are “dominated by the well-connected.” He eviscerated lawmakers in Washington, situated only a 45-minute drive from the governor’s mansion in Annapolis, where he once resided.\n\n“Congress has come to resemble the nation’s most prestigious and self-obsessed retirement home instead of the vigor exemplified by the founders,” Hogan wrote. “We see it in the redistricting wars, waged by both sides, where maps are drawn in secret, behind closed doors, engineered to protect incumbents and shut out the upstarts who drive real change.”\n\nFor years, Hogan represented a red dot in a sea of blue that is Maryland politics, buoyed by his centrism and disdain for President Donald Trump. But his unsuccessful 2024 Senate bid was the latest indicator that even with Hogan’s name on the ballot, the future for Maryland Republicans was bleak. Vice President Kamala Harris’s 27-point victory over Trump was her second-largest margin in the nation, and Democrats now hold a supermajority in the General Assembly.\n\nHogan made the case that his victories were “unique and special but not unrepeatable,” urging Republicans to run candidates “who are willing to win with a positive message that appeals to more people.”\n\nAnd to both parties, he pushed for an embrace of term limits and nonpartisan redistricting “to break the grip of permanent incumbency and ensure that our government remains a revolving door for the best ideas, not a fortress for career politicians and ideas that never worked in the first place.”\n\n“We showed that when you refuse to let the fringes and factions get in the way of solving serious problems, you can actually come together and get things done,” he wrote. “We proved over and over again, through unprecedented trials, that the politics of our nation need not divide our state.”\n\n‘BOOGEYMAN’ LARRY HOGAN HAUNTS MARYLAND DEMOCRATS WITH FEARS OF WES MOORE CHALLENGE\n\nHogan indicated he’ll continue to engage on certain political issues despite retiring from elected politics.\n\n“I will continue to speak out on issues that matter, especially when our record has proven a better path forward,” he wrote. “And I will be working to inspire and support the next generation of civic leaders.”","summary":"Maryland Democrats can breathe a sigh of relief after the blue state’s popular former two-term Republican governor, Larry Hogan, announced Tuesday he would not mount a challenge to Gov.

Welch first entered the public eye as a cast member on Bravo’s reality television series “Sweet Home Oklahoma,” which she co-hosted with Angie Sullivan starting in 2017. The show eventually became “Sweet Home” in 2018.\n\nThe show focused on her life as an interior designer in Oklahoma City and her circle of liberal friends, highlighting their personal and social dynamics in a part of the country often deemed politically and culturally conservative.\n\nAfter “Sweet Home Oklahoma” ended, Welch returned to her interior design work, but she and Sullivan soon launched a podcast in October 2022 titled “I’ve Had It.” What began as a platform for venting about everyday frustrations quickly evolved into a politically charged commentary show with an unabashedly liberal viewpoint.\n\nIn its early seasons, the podcast’s mix of irreverence, profanity, and bold critique attracted a growing audience nationwide, even as it emerged from deep red Oklahoma — a state where most political media voices lean right. The show regularly features progressive politics, sharply criticizes Republican figures and pushes back against the Democratic establishment when Welch views it as too cautious.\n\nWelch’s outspoken commentary has translated into national visibility. (RELATED: Left-Wing Comedians Bowen Yang, Matt Rogers Warn Against Donating To Self-Absorbed Jasmine Crockett)\n\n“I’ve Had It” now ranks among the top political podcasts and boasts over a million followers on platforms like YouTube. It has also secured interviews with high-profile figures, including former President Barack Obama and former Vice President Kamala Harris. Welch has also become a frequent guest on cable news shows such as CNN and MSNBC, where she expands on her political views.\n\nHer pivot from reality TV personality to influential voice in the political realm has drawn praise from some on the left who see her as a fresh, relatable alternative to traditional liberal commentators. It has also drawn criticism from many conservatives who view her rhetoric as too extreme.\n\nWelch is a lifelong Democrat and atheist in the heart of the Bible Belt, speaking forcefully about national politics from a perspective shaped by her experiences in a predominantly conservative community.\n\nIn just a few years, the combination of reality TV roots, criticisms of political norms and an unfiltered media style have helped Welch become a prominent and polarizing figure in contemporary political media.","summary":"Welch is a lifelong Democrat and atheist.","url":"https://dailycaller.com/2026/01/20/jennifer-welch-oklahoma-reality-star-politics-podcast/","image":"https://images.dailycaller.com/image/width=1280,height=549,fit=cover,format=webp,f=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn01.dailycaller.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2026%2F01%2FGettyImages-2077153887-scaled-e1768931031906.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-20 18:43:19","author":"Leena Nasir","authors":["Leena Nasir"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.545},{"id":394634346,"title":"Josh Shapiro reveals Kamala Harris didn't want collaborative relationship with her VP, disliked her own job","text":"Gov. Josh Shapiro, D-Pa., reveals in his new book that Kamala Harris didn't appear to want a vice president to directly voice their opinion to her and said that she didn't seem to like the job either as he underwent the vetting process to be her potential running mate in 2024. The governor wrote in his new book, \"Where We Keep the Light,\" that he had a knot in his stomach throughout his meeting with Harris, who was vice president to President Joe Biden, and the vetting process to be her VP when she was the 2024 Democratic candidate. Shapiro wrote that Harris was \"crystal clear\" that she did not want the type of relationship where her VP would baldly state his opinions, even if he promised to back her final decision. \"If we had door A and door B as options, and she was for door A and I was for door B, I just wanted to make sure that I could make the case for door B, and if I didn’t convince her, then I’d run right through a brick wall to support her decision,\" he wrote, according to The New York Times. \"She was crystal clear that that was not what she was looking for.\" JON STEWART SLAMS KAMALA HARRIS OVER HER EXPLANATION OF WHY SHE SNUBBED PETE BUTTIGIEG FOR VP Harris alluded to this in her memoir, \"107 Days,\" as well, as she detailed her decision-making process that ultimately led her to choose Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. Shapiro was considered as a running mate given he was governor of a large swing state and enjoyed high approval ratings, but he and Harris never meshed. Harris cited in her book, \"a nagging concern that he would be unable to settle for a role as number two and that it would wear on our partnership.\" \"It could have gone differently, had I left that meeting thinking that she would want a partner and someone to bounce things off of before she ultimately made her decision,\" Shapiro wrote in his account, according to The Washington Post. \"There was a world in which it could have worked, but that was not this world.\" Shapiro also indicated in the book, according to reports, that Harris did not like being vice president to former President Joe Biden. JOSH SHAPIRO DEFENDS CLAIM THAT KAMALA HARRIS TRYING TO ‘COVER HER A--’ WITH CRITICAL BOOK EXCERPT \"She noted that her chief of staff would be giving me my directions, lamented that the Vice President didn’t have a private bathroom in their office and how difficult it was for her at times not to have a voice in decision making,\" he wrote, according to the Times. Shapiro said he decided to withdraw himself from contention after meeting with Harris toward the end of the vetting process. When he asked to be connected with Harris to convey the news, he was told, according to the Times, \"the VP would not handle bad news well and that I shouldn’t push.\" Harris did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. Shapiro's book is set to be released next week. In it, he also described being questioned by Harris' staff about being a possible agent for Israel. CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE The Atlantic reported on a section of the book devoted to what he described as \"unnecessarily contentious\" questions from Harris' team — particularly former Biden aide Dana Remus, who asked him about being a possible Israeli double agent. \"Had I been a double agent for Israel? Was she kidding? I told her how offensive the question was,\" Shapiro wrote. \"Remus was just doing her job. I get it. But the fact that she asked, or was told to ask that question by someone else, said a lot about some of the people around the VP,\" he added.

The reason, the report concluded, was President Donald Trump’s aggressive immigration policies.\n\n“The report attributed the shift to a combination of the large drop in entries and an increase in enforcement activity leading to removals and voluntary departures,” ABC reported.\n\nThis is an important milestone as we reach the end of Trump’s first year in office. The reckless immigration policies of President Joe Biden turned the American people decidedly against immigration, both illegal and legal. Those policies would have almost certainly continued if Vice President Kamala Harris has won in 2024. \n\nWe’ve really seen an incredible turnaround. Just a few years ago, border towns were completely overrun by illegal aliens. The only defense border states had was to ship the newcomers off to norther sanctuary cities that also became entirely overwhelmed.\n\nThat’s halted entirely. The New York Times ran a story Sunday about how migrant shelter in McAllen, Texas—which had been packed to the gills under Biden was now practically vacant.\n\n“We have not seen a single migrant in months,” Sister Norma Pimentel, who runs the facility, said to the Times in December. “We are completely empty.”\n\nThat’s an incredible change.\n\nEven after their decisive defeat, Democrats have shown no loss of zeal for their open border policies as they do everything in their power to impede enforcement of the law in states and localities they control.\n\nNevertheless, the past year proves—that under the right leadership—America’s immigration laws can be enforced. It’s not impossible. We didn’t need additional legislation that did little more than put a Band-Aid on the problem and give cover to open-borders politicians. We just needed new leadership at the top.\n\nThis isn’t to say that Trump succeeded in other areas. As I and others have written, his administration has effectively run a counterrevolution against the deep state bureaucracy and the DEI ideology that’s infected practically every corner of American society.\n\nIt can legitimately be said that no Republican president has done more to curtail the bureaucracy and its surrounding web of parasitic, woke NGO’s than Trump in his second term.\n\nBut it’s on the border and immigration in which Trump 2.0 has had the most astounding success.\n\nSure, many Trump supporters are disappointed that deportations haven’t happened fast enough. Some Republicans now lament that the ICE raids in blue states are getting too “messy,” and will surely turn the public against the administration.\n\nHowever, given the challenge Trump faced when he returned to office after four years of President Joe Biden, it’s impossible to imagine the 47th president handling the situation without any major complications.\n\nIn the four years under Biden, Customs and Border Patrol recorded 11 million encounters at the border. Millions of illegal immigrants were simply allowed into the country under bogus asylum claims or were given notices of court appearances years in the future.\n\nAnd as we’ve seen, some of those courts were willing to play fast and loose with the law to ensure that deportations wouldn’t take place.\n\nThat’s in part what the Trump administration is attempting to untangle, with Democrat-run “sanctuary states” doing everything in their power (and a fair bit outside their official power) to impede that effort.\n\nHere’s a brief review of Trump’s impressive record on the border one year into his second term.\n\nEarly Actions to Undo Biden’s Manufactured Border Crisis\n\nWhen Trump returned to office the first thing he did was to sign an executive order declaring the southern border situation a national emergency, allowing him to deploy additional resources to stem the Biden tide.\n\nHe also reinstituted the “Remain in Mexico” policy, which forces asylum seekers to stay in Mexico while they await a decision in their case. The “catch and release” policies of Biden were abandoned.\n\nThe administration funded detention facilities to house illegal aliens on the way to deportation, including “Alligator Alcatraz,” a massive facility built in the Florida Everglades.\n\nThe One Big Beautiful Bill, signed into law on July 4, allocated $170 billion for immigration enforcement. It provided funding for a surge in Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and ensured that deportations would continue to be fully funded for the remainder of Trump’s presidency.\n\nWith these moves, the Trump administration showed that it wasn’t just going to halt Biden’s immigration policies, it intended to reverse them.\n\nThe Way is Shut\n\nThe effect of Trump’s pivot was immediate.\n\nIn June of 2024, Border Patrol agents apprehended 83,536 illegal aliens at the southern border. That was the lowest of the entire Biden presidency. Most months, that number was well over 100,000, and reached over 250,000 at its peak in 2023.\n\nUnder Trump, that number has fallen to a trickle. Center Square reported on the astounding difference in the two presidencies. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, which began in October, Border Patrol “recorded the lowest illegal border crosser encounter/apprehension totals ever reported” at the start of a fiscal year.\n\n “A total of 91,603 encounters/apprehensions were reported nationwide—lower than any prior fiscal year to date, according to the latest CBP data,” wrote Center Square’s Bethany Blankley. “By comparison, record highs were reported under the Biden administration of 392,196 in Q1 of fiscal 2025; 988,512 in Q1 of fiscal 2024; and 865,333 in Q1 fiscal 2023, according to the data.”\n\nNoem celebrated this accomplishment on X.\n\nEven more importantly, and this is almost certainly why those numbers fell so dramatically, the Trump administration just recorded its eighth straight month of allowing zero parole releases into the country.\n\nThe bogus asylum seekers have melted away because they know that they are wasting their time. They can’t just show up at the border and expect to melt away into the U.S. population as they once did.\n\nICE Raids and the Future\n\nThe Left didn’t sit still while Trump undid one of their foundational policies. Democrat-run sanctuary states have done their best to put up as many roadblocks to deportation as possible. This has created a challenging situation for the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nDHS noted in early January that ICE agents “now face a more than 1,300% increase in assaults, a 3,200% increase in vehicular attacks against them, and an 8,000% increase in death threats.”\n\nICE now must conduct frequent raids in blue states rather than pick up illegal immigrants detained by local authorities if it wants to enforce federal law. This has put ICE agents in more danger as leftwing activists and dangerous illegal immigrants have often attempted to impede their operations.\n\nThis is in part how the tragedy that led to an ICE agent shooting a woman in Minnesota took place.\n\nWill this deter the administration?\n\nTrump suggested that he may invoke the Insurrection Act in response to local Democrat officials, including Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacon Frey, continuing to openly defy the federal government.\n\nTrump seems to be serious about carrying out his election promise despite whatever resistance Democrats throw at him. Is there more work to be done? Yes. Still, it’s not hard to imagine how different things would have been had Walz and Harris had won. It would have been four more years of Biden’s unimpeded border madness.","summary":"What a difference a year makes.

The first after his victory in 2016 shows a smiling Trump, probably delighted to have won against the odds and, at least in theory, willing to work with his opponents. \n\nThe second shows a more brooding figure glaring into the camera – a man who recognises that a sizeable chunk of the country is never going to like him and does not care. This second image encapsulates what I see as the twin themes of Trump’s second term: revenge and legacy.\n\nIn 1973, American political scientist Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr introduced the concept of the “imperial presidency”. He argued that the separation of powers that lies at the heart of US democracy had become overbalanced under the presidency of Richard Nixon in favour of the executive branch.\n\nIn response to the Vietnam war and the Watergate scandal, where operatives working for Nixon bugged the Democrat National Committee’s headquarters and he tried to cover it up, Congress reasserted itself. The war powers resolution of 1973, for example, required the president to consult with Congress before committing US armed forces to conflict.\n\nThe Obama administration also shows how effectively a president’s agenda can be derailed when one party puts its mind to it. Republicans blocked Obama’s appointments to the judiciary and significantly watered down his main achievement, the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHowever, Trump’s second administration has seen the imperial presidency reach its peak. He has wielded this power against his political enemies, whether other politicians, media organisations or foreign governments, more forcefully than at any point during his first presidency. \n\nThis has been shown by various legal cases, as well as his threat to sue Paramount over a pre-election interview with rival presidential nominee Kamala Harris on CBS News that Trump felt unduly favoured her. Paramount settled by agreeing to pay US$16 million (£11.9 million) to Trump’s future library.\n\nIt is also striking how much more organised Trump’s second administration has been. There will forever be a debate about whether Trump really expected to win back in 2016, but it’s obvious there had been a lack of planning. This was shown by the disjointed policy agenda and appointments to key positions of people who were either not as loyal as he would have wished or not up to the roll. \n\nTrump’s first national security advisor, Michael Flynn, lasted only 24 days in his post, while communications director Anthony Scaramucci lasted ten. Trump’s government is staffed by ultra-loyalists this time round, including Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, FBI Director Kash Patel and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth. \n\nThere have still been embarrassing mistakes, including the leak of information about imminent military strikes in Yemen. But Trump’s government has been notably more focused and organised than in his initial presidency. \n\nMiller’s America First Legal Foundation, for example, spent the Biden years creating policy agendas and drafting executive orders. Because of this pre-planning, Trump could appoint his second cabinet much faster than his first and hit the ground running. What followed was a flurry of executive orders and legislation on immigration, federal regulations and the economy.\n\nOn January 20 2025, Donald Trump was sworn in as the 47th president of the United States. His first year in office has seen profound changes both in his own country and across the globe. In this series, The Conversation’s international affairs team aims to capture the mood after the first year of Trump’s second coming.\n\nCementing his legacy\n\nTrump cannot run for the presidency again according to the US constitution, despite his trolling on the subject. While his first presidency was focused on his ultimately failed efforts at reelection, the next three years are all about legacy.\n\nEvery US president has actions that can be undone by their successors. In Trump’s case, future Democratic presidents can change the renamed Gulf of America back to the Gulf of Mexico. But Trump’s second term has also seen him aim for seismic changes that cannot be easily reversed. \n\nChief among these is Greenland. What was initially perhaps a passing fancy to bring the Danish-administered territory under US control has turned into a key pillar of his post-presidency ambitions. If Trump succeeds in making Greenland part of the US, then he will have increased the size of the US’s land possessions by roughly 22%. \n\nIt would be difficult for any future president to hand it back without being accused of weakness and ceding territorial gains. Similarly, cementing Venezuela as a client state would reshape regional dynamics in ways that will be difficult to reverse. Appointing himself as chair of the Gaza “peace board” for life again speaks to a man trying to create a permanent legacy.\n\nAnother aim is reconfiguring the federal government. This process was started during his first term by reshaping the Supreme Court to give it a conservative majority that, barring accidents or illness, will last over 20 years. Trump has now turned his attention to the rest of the system. \n\nHis aim is to appoint judges and administrators that cannot be removed easily by future administrations, cementing his policy agenda on a generation. Trump has repeatedly stated his wish to fire Jerome Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, and replace him with someone more in tune with his thinking.\n\nThe main obstacle is Congress. Trump’s first term taught him that the much-lauded checks and balances of the US constitution are stronger on paper than in practice. With strength of will, billionaire supporters and a disposition to take legal action, these mechanisms can be circumvented or ignored. But they can slow him down.\n\nThis is why the midterm elections in November are so important. If a president’s party holds the House and Senate when they enter office, as was the case for Trump after the 2024 election, they often lose it two years later. And if the Democrats gain control of the House then they can hobble his legislative agenda.\n\nIn some ways, Trump’s biggest legacy will be the resurgence of the imperial presidency. He has shown future administrations what can be done if they’re willing to ignore political norms. On many occasions during his first term Trump voiced variations of “nobody has done what I’ve been able to do”. In his second term, he seems set on turning political rhetoric into indisputable fact.","summary":"Trump has wielded his presidential power more forcefully than at any point during his first term.","url":"https://theconversation.com/trumps-second-term-is-proving-different-from-his-first-this-time-its-imperial-273712","image":"https://images.theconversation.com/files/713344/original/file-20260120-56-da676w.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C282%2C8192%2C4096&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-20 18:09:55","author":"Lecturer in Politics and International Relations,Matthew Mokhefi-Ashton,Nottingham Trent University","authors":["Lecturer in Politics and International Relations","Matthew Mokhefi-Ashton","Nottingham Trent University"],"language":"en","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.244},{"id":394599682,"title":"Hate in the time of Trump: The perils of being Indian in MAGAland","text":"It was October 2025. The spotlight came on. The room fell quiet.Fifty-three-year-old Salil Maniktahla stepped onto a stand-up stage, visibly nervous. This was not a polished set built on everyday observations. The material came from somewhere else entirely. It came from his own life.“I grew up in rural Mississippi in the early seventies, which explains a lot about me,” he told the audience.Growing up there, Salil learned early what it meant to be visible in the wrong way.Looking back, he described the state plainly. “It is aggressively number 50. In everything it does, it is always aggressively dead last, like it is collecting Pokémon cards for failure.”“Everything that could be done badly, Mississippi will do it even worse,” he added.Salil was born in the United States in 1972, a year after his parents moved there. Then he turned to childhood.“Growing up, I was an overachiever; it is kind of a bit like being LeBron James in a second-grade gym class. Everyone knows you don't belong, you are the wrong skin colour, and everyone hates you,” Salil joked.The audience laughed. The line landed. But the jokes barely covered what followed..Marked from the startYears of abuse, discrimination and bullying shaped his childhood. The reason? His skin colour did not match what many white Americans believed belonged in their country.“In elementary school, I was the only brown kid, and I got called the N-word. I got bullied, beaten up, harassed, just constantly. And when you are a kid, you don’t know it is not normal. I just accepted it as a kid. And then later, as an adult, I looked back at it, and I definitely felt more of a sense of rage,” Salil told me.“Even as a kid, I would just feel frustrated and angry a lot of the time because it never felt like anyone was ever stepping in to help, you know, it was clearly an extreme bullying situation, but no adults in my life really ever intervened in any way. And I knew it was wrong, but I felt fairly powerless a lot of the time,” he continued.It was repeatedly made clear to him that he did not belong, that he was different.The pressure did not always arrive as open hostility. Sometimes, it worked by quietly asking him to adjust.“When I was younger, yes. I wanted to assimilate very, very badly. I just wanted to fit in. My nickname growing up was Jay, and it was not a part of my name. My mom proposed it when I was in first grade, I believe, because so many people struggled with saying Salil in Mississippi. And in fact, my first-grade teacher, I believe, called me Sally and then she was like, how about we just call you Jay? And I was Jay until I was probably around 30. At which point I thought, why am I why am I doing this? Like, this is stupid. It's not my name. I'm just doing it to make life easier for people that I don't even know. And it literally doesn't even seem to make any difference in their attitudes. They're still exactly the same kind of jackass, whether I have an easy name or a hard name.”The effort to assimilate did not soften the hostility. It only shifted the burden onto him.“If you were brown, then you were the N-word. Probably right around middle school is when they started getting creative with epithets. Because it's when I first heard the term sand N-word or turban head or dot head, at least those, and even then, I remember having a bit of a sense of humour about it, like at least they're finally figuring out that I'm not black. It's very stupid, it was such a stupid time,” he said with a hearty chuckle.This was the early 1980s. One might assume that four decades later, things would have changed.They have not..Same sh*t, different placeYears later, in Arlington, Virginia, Salil was out to dinner with a friend when a stranger approached their table.“This guy, who is younger, walks in. He recognises my friend by face. And so he comes to chat with her and say hi. And in that interaction, he introduces himself to me, sticks his hand out and starts trying to crush my hand while shaking it. And he sort of refuses to let go of my hand,” Salil said.The interaction quickly turned unsettling.The stranger asked Salil if anyone had told him that he had beautiful eyes. Salil remembered how uncomfortable he felt.“Then he kissed my forehead, after which I yanked my hand away.”What followed was not embarrassment, but escalation.“So rather than process that embarrassment, he started getting angry, and he came back. It was like he had a target, so he started unloading on me.”The insults came fast. Sexual slurs. Threats of rape. Mockery of his Indian identity. Fantasies of violence. He told him he would be deported now that Trump was president. He promised to wait outside and “kick my ass”.“He made fun of me being from India. He said, 'You must be a lesbian with your earrings. So you probably dance Bharatanatyam in your living room.' It's just very strange,” Salil added.Salil tried to de-escalate. He tried not to engage. The man kept going.“No one stepped in or intervened in any way. The restaurant did nothing.”When the police arrived, they asked if he wanted to press charges.He said yes.“They really didn't feel like they were taking it seriously,” he said later.No one had been hurt. It was just a man “running his mouth”. Something smaller than what the police usually deal with. Something easy to let go of.Salil did not.“I've had situations like this occur in the past, and I kind of feel like I've had enough.”What struck him was not just the abuse, but the familiarity of it.“He kind of slowly escalated… then he trots out this whole thing like you know Trump is president now, and you're gonna have to go back to your country, you're gonna get deported.”The language was incoherent, but the rage? It was not..Same script, different placesSalil’s story is not an exception; it is part of a much wider pattern, one that stretches across the United States, one that repeats itself in parks, workplaces, laundromats and hotel lobbies, more often than not without warning.“You also see cases where it's just people living their everyday lives, getting attacked. Go to a fast food restaurant, go to the laundromat, go to school, and there's just, you never know, like out of nowhere, someone could direct an attack towards you,” Stephanie Chan, Director of Data & Research for Stop AAPI Hate, a national coalition tracking racism and discrimination against Asian and Pacific Islander communities, told me.The incidents differ in detail. The language rarely does.“I was in the park with my three-year-old when some teenagers let out N-words and F-words,” an Indian woman in Maryland reported. “After we left, one of them followed us and said, ‘Indians smell’.”In Texas, an Indian woman described a confrontation at work.“A customer came in asking for help… he started yelling profanities and proceeded to say, ‘I am glad Trump is deporting you bitches. I hope you have a green card'.”In a laundromat, a graduate student watched a stranger’s smile turn to rage.“I don’t want to see ugly, smelly Asians here!” the woman shouted, before smashing a dryer door and storming out.Others describe quieter humiliation.“Workers refused to allow me to sign up for a class… told me my kind aren't valued there,” a woman in Los Angeles County reported. “As I left, the employee gestured the middle finger towards me.”Sometimes it is reduced to a single sentence.“At a hotel lobby, a person walked by an Indian American man and yelled, ‘go back to India!’”Different places. Different people.The same language.However, what makes it different now is how openly it is expressed.And how closely it follows power..When stories start repeatingThe stories from parks, workplaces and laundromats are a pattern.That pattern becomes much clearer when personal accounts are placed alongside data collected over time.According to STOP AAPI Hate, tens of thousands of slurs targeting South Asians circulate across online spaces every month.The organisation tracks hate through three main channels: a national survey, a reporting centre where people submit incidents they have experienced or witnessed, and online monitoring carried out with research partners who focus on extremist and high-risk digital spaces.What we can understand from this data is not just the massive scale of the hate acts, but also when it happened.Since January 2023, STOP AAPI Hate has documented a steady rise in anti–South Asian hate online. The graph features three distinct spikes -- and they are not something that appeared randomly. Each of these spikes followed moments when South Asians were put under the spotlight in American public life.The first spike came after the entry of Kamala Harris into the presidential race, alongside the increased visibility of other Indian-origin political figures, like the wife of JD Vance, Usha Vance. Online spaces associated with extremist rhetoric saw a sudden surge in slurs and threats, despite no corresponding event involving the wider South Asian community.The second, and most significant, spike came immediately after Donald Trump returned to office following the 2024 election. In the weeks that followed, online hate targeting South Asians intensified alongside renewed political debates around immigration, particularly H-1B visas.A third spike followed months later, as geopolitical tensions rose and Zohran Mamdani gained national attention after winning the Democratic primary in New York City. That visibility triggered another wave of racially charged and Islamophobic abuse online..Salil noticed the shift long before it appeared in datasets.“After Trump was elected the first time in 2016, that’s really when I saw this kind of spike,” he said, recalling an increase in harassment in his own neighbourhood.FBI data show that since Trump’s election there has been an anomalous spike in hate crimes concentrated in counties where Trump won by larger margins. It was the second-largest uptick in hate crimes in 25 years.The underlying connection among all the spikes is simple -- visibility and hate rhetoric.As Stephanie explained, increases in political, cultural or global visibility are often followed by surges in hate directed not just at public figures, but at the broader ordinary South Asian population going about their daily lives.Data suggests that when South Asians enter national conversations, whether through elections, policy debates or international events, online spaces quickly respond with language that seeks to push them back out.While most of the time these hate campaigns restrict themselves to cyberspace, sometimes they step off the screen -- thanks to the racist rhetoric being fuelled by MAGA cultists.The numbers reveal when hate spikes. The language reveals how it operates.The slurs dominating online spaces today are not just random insults. They are part of a long tradition of using words to mark who belongs, and who does not..Sometimes words speak louderTerms like “Jeet” and “Pajeet”, “Chink” and “Ching Chang Chong”, “Gook” and “Paki” dominate many of the online spaces where South Asians are targeted today.Some of these slurs are products of the internet age, born in anonymous forums like 4chan and extremist message boards. Others have circulated for decades, embedded in American history and public life.What connects them is not just cruelty, but function..Slurs rarely emerge at random. They appear during moments of uncertainty and anxiety, such as economic pressure, political change, or demographic shifts. Moments when fear demands a target.Language becomes a pathway to turn entire communities into cardboard cutouts, to mass generalisation, making them easier to blame, exclude or threaten.Experts tracking online hate say that many of the most common slurs used against South Asians today first appeared in far-right digital spaces before spreading outward. Repetition does the rest. What begins as fringe speech becomes familiar. Familiar becomes acceptable. And acceptable becomes usable.Over time, these words travel. They slip from comment sections to classrooms, workplaces and streets.Long before online platforms existed, the same process unfolded through newspapers, political speeches and pop-culture.In the early twentieth century, South Asian immigration was framed as a “dusky peril”, presented as an even greater threat than the so-called “yellow peril”..Newspapers and political speeches warned of racial contamination, economic competition and cultural decay. The language helped justify exclusionary laws long before violence followed.During the Second World War, Japanese Americans were forcibly incarcerated after being transformed, through words, into enemies. Slurs like “jap” and “nip” entered mainstream use, reducing people to threats and making mass punishment seem acceptable.After 9/11, South Asian and Muslim Americans were broadly labelled “terrorists”, regardless of nationality or religion. Surveillance, detention and profiling followed.Two decades later came the COVID-19 pandemic, and the pattern repeated itself. When Donald Trump used phrases like “China virus” and “kung flu”, anti-Asian slurs surged nationwide, followed by physical attacks and harassment.Language moved first. Violence came behind.In today’s hyper-connected world, slurs travel faster, reach wider audiences and solidify into shared vocabularies of hate. Words coined in extremist right-wing forums can enter mainstream political discourse within days. When repeated by people in positions of authority, they gain legitimacy, even when rooted in falsehood.Slurs are often dismissed as “just words”. They are not.Each carries a lineage of fear and exclusion. Each helps define who belongs and who does not. Language does not stay contained. Once normalised, it begins to shape behaviour, whether in online spaces or in offline ones.And once behaviour shifts, words no longer need explanation; they arrive with pre-conceived notions..Same script, different crisisLanguage not only dehumanises in the moment; it follows a script, one that resurfaces whenever fear needs a face.Each surge of racial hostility in the United States arrives with the assurance that it is exceptional. That this time is different. That the danger is new.History suggests otherwise.I asked Manjusha Kulkarni, Co-Founder of Stop AAPI Hate and Executive Director of AAPI Equity Alliance, and Stephanie to compare the current rise in anti–South Asian hate with earlier moments, particularly after 9/11 and during the COVID-19 pandemic.“Each is slightly different than the other, though they all fall under the rubric of anti-Asian or anti-AAPI hate,” Manjusha said.After 9/11, the logic was national security. Muslim Americans were blamed collectively for an act carried out by a few. Because a large proportion of Muslims in the United States trace their roots to South Asia, the fallout landed heavily on South Asian communities. Low-income families were especially exposed, facing heightened police scrutiny, harassment and discrimination, particularly in large metropolitan areas.During the COVID-19 pandemic, the trigger shifted. The origins of the virus were externalised, racialised and simplified. Chinese Americans were blamed first, then Asian Americans more broadly. What mattered was not accuracy, but appearance.In both moments, the targets quickly expanded beyond the group originally named. Sikh Americans wearing turbans were attacked after 9/11, not because perpetrators understood who they were, but because visual cues replaced knowledge.During the pandemic, anyone who “looked East Asian” -- people of Korean, Japanese, and Southeast Asian origin -- became fair game.What united these episodes was not the identity of the scapegoat, but the mechanism.“After 9/11, it was national security scapegoating. With COVID-19, it was public health scapegoating. And now with this current rise in anti-South Asian hate, it’s economic scapegoating,” she said.At a moment of sustained economic pressure, such as rising prices, unaffordable housing, and job insecurity, resentment looks for a target. Immigration, particularly skilled migration, becomes an easy explanation for structural failure. Suddenly, blame replaces policy.Manjusha places this cycle within a longer American tradition.The Chinese Exclusion Act of the late 19th century, and the mass incarceration of Japanese Americans during the Second World War, were not spontaneous public reactions but government-initiated responses that legitimised collective punishment.What is unfolding now follows the same architecture. Communities are not targeted for what they have done, but for what they represent during moments of national anxiety.The present wave is still taking shape. So far, Indian Americans appear to be the primary focus, but history suggests the boundaries will not hold. Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Sri Lankan, and Nepali communities sit within the same line of sight.The lesson, repeated across decades, is simple. In times of crisis, America does not just look for answers. It looks for someone to blame.And once that script is written and repeated, it does not remain confined to history books or online forums, it looks for somewhere to be acted out..From the screens to the streetsHate, more often than not, is dismissed as noise. It is ugly, it is offensive; however, it was restricted to the screen, or so it was believed.The very thick line between online hate and real-life hate crime has been blurred entirely.The language circulating online does not remain confined to digital spaces. It shapes how people speak, what they feel permitted to say, and increasingly, how they act.In recent years, slurs and threats directed at South Asians have travelled from fringe message boards to mainstream platforms, and from there into everyday interactions in the real world.Harassment increasingly borrows from political rhetoric and debates. Phrases that often mirror campaign slogans and official talking points surface in everyday spaces.The escalation is not always physical, it is deliberate.Threats now invoke the power of the state. Deportation, detention and surveillance are used as tools of intimidation, regardless of a person’s legal status.The message is no longer just hostility, but control, a reminder that belonging can be questioned, revoked or taken away without a moment’s notice.This is not something that happened accidentally.Digital spaces reward repetition. Slurs, conspiracy theories and false claims are amplified through algorithms that prioritise engagement over facts and accuracy. Over time, exposure hardens into belief. What begins as rhetoric becomes justification - an echo chamber is born.What becomes clear, both from research and from lived experience, is that when dehumanising language is repeated enough times, it lowers the barrier to harm. The move from speech to action does not require coordination. It requires permission - the sense that certain targets are acceptable, and that consequences are unlikely.For South Asians in the United States, this has translated into a new kind of vulnerability. Abuse no longer feels random. It feels rehearsed. The same phrases repeat across different states, spoken by different people, as if drawn from a shared script.The result is a climate where fear operates quietly. People hesitate before speaking up, before drawing attention to themselves.Online hate may begin as words. But when those words are repeated, legitimised and carried into the real world, they begin to function as threats.And increasingly, they are treated as such.For many, that threat is no longer abstract or lurking in the shadows.It now arrives with flashing lights and sirens, masks, unmarked vehicles and legal authority.It no longer stops at words, but carries the weight of the state..Knock, Knock; ICE there?In recent years, harassment has increasingly invoked immigration enforcement as a tool of intimidation.“I’ll call ICE.” “Trump will deport you.” “You won’t be here much longer.”These phrases reflect a growing awareness that government power can be summoned casually and that it does not always discriminate carefully between citizens, permanent residents, students or visa holders.Manjusha explained how people now use the authority of the state as part of everyday harassment.“Now people are saying, ‘Trump will deport you,’” she said. “They’re using the power of the state in their harassment.”What makes this moment distinct is not simply the presence of racism, but the way enforcement has been used to spearhead it.Reports describe individuals being picked up in public places, transported far from their communities and held without clear information about where they are or when they will be released. In some cases, people are detained despite having valid documentation.Recollecting one such incident, Manjusha told me.“One individual here in Los Angeles was on a bus, and then ICE came and dragged him off the bus, took him to a detention facility 200 miles away. He was there incommunicado. Nobody knew where he was.”He was released two days later.“He has a valid visa,” she added.The message these incidents send is not subtle.Legal status does not guarantee protection. Due process is no longer assumed. The boundary between documented and undocumented begins to blur.For many, the uncertainty itself becomes the punishment..The impact reaches beyond those without citizenship. Families with long histories in the United States report making contingency plans, getting OCI cards if they haven't had it already, making sure they're ready should they need to leave at a moment's notice for the safety of themselves and their family members.“I came to the United States when I was two with my parents. My husband came from India when he was three with his parents and sister. And we're very worried. We've lived here for over 50 years and we're worried for ourselves and our children. And I didn't think I would ever be saying that,” Manjusha said.Fear, in this context, is not hysteria. It is a strategic calculation.When enforcement appears unpredictable, visibility itself becomes risky. Speaking out feels dangerous. Silence begins to feel like self-preservation.This is how racism operates when it is embedded in systems rather than shouted from street corners. It does not need mobs. It does not require flashy spectacles. It works through procedures, and for those caught within them, the damage is often quiet and often devastating.It was shaped, encouraged and normalised from the top.The point is simple, such words have the power to flatten identities and erase differences. Coincidentally, that has been the purpose of the MAGA campaign.Which brings us to the main cause behind the recent surge in hate against south-Asians -- the re-emergence of the MAGA echo chamber..The Second Coming of the Trum-pestEvery movement needs a prophet. MAGA found one.Donald Trump did not arrive as a saviour from nowhere. He was announced, prepared, and recognised long before he descended the escalator.To his followers, he was not merely a candidate. He was restoration made flesh. The man who would take the country back. The one who would punish enemies and cleanse institutions.When Trump announced his return to presidential politics in November 2022, he spoke in the language of deliverance.“We have to save our country.”America, he suggested, had fallen. It had been corrupted. Taken over. Redemption required force.This was not a conversion. It was confirmation.Long before MAGA had a name, Trump’s public life followed a familiar script. In 1973, the US Department of Justice sued Trump and his company, Trump Management, for housing discrimination against African Americans. The allegation was simple: Black renters were turned away, lied to, or steered elsewhere. Trump settled the case by agreeing to stop the practices, without admitting wrongdoing.There was no confession. No repentance. Only denial.In 1989, when a white woman was assaulted in Central Park, Trump did not wait for a trial. He placed full-page advertisements calling for the death penalty. Five Black and Latino teenagers -- Kevin Richardson, Raymond Santana, Antron McCray, Yusef Salaam and Korey Wise -- were accused and convicted.Years later, DNA evidence proved they were innocent. The convictions were overturned. The city acknowledged the injustice.Trump did not.More than three decades later, the same men, now in their 50s, filed a lawsuit against Trump for defamation, accusing him of repeating false claims about them during a presidential debate. Even then, there was no reckoning. Only insistence.In MAGA theology, the chosen one does not apologise..Between 2011 and 2016, Trump became the high priest of the birther conspiracy, falsely claiming that Barack Obama was not born in the United States. The lie was disproved. Trump repeated it anyway. Belonging, once again, was the target. Citizenship was something to be doubted, withdrawn, denied.This is the doctrine that underpins MAGA: America is pure only when it is white, Christian, and unchallenged. Everyone else is provisional.Central to this belief system is the claim of “anti-white racism”. The claim that recasts historical dominance as injury and privilege as persecution. In this framing, efforts to address inequality are taken as attacks, and demands for inclusion are treated as acts of aggression.Diversity is no longer presented as a social reality, but as discrimination. Multiculturalism becomes contamination. Demographic change is framed not as evolution, but as invasion.This rhetoric does not exist in isolation. It echoes through campaign speeches, policy debates, media appearances and online spaces, reinforcing a worldview in which America is imagined as something that has been taken, diluted, or corrupted.South Asians -- increasingly visible in politics, technology and public life -- become convenient stand-ins for these anxieties, regardless of their individual actions or beliefs.What follows is not merely a change in tone, but a shift in permission.When national leaders speak of the country being “taken over” or its “blood being poisoned”, they redraw the boundaries of acceptable speech.After Trump returned to office following the 2024 election, online hate directed at South Asians surged, closely tracking campaign rhetoric and subsequent policy debates. Immigration became a focal point for resentment.This was not unprecedented. During Trump’s first term, similar spikes followed moments when immigration, race and national identity were foregrounded. What changed the second time was intensity. The language grew sharper. The policies more aggressive. The institutions enforcing them more emboldened.By the time Trump left office in 2020, two-thirds of surveyed Americans told the ACLU that he had increased racial tensions in the country.Grievance politics thrives on simplification. Complex social and economic problems are reduced to slogans, and entire communities are flattened into symbols that are blamed not for what they have done, but for what they represent.Trump’s language reflects this belief. Immigrants “poison the blood”. Demographic change is framed as an invasion. Equality is framed as persecution.In a recent statement on South Africa, Trump claimed, in typical Trump fashion without evidence, that white farmers were facing “genocide”.He accused the government of killing white people and stealing their land, while casting the international media as complicit through silence. On the basis of this claim, he proposed punishment: exclusion from global forums, withdrawal of cooperation, and public condemnation.The episode was not about South Africa. It was about grievance. Whiteness was positioned as endangered, violence was asserted without proof, and authority was invoked to promise consequences.The facts were secondary. It was foreign policy spoken like scripture.The righteous named. The wicked condemned. Consequences promised.The same logic travels easily across borders, and when applied at home, it places visible, non-white communities like South Asians firmly on the other side of belonging.This is how Trump governs language. Falsehoods are not mistakes. They are revelations. Each claim, no matter how debunked, is treated as truth because it feels true to the faithful.What more can you expect from a “narcissistic man-child surrounded by yes men”.MAGA does not require accuracy. It requires belief..For South Asians in the United States, this matters even when Trump does not name them directly. MAGA works by ranking who belongs and who does not. It operates through hierarchy. Through the idea that some belong by divine right, while others remain guests.When a leader speaks of “taking the country back”, the question is always the same: back from whom?Visibility becomes provocation. Presence becomes transgression.The language spoken from pulpits of power travels downward. It appears later in restaurants, offices, parks and classrooms. Harassment borrows the tone of prophecy. Threats arrive dressed as destiny.What Trump offers his followers is not just policy. It is absolution.Absolution for suspicion.Absolution for cruelty.Absolution for the belief that exclusion is righteousness.In MAGA, Trump is not seen as accountable for the consequences of his language He is treated as the voice of truth and reason. And like all messianic figures, he does not need to be right.He only needs believers..After the signalMovements do not run on belief alone. They require systems that repeat a belief until it feels normal.Political rhetoric does not act in isolation. It travels through platforms, institutions and intermediaries that absorb, amplify and normalise it.Over the past decade, an ecosystem has formed around grievance politics, one that does not reflect hostility but distributes it.At the centre of this ecosystem is repetition.Claims about immigration, race and national decline are circulated endlessly, stripped of context and consequence. Complexity is a liability. Simplicity travels faster. What survives is not what is accurate, but what is repeatable.Social media accelerates this process. Platforms reward outrage with visibility, pushing the most inflammatory content furthest and fastest.Stephanie points to how this environment reshapes authority itself.“Trump spends so much time on social media,” she said.“And one of the ways he kind of susses out who is loyal is by looking at what people are posting. Checking whether they are aligned with him, or if they are favourable to him.”In this ecosystem, loyalty replaces competence. Visibility becomes the main qualification.The result is an administration and a political culture, shaped not by expertise but by amplification. Podcast hosts, influencers and online provocateurs move seamlessly into positions of power, not despite their extremism, but because of it. Their social media reach, useful. Their aggression signals allegiance..The frightening power Laura Loomer wields in Trump's America.Manjusha describes this as structural rather than incidental. Trump, she said, “purposely picks people who are unqualified, because what that then does is it ramps up the loyalty. They know they are only in those positions because of their loyalty, not because of competence.”However, loyalty is also only relevant if you belong to a colour of his choice.According to research, Trump has assembled the least diverse US government of the 21st century, filling the corridors of power with white men at the expense of women and people of colour.Nine in 10 individuals confirmed by the Senate in the first 300 days of the second Trump administration were white.Trump has also used online spaces to spread his hate politics. Influencers do not merely comment on political developments; they translate them into usable language such as slogans, jokes, threats and slurs that can be easily redeployed. The line between commentary and instruction blurs.Mainstream media, meanwhile, struggles to respond without reinforcing the cycle.In the pursuit of balance, explicit racism is often reframed as controversy. Statements are paraphrased to soften their impact. Harmful claims are discussed without being named directly. What should alarm instead becomes debatable, becomes quirky. The effect is dilution, the effect is harm.Technology companies sit comfortably within this structure.Platforms that once promoted themselves as neutral hosts increasingly shape what is seen, shared and suppressed. Safeguards against hate speech and misinformation have been weakened or completely removed. Engagement and access outweigh safety.As Stephanie put it very bluntly, “Meta, as well as X, don’t even want to address safety and hate speech anymore. They’ve removed a lot of the protections they had before.”The consequences are clear. Language that circulates freely online becomes portable. It moves from comment sections into workplaces, classrooms and public spaces, carried by people who feel increasingly confident that they will face little resistance.Together, these forces create what researchers call as permission structures.No one is explicitly told to harass, threaten or intimidate. Instead, they pick up on cues - Who is protected. Who is suspect. What language is acceptable. What consequences are unlikely.For South Asians navigating this landscape, harassment feels coordinated even when it is not. The same phrases recur across different states, spoken by different people, as if drawn from a shared script.The system does not invent prejudice. It sustains it, it gives it confidence, reach and durability.And once sustained, it no longer needs to shout. It simply waits to be acted upon..Then it actsPermission, once granted, looks for something to act through.Once hostility is normalised, it seeks instruments. In the United States, those instruments are policies, agencies and people empowered to act in the name of the state. What begins as rhetoric is translated into enforcement. What feels like belief becomes procedure.This system did not come together on its own. It has been shaped by figures who rarely occupy the spotlight but exert lasting influence over how power is used. Among them is Stephen Miller, the long-time architect of Donald Trump’s immigration agenda, whose work across administrations has focused less on reform than on restriction, deterrence and spectacle.Policies bearing his imprint have expanded enforcement while narrowing accountability, turning immigration law into a tool not just of regulation, but of intimidation.“Not only has he been an influence, he’s actually the one who executes the policies, right? So it is his plans that are going forward,” Manjusha said.“He has been very clear about efforts to detain and deport people even since the first term.”For South Asians, this shift has been marked by the increasing use of immigration enforcement as a tool of intimidation. Deportation, detention and investigation are no longer distant bureaucratic processes. They are invoked casually, often by strangers, as threats.“We have received numerous incident reports where an individual was just at a restaurant and somebody came up to him and said, ‘Trump will deport you,’” Manjusha said.“So when people on the right say there’s nothing coordinated, that these are just policies, that’s not true. His supporters understand the link between rhetoric, policy and action.”This is not limited to undocumented people.Detentions have been reported involving international students, visa holders and even those who have US citizenship. People have been picked up in public places, held without clear explanation, and released days later without charges. The uncertainty is the point. When enforcement appears arbitrary, everyone becomes vulnerable..Speaking on the misadventures of ICE, Stephanie says, “ICE is terrorising our communities. People are staying home. They’re not going out. Their lives are being completely disrupted by the fear that they will get deported unlawfully.”What makes this moment more unsettling is that the machinery is not operated solely by those outside the communities being targeted.Indian Americans themselves occupy key positions within it. Far from being symbolic appointments, they are actively taking part in reshaping civil rights enforcement and immigration policy. Their presence further complicates any simple narrative of representation as protection.As Manjusha pointed out, “There are two Indian Americans who are actively participating in that. Kash Patel and Harmeet Dhillon. Harmeet Dhillon is supposedly the head of the Civil Rights Division. She’s actually made a mockery of that with her actions.”Representation, in this context, does not protect the people or soften the system. It legitimises it..State power does not discriminate based on shared identity. It operates through authority, not solidarity. When people from marginalised communities administer exclusionary policies, the system does not become less hostile. It becomes harder to challenge.And the consequences are visible everywhere.The instances such as the international student being pulled off a bus by immigration authorities mentioned earlier are not isolated errors. They are signals.As Manjusha put it, “These are kidnappings. These are abductions. Most of them are without any warrants. There’s no government authorisation. They’re just picking people up.”What emerges is not chaos, but control.The state does not need to announce repression loudly, but here it does, and then, permission has fully transformed into power..Fear, silence, survivalThe most immediate consequence of this environment is not confrontation. It is withdrawal.Across South Asian communities, fear shapes ordinary decisions. People think twice before reporting abuse, before speaking publicly, before drawing attention to themselves. The risk is not just further harassment, but scrutiny from everywhere, including the state.For those on temporary visas, the calculation is constant. Students, skilled workers and families with time-bound status learn quickly that visibility carries cost. A single incident can feel consequential. A misunderstanding can feel dangerous. Silence becomes a form of protection.Stephanie sees this pattern repeatedly in the reports STOP AAPI Hate receives.“There’s a lot of trepidation in sharing with us,” she said. “Community leaders tell us their people are experiencing this, but they don’t want to report. They don’t want to draw attention to themselves right now.”The fear extends beyond those without legal status..Citizens and permanent residents also describe altering their behaviour. Protests are avoided. Online activity is limited. Political opinions are softened or withheld entirely. Big Brother is watching -- the mania, real or imagined, becomes part of daily life.Reporting mechanisms exist, but trust in them is uneven. Many incidents go unreported, not because they are minor, but because the cost of speaking feels higher than the promise of resolution.Stephanie described the findings of a recent student survey.“A lot of the fear we’re hearing from students is, ‘I’m going to be detained. I’m going to lose my child.’” Even when no law has changed, the atmosphere has.For some families, preparation has replaced expectation.The psychological toll is cumulative. Anxiety becomes routine. Normal activities require calculation. Public spaces that once felt familiar begin to feel exposed.And yet, survival also takes quieter forms.Mutual aid networks grow discreetly. Community groups share information under the radar. People look out for one another in ways that rarely make headlines. Resistance, in this context, is not always loud. Sometimes, it is simply persistence; it is survival.Silence should not be mistaken for acceptance. In many cases, it is the price of staying safe..Pushback, uneven and incompleteBut fear has not gone unanswered.Across the United States, resistance has begun to surface, albeit unevenly, and often cautiously. Protests, electoral shifts and community organising suggest that while intimidation has reshaped daily life for many, it has not gone uncontested.Large-scale demonstrations have drawn many into public spaces, framing the present moment not as routine politics but as a challenge to democratic norms themselves. These gatherings have brought together people across racial and ideological lines, united less by agreement on policy than by a shared concern about the concentration of power and the erosion of rights.For Stephanie, these moments matter, even when their impact feels limited. “People are gathering around the protection of democracy,” she said, referring to the nationwide No Kings protests.“It’s a big enough umbrella that grabs people who disagree on a lot of things, but can still agree on that.”When hate spills from the screen to the streets, so does the pushback. The number of people attending the October 18, 2025 'No Kings' protest exceeded that of both Trump inaugurations combined..Signs of pushback have also emerged at the ballot box. In several high-profile races, candidates who centred affordability, civil rights and inclusion outperformed expectations, despite facing sustained racial and religious attacks.For South Asian voters in particular, turnout reflected a growing recognition that visibility carries risk, but silence carries cost.Stephanie said Mamdani’s recent win in New York City “felt like a loud repudiation of what’s been happening.”Younger voters have played a notable role in this shift. On college campuses and in urban centres, long lines and high participation rates suggest a generation less willing to treat authoritarian politics as background noise. For many, this is not an abstract debate, but a question of personal safety and future possibility.However, Manjusha remains cautious about overstating what this means.“The far right people will never change,” she said. “But there may be a middle ground where people are waking up, especially when their economic interests are at stake.”Community organisations have also stepped into the gaps left by institutions. Legal aid groups, advocacy networks and grassroots collectives have expanded their work quietly, often under-resourced and overstretched. Their efforts rarely attract national attention, but they provide infrastructure where official systems have failed to inspire trust.“We as a citizenry have shown much more courage and bravery than elected officials have. And sadly, we can't win this fight unless we work together across all sectors,” Manjusha said..None of this guarantees change.“The coming year will be decisive in what happens for the rest of my lifetime,” she added.The forces driving resentment and exclusion remain powerful, well-funded and deeply entrenched. Gains, where they exist, are partial and reversible. Progress does not arrive evenly, and it does not arrive safely.But these moments of resistance matter precisely because they occur within a climate designed to shrink public space. They challenge the idea that fear is total, or that permission to intimidate goes uncontested.Participation, in this context, is not triumph. It is refusal - a refusal that, at its narrowest, is left with just three words --.fight fight fight……Not as a chant or a vow, but a decision to remain present within a system that strives to wear people down.A year into a familiar administration, the accounts gathered across interviews, data and incident reports point to a climate that has not cooled. If anything, it has hardened. What once surfaced at the margins now appears with greater confidence, borrowing the language of politics, policy and power..For many South Asians in the United States, the threat is no longer abstract or episodic. It is ambient. It sits inside ordinary life, shaping how visible one can afford to be.Salil understands this instinctively. When he walks onto a stage, he does not frame himself as a survivor or a spokesperson. He tells stories. He jokes. He lets the audience laugh. But the laughter is never detached from what sits beneath it -- a childhood shaped by hostility, an adulthood lived with vigilance, and a present in which old language has returned with new authority.Comedy does not insulate him from what is happening outside the room. It does not undo the years of being told he did not belong, or the more recent reminders that belonging can still be questioned, withdrawn, or taken away. What it offers instead is something narrower, and more fragile: a way to speak without asking permission. A way to be visible without apology.For Salil, the question of belonging has never resolved itself into a single place.“I don't think I've ever fully felt at home in America. I feel like I've carved out my own little spaces. And there have been times where I've let my guard down. But as an adult, I've been very aware that that can get snatched away very quickly.“A lot of the anger or resentment I feel has to do with me living my life, minding my business, and then something will happen that just reminds me that I am not treated as if I belong here, that I'm not American, that I am something else. And also that I should be happy about it. I should be grateful for the privilege of being allowed to live here at all and that they can take it away from me, rightly or not.”India does not offer him refuge either. When he returns, he is reminded just as quickly that he does not fully belong there. He is read as American, shaped by distance, accent and absence. What is denied in one place is not reclaimed in the other.There is no neat ending to this story. The forces that exclude remain active. Some people respond through art. Some through organising. Some through silence. None of these responses promises safety. None promises resolution.History rarely returns all at once. More often, it moves quietly, repeating itself in familiar forms, until the question is no longer whether it is coming but when.

Civil rights activist the Rev. Al Sharpton joined him on the stage as he unleashed on the Trump administration. \"We are witnessing the weaponization of the Department of Justice by the president and his lackeys to silence his critics and to intimidate voters,\" he continued. \"We are observing gestapo tactics by federal immigration law enforcement in Minnesota as well as around the country.\" DEM SENATOR WARNER ADMITS BIDEN 'SCREWED UP' THE BORDER, BUT CLAIMS ICE NOW TARGETING NON-CRIMINALS \"You all remember the name Renee Good. And you say her name, you say her name,\" Holder continued. Democrats across the country have spoken out against the Trump administration's deportation efforts of illegal immigrants for the past year, accusing federal law enforcement of terrorizing communities with their presence and arrests. Rhetoric against ICE and other federal officers heightened in January when an ICE agent fatally shot Renee Good in Minneapolis. Federal officials said Good attempted to use her vehicle as a weapon against the ICE agent, defending the officer's actions of opening fire on the woman. Democrats and critics of the immigration policies have described Good's death as a \"murder\" at the hands of the government, heightening protests in Minneapolis and elsewhere. \"As dark as things may seem now, we must remember that every generation has been similarly tested, and each time Americans face really a critical question: Do we sit back and hope that help comes along, or do we stand together and fight? Fight for what we believe,\" Holder continued in his Monday remarks. Fox News Digital reached out to the White House and Holder's office for additional comment Tuesday morning and has not received a reply. TRUMP SAYS MEDIA FOCUSES TOO MUCH ON MINNESOTA ICE COVERAGE, NOT ENOUGH ON CORRUPTION ALLEGATIONS Federal law enforcement officers converged on Minneapolis at the start of the new year as a sweeping fraud scandal rocked the state. Dozens of people, most of whom are from the Somali community, have been arrested over alleged involvement in the schemes where suspects falsely claimed federal reimbursements — totaling what federal prosecutors believe is at least $1 billion in fraud. Days later, Good was shot and sparked an increase of protests in the Twin Cities, including agitators disrupting worship services at a church Sunday. \"There is no low these radical leftists won’t stoop to,\" White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson told Fox News Digital Monday morning of the church protests. \"Jacob Frey and Tim Walz have whipped these rioters into a frenzy and turned them loose to wreak havoc on Minneapolis.\" \"Frey and Walz should be ashamed for inciting such chaos, but the Trump Administration will continue enforcing the law,\" she added. Minnesota’s sprawling fraud scandal started reshaping the state’s political landscape earlier in January, when Gov. Tim Walz announced he would not run again for governor as questions mounted about oversight breakdowns during his tenure. Walz said the scheme unfolded on his watch and took ownership of the scandal, but argued Republicans were \"sensationalizing\" the fallout. PROMINENT CATHOLIC BISHOP SLAMS ANTI-ICE AGITATORS WHO DISRUPTED MN CHURCH SERVICE: 'UNACCEPTABLE' Walz notably ran as former Vice President Kamala Harris' 2024 running mate, with Holder leading the vetting process of Harris' potential picks and ultimately giving the Minnesota governor his seal of approval. Holder celebrated from the campaign trail that year of Walz's background that there was \"nothing … of any substance that was missed by our vetting team.\" A source with knowledge of Walz's vetting process previously told Fox News Digital that the fraud investigation was included in the vetting process, as details had already emerged during the governor's 2022 re-election race.

Especially on the Townhall Media platform? I could have consulted with my pal Larry O'Connor on this question, since he just got named Townhall's managing editor, but I'm pretty sure he would have told me to lead with that and see what happens.\n\nAs you can see, I chose a wiser path in the end.\n\nLast week's Golden Globes was notable for many omissions, chief among them hardly a syllable of support for the tens of thousands of Iranians being massacred in the streets. Maher, however, took notice of one glaring omission that directly relates to the purpose of the awards themselves. This was the first year in which the Golden Globes included podcasts as a category, and yet it left off the most influential and arguably popular podcast in the US – one which had a particular, if indirect, impact on the presidential election in 2024. \n\nHow deep in the \"BlueSky bubble\" do you have to be, Maher wondered on his Club Random podcast, to ignore Joe Rogan? Dana Carvey and David Spade seem equally mystified, starting roughly at the 1-hour, 20-minute mark (NSFW):\n\nMAHER: I'm sure there were good shows. But it was glaring that Joe Rogan was not nominated.CARVEY: For Best Function?MAHER: Yeah. I mean. It is kind of popular.CARVEY: It is known.MAHER: It is known.CARVEY: He's absolutely brilliant at what he does.MAHER: And he's very good at what. Exactly.So you're going to have an inaugural podcast category.CARVEY: And you don't have [Joe Rogan].MAHER: It just speaks to living in the blue sky bubble. But get out of your f*cking bubble, you know. I want to be one of you. I am one of you. But you're just so hard to defend. Because you're such f*cking smug a**holes. And this town is the epicenter of the problem.\n\nThe irony here, of course, is that Joe Rogan isn't a political conservative. He launched his podcast as a Bernie Bro, more of a generic populist than an outright socialist, but still clearly to the left of center. The failures of the Biden Regency soured Rogan on the Left, but he has never been a hat-wearing member of MAGA, preferring more distance from any kind of movement. He offered both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris spots on his podcast to discuss their agendas; Trump enthusiastically engaged, while Harris snubbed Rogan. \n\nThe \"Blue Sky bubble\" ignored Rogan not because he's conservative, but because he refuses to live in the Blue Sky bubble with them. And that may explain another awards-season snub, one that prompted some sharp criticism from Landman's Billy Bob Thornton:\n\nYou’ve spoken candidly in the past about award shows in Hollywood. Compared to its success, it seems that “Landman” and other Taylor Sheridan shows are sometimes underrepresented in award conversations. Why do you think that is?I think a lot of it’s political. I really do. I think some people assume Taylor is some sort of right-wing guy or something, and he’s really not. Even with this show being about the oil business, he just shows you what it’s like. He’s not saying “Rah, rah, rah for oil.” It’s just the people who work in this business or who are affected by this business, the people on the periphery and within the families in the business; this is what happens. These are the kinds of problems and joys and triumphs and whatever happens in this world. It’s a world of gambling, and you never know what’s going to happen. But I think people got the wrong idea about that.\n\nThe knock on Landman is that it's become a platform for conservative rants from some of the characters, including Thornton's. This season apparently features a Karen-esque college-student character named \"Paigyn,\" which sounds contrived but also on point as a foil for some of the rants in question. However, that sounds no more contrived than anything else Hollywood produces for the Blue Sky didactic, and like Rogan, Sheridan may not even be conservative. Just his openness to other viewpoints is enough to disqualify him from recognition, however, as it does Rogan. \n\nChristian Toto and I will have more on this later in our Off the Beaten Path episode. That too will receive no nominations for a Golden Globe, but that's a lot less mystifying than Rogan's snub. \n\nEditor’s Note: Here at Hot Air, we’ve been dealing with real government suppression of free speech for YEARS.

There, he falsely claimed Trump was part of a \"human sex-trafficking network,\" in what appeared to be a reference to Jeffrey Epstein's criminal enterprise. The allegation wasn't some throwaway line, either. Kasky doubled down, despite multiple opportunities to walk it back, creating significant legal exposure for the network.\n\nThe incident began as a discussion about Trump’s quest to acquire Greenland, when, apropos of nothing, Kasky made the false claim.\n\n“I am appreciative that the president is being transparent about this. I would love it if he was more transparent about the human sex-trafficking network that he was a part of, but you can’t win them all,” he said.\n\n“Cameron’s grateful that the president is being transparent about the Nobel Peace Prize and his desires for Greenland,” host John Berman repeated. “Scott, what do you think about that?”\n\nJennings immediately objected. “Are you going to let that sit?” he asked. “Are we going to claim here on CNN that the president is part of a global sex trafficking ring, or —”\n\nBerman cut in, attempting to bring the conversation under control. “Well, I mean, we’re going to talk about the Epstein file,” he said. “Well, I mean, we're going to talk about the Epstein file. Scott, I will do the fact-checking as we go along here. Repeat what you said about the global sex trafficking ring?”\n\nKasky did not retreat. “That Donald Trump was provably very involved with it,” he said.\n\n“Okay, we'll get to that later,” Berman said. “I mean, Donald Trump has never been charged with any crimes in relation to Jeffrey Epstein.”\n\nKasky interrupted, dismissing the legal point. “Yes, but let’s be adults,” he said. When Berman continued trying to move on, Kasky added, “Let’s be serious.”\n\nThe tense back-and-forth ended with Berman attempting to close the exchange and restore order, turning back to Jennings and asking, “Satisfied?”\n\nA smug 25-year-old leftist activist just got HUMBLED live on CNN by Scott Jennings.Cameron Kasky claimed President Trump was part of a “human sex-trafficking network” — and for a moment, the panel let it slide.Until @ScottJenningsKY stepped in and FORCED the host John Berman… pic.twitter.com/wRxV2sQ3B5— Overton (@overton_news) January 20, 2026\n\nThe conversation moved on, but the damage was already done. Nothing Kasky said was true. President Trump has never been credibly accused of participating in any of Jeffrey Epstein’s crimes. Networks understand this, which is why they typically insert legal caveats when the subject comes up. They know the difference between reporting facts and floating defamatory insinuations.\n\nICYMI: Michelle Obama Said Something Really Racist Again\n\nKasky blew past that line when he declared that Trump “was provably very involved with it.” That was not mere careless phrasing. It was a flat assertion of fact, and a false one.\n\nPointing out that Trump was never charged does nothing to absolve Kasky’s claim. Berman effectively allowed a baseless allegation to linger unchallenged. While it’s true that Trump hasn’t been charged with anything, the real issue here is that Trump has never even been credibly accused of involvement in Epstein’s crimes, and there is zero evidence tying him to them in any way.\n\nKasky didn’t present his claim as an opinion or speculation either. He accused a sitting president of serious criminal conduct and presented it as indisputable truth.\n\nWhy is this a problem for CNN?\n\nTrump is suing the BBC for $10 billion for deceptively editing his speech on Jan. 6, 2021, to make it appear he told his supporters to storm the Capitol. While that case is ongoing, Trump has had a string of successes with similar lawsuits. Meta agreed to pay $25 million to settle Trump’s lawsuit over his suspension from Facebook. Alphabet paid a $22 million settlement for suspending Trump’s YouTube channel. CBS settled with Trump for $16 million over its deceptive edits of Kamala Harris’s 60 Minutes interview in a blatant attempt at election interference. ABC News settled with Trump for $15 million over George Stephanopoulos’s false claims about him. These companies did not settle out of charity or goodwill.\n\nWill CNN be the next network that Trump sues for defamation? It should be.\n\nEditor’s Note: The mainstream media isn't interested in the facts; they're only interested in attacking the president.

Meanwhile, Amazon, owned by billionaire Jeff Bezos, has agreed to pay $28 million for a documentary centered on Melania Trump. \n\nTech and media companies have collectively shelled out $90.5 million to Trump through legal settlements. Qatar, meanwhile, provided a $400 million jet that Trump is using as Air Force One and plans to keep after leaving office.\n\nThe biggest gains appear to come from crypto. The Trumps have pulled in at least $867 million from cryptocurrency ventures, a figure that could be far higher. But Eric Trump has acknowledged the family’s crypto earnings likely exceed public estimates during an interview with the Financial Times.\n\nAltogether, Trump’s post-return haul amounts to roughly 16,822 times the median U.S. household income—on top of entering office as the wealthiest president in American history.\n\nIt comes as the Trump Organization is currently pursuing more than 20 projects abroad, including a luxury hotel in Oman, a commercial tower in western India, and a planned golf course near Riyadh. \n\nMany of these developments depend on cooperation from foreign governments—and have already delivered millions to the Trump family, according to Reuters.\n\nAnd the administration has also taken actions that benefit those same countries.\n\nIn one notable case, the White House eased proposed tariffs on Vietnam roughly a month after construction began on a $1.5 billion Trump-branded golf resort outside Hanoi, a project Vietnamese officials fast-tracked despite conflicts with local law.\n\nLegal settlements have also padded Trump’s bottom line.

Trump’s standing as one of the most polarizing figures in modern American political history has been both a blessing and a curse for him. His approval rating only a few months into his second term (47% in a March poll by NBC News) fell below his predecessors’ early marks, but it also matched his best showing from his first term, as he’s been buoyed this time by an energized Republican Party base remade in his image. Americans’ views of Trump have declined over the course of his first year back in office, with approval ratings hovering around 40% in public polls released in the last few weeks, with some variance as high as 45% but as low as 39%. That’s roughly where he was after the first year of his first term, around where President Joe Biden stood at this time in his term, and somewhat lower than several other recent presidencies one year in. As Trump’s approval rating has ticked down, he’s also lost ground on issues that helped propel him into the White House. He told NBC News’ “Meet the Press” a month after his 2024 victory, “I won on the border, and I won on groceries.” But voter views of his handling of immigration enforcement and the economy have declined over the past year. The specific issue of border security, though, has remained one of Trump’s biggest strengths, according to the available polling. Altogether, Trump’s struggles on some key issues could be setting up a tough political environment for the GOP going into this fall’s midterm elections, which are typically a referendum on the president’s party. Republicans are already trailing by several points on the question of which party voters would like to see control Congress next year, and the Republican advantage on the economy relative to Democrats has narrowed, too. Economy Americans have largely soured on Trump’s handling of the economy, particularly the cost of living and high prices. Those attitudes have effectively erased his long-held advantage on the issue, creating headaches for Republicans at the ballot box. Americans have been especially wary about Trump’s sweeping tariffs, a signature policy of his first year in office. Trump closed out his first term in 2020 with majorities approving of how he handled the economy, even as he went on to lose that election to Biden. In his comeback campaign, he enjoyed double-digit advantages over then-Vice President Kamala Harris on the economy and the cost of living when he defeated her in 2024. During the first few months of Trump’s current term, his approval rating on the economy hovered in the mid-40s, but it has since dropped several points. An AP-NORC survey conducted Jan. 8-11 found 37% of Americans approve of how Trump is handling the economy, while a Reuters-Ipsos survey conducted Jan. 12-13 found his economic approval rating at 34%, while 30% approved of his handling of inflation. The Wall Street Journal found those ratings slightly higher: 44% approval on the economy and 41% on inflation and rising prices. An NBC News poll from late October found around two-thirds of registered voters said Trump and his administration had fallen short of their expectations on inflation and the cost of living, looking out for the middle class and the economy. Around one-third said Trump had lived up to their expectations on those issues. And an NBC News Decision Desk Poll powered by SurveyMonkey conducted in late November and early December illustrated why those low economic ratings are such an issue for the White House. It showed 44% of Americans, the largest share in the poll, saying inflation and the cost of living was the economic issue that mattered most to them and their families. The next closest issue, at 13%, was health care costs. Trump, meanwhile, has oscillated between touting measures to address concerns about high costs and arguing that such concerns are being overblown by his political opponents. “In the coming weeks, I will be laying out even more plans to help bring back affordability,” the president said during a speech in Detroit last week. “And again, remember, that’s a fake word by Democrats.” Trump also touted his tariff agenda in that speech, saying they “have delivered us trillions of dollars of new investment, unprecedented new partnerships on minerals, rare earths, defense and artificial intelligence, and historic levels of foreign military sales.” But a December CBS/YouGov survey found 63% of Americans oppose the U.S. placing new tariffs on goods from other countries, with 68% saying they drove up prices in 2025 and 59% saying they expect tariffs to drive up prices in 2026. Recent polling has also shown why struggling on the economy could be a problem for Trump as voters cast their ballots later this year. The NBC News poll from October found 38% of registered voters saying Republicans would do a better job handling the economy, while 37% said Democrats would be the better choice on the issue. That was the smallest advantage Republicans have had on the issue since 2017. And the NBC News Decision Desk Poll conducted late last year found a narrow majority of U.S. adults saying they trust the Democratic Party to handle the rising price of everyday things compared to the Republican Party, 53%-47%. Immigration Trump’s aggressive promises on immigration and border security were a centerpiece of his campaign, too. But Americans’ broad ratings on his handling of immigration, in particular, have declined since he took office. When Trump returned to the White House, polling regularly had him near, or clearing, majority approval on immigration and border security. Polling last month from Fox and AP-NORC still found Trump with a slim majority approval rating on border security. But he fares worse when respondents are asked about immigration as a separate issue. Trump’s approval on immigration across a handful of polls — conducted by CBS/YouGov, Fox News and Quinnipiac — in the final month of 2025 came in around the mid-40s, while the Wall Street Journal poll came in at 48%. And early January polling from CNN and AP-NORC — conducted largely after a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer fatally shot a woman in Minneapolis — found Trump’s approval ratings on immigration at 42% and 38%, respectively. There are still some relative bright spots for Trump on the issue. CNBC’s December poll found adults relatively split on Trump’s handling of “deporting illegal immigrants,” and a CBS/YouGov poll from the same month found that a majority of adults said Trump’s policies are decreasing the number of migrants crossing the border with Mexico. Since the start of Trump’s second term, polling has shown Americans are far more supportive of deporting immigrants who have committed other crimes after entering the country illegally than they are of more widespread deportations. The public has been especially sour on deporting those with American children or those who have been in America for many years. The January CNN poll found 52% of adults said Trump has gone too far when it comes to deporting immigrants living in the country illegally, while 31% said the administration has struck the right balance. At this point, it’s unclear what long-term political fallout, if any, Trump and his administration could face from the aftermath of the ICE shooting in Minneapolis. Polling from Quinnipiac found that 57% of registered voters disapproved of how ICE is enforcing immigration laws broadly, and CNN found that 51% of adults said ICE enforcement is making American cities less safe, while 31% said the enforcement is making cities safer. Foreign policy Trump’s high-stakes foreign policy moves have generated some of the biggest headlines of his first year in office, particularly in the second half of last year. Overall, his approval rating on foreign policy has hovered around 40% in recent polling, a slight decline from the mid-40s at the start of his term. More broadly, the late October NBC News poll found that 53% of registered voters said his administration has fallen short of their expectations on foreign policy, while 44% said it’s lived up to expectations. And a new CNN poll found that 57% of adults think that Trump’s foreign policy decisions have hurt America’s standing in the world, while 31% say they’ve helped. Americans have been split over the administration’s decision to capture Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro. But as the Trump administration moves to exert influence on the new government and the South American nation’s oil production, polling from CBS/YouGov and CNN found that majorities disapprove of Trump’s handling of the broader situation in Venezuela. On another part of Trump’s Venezuela strategy, Fox News’ mid-December poll found Americans split on the use of deadly force against suspected drug-trafficking boats. Forty-seven percent favored it, while 53% opposed it. Trump has also played a central role in peace negotiations between Israel and Hamas, earning varied ratings across a range of different polls and questions. NBC polling in late October found registered voters about evenly split on the issue. A late December Economist/YouGov poll of adults found Trump’s approval on the issue far lower, at just one-third of adults, but a quarter of respondents said they weren’t sure. The varied responses suggest Americans are still making up their minds about the ceasefire in Israel’s military campaign in the Gaza Strip and the U.S. role in it. That same Economist/YouGov poll found Trump with low marks on his handling of the war between Russia and Ukraine: 31% approving and 49% disapproving. Fifty-three percent want America to either increase military aid to Ukraine or maintain the same amount, while 27% want to decrease or stop military aid to the country. New polling also shows Americans skeptical about Trump’s push to buy Greenland — and clearly against seizing it with military force. Other issues Health care is looming as a potentially major issue in this year’s midterms. Congress has failed to reach a deal on extending insurance subsidies for plans purchased via Affordable Care Act exchanges, causing premiums to increase for millions of people. And the White House has signaled that the administration also sees health care as a top issue, with Trump rolling out his own plan last week that proposed shifting subsidies from insurers to consumers. Polling has shown Americans broadly disapprove of how Trump has handled the issue. A Fox News poll from late December found his health care approval rating at 37% among registered voters, with 20% saying Trump should pay more attention to the issue, second only to high prices. Trump’s poll numbers over the last year have been buoyed by persistent backing from core supporters, including those who identify themselves as members of the “Make America Great Again” movement. But one of the few exceptions has been Trump’s handling of the files related to the investigation into the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, with the issue causing rare breaks from Trump among some Republicans in Congress. In the most recent NBC News Decision Desk Poll, 71% of Americans, including 27% of MAGA supporters, disapproved of Trump’s handling of the issue. There are also some broader signals of discomfort with Trump’s agenda. The Wall Street Journal poll found that 48% of registered voters said Trump is “using the office for personal gain beyond what other politicians do,” and another 13% said he’s using the office for personal gain “as much as any other politician.” Thirty-five percent said he isn’t using his office for personal gain. And the recent CNN poll found that a majority of adults said Trump has gone too far on things like his changes to the Kennedy Center and the Smithsonian, trying to “expand America’s power over other countries,” his use of executive and military power, and cutting government programs.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/trumps-approval-rating-takes-hit-first-year-back-office-rcna253192","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/260109-trump-rs-43680d.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-20 16:58:00","author":"Ben Kamisar,Bridget Bowman","authors":["Ben Kamisar","Bridget Bowman"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.183},{"id":394686562,"title":"Black Stars Who Have, Um, Disappointed Us Big Time","text":"When you reach celebrity status, everything you do is inspected under a microscope. And while in many cases, our Black stars face unjust scrutiny, a lot of them have it coming more times than we can count. \n\nWe’re not talking about folks who no longer make good music; we’re also not discussing people who have changed their appearances over time. This list is strictly for the Black entertainers, politicians and church leaders who have disappointed us big time in harmful ways. From Bishop Eddie Long’s sex abuse scandal to Nicki Minaj turning MAGA in real time, here’s a list of celebrities who have forced the Black community to take a serious and heartfelt look at their legacies and contributions to society. \n\nBen Carson rose to prominence after being the first surgeon to conjoined twins in 1987. Then, the Black man was a hero in the Black community, with millions of kids aspiring to be like him. Over the next few decades, Carson remained a pillar in the Black community, so when he launched a presidential bid in 2015 against President Donald Trump, Black folks– who generally vote Democrat– were a little confused but supportive. \n\nBut more than just running as a Republican, Carson’s failed presidential campaign landed him in good graces with Trump, who eventually named him the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development in 2017. Now, the Black community see Carson as a sellout, who chose Trump and MAGA over the plight of Black America. \n\nLeBron James\n\nSince the beginning of NBA legend LeBron James’ career, he’s had the full support of the Black community. Not only has he proven himself to be a sports icon his commitment to Black issues certainly added extra points in many Black folks’ mind. \n\nJames’ knack for politics even caught the attention of right-wing commentators who told him to “shut up and dribble” for criticizing President Donald Trump in 2018. Fast forward to now, and James is facing critiques from Black people who are disappointed in his alleged shift from Black issues.\n\nMost recently, James has been dragged over a recent Nike collaboration honoring MLK Day. The shoes– called “Honor the King–” are modeled after the Lorraine Motel where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated. \n\nAfter years of allegations, conspiracies, a messy trial and a 50 Cent documentary, it’s safe to say that the Black community is sick of Sean “Diddy” Combs. The disgraced hip-hop mogul fell from grace after dozens of lawsuits and a federal case landed him in prison for prostitution. \n\nWe previously told you his ex-girlfriend and singer, Cassie Ventura first sued Diddy alleging he abused her for years. He settled the lawsuit within 48 hours. this, of course snowballed into tons of lawsuits from Diddy’s previous girlfriends, employees and colleagues all accusing Diddy of sexual and physical abuse. Even after being found guilty last July, the rapper still faces several lawsuits. \n\nStephen A. Smith\n\nOver the last few months, sports commentator Stephen A. Smith has been facing criticism for his political takes. Smith’s controversial takes on former Vice President Kamala Harris and the entire Democratic party already had Black Americans giving side eyes. If you’ll remember, folks dragged Smith admitted to regretting his vote for VP Harris. He has also been critical of Texas Rep. Jasmine Crockett, we previously told you. \n\nWidely speaking, Smith is one of the leading voices in Black media, so Black Americans want him to be responsible with his platform. Too often, however, he misses the mark. Still, Smith’s legacy in sports and within the Black community matters.\n\nNicki Minaj\n\nNicki Minaj has been rubbing folks the wrong way since she stepped into the rap game. In 2010, she was criticized for not giving the proper respect and flowers to her idols. Fast forward to recent years when she’s been accusing newer female rappers like Megan Thee Stallion, Latto and Cardi B of not properly respecting her. \n\nBut outside of the rap beefs, Minaj has doubled down on her support for President Trump and his MAGA movement. We previously told you all about her December appearance with Erika Kirk and Turning Point USA. The rapper also raised flags after praising Trump’s handling of the Christian genocide in Nigeria– which experts say doesn’t exist. Her shocking and disappointing behavior has even resulting in a global petition to deport her. It has over 61,000 signatures. \n\nCompleting the Young Money trio is Lil Wayne, who also finds himself on this list for shading remarks he’s made in the past. In 2016, he denounced the Black Lives Matter movement saying he doesn’t feel connected to BLM at all. He called the movement “weird” before adding his status as a rich Black man absolves him from racism altogether. \n\nFast forward to 2020 and Wayne met with President Trump to discuss criminal justice reform and the Black community’s needs. Critics saw Wayne’s meeting as a betrayal, especially since the president previously made harmful comments about Black people. In 2021, Trump pardoned Lil Wayne, who was facing a 10-year bid. \n\nNo one could’ve predicted that the same person who gave us “Graduation” in 2007 is the same one spewing anti-Black, antisemitic and pro-nazi rhetoric. Kanye West has arguably damaged his legacy with years of his “slavery was a choice” comment and MAGA hat-wearing behavior. \n\nLast year, the “Jesus Walks” rapper tweeted calling himself a “nazi,” expressing his love for Adolf Hitler. Ye also confirmed he does have “DOMINION” over his wife, Bianca Censori, and even went as far as to beg President Trump to free Diddy while he was awaiting trial for sex trafficking.\n\nWhen singer R. Kelly was arrested on sex trafficking charges, the Black community was split. On one hand, the allegations– including sex abuse against minors and prostitution— against the “I Believe I Can Fly” singer was horrific and unimaginable. But on the other, Kelly’s dark secrets were already on display decades before.\n\nLegal documents show Kelly married singer Aaliyah in 1994– 25 years before he was arrest for sexual abuse. The singer was also sued by multiple women alleging underage sex and abuse by Kelly. His 30-year prison sentence was the culmination of decades of accusations and video evidence, which all equals huge disappointment from Black folks everywhere. \n\nStill, Kelly maintains a small and dedicated fanbase, and there’s a huge possibility you’ll hear “Ignition (Remix)” or “Step in the Name of Love” at somebody’s function. \n\nBishop Eddie Long\n\nThe shocking case of Bishop Eddie Long rocked the Atlanta community in 2010. Long had grown New Baptist Church in the city from a congregation of 300 to a whopping 25,000. He’d built a strong reputation nationally as a powerful and trustworthy faith leader… Until he was accused of sexual abuse by four young men. \n\nThe accusers– Spencer LaGrande, Jamal Parris, Maurice Robinson and Anthony Flagg– each filed civil lawsuits accusing Long of using his position in the church to coerce them into sexual acts, NPR reported. In 2011, Long settled the lawsuits for an undisclosed amount. He never admitted to any wrongdoing. Still, his reputation in the Black Church and greater Atlanta community was virtually destroyed. \n\nHe died in 2017.\n\nRaven-Symone\n\nWe’d be remiss to not acknowledge that compared to several others on this list, actress Raven-Symone is a star student. However, we can’t let her past comments slide!\n\nIn 2015, the “Cheetah Girls” star suggested she wouldn’t hire someone with a “Black name” like “Watermelondrea” during an episode on “The View.” The comment, while meant to be a realistic view on job discrimination– according to her at least– came off as racist and anti-Black. Folks rightfully called the actress out for having an “ethnic” name herself.\n\nThe year before that, she had already caught heat for declaring she’s not African American. “I am an American. I am not an African American,” Raven-Symone told Oprah Winfrey in 2014. The remarks sparked outrage from Black folks accusing her of denouncing her Black roots. \n\nThe actress clarified 10 years later saying, “When I say that African American does not align with me, that label, it doesn’t mean that I’m negating my Blackness or I’m not Black.” She continued, “It means I am from this country, I was born here, my mom, my dad, my great-great-great-great-great — and that’s what I’m saying. The pure logistics of it,” she explained.\n\nMarvin Sapp\n\nAll the mess surrounding Gospel star Marvin Sapp began when he spoke to a crowd of about 2,000 church goers. We previously told you, Sapp repeatedly asked folks in the crowd and viewers watching through livestream to “sow a seed” of $20, but what really caught people off guard is when he told ushers to close the doors to the congregation while they collect the money– which better equal $40,000.\n\nAfter the backlash, Sapp responded, “To those unfamiliar with the church context or who may not regularly attend worship gatherings this has been misinterpreted as holding people hostage as well as offensive. That was never my intent,” Sapp said. He went on to explain donating money in a church setting is often a “vulnerable” time for folks and almost “risky,” which is why so many people were disappointed by the way Sapp allegedly abused the sacredness of the space. \n\nKeke Palmer\n\nMuch like Raven-Symone, actress Keke Palmer is still well-loved in the Black community… But she sure is pushing it. Palmer has been facing backlash for recently collaborating with Black celebrities facing shocking abuse allegations, we told you. Considering that the child star has been open about her own domestic abuse, many Black people continue to call out the “Bottoms Up” singer for platforming folks like rapper Blueface and actor Jonathan Majors.\n\nBefore that, Palmer also was criticized for professing her love and adoration for R. Kelly in the midst of the criminal allegations against him. Still, Palmer continues to be a leading voice in the entertainment industry, which means Black folks will continue to cheer her on!\n\nIf anyone had a bad year in 2024, it was certainly Drake. When Kendrick Lamar– and most of the hip-hop community– challenged the Canadian to a rap battle, many expected Drake to dominate, citing past beefs with Pusha T and Meek Mill. Instead, Lamar dropped “Not Like Us” and silenced any opinions on who the better rapper is. \n\nBefore K. Dot dropped the song of the summer, all of his diss tracks aimed at Drake called the “God’s Plan” rapper for cultural appropriation, disloyalty, being a bad father and even disrespecting past musical icons. After having the entire world scream “A minorrrrrrrr” for all of 2024, Lamar won five Grammys and performed at the Super Bowl… Ouch, that had to hurt Drake. \n\nSo yes, the Black community is disappointed to Drake and very proud of Kendrick Lamar. Still, the 6 God isn’t known for staying down too long. He later dropped “Nokia,” a club favorite proving he is still on top of the Billboard charts. \n\nWe previously reported on Snoop Dogg responded to critics after he performed at the 2025 Crypto Ball, an event celebrating Trump’s inauguration. Snoop responded to the outrage saying, “For all that hate, I’m going to answer with love. Y’all can’t hate enough on me. I love too much. Get your life right, stop worrying about mine. I’m cool, I’m together. Still a Black man, still 100 percent Black.”\n\nStill, folks were disappointed in his flippant attitude and refusal to address Trump’s hurtful comments against his community. \n\nLike Snoop, Nelly caught flak after performing at the 2025 Crypto Ball. Nelly responded to the criticsm by doublign down on his choice. “This is not me telling you, ‘Yo, you should vote for this candidate.’ I think you should do your homework and figure out what best helps you and the people who you love and you provide for because I’m clueless on a lot of things when it gets down to it,” he said.\n\nIn 2018, years of accusations against TV dad Bill Cosby came to a head when he was convicted of assaulting Andrea Constand, but that conviction was overturned in 2021 by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. In 2022, a jury also found him responsible for sexually abusing Judy Huth in the ’70s. She was awarded $500,000. Cosby maintains his innocence, but like others on this list, his reputation and respect in the Black community was surely damaged after he was sent to prison. \n\nMichael Jordan\n\nNBA legend Michael Jordan has never been a political guy. In fact, that’s partially why he made this list. He has a long history of staying silent on racial issues, even when directly asked. In the ’90s, Jordan rubbed Black folks the wrong way when he dropped a “Republicans buy sneakers, too” advertisement while also refusing to endorse a Black political candidate.\n\nIn recent years, he’s changed a little bit, however. Jordan condemned racism and even pledged $100 million to Black organizations citing police brutality issues.","summary":"While celebrities like Ben Carson, Drake and Keke Palmer have contributed greatly to the Black community, they've also disappointed us beyond belief. \n\nRead more...","url":"https://www.theroot.com/black-stars-who-have-um-disappointed-us-big-time-2000085292","image":"https://assets-server.theroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/20161528/GettyImages-2246707190-300x200.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-20 16:46:34","author":"Phenix S Halley","authors":["Phenix S Halley"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.076},{"id":394582834,"title":"Steven Bartlett says using AI in this way is the most important thing he's done for his business","text":"Steven Bartlett said one use of AI has mattered more to his business than anything else: translating his podcast into other languages.\"There&apos;s nothing more important than what we&apos;ve done for our business than translations.

One of those laws has been challenged, and the U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments today. In Wolford v. Lopez, the state’s ban on open carry on private property that serves the public, such as a grocery store, without “express authorization” is being challenged as an infringement on residents’ Second Amendment rights. The Court’s Bruen decision in 2022 ruled that the right to bear arms includes bringing “a handgun for self-defense outside the home.” It would appear that Hawaii’s law is in direct conflict with the Bruen decision and is an underhanded effort to block Hawaiians from exercising their 2A rights.\nUnaffirming affirmative action: The attorneys general for Florida and Texas both issued opinions on Martin Luther King Jr. Day that, in keeping with Dr. King’s dream, forbid affirmative action and DEI policies in their states. Florida AG James Uthemeier commented that racial discrimination is morally wrong and unconstitutional, “Yet Florida maintains several laws on its books that promote and require discrimination on its face.” Some Florida laws that Uthemeier seeks to challenge require minority quotas on boards, councils, and in government contracts. In Texas, park locations, clean energy funds, and water projects approved in part due to affirmative action policies are likely to be reconsidered.

On Monday, Judge Jia Cobb rejected Democrats’ challenge to the new rule and agreed with DHS Secretary Kristi Noem’s argument that the agency needs to be informed of a lawmaker’s planned facility visit to ensure the “adequate protection” of the lawmaker and ICE personnel. Cobb also noted that the passage of last summer’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act created an independent revenue stream for ICE and notably did not include a guaranteed access language tied to the funding.\n\nSpeaker Johnson addresses Parliament: For the first time in its 250-year history, the speaker of the House of Representatives addressed the Parliament of London, which has existed in some form for over 700 years. Johnson spoke favorably of the “special relationship” between the U.S. and the UK, noting that “our nations have evolved and grown and strengthened in so many ways together.” Lindsay Hoyle, speaker of the British House of Commons, introduced Johnson, joking, “We’ve only just about forgiven you” for the first trade dispute between the two nations, the Boston Tea Party, “so I’ll say no more about any others,” obliquely referencing the far less friendly tone of the U.S. president. Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance have harshly criticized the UK in recent days, but hopefully, Johnson’s visit can soothe some troubled waters.\nTeachers union leaders support Maduro and communism: The Chicago Teachers Union is, as the name implies, a group meant to support public school teachers in the Chicago area, so readers can probably guess what it was up to in early January. That’s right — leading an emergency protest in concert with other socialist groups to oppose Operation Absolute Resolve, where the U.S. captured the illegitimate leader of Venezuela. To understand how this took place, it is useful to examine CTU’s executive board, which includes one member, Kobi Guillory, who also serves on the Freedom Road Socialist Organization’s central committee. The FRSO issued public statements in support of Maduro’s regime and has wished for terrorist organizations to experience “success upon success.” While conservatives are unlikely to be surprised by a strong link between teachers unions and radical Marxists, their brazen connections can still come as a shock.\nVenezuelans are appreciative of Maduro’s extradition: A local Venezuelan polling firm asked 1,006 Venezuelans about their feelings on Operation Absolute Resolve and the capture of their illegitimate president, Nicolás Maduro. American leftists may be surprised to learn that 92.2% of respondents said they were grateful to President Trump for his stunning action, while only 6.3% said otherwise. Venezuelans aren’t limiting their gratitude to the commander-in-chief either. When asked if they agreed with the U.S. “becoming the principal ally and only provider of products for the Venezuelan state,” 90.6% said yes. Americans have been so insulated from tyranny for so long that they struggle to understand some basic facts, but as it turns out, human beings are usually grateful when their oppressors are killed or captured.\nWhat is a woman? Dems won’t say: Of nearly 20 potential Democrat 2028 presidential contenders, only one knows what a woman is. Axios recently observed how these Democrats responded to the following question: “Can a man become a woman?” The list of Democrats includes Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Kamala Harris, Sen. Cory Booker, and California Gov. Gavin Newsom. The majority of these Democrats dodged the question entirely. For example, Newsom deflected, “Yeah, I just, well, I think, uh, for the grace of God.” The lone Democrat who didn’t go all mealy-mouthed and weak-kneed was former Obama White House Chief of Staff and former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, whose answer was simply, “No.” This issue continues to be a major weakness for Democrats because they are afraid of crossing the LGBT contingent of their base.\n\nSanders snubs Holocaust Museum board meetings: Bernie Sanders, who’s as Jewish as a ham sandwich and has falsely accused Israel of committing genocide, has not attended one meeting of the Holocaust Memorial Council in the 18 years since his appointment. Congress established the Council in 1980, requiring 55 members to be presidentially appointed to five-year terms, with an additional 10 members coming from the House and the Senate. Two Trump-appointed members are among a dozen others who have signed a letter requesting that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer replace Sanders, whose “beliefs and public statements do not reflect the stated mission of the museum.” The letter states, “With Jew hatred and Holocaust distortion rising globally, it is imperative that Senate-appointed representatives on the Council are fully engaged and steadfastly supportive of its mission.” It’s probably best practice to have someone on the Holocaust Council who doesn’t hate Israel.\nChina’s birthrate continues to plummet: China’s 1979 one-child policy continues to threaten the future of the world’s largest communist country. Despite ending the policy in 2015, the birthrate of the East Asian nation is in a continuous free fall. Last year, China saw a total of 7.92 million babies born while experiencing 11.31 million deaths. This continues a trend of falling birth rates, now at a record low of 5.63 births per 1,000 people, down from 6.4 births per 1,000 two years prior. The population “replacement level” is 2.1 births per woman. China has not only dropped below two births per woman but is now below one birth per woman. If this trend doesn’t turn around soon, China’s future is doomed. However, China is far from the only country struggling with declining birth rates, as the U.S. is currently at 1.6 births per woman.\n\nTeam Kamala asked if Josh Shapiro was an Israeli double agent (Hot Air)\nKremlin says Trump has invited Putin to join “Board of Peace” for Gaza (Not the Bee)\nCanada-China trade deal poses national security threat to U.S. (Washington Stand)\nHumor: ICE protesters reveal next nine places they will attack (Babylon Bee)\n\nThe Executive News Summary is compiled daily by Jordan Candler, Thomas Gallatin, Sterling Henry, and Sophie Starkova.

On Sunday, Don Lemon and a bunch of anti-ICE rabble-rousers invaded a church during a worship service because they allegedly thought there was a connection between the church and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. On Monday, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced that the Trump administration has apprehended quite a few aliens in Minnesota.\n\nIn other words, the Land of 10,000 Somali Daycares remains at the center of the immigration universe.\n\n“PEACE AND PUBLIC SAFETY IN MINNEAPOLIS!” Noem posted on X. “We have arrested over 10,000 criminal illegal aliens who were killing Americans, hurting children and reigning terror in Minneapolis because Tim Walz and Jacob Frey refuse to protect their own people and instead protect criminals.”\n\nShe added, “There is MASSIVE Fraud in Minneapolis, at least $19 billion and that’s just the tip of [the] iceberg. Our Homeland Security Investigators are on the ground in Minneapolis conducting wide scale investigations to get justice for the American people who have been robbed blind. MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN.”\n\nObviously, her post goes against the grain of the Leftmedia’s reporting and public mood. If you believe the polls, Americans have quickly soured on the Trump administration’s enforcement, especially after Renee Good’s death.\n\nMinnesota, of course, was the only state Ronald Reagan didn’t win in 1984, so it’s not like its left-wing politics are something new.\n\nLet’s focus for a moment on Don Lemon, who was fired from CNN in 2023. He claims he “didn’t even know” about the mob’s plans to disrupt and effectively end the worship service at Cities Church, but he embedded with them and then entered the building with them to film their actions. They mistook the pastor, David Easterwood, for a man of the same name who is the acting director of the St. Paul ICE field office.\n\n“Listen,” Lemon insisted, “there’s a Constitution and a First Amendment to freedom of speech and freedom to assemble and protest.” His actions, he claims, were “an act of journalism.”\n\nLemon has been put “on notice” by the Justice Department’s Harmeet Dhillon, who said, “The First Amendment [does not] protect your pseudo journalism of disrupting a prayer service.”\n\nLemon also made clear what he thinks of any Christians who object to his or the mob’s behavior. “I think people who are in religious groups like that — it’s not the type of Christianity that I practice — but I think that they’re entitled, and that entitlement comes from … white supremacy,” he told leftist podcaster Jennifer Welch. “They think this country was built for them, that it’s a Christian country.”\n\nThat’s not journalism; that’s hateful bigotry and left-wing activism. That describes much of today’s Leftmedia.\n\nBut wait — here’s the funny part.\n\nLemon could face charges under the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act, which is generally a law meant to govern protests at abortion clinics. But another possibility Dhillon raised is the Ku Klux Klan Act. “The Biden DOJ used the Klan Act conspiracy charges tacked onto the FACE Act in the case of protests outside abortion clinics to bring much longer sentences,” she explained. “So there are a number of tools available to us.”\n\nThat could make Lemon even more sour.\n\nFederal law enforcement officials are in this situation because Minnesota officials refuse to enforce the law.\n\nState Attorney General Keith Ellison called the church invasion a “protest” that “is fundamental to American society.” I’m guessing that, as a Muslim, he wouldn’t say the same thing about an invasion of a mosque.\n\nIt’s bad enough that Ellison praised the illegal “protest,” but The Daily Wire reports, “A top staffer for Hennepin County’s Soros-backed prosecutor was among the protesters.” That would be Jamael Lundy, who “works as intergovernmental affairs coordinator for Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty, is married to St. Paul City Council member Anika Bowie, and is running for a seat in the state legislature as a Democrat.”\n\nSo, the state’s chief law enforcement officer and a prosecutor are part of the problem, but as I mentioned above, the resistance includes Mayor Frey and Governor Walz. After Good was shot and killed by an ICE agent because she disobeyed direct orders and accelerated her car while he stood in front of it — in other words, a justified shooting, gaslighting notwithstanding — Frey demanded that ICE “get the f**k out” of Minneapolis. Walz accused ICE of “organized brutality against the people of Minnesota.”\n\nBoth men have made numerous other inflammatory comments that debase the Rule of Law and arguably incite protesters to more radical and sometimes violent actions. Democrats know what they’re doing, which is why they throw in a “peaceful” admonition here and there. Frey even laughably asserted that the angry mob resistance “is all about love.”\n\nWhatever, dude.\n\nWalz and Frey have absolutely impeded federal law enforcement operations. Hence the DOJ subpoenas.\n\nIn fact, as our Michael Smith argues today, Democrat non-enforcement — and impeding enforcement — is why we have a veritable immigration street war.\n\nFollow Nate Jackson on X.\n\nComment | Share\n\nMORE ANALYSIS\n\nMichael Smith: How Non-Enforcement Turned Immigration Into a Street War — America didn’t stumble into immigration violence.

The request is to put Michigan’s primary in an “early window,” per a news release from the state party.\n\nWhen making the request, MDP Chair Curtis Hertel highlighted the state’s diversity. He and other elected officials also focused on Michigan’s battleground status. \n\n“For Democrats to have the strongest presidential candidate, the early nominating states should closely mirror Democratic voters nationwide and be representative of America,” Hertel said. \n\n“Michigan is the most diverse battleground state in the country and investments made on the ground early are beneficial to electing a Democratic president in the general election,” he added. “Michigan is a perfect candidate to be in the lineup of early nominating contests, and it’s crucial that our new national calendar for selecting the next president includes Michigan in an early position.”\n\nBetween four and five states will be selected for the early window this year, with one state chosen from each of the DNC’s four geographic regions: the Midwest, East, South and West. \n\nEarlier voting states typically have a bigger influence on the presidential primary choice, and the calendar affects how Democratic candidates strategize. With a wide-open field ahead of the 2028 race, Michigan’s selection would likely mean more campaign staff stationed in the state and dollars spent. \n\nIn 2020, for example, 18 states had their Democratic primary before Michigan. \n\nBy the time the state hosted its primary, many major candidates – like Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Pete Buttigieg and Cory Booker – had already dropped out. More than 100,000 votes went toward dropped-out candidates, as many voters submitted absentee ballots before their candidate backed out. \n\nMichigan was selected as an early voting state for the 2024 election, with a Feb. 27 primary date behind South Carolina on Feb. 6, New Hampshire and Nevada on Feb. 13 and Georgia on Feb. 20. \n\nTo do so, the state passed legislation in 2023 moving its presidential primary to the fourth Tuesday in February. The DNC’s rules committee requires state parties hold nominating contests after the first Tuesday in March unless they’re specifically exempted. \n\nIn 2028, that date would fall on Feb. 22, if the state is able to keep its early spot.\n\nThere are 12 states that sent a letter of interest to the DNC about going earlier, per CNN: Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia. \n\nFrom the Midwest region, Michigan is vying against Illinois and Iowa, though an extra state from one region could be chosen. \n\nThe applications to the DNC’s Rules and Bylaws Committee were due on Friday, Jan. 16, according to a new process established last year. \n\nNow, members of the committee charged with setting the calendar are expected to cut down the field of applicants at a late January meeting, according to reporting by Politico. States are expected to be invited to make presentations to the committee in the spring, and a potential calendar could be finalized near the end of summer. \n\nThe DNC named three new pillars used to evaluate early state applicants, including: \n\nRigorousness. The lineup of early states must be a “comprehensive test of candidates with diverse groups of voters that are key to winning the general election.” Fairness. The lineup of early states must be “affordable, practical for candidates and not exhaust their resources unreasonably, precluding them from effectively participating in future contests.” Efficiency. The lineup of early states must include those with the “practical ability to run a fair, transparent, and inclusive primary or caucus.” \n\nMichigan’s electeds are highlighting the state’s diversity in its application, with Gov. Gretchen Whitmer – still considered a possible 2028 presidential candidate – describing it as the most diverse battleground. \n\n“Michigan embodies all the constituencies that will be key to winning the presidency,” Whitmer said. “The middle class was built right here in Michigan, and our two biggest industries, manufacturing and agriculture, employ millions of hardworking people across our state.” \n\nU.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Ann Arbor, said the battleground state would benefit from an early Democratic investment. Dingell has been elected to the Rules and Bylaws Committee, which will make the primary calendar nominations. \n\n“A Michigan presidential primary is a down payment on the general election, giving us a head start on critical organizing efforts that pay huge dividends in November,” Dingell said. “I don’t think that any one state should have a lock on going first, but Michigan will always fight for a battleground state to be a part of the early primary process.” \n\nMichigan, considered a swing state, went red in 2024, with 49.7% of voters supporting now-President Donald Trump. \n\nState House Minority Leader Ranjeev Puri, D-Canton, highlighted how in the last five presidential elections, voters in the state have cast their ballots for the winning candidates. \n\n“An early primary in Michigan ensures Democratic nominees are tested with the voters who will ultimately decide the presidential election,” he said.","summary":"Michigan is one of 12 states competing for an early position in the 2028 Democratic presidential primary calendar.","url":"https://www.mlive.com/politics/2026/01/michigan-democrats-seek-early-voting-spot-for-2028-presidential-primary.html","image":"https://www.mlive.com/resizer/v2/RYI4ZEP3VRDXFARILTNXYYTRNA.JPG?auth=81116f9461367a5b8c196e1fc869060524ce1d66196fea0b5ef31cd61a3b8cde&width=1280&smart=true&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-20 16:22:00","author":"Danielle James","authors":["Danielle James"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.512},{"id":394572048,"title":"Josh Shapiro Reveals Anti-Israel Vetting Done By Harris VP Team","text":"Governor Josh Shapiro is spilling the tea on Kamala Harris’s vice presidential interview process, and it isn’t pretty.When Harris became the anointed nominee, she had to find a running mate quickly. Josh Shapiro was seen as the front-runner for that role due to his position as governor of Pennsylvania, a swing state, and the perception of him as a more “moderate” Democrat. At the time that she picked her vice president, it was seen as political malpractice for Kamala Harris to choose Tim Walz over Josh Shapiro. After the election, when it was obvious that the choice of Walz did not help Harris at all, she tried to explain her reasoning behind not choosing Shapiro in her “107 Days” memoir.\n\nHarris described Shapiro, one of three finalists for the post, as “poised, polished and personable.” But she was put off by his ambition — and his request to be in the room for every major decision — and worried he would not settle for the number-two job.Harris twice describes Shapiro as “peppering” her and staff with questions, not just about details of the job but also life as vice president. He asked the residence manager a number of questions about the home, ranging from the number of bedrooms to “how he might arrange to get Pennsylvania artists’ work on loan from the Smithsonian.”She also accused Shapiro of exhibiting a “lack of discretion” in the veepstakes, recalling that his official vehicles with Pennsylvania plates were filmed by CNN in front of the vice president’s residence, despite efforts by her staff to arrange for less attention-getting transportation.\n\nJosh Shapiro was plenty mad at Harris for this characterization of him.","url":"https://hotair.com/headlines/2026/01/20/josh-shapiro-reveals-anti-israel-vetting-done-by-harris-vp-team-n3810988","image":null,"video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-20 15:00:00","author":"Beege Welborn","authors":["Beege Welborn"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.425},{"id":394588852,"title":"Michelle Obama Said Something Really Racist Again","text":"Michelle Obama has once again demonstrated she’s a racist.

She’s not just saying she tries to buy from black designers; she suggests everyone else should be concerned about the race of the designer whose clothes they’re wearing. Imagine going clothes shopping and, instead of deciding what to buy based on your style, you’re on your phone trying to figure out whether the brand is black-owned or whether the designer is black.\n\nImagine for a second if First Lady Melania Trump had sat down for an interview and announced that she makes it a point to support white designers. The media firestorm would be instant and relentless. But what Michelle Obama said. I can’t even find a mainstream media article on her comments. That's the double standard in action. By the left's own rules about what counts as racist, Obama's comment fits the bill perfectly — except for the fact that discriminating against white people doesn't count.\n\nRecommended: HA HA! Don Lemon May Be Charged Under the Ku Klux Klan Act\n\nThis is far from the first time Obama has said something that crosses racial lines. In her book, she claimed that \"as the first black couple\" in the White House, the Obamas \"couldn't afford any missteps\" and that as a black woman, \"I was under a particularly white hot glare.\" She explained to ABC's Robin Roberts, \"You can't afford to get anything wrong because you didn't get the grace that I think some other families have gotten.\" The implication was clear: white first families got a pass for being white, but the Obamas had to be perfect.\n\nIn other words, America is racist.\n\nThen there was her conversation with Tracee Ellis Ross about hair and beauty standards. Michelle really let loose in that one.\n\n\"Let me explain something to white people,\" she began, already setting a tone that would be unthinkable if the races were reversed. \"Our hair comes out of our head naturally in a curly pattern, so when we're straightening it to follow your beauty standards, we are trapped by the straightness. That's why so many of us can't swim... and we run away from the water. People won't go to the gym... because we're trying to keep our hair straight for y'all.\" She added that \"it is exhausting and it's so expensive and it takes up so much time,\" before declaring, \"Why do we need an act, a law to tell white folks to get outta our hair? Don't tell me how to wear my hair. Don't wonder about it. Don't touch it. Just don't.\"\n\nThe whole rant was dripping with resentment toward white people, as if we're sitting around obsessing over black hairstyles, when in reality we couldn’t care less.

The demonstration, aimed at disrupting normal activities, focused on condemning the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and a fatal shooting by an ICE officer in Minneapolis.\n\nOn Sunday, anti-ICE protestors entered Cities Church, searching for David Easterwood, whom they identified as the acting director of the St. Paul ICE office. Although Easterwood was not present, demonstrators chanted slogans demanding “Justice for Renee Good,” and calling for Easterwood’s resignation, alongside other anti-ICE messages.\n\nThe protests were fueled by the January 7 incident where ICE officer Jonathan Ross fatally shot Renee Good, an event captured on video and widely viewed across the nation. The shooting sparked significant outrage, especially among left-leaning groups and independents. Meanwhile, the Trump administration and its supporters labeled Good as a “domestic terrorist,” claiming her actions justified the shooting.\n\nDespite Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche’s recent statement that the DOJ is not investigating the officer involved, President Donald Trump has threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act to deploy military forces, a measure he considered during the 2020 protests following the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer.\n\nA video livestreamed by Black Lives Matter Minnesota showed activists interrupting the church service and confronting the attending pastor, Jonathan Parnell, accusing him and the congregation of being “fake Christians.” Don Lemon, who was present at the scene, conducted interviews with Parnell and documented the unfolding events.\n\nAlso inside the church — and recording the action — was Lemon, who interviewed Parnell.\n\nAfter Parnell said it was “shameful to interrupt a public gathering of Christians in worship,” Lemon countered that there’s a “Constitution and a First Amendment and freedom of speech to assemble and protest.”\n\n“We’re here to worship Jesus,” Parnell responded, referring to his and the congregation’s own First Amendment right.\n\nIn Lemon’s post on his Bluesky account, he can be seen outside the church speaking with activist, reverend, and lawyer Nekima Levy Armstrong, a protest organizer, asking her to “tell us why you’re doing this.”\n\n“We show up somewhere that is a key location — they don’t expect us to come there — and then we disrupt business as usual,” explained Armstrong, who heads the Racial Justice Network. She called the protest a “clandestine operation” and also “part of our duty as Christians” to expose the hypocrisy of church leaders, referring to Easterwood.\n\nLemon separately acknowledged that after some “reconnaissance on the ground” in Minneapolis, he became aware of “Operation Pull Up,” and noted that Armstrong has been “doing this since George Floyd, Daunte Wright, and others, where they surprise people, catch them off guard and hold them to account.” Lemon added that these were “surprise operations” and that he “can’t tell you where they’re going.”\n\nLater in the same video, Lemon spoke with Armstrong inside the church, and she explained the purpose of the disruption.\n\n“We’re demanding justice for Renee Good and letting them know that this will not stand. They cannot pretend to be a house of God while harboring someone who is directing ICE agents to wreak havoc upon our community and who killed Renee Good,” she said. “I am a reverend, on top of being a lawyer and an activist, so I come here in the power of the almighty God.”\n\nDuring a NewsNation interview, Armstrong said “absolutely not” when asked if the protest went too far.\n\n“I’m not going to go down this line of questioning with you. This is gaslighting. Who has gone too far is Donald Trump, Kristi Noem, JD Vance, and the people who run ICE,” she said.\n\nLemon, by his own account, “followed” the protesters into the church, not knowing where they were headed, and said he engaged in “an act of journalism” from there.\n\n“That’s what protesting is about. It’s to make people uncomfortable. You may not like it,” he said.\n\nIn yet another video, Lemon wondered how he became the face of the story unfolding in Minnesota. Lemon said he realized he was the “biggest name there,” but that his producers also reminded him, “Don, you’re a gay Black man in America.”\n\nHigh-ranking DOJ lawyers have specifically raised the possibility of investigating Lemon for possible violations of the Ku Klux Klan Act and at least one other statute — the same law that the Biden administration used to prosecute abortion clinic blockades by anti-abortion activists, each of whom was subsequently pardoned by Trump.\n\nThe DOJ Civil Rights Division’s Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon suggested as much in an interview with conservative podcaster Benny Johnson on his eponymous show, mentioning Lemon by name while discussing at length the KKK Act — which Trump himself was civilly accused of violating on Jan. 6 — and the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act.\n\nBREAKING: DOJ Announces Intention to Charge Don Lemon under the Ku Klux Klan Act.\nThe KKK Act makes it illegal to threaten, hurt, or intimidate people to prevent them from exercising their God-given rights.\nHARMEET DHILLON: “The Klan Act is one of the most important federal… pic.twitter.com/GWnXAMtWc9\n— Benny Johnson (@bennyjohnson) January 19, 2026\n\nThe FACE Act, in addition to barring interference with access to “reproductive health services,” prohibits “intentionally injuring, intimidating, or interfering with, or attempting to injure, intimidate, or interfere, any person by force, threat of force, or physical obstruction exercising or seeking to exercise the First Amendment right of religious freedom at a place of religious worship[.]”\n\nDhillon, vowing that “we will pursue charges in this case,” stated that she sees “various crimes that have occurred, exactly what they are I’m not going to flag, but the FACE Act has been mentioned as one of the predicates there.” She also contemplated conspiracy and other charges stemming from a “use of the wires or the mails,” which suggests a potential look at the protest’s organizers.\n\n“In other cases, the Biden DOJ used the Klan Act conspiracy charges tacked on to the FACE Act in the case of protests outside of abortion clinics, to bring much longer sentences, so there are a number of tools available to us,” the AAG added, before posing a series of questions. “Who funded this? What other crimes may have occurred? Was there a use of the wires or the mails in preparing for this event? Did anyone cross state lines to do this? All of those are potential predicates for additional federal charges.”\n\nJohnson followed up by asking more about the KKK Act, saying it was the first time he’d heard that mentioned in the aftermath of the church protest.\n\n“The Klan Act is one of the most important federal civil rights statutes, and it goes back to the time when President Lincoln emancipated the slaves, and yet the Southern States — Dixiecrats, mainly — were refusing to give them equal rights,” Dhillon responded. “In fact, you had sheriffs and you had law enforcement harassing the newly freed slaves.”\n\n“So the Klan Act is a law that makes it illegal to terrorize citizens to violate their civil rights, to get together and conspire to violate the civil rights it is often used against law enforcement but is now used against others as well,” she said.\n\n“What the Biden administration did is if three grandmas got together to pray outside an abortion clinic for the souls of the people inside and including unborn children, they would say ‘Oh, that’s not just a violation of the Klan Act, that’s a conspiracy to violate the civil rights of women going in there to get abortions, and so we’re going to add additional charges and punish that more, and make it from a misdemeanor under the FACE Act to a felony under the Klan Act,’” Dhillon continued.\n\nThe AAG then named Lemon as a potential “embedded part of a criminal conspiracy,” rather than a First Amendment-shielded individual “committing journalism.”\n\n“This is a very serious matter. Come next Sunday, nobody should think in the United States they should be able to get away with this,” Dhillon said, perhaps a thinly veiled hint at the speed of what may come. “Everybody in the protest community needs to know that the fullest force of the federal government is going to come down and prevent this from happening, and put people away for a long, long time.”\n\nDhillon’s public statements come at a time when influential voices on the right have called for exactly what she articulated.\n\n“Today Don Lemon and a group of leftist agitators stormed a church service to protest ICE. This is a direct and flagrant violation of the FACE Act, which the Biden Administration used to throw pro-lifers in federal prison for years,” conservative commentator Matt Walsh reacted. “Don Lemon and his co-conspirators should be facing federal prison.”\n\n“I want Don Lemon dragged out of his house by a SWAT team at gun point. That’s what Biden did to pro-lifers,” Walsh added. “Time to make these scumbags play by the same rules. Force feed them a dose of their own medicine for once.”\n\nThe White House and top DOJ officials also issued public denouncements, promising investigations and possible prosecutions.\n\n“President Trump will not tolerate the intimidation and harassment of Christians in their sacred places of worship. The Department of Justice has launched a full investigation into the despicable incident that took place earlier today at a church in Minnesota,” said White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt.\n\nPresident Trump will not tolerate the intimidation and harassment of Christians in their sacred places of worship.\nThe Department of Justice has launched a full investigation into the despicable incident that took place earlier today at a church in Minnesota.\n— Karoline Leavitt (@PressSec) January 19, 2026\n\n“I just spoke to the Pastor in Minnesota whose church was targeted.

Tim Walz, Kamala Harris’ choice for vice president in the 2024 election, for allegedly trying to impede ICE’s deportation operation through their public criticisms.\n\nBondi, citing “constant communication” with Dhillon, claimed credit for issuing the “direction” to investigate the church disruption.\n\n“Any violation of federal law will be prosecuted,” Bondi vowed, with Blanche, Trump’s former criminal defense attorney, reposting the message.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nDon Lemon interviews Nekima Levy Armstrong about her intentions on Jan. 18,&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Top DOJ Official Highlights Potential KKK Act Violations by Don Lemon Amid Allegations of Protest Involvement at Church first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/crime/top-doj-official-highlights-potential-kkk-act-violations-by-don-lemon-amid-allegations-of-protest-involvement-at-church/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Put-people-away-for-a-long-long-time-Top-DOJ.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-20 14:22:22","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.058},{"id":394551384,"title":"All This and a Bag of Quips","text":"After some time and study, it’s been determined that if you don’t interfere with police actions, they tend to leave you alone.\n\n• Remember that the same boiling water that softens the potato hardens the egg.

You can’t make this stuff up.\n\n• I saw all that I needed to know about the left once it started cheering for Iran.\n\n• The same crowd that doesn’t call a fetus a baby somehow believes that a man in heels is a woman.\n\n• Interesting how the left wants ICE agents to ID themselves, but not voters.\n\n• There’s a major difference between wanting to be in America and actually being an American. Culture versus legality.\n\n• If we allow the government to decide what “truth” is, truth will be whatever the government wants you to believe, regardless of the actual facts.

Now, about Ilhan Omar marrying her brother.\n\n• Interesting how Hunter Biden isn’t on any executive boards anymore, huh?\n\n• There are a large number of folks excited by the prospect of Kamala Harris running for president again, and surprisingly enough, a few of them are Democrats.\n\n• Phone records don’t lie, but they easily prove that Fani Willis did.\n\n• It's interesting how the people who were mere weeks ago telling us they don’t believe in borders are now all concerned about the territorial integrity of Greenland.\n\n• If genitals don’t define gender, how does removing them affirm it?\n\n• It’s easily demonstrated that a vote is more deadly than a gun of any type. Yet we pass laws in an attempt to control Guns, and not who votes.\n\n• I believe the difference between now and 1972, when Joe Biden first started in politics, is best explained this way: In 1972, when you bought a car, the instruction manual told you how to adjust the brakes and the valves. These days, with Joe Biden in the rear view mirror, the manual says nothing about the brakes or the valves or, for that matter, anything technical. It does, however, instruct the driver not to drink the radiator coolant or the battery acid.\n\n• So if we made pancakes that were coffee-flavored, would they be called frappe jacks?\n\n• Interesting how liberals can’t tell us when life begins, but they can tell us with great certainty what the weather will be like in 100 years.\n\n• Greenland will cost us billions of dollars.

We can always start a daycare in Minneapolis.\n\n• I’m trying to master the art of eating a powdered doughnut without looking like I just came from the Biden White House.\n\n• I see where Jasmine Crockett’s eyelashes have been declared a national forest.\n\n• But when the dish and the spoon run away together, what happens when they come to a fork in the road?\n\n• I am thoroughly amazed that crows are not on the endangered species list, given the number of them that Democrats have been having to eat lately. \n\n• Britney Spears’ longtime manager says the singer may never perform again. Okay, ya promise?\n\n• A friend of mine says, “The whole root of the concept of 'justice' lies in bringing human action into accord with reality.” That’s true enough, and well said, but how does one explain reality to a Democrat? If recent years have shown us anything, it’s that the Democrats consider reality to be an entirely new concept.\n\n• Somewhere, in some parallel universe, there is a cat that spends all of its time putting stuff back on the shelves.\n\n• We’ve heard the pencil neck himself, Adam Schiff, saying for years now that he has evidence that there was collusion or some kind of criminal activity between Trump and his people and Russia. He’s never backed down from this, never retracted the claim. And yet, he hasn’t given it to Congress, and he hasn’t given it to any active investigation, hasn’t turned it over to the FBI, and so on. Question: Doesn’t that constitute obstruction of justice? • We have all been witnesses to middle Americans sending a devastating message to Anheuser-Busch, Target, Garth Brooks, and a number of other people, all without burning them to the ground, and then taking off with everything we can carry. Sad to see Democrats haven’t got that one down yet.\n\n• When are we going to recognize that so-called anti- discrimination policies are in fact pro- discrimination policies?\n\n• China couldn’t care less about its contribution to “global warming,” because they themselves already HAVE a communist government.

Just letting you know so you can praise me for my incredible bravery.\n\n• I’m old enough to remember when Democrats seemed proud to claim that they were anti-communist.

The year was also largely eventful as Google, Apple, ChatGPT-maker OpenAI and Meta, among others announced billion in spending and generated revenues, riding the AI wave. It also saw a remarkable increase in personal wealth of multiple tech leaders, including Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos.Elon Musk wealth increased by roughly $234 billion under Trump 2.0According to a list completed by The Financial Times, Elon Musk accumulated multi-billions under Trump’s second term despite a mid-year fallout over his leadership of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). SpaceX continues to dominate federal contracts and the Pentagon recently integrated his Grok AI model into its operations.Sam Altman's OpenAI gets multi-billion dollar contracts and investmentsSam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, appeared to execute a total political pivot. From once calling Trump’s 2016 win the “worst thing” of his life, Altman spent 2025 standing alongside the President to announce a $500 billion data centre initiative. The company’s valuation soared from $157 billion in late 2024 to $500 billion in 2025.Apple Tim Cook announces billions of dollars spendingUnder Tim Cook’s leadership, Apple announced a total of $600 billion investment over the course of 4 years. He also famously defused ‘fentanyl tariff’ tensions by presenting Trump with a gold trophy. Apple shares are up almost 15% since Trump’s inauguration, and Cook owns 3.3 million of them.Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’ ’damage control’Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’ focused on \"damage control\" to protect their supply chains and logistics networks by taking a more cultural approach. First he reportedly ‘killed’ a Washington Post endorsement of Kamala Harris. The move appears to have worked as Bezos’s Blue Origin has largely avoided the administration's ire. Under Trump 2.0, Bezos accumulated roughly $15 billion wealth.Mark Zuckerberg's multiple Mar-a-Lago visitsMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg began the year with personal threats from the President but massive infrastructure pledges got them back into the administration’s good books. In 2025, Zuckerberg overtook Bezos to become the world’s third-wealthiest person in July/ August with roughly $1.9 billion wealth surge. He also appointed Trump ally Dina Powell McCormick as Meta’s President and pledged $600 billion in US investment.Google CEO Sundar Pichai settled lawsuitGoogle and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai also started 2025 in a similar fashion as Mark Zuckerberg but triple-downed inaugural donations (giving $1 million). The company settled a censorship lawsuit under Trump 2.0 which boosted investors confidence, leading to a surge in company’s valuation and becoming second most valuable company by year-end.

After it was over, according to the New York Times, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Dokoupil and his team, \"He said, 'Make sure you guys don’t cut the tape, make sure the interview is out in full,'\" and also, \"He said, ‘If it’s not out in full, we’ll sue your ass off.’”\n\nCBS News said in a statement obtained by the Times that it had always planned to air the entire interview without any edits.\n\nIt wasn’t the only communication to generate buzz during Trump’s trip to Detroit.

He pardoned hundreds of violent domestic terrorists who had assaulted police officers to advance his Jan. 6, 2021, coup attempt. He cut programs already funded by Congress and spent money on things for which they had not. He defied federal judges. He declared he had the authority to kill suspected drug smugglers on the high seas and then to attack a foreign country, without congressional approval, to capture its dictator. And most recently, he has deployed a de facto secret police force in military gear, answerable only to him, in a city where he is broadly despised. One 37-year-old mother and American citizen is already dead, shot in the head following a dispute with immigration agents.\n\nSteven Levitsky, a Harvard professor of government and co-author of 2018’s “How Democracies Die,” said he did not foresee how quickly Trump would move.\n\n“It’s been a little bit more aggressive than I anticipated,” he said, adding that he and a colleague who published an article a year ago previewing Trump’s return were especially taken aback by his readiness to use deadly force against Americans through agencies like Immigration and Customs Enforcement. “We didn’t anticipate the deployment of ICE as a violent paramilitary arm of the state.”\n\nTrump’s staff deny that he is an autocrat. When asked to comment for this story, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson called the inquiry “deeply unserious” and evidence of “Trump Derangement Syndrome.”\n\nTrump himself has instead turned the suggestion that he is an autocrat on its head, and accused his critics and Democrats of undermining democracy. “Because the fact is, I am not a threat to democracy, they are,” he said at a rally in September 2024.\n\nThat formulation worked for him during that election, as exit polls showed that while American democracy was a top issue, Trump supporters believed it was he, despite Jan. 6, who would be better for the continuation of the republic.\n\nThat view may be shifting, with new polls showing that most Americans do not support his military adventurism ― threatening to take Greenland by force, for example ― or the way ICE is behaving.\n\n“The secret police created by Trump and DHS and funded exuberantly by Congress are far more diabolical than anyone imagined,” said Ty Cobb, a lawyer in Trump’s first-term White House. “Masks, suppressors, mistakenly perceived immunity and license to kill American citizens. Just dystopian.”\n\nRobert Kagan, a neoconservative scholar who worked in the Reagan administration, made what was considered by many at the time an outlandish prediction when he wrote in late 2023 that a Trump dictatorship was the most likely outcome if he returned to power.\n\nToday, he says Americans, even as polls show their support for Trump falling, still are not alarmed enough.\n\n“Everybody has to understand that he is not going to allow the Democrats to take power in the 2026 elections. We’re 10 months away from the end of elections,” Kagan warned. “If I’m getting credit for predictions, that’s the prediction I’m making.”\n\nAutocracy promised, autocracy delivered\n\nEven during his first run for the White House in 2016, many Americans, including a significant percentage of “mainstream” Republicans, grew alarmed by his demagoguery and embrace of violence. No less than JD Vance, now Trump’s vice president but at the time working at a venture capital firm, confided to a friend that Trump could well be “America’s Hitler.”\n\nAfter Trump won and took office in 2017, the autocratic declarations continued, although were often ignored by many Americans because then-Vice President Mike Pence and most of Trump’s top advisers and Cabinet members, who were largely mainstream Republicans, either talked him out of his plans or ignored him, knowing that his short attention span meant he was likely to forget.\n\nTrump spoke about acquiring Greenland in his first term, too, but as a purchase. When Denmark made clear it had no interest in selling the territory and with most of his advisers stressing the importance of the NATO alliance, that was the end of it. Trump also spoke of shooting protesters and illegal border-crossers, but his first-term military advisers told him that doing so was illegal, and they would not comply.\n\nThe confidence among his aides that his autocratic excesses could be contained, however, grew less certain as the years passed, and then disappeared entirely when he lost reelection in 2020 and spent the next two months plotting to remain in power regardless. His efforts resulted in the Jan. 6, 2021, violent assault on the Capitol.\n\nMany Republicans, including then-Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell, believed Trump had been chastened by the uniform condemnation of his actions and that, in any event, he was finished politically.\n\nTrump, though, never showed the slightest remorse for inciting the attack that injured 140 police officers and led to the deaths of five. Indeed, as federal prosecutors ramped up an investigation into his actions leading up to and on that day, Trump began claiming that it was being done solely to prevent him from returning to office.\n\nWith the complicity of many Republicans who feared his followers and a news media eager for access and willing to downplay Jan. 6 in return, Trump just 2 1/2 years after having left the White House in disgrace had become the front-runner to win his party’s nomination.\n\nIt was then that Kagan published a lengthy, detailed essay warning that Trump was likely to win the presidency and then make himself a dictator. Two years later, the piece proves remarkably prescient, predicting step by step how Trump would win back the White House and how he would behave once there.\n\n“Let’s stop the wishful thinking and face the stark reality: There is a clear path to dictatorship in the United States, and it is getting shorter every day,” Kagan wrote.\n\nAs Kagan foresaw, Trump has, in fact, used the excuse of the criminal investigations into his own actual conduct to turn the Justice Department into his personal attack dog, launching criminal probes into his former FBI director, the attorney general of New York, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, lawmakers who taped a video urging members of the military not to follow illegal orders and, most recently, elected leaders in Minnesota who oppose his deployment of ICE there.\n\nWith a sycophantic defense secretary unwilling to tell him what he is not allowed to do, Trump has summarily killed more than a hundred alleged drug smugglers on small boats in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific without even a formal criminal accusation, let alone a trial. He similarly attacked the capital of Venezuela to capture its dictator ― another supposed “law enforcement” exercise but which nonetheless killed dozens of people, both Nicolás Maduro’s security guards and ordinary Venezuelans alike.\n\n“The pardons for Jan. 6 rioters were extended to all violent criminals, his DOGE disaster with (billionaire donor Elon) Musk, his reckless foreign policy adventurism, gross politicization of the Justice Department and deployment of the military to 10 American cities are all instances where the stated threat was not taken seriously enough by people,” said Amanda Carpenter, once a Republican Senate aide and now a researcher with the Protect Democracy nonprofit group.\n\nAmerican democracy’s last stand\n\nAs hopeless as it all might seem now to democracy defenders, Kagan, Levitsky and others believe a Trump autocracy can still be thwarted, although doing so now that he once more has the levers of presidential power is a considerably taller order than it would have been in 2023 and 2024.\n\nThe biggest challenge, they worry, remains persuading the 77 million Americans who, having watched Jan. 6 live on television and then listened as Trump campaigned on “retribution” and “taking back” the country from “vermin,” still believed that Trump was an acceptable choice as president and commander-in-chief of the armed forces.\n\nThe task is made even tougher when so many of the country’s top institutions ― business leaders, universities, major law firms ― quickly and publicly pledged their fealty to Trump. They donated millions to his inauguration and stood behind him as he let loose a speech packed with all his favorite grievances from his campaign. They caved to his open coercion and extortive demands. The head of Apple, the company that in 1984 released an iconic ad decrying tyranny, offered to Trump a solid gold trinket as tribute during an Oval Office visit.\n\n“If Columbia University and Paul, Weiss and Paramount can’t stand up to this government, then how the hell can the average American?” Levitsky wondered. “It’s a powerful signal.”\n\nYet even among those Americans who, unlike typical voters, do pay close attention to current affairs and do care deeply about the rule of law as a core value, the portrait of Trump as an emerging despot is still viewed as alarmist.\n\nHugh Culverhouse, a wealthy Miami lawyer who donated $500,000 to put Trump back in the White House, now has serious misgivings about his behavior in office. Back in 2024, he said he had no concerns about Trump’s autocratic tendencies because of the checks and balances provided by the judicial and legislative branches. “This will be a short period in history and we will swing right back to the middle,” he said then.\n\nToday, the one-time federal prosecutor said he is appalled by Trump’s extrajudicial killings. He opposes the clearly political prosecutions against his critics. As to the ICE presence in Minnesota: “Granted, what’s happening in Minneapolis is something that got out of hand.”\n\nYet Culverhouse does not blame the president for this, describing it as just Trump being Trump, behaving the same way he has his entire adult life. “You got a Doberman Pinscher. A Doberman by birth is aggressive,” he said. “You can’t breed it out of him.”\n\nInstead, Culverhouse blames Trump’s closest advisers for not reining him in and, most of all, members of Congress, of both parties, for not standing up to him. “The remedy is for the Republicans and Democrats in the House and Senate to do their fucking job,” he said.\n\nDespite all this, Culverhouse believes those who worry about a looming Trump dictatorship are still needlessly catastrophizing: “Outside of a law school professor wanting publicity, it’s never happened and it’s not going to happen.”\n\nKagan, as he did in his 2023 essay, said that depending on Congress to stand up to Trump is absurd. Just four Republican senators could, today, block Trump and save American democracy by voting with Democrats, he said. He was quick to add he has no illusions about that happening.\n\n“The Republican leaders in the Senate and the House are willing to have a dictatorship if they can keep their jobs,” he said.\n\nWhich means that the only way to check Trump’s continuing drive for autocracy is for everyday citizens who do care about democracy to turn out in droves come November and hand Republican candidates a resounding loss, Kagan and others said.\n\nThe results need to be unambiguous, Levitsky said, or Trump would try to overturn the results, just as he tried in 2020 after losing to Democrat Joe Biden by seven million votes.\n\n“I worry about ICE agents intimidating people at the polls,” Levitsky said. “We know they’re going to try to manipulate the election. The only question is if they are going to get away with it.”","url":"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-dictator-warning_n_696d9120e4b0fb912e992111?origin=home-latest-news-unit","image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/68cc46841800006db75cf912.jpeg?cache=GVeBqeQ5vb&ops=1778_1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-20 13:00:17","author":"S.v.

He pardoned hundreds of violent domestic terrorists who had assaulted police officers to advance his Jan. 6, 2021, coup attempt. He cut programs already funded by Congress and spent money on things for which they had not. He defied federal judges. He declared he had the authority to kill suspected drug smugglers on the high seas and then to attack a foreign country, without congressional approval, to capture its dictator.
