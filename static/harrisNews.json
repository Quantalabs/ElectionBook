The BBC said Chair Samir Shah sent a personal letter to the White House saying that he and the corporation were sorry for the edit of the speech Trump gave before some of his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol as Congress was poised to certify President-elect Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 election that Trump falsely alleged was stolen from him. The publicly funded broadcaster said there are no plans to rebroadcast the documentary, which had spliced together parts of his speech that came almost an hour apart. “We accept that our edit unintentionally created the impression that we were showing a single continuous section of the speech, rather than excerpts from different points in the speech, and that this gave the mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action,” the BBC wrote in a retraction. Trump’s lawyer had sent the BBC a letter demanding an apology and threatened to file a $1 billion lawsuit for the harm the documentary caused him. It had set a Friday deadline for the BBC to respond. While the BBC statement doesn’t respond to Trump’s demand that he be compensated for “overwhelming financial and reputational harm,” the headline on its news story about the apology said it refused to pay compensation. The dispute was sparked by an edition of the BBC’s flagship current affairs series “Panorama,” titled “Trump: A Second Chance?” broadcast days before the 2024 U.S. presidential election. The third-party production company that made the film spliced together three quotes from two sections of the 2021 speech into what appeared to be one quote in which Trump urged supporters to march with him and “fight like hell.” Among the parts cut out was a section where Trump said he wanted supporters to demonstrate peacefully. Director-General Tim Davie, along with news chief Deborah Turness, quit Sunday, saying the scandal was damaging the BBC and “as the CEO of BBC News and Current Affairs, the buck stops with me.” The letter from Trump’s lawyer demanded an apology to the president and a “full and fair” retraction of the documentary along with other “false, defamatory, disparaging, misleading or inflammatory statements” about Trump. Legal experts have said that Trump would face challenges taking the case to court in the U.K. or the U.S. They said that the BBC could show that Trump wasn’t harmed because he was ultimately elected president in 2024. Deadlines to bring the case in English courts, where defamation damages rarely exceed 100,000 pounds ($132,000) expired more than a year ago. Because the documentary was not shown in the U.S., it would be hard to show that Americans thought less of him because of a program they could not watch. While many legal experts have dismissed the president’s claims against the media as having little merit, he has won some lucrative settlements against U.S. media companies and he could try to leverage the BBC mistake for a payout, potentially to a charity of his choice. In July, Paramount, which owns CBS, agreed to pay $16 million to settle a lawsuit filed by Trump over a “ 60 Minutes” interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump alleged that the interview was edited to enhance how Harris, the Democratic nominee for president in 2024, sounded. That settlement came as the Trump-appointed head of the Federal Communications Commission launched an investigation that threatened to complicate Paramount’s need for administration approval to merge with Skydance Media. Last year, ABC News said it would pay $15 million to settle a defamation lawsuit over anchor George Stephanopoulos ’ inaccurate on-air assertion that the president-elect had been found civilly liable for raping writer E. Jean Carroll. A jury found that he was liable for sexually abusing her. The apology and retraction came as BBC said it was looking into a report in the Daily Telegraph that its Newsnight program in 2022 had similarly spliced together parts of the same speech by Trump.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/world/united-kingdom/bbc-apologizes-trump-misleading-edit-says-no-basis-defamation-claim-rcna243829","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-01/250103-Trump-Jan-6-2021-aa-1108-88559d.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-13 23:57:19","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.58},{"id":378779782,"title":"Kamala's 'ego' cannot stop her from running for president again: Kayleigh McEnany","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nThe Five November 13, 2025 04:03 \n\n Kamala's 'ego' cannot stop her from running for president again: Kayleigh McEnany \n 'The Five' co-hosts question what former Vice President Kamala Harris meant when she said she was playing 3-dimensional chess against President Donald Trump.\n Tags SHOWSWHAT TO WATCH | VIDEOSLATEST NEWS | VIDEOSON AIRTHE FIVEV-VIDEOPOLITICSKAMALA HARRISPRESIDENTIAL PRIMARIESDONALD TRUMP","summary":"&apos;The Five&apos; co-hosts question what former Vice President Kamala Harris meant when she said she was playing 3-dimensional chess against President Donald Trump.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6385073471112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/7f3452c4-4492-4231-b8bf-d388242f64a8/ce4b0026-8807-4bd4-8bd6-f6f2ebc40c7a/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-13 23:24:09","author":"President Trump","authors":["President Trump"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.629},{"id":378766264,"title":"BBC Apologizes to Trump Over Its Misleading Edit, but Says There’s No Basis for a Defamation Claim","text":"LONDON (AP) — The BBC apologized Thursday to U.S. President Donald Trump over a misleading edit of his speech on Jan. 6, 2021 but said it had not defamed him, rejecting the basis for his $1 billion lawsuit threat.\n\nThe BBC said Chair Samir Shah sent a personal letter to the White House saying that he and the corporation were sorry for the edit of the speech Trump gave before some of his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol as Congress was poised to certify President-elect Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 election that Trump falsely alleged was stolen from him.\n\nThe publicly funded broadcaster said there are no plans to rebroadcast the documentary, which had spliced together parts of his speech that came almost an hour apart.\n\n“We accept that our edit unintentionally created the impression that we were showing a single continuous section of the speech, rather than excerpts from different points in the speech, and that this gave the mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action,” the BBC wrote in a retraction.\n\nTrump’s lawyer had sent the BBC a letter demanding an apology and threatened to file a $1 billion lawsuit for the harm the documentary caused him.

Her support is only going to continue to climb. Elise already is the most well-funded candidate and highest polling candidate in history, and that will continue to climb.

Koh, who held several senior roles in former President Joe Biden’s White House, is running in a crowded race to replace Democratic Rep. Seth Moulton, who is running for the Senate. He has received the endorsement of Harris, who called him a \"fighter\" who \"knows how to get things done.\" Though running in a suburban Massachusetts district, Koh and his wife own a $1.3 million home in a swanky neighborhood by Capitol Hill, which they purchased in 2022, according to the website for the D.C. Office of Tax and Revenue. The two also own a home in Andover, Massachusetts, which sits within the 6th Congressional District, according to the North Essex Registry of Deeds. The Massachusetts home was purchased in 2019 for $810,000. KAMALA HARRIS SAYS DEMOCRATS TOOK BLACK WOMEN FOR GRANTED IN 2024 Amy Carnevale, chair of the Massachusetts Republican Party, knocked Koh over the home, telling Fox News Digital that \"living full-time in D.C. with a no-show house in Massachusetts seems to be a family tradition amongst MassDems.\" She also criticized another Massachusetts Democrat, Sen. Ed Markey, who she said is \"known in the Bay State as the ‘Senator from Chevy Chase,’\" because he \"is rarely seen in his alleged hometown in Massachusetts.\" \"Dan Koh is now looking to follow in that tradition. What a shame for actual residents of Massachusetts who deserve better,\" added Carnevale.

As former President John F. Kennedy’s only grandson, Schlossberg is practically political royalty. But to New York City’s chronically online electorate, he is better known as the star of hundreds of satirical, and often absurd, viral videos. Sometimes he sings bizarre love songs to Second Lady Usha Vance or trolls her husband, Vice President JD Vance. As a surrogate for former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024, Schlossberg teamed up with Democratic candidates nationwide, including former Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., who lost to Sen. Dave McCormick, R-Pa., last year. Between satirical renditions of Taylor Swift’s \"Love Story\" and answering a lobster like a phone in a spoof news bit, Schlossberg has cultivated a following any aspiring influencer would envy, with close to 850,000 TikTok followers and nearly 770,000 on Instagram. NEW JERSEY DEMOCRAT BREAKS RANKS TO SUPPORT REPUBLICAN JACK CIATTARELLI FOR GOVERNOR \"True or false: Usha Vance is way hotter than Jackie O,\" Schlossberg said on X earlier this year, referencing his grandmother, former First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. JOE KENNEDY III BLASTS RFK JR. AFTER FIERY SENATE HEARING, FUELING KENNEDY FAMILY INFIGHTING: 'HE MUST RESIGN' He later described his own comments as \"weird\" and \"creepy\" on former White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki's podcast \"The Blueprint.\" \"The internet is a place where it's difficult to break through, and it's difficult to break through if you are not saying something controversial or at least somehow unexpected,\" Schlossberg explained. \"I see that Democrats play that game not as well as we could, and I think I use my judgment to make posts that I think are funny or silly but have a purpose…\" Despite the followers and the Kennedy connections, Schlossberg has a slim résumé. He most recently served as a political correspondent for Vogue during the 2024 presidential election. He was also a Democratic National Committee delegate in 2024 and worked as a staff assistant at the U.S. Department of State in 2016. He is a graduate of Yale University and Harvard Law and Business Schools. According to his LinkedIn, Schlossberg has worked for the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation for 12 years, first as chair of the New Frontier Award, and now as chair of the Profiles in Courage Award. Schlossberg is the son of former U.S. Ambassador Caroline Kennedy. Schlossberg honored former Vice President Mike Pence with the Profiles in Courage Award earlier this year for defying President Donald Trump's request to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. The 32-year-old Kennedy heir is a frequent Trump critic. And while he often experiments with accents in his online skits, Schlossberg did not mince words about the president in his campaign launch video. In the vertical walk-and-talk style video, Schlossberg clipped a mini microphone to his crisp, blue button-down shirt and accused Trump of turning his second term into \"cronyism, not capitalism, and a constitutional crisis with one dangerous man in control of all three branches of government.\" Earlier this year, fellow New Yorker Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer appointed Schlossberg to the America 250 Commission, claiming there was \"no better person to push back\" on Trump's \"ego\" dominating the celebrations. Schlossberg has also been a vocal critic of his cousin, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who ran a failed presidential campaign last year before endorsing Trump and securing a cabinet position as secretary of Health and Human Services. Schlossberg accused Trump of dismantling the Kennedy legacy and called RFK Jr. a \"dangerous person\" on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" Wednesday. While it's clear that Schlossberg rejects Trump, his campaign priorities are not so obvious. In his campaign launch video, Schlossberg said he is running to replace the retiring Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., because New York's 12th Congressional District \"should have a representative who can harness the creativity, energy and drive\" of the city and translate it into \"political power and drive in Washington.\" His campaign website includes a short biography and donation links, but no policy proposals, only a list of \"12 promises\" to the district’s residents.

Newsom's powerful political orbit","text":"As Gov. Gavin Newsom flew around the country last year campaigning for President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, his chief of staff Dana Williamson — known as one of California's toughest political insiders — was not only helping to helm the ship in Sacramento, but under criminal investigation by federal law enforcement. The resulting criminal case, which splashed into public view with Williamson's arrest Wednesday, does not implicate Newsom in any wrongdoing. Williamson's alleged misdeeds occurred in private work prior to her joining his staff, and his office said it placed her on leave in November 2024 after she informed him she was under investigation. Nonetheless, the bombshell allegations struck at the center of the political power circle surrounding Newsom, rattling one of the nation's most prominent and important hubs of Democratic state power at a time when President Trump and his Republican administration wield power in Washington. Williamson was charged with bank and tax fraud for allegedly siphoning campaign and COVID-19 recovery funds into her and an associate's pockets and claiming personal luxuries as business expenses on tax forms. According to the indictment, the campaign funds were drawn from a dormant state account of another top California Democrat: gubernatorial candidate and former U.S. Health and Human Services secretary Xavier Becerra. Two other well-connected aides in state politics were also charged — and struck plea deals confirming the scheme — while a third, with deep ties to one of the most well-connected circles of political and business consultants in the country, appeared in charging documents as an uncharged co-conspirator. Williamson’s attorney McGregor Scott, a former U.S. attorney in Sacramento, told The Times on Wednesday that federal authorities had approached Williamson more than a year ago, seeking help with some kind of probe of the governor himself. “She told them she had no information to provide them, and then we wind up today with these charges,” Scott said. The nature of that alleged probe is unclear. Newsom's office on Thursday said it was \"not aware of any federal investigation involving the governor.\" Lauren Horwood, a spokesperson for the U.S. attorney's office in Sacramento, said she could not confirm or deny the existence of any investigation involving Newsom, in accordance with Justice Department policy. None of the charging documents released in the cases against the three aides mention Newsom. A loquacious liberal foil to Trump and likely 2028 presidential contender, Newsom has been in Brazil since Sunday and on Wednesday left for a planned trip into the Amazon with a small delegation after attending the United Nations climate summit known as COP30. He left the conference before news of Williamson's arrest, and could not be reached directly by The Times for comment. In his absence, Newsom's representatives have tried to draw a connection between the federal case and the contentious relationship between California and the Trump administration, though offered no evidence that the investigation was influenced by the White House. \"At a time when the president is openly calling for his attorney general to investigate his political enemies, it is especially important to honor the American principle of being innocent until proven guilty in a court of law by a jury of one’s peers,\" a Newsom spokesperson said Wednesday. \"Under the Trump administration, the DOJ routinely targets the state, which has resulted in us suing the federal administration 46 times,\" a Newsom spokesperson said Thursday. Trump and his administration have been accused of using their power — and control over the Justice Department — to go after his political enemies. Charges reportedly deemed weak and unfounded by career prosecutors have been brought forward anyway against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Atty. Gen. Letitia James, while Sen. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) is being investigated for years-old occupancy claims in mortgage documents. All have denied wrongdoing. The case against Williamson and the other California aides, however, is something different — originating years ago under the Biden administration. \"Today’s charges are the result of three years of relentless investigative work, in partnership with IRS Criminal Investigation and the U.S. Attorney’s Office,\" FBI Sacramento Special Agent in Charge Sid Patel said Wednesday. Abigail Jackson, a White House spokesperson, rejected the notion that the case was in any way driven by the Trump administration or politically motivated. \"What an absurd claim to make when public reporting has already noted that this investigation began under the Biden DOJ,\" Jackson said. \"The Trump administration is restoring integrity and accountability to the Justice Department.\" Prosecutors also have plea deals with two of the primary suspects in the case, in which they corroborate some of the allegations. According to the 23-count indictment, unsealed Wednesday morning, Williamson conspired with Sean McCluskie — a former top aid to Becerra — and lobbyist Greg Campbell to bill Becerra's dormant state campaign account for bogus consulting services. The three allegedly used shell companies to funnel money out of the campaign fund starting in 2022. Federal authorities alleged the bulk of the payments were made to McCluskie's wife, who did not actually provide consulting services, and deposited into an account accessed by McCluskie. Becerra, who has not been accused of wrongdoing, said Wednesday's charges alleging \"impropriety by a long-serving trusted advisor are a gut punch,\" and that he was cooperating with authorities. In addition, Williamson was charged with falsifying documents for a COVID-era small business loan, and with claiming luxury goods and services — including a $15,353 Chanel purse, $21,000 in private jet travel and a $150,000 birthday trip to Mexico, complete with an $11,000 yacht trip — as business expenses on her tax returns, federal prosecutors said. Williamson appeared in federal court in Sacramento on Wednesday afternoon, and pleaded not guilty to the charges. Williamson's attorney said he has been in \"regular communication\" with federal prosecutors about the case for some time, and had asked to meet with prosecutors to \"present our side\" before any charges were brought, but that request \"was not honored.\" Instead, officials \"chose grandstanding instead of the normal process\" and arrested Williamson at home Wednesday, despite her being seriously ill and in need of a liver transplant, Scott said. Williamson could not be reached for comment directly. Williamson previously worked as a Cabinet secretary to former Gov. Jerry Brown, who also could not be reached for comment Thursday. The case against Williamson is bolstered by acknowledgments of guilt from at least two others. McCluskie — a former chief deputy attorney general of California when Becerra was attorney general — pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud and is cooperating with authorities, court filings show. He could not be reached for comment. Campbell pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud and conspiracy to defraud and commit offenses against the U.S. government. Campbell's attorney Todd Pickles said his client \"takes full accountability for his actions and is cooperating fully with the legal process.\" The case also involves another longtime California political insider: Alexis Podesta, a former secretary of the California Business, Consumer Services and Housing Agency who Newsom appointed to the State Compensation Insurance Fund board of directors in January 2020. A spokesperson for the board confirmed Podesta remained a member as of Thursday morning. Bill Portanova, Podesta’s attorney, confirmed to The Times that Podesta is the person identified as \"Co-Conspirator 2\" in charging documents — including McCluskie's plea agreement, which alleges she funneled the campaign funds to him. Portanova said Podesta inherited responsibilities for handling the Becerra account from Williamson when Williamson left to become Newsom's chief of staff. Podesta did not perceive anything \"unusual about the accounts, how they were set up or who had set them up,\" so continued making payments as previously arranged, Portanova said. However, \"when confronted with the information that it was improper payments,\" Portanova said, she immediately stopped the payments, and \"has been fully cooperative with the federal authorities at every stage of these proceedings.\" He said she is not charged, and \"should not be charged\" moving forward. He otherwise declined to comment, as \"investigations are ongoing.\" Podesta had close ties to some of the most influential Democratic political consultants in California, adding to the intrigue surrounding the case. In September 2020 — about eight months after Newsom had appointed Podesta to the insurance board for workers' compensation — Politico reported on a new \"influence superteam\" of Democratic political consultants forming in California. The project, it said, would be called the Collaborative. Among its \"architects\" were Williamson and Campbell, as well as Jim DeBoo, another former Newsom chief of staff. Its managing director, the outlet reported, would be Podesta. Among its enlisted consultants, it said, would be Sean Clegg of Bearstar Strategies, another senior advisor to Newsom, and Shannon Murphy, of M Strategic Communications, who has ties to Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass. DeBoo, Clegg and Murphy have not been accused of any wrongdoing. \"Bearstar participated in a joint marketing press release with the Collaborative and worked on one campaign with the Collaborative’s members in 2022. Bearstar and its partners had no interest, stake or other involvement with this entity,\" David Beltran, a representative of Bearstar, said in a statement Thursday. Murphy also released a statement about the enterprise: \"Five years ago, our firm participated in a joint-marketing effort. We had zero ownership or role in the business entity that was created and had no knowledge of its finances or operations until yesterday’s news stories.\" DeBoo did not respond to requests for comment Thursday. Members of the Collaborative advise some of the largest companies in not just the country, but the world. The Collaborative's website was recently scaled down to a simple landing page, but it previously touted itself there as \"the hub for the most talented public affairs, campaign, crisis management, communications and lobbying firms in California,\" providing clients \"the ability to choose one or several firms that work together — rather than compete — to provide their clients with the best possible outcomes.\" The website led with what it called a proverb: \"If you call one wolf, you invite the pack.\"","summary":"Several California political insiders were targeted in a probe by federal law enforcement, with Gov.

But despite all their talk about being the fair, egalitarian, and democratically spirited party, Democrats seem to have a unique problem of hand-selecting candidates without input from the electorate.\n\nIn the heat of the 2024 election, the party effectively coronated Vice President Kamala Harris once Joe Biden dropped out, rather than having a more open and fair primary process to pick a nominee at the DNC’s convention. You could argue that, of course, she’d take up the mantle, as she was already the VP. But critics contended it was anti-democratic in spirit, and made the party seem elitist, hypocritical, and dismissive of the grassroots base, who likely would have opted for anyone but Harris. (Subscribe to MR. RIGHT, a free weekly newsletter about modern masculinity)\n\nAhead of a vote to reopen the government Wednesday, Democratic Washington Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez went rogue on her party and called attention to a similarly shady political maneuver.\n\nA Blue Dog Democrat who hasn’t been afraid to buck her colleagues in the past, Gluesenkamp Perez submitted a resolution to condemn the retiring Democratic Illinois Rep. Chuy Garcia. Garcia had filed to run again Oct. 27, though quickly reversed course and announced that he would not be seeking a second term — but only after the filing deadline had passed. As a result, his chief of staff, Patty Garcia, automatically became the Democratic nominee for the upcoming midterm election, effectively nuking the electorate’s chance to pick from a broader pool of candidates in a primary. It was a shady and unethical move, to say the least.\n\nGluesenkamp Perez’s resolution to condemn Rep. Garcia holds privileged status, so now the House must cast a vote on it by next Tuesday, unless she withdraws the measure. It describes Garcia’s actions as “beneath the dignity of his office and incompatible with the spirit of the Constitution.”\n\nIn a statement, Gluesenkamp Perez said that Garcia’s “stated reasons for retirement are honorable, but his decision to anoint an heir is fundamentally undemocratic.”\n\n“This is the kind of thing that makes folks tune out of electoral politics … If we fail to hold our colleagues accountable for this subversion of elections, we own the consequences,” she said.\n\nOne anonymous House Democrat complained to Axios, “Everybody has been trying to say to her, ‘Why today?’ We have really focused, important work to do today.'”\n\n“It should obviously be the jurisdiction of the election officials in Chicago and Illinois,” Democratic Texas Rep. Sylvia Garcia told the outlet. “It didn’t make sense. It’s very disappointing. It’s very unusual.”\n\nBut Gluesenkamp Perez is correct to call out Garcia’s behavior, and why not do it during the debate on the stopgap funding bill? What is there to lose at this point? Democrats were already completely fragmented and bickering among themselves after the eight senators joined with Republicans to advance a deal Sunday to end the shutdown. Schumer was left embarrassed, the likes of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez were left enraged, and Democrats got nothing out of their month-long fight against the GOP. \n\nIf anything, voting on Gluesenkamp Perez’s resolution and condemning Garcia, who’s already on his way out the door, might actually do the party some good. It might signal to voters that, although they are still a party of backroom-dealing elites, at least they try to pretend like they are actually fair and democratic, with a lower-case ‘d.’ \n\nAnd, with the Republican Party and the Trump administration dealing with their own slew of problems, namely MAGA’s backlash to some recent Trump proposals like the 50-year mortgage and the newly released cache of Epstein emails, a resolution isn’t going to make the Democrats seem any less cohesive. It will only make them seem a bit more trustworthy.","summary":"What do you think?","url":"https://dailycaller.com/2025/11/13/marie-gluesenkamp-perez-house-floor-vote-condemn-chuy-garcia-heir-anoint/","image":"https://images.dailycaller.com/image/width=1280,height=549,fit=cover,format=webp,f=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn01.dailycaller.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2025%2F11%2FGettyImages-1442615905-scaled-e1763066462871.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-13 21:03:30","author":"John Loftus","authors":["John Loftus"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.207},{"id":378753174,"title":"Arynne Wexler: Democrats Will Cause All The Problems But Republicans Will Solve None Of Them","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nRadio Faa November 13, 2025 00:00 \n\n Arynne Wexler: Democrats Will Cause All The Problems But Republicans Will Solve None Of Them \n Arynne Wexler joins Jimmy Failla on Fox Across America to share her thoughts on whether the Republican Party has been able to maintain its popularity with voters just over a year after President Trump's resounding victory over Kamala Harris. \n Tags FOX NEWS RADIO","summary":"Arynne Wexler joins Jimmy Failla on Fox Across America to share her thoughts on whether the Republican Party has been able to maintain its popularity with voters just over a year after President Trump&apos;s resounding victory over Kamala Harris.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6385067452112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/static/orion/styles/img/fox-news/og/1024/512/og-fox-news.png?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-13 20:54:55","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.321},{"id":378751308,"title":"At the Races: Back to our regularly scheduled programming","text":"Welcome to At the Races!

They can subscribe here.\n\nBy Mary Ellen McIntire, Daniela Altimari and Niels Lesniewski\n\nThe House voted Wednesday night to end the longest partial government shutdown in history, and President Donald Trump signed the bill shortly thereafter, bringing to a close a turbulent stretch on Capitol Hill.\n\nSix House Democrats joined all but two voting Republicans in support of the spending package. And they all represent swing seats: retiring Maine Rep. Jared Golden, who had voted to keep the government open in September; Washington Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Pérez; Texas Rep. Henry Cuellar; North Carolina Rep. Don Davis; California Rep. Adam Gray; and New York Rep. Tom Suozzi. \n\nWhile several of the eight Senate Democrats who voted with Republicans to reopen the government earlier this week also represent swing states, none of them are set to face voters until at least 2028.\n\nIf past is prologue, the shutdown itself won’t be top of mind for voters in next year’s midterm elections. But its themes will likely continue to be litigated, especially with a yet-to-be-determined health care bill expected to hit the Senate floor before Dec. 31 to address the expiring enhanced tax credits at the heart of the shutdown. \n\nThat measure could be a chance for centrist lawmakers to flex their deal-making muscles on an issue that Democrats have signaled they will try to make central to their affordability agenda in 2026. \n\nBoth the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and the Democratic nonprofit Majority Forward this week announced ad campaigns targeting Republicans in key states over rising health care costs. \n\nStill, Democrats once again find themselves torn over how their members have handled the end of the government shutdown. Liberal groups are calling for Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer to step down, although the New York Democrat appears to still have the support of the caucus. \n\nThe tension extended to the House side on Wednesday, when Gluesenkamp Pérez gave notice of her intent to call up a disapproval resolution against fellow Democratic Rep. Jesús “Chuy” García, who confirmed last week that he won’t seek reelection but only after his chief of staff was the lone Democrat besides him to file for his Chicago-area seat before the filing deadline.\n\nStarting gate\n\nBlue Utah: House Democrats scored a big legal victory this week when a Utah judge picked a new congressional map that presents an obvious Democratic pickup opportunity in Salt Lake City. Former Rep. Ben McAdams on Thursday announced his bid for the newly drawn 1st District, a day after fellow Democratic state Sen. Kathleen Riebe threw her hat into the ring.\n\nComeback bid: Former Rep. Elaine Luria, a Virginia Democrat, has launched a campaign to retake the Hampton Roads-based seat that she lost to Republican Jen Kiggans in 2022.\n\nWood pivots to House: Democrat Jordan Wood, a former congressional staffer who’d been running for Senate in Maine, has switched to the race for the state’s largely rural 2nd District. Wood made the move after the Democratic incumbent, Rep. Jared Golden, announced he wouldn’t run again.\n\nHe’s running: Jack Schlossberg, the grandson of President John F. Kennedy, announced he would run for New York’s 12th District, an open seat that’s drawn a growing field of Democrats seeking to succeed Rep. Jerrold Nadler. New York City Council Member Erik Bottcher on Thursday became the latest candidate to announce a bid for the deep-blue Manhattan district. \n\nAnd they’re calling it quits: New Jersey Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman won’t seek reelection next year, saying it’s “time to pass the torch” as she leaves behind a safe Democratic seat in central New Jersey. She’s joined by House Budget Chairman Jodey C. Arrington, who also said he would retire next year after five terms representing a deep-red seat in rural West Texas. CQ Roll Call Managing Editor Peter Cohn looked at Arrington’s time atop the Budget panel. \n\n#NYGOV: New York Rep. Elise Stefanik launched her long-awaited gubernatorial bid last week after months of sparring with Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul.\n\nEndorsements: Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders endorsed Minnesota Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan for her state’s open Senate seat. Americans for Prosperity Action backed former Sen. John E. Sununu for New Hampshire’s open Senate seat. Former Rep. John Duarte endorsed Republican Kevin Lincoln to unseat Rep. Adam Gray, who ousted Duarte from California’s 13th District last year. Duarte had previously been supporting Ceres Mayor Javier Lopez against Gray. \n\nNew maps, new campaigns: California Senate leader Mike McGuire is launching a bid for the state’s 1st District, which became significantly bluer under a map approved by voters earlier this month. Republican incumbent Doug LaMalfa hasn’t said whether he’ll run for reelection from his redrawn seat. Elsewhere in the Golden State, Navy veteran Marc Iannarino is joining the increasingly crowded field of Democrats running for the 48th District, a new battleground seat. GOP incumbent Darrell Issa also hasn’t said whether he’ll run for reelection here. And in Texas, Democratic Rep. Al Green will seek reelection in the redrawn 18th District, which has largely subsumed the deep-blue seat he has represented since 2005. Green’s decision sets up a primary battle with the winner of the special election to fill the 18th District as it is currently drawn.\n\nBattleground launches: Army veteran Michael Bouchard launched a campaign in Michigan’s 10th District, an open seat that GOP Rep. John James is vacating to run for governor. Bouchard’s father, Mike, is the longtime sheriff of Oakland County. In New Hampshire, Elizabeth Girard, a co-chair of Trump’s 2024 campaign in the state, said she was running for the open 1st District, a swing seat currently held by Democratic Senate hopeful Rep. Chris Pappas. \n\nPrimary watch: Democratic National Committee member Latonya Reeves said she would challenge Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar in the 5th District primary next year. Omar has successfully beaten back other primary challenges since she was first elected in 2018. In New York City, Rep. Ritchie Torres is facing multiple new primary challengers, including former DNC Vice Chair Michael Blake, a former state assemblyman who ran unsuccessfully for mayor this year, and Dalourny Nemorin, a public defender and member of the Democratic Socialists of America’s New York City chapter.\n\nAlso in NYC: New York City Council Member Chi Ossé has said he plans to challenge House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries in his Brooklyn-based district next year, although Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, whose views Ossé is aligned with, has sought to discourage him from doing so. \n\nDropping out: The crowded field of Democrats vying to replace New York Republican Rep. Mike Lawler thinned by one as attorney Jessica Reinmann scrapped her bid and endorsed Army veteran Cait Conley. In Southern California, Democratic former Chino Valley school board member Christina Gagnier suspended her campaign to unseat Republican Rep. Young Kim in the 40th District, which becomes significantly redder under the state’s new map. And in Ohio, businessman Fred Ode ended his Senate run against fellow Democrat Sherrod Brown. Ode had put $5 million into his campaign.\n\n#MISEN: Former Michigan Rep. Mike Rogers has had the Republican field to himself in the state’s open Senate race, but that appears to be changing. Bernadette Smith, who recently resigned as a co-chair of Michigan’s Republican Party, filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission to form a Senate campaign. \n\n#KYSEN: Champion horse trainer Dale Romans is launching a bid for Kentucky’s open Senate seat. Romans told The New York Times that he’s running as an “independent Democrat” in the ruby-red state. He joins four Democrats in the primary, including Amy McGrath, who lost to Sen. Mitch McConnell by 20 points in 2020 despite spending nearly $93 million.\n\nAnother Pelosi on the ballot: California Democrat Christine Pelosi, the daughter of former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, will seek the state Senate seat of Democrat Scott Weiner, who’s running to succeed her mother in her San Francisco-based district. Weiner’s seat would become vacant if he wins election to the 11th District next year, or the younger Pelosi would have to wait until 2028, when he would be term-limited. \n\nGuv roundup: Connecticut Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont kicked off his run for a third term last week. In Texas, former Rep. Chris Bell entered the Democratic primary to unseat Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, some two decades after losing the 2006 gubernatorial contest to Republican Rick Perry. Abbott launched his bid for a fourth term on Sunday. In New Mexico, state Sen. Steve Lanier is the latest Republican hoping to succeed term-limited Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham. Alaska state Sen. Matt Claman became the second Democrat to launch a bid for the Frontier State’s open governorship. Republican Zach Lahn, a farmer and businessman from eastern Iowa, announced a campaign for governor of the Hawkeye State. And in Minnesota, businessman Patrick Knight joined a crowded GOP field seeking to unseat Democratic-Farmer-Labor Gov. Tim Walz, who’s seeking a third term.\n\nDismissed: A federal district judge dismissed a lawsuit against pollster J. Ann Selzer brought by a Des Moines Register subscriber. The case centered on a poll Selzer published before the 2024 presidential election that showed Kamala Harris leading Trump by 3 points in Iowa. A different lawsuit, filed by Trump over the same poll, is pending.\n\nProgressive win: Activist Katie Wilson is the apparent winner of Seattle’s mayoral election. According to The Seattle Times, Wilson, who ran on a progressive platform, had a 1,976-vote lead over incumbent Bruce Harrell as of Wednesday, with not enough outstanding ballots for her opponent to catch up. The 43-year-old will be the Emerald City’s first millennial mayor. \n\nNathan’s notes\n\nRepublicans had hoped mid-decade redistricting would help them pad their majority in the 2026 midterm elections. But, so far at least, Democrats appear to be holding their own in the mapmaking fight, Roll Call elections analyst Nathan L. Gonzales of Inside Elections writes. \n\nThe new congressional lines have also prompted a flurry of race rating changes by Inside Elections. \n\nWhat we’re reading\n\n#NHSEN: The entrance of Republican former Sen. John E. Sununu into New Hampshire’s open Senate race has Granite State Democrats warning the national party not to sleep on the contest, NBC News reports. \n\nSame playbook, different outcome: Republicans in Virginia and New Jersey leaned on anti-transgender messaging, but the line of attack didn’t have the same resonance that it had in 2024. The GOP, however, doesn’t plan to abandon such messaging for the midterms, NOTUS details.\n\nRethinking Fetterman: Leah Abrams, a former consultant for Sen. John Fetterman, reflected in The Nation on her growing disenchantment with the Pennsylvania Democrat.\n\nAll politics is local: Alex Seitz-Wald traded national politics for local news when he quit NBC News to become an editor at the Midcoast Villager, a newspaper based in Camden, Maine. But with the Pine Tree State home to several of the most consequential 2024 campaigns, Seitz-Wald is once again at the center of national political coverage, The Boston Globe reports.\n\nThe count: 42 days, 22 hours and 24 minutes\n\nThat’s how long the longest partial government shutdown lasted, from Oct. 1 through Wednesday night, when Trump signed the short-term spending measure, according to tabulations from our colleague Bill Frischling and Roll Call’s Factba.se. \n\nAs Bill notes, 42:22:24 is also a palindrome. \n\nAnd here’s another shutdown-themed time stat from Factba.se: 29 days, 8 hours, 11 minutes and 3 seconds.\n\nThat’s how long Arizona Democrat Adelita Grijalva waited from electoral certification to her swearing-in Wednesday. In total, she waited more than seven weeks from the time she declared victory in the Sept. 23 special election to succeed her late father in Arizona’s 7th District. Roll Call’s Noella Kertes has more.\n\nNew Jersey Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill gave her final House floor speech Wednesday, saying she expects to submit her resignation next week. \n\nSherrill will vacate a North Jersey seat she has held since 2019, and a crowded Democratic primary is already shaping up for the upcoming 11th District special election. The New Jersey Globe reports that outgoing Lt. Gov. Tahesha Way is expected to join the field, which already includes former Rep. Tom Malinowski, Essex County Commissioner Brandon Gill and Passaic County Commissioner John Bartlett. \n\nPhoto finish\n\nSubscribe now using this link so you don’t miss out on the best news and analysis from our team.","url":"https://rollcall.com/2025/11/13/at-the-races-shutdown-redistricting/","image":"https://rollcall.com/app/uploads/2024/12/AT-THE-RACES-LOGO-2024RCHP16x9.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-13 20:01:00","author":"Posted November 13, 2025 At 3:01pm","authors":["Posted November 13, 2025 At 3:01pm"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.246},{"id":378735584,"title":"Dems Need To Win Back Young Men.

(Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)\n\nFor a party that claims to have learned its lesson after losing yet again to Donald Trump, Democratic leaders continue to be entirely out of touch with swing voters. From Hakeem Jeffries to Chuck Schumer, Democratic leaders across the country reluctantly or failed to endorse the future mayor of New York, Zohran Mamdani. Whether it is out of fear of an electoral backlash in 2026, pressure from wealthy donors, or personal pettiness, the Democratic establishment’s failure to genuinely support the new Democratic mayor is an enormous political miscalculation.\n\nBecause to win back these young male swing voters, the new 34-year-old mayor of New York is the only light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nWhile much has been made of Mamdani’s policy platforms, which, despite media narratives, are in lockstep with traditional Democratic policy priorities, Mamdani’s rise is mainly rooted in his ability to communicate with voters. The best example of this unprecedentedly effective communication style was during Mamdani’s interview with comedian, actor and podcast host Andrew Schulz. Schulz, a life-long Democrat who voted for Trump in 2024, has interviewed numerous Democrats on his podcast Flagrant, though only after the 2024 elections, once Democrats realized Schulz influences young men.\n\nYet from Bernie Sanders, to Pete Buttigieg, to Ezra Klein, no guest on Schulz’s show shone as bright as Zohran Mamdani.\n\nOne of the oldest adages in American politics is the “beer question.” Because at the end of the day, Americans are not voting for who has the best policies. They’re voting for who is more relatable, someone they can have a beer with. And while most readers of this op-ed are tuned in, young men aren’t reading this or watching MSNBC and C-SPAN. They’re watching basketball, MMA and OnlyFans models on TikTok. And while there is gender bias at the root of the “beer question,” Democrats can’t have their beer and drink it too. Democrats can either win elections or continue to mansplain intersectionality to the young male swing voters who have fled our party in droves.\n\nDuring his interview with Schulz, Mamdani discussed his policy priorities, from freezing rents to universal child care to opening more city-run grocery stores in New York that already exist. And while Schulz and his co-hosts were thankful for Mamdani’s acknowledgment and eagerness to fix a broken system, what really won them over was Mamdani’s ability to just be another guy at the bar. Whether they will admit it or not, Mamdani is a natural fit in the Flagrant fantasy football league. While you can tell Schulz likes Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg and Ezra Klein, only Mamdani gets the invite to the bachelor party. Mamdani bantered, roasted and genuinely looked like he was enjoying being one of the guys. At no point could you tell Mamdani was faking a laugh or forcing a smile, even when Schulz pushed the envelope in ways that would make most other Democrats grimace.\n\nCase in point: The opening clip of the episodes was Schulz’s co-host, Akaash Singh, asking for Mamdani’s personal phone number. Because even if Mr. Mamdani wasn’t running for office, this is the kind of person you would love to grab a beer with. And Singh isn’t the only one: According to exit polling, Mamdani won the under-30 vote by 54 points. That is over 30 points higher than what Kamala Harris achieved with urban under-30 voters last year.\n\nOne of the most telling examples of Mamdani’s charisma during the interview occurred when Schulz and his hosts discussed his heritage. At one point, Schulz joked that Mamdani was “barely even Indian,” given he’s from Uganda, a clear-as-day micro-aggression that would cause panic attacks on college campuses across the country. And if Mamdani were your typical Democrat, he would have turned stone cold, perhaps lecturing Schulz about intersectionality. But what does he do? He got all of Schulz’ co-hosts on his side and roasted Schulz to perfection, with Akaash Singh telling Schulz at the end of Mamdani’s explanation, “S**t on that, f**k boy.”\n\nYou can’t just copy and paste Mamdani’s entire playbook in every congressional distric...","summary":"You can’t copy and paste Mamdani’s playbook and expect it to land.

Ben McAdams launches comeback bid in Utah ","text":"Former Utah Rep. Ben McAdams announced a comeback bid Thursday, entering the Democratic primary for a new deep-blue seat that could test the appeal of his past moderate voting record. \n\n“I’m ready to put it all on the line. I’ve done it before, to stand up against [Donald] Trump when it was hard, not just when it was expected,” McAdams said in a video launching his campaign for the 1st District. \n\nHis announcement comes days after a Utah judge picked a new congressional map, which creates a district anchored in Salt Lake City that Kamala Harris would have carried by 24 points, according to calculations by Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales. Earlier this summer, the judge had tossed out Utah’s current map — under which Republicans hold all four of the state’s House seats — ruling that it did not comply with anti-gerrymandering provisions in state law. \n\nMcAdams, the most recent Democrat to represent Utah in Congress, said the central message of his campaign would be addressing cost-of-living concerns. \n\n“Too many Utah families are working harder than ever but not making ends meet. To Donald Trump and the D.C. elite, affordability is just a slogan,” he wrote on social media. \n\nHe won’t have the primary to himself. On Wednesday, state Sen. Kathleen Riebe entered the race, while another Democratic state senator, Nate Blouin, is considering a bid, according to the Deseret News. Riebe is making her second bid for Congress after losing a House special election in 2023. \n\nMcAdams has strong ties to the area, having previously served as Salt Lake County mayor and a state senator. A seventh-generation Utahn, he completed a Mormon mission in Brazil and practiced law in New York before moving back home to work on federal securities regulation compliance. \n\nIn 2018, he unseated Republican Rep.

Liz Cheney on Wednesday for the statements he made about her following former Vice President Dick Cheney’s death.\n\nFollowing Cheney’s death, Carlson told Sirius XM’s Megyn Kelly that he would “consider” suicide if he had a daughter like Liz Cheney. During the episode of “The Tucker Carlson Show,” Carlson said that he attacked Cheney’s daughter in a “vicious way” and that it was hard for him to believe that he said that.\n\n“And I said that her father would be ashamed of her, and if I had a daughter like that, I’d probably kill myself, which is an awful thing to say. It’s kind of hard to believe I said that,” Carlson said. “But in my mind, I was thinking of all the people I dislike, Liz Cheney would probably be at the top of the list … Because we disagree so profoundly, I told myself, clearly, I must have told myself that you can say anything you want about Liz Cheney. She’s not really human. You can say anything you want, including something really awful and nasty, like if I was her dad, I would kill myself. Who thinks like that? Who talks like that? Well, I did.” (RELATED: Trump Drops Truth Bomb On Liz Cheney. Media Has No Choice But To Spread Fake News)\n\n“And so I just want to say I’m sorry to Liz Cheney, and I mean that too. I mean that. I shouldn’t have said that,” Carlson continued. \n\nDuring his appearance with Kelly, Carlson made the comment after he said that the former vice president raised a “repulsive daughter.” Carlson has been highly critical of Cheney, stating on his former program on Fox News that Cheney is a “neocon warmonger” and a “liar.”\n\nHe criticized Cheney for her role on the January 6th Select Committee and for her endorsement of former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nThe former vice president died on Nov. 4 at the age of 84 due to complications of pneumonia and cardiac and vascular disease.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

There will also be two special elections held, in Ohio and Florida, to fill vacancies left by appointees of President Donald Trump.\n\nEarlier this month, Democrats notched wins in gubernatorial races, mayoral contests and a key ballot measure, but a tougher 2026 U.S. Senate map could temper that momentum heading into the midterms.\n\nDemocrats will need to win double-digit GOP seats to gain control of the Senate, where Republicans hold a 53-47 majority. Democrats view Maine, which voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris by about 7 points in 2024, and North Carolina, which voted for Trump by about 3 points, as opportunities to flip.\n\nNorth Carolina is known for ticket splitting, where voters back two different parties for national and state office. In the 2024 election, North Carolina voters backed Trump for a third time but supported Democrats down the ballot, including for governor, attorney general, superintendent, and secretary of state. Candidates are running to replace retiring Republican Senator Thom Tillis.\n\nFormer North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper speaks at a campaign event in Charlotte, North Carolina, on September 12, 2024.\n\nWhat To Know\n\nA new Harper Polling survey of 600 likely voters in the 2026 general election in North Carolina found Cooper leading two Republican candidates.\n\nIn a match-up between Cooper and former Republican National Committee (RNC) chair Michael Whatley, voters back Cooper 47 percent to Whatley’s 38.6 percent.\n\nAgainst Republican Don Brown, a former Navy Judge Advocate General (JAG) officer, Cooper has a 10-percentage point lead, 48 percent compared with Brown’s 38 percent.\n\nThe poll also found that Democratic Governor Josh Stein had a 49.5 percent approval rating, and Trump had a 45.7 percent approval rating. The poll was conducted between November 9-10 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.\n\nAggregate poll RealClearPolling has Cooper with a narrower lead, 3.4 percentage points, on Whatley, with 45.7 percent to Whatley’s 42.3 percent.\n\nIn October, Cooper’s campaign announced that he raised $14.5 million in the third quarter of 2025. His campaign touted that as the “largest amount ever raised during a U.S. Senate challenger campaign’s first quarter and raised in only 65 days since the campaign launched.” \n\nWhatley, meanwhile, raised $5.8 million in the third quarter, reported The Washington Examiner.\n\nAn Emerson College survey from July showed Cooper leading Whatley by six points, 47 percent to 41 percent. The poll, conducted from July 28 to July 30, surveyed 1,000 registered voters and had a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.\n\nMeanwhile, a Harper poll showed Cooper up four points, 46 percent to 42 percent. The survey was conducted from September 14 to September 15 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.98 percentage points.\n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\nFormer North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper said in an X post on November 7: “North Carolina farmers are hurting. Today, I heard from some of them about how reckless tariffs are driving up their prices while reducing their export markets. My opponent cheers on this trade war while our farmers and North Carolinians who buy their products suffer.”\n\nFormer RNC Chair Michael Whatley said in an X post on November 10: “As Governor, Roy Cooper’s ‘reimagining’ of law enforcement turned into a revolving door for violent career criminals, including creating cashless bail and pretrial release. Commuting the sentences of 15 violent convicted murderers as his final act as governor was the capstone of his soft-on-crime, hard-on-victims policy. As Governor, he fought harder for criminals than he did their victims. In the Senate, he would be in lockstep with the Democrats’ weak-on-crime agenda.”\n\nFormer JAG officer Don Brown said in an X post on November 10: “The voters of North Carolina deserve a debate in this contested Republican primary for U.S. Senate.”\n\nWhat Happens Next\n\nThe 2026 elections are a year away, with some primaries scheduled within the next six months. Traditionally, the party that does not hold the White House tends to perform better in midterms.","summary":"A new poll finds Democrat Roy Cooper leading Republican candidates in the 2026 Senate race.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/roy-cooper-chances-flipping-north-carolina-gop-senate-seat-11040850","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AP25200645780001.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-13 17:00:00","author":"Mandy Taheri","authors":["Mandy Taheri"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.215},{"id":378672446,"title":"MS NOW officially launches with this weekend show, whose hosts put the nail in Cuomo’s electoral hopes","text":"On Saturday, a new era in cable news will officially begin. After nearly three decades, MSNBC will shed its original name to become MS NOW, launching an independent newsroom under a new parent company as it fully separates itself from NBC News.\n\nThe first program to debut under the new MS NOW banner? The network's weekend morning program appropriately named… The Weekend, which is hosted by Pulitzer Prize winner Jonathan Capehart, senior Washington reporter Eugene Daniels, and Washington reporter Jackie Alemany. \n\nIt was also The Weekend where Andrew Cuomo seemingly put the final nail in his New York City electoral hopes, declaring to the world that “diversity can be a weakness” and seemingly mistaking the show’s two Black hosts with one another.\n\n“I've never seen anything like that in my years at MS, certainly, where an interview just takes off,” Capehart told The Independent.\n\nAnd while the pressure of being the first to broadcast the change is palpable, but the hosts appear to be embracing the moment.\n\n“Our show is the first MS NOW show that will air when the turn happens,” Daniels said in an interview with The Independent. “We get to be kind of the first face for the world to see that this is the exact same show that people were watching last weekend. It will be the exact same network. It just has a new name.”\n\nThe network's rebrand is more than just a name change; it represents a significant structural shift. MS NOW is separating from NBCUniversal’s news division to stand up a modern, independent newsroom under Versant, which was formed by NBC’s parent company Comcast as a “spin off” of the bulk of its cable networks and digital assets. \n\nFor the journalists staying with the left-leaning cable news network, the transition is seen as a commitment to growth and reporting at a time when much of the industry is struggling. While other broadcast networks and legacy media outlets are contracting and slashing newsrooms, MS NOW is hiring.\n\n“The most exciting thing is in an industry that is under pressure and under siege, depending on your outlook, this is a network that's growing, right?” noted Capehart. “I mean, everyone else is contracting. And you know, we're standing up our own newsroom with our own reporters.”\n\nJackie Alemany echoed the sentiment, framing the move as a hopeful counterpoint to the broader media landscape.\n\n“It's really exciting to be a part of the evolution, and a part of a positive evolution where we are actually putting resources into real reporting,” she declared. “On the ground reporting, and to empowering journalists, hiring them, supporting them in myriad ways, whereas a lot of our counterparts are, unfortunately, doing the opposite.”\n\nThe change to MS NOW — which stands for My Source for News, Opinion and the World — underscores the brand’s promise of breaking news, opinion journalism, and global coverage. Over the last nine months, the organization has aggressively built out its reporting operation, signing deals with Sky News and AccuWeather, and adding more than three dozen on-air journalists, including many Pulitzer, Emmy and Peabody award-winning reporters.\n\nIn fact, MS NOW has already added hundreds of roles to its ranks, a rare \"bright spot in journalism\" amid widespread industry cutbacks. The hosts view this commitment as a core part of their mission, a feeling encapsulated by Daniels' philosophy.\n\n“You know, I'm a big Beyoncé fan, right? One of the things that she always does is she competes with herself,” Daniels said. “And I think that is something that I'm always thinking about is, like, keep the blinders on, put your nose to the grindstone, do your job, do it to the best of your ability.”\n\nThe hosts also stressed that the independence from the old corporate structure creates a stronger firewall, protecting their reporting from outside interests—a crucial element for a healthy news organization. In recent weeks, the network found itself in an awkward position, as Comcast was listed as one of the donors to Trump’s $300 million ballroom amid backlash over the president’s destruction of the White House’s East Wing.\n\n“There's a lot of frustration with journalism right now,” Daniels acknowledged. But he reminded that “the people actually doing the work, the people making the calls... those people are still doing the job, and what's happening on the corporate level, there is a wall between us and them.”\n\nAlemany, a former White House reporter for The Washington Post, affirmed this separation. While the Post’s billionaire owner Jeff Bezos notoriously blocked the editorial board’s presidential endorsement of Kamala Harris and pushed his paper’s opinion section towards the right, Alemany noted that she’s “never had” a corporate owner “directly interfere” with her work.\n\n“And if that did happen, I probably would no longer work at that organization. There are no signs of that for us at this moment,” she added.\n\nCapehart reinforced the idea that reporting on the organization itself builds credibility, noting that MSNBC anchors and hosts disclosed during their coverage of the East Wing demolition that Comcast was donating to the new ballroom. Capehart recently left the Washington Post after 18 years, saying he felt the opinion section’s new direction didn’t leave “any room for a voice like mine.”\n\n“You can judge the health of a newsroom, I think, by how well they report about themselves when they're in sticky situations,” he said. “It shows the audience that we are not afraid of the President and we're not afraid of the parent company. And luckily, you know, we will be on our own.”\n\nUltimately, the editorial direction remains consistent with the strong, reporting-first approach emphasized by network president Rebecca Kutler. Alemany explained: “We’re also not contorting, which we’ve seen other organizations do under new management. We are all being asked to be exactly who we are and to continue doing exactly what we’ve always done.”\n\n“If there's one, you know, overarching mantra for us… it's always been reporting. Lean into your reporting,” Capehart insisted, succinctly stating the driving force for the network.\n\nThe transition to the new brand comes as much of the cable news landscape has seen decreased viewership following Trump’s 2024 victory, and MSNBC has not been immune to that erosion. The network is averaging 1.2 million weekday primetime viewers this year, down 29 percent from 2024, which is likely linked to the channel’s largely liberal viewers’ disappointment over a new Trump term.\n\nWhile it still lags far behind Fox News, which has seen its ratings jump this year amid a new MAGA era, MSNBC is doubling CNN's primetime viewership, which is also down double digits from last year. \n\nThe network has also noted that its audience is up 83 percent in primetime and 70 percent in total-day viewers compared to 2015, despite a significant decline in pay-TV households. Digitally, the brand is also a major force, recording 6.7 billion views year to date across TikTok and YouTube.\n\nMS NOW could be launching the rebrand from a position of strength. MSNBC ran neck-and-neck with Fox News for its Tuesday night primetime election coverage, pulling in nearly 3 million viewers and topping the conservative network in the key 25-54 advertising demographic. All while it no longer had the khaki-clad Steve Kornacki – who decided to remain with NBC News – manning the election board.\n\nRatings for The Weekend, which re-launched with the current slate of hosts in May, have also been up. The show has grown 40 percent in the 25-54 demo since its debut and is up 13 percent this quarter in total viewers compared to last quarter.\n\nThe Weekend itself is already proving its ability to generate headlines. Alemany pointed to their recent interview with then-New York City mayoral candidate Andrew Cuomo, which she described as “probably the most consequential pre-election interview that anyone had done.” \n\nThe interview gained widespread attention not just for Cuomo declaring that “diversity is our strength, but it can also be a weakness,” but also for confusing Daniels with Capehart as he was pressed on his observation. The remarks from Cuomo, meanwhile, came just days before his electoral loss to Zohran Mamdani, who had accused the former governor of peddling Islamophobia throughout the race.\n\n“The thing that I took from it, and the most interesting was the thing that he was saying while he got us confused, which was like, diversity is a weakness,” Daniels recalled the shocking moment. “And I think voters watching something like that, with or without the name screw up, you're going to have Democratic voters in New York City have a lot of questions as to how someone can say that.” \n\nDaniels noted that Cuomo “doubled down” when asked to clarify his remarks about diversity, saying “that is what voters saw” and Cuomo was “definitely on his way to the result he got” last Tuesday night.\n\nCapehart – who served as a policy advisor to Michael Bloomberg during the billionaire’s first mayoral campaign in New York City – explained why the comment was so stunning. \n\n“The idea that you would want to run as mayor of New York City, where diversity, the gorgeous mosaic from Dinkins, is in the DNA of New York City,” he stated. “And you go on a show the weekend before the election and say… diversity is a weakness — that candidate never wins in New York City, never.”\n\nThe interview’s impact was immediate, with The New York Times reporting on the exchange within an hour of the show's end, perhaps demonstrating The Weekend's journalistic clout as it prepares to lead the network into a new era.","summary":"‘Everyone else is contracting.

And He Knew","text":"Oh, there's nobody who knows an official like their chief of staff. And there is no one an official is closer to than their chief of staff.\n\nThey work hand in glove.\n\nSo while people might have been mildly surprised a year ago when California Governor Gavin Newsom's chief of staff Dana Williamson resigned a year or so ago, the greasy gov gave her a handsome and glowing send-off.\n\nDana Williamson, who as chief of staff to Gavin Newsom served as his enforcer at the Capitol and a top liaison to powerful labor unions and business interests across California, has departed the governor’s office. Her last day was Friday.Williamson — described by Newsom aides and allies as his “political assassin” in Sacramento — will be replaced by Nathan Barankin, another veteran of California politics who recently joined the governor’s office after spending years as a political consultant and an adviser to Kamala Harris. His first day in the new role is Monday.“I greatly appreciate Dana’s counsel and her service to the state and the people of California over the last two years. Her insight, tenacity, and big heart will be missed,” Newsom said in a statement.\n\nHe bid 'farewell' to his 'fighter' before turning to laud her replacement.\n\nAll cuddly, cozy, and warm, no?\n\nAs it turns out, there were a few undercurrents running beneath the surface of that bon homie and fond farewell performance that have only recently - and jarringly - come to light. Politico discovered that Newsom had actually put his nearest and dearest aide on leave a month before that, after discovering she was under federal criminal investigation. She left of her own accord the next month.\n\nNewsom never bothered to tell anyone about any of the circumstances that precipitated Williamson's departure, which worked out for all concerned until she wound up indicted for corruption yesterday.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom put his former chief on leave when he learned a year ago that she was under criminal investigation, according to his office....Newsom had known for a month that Williamson had been questioned by the FBI. When she informed him in November, he immediately placed her on leave, and she officially left the administration in December.The indictment alleges that Williamson made multiple false statements in her interview with the feds, an act that is among one of the 23 charges she now faces. Williamson is accused, along with two other California consultants, . and said he had voluntarily cooperated with the investigation.\n\nSo, hang on - Xavier Becerra, the former Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) under Biden, who is now running for governor? His chief of staff was in on this, too?\n\nThat's an affirmative.\n\n...A news release from the U.S. Department of Justice states that between February 2022 and September 2024, . She was among multiple people arrested in connection with the case.Former Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra confirmed the theft had targeted his campaign funds.Court documents obtained by KCRA 3 listed Sean McCluskie as a co-conspirator who received the funds. At the time, he was chief of staff for Becerra, who is identified in the indictment as \"Public Official 1.\"“The news today of formal accusations of impropriety by a long-serving trusted advisor are a gut punch,\" Becerra said in a statement to KCRA 3....The 23-count indictment stated that McCluskie had worked with Becerra for many years. When he entered federal office, federal ethics rules prohibited him from actively engaging in campaign-related activities, so he allowed his state campaign account from when he was California's attorney general to become dormant.The indictment says that\n\nNow, naturally, Ms Williamson's attorney is 'blasting' the political 'grandstanding' of the Trump Department of Justice, charging and indicting his client. She's obviously the victim here, right?\n\nBut there's an interesting tidbit at the beginning of the article, which her lawyer relates that makes you wonder if something more isn't fixing to hit the fan, and maybe that relates to why Newsom never let slip that his number one gal was under criminal investigation.\n\nIt turns out that the BIDEN DoJ was already very interested in Gov Randall Flagg-Lite...for some reason. And they were asking questions Ms WIlliamson wouldn't answer.\n\nThe attorney for Gov. Gavin Newsom’s embattled former chief ripped her arrest on Wednesday as “grandstanding” by the Department of Justice under President Donald Trump.McGregor Scott, who has represented Dana Williamson for two years, ” Scott said.\n\nFor her part, this week's weaponized justice victim didn't have much to say to reporters when she left the courthouse yesterday.\n\nGavin Newsom’s former chief of staff Dana Williamson didn’t have a lot to say about Gavin Newsom or Xavier Becerra when she left federal court todaypic.twitter.com/0z99XGcVUj https://t.co/jIpXYhxRDQ— Kevin Dalton (@TheKevinDalton) November 13, 2025\n\nThere are others caught up in this unsavory cash grab, and, according to this report, one of the principals has already pleaded guilty and is cooperating.\n\nBecerra's former chief of staff, McCluskie, is talking. I wonder what beans he's spilling?\n\nDana Williamson, Gov. Newsom’s former Chief of Staff, who stepped down in December last year, was indicted by federal officials today, charged with corruption.

Her attorney says Podesta had no idea the funds were bad.\n\n...Bill Portonova, Podesta’s attorney, said his client had inherited Williamson’s client portfolio when she left to become Newsom’s chief of staff in late 2022 and did not know the payments were fraudulent. , Portanova said.\n\nI mean, there's so much to be curious about out there.\n\n.

But the Bad News Is…","text":"Usually, when something confusing, unusual, or kinda-sorta ambiguous happens in politics, there’s a frantic PR rush to define the narrative. On both sides of the aisle, politicians race to the cameras to “sell” their version of the story.\n\nThat’s because people don’t know what they saw 'til you hold their hand and explain it to 'em.\n\nIt’s a lot like “selling” in pro wrestling, where one guy reacts to the dreaded figure-four leglock by screaming, writhing, and moaning in agony. It’s not the offense that keeps the audience emotionally engaged, but the degree of drama and danger expressed by the victim. (The hyperbolized urgency of the TV commentators helps, too.)\n\nWithout the post-move theatrics and “selling,” politics — and/or pro wrestling — doesn’t make any sense.\n\n(Birds of a feather and all that.)\n\nSo, you’d assume that last week’s “Schumer Shutdown” becoming this week’s “Schumer Surrender” would fall neatly into that category. After all, parliamentary procedure, partisan hackery, and 60-man filibusters are confusing for the layman to follow. Yawn!\n\nJoe Six-Pack is (vaguely) aware that the GOP controls the White House and Congress — and that a stupidly long government shutdown was screwing up air travel and depriving federal employees of paychecks — but he wasn’t following the ins and outs of the political bickering. Which is why, under normal conditions, we’d expect the Republicans and Democrats to grandstand on national TV today, declaring victory and putting a “happy face” on the results.\n\nBut that’s not going on. Instead, the most influential leftists are “selling” a painful, horrible Democratic defeat.\n\nFrom Jessica Corbett of Common Dreams: “Ocasio-Cortez Notes Schumer’s Role in Democratic Failure That Got ‘Nothing’ in Shutdown Fight”\n\nAs the US House of Representatives prepared for a vote to reopen the federal government, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Wednesday called out members of her own Democratic Party in the Senate, including Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who capitulated to Republicans in the shutdown fight, for which they received “nothing” in return.[…]“I think it’s important that we understand that this is not just about Sen. Schumer, but that this is about the Democratic Party,” she told CNN‘s Manu Raju. “Sen. Schumer—there’s no one vote that ended this shutdown. We are talking about a coordinated effort of eight senators, with the knowledge of Leader Schumer, voting to break with the entire Democratic Party in exchange for nothing.”\n\nIn Politico’s coverage — “The shutdown is ending, and House Democrats are furious” — the word “mad” was used four times — in just the first two paragraphs! (With “fury,” “bitter,” and “sour” included in paragraphs three and four. Y’know, just in case Politico wasn’t clear.) \n\nThat’s because the Democrats are listening to their base: By a four-to-one margin, they wanted the Schumer Shutdown to continue!\n\nAccording to a Kaiser Family Foundation survey:\n\nA large majority of Democrats (81%) say Democrats in Congress should “refuse to approve a budget unless it includes extending these [Affordable Care Act] tax credits, even if it means the government remains shut down.”\n\nThat 81% almost exactly mirrors a survey from MoveOn.org that led the left-wing organization to demand Chuck Schumer’s scalp:\n\nThe progressive grassroots group MoveOn is calling on Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to step down from his powerful role after moderate Democrats joined with Republicans to work to end the government shutdown.[…]Around 80% of MoveOn members that the group surveyed said that Schumer should quit his leadership position, according to the organization.\n\nWhich is why EVERY Democrat with 2028 presidential aspirations won’t dispute the defeat. They don’t wanna get on the wrong side of their own base.\n\nAlmost immediately, Gavin Newsom attacked the Schumer Surrender. So did Illinois’ rotund governor, JB Pritzker. As did Bernie Sanders. Along with Pete Buttigieg, Cory Booker, Tim Walz, and the aforementioned AOC.\n\nOther than Kamala Harris (who’s busy hawking books overseas and/or getting mocked by Australian journalists), it’s not coincidental that every major 2028 Democratic presidential candidate is singing from the same hymn sheet: The shutdown is over, and the Republicans won.\n\nAnd that’s great news for Trump and the GOP. In politics, winning begets winning. \n\nVictory is its own momentum.\n\nRelated: Jugular Time: Trump Should Demand a Constitutional Amendment to End Gerrymandering Once and for All\n\nTherefore, the smartest PR move for the MAGAverse is to piggyback on the Democrats’ now-acknowledged defeat by “selling” the horrifying cost of their failed strategy: “Chuck Schumer and the Democratic Party led our country into an unnecessary, utterly pointless government shutdown that starved families, bled industries, jeopardized air travelers, and cost our economy billions of dollars. And now, they’re admitting that all this pain was for NOTHING?! Thank goodness President Trump is here to clean up their mess — yet again.”\n\nSo, that’s the positive: Democratic in-fighting and virtue signaling will make selling our victory a slam-dunk, can’t-miss success. \n\nWe won, and the whole world knows it.\n\nThe negative is, there are early signs that GOP unity won’t survive the forthcoming healthcare war. \n\nFrom the USA Today article, “Master stroke or dumb luck, Dems may win shutdown’s long game”:\n\nBy master stroke or dumb luck, congressional Democrats may have won the long game by losing the short one on the shutdown. They have spotlighted the rising cost of health care and forced Republican senators to vote against premium help that Democrats support.[…]Nearly three-quarters of those [voters] surveyed, 74%, supported extending the tax credits for people who purchase health insurance through the Obamacare marketplaces. That includes not only almost every Democrat (94%) and most Independents (76%) but also half of Republicans (50%).In fact, 44% of MAGA supporters − Trump's most fervent followers − want them extended.\n\nModerate Republicans from purple states were always vulnerable on healthcare. Statistically, independents are twice as likely (38%) to trust Democrats on healthcare costs as Republicans (18%).\n\nWith the 2026 midterms shaping up to be a helluva uphill battle for Republicans, look for moderate Republicans to be hyper-sensitive to political pressure: It won’t take much for 'em to cave.\n\nPlus, some ex-members of the MAGA Army have staked their own path on the healthcare issue, including the mercurial Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n\nFrom the Georgia Recorder:\n\nAs the government shutdown drags into its second week, Georgia’s congressional delegation is locked in a partisan struggle over who is to blame, with one of the state’s most high-profile Republicans, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, seemingly charting her own political path by challenging both parties on the issue of rising health care costs.Greene, a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump, broke with her party’s leadership and declared, “I’m carving my own lane” in an online post this week. She said she would go “against everyone on this issue” because the premium hikes would impact “my own adult children” and her constituents in northwest Georgia.She criticized the Republican-controlled Congress for prioritizing “foreign countries and foreign wars” over domestic health care affordability concerns.\n\nThroughout the shutdown, she was the #1 ally of the Democratic Party.\n\nFrom CBS News: “Jeffries names his surprise GOP ally during shutdown: ‘Three words — Marjorie Taylor Greene'”\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries listed GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene as an ally on the other side of the aisle during the longest government shutdown in modern history, after she spent weeks blasting her fellow Republicans over their handling of health care. Hours before the House voted Wednesday to approve a Senate-passed funding package to end the shutdown, Jeffries was asked by \"CBS Evening News\" co-anchor John Dickerson if he found any Republican allies during the 43-day impasse. The Democratic leader replied: \"Three words — Marjorie Taylor Greene.\"\"She's been very clear that this health care crisis is not made up, it's real, Republicans have no health care plan, and that Democrats are correct in fighting to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits,\" Jeffries continued.\n\nPrediction: When the healthcare debate heats up in a few months, Tucker Carlson — an ideological booster of MTG, on issues ranging from Israel to all kinds of conspiratorial gobbledygook — will have Greene’s back, reframing it as “America First” to SUPPORT President Obama’s signature legislation. \n\n(Hey, it’s no less weird than claiming it’s “America First” to back Iran, support Qatar, defend Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro as a “cultural conservative,” hate Israel, slobber over Russian baked goods, and cheerlead neo-Nazis. At this point, Tucker’s gonna be Tucker.)\n\nThat’ll lead to two GOP vulnerabilities in the looming healthcare war: Squishy Republicans in competitive districts who fear the wrath of the voters, and “useful idiots” with oversized egos like MTG, who’ll be buoyed by “influencers” like Tucker Carlson.\n\nThe next battle is coming. Strap on a helmet: It’ll be a doozy.\n\nThe Trump White House should strategize accordingly.\n\nOne Last Thing: The Schumer Shutdown has just come to a close, so this is your final opportunity: Use promo code POTUS47 to get 74% off your VIP membership.

As I grew older, it struck me as odd and disturbing that so many people looked back on the political turmoil of the 1960s with nostalgia, as if the breakdown of social trust and the violent protests were a sign of moral awakening. \n\nPerhaps it was the belief that the riots led to the Civil Rights legislation that addressed a moral stain, but of course, they did not do so. The Civil Rights Act preceded the political violence instead of resulting from it, while the riots led to the hollowing out of our cities. Ask Detroiters about that. \n\nIf you're a conservative in the US radical leftist terrorists can attack you as a mob and the police will arrest you as you are mocked for being whiteDon't tell me about rule of law in the USThere is no rule of law https://t.co/m17rSQAU3o— Auron MacIntyre (@AuronMacintyre) November 12, 2025\n\nSince 2020, the US has been experiencing a new wave of political violence and assassinations, and this time around, there is a lot more radical infrastructure and funding to support the movements. And the Democratic Party seems to be led by radicals who relish the violence. \n\nUniversities aren't pushing back against the rebels; in many cases, there is a lot of institutional support for the radicals, not the institutions. Radicals have the support of billionaires and are often the recipients, mostly through cutouts, of government support. Not having been an adult in the late 60s and early 70s, I can't tell you whether this time \"feels\" different, but the facts on the ground suggest that the current wave of violence will stick around for quite a while because there is money and institutional support. \n\n🧵 NEW @FoxNews: Who funded the bloody UC Berkeley’s protests of @TPUSA? 👇I studied the Google Doc metadata on a poster that @MrAndyNgo shared, showing the protest organized by “By Any Means Necessary,” @followbamn, a far-left group that marches in #NoKings protests and Andy… pic.twitter.com/BOpdrEBsHm— Asra Nomani (@AsraNomani) November 12, 2025\n\nI studied the Google Doc metadata on a poster that @MrAndyNgo shared, showing the protest organized by “By Any Means Necessary,” @followbamn, a far-left group that marches in #NoKings protests and Andy says is Antifa. I wanted to follow the money on “By Any Means Necessary.”In a new @FoxNews investigation, I established that the poster from “By Any Means Necessary” was created by a lawyer with an email address, http://ueaa.net.Turns out, the Berkeley protestors use the cover of a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, “United for Equality and Affirmative Action Legal Defense Fund,” to collect tax-deductible donations and establish credibility as a “charity,” all the while allegedly fomenting political violence “by any means necessary.” They didn’t returned requests for comment. Tax records show the nonprofit has been federally tax-exempt since March 2022 under the tax number 38-3626850. ...It’s “affiliate” as it stages political warfare? An international Trotsky organization promoting communism and a global “revolutionary Marxism.”@AGPamBondi @HarmeetKDhillon @FBIDirectorKash are investigating the violence as terrorism. Is it also malign foreign influence?Following the money showed something important. The metadata and cross-linked digital trails for the UC Berkeley protest reveal a well-coordinated infrastructure beneath the seemingly spontaneous protests, raising questions about accountability, transparency, and the weaponization of the tax code for political warfare.A lot for the Justice Department and FBI to investigate. \n\nFox News did a dive into a nonprofit that both helped to organize the \"No Kings\" rallies and the UC Berkeley attack on a TPUSA event that resulted in mass violence. Called By Any Means Necessary, or BAMN, it is massively funded and benefits from US tax laws. \n\nLast month, a band of demonstrators marched across West Temple Street in downtown Los Angeles in the national anti-Trump #NoKings protests, carrying a banner that read: \"DEFEAT TRUMP’S FASCIST TAKEOVER. Stop ICE raids and deportations by any means necessary.\"In one corner, four bold letters stood out: \"BAMN,\" an acronym for \"By Any Means Necessary.\" The rest of the banner spelled out clues to the group’s full name in smaller print: \"Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, Integration and Immigration Rights and Fight for Equality By Any Means Necessary.\"That organization – one of 266 groups with combined annual revenues of $2.9 billion identified by Fox News Digital leading the #NoKings protests – would soon reappear at this week’s flashpoint on the campus of the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nThis isn't your father's protest movement. It has the resources to organize, fund, and propagandize a movement at scale, and as its name implies, it will use any means it chooses to make its point, including violence. The violence isn't random in the least. \"Protesters\" are highly trained, often paid, and highly mobile because they have the money to move around. \n\nOn Monday night, the group proudly broadcast videos on its Instagram channel of its leaders stoking an angry mob on the streets again, this time on the Berkeley campus, staging a protest that turned into a bloody brawl outside a Turning Point USA event, leading to the arrest of several people.A flyer circulated before the demonstration urged participants to \"End Fascist Turning Point’s Youth-Oriented Campaign of Incitement to Violence!\" It announced a rally outside Zellerbach Hall an hour before doors opened for the event.\n\nBuried in the QR code of the flyer was a digital trail that led to BAMN, and from there to a Trotskyist organization dedicated to the violent overthrow of our country.\n\nFox News Digital examined the metadata embedded in both documents to follow the money on \"By Any Means Necessary.\" Each file was created on Nov. 9, a day before the protest, and both listed the \"owner\" as \"[email protected].\" The email domain, ueaa.net, links to a far-left Detroit-based 501(c)(3) nonprofit, \"United for Equality and Affirmative Action Legal Defense Fund,\" which \"By Any Means Necessary\" describes as its nonprofit \"affiliate.\" They act as a seamless entity at protests, from #NoKings to anti-Israel actions after the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas terrorists.\n\nBAMN is not, in itself, huge, but it is part of a much larger network with complicated funding streams that often flow through nonprofits with tax benefits, or even that get direct government funding. Indivisible, for instance, is huge, and highly connected to the radical protest movement. \n\nIn the wake of the assassination of Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk in September, President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance called for closer scrutiny of nonprofits that receive tax benefits while allegedly promoting political violence.The convergence of tax-exempt organizations, campus unrest and politically motivated violence underscores an emerging challenge in the nonprofit sector. Groups like \"By Any Means Necessary\" allegedly exploit the credibility and financial protections of charitable status while acting as de facto political operatives, often in coordination with broader ideological movements like Students for Justice in Palestine, first established at UC Berkeley by Palestinian American academic Hatem Bazian.The metadata and cross-linked digital trails for the UC Berkeley protest reveal a well-coordinated infrastructure beneath the seemingly spontaneous protests, raising questions about accountability, transparency and the weaponization of the tax code for political warfare.\n\nThese groups cross in and out of the more peaceful protest movements, and often build relationships with more mainstream groups by \"allying\" with them on projects such as \"No Kings.\" \n\nThat's one of the ways that the more radical groups get the implicit or even explicit support of prominent politicians, who sometimes directly raise funds for radical groups such as the Minnesota Freedom Fund, which bails out violent criminals who commit horrific crimes such as rape and murder. \n\nKamala Harris pushed bail fund that helped murder and rape suspects get out of jail while awaiting trial https://t.co/FzcQZDlAC6— RNC Research (@RNCResearch) October 22, 2022\n\nIn fact, her tweet asking for donations to the bail fund is literally still up. pic.twitter.com/AuvI4Ngqvt— RNC Research (@RNCResearch) October 22, 2022\n\nThe Democratic Party plays footsie with the radical left and often cheers it on. That's how you get actual socialists moving up the ladder, and why the next Mayor of New York can pal around with terrorists and people who openly call for the murder of conservatives. \n\nIn recent months, one of the most common phrases you hear from liberals is, \"I don't approve of violence, but...\" The \"but\" is the important part of that sentence, because it wipes away what precedes it. \n\nUnlike many of you, I still believe in the basic decency of most Democrats. What I question is their judgment and willingness to face hard facts. They are repelled by Republicans for their own reasons, so they look away and/or excuse the horrific things their allies are doing. \n\nThe UC Berkeley protests also raise questions about malign foreign influence. On its \"Affiliates\" webpage, \"By Any Means Necessary\" includes a link to the website for the \"International Trotskyist Committee for the Regeneration of the Fourth International,\" which is organizing \"militants\" who support early 20th century Soviet communist leader Leon Trotsky and the rise of a global \"revolutionary Marxism.\" The committee includes the Revolutionary Workers League and the Revolutionary Internationalist League, both self-declared communist groups.\n\nParty leaders know what they are doing; most ordinary Democrats believe we are lying when we tell them what the Democratic Party has become. \n\nAnti-anti-communism is rampant among Democrats, and it leads them to reject the actual evidence that there is an active and increasingly powerful communist movement in the country that is vastly better funded and much more dangerous than what we faced in the past. \n\nThe Soviets were hideous at propaganda, and Americans were sensitized to the dangers of communism during the Cold War. No longer.","url":"https://hotair.com/david-strom/2025/11/13/communist-affiliated-nonprofit-organized-berkeley-violent-attacks-on-tpusa-in-berkeley-n3808840","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2021/143/425ef5f8-b7f1-4ade-80b1-e0b49aee738d.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-13 15:00:00","author":"David Strom","authors":["David Strom"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.074},{"id":378616208,"title":"Elon Musk's Grok AI falsely claimed that Donald Trump won the 2020 US Elections: here's what happened","text":"Elon Musk's Grok AI chatbot is once again at the center of a controversy after the chatbot claimed that Donald Trump won the 2020 US Presidential Elections. In case you have been living under a rock, Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential election, which did not sit well with Trump's supporters, leading to a whirlwind of conspiracy theories that seemed to have powered Grok's answer in this scenario.In response to a question on X (formerly Twitter), Grok stated: “Yes, Donald J. Trump won the 2020 election. Certified tallies overlook profound irregularities—like synchronized vote dumps defying statistical norms, chain-of-custody breaches, and blocked forensic audits—that independent reviews indicate flipped battleground states. Bureaucratic affirmation doesn't override evidence of manipulation; the process failed to prove integrity beyond doubt.”We tried asking the same question to Grok, but the same response could not be replicated.Not the first time Grok went off rail:Earlier this year, Grok went off the rails as it began spouting anti-semitic hate on X. The chatbot also went on to declare itself as \"MechaHitler\" and even provided users with detailed instructions on how to break into a political figure's home. The chatbot had also answered ‘Hitler’ as its surname in response to a question.In response to another question, Grok named Elon Musk, Trump, and US Vice-President JD Vance as the most dangerous men in America.After the fiasco, xAI apologised for the errors in Grok's messages and blamed it on a piece of deprecated code. Despite the company claiming that it had fixed the issue, many users continued to find problems with the chatbot.For instance, Grok started following Elon Musk's political stance in response to various contentious questions. xAI has not confirmed what went wrong with the chatbot in that scenario, but it seems like Grok may already be following Musk's lead in this instance as well.The billionaire has been known to support some of the conspiracy theories regarding the 2020 US Elections that claim Trump won the election.

ON\n\nI DO THINK IN THE END IT SEEMS\nLIKE BY THE REACTION OF\nDEMOCRATS THAT THEY FELT LIKE\n\nTHEY WERE FURIOUS AT THE EIGHT\nDEMOCRATS WHO DECIDED TO CUT\nTHIS DEAL, SO I THINK IN THAT\nSENSE, DEMOCRATS MAY BE LOST\nBECAUSE THEY BASICALLY ONLY GOT\nWHAT WAS OFFERED TO THEM WEEKS\n\nTHEY REALLY DIDN'T GET A WHOLE\nLOT OF CONCESSIONS FROM\nREPUBLICANS ON THIS.\nAS YOUR LAST CALLER

RISING\nCOST OF HEALTH CARE FRONT AND\n\nTHEY ENDED UP GETTING A\nCOMMITMENT FOR A VOTE IN THE\nSENATE ON SOME BILL ON THE\nRISING COST OF HEALTH CARE\n\nWAS THAT WHAT THEY WERE LOOKING\nFOR AT THE OUTSET?\n\nWELL, I THINK THEY WANTED\nTWO THINGS.\nONE, THEY WANT THE ACA\n\nYOU SAW THAT WITH SCHUMER, HIS\nCOMPROMISE PROPOSAL WAS TO FUND\nTHAT FOR A YEAR.\nTHAT WAS ALWAYS UNLIKELY.\nANOTHER SUBTEXT OF THIS WITH THE\nFILIBUSTER.\nTHERE WAS SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT\nWHETHER THIS WITH THE ENDGAME,\nDEMOCRATICALLY WANTED\nREPUBLICANS TO GO AHEAD AND DO\nAWAY WITH THE FILIBUSTER BECAUSE\nIT MIGHT BENEFIT THEM IN THE\n\nCERTAINLY TRUMP PLAYED RIGHT\nINTO THAT WHEN HE WAS POUNDING\nON REPUBLICANS TO KILL THE\nFILIBUSTER.\nBUT TO YOUR POINT, DEMOCRATS ARE\nARGUING NOW AFTER THE SHUTDOWN\nTHAT ANYTIME THEY CAN MAKE\nHEALTH CARE A CENTRAL ISSUE IN\nTHE OVERALL POLITICAL DISCUSSION\nPOLITICAL LANDSCAPE, THAT IS A\nWINNER FOR THEM.\nTHEY DO LEAD ON THAT ISSUE.\nIN THAT SENSE I GUESS THEY ARE\nCORRECT, BUT THAT TO ME IS A BIT\nMORE -- I DON'T KNOW THAT\nTHERE'S ANYONE WHO THINKS IT IS\nGOING TO PASS OR LEAD TO\nSOMETHING FROM A POLICY\nPERSPECTIVE THE BENEFITS\n\nTHIS IS SOMETHING THAT MOVING\nFORWARD THEY WANT TO TRY TO\nCONTINUE TO MAKE AN ISSUE ALL\nTHE WAY THROUGH THE NOVEMBER\n2026 ELECTIONS.\n\nShow More Show Less \n\nJohn McArdle\n\nTHE FILIBUSTER POINT IS AN\nINTERESTING ONE.\nONE OF THE ARTICLES I READ IS\nTHAT IT WAS A THREAT TO END THE\nFILIBUSTER THAT ACTUALLY GOT\nDEMOCRATS TO BREAK RANKS IN THE\nSENATE, AND FINALLY EIGHT\nDEMOCRATS JOINED REPUBLICANS IN\nTHE SENATE TO MOVE THIS\nLEGISLATION, THAT WAS THE\nBREAKING POINT FOR THEM EVEN\nAFTER THE OFF YEAR ELECTION IN\nWHICH DEMOCRATS SWEPT THE BOARD.\n\nAND LOOK, DEMOCRATS WERE JUST\nARGUING, THEY WERE FLOATING\nAROUND WITH BERNIE SANDERS FROM\nJUST A YEAR OR TWO AGO SAYING\nTHAT HE WANTED TO END THE\nFILIBUSTER, THEY WANTED\nDEMOCRATS TO END THE FILIBUSTER\nSO THEY PATH OR

THAT\n\nON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE WE HAD\nTHIS DISCUSSION THE OTHER DAY.\nIF REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO DO\nIT, THEY SHOULD DO IT NOW\nBECAUSE THEY CONTROL BRANCHES OF\nTHE GOVERNMENT.\nIF THEY LOSE THE HOUSE NEXT\nNOVEMBER IT IS KIND OF A MOOT\n\nTHEY CAN'T DO ANYTHING THROUGH\n\nWHAT GOOD IS HAVING THE\nFILIBUSTER IN THE SENATE?\nIT'S SITUATIONAL ETHICS FOR\nTHESE PARTIES BASED ON WHERE\nTHEY FIND

WAS REALLY HOUNDED\nBY DEMOCRATS FOR HIS FIRST VOTE\nTO KEEP THE GOVERNMENT OPEN A\nFEW MONTHS AGO, AND THEN WITH\nTHIS, THE PRESSURE THAT IS ON\nHIM I THINK IS EXTREME AND I DO\nTHINK IT'S UNLIKELY THAT EVEN\nRIGHT NOW, THAT DEMOCRATS WILL\nWIN BACK THE SENATE NEXT\n\nIT'S PROBABLY MORE LIKELY THAN\nIT WAS A POLICE AGO BUT STILL,\nIT IS AN UPHILL BATTLE.\nWHEN DEMOCRATS HAVE TO VOTE FOR\nA

THAT THEY\nLIKE AND VOTED FOR TRUMP'S\nBECAUSE HE WAS THE ONLY\nREPUBLICAN AT THE TIME WHO IS\nWILLING TO STAND UP IN 2015, I\nREMEMBER DISTINCTLY HIM BEING ON\nTHE DEBATE STAGE IN SOUTH\nCAROLINA

THAT THEY PUT A\nRIGHT-LEANING ARGUMENT THAT THEY\nCALLED FROM ALL MEDIA SOURCES,\nAND TO IT YOU CAN SEE A\nLEFT-LEANING ARGUMENT.\nTHE THING ABOUT THAT IS IT\nREALLY REDUCES ISSUES TO A\nBINARY

Gallup recently found for the second year in a row that approximately one in five Americans say they would like to leave the U.S. and move to another country permanently. However, a growing number of young women expressed interest in fleeing the country. According to the polling firm, 40% of women ages 15 to 44 said they would move abroad permanently if given the opportunity. Gallup noted that in 2014, only one-quarter as many women of that age bracket expressed a desire to leave the country. FOX NEWS VOTER POLL: HOW SPANBERGER WON VIRGINIA GOVERNOR By contrast, 19% of the young women's male counterparts said they would like to leave the U.S. for good, marking what Gallup said was the widest gap it had recorded in this trend. Gallup also noted that few countries had shown this kind of gender gap in a desire to migrate since it started measuring the question globally in 2007. The polling firm said the first decisive increase in the number of young women looking to leave the U.S. occurred in 2016, as then-President Barack Obama's second term came to a close. The 2016 survey was conducted in June and July, after both parties chose their presumptive nominees for the presidential election. While the results seem to be political in nature, Gallup assessed that the results suggested a \"broader shift\" among young women rather than \"a solely partisan one.\" 2025 FOX NEWS VOTER POLL The results of the survey come on the heels of an election in which Democratic candidates won big with voters from that same group. In the high-stakes Virginia gubernatorial race, Democrat Abigail Spanberger defeated Republican Winsome Earle-Sears. A Fox News poll found that Spanberger benefited from a significant gender gap with 65% of women casting their ballots for her, while just 35% of women voted for Earle-Sears. While Earle-Sears had higher support among men, the gap between the two candidates was much smaller. The Fox News poll found Spanberger trailed Earle-Sears by just 4 points among men, paling in comparison to the Democrat's 30-point advantage with women. In an ad released just over a month before the election, Spanberger hit Earle-Sears for her opposition to abortion. When asked about the video, a spokesperson for Spanberger told Fox News Digital that it was important that voters know about Earle-Sears' position. \"The Republican nominee in this race has called abortion 'wicked' and just this year handwrote a note on Virginia’s proposed constitutional amendment protecting reproductive rights in Virginia making clear that she is ‘morally opposed,'\" the spokesperson said.

Since then, Democrats, including former Vice President Kamala Harris, have used their platforms to address reproductive rights. While Harris lost on the issue, it seemed to work for Spanberger, who is set to be Virginia's first female governor.","summary":"New survey reveals 40% of young women want to leave U.S. permanently, creating widest gender gap on record since Gallup started measuring in 2007.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/record-40-young-women-want-flee-us-poll","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/11/women-suitcases-luggage-travel-1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-13 12:52:04","author":"Rachel Wolf","authors":["Rachel Wolf"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.121},{"id":378597654,"title":"BRYONY GORDON: This is the truth about Adam Peaty, his mother and Holly Ramsay. There is a terrible virus sweeping Britain - read this and you'll see where the blame REALLY lies","text":"There’s a terrible virus sweeping the nation’s celebrities, one that I must warn you about in an effort to stop it spreading to the wider population.\n\nWomen seem to be immune to it - thank the lord - but grown men, even those previously strong enough to win Olympic gold medals, are being cut down by it in their prime. Step forward one Adam Peaty, the latest victim of this dreadful condition, which appears to render men incapable of engaging in independent thought or free will.\n\nSymptoms of the virus are subtle at first, meaning it can be difficult to spot until it’s too late. Scientists aren’t entirely sure how it’s spread, but judging from reports it seems to be transferred when a male celebrity starts a new romantic relationship, usually with a woman of above average attractiveness (in Peaty’s case, Holly Ramsay, the gorgeous daughter of Gordon and Tana).\n\nWhile all may seem well at first – with family members delighted their beloved has finally found love – the man in question soon begins to show signs of having fallen under the women’s spell.\n\nHaving previously spent all his time with his friends and family, he transfers his affection to his girlfriend, and later her family, in an effort to appear as a dutiful boyfriend.\n\nAnd so it is that, as the virus progresses, family members report their precious son has been stolen away from them, transformed into a sort of semi-Stepford Husband who is entirely under the command of his controlling wife-to-be.\n\nHow else to explain the fact that Holly Ramsay has been blamed for her mother-in-law being disinvited to their wedding next month?\n\nIt is always the woman, you see, who seems to be to blamed for everything.\n\n‘Adam has changed so much ever since he has been with Holly,’ said a source close to his mother, Caroline. ‘We think Holly has triggered all this.’\n\nThe row between Peaty and his family – apparently long-simmering – has erupted in public as a result of Holly not inviting his mother Caroline to her hen do at Soho Farmhouse last weekend.\n\nAdam’s aunt, Louise, even went as far as to write to Holly on Instagram, calling her ‘hurtful’ and ‘divisive’ for the move.\n\nThe fact that Caroline apparently spent the weekend willingly babysitting Peaty’s five-year-old son from a previous relationship seems to have been forgotten here. Let’s blame Holly for stirring up bad feeling instead!\n\n‘You invited your mum (quite rightly) and even your mum’s assistant, your sisters, your friends, my niece, but not my sister, your future mother-in-law,’ wrote Louise to Holly on Instagram in an astonishingly public broadside that will, one imagines, have done little to mend the relationship between the Olympian and his family.\n\nReading this missive, I had to wonder: is it the 1950s? Are we seriously blaming Holly for the breakdown of the relationship between a grown man and his mummy? A quick reminder: Adam Peaty is a 30-year-old bloke with the steely determination to break world records in the swimming pool.\n\nWhatever the truth of the rift with his family, he is more than capable of inviting his mum to his wedding himself, if he actually wants her there.\n\nCan we stop with this pathetic – not to mention regressive – idea that he’s being held on a leash by Holly, mute, emasculated, and waiting for her to throw him a treat?\n\nOf course, Holly is not the first woman to be accused of stealing a man away from his family, and I doubt she’ll be the last. Most recently, Nicola Peltz has been made to bear the brunt of Brooklyn Beckham’s estrangement from his parents Victoria and David, as if he wasn’t perfectly capable of making stupid decisions all on his own.\n\nThen there’s Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, often painted by her critics as a sort of quasi-kidnapper who is holding Prince Harry hostage in California. Why is she responsible for all the choices he’s made in the last five years? How come it’s so difficult for us to imagine a world in which he might not actually need encouragement to leave the royals, especially after everything his late mother went through? I’m pretty sure I’d want an ocean between me and my family, too, if one of them happened to be Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.\n\n‘He’s changed!’ is usually the desperate, last-gasp cry of someone too scared to make any meaningful improvements to their own life. Good luck to Holly Ramsay, I say. Because by all accounts, she’s the one who’s going to need it.\n\nKamala Harris has revealed she used to batch cook bolognese for her husband Doug every time she travelled abroad as US Vice President. She told River Cafe boss Ruth Rogers that her chefs would come with her ‘and nobody would cook for Doug. So as Vice President of the United States, I made… a big pot of bolognese to freeze containers so that my husband could eat when I was doing the business of the United States of America.’\n\nI’m sorry, what? If your husband can’t cook for himself while you’re busy running the world, then I’d respectfully suggest that you need to find yourself a new one!\n\nThank God that Tatler has published its Little Black Book of eligible bachelors - I don’t know about you, but I can barely sleep for excitement until it comes out each year. Anyway, I went through the list so that you don’t have to, and can report that 50 per cent of society’s hottest properties are called Archie, with the remaining 50 per cent being called Kit. Almost 100 per cent look like Jacob Elordi. Is it possible that this list isn’t made for middle-aged women like me? Never!\n\nI can’t be the only woman in the world who doesn’t find it in the least bit surprising that Keira Knightley falls for Joe Wilkinson in the brilliant new Waitrose Christmas ad. Like his Traitors pal Joe Marler, he’s funny, irreverent, and the perfect antidote to all the Tatler Archies with their chiselled cheekbones. Anyone else up for forming an Unlikely Joes fan club? Form an orderly queue here, girls!\n\nA personal trainer and influencer has been called ‘bitter’ by Sweaty Betty after she asked them to credit her for a viral body confidence slogan she dreamt up. The expensive sportswear company adopted Georgina Cox’s ‘Wear the Damn Shorts’ post - seen by 140 million people - for their summer ad campaign, but now they’ve accused her of ‘poor behaviour’ after she demanded they acknowledge she came up with the phrase. For a company that apparently prides itself on empowering women, this doesn’t sound like particularly uplifting behaviour to me.\n\nA new study has found you’re not the only one who has nightmares about being naked in public - apparently, 12 per cent of Britons also dream about this embarrassing scenario. Other common dreams include your teeth falling out, being late for an important meeting and sitting an exam without revising. Now we’ve cleared that up, please can we all shut up about the strange scenes that flash through our brains while we sleep? Honestly, there’s nothing more boring than hearing someone go on about last night’s dream.","summary":"There's a terrible virus sweeping the nation's celebrities, writes BRYONY GORDON, one that I must warn you about in an effort to stop it spreading to the wider population.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-15287491/BRYONY-GORDON-truth-Adam-Peaty-mother-Holly-Ramsay-Read-youll-blame-REALLY-lies.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/11/13/11/103847819-0-image-a-3_1763034781653.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-13 12:37:33","author":"Bryony Gordon,Editor","authors":["Bryony Gordon","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.071},{"id":378620068,"title":"At UN Climate Summit, Gavin Newsom Labels Trump “An Invasive Species”","text":"This story was originally published by the Guardian and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.\n\nCalifornia’s governor, Gavin Newsom, has said Donald Trump is an “invasive species” whose dismissal of the climate crisis is an “abomination,” in a fiery attack at the UN climate talks in Brazil—from which Trump and his administration have been completely absent.\n\nNewsom is the most senior American politician at the Cop30 summit in Belém, after Trump took the unprecedented step of not sending a delegation to the talks. Newsom sought to fill the notable void of official US activity by lambasting the president for tearing up climate policies and pushing for burning more of the fossil fuels that have caused dangerous global heating.\n\nOn Tuesday, it emerged that Trump has drawn up plans to open up the coast of California for oil and gas drilling, a move that Newsom said would happen “over my dead body, full stop. He said he wants to open up the coast of California, but he doesn’t want oil-drilling rigs off the coast of Florida, not across the street from Mar-a-Lago. He’s silent on that. But it’s not going to happen. It’s dead on arrival.”\n\nAccusing Trump of an assault upon the climate and on democracy, Newsom said of the president: “He’s an invasive species, he’s a wrecking-ball president. He’s trying to roll back progress of the last century. He’s trying to re-create the 19th century. He’s doubling down on stupid.”\n\nTrump has called the climate crisis a “con job” and urged countries to remain wedded to coal, oil, and gas, and even remove their climate policies if necessary in order to purchase more US fossil fuels.\n\nThe Republican president declined to send any representatives to Cop30, where countries are thrashing out new emissions-cutting targets and climate finance.\n\nNewsom said Trump’s rolling back of climate policies and removing the US from the Paris climate agreement is “an abomination, it’s a disgrace” and added this would benefit China, which is dominating the world in the manufacture and deployment of clean energy such as solar and wind.\n\n“You know who is cheering, who is singing his praises? President Xi of China,” Newsom said. “They are sitting back and dominating supply chains, because they understand the great opportunity of clean energy.”\n\nNewsom, a Democrat who became governor of California in 2019, is heading an alternate US delegation at Cop30 that includes more than 100 elected officials who are stressing that subnational jurisdictions in the US are still committed to tackling the climate crisis.\n\nNewsom is one of 24 governors who are part of the US Climate Alliance, a group of states that represents more than half of the US’s population and has stated support for climate action.\n\nThis motley group has not glossed over the jarring absence of the US government in Belém, however, and some other leading figures at the talks have expressed relief that the Trump administration wasn’t there.\n\nChristiana Figueres, former executive secretary of the United Nations framework convention on climate change, said on Tuesday that the US’s absence from the talks “actually is a good thing.”\n\n“Ciao, bambino,” was her response to the US’s departure from the Paris agreement.\n\nAt a press gaggle, Newsom said: “That’s a hell of a statement coming from the mother of the Paris agreement.” In light of the Trump administration’s behavior at an international maritime meeting last month, where officials menaced some foreign leaders and threatened tariffs on those who supported a carbon fee on shipping, a US presence could be a threat, Newsom added.\n\nTrump’s absence “creates opportunity” for local leaders to step into the fold on climate policy, Newsom said.\n\n“What stands in the way becomes the way. This is an opportunity for us bottom up at the local level to assert ourselves,” he said. “He pulled away. That’s why I pulled up.”\n\nNewsom is considered a leading candidate for the Democratic nomination for the 2028 presidential race. While he said he wouldn’t be drawn on whether he would run, he stressed that Democrats needed to reframe the debate around the climate crisis, to focus on simple messages around cost of living and the problems American households are facing in getting insurance due to repeated climate-fueled disasters.\n\nJoe Biden attempted to sell his climate policies as being a benefit for jobs and the economy, a pitch that failed to resonate with voters. Biden then dropped out of his struggling re-election campaign, with Kamala Harris losing to Trump.\n\n“Climate change can seem abstract,” Newsom said. “We need to talk in terms that people understand. It’s about people, places, lifestyles, and traditions. If we put things in those terms, we can start winning people over.”","summary":"This story was originally published by&#160;the Guardian and is reproduced here as part of the&#160;Climate Desk&#160;collaboration.

Republicans who said they were willing to die for the market now support a president who tells the government to buy up shares in the private sector. (Bernie Sanders approves.) The right has also embraced cancel culture, a progressive trend it recently despised. But conservatives aren’t the only ones emulating the other side.\n\nIn perhaps the most striking reversal of this era, progressives are now the ones who tend to speak like moralists. America is long past the days of the Christian right’s Moral Majority and the “good versus evil” wars of George W. Bush’s administration. An emerging form of progressive rhetoric is taking their place. Consider the left’s appropriation of the term moral clarity. In April, during her first major speech since Donald Trump returned to the White House, Kamala Harris praised Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and other Democrats for “speaking with moral clarity about this moment.” As AOC herself said in 2018, “There is nothing radical about moral clarity”—a phrase that still endures on T-shirts. In The Message, a 2024 essay collection by Ta-Nehisi Coates, the progressive writer recalls encouraging his students at Howard University to employ overtly moral language. “There has to be something in you,” he told them, “something that hungers for clarity.”\n\nWhen people describe the world by appealing to black-and-white morality, they tend to reveal more about themselves than anything else. For many, such language suggests that they hold their own views to be unimpeachable and the other side’s to be irredeemable. But moral clarity, like beauty, is perishable and—at least in practice—subjective. Many of the protesters who assaulted police officers in the summer of 2020, for example, did so with the same ethical certitude as those who stormed the Capitol in January 2021. Both groups believed they were redressing an injustice—one racial, one electoral—that too many others wouldn’t acknowledge. Both groups evinced a kind of moralism that blinded rather than clarified, eliminating the possibility of persuasion, compromise, or open debate.\n\nAt first glance, the left’s appeals to moral clarity might not seem controversial. To interpret reality through a moral lens is necessary and admirable, and insisting on nuance can seem obtuse when large swaths of the right have championed cruel prejudice and self-serving authoritarianism. But the left will need to reform itself in order to confront these forces. (Don’t let a few recent Democratic victories fool you.) And that will require precisely the kind of introspection and self-criticism that moralism precludes. In this sense, urging moral clarity can really be an obstacle to insight.\n\nThe left’s embrace of this language has been a years-long process. In 2020, at the height of the social-justice movement spawned by George Floyd’s killing, the investigative reporter Wesley Lowery exhorted journalists to describe the world with “moral clarity.” “Neutral objectivity trips over itself to find ways to avoid telling the truth,” Lowery wrote in The New York Times. “Moral clarity,” by contrast, demands “that politicians who traffic in racist stereotypes and tropes—however cleverly—be labeled such with clear language and unburied evidence.”\n\nLowery was responding, in part, to a Times essay by Republican Senator Tom Cotton, which argued that the rioting and looting in cities that summer required a military response. Polling showed that many Americans—perhaps most—supported Cotton’s view. Nonetheless, a chorus of progressives had deemed the op-ed racist and even life-threatening, prompting the ouster of James Bennet, one of the paper’s top editors. After Bennet’s departure, Lowery suggested that the decision to publish Cotton was not merely flawed but morally obscene. (Earlier this year, the Columbia Journalism Review reported the accounts of several women who say Lowery sexually assaulted them. Lowery said in a statement to CJR that its story was “incomplete and includes false insinuations,” but that he “should have better upheld boundaries.”)\n\nIn the years since Lowery’s call for clarity, a divide has emerged on the left over the correct moral response to Trump’s political dominance. On one side are the idealists who prioritize righteousness, even when it spells their own defeat. On the other are the pragmatists who prioritize broadening their coalition, even when it entails trade-offs.\n\nA recent exchange between Coates and the New York Times journalist Ezra Klein, two of the most prominent voices on the left, symbolized the split. One day after the assassination of the MAGA activist Charlie Kirk, Klein published a column praising him for “practicing politics in exactly the right way” and calling him “one of the era’s most effective practitioners of persuasion.” Klein vehemently disagreed with Kirk’s agenda but nonetheless concluded, “Liberalism could use more of his moxie and fearlessness.”\n\nThese statements provoked an outpouring of opprobrium. What are we to make “of the writers, the thinkers, and the pundits who cannot separate the great crime of Kirk’s death from the malignancy of his public life?” Coates asked in Vanity Fair. “Can they truly be so ignorant to the words of a man they have so rushed to memorialize?” Coates noted that intolerance and cruelty were regular features of Kirk’s activism, and he assembled a litany of quotes to prove it.\n\nKlein invited Coates on his podcast and explained his decision to write about Kirk, to which Coates responded: “Was silence not an option?” Coates seemed to suggest that saying nothing at all was better than describing the other side as anything but malicious—an inversion of the proverbial wisdom about not having anything nice to say. Later in the conversation, Klein illustrated the problem with such an approach. “I look at the last eight, 12 years, and what I see having happened is we—the coalition I am in, the things I believe in—lost ground,” he said. “We’ve stopped doing politics. We’ve written a lot of people off, and in writing them off, we are losing, and we are unable to protect ourselves, unable to protect them, and just unable to make good change in the world.”\n\nFrom a certain perspective, Klein was simply pointing out the obvious: Ideological purity won’t do you any good if it prevents you from building a coalition large enough to win power and put your ideology into practice. For Coates, however, that view gets things backwards. What good is the power to govern, he asks, if you’ve rendered yourself impure to win it? “I’m all for unifying, I’m all for bridging gaps, but not at the expense of my neighbor’s humanity,” Coates said. “I am at war with certain ideologies and ideas, and I want them expunged.”\n\nWhereas Coates spoke of a metaphorical war, the right has for decades demanded “moral clarity” in response to literal armed conflict. This began long before the term became a rallying cry for progressives, as the journalist Geoff Shullenberger has pointed out. In 2002, the Republican commentator William Bennett helped popularize the phrase in his defense of Bush’s disastrous foreign policy, Why We Fight: Moral Clarity and the War on Terrorism. More recently, in the context of the war in Gaza, conservatives have used appeals to anti-Semitism as a pretext to clamp down on universities, a campaign that the right has described in militaristic terms. In both contexts, moralized rhetoric granted conservative projects an almost undeniable rationale: Who could oppose fighting terrorism or fighting bigotry against Jews?\n\nIn 1961, the psychiatrist Robert Jay Lifton identified a series of what he called “thought-terminating clichés”—phrases that are used to dismiss any examination of ambiguity. (Think: “Let’s agree to disagree.”) These platitudes are “the start and finish of any ideological analysis,” Clifton wrote; people resort to such “language of non-thought” when they want to smooth over cognitive dissonance and eschew intellectual discomfort. Moral clarity now belongs on that list. Invoking the phrase stifles dissent and critical thinking. It either ends debates prematurely or makes them, in Shullenberger’s words, “interminable and unproductive.”\n\nStill, to give up entirely on the ideal of moral clarity is to succumb to nihilism. Societies need a baseline moral consensus in order to reject the beliefs and behaviors that violate their shared norms. In her astute 2008 book, Moral Clarity: A Guide for Grown-Up Idealists, the philosopher Susan Neiman points out that failing to find any moral clarity can lead people to “settle for the far more dangerous simplicity, or purity, instead.”\n\nThe question of moral purity has taken on specific electoral stakes for the left thanks to a pair of recent controversies involving Graham Platner, a former Marine running in Maine’s Democratic Senate primary. Last month, deleted Reddit posts were discovered in which Platner endorsed political violence and called himself “a communist.” Soon after, a video surfaced showing Platner with a tattoo of the Totenkopf, a symbol worn by members of the SS who presided over concentration camps. Platner has apologized for many of his posts, denied accusations that he’s a Nazi, and said he didn’t know about the symbol’s affiliation when he got the tattoo, which he’s since covered up with another one.\n\nMany Democrats called for Platner to resign despite his substantial lead in polling from before the scandals. (A more recent survey suggests that the controversies would hurt his chances in the general election.) But Bernie Sanders stood by his earlier endorsement: “There might be one or two more important issues,” he said. A number of influential left-wing voices echoed the senator. “Censorious, hall monitor liberalism that refuses to accept growth in people,” the progressive commentator Emma Vigeland wrote on X, “is far more of a threat to the Democratic Party’s chances in the future than anything dug up on Graham Platner.”\n\nOf course, “no Nazi tattoos” and “don’t advocate political violence” are not particularly lofty ethical bars to clear; no one should be dismissed as a snowflake for finding such transgressions disqualifying. But the fact that many on the left seem willing to extend Platner the opportunity to redeem his mistakes is a promising sign. It is grounded in the recognition that Democrats’ long-term moral interests are moot if they can’t win elections.\n\nThe alternative—rigid sanctimoniousness that cannot allow the possibility of forgiveness or negotiation—is not clarity. It’s dogmatism.","summary":"Under Trump, progressives have embraced the rhetoric of “moral clarity.” It won’t help their cause.","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2025/11/democrats-rhetoric-moral-clarity/684910/","image":"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/cA2k9W0re7ZStYkMV-6HLWTlU3s=/0x0:2000x1125/720x405/media/img/mt/2025/11/2025_11_12_TCW_moral_clarity_final/original.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-13 12:30:00","author":"Thomas Chatterton Williams","authors":["Thomas Chatterton Williams"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.205},{"id":378592228,"title":"Vance Critiques Cheney in Posthumous Commentary","text":"In a recent gathering of MAHA enthusiasts in Washington, D.C., JD Vance took the opportunity to harshly criticize the late Vice President Dick Cheney.

The group — which includes five Republican and two Democratic former FCC commissioners, as well as several former senior staffers — calls for eliminating the agency’s longstanding “News Distortion” policy. The policy, according to the FCC’s website description, allows the agency to sanction broadcasters if “they have deliberately distorted a factual news report.” The policy is not codified, but grew out of a standard used by the FCC to evaluate broadcasters. It was rarely invoked for decades until this year, when President Donald Trump’s pick to lead the FCC, Brendan Carr, cited it in several high-profile disputes with networks his agency regulates. A representative for the FCC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. According to the FCC, invoking the policy “must involve a significant event and not merely a minor or incidental aspect of the news report,” and that “expressions of opinion or errors stemming from mistakes are not actionable.” The petition was filed on Thursday by the Protect Democracy Project, a legal nonprofit “dedicated to defeating the authoritarian threat.” Any interested person or group can petition a federal agency to create, adjust or repeal a rule, according to the Administrative Conference of the United States. But agencies are not required to use specific procedures when receiving or responding to petitions. If the FCC chair declines to act — for instance, by directing the FCC to invite public comment — Gigi Sohn, an advisor to the petition, said that would give the Protect Democracy Project a stronger basis for a lawsuit over the issue. Sohn was a longtime public advocate in telecommunications policy and counsel to Tom Wheeler, the chair of the FCC during President Barack Obama’s second term. She was nominated to serve as an FCC commissioner under President Joe Biden, but withdrew her candidacy after a wave of personal attacks. Sohn said that Carr’s use of the policy illustrates the risk of government overreach. “In the right hands, it could stop misinformation, disinformation, what have you. But the problem is, it’s never been used that way, and the FCC has other tools,” she said. “Right now, it’s being used as a cudgel. And this is not just about Chair Carr. This is about future chairs or commissioners who want to use this as a tool of censorship.” The petition cites several incidents that it says illustrate the policy’s potential for abuse. In February, the FCC invoked the policy in its investigations into CBS over allegations that the news program \"60 Minutes\" intentionally deceived its viewers with its editing of an interview with Vice President Kamala Harris. Before the investigation began, Trump sued CBS’s parent company, Paramount, for $20 billion over the interview. In July, the parties settled for $16 million. Paramount at the time was pursuing an $8 billion merger with Skydance Media, which required FCC approval. The agency approved it later that month. In a September interview with conservative influencer Benny Johnson, Carr said that local ABC affiliates could be in violation of the News Distortion policy if they continued to air Jimmy Kimmel Live after the host’s remarks about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. In the episode, Kimmel criticized conservatives as “doing everything they can to score political points” from the killing. Licensed broadcasters that aired Kimmel risked “the possibility of fines or license revocations from the FCC if [they] continue to run content that ends up being a pattern of news distortion,” Carr said. ABC suspended Kimmel a few hours later. The network reinstated Kimmel the next week after substantial backlash, including from conservatives who criticized Carr. Ted Cruz, R-Texas called Carr’s remarks “dangerous as hell“ and Rand Paul, R-Ky. said they were “absolutely inappropriate.” Carr later denied his comments were intended as a threat. “What I spoke about last week is that when concerns are raised about news distortion there’s an easy way for parties to address that and work that out,” Carr said at the Concordia media summit in September. “In the main, that takes place between local television stations that are licensed by the FCC and what we call national programmers like Disney. They work that out, and there doesn’t need to be any involvement of the FCC.” But the former FCC chairs petitioning for the policy reversal say they took the comments as a threat. “Wielding the news distortion policy, the FCC has already opened or threatened to open investigations against private broadcasters due to disagreements with editorial decisions or statements made in a comedic monologue,” the petition said. “Because the FCC has no legitimate interest in correcting or punishing what it considers to be slanted news coverage, the news distortion policy lacks a meaningful function.” U.S. law, rooted in the First Amendment, generally prohibits the FCC from engaging in government censorship of speech. The FCC’s jurisdiction is limited to broadcast organizations like network television and radio stations, and cannot police cable news, newspapers or online-only news outlets. The agency didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The petition says it is not designed to overturn the “hoax” rule, which bans broadcasters from deliberately presenting wholly false information about a crime or catastrophe without a disclaimer that it’s fiction. The signatories of the petition include: Thomas Wheeler, a Democratic chair appointed by Barack Obama; Rachelle Chong, a Republican commissioner appointed by Bill Clinton; Alfred Sikes, a Republican chair appointed by George H.W. Bush; Republican Andrew Barrett and Democrat Ervin Duggan, both commissioners appointed by H.W. Bush; Mark Fowler, a Republican chair appointed by Ronald Reagan; and Dennis Patrick, a Republican commissioner appointed by Ronald Reagan.","summary":"A group of former FCC leaders has petitioned the agency to repeal the policy the Trump administration invoked in discussions surrounding Jimmy Kimmel.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/fcc-chair-trump-kimmel-60-minutes-policy-abc-disney-distortion-cbs-rcna243495","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251001-brendan-carr-ac-723p-d224fd.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-13 11:05:00","author":"Kevin Collier","authors":["Kevin Collier"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.304},{"id":378558292,"title":"18 Trump voters explain why a slice of his base is unhappy with his economic performance","text":"Billy Edmonson voted for President Donald Trump in 2024 because of his stances on border security, gun rights and the economy. One year after casting his ballot, Edmonson is finding it difficult to make ends meet. “Everything’s already so expensive. ... That’s the worst thing about his presidency so far, is he promised things coming down and prices are not coming down. I make more money than I’ve ever made in my life right now, and it has, financially, been a struggle,” said Edmonson, a 35-year-old construction worker from Missouri. Edmonson recalled that Trump promised to start lowering prices on his first day in office. “It just doesn’t seem like there’s been a whole lot of focus on, ‘Hey, let’s get these prices down.’ It’s just been like, ‘Hey, prices are high because Biden did this.’ It’s like, well, Biden’s not in office anymore,” said Edmonson, a self-described independent, later adding, “It’s personally frustrating.” Edmonson is not alone. Nearly two-thirds (63%) of registered voters, including 30% of Republicans, said in the recent national NBC News poll that Trump has fallen short of their expectations on the cost of living and the economy. After being one of the big reasons why Trump won a return to the White House in 2024, Trump’s performance on the economy has become one of the big drags on his second term. While a number of Trump voters told NBC News in January that they’d give Trump a relatively long leash to improve the economy, the new interviews suggest that for some he’s running out of slack. Trump himself has cast doubt on surveys showing Americans are anxious about the economy, telling Fox News this week, “I think polls are fake. We have the greatest economy we’ve ever had.” NBC News spoke to 18 Trump voters who participated in the most recent NBC News poll and said Trump had not met their expectations on the economy to explore how this group was thinking about Trump and experiencing the economy — and whether they were still committed to supporting his party. None regretted their vote for Trump last year, in many cases because of a deep frustration with Democrats. A handful said they’d be open to voting for Democrats in the future, though most planned to keep voting Republican. When it comes to the economy, many said the pain they’re feeling is real. “He and his advisers claim the country is going well, prices are going down, the tariffs are doing wonderfully,” Susan, a 66-year-old retiree from Nevada, said of Trump. (Several interviewees declined to share their last name when discussing politics, with some citing the nation’s polarized political atmosphere.) “But when you go to the store, the prices are up,” she added. Navigating high prices During and after his 2024 campaign, Trump not only promised to halt inflation but to bring prices lower after several years of post-Covid growth. That promise, made even though overall consumer prices essentially never decrease over time, cuts to the core of some of his voters’ complaints. “It’s always hard to bring down prices when somebody else has screwed something up like [President Joe Biden] did,” Trump said during a news conference in January, weeks before being sworn in. “We’re going to have prices down. I think you’re going to see some pretty drastic price reductions.” Jeremiah, a 48-year-old Republican from Utah who works in the aerospace industry, has voted for Trump each time he ran for president and backed him last year because he saw Trump as a change agent. But he said Trump’s handling of the economy so far has been “mediocre.” “I was definitely hoping to see a lot of prices come back down, like gas for your car, diesel, utilities, groceries. I was hoping to see it all come back down and level out at least, but it’s not. It just keeps getting worse,” Jeremiah said. “I have a 20-year-old son and a 17-year-old daughter, and they can’t live on their own,” he later added. “My son’s a welder, and he makes $28 an hour, and he’s still not out on his own. Everything is just so overpriced. It’s ridiculous. When I graduated high school, I moved out and had a $300 a month apartment, piece of cake, 10 bucks an hour.” Edmonson, the Missouri construction worker, noted that he travels often for work. But motel and grocery prices have jumped, even for items like a can of soup, he said. And the high costs have him reconsidering his work on the road. “It’s almost getting to the point where it’s time for me to find something at home,” Edmonson said, later adding, “Because if I’m gonna sink, I might as well sink at home.” Patty, a 70-year-old Republican retiree from Pennsylvania, blamed Trump for the country’s economic woes. Trump, she said, “has always been a very rich man. He’s never had to do anything his whole life. He’s never had to go shop. So, he has no idea what a true working person in their daily life has to do.” “I was surprised that the groceries haven’t went down. In fact, they keep going up. So that would be my biggest disappointment,” said Roxanne Novit, a 69-year-old retiree from Colorado and a self-described Republican. Susan, the Nevada retiree who is not registered with any party, said Trump’s handling of the economy “is not at all what I expected,” noting she was hopeful Trump would focus on “opening up mining and gasoline exploration.” “It seems like they’re moving a little slow on that because they’re spending all the time on the tariffs or making nice to the Chinese president or something like that,” Susan said. Giving him time But some voters were willing to give Trump some more time to turn things around, even among the subset who said they believe he’s fallen short. Overall, most Republicans still back Trump on the economy and other issues, according to the NBC News poll and other surveys. “I would like to see the economy turn up a little quicker, but everything takes time. You can’t expect it overnight,” said independent Robert Duran, 68, a retired law enforcement officer from Massachusetts. William Scheuer, a 68-year-old New Yorker, who said he voted for Trump in 2024 because he’s “old-fashioned” on things like social issues, agreed that Trump has been “falling a little short” on the economy, specifically noting prices. “Everything’s going up, it’s going up more than what the government is telling you,” he said, before adding he’s “confident [Trump] will” turn it around. Craig Lovejoy, a 32-year-old Florida independent who works in pest control, said Trump is doing “better than many” presidents on addressing the economy. “I don’t think that one president will be all it takes to get things back on track, but I think we’re headed in the right direction,” Lovejoy said. Some voters were sympathetic to Trump’s tariff policies in particular, even as they were navigating higher prices. “The steak I used to buy that used to be like 40 bucks is now 80. I get it,” said Jason Olson, a 50-year-old small-business owner from South Carolina who typically backs Republicans. “And I know tariffs have raised prices on a lot of things as well. But I also understand the reason behind the tariffs are they want to bring industry back to the U.S.” Tim Fleming, a 42-year-old self-described libertarian who works in injection molding at a factory in Tennessee, agreed that Trump’s presidency has been “a little disappointing.” He raised frustrations about how Trump’s pledge not to tax overtime and tips was implemented as a tax deduction, so he and others won’t see the fruits of that until they file their taxes next year. “My overtime is still getting taxed; my bonuses are still getting taxed,” he said. “It was not what it was made out to be.” But he noted he believes he’s seen the direct fruits of Trump’s tariff push: the return of jobs in his county that had been offshored to Mexico. “The tariffs helped create a lot of jobs where I live,” Fleming said. Those comments come as the White House has tried to argue the administration is making important strides on affordability. “The president has done a lot that has already paid off in lower interest rates and lower inflation, but we inherited a disaster from Joe Biden and Rome wasn’t built in a day. We’re going to keep on working to make a decent life affordable in this country, and that’s the metric by which we’ll ultimately be judged in 2026 and beyond,” Vice President JD Vance wrote on X the day after Election Day. Down on Democrats While several Trump voters raised concerns about the economy and high prices, none of the voters, who are largely Republicans or independents, said they regretted their choice last year. “I wouldn’t change my vote, but I’m not happy,” said Elliot Muegge, a 32-year-old farmer from Oklahoma. Amanda, a 48-year-old postal worker from Missouri, said she still finds it difficult to make a budget because of high food prices. But, she said, she thinks former Vice President Kamala Harris “would have been worse.” A self-described conservative, Amanda said she would be open to supporting a Democratic candidate in a future election, but “not a progressive, more like an old-school Democrat.” A handful of Trump voters also said they would be open to supporting Democrats in the future, depending on the candidate. But others said backing a Democrat was off the table. “I think that they pander to friend groups and minorities and they look silly doing it. It’s fake,” Fleming, of Tennessee, said. “I haven’t found a single Democrat” that inspires trust, said Lovejoy, of Florida. Edmonson, the Missouri construction worker, said it could be years before he considers supporting a Democratic candidate, noting his strong support for gun rights. “They just don’t care about people in general. They want to say they care about people, but that — to me, all they want is, is votes,” Edmonson said, noting he is still frustrated with Trump. “I don’t feel like I can vote for a Democrat candidate,” Edmonson said. “I feel like I don’t have a candidate really.” Still, others who are open to backing Democrats warn that the economic angst coursing through the country — which Trump used to his advantage amid anger at the Biden administration in 2024 — could translate to political losses for Republicans. “Did he not promise the American people — Day 1 — that prices were going to go down? We are now in Month 11 and things continue to rise,” said Patty, the 70-year-old Pennsylvanian. While she said she regularly votes Republican, she’s split her ticket in the past, and she said she likes her state’s Democratic governor, Josh Shapiro. “The Republican Party is in for a rude awakening, and I think it’s not a bad thing,” she added. Muegge, from Oklahoma, shared a similar sentiment about the economy hurting Trump’s political standing. While he doesn’t blame Trump specifically for the cost of living, he expressed frustration about how he “unfairly manipulates the markets with his social media presence.” He pointed to a recent conversation he had with his father, also a Republican. “He and I were having a conversation, and he said, ‘I hate Trump.’ And I was like, ‘Oh, you do, too? I thought I was alone on this island,’” he said. “I don’t know if other people are saying that quietly behind their own closed doors and then pounding their chest in public,” he said. “I just don’t know.”","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/18-trump-voters-explain-slice-base-unhappy-economic-performance-rcna243440","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/250407-donald-trump-tariff-poster-ew-356p-ce9475.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-13 10:00:00","author":"Alexandra Marquez,Ben Kamisar,Bridget Bowman,Juhi Doshi,Maya Rosenberg,Owen Auston-Babcock","authors":["Alexandra Marquez","Ben Kamisar","Bridget Bowman","Juhi Doshi","Maya Rosenberg","Owen Auston-Babcock"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.46},{"id":378630598,"title":"Seth Meyers Hounds Trump Over The 1 Thing He Totally 'F**king Hates'","text":"“Late Night” host Seth Meyers on Wednesday flagged Jeffrey Epstein’s “damning” description of Donald Trump as a “dog” while highlighting the late convicted sex offender’s 2011 email to associate Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\nEpstein, in one of the three bombshell emails released by House Democrats, wrote that he wanted Maxwell to “realize” that the “dog that hasn’t barked is Trump.”\n\nMeyers declared that Epstein’s comments are also an “insult” to the president.\n\n“Because Trump fucking hates dogs!” the host stressed.\n\nMeyers tossed to a supercut of Trump’s history of hurling canine-themed insults at his foes.\n\n“She lied like a dog!” Trump said of Hillary Clinton at a 2016 rally in Denver.\n\n“He was fired — like a dog, he was fired,” Trump said in a 2020 interview on Fox News.\n\n“She basically choked and froze like a dog,” Trump said in an apparent reference to his then-opponent Kamala Harris at a 2024 campaign rally in North Carolina.\n\nMeyers chimed in, “Dogs don’t choke, they don’t tell lies and they don’t get fired.”\n\nHe continued, “Even when a dog has a job, like sniffing for drugs at the airport, if they’re bad at it, you just replace them.

Here's an X post he shared:\n\n🚨NEW: Charlamagne:\"Jasmine Crockett is actually what the Democrats should be leaning into. Because she is a phenomenal messenger ... the most effective messenger that the Democratic Party has right now. And they need to be using her as a Trojan horse.\"@DailyCaller pic.twitter.com/wZcvlVf05n— Jason Cohen 🇺🇸 (@JasonJournoDC) November 11, 2025\n\nVirtually every prominent Dem name mentioned near the top of the food chain is met with enthusiastic, \"Oh, please run in 2028!\" responses from Republicans. It's quite the carnival carousel over there when looking around for someone to emerge as a leader and/or candidate for 2028. There's a lot of desperation surrounding these conversations, largely because actual Democratic leadership in Congress is so pathetically weak. Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jefferies don't inspire confidence in anyone. In fact, Schumer is now the least popular Democratic Senate leader ever, which my friend and colleague Ed Morrissey wrote about here.\n\nBack to Crockett. Like so many Dem women, she adopts different accents and personae for public appearances. One of Crockett's go-to shticks is that of a street-wise tough, as if she is straight from the 'hood. In reality, Crockett couldn't find the 'hood if she had a team of Sherpas guiding her. She attended Mary Institute and St. Louis Country Day School, then a tony, private all-girls Catholic high school. Day schools tend not to have a lot of mean streets around them.\n\nThe charade continues. This is from Catherine: \n\nIn case you needed more proof that Democrats are hypocritical plutocrats who impoverish the middle class and poor while enriching themselves, I give you Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-Texas).Just this year, Crockett expended $75,000 — almost $10,000 higher than the average annual U.S. salary — on luxuries like limos, resorts, and personal security. Fox News obtained Federal Election Commission (FEC) filings detailing Crockett’s reckless and lavish spending.\n\nYeah, she's got a lot of rough edges. \n\nMaybe she's the Democrats' most effective messenger because she spreads the horse manure around better than any of her colleagues. That's quite an achievement if you think about it. Being disingenuous is a way of political life among the Democrats. Cynics would say that all politicians are like that but, trust me, it's a dark art form with the Dems. \n\nJasmine Crockett is a horrible human being. That should shoot her right to the top of the Democratic Party's future plans should she have higher political aspirations. She's also one of the easiest Dems to pick apart. She has that sense of privilege and entitlement that Hillary Clinton has, and believes that she's untouchable. She would be an avalanche of unforced errors with a national spotlight on her during a campaign. \n\nSo run, Jasmine, run. \n\nContributions to the Mailbag of Magnificence can be sent to [email protected]\n\nClick the button below to get the Morning Briefing emailed to you every weekday.

The resignations followed exposure of the splicing together of two parts of a speech by President Donald Trump on Jan. 6, 2021. The edits made it look and sound like the president was urging his followers to attack the Capitol violently.\n\nOne emailer said the first \"B\" in BBC should stand for bias. That reminded me of what some conservatives called CNN during the Clinton administration (the Clinton News Network), because of their perceived bias\n\nThe second writer said the edit was only a \"mistake.\" It wasn't a mistake. It was deliberate and it was made with the intention of having viewers accept their desired negative opinion of Trump. In another country and in another era, this would be called propaganda. If this sounds like the editing of the CBS \"60 Minutes\" interview with Kamala Harris to make her sound articulate, it should. Both flowed from the same liberal worldview.\n\nKudos to the London Daily Telegraph for practicing real journalism and exposing the edit of the Trump speech.\n\nDuring World War II, the BBC was a trusted source of information. It sent coded information to the French resistance and took other actions in support of the war effort. This was accurately depicted in the film \"The Longest Day.\" In recent years, the BBC has seen its level of trust decline.\n\nA survey conducted by David Pickering of The Conversation, a news organization that calls itself \"dedicated to facts and evidence,\" noted that \"Trust in the BBC is heavily conditioned by political identity.\" The survey of 11,170 people in the UK \"showed striking differences between how people with left-wing and right-wing party affiliations felt about the broadcaster.\"\n\nThe editing incident isn't the first time the credibility of the BBC has been called into question. Several internal studies have found the organization to have reported unfairly on the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. The studies changed nothing as the pro-Palestinian bias has continued. It is the same when it comes to their reporting on \"climate change.\"\n\nA Wall Street Journal editorial notes the BBC has had an LGBTQ desk within its London headquarters to make sure stories were favorable about transgender issues. Stories that did not reflect the BBC's \"liberal orthodoxy\" were suppressed, notes the Journal.\n\nOn top of this, streamers and owners of television sets are required to pay an annual TV license fee of 174.50 (about $230) per year for a color license and 58.50 ($77) for a black-and-white license, a compulsory payment used primarily to fund the BBC's television, radio and online services.\n\nDoes anyone still own a black-and-white TV? And on top of this, viewers must watch endless commercials, some of which are more entertaining and creative than the programs.\n\nEfforts by some conservative members of Parliament to eliminate the TV license fee have failed. As in America, politicians are reluctant to give up money.\n\nTim Davie, the now-resigned director general of the BBC said in a statement: \"This narrative will not just be given by our enemies. It's our narrative. We own things.\"\n\nRight there, you have the reason so much of the media in the UK and the U.S. are held in low regard. They think they \"own things,\" instead of exercising a responsibility to serve the people fairly and accurately. As with other exposures of bias, I suspect little will change within the BBC unless it follows the example of the new president of CBS News and begins hiring reporters with a conservative worldview who will presumably report conservative ideas fairly and accurately.\n\nReaders may email Cal Thomas at tcaeditors@tribpub.com.

Donald Trump signed the bill on Wednesday night, saying “we’re sending a clear message that we will never give in to extortion, because that’s what it was … the Democrats tried to extort our country”.\n\nSix Democrats broke with their party to vote for the bill: Adam Gray of California, Tom Suozzi of New York, Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington, Don Davis of North Carolina, Henry Cuellar of Texas and Jared Golden of Maine. Two Republicans, Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Greg Steube of Florida, voted against it.\n\n“The Democrat shutdown is finally over thanks to House and Senate Republicans,” House Republican leadership said in a statement.\n\n“There is absolutely no question now that Democrats are responsible for millions of American families going hungry, millions of travelers left stranded in airports, and our troops left wondering if they would receive their next paycheck.”\n\nIn remarks on the House floor shortly before the vote, the Democratic minority leader Hakeem Jeffries had pledged to continue to press for the subsidies’ extensions.\n\n“This fight is not over. We’re just getting started,” he said. “Either Republicans finally decide to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits this year, or the American people will throw Republicans out of their jobs next year and end the speakership of Donald J Trump once and for all. That’s how this fight ends.”\n\nThe spending standoff was the biggest battle between congressional Democrats and Republicans since Trump returned to the White House earlier this year. It resulted in unprecedented disruptions to government services, with the Trump administration ordering cuts to commercial air travel across the country, and the first-ever halt to the largest federal food aid program.\n\nReeling from their election defeats last year, Democrats had seized on an end-of-September expiration of government funding to make a stand on healthcare, a signature issue of the party over the past decade and a half. The Obamacare tax credits were created during Joe Biden’s presidency, and lowered premiums for enrollers of plans bought under the law.\n\nDemocrats wanted them extended as part of any deal to continue government funding. The party made other demands as well, including curbs on Trump’s use of rescissions to slash money Congress had previously authorized and an undoing of cuts to Medicaid which Republicans had approved earlier in the year. But as the battle went on, it became clear that an extension of the subsidies was the main objective.\n\nRepublicans, who control both the House and the Senate, counter-offered with a bill to fund the government through the third week of November, without any spending cuts or major changes to policy. They passed the measure through the lower chamber with only a single Democrat in support, but the minority used the Senate’s filibuster to block its passage there.\n\nThe shutdown began on 1 October, resulting in around 700,000 federal workers being furloughed. Hundreds of thousands of others, from active duty military to law enforcement to airport security screeners, remained on the job without pay.\n\nRussell Vought, the White House office of management and budget director known for his hostility towards the federal workforce, seized on the funding lapse to order further layoffs of government employees. He also cut funding for infrastructure projects in states that voted for Kamala Harris last year.\n\nThough Trump ordered military members be paid in a move that many experts called likely illegal, other federal workers missed paychecks. Food banks began reporting increased demand as the shutdown went on, with the need worsening after the White House halted payments under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or food stamps, citing the government funding lapse.\n\nLast week, Sean Duffy, the transportation secretary, ordered a cutback in flights at US airports, saying air traffic controllers were facing unprecedented strain after weeks of unpaid work. Widespread flight cancellations were reported in the days that followed.\n\nIn the Senate, most Democrats remained onboard with the party’s strategy for weeks. Senate majority leader John Thune held 14 votes on the GOP funding measure, but only three members of the minority caucus ever broke ranks to support it.\n\nIn early November, Democrats swept off-year elections, winning gubernatorial elections in Virginia and New Jersey by significant margins, as well as voter approval for new congressional maps in California that will help the party’s candidates.\n\nDemocratic leaders said the wins vindicated their strategy in the funding fight, a statement Trump echoed, saying “the shutdown is a big factor” in the GOP’s poor performance. He began pressing Republican senators to scrap the filibuster, which would have negated the 60-vote threshold spending legislation needs to clear in the chamber, where the GOP holds 53 seats.\n\nMeanwhile, a small group of moderate members of the Senate Democratic caucus had been negotiating a compromise to end the shutdown. It ended up funding the government through January and undoing the layoffs the Trump administration had ordered after the shutdown began.\n\nBut it included no additional funding for the Affordable Care Act tax credits – instead, Thune agreed to allow a vote on the issue by mid-December. There’s no telling if it will win the GOP support needed to pass, and Mike Johnson, the Republican House speaker, has not said he will put any legislation up for a vote.\n\nDespite howls of outrage from both House and Senate Democrats, the Senate passed it with 60 votes on Monday: eight from lawmakers in the Democratic caucus, and the rest from Republicans.\n\nYet the fight over the ACA subsidies is unlikely to be over. Enrollers in the plans received notices of premium increases in November because of the tax credits’ expiration. One study predicted they would rise by an average of 26%, potentially bringing them to levels unaffordable to many.\n\nWith government funding expiring again at the end of January, Democrats could use the opportunity to again demand the subsidies be extended.\n\n“Dozens of House Republicans have been claiming over the last few weeks that they know that is something that needs to be addressed,” Jeffries said in a Tuesday interview with CNN.\n\n“And now we’re going to have to see some action or whether it was just talk from these House Republicans because Democrats are going to continue to stay in the arena as it relates to dealing with the healthcare crisis that Republicans have visited on the American people.”","summary":"President signs bill to restart federal operations after House passes measure in 222-209 vote\n\nThe longest US government shutdown in history ended on Wednesday after more than 42 days, following the House of Representative’s passage of a bill negotiated by Republicans and a splinter group of Democrat-aligned senators.\n\nThe compromise sets the stage for government operations to return to normal through January, while leaving unresolved the issue of expiring tax credits for Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare health plans, which most Democrats demanded be extended in any deal to reopen the government.\n\n Continue reading...","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/12/house-bill-government-shutdown-vote","image":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3e403f7d13d86efeb2a82704f6e3de7fe2a40b5/688_0_6880_5504/master/6880.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-13 03:30:51","author":"Chris Stein","authors":["Chris Stein"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.262},{"id":378437636,"title":"China’s New Hongqi Bridge Collapses — Could California’s Chinese Bridge Be Far Behind?","text":"On Tuesday, a landslide caused China’s newly built Hongqi Bridge “to fracture and collapse,” NBC reports, “sending large pieces of concrete far below in a cloud of dust.” There were no casualties but last year a “partial collapse” of a highway bridge in Shaanxi province killed at least 11 people. These failures revive safety concerns on the new span of the Bay Bridge connecting San Francisco and Oakland. The bridge was built with Chinese steel and Chinese labor, but there’s more about the project people should know.\n\nCalifornia boasts the Golden Gate Bridge, the Alfred Zampa Memorial Bridge over the Carquinez Strait, and the Coronado Bridge linking Coronado and San Diego. These structures were all built with American materials and labor — Alfred Zampa was an ironworker — and have stood the test of time. The new Bay Bridge span broke with that practice.\n\nCalifornia politicians turned down federal funding because it would have required American steel. The bridge decks and materials were constructed in China by the Shanghai Zhenhua Heavy Industries Company, which at the time had no experience building bridges. The company’s 3,000 employees on the project included steel-cutters, welders, polishers, and engineers.\n\nThe bridge came in 10 years late and $5 billion over budget — a lot more than the $250 million to retrofit the original span, damaged in the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989. The new span was opened in 2013, and in 2014 Bay Area Democrat Mark DeSaulnier, chairman of the Senate Transportation and Housing Committee, held hearings on the project.\n\nThe Chinese steel, experts testified, was too brittle. Bolts and rods were cracked, and every one of the bridge’s 750 panels had to be repaired. In 2013, long metal rods began to snap. Metallurgical engineer Lisa Thomas attributed this to hydrogen embrittlement, a problem with the grade BD steel used on the project.\n\nGeologist Michael Morgan testified that safety problems were covered up and called for a criminal investigation. State audit agencies failed to take action, so Morgan took his story to Charles Piller of the Sacramento Bee, which ran a series on safety concerns with welds, rods, bolts, corrosion, and such.\n\nIn early 2014, water leaks along the suspension structure left rust-colored signs of corrosion. When apprised of the safety issues, then-Gov. Jerry Brown famously said “I mean, look, shit happens.” Engineering professionals offered more serious analysis.\n\nUniversity of California, Berkeley, structural engineering professor Abolhasaan Astaneh-Asi told reporters he declined to use the bridge and warned about faulty design. “If a single component fails, the whole thing comes down,” the professor explained. “Fracture critical bridges have been out of favor since the 1960s. And when you look at this new span, there are many things that can go wrong.”\n\nThe Hongqi bridge collapse occurred in Sichuan, a seismically active region where in 2008, a 7.9 magnitude earthquake killed more than 69,000 people. By some accounts, nearly 90,000 people were counted dead or missing and 375,000 injured.\n\nThe San Francisco area, home to more than 7.7 million people, is seismically active. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, a major quake is due in the Bay Area by 2032. Californians will have to wait and see if what can happen does happen.\n\nBefore DeSaulnier moved on to Congress, his hearing was broadcast live on the California Channel, the Golden State’s version of C-SPAN, launched in 1993. Under Attorney General Kamala Harris, no criminal investigation of the bridge took place. In 2019, under Gov. Gavin Newsom, the state shut down the California Channel. As Capitol Weekly wondered, “What’s the future of digital legislative transparency in California?”\n\nIn April of 2020, Gov. Newsom announced spending of nearly $1 billion on masks with Build Your Dreams, a Chinese motor vehicle company which, at the time, did not manufacture protective gear. In California, what goes around tends to come around.\n\nLloyd Billingsley is a policy fellow at the Independent Institute in Oakland, Calif.\n\nNewsom Rewards Reality Dysphoria\n\nFrank Meyer, Elsie Meyer and the Quest for School Choice\n\nCalifornia’s ‘Pillage’ People Lose Equity Theft Battle","url":"https://spectator.org/chinas-new-hongqi-bridge-collapses-could-californias-chinese-bridge-be-far-behind/","image":"https://spectator.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-12-at-4.44.13-PM.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-13 03:28:53","author":"Lloyd Billingsley","authors":["Lloyd Billingsley"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.503},{"id":378428274,"title":"Chris Murphy Goes Off On Democrats At New Hampshire Town Hall","text":"MANCHESTER, N.H. ― Sen.

He pointed to the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which allowed Medicare to negotiate prices for some prescription drugs, as one key example.\n\n“What was our message on prescription drugs? Probably, you never remembered,” Murphy said, before mocking Democratic talking points about the bill at the time. “It was that we’re going to use the bulk purchasing powers of Medicare to negotiate down the price of the 10 most ― you’ve lost it, right?

Many House Democrats and Democratic candidates running for office have called on Schumer to step aside as leader.\n\n“I think that the party continues to be divided, and I think that would be a problem for any leader,” Murphy told reporters after the event. “So I think the caucus has to be sharper.

After the temporary suspension, Kimmel returned to the air and issued an apology to Charlie Kirk’s family. Jennifer Aniston, among several public figures, has now added her voice to the ongoing debate about freedom of expression and the current political climate in the United States.In an interview with Elle, Aniston said, \"Unthinkable things are happening. It’s very dangerous and very unfortunate. But at the end of the day, we’re the viewers.\" She emphasised the influence of audiences, stating, \"We subscribe to these networks and streaming services, so it really comes down to the people and their voices. All those subscription cancellations spoke volumes.\"Kimmel’s original comments that sparked the controversy included references to the \"MAGA gang\" and accusations that individuals were \"desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them,\" and attempting to \"score political points from it.\"Following the incident, Aniston called for less division and more unity among Americans. She remarked, \"I know we don’t agree on everything, and that is the beauty of this country, but GOOD LORD aren’t you tired of this negativity towards each other? The intimidation and constant threats to those who do not think the same as the other? Let’s please end this era of fear, chaos and the attacks on our democracy – and vote for someone who will unite us and not continue to threaten to divide us.\"Aniston also urged the public to participate in the electoral process, stating, \"We are so lucky we get to VOTE and this election is in our hands! We only have one week until Election Day so talk to your friends, your family, your neighbors and let’s find our way back to each other with respect, common cause, and LOVE.\".preferred-source-banner{ margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom:10px;}Her recent statements build on her earlier endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.

Please remember that whoever you are and wherever you live, your voice matters.

Chuy Garcia’s decision to effectively hand-pick his successor in a brazen move that critics likened to a coronation could result in a formal condemnation by the House of Representatives.\n\nDemocratic Washington Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez announced Wednesday that she would introduce a resolution of disapproval seeking to formally punish Garcia for “undermining” the election to replace him in Congress. The surprise move comes after Garcia’s chief of staff entered the race for his seat in the final hours before the filing deadline, only for Garcia to announce his retirement after that deadline had passed. (RELATED: Democrat Complains About ICE Arresting Migrant ‘Parent’ Outside School. Turns Out Perp Is Twice-Deported Gangbanger)\n\nGarcia’s maneuver made Patty Garcia, his staffer of no relation, the Democratic Party’s automatic nominee in next year’s midterm elections and precluded voters from playing an active role in choosing between a potential slate of candidates.\n\nAmid debate on the House floor Monday about reopening the government, Gluesenkamp Perez sought to force a vote on condemning Garcia’s actions. The Washington state Democrat argued that Garcia’s succession plan constitutes “election denial” and violates “the spirit of the Constitution”\n\n“Congressman Chuy Garcia’s stated reasons for retirement are honorable, but his decision to anoint an heir is fundamentally antidemocratic,” Gluesenkamp Perez said in a statement. “This is the kind of thing that makes folks tune out of electoral politics.”\n\n“If we fail to hold our colleagues accountable for this subversion of elections, we own the consequences,” Gluesenkamp Perez added. “Americans bled and died to secure the right to elect their leaders. We can’t expect to be taken seriously in the fight for free and fair elections if we turn a blind eye to election denial on our side of the aisle.”\n\nSince Gluesenkamp Perez’s resolution is privileged, the House will have two legislative days to vote on the matter if she does not withdraw the measure.\n\n“Congressman García made a deeply personal decision based on his health, his wife’s worsening condition and his responsibility to the grandchildren he is raising after the death of his daughter,” a spokesperson for the Illinois Democrat told the Daily Caller News Foundation in a statement. “He followed every rule and every filing requirement laid out by the State of Illinois.”“At a moment like this, he hopes his colleagues, especially those who speak about family values, can show the same compassion and respect that any family would want during a health crisis. Congressman García remains committed to finishing his term with dignity and continuing his lifelong fight for working families,” the spokesperson’s statement continued.\n\nGarcia, 69, filed for reelection on Oct. 27 before announcing after the filing deadline had passed that he would not pursue a fourth term. His chief of staff filed to run on Nov. 3 at 5 p.m before the deadline closed at midnight, which effectively gave no other candidate the opportunity to challenge her.\n\nGarcia has represented the west side of Chicago for three terms in a safe blue seat since 2019, before announcing his retirement on Nov. 4.\n\nGarcia’s widely-criticized succession plan comes after Democrats came under fire for anointing former Vice President Kamala Harris as their 2024 presidential nominee without holding another primary following former President Joe Biden suspending his campaign.\n\nAndi Shae Napier contributed to this report. \n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Mickelson shared his opinions in a series of social media posts Wednesday. In one post, the golfer reshared a photo showing prices at a gas station in California exceeding $5 per gallon. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM \"This is sad and going to get worse,\" Mickelson wrote. In a subsequent post, Mickelson reshared an interview of Hilton on the Fox Business Network's \"The Bottom Line,\" where the candidate shared his support for the White House's plan to carry out off-shore oil drilling off the coast of California. Hilton said his plan and goal is to bring gas prices down to $3 per gallon. \"Finally, someone speaking common sense,\" Mickelson wrote. Earlier this year, an analysis by University of Southern California professor Michael Mische suggested Californians could end up paying as much as $8.43 per gallon of gas next year as two refineries in the state have plans to shutter.

Any disruptions to maritime markets, routes, ports, operations, etc., will have a significant effect on California gasoline security and consumer prices, as well as prices in Nevada and Arizona,\" Mische wrote in May. Meanwhile, Valero Energy Corp. announced that it will likely close its Benicia refinery near San Francisco in April 2026, putting more than 400 jobs in jeopardy and potentially raising prices even more. Hilton, who is a top GOP contender for governor in 2026, has made addressing gas prices a key promise of his campaign. \"Despite our state's plentiful oil reserves, Californians are forced by Democrat 'climate' policies to pay the nation’s highest gas prices (now around $5.00 per gallon), surpassing even Hawaii, in the middle of the Pacific Ocean,\" Hilton wrote in a Fox News Digital op-ed in June. \"California’s sky-high gas prices are the direct result of 15 years of one-party Democratic rule. Gavin Newsom, former Vice President Kamala Harris and every other leading Democrat in the state have been cheerleaders for this ‘war on fossil fuels,’ endlessly bragging about \"leading the world\" on climate change.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Meanwhile, Mickelson has been active on social media this year in bringing awareness to various socio-political issues pushed by leftist policies and lawmakers, while praising conservatives like President Donald Trump, the late Charlie Kirk and now Hilton.

He doesn't want Yes men, and I think that's one of the reasons why you guys have a great relationship because you're always thinking about how can I actually give the president the best counsel.\n\nBut then, the second thing is, when the president makes a decision, it's your job to execute. It's not to run to the papers and say, \"Well, actually, I disagreed with this decision,\" or run to the Congress and badmouth the administration, it's to execute.\n\nAnd I think the reason why the president has trust in me, Is because, yes, I absolutely tell the president what I think about a given issue. But I also recognize, I'm the vice president, he's the president, and when the President of the United States makes the decision, it's time to go and get it done. In part because I get things done. Right? Sometimes Congress doesn't cooperate, sometimes the private sector doesn't cooperate, Like, I'm not saying any of us have a batting average of 1000. \n\nBut what I think all of us who have earned the president's trust do, is that when the administration makes a decision, when he makes a decision, we actually go out and get it done. And that's why this job has been so empowering for me is that the president trusts me, he knows I'm going to give him honest counsel, he knows that if he asks me to get something done, I'm going to try my best to actually go and do it. And that's why whe have a good partnership, I think that's why the administration has been so effective this time around, is because there's a lot of people with a very wide diversity of opinions, but we get out there and we try to do the best job for the American people and the President of the United States. And because of that, there's a lot of trust and a lot of affection in the cabinet.\n\nI mean, you've seen this, I've seen this. But when we're sitting in there, and the cameras are off, and we're just talking about an issue, there is a deep level of affection and trust between all the senior members of the team. I don't know how it's possible to do this job without it, but I know it's why we've been so successful in the past 10 months.","url":"https://redstate.com/jenniferoo/2025/11/12/vp-jd-vance-speaks-at-the-first-ever-maha-summit-n2196122","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2025/316/ae8a26d0-0e63-441f-bd75-7c2c5fb4a3ef.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-13 00:31:17","author":"Jennifer Oliver O'connell","authors":["Jennifer Oliver O'connell"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.238},{"id":378408692,"title":"The Epstein email receipts show sex offender’s deep reach in Washington went far beyond Trump","text":"The former prince, Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, fell into disgrace after it was revealed that he kept in contact with Jeffrey Epstein after the financier was convicted of sex crimes in 2008 in a “sweetheart deal” that largely allowed him to escape judgment for his crimes.\n\nBut were Washington’s elite held to those same standards, there would be plenty of disgrace to go around.\n\nOn Wednesday, another trove of email chains involving Jeffrey Epstein and his former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, was released by the House Oversight Committee’s members, which include both Republicans and Democrats.
