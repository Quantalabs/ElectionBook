As a native of Indiana with family still there, I felt “Indiana” could be substituted freely for “Arkansas” throughout.\n\nCalifornia has its challenges, but the struggle is on the right path; in the right direction. California is a national model, and as a decades-long resident now, I can share that there’s no going back. Californians who begin to believe the propaganda that the state is a “hellscape” should visit other states for a fresh perspective on personal freedoms, multicultural creative arts, land conservation and recreation space, and adoption of EVs, among other benefits California has over so many states.\n\nCraig Riebersal\nWalnut Creek\n\nRefreshingly positive\ntake on state in op-ed\n\nRe: “Ignore haters, California is a national model” (Page A6, June 25).\n\nI found it enlightening and refreshing to read the “Arkansan’s Perspective,” which examined the many criticisms often heard about our state. I’ve often been dismayed to hear the frequent California bashing, both here at home and on a nationwide level. The writer’s unique perspective as a new resident to our state offers a more positive outlook than we usually see, especially when contrasted with the rest of the country, and in particular, their former home state of Arkansas. Thank you for giving us a positive perspective for a change.\n\nJennifer Kline\n\nStop watering down\nhousing bill and pass it\n\nRe: “Senate passes housing measure” (Page B1, June 5).\n\nThe housing crisis in California requires policy solutions, not symbolic action. That is why SB 79 is critically important.\n\nThe bill proposes removing some height limitations and up-zoning areas near transit hubs, and also stops abuses of CEQA for said projects. But now SB 79 is endangered by the state Assembly, and lawmakers may continue to weaken the bill, including killing the CEQA limits. Curbing SB 79 is the apotheosis of California’s hypocritical self-professed commitment to “progressive values.” How can California claim to address poverty and climate change while protecting policies that displace workers and keep housing unaffordable?\n\nThe amended bill that barely survived the Senate is already a compromise; if we continue to strip it down, it will lose its effect. The Assembly should pass SB 79 as previously proposed without further concessions, and Gov. Newsom should sign it.\n\nJonathan Hofer\n\nPressure legislators to\nchange immigration law\n\nSo many of us don’t agree with many things that ICE is doing, yet they are doing what they are supposed to be doing: following the law.\n\nAs law enforcement officials, they and the other police agencies that work with them are enforcing what our lawmakers have declared illegal. That’s not Donald Trump. That’s our representatives and senators in Congress. In looking up where they stand, I was not able to find our California legislators stepping forth to change the law so that ICE is no longer an issue.\n\nOur legislators are in hiding.

During an appearance on “Kudlow,” Adams pointed out what he referred to as Mamdani’s lack of legislative success during his tenure in Albany.\n\n“He’s an assemblyman. He didn’t do it when he was in Albany. He had the power to do many of the things he stated now after four years in Albany. He did not pass one bill. So either he doesn’t understand the role of a mayor or he’s intentionally misleading people who are looking for help around [the] affordability issue,” Adams said.\n\nAdams discussed another way he said he and Mamdani differ from one another.\n\n“Are we facing one who wants to defund our police or one who believes that law enforcement is a prerequisite to our prosperity? And one that understands that a healthy financial ecosystem includes bringing in large companies to hire everyday employees so that they could have a quality of life? And I think what is most troubling about what the socialist candidate is stating is his calls to give everything away free,” Adams told Larry Kudlow. “Nothing is more troubling when people who are struggling are giving promises that individuals can’t live up to. Mayors don’t have the power to raise income taxes. That is, what is the basis of all the things he’s going to pay for? Assemblymen have that power.”\n\nMamdani vowed on Wednesday to increase funding for hate crime programs in the city by 800% to help “root out” antisemitism. Mamdani addressed concerns about his stance on Israel during his conversation with Jen Psaki. (RELATED: Kamala Harris’ Stepdaughter Says She Had To Overcome ‘Trauma’ Of Voting To Back Socialist Candidate In NYC)\n\n“My message is that I am looking to lead this entire city, to represent each and every New Yorker. And that representation is not contingent on whether or not someone votes for me or someone agrees with me, because the responsibility of a leader is to reach out to all eight and a half million people who call this city their home,” Mamdani said.\n\nMamdani has campaigned on a progressive platform, advocating for taxpayer-funded initiatives like free public transportation, childcare, and city-operated grocery stores. The Democratic lawmaker has also pushed for reducing police presence in New York City and has faced significant criticism for his strong anti-Israel views.\n\nMamdani has served in the New York State Assembly since Jan. 1, 2021, representing the 36th District in Queens. He has faced criticism for his legislative record. He has been absent for 50% of Assembly votes in 2025, the highest absentee rate among all members. Additionally, some of his ambitious proposals, such as universal childcare and fare-free transit, have not advanced through the legislative process.\n\nDespite serving in the New York State Assembly since 2021, Mamdani has struggled to pass significant legislation. Adams’ claim that Mamdani “did not pass one bill” is not entirely accurate, however. While Mamdani has introduced over 20 bills, only three —the State Administrative Procedure Act (A6267), the “Not on Our Dime!” Act (A6101), and the “Fix the MTA Act” (A6044)— were signed into law.\n\nThe State Administrative Procedure Act (A6267) promotes transparency in government rulemaking. The “Not on Our Dime!” Act (A6101) restricts state funding for organizations that support Israeli settlements. The “Fix the MTA Act” (A6044) piloted fare-free bus services in New York City.\n\nMamdani’s office did not immediately respond to the DCNF’s request for comment.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

In a letter obtained by Fox News Digital, SBA Administrator Kelly Loeffler said the scale of the USAID fraud is a \"damning reflection of systemic failures in oversight and accountability.\" She further said that the fraud \"was not an isolated incident.\" In response, Loeffler instructed Associate Administrator Tre Pennie, who oversees government contracts awarded by SBA, to \"act decisively\" to crack down on any potential similar abuses in the agency. Loeffler instructed Pennie to immediately initiate a full-scale audit of the agency’s awarding officers back to 2010. DEM SENATOR ACCUSES TOP TRUMP OFFICIAL OF BEING RESPONSIBLE FOR ‘HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN DYING’ \"The role of federal government contracting officers is not ceremonial or self-dealing; rather, it is a position of immense authority and fiduciary responsibility,\" said Loeffler. \"The contracting process must be transparent and built on merit, not personal gain.\" This comes after USAID, an agency tasked with administering civilian foreign aid, was essentially dismantled by the DOGE waste, fraud and abuse cuts made under Elon Musk and President Donald Trump. The move was met with massive protests from Democrats who claimed that cutting USAID would impoverish and harm recipients across the globe. Despite claims of how much good the agency was doing, it was recently discovered that an influential contracting officer at USAID named Roderick Watson was able to carry out a massive, long-term bribery scheme dating all the way back to 2013. Watson, 57, pleaded guilty to \"bribery of a public official,\" according to a DOJ press release. TOP DEM DEMANDS ANSWERS FROM SOCIAL SECURITY, CLAIMING WAIT TIMES SPIKED DURING DOGE CUTS According to the DOJ, Watson sold his influence starting in 2013, with contractors Walter Barnes, owner of Vistant, and Darryl Britt, owner of Apprio, funneling payoffs through subcontractor Paul Young to hide their tracks. A DOJ press release said that Britt and Barnes \"regularly funneled bribes to Watson, including cash, laptops, thousands of dollars in tickets to a suite at an NBA game, a country club wedding, downpayments on two residential mortgages, cellular phones, and jobs for relatives. The bribes were also often concealed through electronic bank transfers falsely listing Watson on payroll, incorporated shell companies, and false invoices.\" The statement said that Watson is alleged to have received bribes \"valued at more than approximately $1 million as part of the scheme.\" Vistant was awarded in November 2023, as part of a joint venture, a contract worth up to $800 million with one of the focuses of that contract being to address \"a variety of issues affecting the root causes of irregular migration from Central America to the United States,\" an issue that President Joe Biden tasked then-Vice President Kamala Harris with during his presidency. ‘FOR SALE’: DOGE MOVES TO SELL OFF ALMOST HALF A BILLION IN FEDERAL REAL ESTATE, RELOCATE CABINET AGENCY HQS Several days later, that contract was canceled after USAID published a notice that said Vistant was excluded from government contracting due to \"evidence of conduct of a lack of business honesty or integrity.\" The joint venture then successfully sued the government over being put on that exclusion list and was re-awarded the contract and given a $10,000 payment in August 2024. In her letter, Loeffler said the USAID scandal \"represents a collapse in the very safeguards that are supposed to protect American taxpayer dollars and ensure fair access for legitimate small businesses.\" She slammed the Biden administration for awarding the $800 million contract to Vistant despite the business being labeled by USAID as lacking \"honesty and integrity.\" \"The fact that a federal official was able to act as the linchpin of a persistent, large-scale fraud operation speaks to a failure in internal controls and a breakdown in the contracting environment that demands immediate correction,\" said Loeffler.

Any officials or businesses found in violation of the SBA’s ethical standards or who have committed criminal misconduct will be referred to the appropriate authorities and SBA will assist the DOJ in recovering misappropriated funds, Loeffler said. \"We will not allow public trust to be quietly eroded by backdoor deals and unchecked discretion,\" said Loeffler. \"We owe it to America’s small businesses to get this right,\" she went on. \"Your office has the authority, and now the mandate, to act decisively.\"","summary":"Following the uncovering of a massive bribery scandal at USAID, SBA chief Kelly Loeffler is ordering a full audit of all government contracting officers over the last 15 years.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/exclusive-trump-admin-takes-action-after-massive-fraud-uncovered-agency-dems-tried-protect-from-doge","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/06/931/523/loeffler-usaid.png?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-26 22:54:43","author":"Andrew Miller,Peter Pinedo","authors":["Andrew Miller","Peter Pinedo"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.211},{"id":335618476,"title":"Are Democrats abandoning Newsom’s “California Way”?","text":"“The Seven Year Itch” is not only a great Marilyn Monroe movie, but a natural occurrence for California governors and legislators of the same party in the seventh year of an eight-year administration. \n\nGovernors dominate legislators for most of their tenure, then lawmakers begin to push back and act more independently in the seventh year of a governor’s term, typically on budget priorities.\n\nHowever, new legislation from a group of legislative Democrats to overhaul the forthcoming update of the Low Carbon Fuel Standard is more than the 2025 remake of a Billy Wilder classic. \n\nIt’s Democrats abandoning what Gov. Gavin Newsom calls “The California Way.”\n\nThe California Way is Newsom’s governing philosophy and policy agenda. It dictates, for example, what kinds of cars people must buy and appliances they must use. It puts blind faith in government green mandates typified by the Low Carbon Fuel Standard. And it empowers unelected bureaucrats like the state Air Resources Board, who unwaveringly enforce a costly agenda that hurts Californians struggling to make ends meet. \n\nGreen mandates like the Low Carbon Fuel Standard impose huge costs on working class and minority communities and those living in inland and central California. These are core constituencies for Democratic lawmakers at risk of losing their seats.\n\nTheir worry grows when they read the Air Resources Board’s own assessment forecast that the new standard could raise gas prices by 47 cents per gallon. A recent USC study found that Newsom’s green mandates – which also triggered the forthcoming closure of two major state refineries – could see state gas prices surpass $8 per gallon by 2026.\n\nThe Air Resources Board chair recently admitted at a legislative hearing that the board does not analyze the impact of its policies on consumers. Afterward, a Democratic Assemblywoman from a district where President Donald Trump and then-Vice President Kamala Harris virtually tied called for her resignation.\n\nFor his part, Newsom has been unmoved, shifting the blame for high gas prices to “big oil.” In a November visit to Fresno, he “rejected the notion that gas prices will see a sudden spike related to the air board’s decision” despite the overwhelming data to the contrary. \n\nHe went through the charade of a special legislative session to investigate why California gas prices are so high (hint: it’s his policies). Just a few weeks ago, he signed an executive order doubling down on his unrealistic electric vehicle mandates, which will make the cost of driving more expensive. This is part of a green energy transition that will cost California families upwards of $20,000 each according to a recent Pacific Research Institute study. And much to the chagrin of fellow Democrats, he’s refused to block the Low Carbon Fuel Standard update.\n\nVoters who stand to be harmed the most economically by Newsom’s green policies are, not surprisingly, voters in swing districts. These areas moved sharply red in the 2024 election as Democrats lost three legislative seats. \n\n by nearly 10 points. With her seat at risk again, it’s no coincidence that Hurtado is now a joint author of the legislation to dump Newsom’s green agenda. \n\nWith 64 percent of Latinos saying that price increases have caused financial hardship for their households in the latest poll from the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California – this mini rebellion from Capitol Democrats won’t be the last.\n\nExpect to see other Democrats facing heat from constituents move quickly to throw Newsom’s policy agenda under the bus. Unless these lawmakers make good on promises to lower the cost of living and stop higher gas and energy prices from becoming the California Way, they may join their departed colleagues in losing their seats in 2026.\n\nTim Anaya is the Pacific Research Institute’s vice president of marketing and communications and co-author of The California Left Coast Survivor’s Guide.","summary":"Expect to see other Democrats facing heat from constituents move quickly to throw Newsom’s policy agenda under the bus.","url":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/06/26/are-democrats-abandoning-newsoms-california-way/","image":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CALIFORNIA_PRESUPUESTO_08074.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-26 22:28:21","author":"Gqlshare,Tim Anaya","authors":["Gqlshare","Tim Anaya"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.154},{"id":335615316,"title":"Washington Democrats don’t know whether to panic or surrender to left-wing Mamdani’s playbook after NYC race shocker","text":"Whatever you do, don’t extrapolate this result!\n\nDemocrats in Washington and the media were falling over each other on Wednesday and Thursday to insist that the party as a whole should not follow the democratic socialist bent of Zohran Mamdani after the 33-year-old pulled off an upset victory in the New York mayoral primary. Defying the polls, Mamdani beat former governor Andrew Cuomo in the first round of voting — even as Cuomo’s camp went into the day boasting of being ahead.\n\nMamdani, they argue, does not provide a policy mold for other Democrats to fit themselves into, given New York’s status as a deep-blue stronghold where a Republican is largely assumed to have no shot of winning in November.\n\nThey’re correct about the electorate itself not being representative of the country as a whole. But the panic among a certain generation of Democrats, especially in the days leading up to Mamdani’s victory, is indicative of a party elite with some glaring vulnerabilities that were once again laid bare on Tuesday.\n\nEleven months after former President Joe Biden stepped down from his re-election bid and forced his party into an accelerated catch-up sprint with around 100 days to go, the party’s centrist establishment once again pinned all of their hopes (and cash) on an unpopular, aging statesman beset by ethical concerns.\n\nGuess what happened next?\n\nNot even a massive onslaught of Michael Bloomberg’s wealth could save Cuomo, who remained well behind Mamdani throughout the night as votes were counted. None of the multitude of Democrats who once called on Cuomo to resign over sexual misconduct allegations could give a clear explanation for their change of heart — or why they weren’t backing one of Mamdani’s numerous other rivals.\n\nAxios’s Alex Thompson, speaking on After Party with Emily Jashinsky, described the mindset of party leadership, whom he said told voters: “This is the best candidate. Eat your vegetables.”\n\nFor the second time in as many years, it didn’t work.\n\nWith a new reality setting in, the party’s caucuses in Washington are split over how to view Mamdani, who now is very likely to become one of the most prominent Democratic politicians in the country. Progressives, of course, are openly embracing him. A few members of the party’s establishment have come around as well, like Rep. Jerry Nadler, who endorsed him on Thursday.\n\nOthers have not.\n\nHakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer, both from New York and the two highest-ranking Democrats on the hill, have not made official endorsements of Mamdani’s campaign for the general election (yet). Both are facing calls from prominent progressives to be challenged in their own primaries next year. Tom Suozzi, a Democrat in a front line district in the state, openly tweeted his reservations about the state assemblyman after his victory.\n\nThe coverage of the race clearly plays a role here. Even as Mamdani himself was laser-focused on the issue of affordability in New York City, his association with the Democratic Socialists of America and his opposition to Israel’s war in Gaza received an intense focus from a controversy-hungry mainstream political press. Even Mamdani’s joint interview with cross-endorser Brad Lander on Stephen Colbert’s Late Show was dominated by talk about Israel and Palestine.\n\nFront-line Democrats still fear any association with their party’s far-left, whom they mainly view as a punching bag in tough election years. And party leaders in Washington still feel they have to cater to those representatives and senators, whose fates are so closely tied to the party’s ability to fundraise in future cycles.\n\nA larger coalition, however, is taking some non-controversial lessons from Mamdani’s victory — or, at least, lessons that would be non-controversial anywhere besides the Democratic Party.\n\nVoters, they argue, were certain to back the younger candidate less tied to the party’s establishment in a year when more and more voters (especially millennials, who were a leading part of Mamdani’s voter coalition) have lost faith in the party’s establishment to lead themselves, let alone anyone else.\n\nThey were also less likely to pick a candidate with such obvious baggage as Cuomo under the argument that a former governor who resigned in disgrace under a cloud of allegations was somehow the stronger pick come November. Especially when the city’s voters were already weary of the evolving scandal around Mayor Eric Adams, who dropped out of the Democratic primary while under a corruption probe.\n\nProgressives and moderates cease their agreement after this point. The party’s centrists will argue that the successful characteristics of Mamdani’s appeal can be replicated in a candidate outside of the party’s left wing. Progressives disagree, claiming that the kind of personal connection to voters only exists among more populist candidates, especially younger ones. They also point to Mamdani’s massive army of volunteers, which they argue is directly tied to lefty organizations like DSA.\n\nAnd they argue that Cuomo, like Joe Biden and Kamala Harris before him, couldn’t articulate a vision for their governance at all\n\nIf nothing else, Tuesday’s election results in New York sent one clear message to party leaders. Their efforts to shut out the progressive wing by throwing big-name endorsements and the crushing weight of big donor money behind weak candidates who have seen too many election cycles will increasingly be met with failure, unless the party can actually convince voters that the center-left has an exciting bench of charismatic younger leaders to pick up the torch.","summary":"Some Democrats say there are lessons to be learned from Zohran Mamdani, even without copying his policies.

I hope former resident President Donald Trump won’t be bailing them out.\n\nThis week, Mayor Eric Adams called Mamdani a “snake oil salesman.” Adams is right, but he must explain why Mamdani is a fraud. Mamdani’s smooth talking and slick videos don’t make his economic theories any less absurd. If he gets his way, he will increase tolerance for antisemitism, be soft on crime, and drive even more to government dependence. He wants to turn one of the most vibrant cities in America into Havana, where residents drive cars from the 1950s, and nearly 90% of residents suffer from “extreme poverty.”\n\nDemocrats are going to do everything they can to get Mamdani elected.

My mother was considered to be a part of this movement, along with women like Betty Friedan, author of the groundbreaking book The Feminine Mystique, and trailblazers such as Gloria Steinem and Germaine Greer.\nThis line of questioning, to me, sort of implies that second-wave feminism was, in some ways, a failure—because one of its biggest achievements, Roe, was overturned three years ago this week by the Dobbs decision. Perhaps this kind of grim conversation always happens in those dark moments when it seems like progress is ebbing rather than flowing.\nOver the past near decade, we’ve witnessed two hypercompetent, accomplished women, Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris, lose to Donald Trump, a man who has faced dozens of sexual misconduct complaints (which he denies). We’ve seen these women be subjected to vicious sexist attacks; Trump ally Laura Loomer, for one, called Harris “an escort,” while internet men were delighted to call her a “ho.”\nReflecting on the impact of the Dobbs decision, Harris acknowledged to Vanity Fair on Monday that “young women today will have fewer rights than their mothers and grandmothers.” Indeed, the post-Roe landscape is especially bleak. A Georgia woman, Adriana Smith, was finally taken off life support last week after delivering a 1-pound, 13-ounce baby. She’d been considered brain-dead since February, but hadn’t been allowed to die because the doctors feared that would be in violation of Georgia’s law banning abortion after the detection of fetal cardiac activity.\nAround the country, women have been criminally charged or left to bleed out, with some even dying, because of Republican lawmakers’ extreme abortion bans. Women in Texas experienced a “nearly seven-percentage-point increase in frequent mental distress associated with the state’s severe abortion restrictions beginning in 2021,” according to Axios, which cited a study in JAMA Network Open. Meanwhile, the conservative-majority Supreme Court isn’t done targeting reproductive rights, ruling Thursday that states can cut off Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood.\nHarvey Weinstein’s New York rape conviction was overturned (though a jury in the state convicted him of sexual assault earlier this month), while Brett Kavanaugh, who denied sexual misconduct claims during confirmation hearings, sits on the Supreme Court. And, of course, Trump was reelected.\nPerhaps that’s why Andrew Cuomo thought he would run for mayor. After all, if Trump could outrun the allegations of some 26 women, and having been found liable for sexual abuse in a civil case, perhaps he could do something similar. Cuomo left office in disagrace amid sexual harassment allegations, which he denied, but in running for mayor, he contended that he never should’ve resigned as governor.\nSome MeToo’d men have clawed their way back into the culture and media in recent years; others have not. Either way, Democratic voters’ rejection of Cuomo this week is a good sign for feminism, and for the party, with the latter distinguishing itself from the GOP, which seems perfectly fine with having men accused of sexual misconduct carry on in high-level government roles.\nThough Republicans were able to overturn Roe, that doesn’t mean that the legacy of these second-wave feminists is lost, as they paved the way for what women are able to do today. Betty Friedan wrote so that I could tweet. Gloria Steinem went undercover at the Playboy Club so that Lydia Polgreen could do her intrepid reporting. Shirley Chisholm ran for president so that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez could run for Congress.\nSo while it may feel, at times, like we’re going backward, the first step forward may be to acknowledge, and appreciate, what these feminists fought for, and forge ahead.","summary":"Reflecting on the second-wave feminists’ legacy in these uncertain times.","url":"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/roe-v-wade-2025","image":"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/685d7a9e6d390beaad3da442/16:9/w_2000,h_1125,c_limit/second-wave-feminism.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-26 21:24:28","author":"Molly Jong-Fast","authors":["Molly Jong-Fast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.035},{"id":335626254,"title":"Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez are ALREADY married: As bride appears in terrifyingly tight corset for star-studded Venice wedding party, insiders tell ALISON BOSHOFF the couple tied the knot a month ago","text":"The Bezos wedding began on Thursday with the first of three days of parties in Venice – but impeccable sources reveal that the Amazon founder and journalist-turned-philanthropist Lauren Sanchez are already married.\n\nA source closely connected to the organisation of the week's events said: 'They have been married for at least a month, more than a month.\n\n'The marriage is fully legal and took place in America under American law.'\n\nThe source adds: 'When they were planning the wedding, they were clear about the fact that they were already secretly married.\n\n'There is no application for a wedding licence from the couple because it was not required.\n\n'Whatever happens at the wedding on Friday, it will not be a wedding. Under Italian law, it will not be a wedding celebration, any vows said or rings exchanged will have no legal meaning.'\n\nThe source added that Bezos had personally confirmed that he and Sanchez – who met when both were married to other people – are already legally married, and that they had also signed a pre-nuptial agreement to protect his $244 billion (£177 billion) fortune. \n\nBut Venice will still see a party unlike any other. Amid local protests, celebrities, politicians and business titans have gathered in the city known, ironically given the disruption, as La Serenissima, the Most Serene Republic of Venice.\n\nAs the eyes of the world focused on the event, staff at the privately owned Madonna dell Orto cloisters - where the couple held their 'eve of' reception tonight with finger food and pizza - erected tents to stop overflying drones from picturing the guests. Policemen on jetskis meanwhile patrolled the entrance to the nearest canal.\n\nIt's thought that the event included speeches from the bride to the groom and vice versa.\n\nThe two three star hotels neighbouring the cloister were booked up to house the 150 staff who are working on the wedding. The guests are staying rather more comfortably at the five star Aman, The Gritti Palace and the Cipriani.\n\nSome of the world's most eligible bachelors are in Venice for the wedding – Orlando Bloom, freshly split from fiancée Katy Perry; divorced sporting superstar Tom Brady, and divorced talent agent and billionaire music executive Scooter Braun.\n\nFormer US President Barack Obama was among guests – he and Bezos have been on warm terms for years, and Bezos donated $100 million (£72 million) to the Obama Foundation in 2021.\n\nThe event has attracted a near-quorum of Kardashians. Matriarch Kris Jenner is close friends with Lauren Sanchez, while daughters Kim and Khloe were also in attendance. Kylie Jenner, her daughter by Olympic athlete Caitlin, arrived at the Gritti Palace hotel on Thursday afternoon. Make up tycoon Kylie doesn't travel light: her 25 pieces of monogrammed luggage were on a water taxi following behind her. \n\nOthers attending include former chat show host Oprah Winfrey and her best friend, TV presenter and author Gayle King, who went on the much-mocked space 'flight' on Bezos Blue Origin rocket last month with Sanchez and an all-female team.\n\nDonald Trump's daughter Ivanka is attending along with husband Jared Kushner, but the President himself – reportedly invited – will not come to Venice.\n\nBoth Bezos and Sanchez were there for Trump's inauguration earlier this year and Bezos attracted much criticism when his Washington Post newspaper declined to endorse Democratic candidate Kamala Harris in the US election last year.\n\nQueen Rania of Jordan has also been seen, as have fashion duo Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana.\n\nThe build-up has not gone smoothly, however. Plans were ripped up and remade over the past week as the bride and groom reeled from public hostility to their descent on Venice, and responded to global political turbulence following US airstrikes in Iran.\n\nThey have now left their $500 million (£363 million) yacht, the Koru, off the coast of Croatia, although it was initially intended to be moored in Venice.\n\nThe venues for the various celebrations have changed, too, with plans for Saturday's party now moved to Arsenale, the shipbuilding yards, which are easier to make secure. It is thought that singer-songwriter Usher, who also arrived today, may be performing. Reports that Sir Elton John and Lady Gaga will sing have been denied by representatives for both.\n\nProtests by disgruntled locals continue, and are planned tonight and throughout the wedding. Sources says that Mayor Luigi Brugnaro has assured the couple that he can guarantee their safety in the middle of the city, however – hence tonight's event at the Madonna dell Orto in the heart of Venice.\n\n'The feeling was that the protests started to die down on Monday, so this was possible,' said one.\n\nForty people were held by police after Extinction Rebellion held a small protest in St Mark's Square on Thursday morning.\n\nOn Thursday lunchtime, the couple and a few of their guests enjoyed a private lunch in the gardens of the Villa Baslini on the tiny island of San Giovanni Evangelista.\n\nThe island offers perfect privacy and the couple were able to totally evade the army of paparazzo who have descended on Venice.\n\nMeanwhile preparations also continued at the Arsenale – in warehouse 91 to be specific - which was the last-minute switch of venue for Saturday night's grand ball, from Scuola della Misericordia, after protesters said they would dive into the bordering canal.\n\nOne staff member said: 'I can tell you that [warehouse 91 is] a beautiful location. All the tables have a wonderful flower display, and they are putting up large chandeliers in the ceiling – it's going to have a Venetian masked ball theme is what I have heard but we've been told no photos, and we have to leave our phones with security.'\n\nThe main event will be on the island of San Giorgio Maggiore, run by the Cini Foundation, on Friday. Bezos and Sanchez are due to say their vows in the restored amphitheatre on the island while Matteo Bocelli, the son of tenor Andrea, sings.\n\nA budget of 1,000 Euros a head has been set for the wedding breakfast and according to local reports it will include the local Venetian delicacy of cuttlefish stew.\n\nThe celebrations began on Wednesday evening with a drinks reception in the ballroom of the stunning 16th century Aman hotel, in one of Venice's most venerable palazzos, which overlooks the Grand Canal.\n\nThen the wedding guests including Bezos and Sanchez made their way to a private dinner party at the Palazzo Brandolini, hosted by Diane von Furstenberg.\n\nThe designer, 77, is close to the bride and groom to be, with her husband, the mogul Barry Diller, serving as a mentor and inspiration to Jeff Bezos for the past decade. Diller said in an interview that Bezos is a 'very dear, very loving friend' and has also been vocal in his admiration for Sanchez, a former local TV anchor and helicopter pilot.\n\nThe party was in Diane's Venetian home, which occupies the second floor of the spectacular 15th century palazzo, filled with mirrors, gilding and frescoes. The magazine Architectural Digest visited last year and described it as 'stupendous' – and they are not easily impressed.\n\nVon Furstenberg and Diller live for several months of the year at the Palazzo Brandolini, and it's here that she displays her priceless series of paintings of her by Andy Warhol, dating from 1974.\n\nVon Furstenberg and Diller are thought to have first brought Bezos and Sanchez to Venice and introduced them to the charms of that great city – hence their decision to marry here.\n\nAnd their influence on Bezos and Sanchez extends further. Bezos' mega three-masted sailing yacht, the Koru, was inspired by the design of Diller's stunning – but smaller – three masted sailing yacht, Eos.\n\nThe Diller/von Furstenberg couple are deeply involved with the wedding. Cristina Brandolini, the aunt of Diane's first husband Prince Egon, lives in the Palazzo as does her grandson, Marcantonio. He is providing gift glassware for the wedding guests via his company Laguna B.\n\nIt's also thought that the family wine made by Cristina's son Brandolini will be served throughout festivities. The family is intimately connected with fashion and power, with one grandson interning with the Obama White House and another granddaughter working for both Oscar de la Renta and Dolce & Gabbana.\n\nYet even for those who move in such rarified circles, one way or another, the Bezos-Sanchez celebration promises to be an event of a lifetime.","summary":"ALISON BOSHOFF: As the eyes of the world focused on the event, staff at the privately owned Madonna dell Orto cloisters erected tents to stop overflying drones from picturing the guests.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-14851463/Jeff-Bezos-Lauren-Sanchez-MARRIED-Amazon-bride-US.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/26/20/99762375-0-image-m-61_1750964888702.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/06/26/3446773013049134021/1024x576_MP4_3446773013049134021.mp4","publish_date":"2025-06-26 21:08:31","author":"Alison Boshoff,Editor","authors":["Alison Boshoff","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.191},{"id":335602378,"title":"Kamala Harris Lost Because People Voted, Not Because They Didn’t, Research Shows","text":"Instead of sucking up to the political and corporate powers that dominate America, The Daily Caller is fighting for you — our readers.

Despite a very hard-edged promise to boot unauthorized migrants from the country, the new Americans shifted heavily to the president.\n\n“One striking finding came among the roughly 10% of the electorate made up of naturalized citizens: They voted only narrowly for Kamala Harris after backing Joe Biden by about 20 points,” Kondik said, citing the Pew data.\n\nOther of Kondik’s takeaways:\n\n— Trump’s support among Latinos remained strong. “Pew found that 89% of Trump’s 2020 voters turned out in 2024 versus 85% of Joe Biden’s. But among Latinos, the pro-Trump turnout dynamic was sharper: 86% of Trump’s 2020 Hispanic voters voted in 2024, versus just 77% of Biden’s.”\n\nSEE THE LATEST POLITICAL NEWS AND BUZZ FROM WASHINGTON SECRETS\n\n— “The Latino shift varies [among Pew and other 2024 reviews], but it was clearly large no matter the source — more than double the overall 2020 to 2024 shift to Trump nationally.

Pew verified whether they had voted or not over the last five presidential elections using publicly available commercial voter files. For context, most well-conducted national polls include roughly 1,000 interviews.\n\nPew asked non-voters how they would have voted and found they would have broken for Trump, 44%-40%. That's a big change from 2020 and 2016 when they said they would have chosen Democrats. In 2020, they said they preferred Joe Biden 46%-35%. In 2016, it was Hillary Clinton, 37%-30%.\n\nThat upends a longstanding belief in politics that higher turnout generally helps Democrats. Younger and non-white voters, who tend to vote Democratic, are also among the least likely to vote.\n\nBut in 2024, Trump's coalition grew – it got more ethnically diverse and younger.\n\nIn 2016, almost 9-in-10 Trump voters were white (88%). In 2024, it was 78%.\n\nMeanwhile, Harris' coalition got whiter – 64% of Harris' voters were white compared to 60% in 2016 for Clinton.\n\nTrump was also able to hold more of his coalition from 2020 than Harris did of Biden's. Trump won 85% of his 2020 voters; Harris won 79% of Biden's.\n\nAbout 15% of Biden's voters did not vote, 5% switched to Trump and 1% voted for someone else. That's compared to 11% of 2020 Trump voters, who sat it out, 3% who switched to Harris and 1% who went for someone else.\n\nPlus, Trump won more of those who didn't vote in 2020 but decided to cast a ballot in 2024. Almost three-quarters of 2020 non-voters stayed home again. But by a 52%-45% margin, Trump won those 2020 nonvoters who voted in 2024.\n\nWhen looking at all eligible voters, including those who stayed home, Trump won 32% of that total population. Harris won 31%.","summary":"In 2024, 64% of the eligible-voting population turned out, the second highest in 120 years.

Although Maine consistently leans Democratic on the presidential level, Collins, with a more moderate voting record than other Republicans, has managed to win over independents and moderate Democrats in recent elections.But Democrats are hoping to flip the seat next year, particularly if the national environment favors the party. Historically, the party in the White House loses seats in the midterms. Collins is viewed as one of the Democrats' top targets, as former Vice President Kamala Harris carried the state by about seven points last November.What to KnowA University of New Hampshire (UNH) poll found that Trump's \"Big Beautiful Bill\" is unpopular among Mainers, only 30 percent of whom support its passage. Fifty-eight percent, on the other hand, say they do not want to see it become law. The bill includes several provisions that would allow Trump and Republicans to significantly overhaul tax and social policies.Among Maine independents—a crucial voting bloc for Collins—72 percent do not want to see it become law, while 21 percent support the bill.Trump is also increasingly unpopular in the Pine Tree State, according to the poll. Sixty percent of respondents disapproved of him, while 40 percent approved of his job performance. In April, he was viewed positively by 42 percent of Mainers, according to UNH.The poll surveyed 846 Maine residents from June 19 to June 23, 2025, and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points.The bill puts Collins in a \"difficult political position,\" Ronald Schmidt, professor of political science at the University of Southern Maine, told Newsweek.\"She has built a base of voters that includes many Independents and some conservative Democrats in the basis of an image of policy independence insofar as the practical needs of Mainers go, and lockstep voting with the president, especially as it regards the needs of seniors, could undermine that image,\" he said.On the other hand, there are some conservatives—particularly in the more right-leaning Second Congressional district—who could \"hold a grudge\" against Collins if she bucked Trump on the bill, he said. They aren't likely to vote for a Democrat in the midterms, but could stay home.Collins is a \"formidable politician\" who has \"weathered many storms,\" Maine Democratic strategist and Bernstein Shur Group managing director David Farmer told Newsweek. However, she has to \"walk a fine line between not alienating Republicans and attracting enough support from non-affiliated voters,\" he said.\"My suspicion is that leadership will free her to vote 'no' unless they absolutely need her vote,\" Farmer said. \"That's something we've seen several times before. While some Republicans have been willing to criticize Sen. Collins' votes and positions, they have always come home to her on Election Day. Independents are the much bigger concern for her re-election prospects.\"Collins thus far has not confirmed how she'll vote on the bill, but has raised concerns about parts of it, particularly about whether it would cut Medicaid. She said in remarks reported by Portland-based news station WMTW in May that she was \"still looking at it because it kept changing up until literally the very minute it passed.\"\"I am looking very carefully at the Medicaid provision, and in particular, I've been very concerned about the impact on children, on people with disabilities, on seniors who are eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid, and for low-income families. The House bill tries to thread the needle. I'm not certain that they succeeded, but I'm still looking at the specifics,\" she said.Congressional Republicans have set a July 4 deadline for the bill's passage, but it has faced roadblocks as lawmakers disagree on key provisions.What People Are SayingFarmer told Newsweek: \"The race is a national target, and there will be a tremendous amount of money spent in the state by both sides. Sen. Collins is one of the toughest politicians in the country and will be difficult to beat. But the anti-Trump climate in Maine is strong, and she will have to fight against that headwind. The race is competitive and will get more so as voters are exposed to the chaos of the Trump administration, the policy impacts on Maine and the unwillingness of Congressional Republicans to address his abuses.\"Collins told reporters in May: \"We don't have to pass the same bill that the House passed, and I don't think we should.\"What Happens NextCollins had not made a formal announcement about her reelection but told CNN in May it is her \"inclination to run\" and that she is \"preparing to do so.\"On the Democratic side, two candidates have declared their intent to run. David Costello, who ran in 2024 and held several different positions in Maryland, including acting secretary of the state's Department of the Environment, is running again. Jordan Wood, who served as chief of staff to former Representative Katie Porter, a California Democrat, is also running.Governor Janet Mills has also not ruled out running, and some Democrats view her as a stronger candidate than those already in the race with deep ties to the state and having already won statewide.","summary":"Only 3 in 10 Maine voters support President Donald Trump's \"Big Beautiful Bill,\" according to a new poll.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/susan-collins-gets-warning-maine-voters-poll-2091265","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2672182/senator-susan-collins-legislation-poll.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-26 18:54:06","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.119},{"id":335560858,"title":"Exclusive: 2024 Election Results Lawsuit Advances as Documents Requested","text":"The lead plaintiff in a legal case questioning the accuracy of the 2024 election, has submitted 15 pages of document requests as part of the discovery process.SMART Legislation, the action arm of nonpartisan watchdog group SMART Elections, also submitted a series of questions to the Rockland County Board of Elections in New York this week, according to court filings reviewed by Newsweek.\"The best way to reassure the public about the accuracy of the election results in Rockland County, New York, is to conduct a full, transparent, hand recount of the 2024 Presidential and Senate elections,\" Lulu Friesdat, the founder and executive director of SMART Legislation, said in a statement to Newsweek. \"That is why we have requested it, and so far, the judge seems to agree.\"A spokesperson for Rockland County told Newsweek it had filed a motion to dismiss, which includes a request for a stay of all discovery.The Context SMART Legislation filed the lawsuit over claims of voting discrepancies in Rockland County, New York. At the heart of alleged discrepancies are voting machines, which have often been the target of claims of irregularities, including when President Donald Trump made unverified claims of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election.Judge Rachel Tanguay of the New York Supreme Court ruled in May that the allegations were serious enough for discovery to proceed. In an order filed earlier this month, Tanguay said all discovery—where the involved parties exchange information and evidence relevant to the case—must be completed within about seven months.The complaint said that more voters had sworn in legal affidavits that they voted for independent U.S. Senate candidate Diane Sare, who is also a plaintiff, than the Board of Elections counted and certified. The complaint also cited numerous statistical anomalies in the election results, including that in multiple districts where hundreds of voters chose the Democratic candidate Kirsten Gillibrand for Senate, none voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate for president.The lawsuit could renew debate about the 2024 election, though it won't change the outcome for any election that has been certified, including the Senate and presidential races.What To KnowThe plaintiffs are seeking evidence about how the 2024 election was conducted due to the irregularities detailed in the initial complaint, according to SMART Legislation's press release.Documents requested include information about voting machines; voter rolls; software; software updates; hardware, including forensic-grade copies of hard drives; diagrams of all equipment, including network and Wi-Fi components; and flash drives that carry election results.The Board of Elections has been asked to provide documents concerning \"any actual or alleged irregularities, errors, problems, or misalignment of election results or voter rolls\" in the 2020 or 2024 general elections, according to documents.The document requests also cover security protocols, such as rules for password creation and chain of custody procedures; lists of workers; financial interactions, such as vendor contracts; and communications with voting machine manufacturers including Elections Systems & Software and testing lab Pro V&V.SMART Elections reported in February that a software update to some ES&S systems were not sufficiently tested. Jack Cobb, the director of the federally accredited testing lab Pro V&V, previously told Newsweek that the changes were not \"of any significance.\"But SMART Legislation said a technical adviser who was consulted disagreed with the testing lab's classification of the updates as minimal, saying it \"is a major change and should require closer inspection as to what the changes are.\"SMART Legislation also asked the Board of Elections to answer questions about modem, Wi-Fi or cellular connections to Rockland County's election systems and to confirm if it has ever used either Starlink satellites' Direct to Cell service or a program known as BallotProof.They also asked if any individual or organization had made any type of complaint or expressed concern about possible inaccuracies in election results from January 1, 2020 to the present.What People Are Saying Lulu Friesdat, the founder and executive director of SMART Legislation, said in a statement provided to Newsweek: \"One of our main concerns at this point is whether the chain of custody of the ballots and the equipment has been robust enough for the public to have confidence in the paper ballots. That is the reason for many of our discovery requests.\"County Attorney Thomas Humbach said in a statement to Newsweek: \"We believe that this claim has no merit, and that the petitioners do not qualify for a recount as a matter of law.\"What's NextThe lawsuit is seeking a full, hand recount of ballots cast in the presidential and U.S. Senate races in Rockland County.The Rockland County Board of Elections will have to response to discovery requests and the questions, and plaintiffs will seek to conduct depositions.The next hearing is scheduled for September 22, and the case is expected to go to trial early next year.","summary":"The lawsuit questions the election results in Rockland County, New York.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/2024-election-results-lawsuit-documents-2091077","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2672050/voters-polls.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-26 18:00:27","author":"Khaleda Rahman","authors":["Khaleda Rahman"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.124},{"id":335557712,"title":"Trump admin ends contracts with publishing giant Springer Nature amid bias, China concerns","text":"The Trump administration has stopped key funding for Springer Nature, the retraction-plagued, controversial publishing behemoth of more than 3,000 scientific and medical journals. Springer Nature publications have long earned subscription revenue from academic and government institutions, but the Trump administration has terminated one key contract and allowed three others to expire, a Trump administration official told Fox News Digital. National Institutes of Health (NIH) and cancer research pacts were deemed \"mission essential\" and therefore will remain intact, Fox News Digital has learned. The Trump administration has cracked down on organizations with perceived political bias, business practices that the president believes misuse U.S. taxpayer dollars and foreign control. TRUMP'S PLAN TO SLASH 'WOKE' FOREIGN AID, NPR FUNDS CLEARS HOUSE AS SENATE BATTLE LOOMS The German-owned Springer Nature was forced to issue 2,923 retractions in 2024, according to Retraction Watch. The publishing giant has also been accused of significantly downplaying the COVID lab-leak theory and censoring content to appease the Chinese government. It also has a \"peer review\" process that critics believe is dominated by woke groupthink. The brand’s popular \"Nature Medicine\" journal was cited frequently in a 2023 congressional report from the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic titled, \"The Proximal Origin of a Cover-up.\" Nature Medicine republished in March 2020 a report from a month earlier in Virological titled \"The proximal origin of SARS-CoV-2\" that concluded the virus was \"not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus.\" \"This is one of the single most impactful and influential scientific papers in history, and it expressed conclusions that were not based on sound science nor in fact, but instead on assumptions,\" the congressional report’s executive summary stated. The Select Subcommittee report even suggested former NIAID director Dr. Anthony Fauci pushed for the publication of the entry that sought to dispel the Wuhan lab-leak theory. Fauci has denied any role in the article and said while he favored the natural-origin theory for the virus, he always had an open mind about the lab leak. In 2017, Springer Nature was \"caught blocking access to academic research in China,\" CNN reported at the time. A spokesperson for Springer Nature brushed off concerns when asked for comment about the Trump administration terminating a contract and allowing others to expire. \"We are proud of our track record in communicating U.S. research to the rest of the world for over a century and continue to have good relationships with U.S. federal agencies,\" a spokesperson for Springer Nature told Fox News Digital. \"We don’t comment on individual contracts, but across our global business there is no material change to our customers or their spend,\" the spokesperson continued. \"We remain confident about the strength of the service we provide.\" Springer Nature did not immediately respond to follow-up questions about political bias, allegedly appeasing China, or use of taxpayer funds. SPRINGER NATURE BLOCKS ACCESS TO ARTICLES IN CHINA The funding termination was first reported by Axios. Axios also reported that the Justice Department formally sent a letter asking a Springer publication about \"its editorial practices and accusing the publishing house of acting as a partisan in scientific debates, as well as wrongfully advocating for positions,\" citing a source with knowledge of the matter. Springer Nature also publishes Scientific American, which endorsed then-Vice President Kamala Harris ahead of the 2024 presidential election. It was only the second time in 179 years that the publication endorsed a candidate for president. \"Before making this endorsement, we evaluated Harris’s record as a U.S. senator and as vice president under Joe Biden, as well as policy proposals she’s made as a presidential candidate. Her opponent, Donald Trump, who was president from 2017 to 2021, also has a record—a disastrous one,\" Scientific American editors wrote. SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN EDITOR APOLOGIZES AFTER BLASTING 'F---ING FASCISTS' WHO ELECTED DONALD TRUMP Springer Nature also practices diversity, equity, and including (DEI) policies, according to its website. The company’s website has a \"diversity commitment\" section that details the publisher’s commitment to \"promoting practices that support diversity and inclusion in science communication and publishing.\" \"As a guiding principle, we aim to foster equity, diversity and inclusion within our internal practices and in published content, embody these values in all our editorial activities and to support and promote these values in the research community,\" the website states. Springer Nature lists its priorities as increasing gender diversity among commissioned authors, and peer reviewer population and editorial board members, while promising to maintain a \"no men-only\" policy at its conferences. Nature magazine also has \"a language sensitivity guide,\" billed as a \"resource of appropriate language to use when writing about topics such as ethnicity, race, gender, sexuality, disability and health\" to ensure \"appropriately diverse representation\" in its pages. \"We are currently developing our commitment on other aspects of diversity, prioritizing ethnic and racial diversity,\" the website states. SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN MAGAZINE FACES CRITICISM AFTER KAMALA HARRIS ENDORSEMENT: 'VERY PROBLEMATIC' At the height of the George Floyd protests in June 2020, the company committed to ending \"anti-Black practices in research.\" The following month it published an editorial recognizing \"the existence of systemic racism in medicine\" and calling for it to stop. Along the way, Springer Nature issued 2,923 retractions in 2024, according to Retraction Watch. Springer Nature noted that the majority were from articles published before 2023. \"61.5% (1797 articles) of retractions were for papers published before January 2023 as part of our commitment to cleaning up the academic record. 38.5% (1126) of retractions were for articles published after January 2023,\" it stated. It also published 482,000 articles in 2024, so there were many that checked out, and Retraction Watch co-founder Ivan Oransky doesn’t believe the correction issue is as alarming as it seems. \"Springer Nature, like all major scientific publishers, has had to retract thousands of papers over the past several years because paper mills and other bad actors have taken advantage of poor quality control,\" Oransky told Fox News Digital. Springer Nature retracted articles for \"compromised peer review process,\" \"inappropriate or irrelevant references,\" and \"citation behavior\" that resulted in the publisher no longer having \"confidence in the results and conclusions\" that were published.

OpenAI, the AI powerhouse backed by Microsoft, has admitted its upcoming artificial intelligence models could help create new bioweapons. Yes, you read that right. The robots are getting clever enough to cook up killer bugs to exterminate humans.\n\nIn a blog post so casual it might as well have come with popcorn, OpenAI revealed it’s racing ahead with AI that could revolutionise biomedical research — and also, potentially, the next global pandemic.\n\n“We feel a duty to walk the tightrope between enabling scientific advancement while maintaining the barrier to harmful information,” the company wrote.\n\nTranslation? They’re inventing digital Frankensteins and hoping the lab doors hold.\n\nAI: from helping doctors to helping doomsday preppers?\n\nOpenAI’s head of safety, Johannes Heidecke, told Axios the company doesn’t believe its current tech can invent new viruses from scratch just yet — but warned the next generation might help “highly skilled actors” replicate known bio-threats with terrifying ease.\n\n“We’re not yet in the world where there’s like novel, completely unknown creation of biothreats that have not existed before,” Heidecke admitted. “We are more worried about replicating things that experts already are very familiar with.”\n\nIn other words, AI isn’t inventing zombie viruses yet — but it might soon become the world’s most helpful lab assistant for bioterrorists.\n\nOpenAI’s bold plan \n\nThe company insists its approach is all about prevention. “We don’t think it’s acceptable to wait and see whether a bio threat event occurs before deciding on a sufficient level of safeguards,” the blog post reads. But critics say that’s exactly what’s happening — build now, worry later.\n\nTo keep the bots from going rogue, Heidecke says their safety systems need to be almost perfect.\n\n“This is not something where like 99 percent or even one in 100,000 performance is sufficient,” he warned.\n\nSounds reassuring… until you remember how often tech goes glitchy.\n\nBiodefence or biotrap?\n\nOpenAI says its models could be used in biodefence. But some experts fear these “defensive” tools could fall into the wrong hands — or be used offensively by the right ones. Just imagine what a government agency with a murky track record could do with AI that knows how to tweak pathogens.\n\nAnd if history has taught us anything, it’s that the road to hell is paved with good scientific intentions.\n\nChatbot of doom? How one AI nearly helped build a bioweapon in 2023\n\nAs reported by Bloomberg, back in late 2023, a former UN weapons inspector walked into a secure White House-adjacent building carrying a small black box. No, this wasn’t a spy movie. It was Washington, and what was inside that box left officials stunned.\n\nThe box held synthetic DNA — the kind that, assembled correctly, could mimic components of a deadly bioweapon. But it wasn’t the contents that shook people. It was how the ingredients had been chosen.\n\nThe inspector, working with AI safety firm Anthropic, had used its chatbot, Claude, to role-play a bioterrorist. The AI not only suggested which pathogens to synthesise, but how to deploy them for maximum damage. It even offered suggestions on where to buy the DNA — and how to avoid getting caught doing so.\n\nAI chatbots and the bioweapon threat\n\nThe team spent over 150 hours probing the bot’s responses. The findings? It didn’t just answer questions — it brainstormed. And that, experts say, is what makes modern chatbots more dangerous than search engines. They’re creative.\n\n“The AI offered ideas they hadn’t even thought to ask,” said Bloomberg journalist Riley Griffin, who broke the story.\n\nThe US government responded weeks later with an executive order demanding tighter oversight of AI and government-funded science. Kamala Harris warned of “AI-formulated bioweapons” capable of endangering millions.\n\nShould AI be regulated like a biohazard?\n\nAs regulators rush to catch up, scientists are urging caution. Over 170 researchers signed a letter promising to use AI responsibly, arguing its potential for medical breakthroughs outweighs the risks.\n\nStill, Casagrande’s findings sparked real concern: AI doesn’t need a lab to do damage — just a laptop and a curious mind.\n\n“The real fear isn’t just AI,” said Griffin. “It’s what happens when AI and synthetic biology collide.”\n\nThe biosecurity blind spot no one’s talking about\n\nSmaller companies handling sensitive biological data weren’t part of those government briefings. That, experts warn, leaves a dangerous blind spot.\n\nAnthropic says it’s patched the vulnerabilities. But the black box moment was a wake-up call: we’re entering an age where chatbots might not just help us cure disease — they might teach us how to spread it.\n\nNot a doomsday scenario yet. But definitely a new kind of arms race.\n\nThis isn’t just a theoretical risk. If models like GPT-5 or beyond end up in the wrong hands, we could be looking at a digital Pandora’s box: instant access to step-by-step instructions for synthesising viruses, altering DNA, or bypassing lab security.\n\n“Those barriers are not absolute,” OpenAI admits. Which, frankly, is the tech equivalent of saying, “The door’s locked — unless someone opens it.”\n\nThe verdict: smarter tech, scarier future?\n\nOpenAI wants to save lives with science. But it’s also inching towards a future where anyone with a laptop and a grudge could play God. Is this innovation — or a slow-motion disaster in progress?\n\nFor now, we’re left with one burning question: If your AI might help someone make a bioweapon, should you really be building it at all?\n\nGet more technology news.\n\nMore US news.","summary":"Playing with fire: OpenAI admits its future AI could help build new bioweapons.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) on Tuesday night, expressing shock that she is viewed favorably in recent polls because “she is a deranged form of Democrat.” Of course, AOC is one of the most prominent Democrats who endorsed Mamdani.\n\nAfter saying he’s “not worried” about his brother’s personal and professional future following the loss in the mayoral race, which saw the ex-governor leading in most polls, the NewsNation anchor then laid out reasons why his brother was handily defeated by Mamdani.\n\n“I get why many of you were surprised by the Democratic primary results in New York City. I was not. Two reasons. One is that it was a low-turnout race that people did not think could go the way it did,” he asserted. \n\n“The enthusiasm and turnout energy were overweighted for the more extreme candidates, as is often the case, and that’s one of the problems with our binary system and with our closed primaries.”\n\nWhile Cuomo claimed that “there were several radical choices” in the Democratic primary, he also insisted that “contrary” to how he was painted during the campaign, “Andrew’s no establishment guy” and the “party was not loving that he ran.” \n\nThe disgraced ex-governor ultimately secured the endorsement of former President Bill Clinton and was bankrolled by a significant portion of the New York business community, including former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg.\n\n“The second reason I wasn’t surprised is actually worth talking about here because it affects the entire nation,” Cuomo further noted. “The Democratic Party is now officially in MAGA mode. We are now, on both sides, in a period of extremism.”\n\nThe comments came as Republicans have spiraled into ugly Islamophobia and even called for Mamdani’s deportation after his stunning victory.\n\nThe ex-CNN star, who recently revealed that he wrote-in his brother’s name on the ballot during the 2024 presidential election rather than vote for Kamala Harris or Donald Trump, continued to make his case that the two major political parties are just as extreme now. \n\nAccording to the 54-year-old TV personality, Democrats have too much sympathy for “extreme” Islamists while demonizing Jewish people. \n\nMamdani, meanwhile, is a Muslim who has been accused of antisemitism by prominent Jewish lawmakers and organizations for declining to condemn the pro-Palestinian slogan “globalize the intifada.” The mayoral candidate, who has been an outspoken critic of Israel in its war with Gaza, has denied those accusations and vowed to fight antisemitism – all while being defended by a lengthy list of Jewish supporters.\n\n“The same way MAGA played with the prejudices of white nationalism, you’re seeing an identical dynamic on the left with prejudices like tacitly supporting extreme Islamism or targeting Jews,” Cuomo proclaimed. “For the right, it’s migrants.

Tommy Tuberville called for the firing of the Senate parliamentarian Thursday over her ruling against a provision in the One Big, Beautiful Bill Act to prevent illegal aliens from accessing Medicaid.\n\n“The WOKE Senate Parliamentarian, who was appointed by Harry Reid and advised Al Gore, just STRUCK DOWN a provision BANNING illegals from stealing Medicaid from American citizens,” wrote Tuberville, R-Ala., on the social media platform X.\n\nThe “big, beautiful bill,” as President Donald Trump calls it, would fulfill a number of campaign promises, such as extending his 2017 first-term tax cuts and funding border security.\n\nTuberville thinks the parliamentarian, Elizabeth MacDonough—essentially the Senate’s rules arbiter—is taking a hatchet to the 10-year fiscal package.\n\n“Unelected bureaucrats think they know better than U.S. congressmen who are elected BY THE PEOPLE. Her job is not to push a woke agenda. THE SENATE PARLIAMENTARIAN SHOULD BE FIRED ASAP.”\n\nMacDonough has the authority to decide whether or not provisions in the budget reconciliation process follow Senate rules.\n\nIn such cases, she is invoking the “Byrd Rule,” which is generally intended to restrict the process to budgetary policy only. The rule is named for then-Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., who was the rule’s main sponsor when it was adopted in 1985.\n\nFiring MacDonough would not be unprecedented.\n\nThen-Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., did so with then-parliamentarian Robert Dove in 2001 over his frequent overruling of Senate budgetary proposals.\n\nNor is Tuberville the first to recommend defying the parliamentarian, who technically serves at the pleasure of the Senate majority leader.\n\nIn 2021, Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., urged then-Vice President Kamala Harris to overrule MacDonough striking a $15 minimum wage provision from the American Rescue Act, a reconciliation package during the Biden administration.\n\n“I’m sorry—an unelected parliamentarian does not get to deprive 32 million Americans the raise they deserve,” Khanna said at the time. “This is an advisory, not a ruling. VP Harris needs to disregard and rule a $15 minimum wage in order.” Harris ultimately did not do so.\n\nRep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., also called for MacDonough’s firing at the time.\n\n“Abolish the filibuster. Replace the parliamentarian,” she said on social media. “What’s a Democratic majority if we can’t pass our priority bills? This is unacceptable.”\n\nRep. Greg Steube, R-Fla., was quick to join in on Tuberville’s criticism Thursday.\n\n“It is time for our elected leaders to take back control. @JDVance should overrule the Parliamentarian and let the will of the people, not some staffer hiding behind Senate procedure, determine the future of this country,” he wrote.\n\nAs presiding officer of the Senate, Vance does hold that power, although using it would break with precedent.\n\nAnother way to address the issue is to amend a provision and resubmit it in the hope that the parliamentarian will let it stand.\n\nRep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo., told The Daily Signal on Wednesday, “I’ve heard from people that are former Senate staffers that it all has to do with what the leader wants to accomplish.”\n\nHe continued, “That if the leader wants something dead, they will write it in such a way that they know that it will die. But yet if they want something to pass, they’ll figure out a way to write it to get it though Byrd.” \n\nRep. Michael Cloud, R-Texas, expressed a similar skepticism Wednesday over the power of the parliamentarian to derail the Republican agenda.\n\n“When we look back two, three generations from now and our kids wonder why [we failed] at doing the fiscal reforms and transformative reforms that need to happen, and the excuse was the Senate parliamentarian, I don’t think that’s a good excuse that would be good enough for our kids. So we’ve got to figure out what it’s going to take to get the reforms that need to happen, the things that we all campaigned on.”\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., viewed the parliamentarian’s new ruling against Medicaid for non-citizens as a dire threat.\n\n“The UN-ELECTED Deep State bureaucrats, radical far left activist judges, and America LAST Democrats are doing everything they can to destroy President Trump and THE PEOPLE’S agenda!!!” she wrote on X.","summary":"Sen.

Pointing to Trump and the Republicans who control Congress, Pritzker argued that \"in Washington, all they’re offering is chaos and craziness.

In Illinois, we solve them.\" In another jab at Trump, Pritzker said, \"We know government ought to stand up for working families and be a force for good, not a weapon of revenge.\" In his video, the governor touted that during his two terms in office, \"we’ve balanced seven straight budgets and got nine credit upgrades. We raised the minimum wage, capped the cost of insulin, banned assault weapons, protected abortion rights, and eliminated the state grocery tax, lowered prescription drug costs and added tens of thousands of jobs.\" However, the Republican Governors Association (RGA) does not see it that way. \"People are fleeing Illinois by the hundreds of thousands and Illinois families continue to suffer the consequences of JB Pritzker’s abject record of failure at home while he spends his time on a national vanity project trying to further his own political career,\" RGA Rapid Response Director Kollin Crompton said in a statement to Fox News.

Pritzker is seen as a potential contender for the Democrats' 2028 presidential nomination – and the launch of his 2026 gubernatorial re-election campaign is not expected to derail him from potentially running for the White House.

Now, following Zohran Mamdani’s seismic victory in the Democratic mayoral primary, the blue remains—but the white appears to fade. The socialist candidate, who supported sanctions on Israel, declined to condemn “globalize the intifada” chants and conquered the Democratic Party in the diaspora’s “capital,” stands on history’s doorstep. Across Borough Park’s Orthodox neighborhoods, Upper East Side family apartments and WhatsApp groups of Israelis in Williamsburg and Park Slope, an unprecedented question emerges: Is New York still ours? The 33-year-old Mamdani—a Muslim Ugandan immigrant raised in a household critical of Israel—closed his victory night with conciliatory remarks directed at Jewish voters alarmed by his campaign. \"I understand we won’t always agree but I will never avoid you. If you’re hurting—I’ll try to heal. If you feel unheard—I’ll seek to understand.\" Later, he told Ynet he intends to be \"a mayor for Muslims and Jews alike, without discrimination.\" Though Mamdani pledged to protect all residents and combat hate crimes—garnering about 20% of Jewish votes—skepticism persists. \"He’s eloquent but unapologetic,\" says Shahar, an Israeli Queens resident. \"When you can’t call ‘intifada’ chants dangerous, you’ve lost me. This isn’t leftism—it’s moral blindness.\" CUNY law professor Jeffrey Lax warned that \"New York is in deep trouble. This is a disaster.\" Avital Chizhik-Goldschmidt, founder of an Upper East Side synagogue, added: \"Apparently softcore antisemitism isn’t a liability for mayoral candidates—it’s an asset.\" Commentator Yehuda Teitelbaum posted on X: \"No clearer proof exists that the diaspora is unsafe for Jews than electing a candidate who openly vowed to ‘globalize the intifada’ in the world’s largest Jewish city outside Israel.\" Some fear a \"mass Jewish exodus.\" Rabbi Marc Schneier (\"rabbi to the stars\"), close to defeated primary rival Andrew Cuomo, told Ynet: \"Mamdani’s win is the greatest existential threat to Jews since notorious antisemite Karl Lueger’s election in Vienna. Jewish leaders must unite to prevent a mass Jewish departure from NYC.\" Lueger—Vienna’s late-19th-century mayor and an ideological influence on Hitler—symbolizes the community’s fear of crossing a historic threshold: from New York as Jewish refuge to a city threatening communal safety. Social media echoed this sentiment, with one user posting: \"We had 100 beautiful years here,\" and podcaster David Bashevkin tweeting \"I💔NY.\" ‘The Mamdani test’: Trump targets the new face of Democrats Veteran Democrats expressed shock after dismissing Mamdani’s chances. \"Running in NYC while refusing to recognize Israel is like running as a pro-choice Republican in Texas. This will haunt him—it’s no way to win,\" scoffed one. But after former U.S. vice president Kamala Harris’ November loss to U.S. President Donald Trump, the search for fresh voices on economic equity—especially housing—propelled Mamdani as a new hope, despite shattering the party’s pro-Israel consensus. \"It’s both blessing and curse,\" said strategist James Carville. \"Every Democrat must now say plainly: Do you support Zohran?\" Mamdani has become a national symbol for the left, with support becoming a loyalty test within the Democratic Party.

A derogatory nickname appears inevitable. Trump launched his first attack on Truth Social: \"The Democrats have crossed the line. Zohran Mamdani, a 100% Communist Lunatic, has just won the Dem Primary, and is on his way to becoming Mayor. “We’ve had Radical Lefties before, but this is getting a little ridiculous. He looks TERRIBLE, his voice is grating, he’s not very smart, he’s got AOC+3, Dummies ALL, backing him, and even our Great Palestinian Senator, Cryin’ Chuck Schumer, is groveling over him. Yes, this is a big moment in the History of our Country!” Coalition upended While the Democratic establishment grapples with its identity, voters spoke: Mamdani won 43.5% to Cuomo’s 36.4% (before ranked-choice tallying). The socialist built an unlikely coalition of wealthy, young, white and educated voters—beating Cuomo by 10%-20% margins in these groups. Conversely, the former governor drew stronger support among Latino, Black, low-income and non-college voters—demographics preferring known quantities despite flaws. Even women favored Cuomo despite past harassment allegations. His campaign, described as \"joyless and weak,\" featured scant field events and failed to connect authentically—unlike Mamdani. The battle now shifts to November’s general election. Incumbent Mayor Eric Adams—a former Democrat popular with Jews for his pro-Israel stance post-October 7—runs as an independent on an explicit anti-antisemitism platform. Major Hasidic sects already endorsed him against Mamdani. Cuomo, despite his primary loss, may run independently—potentially splitting moderate votes. Internal polls suggest Adams holds only a slim lead over Mamdani if Cuomo withdraws. A three-way race (Adams, Mamdani, Cuomo) could propel the young socialist to Gracie Mansion via vote-splitting. Should Cuomo exit, a tighter Adams-Mamdani contest would emerge—with the shaken Jewish community potentially becoming kingmakers. Long road ahead Mamdani’s rise—from utter underdog months ago—featured viral campaign videos, a \"freeze the rent\" slogan and appearances with progressive icons Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders. He became an icon for housing and cost-of-living struggles: jumping into the Atlantic’s frigid waters in one video, breaking Ramadan fast with a subway burrito in another and walking Manhattan’s length for voter selfies days before the primary. But his path remains steep. A coalition of business interests, community institutions and vocal opponents will fight to prevent what many see as the \"beginning of the end.\" Follow Ynetnews on Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Telegram","summary":"Zohran Mamdani’s Democratic mayoral primary win - bringing him close to becoming the city's first Muslim mayor - sparks fear and division among New York’s Jews, testing whether the city remains a safe haven or is becoming hostile to its historic Jewish and Israeli diaspora community","url":"https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ryzvf29vlx","image":"https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/06/25/Hk19rMKEle/Hk19rMKEle_0_231_3000_1688_0_large.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-26 15:00:47","author":"Daniel Edelson, New York","authors":["Daniel Edelson, New York"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"il","sentiment":0.157},{"id":335511202,"title":"'Swiss army knife': Inside VP Vance's first 5 months in office as 'enforcer' of Trump's MAGA agenda","text":"Five months into Vice President JD Vance’s tenure inside the White House, Fox News Digital spoke to several of his colleagues about his specific role and accomplishments, including some that his peers say have been overlooked by most media outlets. Several in Vance’s political circle used words like \"Swiss army knife\" and \"utility player\" to describe a vice president, who they say flexibly steps into a variety of roles, including being a key voice on Capitol Hill guiding the president’s Cabinet nominees successfully through the Senate. \"He was very much involved in that, he made phone calls, he listened to people, he provided advice and thoughts and would talk things out with people,\" GOP Sen. Marsha Blackburn said, adding that Vance does not get enough credit for the \"level of engagement\" with his former colleagues in the Senate. Ohio GOP Sen. Bernie Moreno told Fox News Digital that Vance has been an \"enforcer\" in the Senate, not just when it came to confirming President Donald Trump’s Cabinet in a heated political climate, but also playing a significant role helping the president’s \"big, beautiful bill\" make its way through Congress. VANCE DEFENDS TRUMP'S IRAN POSITION AMID 'CRAZY STUFF ON SOCIAL MEDIA' \"If he [Trump] needs help with nominees, he is going to come over and do that, if he needs help with a Big Beautiful Bill, because obviously President Trump has got a lot on his plate, he'll come over to talk to his colleagues,\" Moreno said. \"If he has to lobby one on one, he’s built good relationships.\" Moreno, who ran against Vance for Senate in 2022 before dropping out and endorsing him and then running successfully in 2024 with Vance’s endorsement, went on to say that he has not heard \"one negative comment\" from Republicans in the Senate about Vance’s performance. \"In fact, one senator said to me today that their impression after the lunch yesterday was that he really started to look really presidential and how impressive he is,\" Moreno said. A senior White House official praised Vance’s \"direct impact\" in the Senate when it comes to legislative efforts and Cabinet confirmations, adding that Trump’s domestic agenda is where his \"impact has been felt the most.\" \"JD Vance throughout the whole transition, was always going to bat for Hegseth and for different nominees,\" the official said. \"So he played a very active role making sure all the various Cabinet officials got confirmed.\" VANCE, CONSERVATIVES BLAST OMAR OVER RESURFACED 'FEARFUL OF WHITE MEN' CLIP: 'GENOCIDAL LANGUAGE' Vance’s influence has been felt on the foreign policy front, as well as the vice president making high-profile trips to India, the Vatican and Germany outlining the president’s \"America First\" agenda. In India, Vance was involved with and touted progress made toward a U.S.-India trade deal, saying a partnership between the Trump administration and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi would ensure a 21st century that's \"prosperous and peaceful.\" Vance delivered a speech in Germany in February when he directly called out the organizers of the Munich conference, who he said had \"banned lawmakers representing populist parties on both the left and the right from participating in these conversations.\" The speech sparked a social media firestorm, drawing criticism from some and praise from others, including Fox News contributor Jonathan Turley, who described Vance’s remarks as a \"Churchillian\" moment for free speech. As the war between Russia and Ukraine raged on, Vance took an active role in the dialogue between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and was front and center in the viral White House blowup between the two leaders, calling out the Ukrainian leader for \"lack of respect.\" JD VANCE SCOLDS CBS FOR 'HARASSING' HIS MOTHER-IN-LAW OVER DEI DIFFERENCES 'IN ORDER TO ATTACK' TRUMP Vance, who has been labeled as an \"attack dog\" for Trump dating back to the campaign trail last year, gave several interviews outlining his belief that, at the time, Zelenskyy was impeding the peace process. Former Trump senior advisor Jason Miller told Fox News Digital that Vance has \"been influential when it comes to helping promote the president's foreign policy agenda.\" That influence was on full display in recent weeks as the United States bombed several nuclear sites in Iran, causing a stir with conservatives on social media on the merits of getting involved in a foreign conflict after Trump and Vance campaigned against drawn-out foreign wars of the past. \"Going into the conflict with Iran, I think was pretty notable for a couple of things. One, just the fact that the way he was elevated and was at the president's side for the entire time, really how he had a seat at the table as part of the decision-making and the driving force for what happened,\" Miller said. \"But then also, the fact that the vice president played such an important role of talking to people from across the MAGA coalition, people who are very much into America First and may have initially been skeptical with regard to Iran and being kind of the one of the main people in the admin who can kind of talk with both camps,\" he continued. \"And as we saw with his Twitter posts both before the action and then even afterwards being able to really articulate, lay out the rationale for what President Trump is doing and make sure that the people across the coalition have a clear understanding of it.\" Vance was front and center following the strike on Iran, sitting down for an interview with Fox News anchor Bret Baier on \"Special Report\" outlining the reasoning for the strike as news broke that a ceasefire had been negotiated with the countries involved. The White House official told Fox News Digital that when the president \"calls a play,\" Vance \"makes sure it's run\" even if the two may have a different perspective, which is a sentiment that Miller echoed, saying that Trump promotes a \"team environment\" to get perspective from all sides, even though he is ultimately the one who makes the final decision. \"I think that the president and the vice president are very much in lockstep when it comes to the ultimate goals that they're trying to accomplish,\" Miller said. VANCE’S ACTIVE VP ROLE IS A HISTORICAL RARITY, 'HUGE ASSET' TO US, SAYS TOP GOP ALLY In terms of the media’s portrayal of the relationship between Trump and Vance, Moreno told Fox News Digital that \"any story that says there's daylight between what Trump believes and what JD believes can be rejected out of hand, because it's not actually how it works.\" \"JD doesn't view himself as the person who's there to enact his agenda. He's there to enact President Trump's agenda.\" When it comes to Vance’s accomplishments on foreign and domestic policy in the first five months of the administration, both Miller and Moreno expressed the belief that the vice president has gotten more done in half a year than former Vice President Kamala Harris accomplished in four years. \"You're talking about literally polar opposites between her and JD,\" Moreno said. \"Even a mentally diminished Biden understood what a great liability Kamala Harris was, he basically froze her and put her in the basement. President Trump realizes, because he's a very smart guy, because he's the one that made the decision to pick JD Vance realizes that JD is very effective for him and isn't looking to overshadow or take the spotlight, but rather move his agenda forward.\" Miller agreed, saying that \"Vice President Vance is easily the best vice president and most notable Vice President we've had in the last 30 plus years and is light years of improvement over Kamala Harris.\" While speculation has run rampant about what the Republican Party will look like after Trump completes his second term and whether Vance is the heir apparent in a crowded Republican field, Miller told Fox News Digital that Vance is not focused on that but has been \"crushing it\" on the campaign trail raising money for the party. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"He's a huge draw out on the midterm fundraising trail and he's someone who many people view as the future of the movement,\" Miller said. Ultimately, Moreno told Fox News Digital that he does not think Vance gets enough credit for being one of the most \"grounded\" politicians he has encountered who genuinely cares for his friends and family and always keeps his humble beginnings in Middletown, Ohio, at the forefront of the decisions he makes. \"America First, and I said it when I nominated him in Wisconsin, it's not a political slogan, it's his North Star,\" Moreno said. \"It's why he is doing what he's doing. I don't think people realize that.

They tested it over and over again, tried different options, tried more after that,” Caine told reporters. “They accomplished hundreds of test shots and dropped many full-scale weapons against extremely realistic targets for a single purpose, kill this target at the time and place of our nation’s choosing. And then, on a day in June of 2025, more than 15 years after they started their life’s work, the phone rang and the president of the United States ordered the B-2 force that you supported to go strike and kill this target.”\n\n“Yesterday, I had honor and privilege of spending time with these two Defense Threat Reduction Agency officers who have given so much,” Caine continued. “One of them said, ‘I can’t even get my head around this, my heart is so filled with the pride of being a part of this team, I’m so honored to be a part of this. To you both, thank you and thank you to your families.”\n\nThe GBU-57 is a GPS-guided bomb weighing 27,125 pounds carrying 5,342 pounds of high explosive that can be carried on the B-2, according to Designation-Systems.net. Caine displayed a video of how the GBU-57 worked.\n\n“Let me talk about the graphic a little bit and the GBU-57, which all of you know is 30,000-pound weapon dropped only by the B-2. It is comprised of steel, explosive and a fuse programmed bespokely to achieve a particular effect inside the target. Each weapon had a unique desired impact angle, arrival, final heading and a fuse setting,” Caine said. “The fuse is effectively tells the bomb when to function. A longer delay in a fuse, the deeper the weapon will penetrate and drive into the target. So, on Fordow, in June of 2008, you can see these three holes depicted here as the main exhaust shaft with two additional ventilation shafts on either side. The United States decided to strike two ventilation shafts seen here on main graphic as primary point of entry into the mission space.”\n\n“In the days preceding the attack against Fordow, the Iranians attempted to cover the shafts with concrete to try to prevent an attack. I won’t share specific dimensions of the concrete cap, but you should know that we know what the dimensions of those concrete caps were,” Caine continued. “The planners had to account for this, they accounted for everything. The cap was forcibly removed by the first weapon and the main shaft was uncovered. Weapons two, three, four, five were tasked to enter the main shaft, move down into the complex at greater than 1,000 feet per second and explode in the mission space. Weapon number six was designed on each side so six on each side, weapons number six designed as a flex weapon to allow us to cover if one of the preceding jets or one of the preceding weapons did not work. The video I’m about to show you is a culmination of over 15 years of development and testing, as I said, hundreds of test shots on various models. This is one weapon, so if you take a view of this as five additional, you will get a sense of what this looks like.” (RELATED: Kamala Supporter Praises Trump’s Iran Bombing, Admits Harris Would’ve Lacked The ‘Courage’)\n\nIsrael launched a military operation targeting the Iranian nuclear program on June 12, after efforts to secure a cessation of Iran’s nuclear program through diplomacy failed, striking nuclear facilities and targeting the theocratic regime’s top nuclear scientists and military commanders.\n\n Gen. Dan “Razin” Caine demonstrates how GBU-57 MOPs work: “Unlike a normal surface bomb, you won’t see an impact crater because they’re designed to deeply bury and then function … All six weapons at each vent at Fordow went exactly where they were intended to go.” pic.twitter.com/iQs3oWcJ4X — Rapid Response 47 (@RapidResponse47) June 26, 2025 \n\n“Unlike a normal surface bomb, you won’t see an impact crater, because they are designed to deeply bury and then function. I know there has been a lot of questions about that. All six weapons at each vent at Fordow went exactly where they were intended to go. A bomb has three effects that causes damage: Blast, fragmentation and overpressure,” Caine said. “In this case, the primary kill mechanism in the mission space was mix of overpressure and blast ripping through the open tunnels and destroying critical hardware. The majority of the damage we assess based on our extensive modeling was a blast layer combined with impulse extending from the shock. Imagine what this looks like six times over.”\n\n“A point I want to make here, the joint force does not do BDA [bomb-damage assessment]. By design, we don’t grade our own homework, the intelligence community does,” Caine continued. “But here is what we know following the attack and the strikes on Fordow: First, that the weapons were built, tested and loaded properly. Two, the weapons were released on speed and on parameters. Three, the weapons all guided to intended targets and to their intended aimpoints. Four, weapons functioned as designed, meaning they exploded, we know this through other means, intelligence means we have that were visibly able to see them and we know that the trailing jets saw the first weapons function and pilots stated, quote, ‘This was the brightest explosion I’ve ever seen, it literally looked like daylight.’”\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

It’s regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, allowing it to function in states where sports betting is banned.\n\nKalshi skyrocketed to popularity this past year after its platform correctly predicted President Donald Trump would win over former vice president Kamala Harris — even when traditional polling had the two candidates neck-in-neck.\n\nMost recently, Kalshi’s website correctly predicted hours before polls closed that Zohran Mamdani, the New York City primary candidate, would beat former governor Andrew Cuomo for the Democratic nomination. \n\nIn its latest round of funding, Kalshi said it raised $185 million from investors, led by the venture capital firm Paradigm. Other investors included Peng Zhao, the CEO of Citadel Securities; Sequoia Capital, a venture capital firm; and Multicoin Capital, a crypto investment company, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nCalling it “one of the fastest growing companies in America,” Kalshi CEO and co-founder Tarek Mansour told CNBC that its growth cements its trajectory to becoming a leading financial market. \n\n“We always thought the mission of the company [is] the idea of building the most important financial market on the planet,” Mansour said. \n\nInvestments in Kalshi come less than a year after it won a lawsuit against the Commodity Futures Trading Commission that now allows it to list contracts on the outcome of elections — something that has historically been outlawed. \n\nMansour said it was their goal to create a financial market “that could price anything” from elections to Academy Award predictions to sports outcomes.\n\nKalshi and other betting markets have become a popular way for people to bet on the outcome of events, bypassing traditional gambling regulations. \n\nBut the method of so-called “backdoor gambling” has left lawmakers and regulators skeptical.\n\n\"These contracts are a backdoor attempt to bring gambling into financial markets,\" Cantrell Dumas, the director of derivatives policy at Better Markets, a non-profit group that advocates for a safer financial market system, told Reuters.\n\nThree former government officials raised alarm bells about betting markets in October, warning Americans not to get too comfortable with them, given that there is little historical accuracy or precedent.\n\nMansour acknowledged that Kalshi could serve as a powerful tool for the public to gauge the predictability of political events, but he said it should still not replace traditional polling.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez a top Democratic Party leader as he tore into the left over its embrace of extremism.\n\n“I’m not picking on AOC. I respect her success in developing a following. I just think she’s killing her party,” Cuomo said Tuesday as he discussed the Democratic Party’s shift to the left.\n\n“She is a deranged form of Democrat and I’m pointing her out because she’s at the top of the food chain.”\n\nA CNN poll earlier this year found that Ocasio-Cortez came out on top when Democrats were asked which leader best reflects the core values of the party.\n\nThere was no clear future leader for the Dems though, according to the poll, since Ocasio-Cortez only received a measly 10% share, trailed by former Democratic nominee Kamala Harris at 9%.\n\n“She ranked higher than Harris, [House Minority Leader Hakeem] Jeffries, [California Gov. Gavin] Newsom, even [former president Barack] Obama, are you kidding me?” an exasperated Cuomo said.\n\n“She couldn’t be less about what made the Democratic Party great and I get to say that. She is not a real one.”\n\nCuomo’s attacks on Ocasio-Cortez, whose district covers parts of Queens and the Bronx, came as he laid into the Democratic party for moving too far left and abandoning moderate voters.\n\nHe took illegal immigration as an example of a voting issue that “resonated with the many, not just MAGA.”\n\n“The majority is not afraid of migrants, as Trump may like, but they are afraid of these guys, Iranian nationals with jihadist sympathies,” Cuomo said.\n\n“You let them in with a laxity that AOC and other radicals insisted on, and the far left is actively embracing people who are the enemy. Pro Hamas? People who chant globalize the intifada, the Palestinian uprising characterized by over 130 suicide bombings, really?”\n\nOn Wednesday, Cuomo declared the Democratic Party “dead” after his brother, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, conceded in the mayoral primary election to Zohran Mamdani, a 33-year-old self-proclaimed socialist who wants to freeze rent prices.\n\n“The Democratic Party is now officially in MAGA mode. We are now, on both sides, in a period of extremism,” Cuomo said on his NewsNation show.\n\n“The same way MAGA played with the prejudices of white nationalism, you’re seeing an identical dynamic on the left with prejudices like tacitly supporting extreme Islamism or targeting Jews.”\n\nCuomo was fired from CNN in 2021 after a law firm found he aided his brother, then the governor, in defending himself against sexual harassment allegations.\n\nAndrew Cuomo resigned as governor that same year after an investigation overseen by New York’s attorney general concluded that 11 women were telling the truth when they accused him of sexual assault and harassment.","summary":"Chris Cuomo’s attacks on Rep.

The discussion explored Cameron\u0019s unexpected rise to fame, his spiritual transformation from atheism to born-again Christianity, his navigation of public controversies, his political engagement and vision for a spiritual revival through his new book, Born to Be Brave: How to Be Part of America\u0019s Spiritual Comeback. \n\nThe conversation began with a bit of nostalgia, as Stone highlighted the enduring excitement surrounding actors like Cameron, whose roles create lasting cultural connections. Cameron attributed this to the communal viewing experience of 1970s and 1980s television, when shows like Happy Days, Star Trek, and Little House on the Prairie were shared events, unlike today\u0019s on-demand streaming. He shared that his name, inspired by Captain Kirk from Star Trek, reflected his father\u0019s fandom, humorously noting an \u001curban legend\u001d that his sister narrowly escaped being named Spock. Discussing the slow, comforting pace of Little House on the Prairie, Cameron compared it to Mr. Rogers\u0019 Neighborhood, which fostered engagement by mimicking real-life conversations, countering the frenetic pace of modern media that can harm children\u0019s mental health. \n\nCameron\u0019s early life provided context for his later transformation. Dreaming of becoming a doctor, fascinated by science and biology, he stumbled into acting through his mother\u0019s initiative, landing commercials for Fruit Loops and McDonald\u0019s before starring in Growing Pains. As a 14- to 17-year-old, he grappled with fame\u0014autographs, public recognition\u0014while embodying Mike Seaver, a character mirroring his teenage mischief: sneaking out, chasing girls, and dodging trouble. A self-described atheist, Cameron began pondering philosophical questions about death and the afterlife, dismissing notions of an \u001cimaginary being.\u001d \u001cI was just a hormone with feet at 14 years old, sneaking out of the house, trying to get a date with the cutest girl,\u001d he quipped, capturing the carefree mindset that preceded his spiritual awakening.\n\nA pivotal moment came at 17, when Cameron, invited to church by a girl he liked, attended with ulterior motives but was captivated by a sermon that stirred his intellect and conscience. Reflecting alone in his sports car, he prayed for God to reveal Himself, marking the start of his journey to becoming a born-again Christian. \u001cIf today\u0019s the day that I get hit by a drunk driver and get catapulted to the gates of heaven, I\u0019m not getting in because I don\u0019t even believe in God,\u001d he recalled, underscoring the moment\u0019s gravity. \n\nThis was not a snap decision but a deliberate process, as he studied archaeology, history, prophecy, and psychology to ground his faith, wary of becoming a caricature of religiosity. His faith reshaped acting into a platform for hope, courage, and truth, and he urged Christians to engage in fields like entertainment to shape culture positively.\n\nOn Growing Pains, Cameron\u0019s push for family-friendly scripts sparked conflicts with producers and actors, who saw it as religious overreach. Reflecting on his youthful zeal, he admitted lacking grace and patience, a lesson that shaped his later approach. He advocated for faith to permeate all professions\u0014acting, shoemaking, or electrical work\u0014as an expression of gratitude to God. \n\nPublicly, Cameron initially shared his faith enthusiastically, likening it to discovering the Beatles, but was surprised by backlash from those who felt he claimed moral superiority. The most significant controversy arose during a 2016 Piers Morgan interview, where Cameron was pressed on homosexuality, abortion, and contraception, despite intending to promote a movie. He statements about homosexuality ignited a firestorm of criticism. He recalled Morgan sidestepping the agreed-upon movie discussion, pivoting to hot-button issues during commercial breaks, saying, \u001cYep, yep, we\u0019ll get around to that,\u001d only to continue pressing on topics like contraception and Obama\u0019s policies. Cameron felt ambushed, realizing the interview was driven by ratings rather than honest dialogue. \n\nThe next morning, he awoke to headlines accusing him of hate speech, a reaction that shocked him. Advised by Dr. Ben Carson to avoid reactive responses that could be taken out of context, Cameron learned to speak truth with humility, stating, \u001cMy job is to love people and do it with authenticity and try to speak the truth as I understand it.\u001d\n\nCameron\u0019s views have since evolved to prioritize positive engagement over cultural critique. When asked about his stance on homosexuality, he focused on Jesus\u0019 call to love enemies and treat others with patience, advocating for open dialogue without shutting down differences. He engages in public schools, libraries, and media to amplify truth and goodness, acknowledging his own imperfections. \u001cThe only thing that matters is faith expressing itself through love,\u001d he stated, encapsulating his commitment to loving others while holding firm to his beliefs. \n\nPolitically, Cameron\u0019s support for Donald Trump prompted questions about reconciling Trump\u0019s perceived lack of humility and kindness with Christian values. Cameron acknowledged Trump\u0019s abrasive style but valued his policies\u0019 alignment with constitutional principles over alternatives like Hillary Clinton or Kamala Harris. Frustrated by a system offering limited choices, he wished for a broader pool of exemplary candidates. Framing politics within God\u0019s sovereignty, he trusts God works through leaders for the good of believers, focusing his influence on personal interactions. \u001cMy trust ultimately is not in a political figure. It\u0019s in God\u0019s ability to run his world well,\u001d he affirmed, grounding his political perspective in faith.\n\nCameron\u0019s book, Born to Be Brave: How to Be Part of America\u0019s Spiritual Comeback, aims to spark a spiritual revival, drawing on historical Great Awakenings during moral decline and corruption. Seeing America as ripe for renewal, he hopes to witness it but defines success through faithfulness, not immediate results. \u001cDuty is ours. The results are up to God,\u001d he declared, emphasizing a legacy-driven approach. \u001cI plant a seed today that will grow into a tree whose shade I\u0019ll never enjoy, but I believe that my children will,\u001d Cameron concluded.\n\n Recommended\n\n \n\n \"Unknown\" Host Charlie Stone Interviews Sen.

However, fans still remember her and the legacy she left. She served in the White House alongside former President Joe Biden. Sadly, the remembrance did not come from moments of gratitude but from online trolls and threats.\n\nA federal grand jury has charged 37-year-old Steven Hartford of Shippensburg, Pennsylvania, with allegedly threatening to “assassinate” former Vice President and 2024 presidential candidate Kamala Harris via statements on TikTok.\n\nAccording to the Department of Justice, Hartford—using the handle “thealex13one13\"—commented on a July 21, 2024, Daily Mail TikTok video asking, “Will Kamala Harris be the next Democratic nominee?” His reply was, “I will assassinate her if she runs for president.” Can you imagine threatening a female political figure on social media? Yeah, the audacity of men these days seems to be utterly shameful!\n\nAs per The Atlanta Black Star, DOJ records also reveal additional threats in a follow-up Daily Mail post questioning whether Harris could succeed Joe Biden. Hartford allegedly wrote menacing messages like “22 250 coming her way,” “5.56 for her,” and “5.56 waiting for her.” Hartford has pleaded not guilty and is scheduled to stand trial starting August 25, 2025. If convicted of threatening a major presidential candidate, he faces up to 10 years in prison.\n\nIn a similar incident, in August 2024, 55-year-old Frank Lucio Carrillo from Virginia was arrested after allegedly posting over 4,300 threats targeting Harris, Joe Biden, and other officials on the right-wing platform Gettr. The Winchester resident reportedly threatened to set fire to the house where the vice president lives and to “personally pluck out her eyes,” according to a charging document.\n\nWhen the FBI resident reached Carillo’s house, they found two firearms from his home: a pistol he bought in 2023 and a rifle purchased in 2024. After witnessing a series of online hate and a bizarre set of crimes against political leaders, celebrities, and so on, United States Attorney Christopher R. Kavanaugh of the Western District of Virginia spoke to the media.\n\n“Open political discourse is a cornerstone of our American experience. We can disagree. We can argue and we can debate. However, when those disagreements cross the line to threats of violence, law enforcement must step in” (via UPI). Meanwhile, Prosecutors are seeking Hartford’s case under Operation Take Back America, a federal program aimed at cracking down on violent crime, drug trafficking, and immigration violations.\n\nConsequently, as of March 2025, Kamala Harris has not made any formal announcements on social media about her next political move and is seen as somewhat absent as an opposition amidst the recent political developments and tensions under the Trump administration in the country. She, however, keeps posting to mark important landmark days in America. Haters have mocked Kamala Harris for “not achieving anything” and taking time off for nothing in media interviews. (Check the clip below.) \n\nCBS News reported that Kamala Harris would allegedly run for governor of California in 2026. According to insiders, the 60-year-old self-made lady is seeking ways to remain involved in national conversations while keeping all political opportunities open. On February 22, Harris received the Chairman’s Award at the 56th NAACP Image Awards.\n\nShe was spotted in a black outfit, accepting the honor and addressing the public for the first time since she lost the elections. Without naming President Trump, she urged Americans to “organize, mobilize, educate, and advocate” and stressed staying united and fighting for justice and the people’s rights.\n\nIt’s truly sad to witness that the dark aspect of social media has normalized threatening, bullying, and shaming people at the convenience of a button to the extent that there’s no ounce of respect left for either older women or well-known figures. While mere backlash for one’s actions as a media personality is part and parcel of being in the spotlight, death threats and violence will always be totally unacceptable.","summary":"A Pennsylvania man was charged after threatening to assassinate Kamala Harris in a series of online comments on TikTok.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/i-will-assassinate-her-man-who-threatened-to-kill-kamala-harris-faces-10-years-in-prison","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Former-Vice-President-Kamala-Harris-.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-26 13:26:01","author":"Sweta Choudhury","authors":["Sweta Choudhury"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.002},{"id":335475858,"title":"Who are Taylor Swift's cats named after? Mariska Hargitay claims it's a \"payback\" as her cat is called Karma after the singer's hit track","text":"American actress and film producer Mariska Hargitay revealed how a Taylor Swift song inspired her cat’s name during her appearance on the June 25, 2025, episode of Alex Cooper’s Call Her Daddy podcast. During her conversation, the actress shared the backstory behind naming her cat Karma, explaining that it was a tribute to Swift’s 2022 hit song, Karma.In the episode, host Alex Cooper mentioned that Taylor Swift had named one of her cats after Olivia Benson, the iconic detective character Hargitay portrayed on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit. Hargitay, in response, said she did \"payback\" Taylor Swift in her own way:\"I will say, as epic as that is, I did name my cat Karma. Okay. So, payback’s a b**ch,\" she explained.Taylor Swift named her pets after iconic pop culture characters. In addition to Olivia Benson, Swift's second cat was named Meredith Grey, after Ellen Pompeo’s lead character in Grey’s Anatomy. Her third cat was named Benjamin Button, inspired by Brad Pitt’s character in the 2008 film The Curious Case of Benjamin Button.During the podcast, Hargitay explained that naming her pet \"Karma\" felt like a way to \"level the playing field\". Drawing from the chorus of Swift’s song, she added:\"Karma is a cat, and she and Karma vibe like that\".This line echoed Swift’s original lyrics of Karma that went:\"Karma is a cat / Purring in my lap ’cause it loves me / Flexing like a goddamn acrobat / Me and karma vibe like that\".Cooper, curious about the timeline, asked whether Hargitay chose the name “Karma” before or after the song was released. Hargitay admitted that the decision came shortly after the track’s debut. For her, it was “the only thing\" that \"seemed fair\", since Swift had already honored her by naming a cat after Olivia Benson.Interestingly, Hargitay revealed that she hadn’t even planned on getting a cat. The adoption happened spontaneously during a family outing. She recalled a trip to a pet store with her children and husband, actor Peter Hermann. Peter “vibed” with a particular kitten, and they “went home with a cat,” whom they named Karma.What else do we know about Taylor Swift’s cats?Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour - Singapore - Source: GettyAmerican singer and songwriter Taylor Swift isn’t just a global music superstar. Behind the scenes, Swift is a proud cat mom and over the years welcomed three feline companions, Meredith Grey, Olivia Benson, and Benjamin Button, into her home.Swift’s journey into cat parenthood began in 2011 when she brought home her first cat, a Scottish Fold she named Meredith Grey.\"She is awesome. She's, like, the most adorable cat in the world,\" the singer said after bringing her home ( as per People Magazine).Meredith also made several appearances on Swift's Instagram and is a bit of a star in her own right. In Deadpool 2, Meredith and Olivia were featured on a t-shirt worn by Ryan Reynolds’ character, labeled, \"Olivia & Meredith Best Friends Purrrrr-Ever\".Despite her fame, Meredith was a reclusive cat and preferred a quiet life. During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Swift encouraged her fans to self-quarantine and posted a photo of Meredith tucked away in a toy:\"For Meredith, self-quarantining is a way of life. Be like Meredith,\" she jokingly wrote.In 2021, fans became increasingly concerned about Meredith’s health after her absence from Taylor Swift's social media feed. However, Swift reassured fans via an Instagram video post that everything was fine with Meredith:\"We’ve been hearing some rumors on the internet recently…The truth is, Meredith just hates having her picture taken,\" she clarified.Taylor Swift brought her second cat, Olivia Benson, home in 2014. Olivia is another Scottish Fold.In 2015, Olivia even got the chance to meet her namesake. Swift shared a video of the white kitten cuddling up to Hargitay as she knelt to feed her.\"This is Olivia Benson meeting Olivia Benson, and um, things are going well so far,\" Taylor Swift said in a video ( as per People Magazine)Like Meredith, Olivia didn’t shy away from the limelight. Along with her sister, she appeared in Deadpool 2 and the ME! music video. She also had a viral moment in 2017 when Swift shared an outtake from an AT&T ad in which she adorably babbled to the cat while Olivia stared back blankly.Olivia even dabbled in advertising, co-starring with Swift in a Diet Coke commercial. Each time Swift took a sip, more cats appeared, all orbiting around Olivia.During the singer's preparation for the Reputation tour in 2018, Swift posted a photo of Olivia mid-stretch with the caption:\"We are all stretching to prep for that tour choreo\".In 2019, Olivia joined Swift and Benjamin Button at the Billboard Music Awards, sharing a backstage moment with Paula Abdul. Most recently, she was seen in October 2024 when Swift shared a video of herself holding Olivia while walking into Miami’s Hard Rock Stadium. “Taylor Swift welcomed her third cat, a Ragdoll named Benjamin Button, in 2019. The kitten’s arrival wasn’t planned, but the connection was instant. While filming the ME! music video, Swift met Benjamin, who was part of an adoption program that placed kittens in commercials to find them homes.In an Instagram Live video with Panic! at the Disco's Brendon Urie, Swift talked about how she found \"a cute kitten\", referring to Benjamin, who \"didn’t have a home\". She further recalled the moment the handler asked if she wanted to hold the kitten before the shoot.\"She handed me this tiny cat, and he just starts purring and … he looks at me like, ‘You’re my mom, and we’re going to live together.’ I fell in love... “I looked at Brendon and he’s like, ‘You’re going to get the cat, aren’t you?’\" Taylor Swift added.A few days later, Swift introduced Benjamin to the world on Instagram with a cute photo of the two of them.\"And then there were three,\" Taylor Swift captioned the post. View this post on Instagram Instagram PostBenjamin quickly made himself at home in Swift’s world and on her social media. In 2021, he starred in a TikTok video for the #ImFeeling22 trend, with Swift joking that Benjamin is \"22 in cat years\". In 2023, he joined Taylor Swift on the cover of TIME magazine in December 2023, lounging majestically on her shoulders.Benjamin also had a political moment in 2024 when Swift posted a photo from the TIME shoot to endorse Vice President Kamala Harris for president. In the caption, she praised Harris’ policies and cheekily signed off as a \"Childless Cat Lady\". This was a pointed reference to J.D. Vance’s comment that America was being run by \"childless cat ladies\".

The agony of women who are unable to delete their babies has been her cause.\n\nThat tilt surfaced as the article was being pieced together. Evita Duffy-Alfonso, the oldest daughter of Duffy and wife Rachel Campos-Duffy, tweeted: “One of the deranged questions she bombarded my parents with was if they considered aborting their first child—me.”\n\nKitchener’s overarching point in this article is how Sean Duffy has exploited his large family with nine children as a collection of props to help push his political career. This is a little funny since most politicians pose with their children in campaign ads.\n\n“The truth is simple: We’re not a prop, a brand, or some act. We’re a real, loving, faithful, joyful family,” tweeted Evita. She called Kitchener “bitter and a creep.”\n\nThis was not how The New York Times covered the last transportation secretary, Pete Buttigieg, who adopted twins in 2021 to the delight of liberal media outlets. No one wrote a front-page article about Buttigieg being a poseur. You could try to find a New York Times article on how Kamala Harris posed with her adult stepchildren in all the publicity about how she’s called “Momala.” Were they just props?\n\nAs RedState writer Stacey Matthews joked: “In the aftermath of the ‘MTV Reality Star in Trump’s Cabinet Who Wants You to Have More Kids’ article, we look forward to a future ‘Willie Brown’s Ex Mulls California Gubernatorial Run’ write-up on former Vice President Kamala Harris.”\n\nThe difference was that Harris was childless, which they were always poised to defend against “childless cat lady” taunts. Buttigieg adopted twins at middle age. That’s not making the big leap of having nine children. \n\nLeftists are creeped out about “natalism,” anyone promoting more births instead of more abortions.\n\nKitchener outlined the threat this way: “As the Trump administration seeks to both exude macho masculinity and encourage men to settle down, some conservatives see Mr. Duffy as an important cultural figure who offers a middle way. A red-blooded American male who once scored with reality-TV stars, he is now a devoted dad with his own chicken coop and beehives.” \n\nAre you scared yet?\n\nKitchener warned of Duffy’s “controversial memo” pledging to prioritize transportation funding for regions with higher birth rates and marriage rates, noting Democratic senators have called that “deeply frightening” and “disturbingly dystopian.”\n\nTo underline the natalist conspiracy, The Associated Press found the 14 states with the highest fertility rates backed Trump in the November election, while the bottom 11 plus the District of Columbia supported Harris.\n\nIt’s understandable that abortion-loving feminists feel threatened by any promotion of a pro-life culture of large Catholic families. “Be fruitful and multiply” sounds like God at His worst. It’s disturbing that this qualifies as their dystopia. In their utopia, abortion pills fly through the mail for liberated women to exercise their autonomy and choose death for their inconvenient babies. \n\nThey are killers, hear them roar.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2024 CREATORS.COM\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

This is what Democrats are asking after struggling with male voters in the 2024 presidential election. Fox News Digital got reactions from Americans near Atlanta about this and if they believe there's a real problem with the guys. Overall, most people interviewed found the plan to spend $20 million on studying American men laughable. \"I think it's dumb,\" said Patrice from Atlanta. Miriam, also from Atlanta, said, \"I think there's better places to put that money.\" \"I think they're just going to flush our money down the toilet,\" said Miguel from Colorado. On the study, Dave from Tennessee said, \"I would say they're not going to learn much.\" Aaron from Dallas, Georgia asked, \"What do they [Democrats] consider to be men?\" DEMOCRATIC PARTY SCRAMBLES TO FIX IMAGE AS MEMBERS ACKNOWLEDGE PARTY 'LOST CREDIBILITY' \"I don't know why you have to spend money to study men,\" said another. \"If they can figure out what a man is first, that'd be pretty sick, but I don't think that's gonna happen,\" said Ethan from Ringgold, Georgia. When asked if there is something wrong with American men, Evelyn from Tennessee said, \"I mean, there's things wrong with everyone.\" \"I think it's true that there's maybe some conversation to be opened up about what American men need and maybe some improvements that could be made for men and women as a whole,\" said Sarah from Woodstock, Georgia. Ethan said, \"about half of them yeah…\" and whispered, \"Democrats,\" into the microphone. Several struggled to answer who they believed was the manliest Democrat. \"I can't think of any to be honest,\" said Miguel. \"Oh, I don't know,\" said Evelyn from Tennessee. A few were able to provide examples. Patrice said, \"Barack Obama.\" GINGRICH WARNS 'VERY PROFOUND CULTURAL CIVIL WAR' UNDERWAY, SAYS DEMOCRATS DOUBLING DOWN ON 'WEIRD VALUES' Ethan said, \"Andrew Jackson.\" \"Speaking with American Men: A Strategic Plan\" is a $20 million project crafted by Democrats to \"study the syntax, language and content that gains attention and virality in these spaces\" of male voters, the Times reported in May. Known as \"SAM,\" the study will specifically examine young male voters and how the party can connect with the demographic. Additionally, the study advised rolling out pro-Democrat ads in video games. The study's revelation was made in an overarching article detailing the uphill battle Democrats face after the 2024 election, which included Democrats scrambling to replace former President Joe Biden as the nominee with just more than 100 days left in the election cycle and ultimately delivering all seven battleground states to President Donald Trump. Trump made big in-roads with the male vote during the 2024 election cycle. A Fox News Voter Survey published in November 2024 found that men aged 18–44 supported Trump at 53%, compared to former Vice President Kamala Harris’ 45%. While The Associated Press found that more than half of male voters under the age of 30 voted for Trump instead of Harris — including roughly six-in-10 White male voters supporting Trump — about one-third of Black male voters supported Trump, as did about 50% of young Latino male voters. Trump's support among young Black and Latino male voters jumped by about 20% compared to his 2020 support, the AP reported.

Wade overturned, but now being able to actually defund the organization that conducts a lot of these abortions,” LaBruna said.\n\nKelsey Pritchard, policy director for SBA Pro-Life America, told the Washington Examiner that “Dobbs made everything possible.”\n\n“From where we’ve gotten from 2022 to today, it was really the new beginning of the pro-life movement,” Pritchard said. \n\nNavigating the post-Dobbs minefield\n\nThe GOP expected a “red wave” in the 2022 midterm elections, but Republicans lost key races in the House and did not gain control of the Senate. Analysts blamed heightened abortion-rights turnout following Dobbs, but several anti-abortion Republican candidates were able to survive contentious state-level races.\n\nGovs. Ron DeSantis (R-FL), Kim Reynolds (R-IA), Mike DeWine (R-OH), and Brian Kemp (R-GA), all of whom passed six-week abortion restrictions that year, were reelected in 2022. \n\nBut these candidates were largely the exception, not the rule, in terms of running anti-abortion campaigns.\n\nNoah Brandt, vice president of communications for the anti-abortion group Live Action, told the Washington Examiner that Republicans were caught off guard by the Dobbs decision, which was leaked from the Supreme Court roughly six months before the November election. \n\n“I think Republicans reacted in a pretty flat-footed, inarticulate, and ineffective way,” Brandt said. “They acted pretty surprised. They didn’t know what was going on.” \n\nRepublicans distanced themselves from the anti-abortion movement during the 2024 election, in part due to the experience from 2022. The toughest blow came in July 2024 when Trump pushed Republicans to remove language from the GOP platform about life beginning at conception, much to the chagrin of social conservatives.\n\nBut Democrats, particularly once then-Vice President Kamala Harris took the helm from President Joe Biden, made abortion their central talking point. Pritchard said the 2024 result of a GOP trifecta should prove that the Democrats’ strategy was ineffective.\n\n“We saw Democrats go all-in on the issue of abortion. That was Kamala Harris’s top focus, and the American people didn’t buy what they were selling,” Pritchard said.\n\nSens. Dave McCormick (R-PA) and Bernie Moreno (R-OH) in 2024 were also able to unseat two long-term Senate Democrats who were staunch abortion-rights candidates.\n\nPritchard said the 2024 results should “embolden Republicans” to be more open and frank on abortion during the 2026 campaign season.\n\nGround game for 2026\n\nMarjorie Dannenfelser, president of SBA Pro-Life America, told reporters ahead of the third anniversary of Dobbs that her organization is already beginning its ground game operations in battleground states. \n\nShe said their focus is on House races, considering the narrow majority in the lower chamber, but they’ll also campaign in states with open Senate seats where an anti-abortion candidate can win. \n\nSBA is widely regarded as the most politically connected anti-abortion group in the broader movement. The organization spent nearly $2.3 million in lobbying during the 2024 campaign cycle and donated nearly $500,000 to Republican candidates, according to the campaign finance website OpenSecrets.\n\nDannenfelser told the Washington Examiner that most GOP candidates are confident they can succeed if Democrats make the 2026 election about abortion access yet again. \n\n“I actually think that there are a lot of Republicans who are thinking, ‘All right, go ahead, make my day. Make abortion again the No. 1 issue. We’ll see how it goes this time,” Dannenfelser said. \n\nLaBruna told the Washington Examiner that Republicans have been struggling for a long time “to figure out the way to message” on abortion but that they’re finally in a position to go on the offensive following Trump’s appointment of anti-abortion judges to the federal bench.\n\n“We wouldn’t be in this situation without President Trump, what he did with the Supreme Court and what he did with the other 200 judges, we would not be having this conversation right now with Roe v. Wade being overturned,” LaBruna said.\n\nDefunding Planned Parenthood and its election impacts\n\nLike overturning Roe, prohibiting Medicaid and certain Obamacare subsidies from being given to clinics that provide abortions has been seen as a proverbial white whale of the anti-abortion movement for decades, under the rallying cry of defunding Planned Parenthood. \n\nPlanned Parenthood’s 2023-2024 report indicates that the organization received more than $792 million from government reimbursements and grants, roughly 44% of its operating budget for 2023. During that time, the organization performed more than 402,000 abortions nationwide. \n\nAlthough the Hyde Amendment prevents federal dollars from directly reimbursing abortion services, anti-abortion advocates argue that any federal dollars sent to a clinic that provides abortion subsidize the practice due to the fungibility of money.\n\nPlanned Parenthood’s president has said that the loss of federal government funding would result in more than 200 Planned Parenthood closures across the country. \n\nCongressional Republicans and the White House have downplayed the importance of defunding Planned Parenthood with the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, but Democrats are poised to make it a central feature of their midterm campaigns should it be signed into law next month.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), during a press conference earlier this month, evoked the language used during the 2024 campaign season to denounce the reconciliation bill, saying that Republicans are trying to sneak in a “back-door abortion ban.”\n\nAnti-abortion advocates are hopeful that the effort to defund Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers baked into the GOP reconciliation bill will not have the same electoral blowback that the Dobbs decision did for the midterm elections.\n\nPublic opinion polling since 2014 has shown that voters do not support using taxpayer dollars, particularly Medicaid, to fund abortion.\n\nEven still, Brandt from Live Action said he thinks that Republicans are “better equipped” to handle rhetoric from abortion-rights opponents than they were during the immediate aftermath of Dobbs three years ago.\n\n“A big reason is they’re the ones voting for it. It’s not just happening to them from the Supreme Court. They’re doing it. They theoretically know what they’re voting on,” Brandt said.","summary":"Three years after the Supreme Court decided Dobbs v.

Celebrations broke out in the streets, and courthouses were flooded with newlyweds. But that wasn't the only response. Opponents of LGBTQ+ rights immediately began implementing new strategies to limit the decision's reach and reverse the broader momentum toward LGBTQ+ acceptance, including by casting a small, less understood subset of the queer community — transgender people — as a growing threat to American families and values. \"Right after Obergefell, every effort to advance any equality measure was met with an anti-trans backlash,\" said Chase Strangio, a transgender attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union and one of the nation's leading voices on LGBTQ+ legal rights. In statehouses and governors' mansions across the country, the number of bills targeting LGBTQ+ rights have increased year after year, with 800 being introduced this year alone. The Trump administration also has embraced the shift, with federal agencies aggressively investigating California and threatening its funding over its trans-inclusive policies. Last week, the Supreme Court ruled that states may ban gender-affirming care for transgender minors. The strategy has delighted many conservatives. But it has also frightened a community that had seen itself as being on a path toward progress, reviving discussions about the legacy of the Obergefell decision and igniting a fierce debate within the community about the wisdom of its political strategy over the past decade. Some have questioned whether the efforts since Obergefell to broaden transgender rights were pursued too fast, too soon, playing into the hands of the movement’s political foes. Others say those concerns sound strikingly similar to ones raised during the fight for marriage equality, when some argued that same-sex couples should settle for civil unions to avoid alienating religious moderates. The conversation is not a comfortable one. Nerves are raw and fear is palpable. Some worry that pointing the finger will further embolden those working to dismantle LGBTQ+ rights. But others argue that a strategic reassessment is necessary after years of setbacks. \"This can be an inflection point for how we move forward — whether we galvanize resources in [an] aligned effort to push back, [or] continue to let ourselves be divided by campaigns and movements and strategies that seek to divide us,\" Strangio said. \"That's the real question for this moment.\" Strangio, now co-director of the ACLU’s LGBT & HIV Project, had worked on the Obergefell case and was outside the Supreme Court the day the decision came down. He thought about his younger self, and how impossible such a ruling would have seemed just years before — when state marriage bans were sweeping the country. But he didn't have much time to dwell on the victory, he said, as it became clear \"within minutes\" that anti-LGBTQ+ forces were already regrouping and preparing for the next fight. One of their first targets was transgender people's use of public bathrooms. Within months of the Obergefell decision, voters in Houston rejected an anti-discrimination measure after opponents falsely claimed that the ordinance's gender-identity protections would allow sexual predators to enter women's bathrooms. In 2016, North Carolina passed the nation's first law barring transgender people from using bathrooms aligned with their identities. The measure sparked huge backlash and statewide boycotts, led in part by corporate America — and the bill was rolled back in 2017. LGBTQ+ activists were jubilant, viewing North Carolina's embarrassment as a clear sign that history was on their side and that expanded transgender rights and protections were inevitable. And there would be big wins to come — including the 2020 Supreme Court ruling that the historic Civil Rights Act of 1964 protects LGBTQ+ employees from workplace discrimination nationwide. However, the tide was already beginning to shift, including as right-wing groups began to identify specific transgender issues that resonated with voters more than bathrooms, and as Trump — in his first term — began taking aim at transgender rights. Terry Schilling, president of the American Principles Project, said his organization \"poll tested all of these issues, the bathrooms, the showers, the locker rooms,\" and found that many were \"incredibly unpopular to voters\" — but some more than others. One of the issues that resonated the most, Schilling said, was kids' healthcare and competition in girls sports. So his group ran with that, including in the 2019 race for governor in Kentucky, when it ran an ad suggesting the Democratic candidate and ultimate victor — Andy Beshear — supported boys competing in girls' wrestling competitions, when in fact Beshear supported policies barring discrimination based on kids' gender identity. Schilling said it was \"the left's insistence that we need to start trans'ing kids\" that made the issue a political one. But his group's strategy in Kentucky helped wake conservatives up to the political value of highlighting it. \"We're really just tapping into a real vulnerability that Democrats started for themselves,\" Schilling said. Trump had pursued various anti-transgender policies during his first term, including a ban on transgender service members. But during his campaign for reelection, he centered transgender issues like never before, dumping millions of dollars into anti-transgender ads that cast his opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, as an extreme progressive on such issues. \"Kamala is for they/them; President Trump is for you,\" one ad said. Once in office, Trump moved even more aggressively against transgender rights than the community had feared — prompting various lawsuits from LGBTQ+ organizations that are still pending. He issued an executive order declaring there are only two genders, and suggesting transgender people don't actually exist. He again banned transgender people from serving in the military. He threatened the funding of states such as California with trans-inclusive school policies. He ordered transgender athletes out of youth sports. He said federal law enforcement would target those who provide gender-affirming care to minors. And his administration said it would stop providing transgender people with passports reflecting their identities. Harrison Fields, a White House spokesman, said the American people \"voted for a return to common sense,\" and Trump was \"delivering on every campaign promise.\" \"President Trump's historic reelection and the overall MAGA movement is a big tent welcome for all and home to a large swath of the American people,\" Fields said. Reggie Greer, who served as a senior advisor on LGBTQI+ Persons at the State Department in the Biden administration, remembers being in North Carolina during the 2016 bathroom bill fight. While local Democrats were pleased with how it had backfired on Republicans, it was clear to him that \"hate is lucrative,\" Greer said — with the anti-rights groups raising hundreds of millions of dollars. He now sees the episode as an early warning of what was to come. Nick Hutchins handled public affairs around the Obergefell case before joining the Human Rights Campaign, where he worked on state affairs and communications. Traveling through conservative states, he watched as more Republicans began seizing on LGBTQ+ issues after Trump’s 2016 victory. \"It was a moment when Republicans saw an opening and wanted to chip away at LGBTQ rights in any way they could,\" Hutchins said. \"That’s where you began to see a spaghetti-against-the-wall approach from their end, pursuing the bathroom bills that evolved into various education-focused bills, and healthcare.\" Inside the HRC during Trump’s first term, leadership felt confident that public opinion remained on their side. LGBTQ+ rights organizations had secured victories in statehouses on bathroom and healthcare issues, and were buoyed by Trump's electoral defeat in 2020. Yet, several warning signs emerged. Internal state polling by the HRC found large majorities of Americans supported trans rights, but a plurality opposed allowing transgender athletes to compete in sports. One former HRC staffer, granted anonymity to speak candidly, said the organization had not paid much attention to the issue until a series of political attacks in conservative states. The governor’s race in Kentucky was one, followed by a statehouse push in Louisiana. Still, other battles — including \"confronting whiteness in the movement\" — took precedent, the former staffer recalled. \"There were significant generational divides within the organization between the older teams and their younger staff that were more diverse on these issues,\" the staffer said. \"It was a distraction.\" Hutchins said LGBTQ+ organizations today are having \"autopsy conversations\" to take stock of how things have played out in recent years and identify lessons to be learned. Among the most prominent leaders of the modern LGBTQ+ movement, there is consensus on many things. It's a scary time for LGBTQ+ people and other vulnerable groups, including immigrants and women. Trump represents an existential threat to American democracy. The LGBTQ+ rights movement needs more resources to continue fighting back. Nobody is going to throw transgender people under the bus just because some Democrats have suggested it would help them rebound politically. \"No one person, no one community, is expendable. End of story,\" said Jim Obergefell, the lead plaintiff in the marriage case. The actor Laverne Cox, one of the most recognizable transgender women in the country, said the marriage victory in 2015 left the right in need of \"a new boogeyman,\" and they picked transgender people — a tiny portion of the U.S. population, at around 1%. They further picked on transgender people in sports — an even tinier group — in order to focus the conversation on \"hormones and physical ability,\" which is \"a great way to objectify trans people, to reduce us to our bodies, and thus dehumanize us,\" Cox said. The best way to fight back, she said, is to refocus the conversation on transgender people's humanity by allowing them to tell their own stories — rather than allowing their narratives to be \"hijacked by propaganda.\" \"We're just like everybody else in terms of what we want, need, desire, our hopes and fears,\" she said. \"Living authentically and being able to be oneself is where the focus should be.\" Evan Wolfson, an attorney and founder of the advocacy group Freedom to Marry, which is widely credited with securing the 2015 victory in the Obergefell case, said there are \"three significant factors\" that got the country to where it is today on transgender issues. The \"most important factor by far,\" he said, \"is the right-wing attack machine and the political agenda of some who are trying to attack and scapegoat and divide\" the country around transgender issues. A second factor, he said, is that transgender identities are still a \"relatively new\" concept for many Americans, and \"that conversation is just not as far along as the very long conversation about who gay people are.\" A third and far less significant factor, he said, are the \"missteps\" by LGBTQ+ advocates in the last decade, including some vocally renouncing anyone who is not 100% supportive of trans rights. \"We worked hard in the Freedom to Marry campaign to bring people along and to distinguish between those who were our true opponents, those who were really anti-gay, anti-rights, anti-inclusion on the one hand, and those who I called the 'reachable but not yet reached' — people who weren't with us, but weren't our true opponents, people who were still wrestling with the question,\" Wolfson said. Allowing people a bit more time and space to be brought along on transgender issues will be necessary moving forward, he said — though he stressed that does not mean that advocates should slow down or pull back. Wolfson rejected the idea that the LGBTQ+ community is moving too fast on transgender rights, which was also argued about marriage, and the idea that transgender rights should be abandoned as a political liability. \"There is no reason to believe that we would profit from selling out our principles and doing the wrong thing just to avoid this tough moment,\" Wolfson said. Strangio said the fight for LGBTQ+ rights today cannot be viewed in a vacuum, and that zooming out, \"there are a lot of reasons to be concerned about basic constitutional principles and civil rights protections\" for all sorts of vulnerable people under the Trump administration. Still, he said, he believes in the queer community's \"ability to move through setbacks\" and come out on ahead of the \"billion-dollar global campaigns to undermine equality protections\" that began after the Obergefell decision. \"Fighting back was the right course,\" he said, \"and continuing to assess how we can effectively build support for the entire community is going to be a critical part of this next decade.\"","summary":"Understanding how the U.S. went from marriage equality a decade ago to steep backsliding on transgender rights today could help determine what happens next for the country's LGBTQ+ rights movement.","url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2025-06-26/how-winning-same-sex-marriage-a-decade-ago-teed-up-todays-battle-over-transgender-rights","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2bfa677/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1575+0+213/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F71%2F34%2F54e289a341b8bc4f0b5153011fe0%2Fobergefell-trans-dis","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-26 10:00:00","author":"Kevin Rector,Michael Wilner","authors":["Kevin Rector","Michael Wilner"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.204},{"id":335386336,"title":"STEVE HILTON: Gavin Newsom's $9 gas nightmare looms over the Golden State","text":"California drivers are about to get hit – again – at the pump. On July 1, gas prices are set to rise thanks to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s relentless climate crusade when higher gas tax and stricter fuel regulations take effect, punishing working families under the guise of environmental virtue. Despite our state's plentiful oil reserves, Californians are forced by Democrat 'climate' policies to pay the nation’s highest gas prices (now around $5.00 per gallon), surpassing even Hawaii, in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Extortionate gas prices are not just an inconvenience; they are a crushing burden for working families, who typically face far longer commutes than the leftist work-from home elites who impose these policies. And they're a disaster for small businesses operating on tight margins and are already struggling under the weight of the nation's highest taxes and most burdensome regulations. For those who may think it can't get any worse, pay attention. A recent University of Southern California study predicts that gas prices in California could reach $6 by the end of this year and $8.40 next year, purely through a reduction in California's refining capacity thanks to the onslaught of 'climate' regulation. Add to that a planned 65-cent increase imposed by CARB (the out-of-control California Air Resources Board), and it's not fanciful to imagine the Democrats' extremist 'climate agenda' driving California toward an unthinkable $9 per gallon by 2026. This is ideological zealotry as economic sabotage. 35 DEMOCRATS VOTE WITH GOP TO BLOCK BIDEN RULE ALLOWING NEWSOM'S GAS CAR BAN California’s sky-high gas prices are the direct result of 15 years of one-party Democratic rule. Gavin Newsom, former Vice President Kamala Harris and every other leading Democrat in the state have been cheerleaders for this \"war on fossil fuels,\" endlessly bragging about \"leading the world\" on climate change. But their sanctimonious and narcissistic virtue-signaling comes at the price of real pain for the very people Democrats once claimed to represent: the working class. No wonder working class voters, in particular Latinos, are deserting the party in droves. The more you look at the crisis of affordability in California -- the highest costs in America not just for gas but for housing, electricity and every other necessity - the more you realize that the entire regulatory edifice of the Democrat 'climate agenda' is to blame. It is a bureaucratic monstrosity of tax and red tape, built up over the past 20 years since the passage of the 'Global Warming Solutions Act' in 2006, in the name of driving towards an absurd, fantastical target of \"net zero\" carbon emissions by 2045. It is an incoherent and unachievable pipe dream, the pursuit of which hurts the poorest and most vulnerable, bankrupting our state and driving jobs away faster than you can say \"Democrat luxury beliefs.\" $8.40 GAS? NEW STUDY REVEALS IT MAY COME TO A BLUE STATE NEXT YEAR, TRIGGERING BIPARTISAN CONCERN The immediate gas price shock has been prompted by a Democrat-created refinery crisis. California has no oil pipeline connection to the rest of the country, and on top of that it requires a special 'blend' of fuel. This and other regulations are prompting refiners to leave the state, starting with Phillips 66 in L.A. and followed in swift succession by Valero’s Benicia plant (recently crippled by fire), and the threatened closure of PBF’s Torrance facility. Over 25% of our refining capacity could vanish in a year, leaving us at the mercy of foreign oil and skyrocketing prices. Add to that the California Air Resources Board’s (CARB) insane rules, which could slap an extra 65 cents per gallon on fuel costs, and you’ve got a recipe for $9 gas. On top of this, complex micro-managing regulations—like the Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) and cap-and-trade fees—pile on costs that hit you at the pump. None of it is justified, even on environmental grounds. Refinery regulations and special fuel blends which may have once made sense in the era of smog and gas-guzzlers are utterly pointless in a world of increasingly fuel-efficient, modern cars. MEDIA PERSONALITY STEVE HILTON ENTERS CALIFORNIA GUBERNATORIAL RACE It doesn't have to be like this. We can protect our environment without crushing working families and small businesses. As governor, I would take immediate action to lower gas prices, with a simple, achievable target of $3 gas -- in line with what we see in the rest of the country. Here’s how we do it: First, we eliminate the ridiculous \"environmental program\" costs that add about 54 cents per gallon. These cap-and-trade fees are nothing but a tax on working people to fund Democrats' 'climate' schemes that have not even succeeded in reducing California's overall dependence on fossil fuels. CALIFORNIA'S 'AMBITIOUS' POLICIES TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GASES DRIVE SURGE IN ELECTRICITY COSTS: REPORT Second, we suspend the Low Carbon Fuel Standard, reformulation requirements, and other burdensome refinery regulations. These add roughly 40 cents per gallon in compliance costs, forcing refineries to jack up prices or shut down entirely. Third, we reduce the state’s obscene 60-cents-per-gallon excise tax. Why are Californians paying more to drive than anyone else in the country? Because Democrats are addicted to raising taxes. The trouble is, we get the nation's worst outcomes in return. Finally, we should take immediate steps to boost California’s oil production and suspend enforcement of Newsom’s pet legislative projects, SBX1-2 and ABX2-1, which choke our energy industry by slapping penalties on refineries for making \"too much\" profit and making rules like requiring extra fuel stockpiles to guard against the negative effect of the Democrats' own policies. These reforms could shave off another 25 cents per gallon. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Three-dollar gas is within reach. That would make a huge difference to so many working-class Californians and small businesses. It’s not complicated. It’s just positive, pragmatic policymaking. It's what happens when you stop letting ideologues and 'climate' zealots run the show. Newsom, Harris and the rest of the California Democrats want you to believe their green crusade is noble, but it’s a cruel hoax. They’re chasing refineries out of California, shutting down our cleaner in-state oil production, and piling on regulations that make life unaffordable. Meanwhile, they jet around in private planes and travel in motorcades—hypocrisy at its finest. Their policies don’t just hurt your wallet; they’re killing jobs, strangling small businesses, and making it impossible for families to make ends meet. And for what? So they can pat themselves on the back at climate conferences while you’re choosing between gas and groceries. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP I’m running for governor to end this madness. California has plentiful oil reserves—more than enough to keep prices low and our economy humming. But Newsom and Harris would rather bow to their woke base than admit fossil fuels are still essential. Their vision for California is one where only the elite can afford to live, while the rest of us are stuck paying $9 a gallon to get to work. It’s pathetic, it’s unfair, and it’s got to stop. With my plan, we’ll restore common sense, bring back affordability, and put Californians back in the driver’s seat—literally and figuratively. Three-dollar gas is possible, but only if we kick out the career politicians who’ve been fleecing us for years. Republican Steve Hilton is a candidate for governor of California.

Hodges was decided on June 26, 2015, in a 5 to 4 ruling. Justices John Roberts, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, who still sit on the nation's top court, wrote dissenting opinions along with their former colleague, the late Justice Antonin Scalia.While Gallup polling in 2015 showed that just 37 percent of Republicans thought same-sex marriages should be valid, that number rose to a record high of 55 percent in 2022 and 2023, but has since dropped to 41 percent as of May—a double-digit decline. Over the past few months, conservative lawmakers in at least nine states have introduced legislation aimed at undermining same-sex marriage. Some of these bills specifically take aim at the Supreme Court, urging the justices to overturn the Obergefell precedent.\"As an interracial gay couple with an adopted daughter, these developments are deeply unsettling—especially living in a swing state that leans conservative,\" Nikhil Patil, who resides in Georgia and married his husband in 2020, told Newsweek. \"My husband and I have had difficult conversations about contingency plans.\"Jeremy Hanson-McIntyre, who resides in Michigan and married his husband Joe in 2024, shared similar sentiments with Newsweek, saying that the legality of his marriage feels \"very unstable, precarious and unsafe.\" He particularly blamed President Donald Trump and the Christian nationalist movement he's aligned with.\"The current sitting president has built his campaign, image and reputation around the hatred and anger from the viewpoint of the Christian nationalists who utilize their hate-filled Bible thumping as a means to silence freedoms and prevent mere humans from simply living their own lives,\" he said.Newsweek reached out to the White House for comment.Is Same-Sex Marriage Under Threat?On June 10, the Southern Baptist Convention—the nation's largest Protestant denomination—called at its national meet for the \"overturning of laws and court rulings, including Obergefell v. Hodges, that defy God's design for marriage and family.\"Justice Clarence Thomas took aim at Obergefell in a 2022 concurring opinion when the Supreme Court overturned the landmark Roe v. Wade precedent, which had allowed abortion nationwide for nearly 50 years. In his opinion, Thomas said the court should also \"correct the error\" set by the precedent of Obergefell, as well as Lawrence v. Texas, which established that criminal penalties for sodomy or private sexual acts between consenting adults are unconstitutional.The opinion raised alarm bells for many LGBTQ+ individuals, especially as Thomas' opinion came with the Supreme Court's overturning of a long-established right to abortion. In response, Congress passed the bipartisan Respect for Marriage Act later that year, which shored up protections for same-sex marriage.While Obergefell could still technically be overturned, and conservative states could then outlaw issuing same-sex marriage licenses, the bipartisan legislation requires states to recognize all marriages performed in other domestic or foreign jurisdictions. In the House, 39 Republicans voted \"Yea,\" as did 12 GOP senators—meaning a significant majority of the GOP lawmakers voted against the bill in both chambers.Jim Obergefell, lead plaintiff in the 2015 case, recently shared his concerns. \"Yes, I'm worried about marriage equality,\" he told USA Today. \"If Obergefell is overturned, we go back to a time or a place where a queer couple in Ohio, where I live, might want to get married, but Ohio could refuse to issue a marriage license because Ohio still has a state level Defense of Marriage Act on the books.\" He added: \"Our biggest challenge is making sure we don't lose the progress we have made.\"At the local level, conservative lawmakers in Idaho, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee and Texas have introduced measures aimed at undermining same-sex marriage in recent months. While none of these have been successfully passed through a state legislature, the effort is notable, particularly as many directly urge the Supreme Court to overturn Obergefell.\"It is an important state sovereignty issue and one that should be debated at the state level, not at the U.S. Supreme Court level. The decision has already infringed on citizens' religious freedoms,\" Idaho state Representative Heather Scott, a Republican who introduced a measure urging the Supreme Court to overturn the precedent, told Newsweek.Daniel Innis, chairman of the LGBT group Log Cabin Republicans and a GOP state senator in New Hampshire, dismissed the effort playing out in some state legislatures. \"That's not how stuff works, particularly the Supreme Court. I find the whole thing quite amusing, honestly,\" he told Newsweek.Innis said \"there are people who occasionally play to the sort of fringe,\" adding the problem exists on the \"left and the right.\"\"Over the last decade, the presence of gay and lesbian folks in the Republican Party has become much more visible. It's totally like coming out of the closet a second time, when you're gay and come out as a Republican,\" he said.MassResistance, an anti-LGBTQ+ group that promotes socially conservative positions, has been the key driver behind many of the efforts in state legislatures to target same-sex marriage. The organization declined an interview request for this article.\"We are certainly flattered that Newsweek would want to interview us. However, given your personal situation regarding this issue, we can't believe there's any way you could be objective or fair. So we'll pass on this,\" the organization said. The rejection appeared to refer to the fact that this writer identifies as queer.Sarah Kate Ellis, president and CEO of the LGBTQ+ advocacy group GLAAD, said that \"threats to marriage equality are coming from a small fringe of extremists.\" She said that these individuals \"refuse to accept the reality that they have lost this battle for acceptance and our country is better off for it.\"Trump and Same-Sex MarriageDuring his 2016 presidential campaign, Trump briefly waved a rainbow flag with the words \"LGBTs for Trump\" during a Colorado rally. Groups like \"Gays for Trump\" and Log Cabin Republicans rallied behind him in that campaign, and in June 2016, Trump posted to Twitter, now X: \"Thank you to the LGBT community! I will fight for you....\"After taking office, he appointed Richard Grenell, who is openly gay and in a same-sex relationship, as his ambassador to Germany. In 2020 Grenell was named by Trump as acting director of national intelligence, making him the first openly gay person to serve in a Cabinet-level position, although he was never confirmed by the Senate.Ahead of the 2024 Republican National Convention, Trump quietly, and successfully, pushed the RNC to remove its definition of marriage as \"between one man and one woman.\" The updated platform instead promises that the GOP will \"promote a Culture that values the Sanctity of Marriage, the blessings of childhood, the foundational role of families, and supports working parents.\"In his second term, Trump appointed Scott Bessent, who is in a same-sex marriage, as treasury secretary. Bessent's appointment made him only the second-ever openly gay individual to be Senate-confirmed to a Cabinet role, the first being former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg under former President Joe Biden. It also made him the highest-ranking LGBTQ+ person in U.S. history, as he is currently 5th in line to the president.\"Trump has done this quietly,\" Innis said, criticizing the previous Democratic administration for focusing on \"identity politics.\" He said Bessent is a \"perfect example.\"\"This is a competent professional who knows his business, and he's not walking around carrying the gay flag,\" the Log Cabin chair said.Despite Trump's actions, post-2024 election polling by the LGBTQ+ advocacy group Human Rights Campaign (HRC) showed 84 percent of the community backed former Vice President Kamala Harris, while just 14 percent supported Trump. Preelection polling by GLAAD showed that only 15 percent of LGBTQ+ respondents preferred Trump over the Democratic ticket.Trump and the Transgender CommunitySome of the LGBTQ+ opposition to Trump may derive partly from his administration's stance on transgender issues. Solidarity is important to many LGBTQ+ individuals, and some see strong parallels between the anti-trans movement and the efforts to prevent same-sex couples from marrying prior to Obergefell.During his 2024 campaign, the president routinely railed against transgender athletes and raised concerns about \"gender ideology\" in schools. He even floated the claim that gender transition surgeries were being conducted during the school day.\"No transgender, no operations. You know, they take your kid...there are some places, your boy leaves for school, comes back a girl. OK? Without parental consent,\" he said last October. The claim lacks evidence, and professional medical organizations recommend that any gender-affirming surgery is performed after an individual turns 18.On his first day back in office, Trump signed an executive order targeting the transgender community. The order said the U.S. would \"recognize two sexes, male and female,\" stating that \"these sexes are not changeable and are grounded in fundamental and incontrovertible reality.\" His administration has gone on to target transgender athletes, and transgender individuals applying for new passports have received documents that list their sex assigned at birth, disregarding how they identify today.Innis said he doesn't see the Trump administration's effort as being \"anti-trans.\" He said it is \"a sentiment of protecting girls in sports and, you know, all sorts of other issues.\"\"I think we've got to be reasonable and say, you have every right to exist. You have every right to pursue what you perceive to be the best solution for you, but that doesn't mean you could trample on the rights of others. And I think that's what the president is trying to get at,\" he said.Last December, Charlie Baker, president of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), told a Senate panel that there were fewer than 10 transgender athletes—out of more than 500,000 total athletes—competing in the association. It's unclear how many there are nationwide in local high schools and middle schools, but most researchers believe the number to be vanishingly small.The Future of Same-Sex MarriageWhile Gallup's polling has shown a dip in GOP support for same-sex marriage over the past couple of years, Americans overall approve by a large margin. As of May, the polling organization's data showed 68 percent of Americans believe same-sex marriages should be valid, while less than half that number, 29 percent, said they should not be.\"When people see our families and recognize that we share the same values and challenges as any other family, support for our basic rights rises,\" GLAAD's Ellis said.Additionally, a growing number of young Americans identify as LGBTQ+. More than one in five, 22 percent, of those aged 18 to 29 say they are part of the community, according to survey results from the Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI). That's more than double the 10 percent of the 30- to 49-year-olds who identify the same way.But even as demographics change and gay Republicans become more visible, the conservative pushback to the LGBTQ+ community raises concern for many.\"It's a strange dichotomy—we have more gay representation in media and pop culture than ever before, yet we're seeing a surge in anti-LGBTQIA+ sentiment at the political level,\" Patil said.Hanson-McIntyre said that the Trump administration has \"made active moves against the LGBTQ+ community\" and \"has fostered an environment and atmosphere...that emboldens those with prejudices, biases and uneducated fears against the LGBTQ+ community.\"At the same time, Hanson-McIntyre said he's seen how some within the Republican Party have changed their perspectives. \"Those who have become more accepting are out there and do exist. The problem is, it's the irrational far-right agenda which screams the loudest and the ugliest,\" he said.","summary":"\"As an interracial gay couple with an adopted daughter, these developments are deeply unsettling,\" Nikhil Patil told Newsweek.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/2025/07/04/ten-years-after-landmark-supreme-court-ruling-same-sex-marriage-risk-2088309.html","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2667611/per02-obergefell.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-26 09:00:01","author":"Jason Lemon","authors":["Jason Lemon"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.129},{"id":335392570,"title":"‘Used and Abused for Decades’: Texas Lawmaker Seeks Overhaul of Temporary Protected Status ","text":"FIRST ON THE DAILY SIGNAL—A Texas congressman is aiming to reform the Temporary Protected Status program for migrants and to end the abuses of the program. \n\nRep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, on Thursday will introduce a bill that, if passed and signed into law, would grant Congress, not the president, authority to designate a foreign country under U.S. Temporary Protected Status. \n\n“Temporary Protect Status has been used and abused for decades by both Democratic and Republican presidential administrations,” Roy told The Daily Signal. \n\nTPS was first enacted in 1990 to protect foreign nationals from danger in their home county, but, as Roy pointed out, the program has long been abused and used as a tool to grant “soft amnesty” to millions of foreigners. \n\nThe Department of Homeland Security has the authority to designate nationals from a specific country eligible for TPS due to safety concerns that prevent them from returning to their home country, or other circumstances that prevent a nation from being able to handle the return of its citizens. \n\nThe secretary of the Department of Homeland Security may designate a nation for TPS if that country is experiencing an “ongoing armed conflict,” such as a civil war; is suffering from an “environmental disaster … or an epidemic”; or for other “extraordinary and temporary conditions,” according to the DHS. \n\nUnder the leadership of President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, and DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, the previous administration “quadruped the TPS population from 410,400 to 1.5 million in four years, shielding hundreds of thousands of economic illegal aliens from removal while providing them with work permits, serving as another ‘pull factor’ for illegal immigration,” Roy said, adding:\n\nNo more. The United States cannot, and should not, reward immigration lawbreakers with amnesty through the TPS program. \n\n“It’s time Congress end this abuse by taking away the TPS designation authority from the executive by having members of Congress introduce legislation—and vote on—issuing and terminating TPS designations,” Roy said. \n\nThe TPS Reform Act of 2025 would grant sole authority to Congress to vote on and approve a nation’s citizens’ eligibility for the program. \n\nWhile those who receive TPS are allowed to stay in the U.S. for between six and 18 months, that status can be extended indefinitely and “therein lies one of the major flaws in the way the law was drafted,” according to Dan Cadman of the Center for Immigration Studies. \n\nRoy’s bill sets an 18-month maximum length for a TPS duration and requires an additional congressional act to renew TPS designation. \n\nFurthermore, the bill would require TPS designations to include not only the number of foreign nationals who would be affected, but also the immigration status of those foreign nationals. Those who are already in the country illegally would not be eligible for TPS under the bill. \n\nDHS currently lists 17 countries with TPS designation: Afghanistan, Burma (Myanmar), Cameroon, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Haiti, Honduras, Lebanon, Nepal, Nicaragua, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Ukraine, Venezuela, and Yemen. \n\nUnder the Biden administration, additional nations were given TPS designation, and the terms of the program were expanded to accommodate more migrants. \n\nBiden granted thousands of illegal immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela TPS status, flying them directly into the interior of the U.S. \n\nAfter a legal battle, the Supreme Court ruled in May that the Trump administration could revoke temporary protected status for 500,000 illegal aliens living in the U.S. who entered under Biden’s Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela parole program.","summary":"FIRST ON THE DAILY SIGNAL—A Texas congressman is aiming to reform the Temporary Protected Status program for migrants and to end the abuses of the program....

But in securing this win, 33-year-old newcomer Mamdani hasn’t just shut out a titan of New York politics – he’s given the Democratic Party its first real jolt of energy since it lost the White House last year.\n\nMamdani’s victory wasn’t an “ABC” (Anyone But Cuomo) victory. For those outside the US – or even outside New York – Mamdani is a new name. He’s the son of Ugandan academic Mahmood Mamdani and filmmaker Mira Nair, and grew up partly in East Africa before settling in the city. Elected to the state Assembly in 2020 – New York’s lower elected house, closest to the UK’s devolved governments, Mamdani is part of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) and represents a gentrifying slice of western Queens.\n\nHe speaks the language of renters, immigrants and low-income workers – not in abstract policy terms, but with urgency and clarity. And that’s what made this campaign take off. His platform focused on freezing rent, expanding tenants’ rights, offering free buses, mostly paid for by a hefty new tax on the wealthy – solutions often dismissed by the establishment as too radical.\n\nMamdani ran a serious and organised campaign that beat its opposition with door-knocking, community trust and conviction. It’s a sign that the progressive movement is finally maturing: no longer just shouting from the sidelines, it’s now winning tough fights with party machinery.\n\nThe race also confirms my theory about something deeper in the current political mood. American voters, across ideological lines, are desperate for someone to “flip the f***in’ table”.\n\nI came up with that phrase while working on Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign last year, and I keep returning to it. People didn’t vote for Donald Trump because they admired his criminality, racism or misogyny – they voted for him, despite all that, because he was the only candidate who promised to break the system.\n\nWorking people don’t care who flips the table – Trump or Mamdani – as long as someone does.\n\nI’m incredibly proud to have worked on the Harris campaign, but we struggled to articulate a path to improving the lives of voters who feel locked out, left behind and lied to. The system isn’t working, and they didn’t see change in our campaign. Whether it’s the populist right or the democratic left, these people will rally behind whoever makes them feel heard. In 2024, that was Trump. Now, it’s Mamdani.\n\nOf course, Mamdani is not without controversy. He drew national attention for his past support for the Palestinian cause, including a 2021 protest chant to “globalise the intifada”. In a city with more Jewish residents than Tel Aviv, this would typically be politically suicidal. But Mamdani has made a sharp distinction between opposing Israeli government policy and antisemitism – a feat that seems to have eluded practically every left-wing politician on the planet (see Jeremy Corbyn). He’s spoken forcefully and repeatedly that Palestinian liberation must also mean protection for Jewish New Yorkers. \n\nAs Brad Lander – the Jewish comptroller of New York City, who ran a collaborative campaign with Mamdani to make the most of ranked-choice voting – told Stephen Colbert: “No mayor is going to be responsible for what happens in the Middle East, but there is something quite remarkable about a Jewish New Yorker and a Muslim New Yorker coming together to say: ‘Here’s how we protect all New Yorkers. Jewish New Yorkers and Muslim New Yorkers are not going to be divided from each other.’”\n\nSo what did Democrats just do? Whether they realise it or not, they might have finally chosen a direction. Mamdani’s victory won’t sit easily with the party’s corporate donors or centrist strategists – but then we tried their way in 2016 and 2024. Instead, it offers something they’ve lacked for months: a vision.\n\nMamdani’s win is proof that progressive ideas can win elections, that authenticity beats mediocrity, and that voters want more than messaging – they want someone who lives their struggles and means it when they say they’ll change it. Mamdani has finally done what I’ve advised, hoped and craved someone would: Flipped the f***ing table.\n\nNew Yorkers rightly crave a representative who understands what it is like to live in cramped, overpriced apartments and make long commutes on a struggling subway. A Ugandan-born socialist millennial Muslim may just have given the Democrats the shot in their arm that the national party needs.\n\nPablo O’Hana is a New York-based senior political advisor and campaign strategist, who worked on the Kamala Harris election campaign","summary":"In defeating a New York political titan to be the Democratic nominee for New York mayor,  Mamdani shows that voters wants someone – anyone – who will ‘flip the table,’ says campaign strategist Pablo O’Hana","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/nyc-mayoral-candidate-zohran-mamdani-democratic-socialist-b2777213.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/25/7/29/SEI256761702.jpeg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/mQEoBMpm-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-06-26 05:38:39","author":"Pablo O'hana","authors":["Pablo O'hana"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.112},{"id":335294586,"title":"GOP lawmaker silenced by woke state for exposing a trans athlete gets the last laugh","text":"GOP lawmaker silenced by woke state for exposing a trans athlete gets the last laugh\n\nREAD MORE: Simone Biles shares cryptic message after Riley Gaines feud \n\nBy JACK BEZANTS\n\nPublished: 05:30 BST, 26 June 2025 | Updated: 05:30 BST, 26 June 2025\n\nMaine state representative Laurel Libby has had her speaking rights restored by lawmakers, five months after being silenced for exposing a trans athlete online.\n\nIn February, Maine legislature voted to silence the Republican state lawmaker, who represents Auburn, after she revealed the winner of a state championship pole vaulting competition had finished fifth in a male event two years earlier.\n\nLibby shared unblurred images of the student, named them and circled them - sparking outrage among some across the state.\n\nThe Supreme Court restored Libby's voting rights on May 20 after she responded with a lawsuit. But her speaking rights had not been brought back, until Wednesday.\n\nShe said she didn't know for certain why her rights had suddenly returned but believes it could be due to a shift in public opinion over trans athletes in women's sports.\n\n'Democrats know that they are losing on this issue, that the majority of not just Mainers, but Americans, do not agree with their extreme stance allowing biological males to participate in girls' sports,' she said in a video on X.\n\nMaine state representative Laurel Libby had her speaking rights restored by lawmakers\n\nLibby made a post to Facebook last week of a transgender student standing on a podium after winning a girls state championship pole vaulting competition (pictured)\n\n'They know they're losing on that issue, they know that they're losing in the courts regarding my lawsuit that I filed… and so they caved because they know they're losing and this is the best way for them to save face.'\n\nAfter her controversial post back in February, Libby was called to a censure meeting where Maine House's Democratic majority passed a resolution finding her in 'clear violation' of the code of ethics.\n\n'I will not be silenced and I will not allow the voices of Maine girls to be silenced,' Libby said on X following the vote to censor her at the time. \n\nReflecting on the issue now, the 43-year-old Libby said on social media: 'When I spoke up back in February it was in defense of Maine women and girls who deserve a fair and safe and level playing field.\n\n'I was punished, political retaliation, for that. Today, Democrats put forward a house resolution to restore my voice and my vote. \n\n'The Democrats caved. They caved because they know they are losing.'\n\nDonald Trump repeatedly vowed to remove trans athletes from women's sports on the election trail last year before his sweeping victory over the Democrats and Kamala Harris last November.\n\nHe signed an executive order on February 5 titled 'Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports' barring transgender athletes from women's sports.\n\nLibby (right) pictured alongside Riley Gaines, a vociferous campaigner against trans athletes \n\nThe order uses Title IX, a law against sex discrimination in taxpayer-funded education programs, to ban transgender girls and women from participating in female school sports activities.\n\nIt authorizes the Education Department to penalize schools that allow transgender athletes to compete, citing noncompliance with Title IX, which prohibits sexual discrimination in schools. \n\nAny school found in violation could potentially be ineligible for federal funding.\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nGOP lawmaker silenced by woke state for exposing a trans athlete gets the last laugh\n\nAdd comment","summary":"In February, Maine legislature voted to silence her after she revealed the winner of a state championship competition had finished fifth in a male event two years earlier.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/othersports/article-14848635/GOP-lawmaker-silenced-woke-state-exposing-trans-athlete-laugh.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/26/05/99734363-0-image-m-40_1750911941648.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-26 04:30:55","author":"Editor,Jack Bezants","authors":["Editor","Jack Bezants"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.247},{"id":335292238,"title":"The socialist future of the Democratic Party","text":"One word that characterized Mamdani’s campaign was “free.” He promised free bus rides, free child care, and free healthcare. He also promised lower housing costs through more stringent rent control and lower food costs through government-run grocery stores. These policies would be a disaster for the city.\n\nNYC’s bus system is already not self-sufficient. It requires billions of dollars in aid from the government, and would only become less safe as the city’s already large homeless population would enjoy a new mobile shelter from the elements. A universal child care benefit would also be prohibitively expensive, as would Mamdani’s pledge to abolish private health insurance. In Chicago, Johnson’s government-run grocery store plan has already been abandoned, while his similar promise to build affordable housing has proved infeasible with single units costing over a million dollars each. Mamdani’s rent control plan would further discourage private investment in new housing, which would only raise rents overall as the city’s existing housing stock ages and declines.\n\nJohnson has raised taxes to pay for his socialist promises, and, in turn, both wealthy individuals and major corporations have fled the city to more sane jurisdictions. NYC is a special place, but so is Chicago, and more and more individuals and businesses have realized life is better in other locations. Mamdani’s NYC will most likely suffer the same fate.\n\nThen, there are all of the social justice features of Mamdani’s platform. While he walked back his earlier support for the “defund the police” movement, he supports creating a new “Department of Community Safety” that he says would take over certain tasks performed by the police, including “violence interruption” programs and responding to mental health-related 911 calls. While Mamdani says, “The police have a critical role to play,” in a world of limited government resources, this new department would only subtract from current police budgets. It is “defund” by another name.\n\nMamdani also supports other proven disasters, such as legalizing prostitution, decriminalizing drug possession, and an end to cash bail. New Yorkers should expect Mayor Eric Adams’s successes in lowering crime to be reversed.\n\nWe do not have any exit polling data to work with, but judging from preelection polls and precinct data, it appears Mamdani did best with young single college graduate voters who are seemingly whiter than the rest of the Democratic Party primary electorate. These are exactly the same voters that 2028 Democratic Party presidential primary candidates will have to excite and engage if they hope to secure the nomination. It is also the same group that powered the Sanders campaign in 2016.\n\nThe two non-socialists most happy with Tuesday’s results have to be Adams and Vice President JD Vance. Adams, who is running as an independent, believes his best chance of mounting a political comeback and winning reelection is against an avowed soft-on-crime socialist such as Mamdani. However, NYC is still far to the left of the average American voter, and Mamdani is likely considered the favorite heading into this November’s general election.\n\nThe same is not true of the 2028 presidential election. Former Vice President Kamala Harris could not run fast enough from the far-left positions she took in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, and Vance must be eager to see the 2028 field weigh in on the Johnson and Mamdani regimes. Mamdani is a far better communicator than Harris and is willing to own his socialist beliefs in a way she declined. However, defending the DSA platform in swing states such as Wisconsin and Pennsylvania will be much more difficult than in New York.","summary":"The first time Emerson College polled New York City’s Democratic Party primary for mayor this February, state Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani came in ninth, with just 1% of respondents supporting him.

It ain’t a hoax. I think the last 10 years have been the warmest on record,” Sanders said.\n\nBut Rogan quickly interrupted, referencing an article that he claimed pointed to cooling trends.\n\n“Did you see the Washington Post piece? … Essentially, they found that we’re in a cooling period. … It was a very inconvenient discovery, but they had to report the data,” Rogan said.\n\nSanders admitted he hadn’t read the article, responding, “Well, I’m not sure. I didn’t read that article.”\n\nRogan seized on that admission, arguing that “a lot of money is involved” in promoting a climate crisis narrative and accusing government institutions of exploiting environmental concerns for control.\n\n“There’s a lot of money involved in this whole climate change emergency issue.

An incompetent, corrupt government? This is the issue that people have,” Rogan argued.\n\nSanders conceded the frustration: “Fair enough. All right.”\n\nThe big finale came when Rogan raised a topic no politician wants to touch: the legitimacy of taxes.Sanders tried to score points by insisting the ultra-wealthy should pay their “fair share”—but Rogan flipped the script and challenged the very premise of taxation itself.… pic.twitter.com/uuVwNOuhZQ— The Vigilant Fox 🦊 (@VigilantFox) June 25, 2025\n\nSanders declined when asked whether he would consider another presidential run, citing his age. \n\n“I am 83 years of age,” he said.\n\nRogan replied, “You’re still very with it,” before pointing out that Sanders is still “a couple years older than Biden.”\n\nThe compliment landed awkwardly, with Sanders pausing in silence before responding flatly, “So…”\n\nThe final flashpoint came when Sanders blasted Elon Musk for donating $270 million to support President Donald Trump’s reelection campaign.\n\n“He spent $270 million to elect Trump.
