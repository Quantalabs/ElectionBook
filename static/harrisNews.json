The organization, which began in 2016, went from a fledgling local nonprofit to a phenomenon that received $42 million in donations from across the world.\n\nExecutive director Elizer Darris announced the nonprofit’s new focus Wednesday in an email to the nonprofit’s supporters, saying it will move toward “achieving long-term, systemic impact” beginning June 1.\n\n“Philosophically, we have come to a hard truth: We cannot bail and bond our way out of the harmful systems of pretrial detention and immigration detention,” Darris wrote.\n\nThe nonprofit will “reorient our efforts” toward advocacy, community education and “fighting for transformative change” in the pretrial and immigration systems, he said, and invest in strategies that “challenge the foundations of pretrial detention and immigration enforcement, not just their symptoms.”\n\nDarris noted that the fund has supported thousands of people and their families over the past nine years. In the years since Floyd’s murder, the organization put $33.2 million “directly into freeing people from cages and resourcing organizations in the fight for racial justice.”\n\nThe organization has also come under criticism from conservative media and others over instances where it has posted bond for someone who went on to reoffend.\n\nLast year, while campaigning for president, Donald Trump told a crowd at a rally in North Carolina that his opponent Kamala Harris had advocated for the fund and mentioned the St. Paul case of convicted murderer Shawn Michael Tillman.\n\nTillman was arrested in April 2022 for indecent exposure stemming from an alleged incident at the Capitol/Rice Street light-rail platform in St. Paul. He was released four days later after the Minnesota Freedom Fund posted his $2,000 bond.\n\nFive months later, on May 20, 2022, Tillman fatally shot 37-year-old Demitri Ellis-Strong at the Green Line Central Station on Fifth Street between Cedar and Minnesota streets in St. Paul.\n\nThe Minnesota Freedom Fund said in an Aug. 25, 2022, statement “we strive to balance pre-trial justice with community safety” when deciding to post bond for someone charged with a crime and in custody. Its post-release team attempted to contact Tillman, “as they do all our clients upon release, to offer resources and support,” according to the statement.\n\nDarris said in his Wednesday email that the organization will reevaluate its impact and sustainability after one year.\n\n“We’re proud of the impact our organization has had, and we want to ensure that we’re positioned to support our community until we end pretrial and immigration detention,” he wrote.","summary":"The nonprofit's executive director announced a new focus Wednesday, saying it will move toward “achieving long-term, systemic impact.”","url":"https://www.twincities.com/2025/05/14/minnesota-freedom-fund-to-stop-bailing-out-jailed-defendants/","image":"https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/20140624__jail_prison_skybox.jpg?w=650&h=433","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-14 23:49:50","author":"Nick Ferraro","authors":["Nick Ferraro"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.143},{"id":321411716,"title":"Bruce Springsteen Kicks Off European Tour Bashing Trump as ‘Corrupt, Incompetent and Treasonous’ | Video","text":"Bruce Springsteen took the time during his Manchester concert to go after President Donald Trump.\n\nIn the midst of the kickoff to his European Tour, Springsteen pulled no punches letting people know how dire he viewed the political situation back in the States.

Tim Walz feeds rumor mill about Derek Chauvin pardon, despite Trump saying he knows nothing about a reprieve","text":"Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and other Dem leaders are fanning the flames of speculation that President Trump is planning to pardon Derek Chauvin — the cop convicted of killing George Floyd — despite the president previously saying he hadn’t heard of efforts to grant a reprieve. \n\nSources close to the Department of Justice told The Post Wednesday that they had also heard nothing about a Chauvin pardon.\n\nThat didn’t stop Walz, Kamala Harris’ 2024 running-mate, from weighing in on online rumors. \n\nHe told reporters this week the Trump administration hasn’t signaled granting clemency to Chauvin, but argued, “With this presidency, it seems like that might be something they would do.”\n\n“If Donald Trump exercises his constitutional right to do so, whether I agree — and I strongly disagree with him — if he issues that pardon we will simply transfer Derek Chauvin to serve out his 22-and-a-half years in prison in Minnesota,” Walz said, per the Minnesota Star Tribune.\n\nMinneapolis Community Safety Commissioner Toddrick Barnette also made clear the city was ready for anything.\n\n“Since 2020, we’ve overhauled our emergency management plans and out of an abundance of caution are planning for any eventuality,” he said.\n\nHowever, even if Trump does pardon Chauvin, the ex Minneapolis officer would not be freed. \n\nHe was convicted of Floyd’s 2020 killing — which sparked protests and riots across the country — in both state and federal courts, so he would merely be transferred from federal custody to a Minnesota state prison.\n\nWhen Trump was asked by reporters at the White House about letting Chauvin off in March, he replied “No, I haven’t even heard about it.”\n\nUnrest over the murder of Floyd, who was black, resulted in weeks of protests and billions of dollars of property destruction. In Minneapolis, the local police precinct was burned down by rioters.\n\nChauvin pleaded guilty to federal charges tied to Floyd’s death in 2021 and was also convicted on state murder and manslaughter charges.\n\n“I really don’t know why you did what you did,” a federal judge told Chauvin during his sentencing in 2022.\n\n“To put your knee on a person’s neck until they expired is simply wrong. … Your conduct is wrong and it is offensive.”\n\nUnder Trump’s first term, his Justice Department opened the civil rights probe into Chauvin.\n\nSome MAGA figures have pushed for Trump to grant Chauvin a pardon.\n\n“I strongly support Derek Chauvin being pardoned and released from prison,” Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene tweeted Wednesday.","summary":"Sources close to the Department of Justice told The Post Wednesday that they had also heard nothing about a Chauvin pardon.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/05/14/us-news/gov-tim-walz-feeds-rumor-mill-about-derek-chauvin-pardon-despite-denials/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/104494430.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/Okkh3qFR-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-14 23:22:38","author":"David Propper","authors":["David Propper"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.889},{"id":321389502,"title":"Norah O’Donnell’s strong coverage of Pope Leo XIV’s election could be her ‘resurrection’ at CBS","text":"Norah O’Donnell’s career could get “resurrected” at the Tiffany Network — following her strong coverage of the death of Pope Francis and the election of Pope Leo XIV, The Post has learned.\n\nThe former “CBS Evening News” anchor — who was booted from the high-profile post in a controversial shakeup in January to make way for the duo of John Dickerson and Maurice DuBois — showed her chops as she amped up the network’s coverage from Rome last week, CBS insiders buzzed.\n\nThe 51-year-old broadcaster is “well sourced” in the Vatican, according to a network source. As she covered the funeral and the conclave with Dickerson, she flashed knowledge gleaned from an exclusive sitdown with Pope Francis last year.\n\nO’Donnell delivered an exclusive interview with the Gammarelli family, who have tailored garments for popes, bishops and cardinals for more than 200 years, and even nabbed perspective from an American bishop from Chicago, the new pope’s hometown.\n\n“Norah has the stature when it comes to doing a live event,” one network source said, adding that O’Donnell made DuBois and Dickerson look “small” by comparison and “overshadowed” them both.\n\n“Maurice looked like a bump on a log. He looked like her sidekick,” the source added. “John only knows how to do politics. They were outmatched.”\n\nDuring the conclave and last Thursday’s announcement of Pope Leo XIV, the perennially third-place CBS News easily beat NBC’s News in the ratings. CBS averaged 3 million viewers, compared to 1.9 million for NBC’s coverage anchored by Lester Holt. ABC News drew 3.5 million, according Nielsen.\n\nInsiders say the blip of success may have been an awkward moment for CBS News boss Wendy McMahon, who was behind the January shakeup. In the first quarter, the overhauled “CBS Evening News” saw its total viewers tumble to 3.5 million. Vewers in the advertiser-coveted demographic of 25-54 years, fell to 657,000, according to Nielsen ratings.\n\nThat’s versus the year-ago quarter when the show, under O’Donnell, pulled in 5 million total viewers and 722,000 demo viewers.\n\nThe fact that O’Donnell was able to steal the limelight last week is a perfect signal of the disarray at CBS News, according to one source close to the network.\n\n“You wouldn’t see ABC’s David Muir play backseat but that’s what Dickerson and DuBois did,” the source added.\n\nThe Post reached out to CBS News for comment.\n\nLast year, CBS CEO McMahon unveiled plans to revamp the 30-minute “Evening News,” which airs at 6:30 p.m. ET weekdays, to include “60 Minutes”-style segments. She moved the show back to New York from Washington and O’Donnell, who helmed the show for five years, was replaced by Dickerson, a CBS veteran and DuBois, CBS local news anchor in New York.\n\nThe program was forced to backtrack on the new strategy after it flubbed some major breaking stories following Trump’s election. Nevertheless, insiders aren’t holding their breath for O’Donnell to retake her anchor chair under current management.\n\n“Norah’s papal reporting may have resurrected her career but it could also just be her last hurrah,” a media expert said.\n\nThe slumping ratings, however, also come as Skydance Media is hoping to close its $8 billion merger with CBS-parent Paramount Global. A source close to the situation told The Post that Skydance bosses — which includes founder and CEO David Ellison and president Jeff Shell — are “profoundly unhappy with the current situation.”\n\n“They are going to be looking to reshape ‘The Evening News,’ which could include bringing back Norah O’Donnell,” a source said.\n\nWhile it is unclear if O’Donnell would return as anchor, a source with knowledge said the journalist, who lately has been relegated to reporting roles at the network, could land another big job at CBS once the new owners come in.\n\n“Something good is going to happen to Norah O’Donnell,” the source added. \n\nStill, it’s uncertain whether the merger will get cleared as it faces static from President Trump. Currently, Paramount is in talks with Trump’s lawyers over his $20 billion lawsuit over “60 Minutes'” editing of its sitdown with former Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump’s Federal Communications Commission chair Brendan Carr is also looking into the matter.\n\n“Actually, no one has given any thought to O’Donnell or ‘CBS Evening News’ as there are clearly other priorities to tackle,” a source close to Skydance said.\n\nSources also note that bringing back O’Donnell wouldn’t come without challenges and some internal backlash at the network.\n\nThe Post has previously chronicled O’Donnell’s toxic behavior, which includes dressing down stylists over her hair and makeup and requiring a “full dress rehearsal” of her broadcast when she was in the anchor chair.","summary":"The fact that O'Donnell was able to steal the limelight last week is a perfect signal of the disarray at CBS News, according to one source close to the network.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/05/14/media/norah-odonnells-strong-coverage-of-pope-leo-xiv-could-be-her-resurrection-at-cbs/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/104489942.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-14 21:26:27","author":"Alexandra Steigrad","authors":["Alexandra Steigrad"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.237},{"id":321399078,"title":"Frank Luntz Tells Gavin Newsom That Kamala Harris Should Look In Mirror To Find Reason She Lost 2024 Election","text":"Pollster Frank Luntz told Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom during a Wednesday podcast that former Vice President Kamala Harris had only herself to blame for losing the 2024 election to President Donald Trump.\n\nAmong registered voters who watched the Sept. 10 Harris-Trump debate, 63% thought the former vice president won the face-off, according to a CNN flash poll that surveyed 605 registered voters. Luntz argued on “This Is Gavin Newsom” that Harris should have won the 2024 election based on her debate performance and the exorbitant funds in support of her candidacy, but said she made critical errors that cost her. (RELATED: Harris Asked How She Will Make Life Affordable, Immediately Pivots To Word Salad About Middle Class Upbringing, Lawns)\n\n“On that [debate] night she won the election. Why did Trump win by such a big margin? It wasn’t even — for modern days, it wasn’t that close. Why did he win Michigan and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin … and Arizona,” Luntz told Newsom. “He won them because people thought he said what he meant and meant what he said. And while they didn’t like how he articulated it, which is exactly what’s happening right now, they wanted that agenda.”\n\nTrump secured all seven swing states and won the national popular vote by millions, according to the Cook Political Report.\n\n“Why did she lose when she had the election? She had more money than God, had an amazing debate performance that everyone saw,” Luntz said. “There was never another debate. She’d gone into the lead there.”\n\nHarris gained 1% after the debate, reaching 51% support from registered voters compared to Trump’s 47% among registered voters, ABC News/Ipsos data published Sept. 15 showed.\n\n“Why did she lose? She lost because of herself. In the end, it’s not just what’s going on around you,” Luntz added. “You have to tell people what you are for. You have to tell them what you will do and you have to be able to show that you can get it done.”\n\nThe pollster particularly noted how former President Joe Biden appointed Harris to address the illegal migrant crisis in 2021, saying she distanced herself from the role during her campaign.\n\n“I remember what a big deal it was when she was made the immigration czar. I was around. I saw this. And then during the campaign, she tries to run away from it. ‘Oh, I wasn’t important. I had nothing to do.’ Own it,” Luntz said. “Be sincere with people. Let them see you. Acknowledge, as I’m doing right here, right now, I got that election wrong. I knew Trump was going to win two weeks before, but I knew he was going to lose after that debate because no one had ever recovered from such a bad debate performance.”\n\n“Governor, the public deserves the truth. The public deserves candor. They have the right to know when we got it wrong,” he continued. “And if you can’t admit you got it wrong, then you probably don’t deserve to have your position. And they need to know what you’re going to do so you don’t get it wrong in the future.”\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Uproar over certain policies and uncertainty about which figureheads to get behind within the party have frayed internal cohesion.It is unclear whom the party will rally behind, as polling shows former Vice President Kamala Harris has most recently led the pack of potential presidential candidates, followed by Ocasio-Cortez, California Governor Gavin Newsom and former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.Since leaving office after President Donald Trump's January inauguration, Harris has kept a somewhat low political profile as rumors swirl about her potential future in federal or state politics.Ocasio-Cortez, however, has hit the trail across America, attempting to rally grassroots communities within the party to get reenergized about the Democratic movement following the election loss.What To KnowIn a new poll by co/efficient taken from May 7 to May 9 among 1,462 likely voters, 26 percent of those surveyed think no one is the face of the Democratic Party—tied with the 26 percent who think it is Ocasio-Cortez.Independent Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont received 12 percent of the vote, and Representative Jasmine Crockett of Texas received 8 percent.

When Lara Trump appeared on his CNN show in 2020 and brought up Biden's clearly visible impairments, Tapper addressed her as if she were a crackpot.\n\n'I think what we see on stage with Joe Biden,' Lara said, '... is very clearly a cognitive decline.'\n\nTapper's response? A smirk, a shake of the head, and a dismissive look down at his desk followed by a full-throated attack.\n\n'Okay,' Tapper sighed, communicating to his viewers how little he thought of her — someone he invited on his show . 'You have no — this is so amazing to me... You are mocking his stutter.'\n\nNO, she was not.\n\nJake then scolded Lara. 'You have no standing,' he harrumphed, 'to diagnose somebody's cognitive decline.'\n\nGuess who's doing just that right now? Jake freaking Tapper.\n\n'Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-Up' — aided and abetted by the mainstream media — 'and His Disastrous Decision to Run Again' is already a huge bestseller, and it's not even out yet.\n\nThis shows us the bottomless hunger for the real, unvarnished truth.\n\nAlas, it is not to be found in these pages.\n\nThe authors do throw us a few bones — like who was actually running the country. Tapper and Thompson tell us that it was a cabal of five people, including: \n\nMike Donilon, Biden's political director (who told Harvard's Institute of Politics in February 2025 that the Democratic Party 'lost its mind' in deciding to push Biden out)\n\nSteve Ricchetti, counsellor to the president (and longtime Big Pharma lobbyist)\n\nBruce Reed, White House deputy chief of staff\n\nRon Klain, longtime Biden loyalist who 'controlled a bit of everything.'\n\nA bit? Klain also told The Hill, in August 2024, that Biden was 'absolutely up to the job,' which was a blatant lie.\n\nThe fifth person running Joe Biden's White House remains unnamed. I think we all know it's Bad Dr. Jill, Nurse Ratched herself, Lady MacBiden.\n\nWhy do Tapper and Thompson spare her?\n\nHerein lies the problem: This book is clearly an exercise in what the military calls 'CYA' — better known as 'cover your ass.'\n\nAmong the sources, it seems, are Barack Obama, George Clooney, Kamala Harris, David Axelrod and perhaps Dr. Jill herself — because all get very glowy, velvety, sympathetic treatment and excuses as to why they sat idly by, for over eight years, despite everyone knowing Joe wasn't compos mentis.\n\nThe authors assert that Biden's decline was a well-kept Democratic party secret well before the 2020 run, and that Biden's team was 'elated' by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n'It was one of the best things to happen, ' the authors write, 'to Biden's presidential hopes.'\n\nThat's how power-mad, how cynical and uncaring, this entire cohort is, authors included. There's no outrage in this book, no palpable, well-directed anger. Nor is there a demand that these conspirators be held accountable for the greatest political fraud ever perpetrated against the American people.\n\nBut we do get, in the introduction, the authors telling us that this book in no way is an attempt to 'normalize' Donald Trump.\n\nThey still don't get it.\n\nInstead, Tapper and Thompson helpfully explain, for Barack Obama, why he — back then, the undisputed leader of the Democratic party — did nothing to keep Joe from running, either in 2020 or in 2024.\n\n'What could Obama do? ' they write. 'This was Biden's decision.'\n\nIt seems highly likely that Obama clearly fed the authors morsels in exchange for a kindly historical take.\n\nSame with George Clooney, who is lauded here as a living saint, the lone truth-telling Hollywood Dem who stands up to Steven Spielberg and Jeffrey Katzenberg — who were secretly helping Biden — and insists on writing that deadly New York Times op-ed.\n\nAn op-ed, by the way, that we are told Obama encouraged Clooney not to write. Sure.\n\nAnyway: Clooney, who has conservatively raised about $55 million for Democratic presidential candidates since 2008, decided to omit a most consequential detail from his op-ed, a detail he shared in Original Sin for the first time:\n\nWhen Biden arrived and stood before Clooney, the President of the United States failed to recognize him — a movie star with one of the most recognizable faces on the planet.\n\nAnd George Clooney chose not to tell us in his op-ed. What a patriot.\n\nBut our starstruck authors set the scene, failing to realize what a Marie Antoinette they make Clooney look like.\n\n'In his home office in the South of France' — gag — 'Clooney sat down at his laptop. '\n\nClooney, currently breaking Broadway box office sales records and receiving hosannas from the mainstream media for starring in a play — a polemic, really — about the importance of journalists telling inconvenient truths, had the gall to keep that secret.\n\nThe hypocrisy astounds. Truly, it's breathtaking. Again, the one unassailable takeaway from this book: EVERYONE KNEW.\n\nYet we had Jill and Joe Biden on 'The View' last week, those five pathetic, lapdog hosts nodding along as Biden called his presidency 'the most successful ever,' as Jill insisted that Joe — nodding off at the table, as she is saying this — worked 24/7, early mornings and late nights, there is never an off-switch for the president and certainly not for Sleepy Joe.\n\nHere is President Biden's daily schedule, as reported in this book. Note the lack of specifics. Note the lack of any detailed morning agenda whatsoever.\n\nLunch: 12:15-1:15\n\n'Desk time': 1:30-2:15\n\n'POTUS time': 2:15-4:15 (I suspect that's a nap)\n\nDinner: 4:30\n\nThat's all, folks.\n\nReally, that's all. Major events and players are omitted — just completely ignored. Kamala is barely present, which is how we know she, too, is likely a source.\n\nHer husband Doug appears briefly in a scene of humiliation, an enraged Rob Reiner — Meathead! — yelling at Emhoff, in late 2024, 'We're going to lose our f**king democracy because of you!'\n\nJen Psaki, who was Biden's press secretary for years and who told us, and tells us still, that she saw nothing, heard nothing and knows nothing, is depicted here as one of a very select few present for a post-mortem crisis meeting, after Biden seriously botched a major press conference.\n\nHer reward? A very cushy, high-paying job at MSNBC, where she 'reports' the 'news'.\n\nKarine Jean-Pierre? Nearly absent.\n\nHunter? The seamy stuff is buried, though we do get a hint that he relapsed as his father was being pushed out.\n\nDavid Axelrod? Could have blown the whistle anytime on CNN and chose not to. Yet he, too, is very solicitously depicted here as the epitome of avuncular concern.\n\nBiden's personal presidential doctor, Kevin O'Conner, who lied to us about his presidential patient for years? No big deal.\n\nAlso missing: The indisputable turning point of this election, the assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, Trump springing to his feet with blood on his face, fist in the air yelling, 'FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT!'\n\nThe contrast with Biden could not have been more stark: Strength and power vs. weakness and decline.\n\nHow could Tapper and Thompson ignore this? TDS is the only explanation.\n\nAlso missing are any details about who truly decided to withdraw from Afghanistan, who was overseeing the days-long catastrophe that saw Afghan mothers and fathers throwing their babies over barbed wire, that saw desperate Afghan men and boys clinging to departing American C-17s and falling to their deaths, and the inexcusable loss of 13 U.S. service members to a suicide bomber at Abbey Gate.\n\nNot mentioned is Biden failing to fire anyone for that debacle, which told America's enemies that we were weak and in retreat, so do what you will.\n\nOh, and not for nothing, but also running this White House was one Anthony Bernal, Dr. Jill's bitchy fashion stylist, who Tapper and Thompson tell us was practically running the West Wing.\n\nHow could this go on? One answer: Only with the complicity of the mainstream media.\n\nIf there aren't congressional hearings over this conspiracy, this epic lie that many geopolitical experts believe led to Russia invading Ukraine and Hamas attacking Israel, this country is in deep, deep trouble.\n\nSubpoena them all. Will anyone have the guts?\n\nIf you look at most mainstream media coverage of this book, the most devastating info has gone unreported — such as Biden needing a wheelchair, and his aides delaying that optic so he could win 2024 and they could stash him upstairs, dozing through a second term as they all got back to running the country.\n\nThe New York Times ignored this bombshell and pushed this story down on their home page, coverage reduced to a book review — a review that did not mention the wheelchair.\n\nCNN, Tapper's place of employ, still has no coverage on their homepage.\n\nABC, NBC, CBS? Same. And legacy media wonders why it sheds eyeballs.\n\nImagine if this were Trump — Trump, who this very media is beginning to imply, with zero evidence, is mentally ill (per The Hill and MSNBC's Lawrence O'Donnell, that puffed-up, self-impressed blowhard).\n\nDavid Plouffe — the Obama guy who took over Kamala's flailing campaign — is the rare source to issue a stern warning to his party going forward.\n\n'One of the great lessons from 2024, ' Plouffe tells the authors, is that 'never again can we, as a party, suggest to people that what they're seeing isn't there'.\n\n'Suggest' is too gentle a word. They'll never learn.","summary":"If there aren't congressional hearings over this conspiracy, this epic lie, this country is in deep, deep trouble. Subpoena them all.

That's a key finding in a newly released national poll from the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. According to the survey, only about one-third of Democrats are very or somewhat optimistic about the future of the Democratic Party. That's a steep decline from last July, when around six in 10 Democrats said they were optimistic. The Democratic Party has been in the political wilderness since last November's elections, when Republicans won back control of the White House and the Senate and defended their fragile House majority. And Republicans made gains among Black and Hispanic voters as well as younger voters, all traditional members of the Democratic Party's base. HEAD HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLLING The survey, conducted May 1-5, points to an increase in optimism among Republicans, with 55% more optimistic about the future of the GOP, up from 47% last summer. Since Trump's return to power, an increasingly energized base of Democrats is urging party leaders to take a stronger stand in pushing back against the president's sweeping and controversial agenda during the opening months of his second administration. And their anger is directed not only at Republicans but also at Democrats they feel aren't vocal enough in their opposition to Trump. And that's fueled the plunge in the Democratic Party's favorable ratings, which have hit all-time lows in several new polls so far this year. According to the AP-NORC survey, only around a third of all respondents have a positive view of the party. The GOP didn't fare much better, with only around four in 10 adults holding a favorable view of the Republican Party. KAMALA HARRIS TAKES NEXT STEP IN RETURN TO POLITICAL SPOTLIGHT Some top Democrats were sampled in the poll. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the longtime progressive champion and 2016 and 2020 Democratic presidential nomination runner-up, was viewed positively by roughly four in 10 Americans. But around three-quarters of self-described Democrats questioned held a favorable view of Sanders. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, the progressive firebrand who has teamed up with Sanders this year for a series of large rallies across the country, was viewed positively by only three out of 10 adults. Around half of Democrats held a favorable opinion of the four-term representative, who is seen as a possible 2028 Democratic presidential contender. There are also suggestions that Ocasio-Cortez may primary challenge longtime Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York when he's up for re-election in 2028. POLL POSITION: WHERE TRUMP STANDS 15 WEEKS INTO HIS SECOND PRESIDENCY Only 21% of adults view Schumer favorably. A third of self-described Democrats said they view him positively, but that's a dramatic drop from December, when half of Democrats questioned held a favorable opinion of the 74-year-old senator. Many Democrats heavily criticized Schumer earlier this year for his support of a GOP-crafted funding bill that kept the federal government from shutting down. The AP-NORC poll is the latest survey to spell trouble for the Democratic Party. The Democrats' ratings stood underwater in the most recent Fox News national poll at 41% favorable and 56% unfavorable in a survey conducted April 18-21. That's an all-time low for the Democrats in Fox News polling. And for the first time in a decade, the party's standing was lower than that of the GOP, which stood at 44% favorable and 54% unfavorable. The figures were reversed last summer, when Fox News last asked the party favorability question in one of its surveys. The Democratic Party's favorable ratings were well in negative territory in a Pew Research national survey – 38% favorable, 60% unfavorable – conducted in early April and at 36% favorable, 60% unfavorable in a Wall Street Journal poll in the field a couple of weeks earlier. And national polls conducted in February by Quinnipiac University and March by CNN and by NBC News also indicated the favorable ratings for the Democratic Party sinking to all-time lows. But there's more. Confidence in the Democratic Party's congressional leadership sunk to an all-time low, according to a Gallup poll conducted early last month. The confidence rating for Democrats' leadership in Congress stood at 25% in the survey, which was nine points below the previous low of 34% recorded in 2023. And the semi-annual Harvard Youth Poll, which was released late last month, indicated that approval ratings for Democrats in Congress among Americans aged 18-29 nosedived. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP An ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll conducted in mid-April indicated that more respondents trusted Trump (40%) than Democrats in Congress (32%) to handle the nation's main problems. The results came even as Trump's approval ratings have slid into negative territory since returning to the White House. And a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted late last month suggested Republicans hold a significant advantage over Democrats on two top issues: the economy and immigration.","summary":"More polling woes for the Democratic Party, this time from an AP-NORC poll that indicates that optimism about the party is plunging","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/four-months-trumps-second-term-democrats-remain-deeply-pessimistic-about-party","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/05/931/523/6d9939e8-kamala-harris-democratic-convention-address-chicago-8-22-24-scaled.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-14 20:34:20","author":"Paul Steinhauser","authors":["Paul Steinhauser"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.197},{"id":321395334,"title":"Dems won't be trusted if they don't admit mistakes, shrouding Biden's health","text":"“He totally f——ed us.”\n\nIt’s rare to hear a political party operative speak this way about one of his own. It’s almost unheard of to hear a well-known campaign adviser like David Plouffe speak this way on the record about the former president of the United States, Joe Biden. Especially in this Democratic Party.\n\nBut that’s exactly what he did, in a new book by CNN’s Jake Tapper and Axios’ Alex Thompson called “Original Sin,” which investigates “President Biden’s decline, its cover up, and his disastrous choice to run again.”\n\n“We got so screwed by Biden, as a party,” says Plouffe, who was a top campaign adviser to Vice President Kamala Harris in her 11th hour 2024 run, and former President Barack Obama’s campaign manager in 2008.\n\nPlouffe’s candor is refreshing — and necessary. After protecting Biden and misleading voters about his ability to beat Donald Trump and serve another term, it’s crucial that Democrats win back the trust of American voters.\n\nBut still nearly six months after the election, Plouffe was one of very few sources who would openly discuss Biden’s declining health and his insistence on running for a second term. Nearly 200 other sources remained anonymous, still unwilling to say what is obvious to so many: Biden cost the Dems the election, and helped put Trump back in the White House.\n\nTheir continued silence and refusal to admit their failures will only assure Dems remain deeply distrusted.\n\nThere are plenty of uncomfortable — and even infuriating — revelations in the book. Much of the blame is pointed towards Biden’s inner circle.\n\n“The Politburo,” as the book unflatteringly calls them, tried to control the damage of Biden’s declining health by shielding him from even his own staff, limiting working hours to urgent business only between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., telling speechwriters to keep his remarks brief and having him use the short stairs to Air Force One.\n\nCabinet meetings were mostly scripted for him.\n\nAides increasingly escorted Biden to Marine One in packs to hide his shuffle, and in case he fell. There were talks of putting him in a wheelchair after the election.\n\nJill Biden, his wife, was also reportedly unwilling to entertain any criticism or fears over his abilities, and became much more involved in his decision-making.\n\nBut even people who knew Biden well were shocked at his frailty and cognitive decline. According to the book, Biden repeatedly forgot the names of longtime aides and allies, including Mike Donilon, who had worked for him for more than 40 years. Biden also forgot the names of National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan and White House Comms Director Kate Bedingfield. He confused his Health Secretary Xavier Becerra with his Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, and Alabama with Texas.\n\nObama had to rescue his former veep several times at a fundraiser, finishing his sentences or reminding him who people were.\n\nGeorge Clooney, a longtime friend of Biden’s, was stunned when the president didn’t recognize him at a star-studded fundraiser that Clooney himself was hosting.\n\nEven amid these alarming details, which again only reaffirm what we could all plainly see with our own eyes, Bidenworld is remaining defiant.\n\nBiden’s spokesman Chris Meagher told The New York Times that they hadn’t seen the book yet. “We continue to await anything that shows where Joe Biden had to make a presidential decision or where national security was threatened or where he was unable to do his job. In fact, the evidence points to the opposite — he was a very effective president.”\n\nNot only is this the kind of blind loyalty Dems rightly scold MAGA Republicans for — failing to do the right thing if it meant crossing their boss — but it’s keeping the party from moving on.\n\nBiden’s media stops at places like “The View,” where he needed help from Jill to complete a thought, where he blamed Harris’ loss on sexism and racism, where he denied any cognitive failures and where he insisted he would have beat Trump, ensure the decisive 2024 loss continues to haunt both the party and the electorate.\n\nIn a new Echelon Insights focus group for Puck, some of the first words that came to mind when voters thought about the Democratic Party were “weak,” “corrupt,” “liars,” “ineffective” and “disorganized.”\n\nIn protecting Biden for as long as it did, the party failed to do its most important job: keep Trump from returning to the White House, where he’s not just back, but emboldened.\n\nIf they want to win again, they can’t just skip over these hard but necessary truths, laid bare in a book that attempts to do what many Dems apparently still can’t — on the record, anyway.\n\nS.E.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., dismissed the questions surrounding the latest book to come out with allegations of the president's decline on CNN, MSNBC and during a press conference on Tuesday. During an interview with CNN's Kasie Hunt, Schumer was asked, \"Did you really not have any idea that he was not fit to serve a second term?\" \"Kasie, we’re looking forward. We have the largest Medicaid cut in front of us. We have the whole federal government,\" he said as Hunt pushed back, noting the reason they were dealing with President Donald Trump now was because the Democrats lost in 2024. EX-BIDEN AIDE SAYS FORMER PRESIDENT WAS 'FATIGUED, BEFUDDLED, AND DISENGAGED' PRIOR TO JUNE DEBATE: BOOK \"Is that not Joe Biden’s responsibility for deciding to run again?\" Hunt followed up as the Democratic lawmaker repeated, \"We're looking forward.\" Hunt pressed, \"That's it?\" Schumer said, \"That's it,\" before the interview ended. While multiple books have come out about Biden, former Vice President Kamala Harris and the 2024 election, the most recent excerpts from CNN’s Jake Tapper and Axios reporter Alex Thompson’s upcoming book, \"Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again,\" detail several insider concerns over whether Biden could last a second term as president. The senator was also pressed on Tuesday by MSNBC's Katy Tur, who asked him to respond to a specific portion of the book that mentioned the Democratic senator. \"The book also reports that Biden put his hands on your shoulder and said, ‘You have bigger,’ I’m going to say huevos, it’s not what the book said, ‘than anyone I’ve ever met.’ Do you think Biden deserves the blame for the loss in 2024?\" Tur asked. \"Katy, we’re looking forward. We have the largest Medicaid cut in history facing us. We are focused on the future and doing right for the American people, plain and simple,\" he said. CHUCK SCHUMER CONFRONTED WITH OLD CLIP OF HIMSELF DECLARING BIDEN'S DECLINE 'RIGHT-WING PROPAGANDA' Tur followed up and asked if Biden actually said what was reported in the book, and he said again, \"We’re looking forward.\" The senator gave the same response during a press conference earlier in the day when a reporter asked if he was being straight with the American public in posting on X in June that the president was \"in command and impressive\" in meetings. The reporter juxtaposed Schumer's post with an insider describing to Tapper and Thompson a \"terrifying\" moment that same month when Biden failed to recognize award-winning actor George Clooney at a June fundraiser. Schumer dismissed the question, saying, \"We're just looking forward.\" NEW BOOK PLACES BLAME ON BIDEN FOR HARRIS 2024 LOSS TO TRUMP Asked by a reporter on Tuesday whether it was helpful for the Democratic caucus to have these books about Biden and the 2024 campaign, and whether he wanted Biden to help campaign for Democrats, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries deflected. \"We're not looking backward, we're looking forward at this particular moment in time,\" Jeffries said. Gov. JB Pritzker, D-Ill., said the commentary about the president's health was \"very backward-looking\" during an interview on CNN on Tuesday, but argued that the former president should have either stayed in the race or not run for re-election at all. He added, \"So I don’t know whether he should have been the nominee or not. I don’t really want to review all of it because it’s past history, and we live in a moment right now when 500,000 people in the state of Illinois are being told basically they’re going to lose their healthcare because of what the Republicans are doing.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., was confronted on Sunday by NBC's Kristen Welker about Biden's insistence that it didn't matter that he dropped out of the race in July, only giving former Vice President Kamala Harris about 90 days to campaign. \"You know, everything we look at in a rearview mirror after you lose an election. Yes, we would have been served better by a primary, but we are where we are. We’re not on the History Channel right now, and I believe that President Biden can come out and speak and do interviews whenever he wants,\" Klobuchar said. \"But I will say this: We’re not in the ‘History Channel’ and our Republican colleagues, instead of dealing with where we are now, think they’re in some kind of a way back zone, that they can go bring time backwards and blame everything on Joe Biden. Donald Trump is the president right now, and we have to deal with helping the American people,\" the senator added. After listing what she wanted the party to focus on going forward, the Democratic senator added, \"So I’m not interested in going backward in time. I’m interested in going forward.\" Some Democrats acknowledged that the president put the party in a tough spot when pressed on the book allegations, and on whether they should have held a primary. Rep. Morgan McGarvey, D-Ky., told MSNBC on Wednesday when pressed on Biden's decline and revelations from the book that he shouldn't have run for re-election, as he said he was going to be a transitional president. \"I don’t think he should have run for reelection. And I do think that it put the party in a much tougher spot to win, which we needed the best person on the field,\" McGarvey told MSNBC's Ali Vitali, citing Trump's policies and the high stakes of the election. \"We knew the stakes were that high, and we needed to make sure we had the best person on the field for the Democrats at that time.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said that Biden \"maybe\" hurt Democrats in running for re-election. However, Buttigieg defended the former president against allegations of decline. \"The time I worked closest with him in his final year was around the Baltimore bridge collapse. And what I can tell you is that the same president the world saw addressing that was the president I was in the Oval with, insisting that we do a good job, do right by Baltimore. And that was characteristic of my experience with him,\" he told reporters in Iowa this week.","summary":"Several top Democrats have told the press that they hope to look forward when pressed on allegations of former President Biden&apos;s decline, deflecting the questions.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/schumer-democrats-dodge-questions-about-brutal-biden-revelations-looking-forward-talking-point","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/05/931/523/dems-looking-forward.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-14 19:38:44","author":"Hanna Panreck","authors":["Hanna Panreck"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.086},{"id":321362536,"title":"Hakeem Jeffries dodges questions of Biden cover-up: ‘We’re not looking backward’","text":"“According to one rather stunning passage from the book, President Biden didn’t even recognize George Clooney at a fundraiser that the movie star was actually hosting for him,” CNN host Wolf Blitzer asked Jeffries on Wednesday on The Situation Room. “Why should voters trust Democrats when it’s clear so many in your party went to great lengths to keep Biden’s condition hidden from the public?”\n\nJeffries had no interest in discussing the revelation and quickly tried to steer the discussion to party talking points.\n\n“I can’t tell you what happened between George Clooney and President Biden, I wasn’t at that event. What I can say is that we’re not looking backward,” Jeffries said. “We’re going to continue to look forward, because at this moment, we’ve got real problems that need to be addressed on behalf of the American people, including the Republican effort to snatch away healthcare, snatch away food assistance, and hurt veterans.”\n\nBlitzer, not satisfied with that answer, continued to press the House Minority Leader.\n\n“You interacted with President Biden during those days, those final days he was president of the United States? Did you see, did you sense there was a major deterioration?” Blitzer asked.\n\n“Well, in the conversations that I was able to have on behalf of the House Democratic Caucus in those final days, we simply expressed our perspective as to what would be best for the party at that given moment in time,” Jeffries said. “President Biden subsequently made the decision that he was going to pass the baton to [former] Vice President Kamala Harris. Of course, that was a decision that we supported strongly.”\n\nClooney’s Democratic Party fundraiser, held in Los Angeles, California, raised a record $28 million for Biden. The event featured celebrity appearances, including Julia Roberts, Barbra Streisand, Jack Black, Sheryl Lee Ralph, Jason Bateman, and Kathryn Hahn. Musical groups The Silhouettes and Sista Strings were also present, with the latter performing ‘Lift Every Voice and Sing.’\n\nFollowing the fundraiser, Clooney flipped against Biden and called for him to step down.

We are grateful, and we are hopeful,” Stothert said.\n\nYet the surprise defeat seemed to spark fear among GOP members such as Gov.

Asked by CNN’s Manu Raju about a more specific anecdote from the book—that Biden appeared not to recognize George Clooney at a fundraiser the actor and Democratic activist was throwing him last June, the same month Schumer had described the president as being “in command and impressive”—the minority leader repeated himself: “We’re just looking forward.”\nHakeem Jeffries, the House minority leader, had a similar answer when he was asked about Tapper and Thompson’s reporting on Tuesday: “We’re not looking backward,” the New York Democrat told reporters. “We’re looking forward at this particular moment.”\nIt’s understandable why they’d want to. Details from Original Sin by Tapper and Thompson, which comes out next week, have painted a deeply troubling portrait not only of a man becoming increasingly unfit for the most powerful office in the country, but of an inner circle that sought to cover it up. Not only did Biden reportedly not recognize Clooney, whom he’s known for years; Tapper and Thompson report that he also forgot or confused the names of administration officials and close aides like Mike Donilon, who’d worked with him for decades. And it wasn’t only his cognitive decline, which reportedly disturbed some Democrats who hadn’t seen him recently; he was becoming so physically frail that aides had discussed the possibility he might need to use a wheelchair in his second term.\nBiden, meanwhile, recently launched a reputation rehabilitation campaign amid renewed criticisms of his decision to seek a second term and help doom the country to another four years of Trump. But it is also a stain on the party that indulged his hubris and insisted, to a public that continually expressed concern about Biden’s age, that everything was fine—that those worried about his capacity, even after flailing on the debate stage, were maybe even “bed wetters.” Democrats were warning—correctly—that Trump was an authoritarian disaster waiting to happen, with the blind support of Republican lawmakers. And here they were, the people who were supposed to be the adults in the room, asking their base to ignore their eyes and ears and support a man who was also unqualified for the job, albeit for entirely different reasons.\nWhen I talk to Democrats about what went wrong in 2024, they often speak of problems with the party’s “brand” or “messaging.” But the problem goes deeper than not being online enough or getting distracted from kitchen table issues—it’s that, in dismissing legitimate concerns about Biden’s capacity to serve, they undermined their credibility with the broader electorate and fostered disillusionment among their own base. Biden’s misguided reelection bid not only left Kamala Harris too little time to mount a successful run of her own; it also left her in the shaky position of having to either admit her boss may not up to the job he held and had sought to keep another four years, or to claim, as his second-in-command, that she had seen no signs of his decline. She chose the latter: “You never saw anything like what happened at the debate night behind closed doors with him?” she was asked by NBC News’ Hallie Jackson in the final weeks of the campaign. “It was a bad debate,” Harris replied. “People have bad debates.”\nThere’s a lesson there for aspiring party leaders like JB Pritzker and Pete Buttigieg, who have tried to tread carefully around the Biden revelations: As uncomfortable and politically risky as it might be to face up to Democrats’ Biden fiasco, there is more to be gained politically, in confronting it head on than in hoping the public forgets. Biden “totally fucked us,” as Harris campaign aide David Plouffe told Tapper and Thompson in the book. And if Democrats don’t break from him, he could continue to do so.","summary":"Party leaders understandably want to \"look forward\" amid new reporting on the former president's decline.

Klobuchar to accuse Trump of \"unprecedented overreach\" in speech","text":"Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar is set to give a speech on the rule of law and what she paints as President Trump's overreach on Wednesday night, as Democrats look to find effective messaging that will resonate with voters about the early days of the Republican's second term in the White House. Excerpts obtained by CBS News ahead of the event hosted by The New Republic show Klobuchar, a leading Senate Democrat who has not ruled out a 2028 presidential run, plans to make the case that \"Donald Trump is trying to remake the executive office into one that is immune from outside accountability.\" \"He's engaging in unprecedented overreach that disregards the rule of law and pretends as if the independent judiciary is a bug rather than a feature of our system,\" the Minnesota senator plans to say, according to the excerpts. Mr. Trump's first months since he returned to the White House have found the president and his allies leaning heavily on executive power. His administration has clashed with Democrats over its attempts at curtailing spending already approved by Congress and has tangled with multiple federal judges over immigration. Mr. Trump appeared to further underscore the tension between branches of government on Monday, when he posted on social media, \"if we're not allowed to send the murderers and other criminals of every type, size, and shape, IMMEDIATELY out of our Country, we aren't going to have a Country anymore. Radical Left Judges and politicians don't care, but 90% of the people in the U.S.A. do. Hopefully, the Supreme Court will agree with this and, SAVE AMERICA!\" Klobuchar, who is the leading Democrat on the Senate's agriculture committee and served as the Hennepin County Attorney in Minnesota before being elected to Washington, is also expected to try to put a real-world face on what she views as the impact of tariffs during Mr. Trump's second term. \"Who's the roadkill with Trump's tariffs?\" Klobuchar's excerpts show. \"The small businesses. The small farmers. The consumers who are facing a $4,000 tariff tax.\" Mr. Trump recently took to social media and defended his tariff policy, writing that \"the very STUPID Democrats are doing everything within their power to disparage what is happening. They are totally unhinged, and have lost all levels of Confidence. It is a financial REVOLUTION, and they are being Crushed.\" Minnesota's senior senator is viewed as a potential 2028 presidential candidate, after a 2020 primary run that saw her finish a strong and surprising third in the New Hampshire primary only to face struggles expanding her base of support shortly afterward. Klobuchar has not indicated whether she will seek the presidency in 2028, but did not explicitly rule out running when asked by \"Meet The Press\" moderator Kristen Welker on Sunday.Since her 2020 campaign, Klobuchar's political power has risen in Washington while she's also maintained a major focus on antitrust issues, a topic that is also interwoven into her approach during her upcoming remarks on Wednesday. \"We hear that phrase a lot these days – the rule of law. With our economy heading toward a cliff, you may ask – \"Why is this important to me?\" It's a legitimate question,\" Klobuchar is set to say Wednesday. \"My answer? Everything we hold faith in across this country — including our economy — is glued together by law.\" Klobuchar's speech comes as intrigue continues to swirl about who truly is the leader of the Democratic party after the setbacks the left faced in the 2024 election. Democrats are looking to chart a path forward after last fall's election saw the party lose the White House and Senate and fail to retake the House. At the same time, there's clear tension within the base of the party about the best way to politically challenge Mr. Trump after his convincing win in November. Even though national Democrats struggled in 2024, the Minnesota senator is fresh off a strong political performance in her home state. Last year, Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris won Minnesota by more than 4 points, in what amounted to a surprisingly close result in a state that has not voted for a Republican for president since Richard Nixon in 1972. Klobuchar in turn performed far better than the top of the Democratic ticket in Minnesota as she successfully ran for a fourth term, winning around 135,000 more votes than Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.","summary":"Sen.

She's been held at that facility since she was taken into custody by a Dalton policeman on May 5 on charges of making an improper turn and driving without a license.A college student who graduated from Dalton's high school last year, Arias Cristobal came to the U.S. without authorization in 2010. While she came to the U.S. as a child, she did not qualify for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy that currently protects half a million undocumented immigrants known as \"Dreamers\" from deportation. She arrived after the Obama-era program's June 2007 cut-off date.Before President Trump took office for a second time, Arias Cristobal — a young undocumented immigrant without a criminal record — would likely not have been arrested by ICE, even without the DACA protections.But in its bid to oversee what it has promised will be the largest mass deportation campaign in American history, the Trump administration has vastly expanded who can be arrested and deported, revoking Biden-era rules that directed ICE to focus on arresting people deemed to be national security threats, serious criminals and migrants who recently entered the U.S. illegally.On Monday, officials in Dalton dismissed the two traffic charges against Arias Cristobal, saying the police officer had stopped the wrong car. It was that traffic stop that landed Arias Cristobal in Whitfield County Jail, where she was detained by ICE. The county is one of hundreds of jurisdictions that have agreements to cooperate with ICE by turning over noncitizen detainees.Despite the dismissal of the traffic charges, Arias Cristobal continues to face deportation to Mexico, alongside her father, who was detained by ICE in April, also after a traffic stop. They're both being held at the Stewart ICE detention facility in Lumpkin, Georgia.In a statement to CBS News, Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said the facts in Arias Cristobal's case \"haven't changed,\" even after the traffic violations were dismissed.\"Both father and daughter were in this country illegally and they have to face the consequences,\" McLaughlin said. She did not dispute that Arias Cristobal and her father do not have criminal records.\"They're not criminals\"Ndaihita Cristobal said her daughter had an otherwise typical American upbringing in north Georgia, despite living in the U.S. without valid immigration documents.She said Arias Cristobal is an avid runner who competed in cross-country races in high school and worked as a babysitter.\"Ximena is a calm girl. She's dedicated to studying. She's a very active girl. She's a girl who sets goals for herself. She is very disciplined,\" Cristobal said in Spanish outside the family's home in Dalton, a city roughly an hour and a half north of Atlanta where half the residents are Latino, many of them immigrants.Cristobal said her eldest daughter is also very close to her two younger sisters — ages 12 and 9 — who are both American citizens. Aurora, the 12-year-old, said she's having trouble concentrating in school, as she's constantly worried about her family's fate.\"My family's a good family … they're not criminals,\" Aurora said. \"They might have came here illegally, but they came here to fulfill their dreams.\"Like her eldest daughter and husband, Cristobal is in the U.S. illegally. She has become the family's main breadwinner since her husband's arrest. Aurora said she's scared her mother could also find herself in an ICE detention center. \"She's the last hope we have. She's the grown adult that we have here. She's the one that's been working, paying the bills,\" Aurora said.Even in a ruby red Georgia community represented by conservative firebrand and immigration hardliner Marjorie Taylor Greene in Congress, Arias Cristobal's arrest has made many uneasy. President Trump bested former Vice President Kamala Harris by 44 percentage points in Whitfield County in the 2024 election.\"There's been an uprising of heartbreak for our community, because, you know, a lot of people felt like we were going after the hard criminals, and unfortunately, good people are getting caught on the wash on this issue,\" said Georgia state lawmaker Kasey Carpenter, a Republican who represents Dalton.Carpenter said he wrote a letter vouching for Arias Cristobal's character, calling her \"an asset\" for the local community.In a statement, Greene defended the handling of Arias Cristobal's case by immigration officials, saying the Trump administration is \"upholding our nation's immigration laws.\"\"While local Dalton officials dropped her charges, the facts remain: she was driving illegally without a license and has no legal basis to remain in the United States,\" Greene said.Since being taken into ICE custody, Arias Cristobal has been calling home daily from detention. CBS News was there when she called on Mother's Day.As her mother wept, Arias Cristobal said that, if given the chance to speak to the president, she would urge him to feel some \"compassion,\" stressing that she and her family members are not criminals. Her family's separation, she added, has been especially painful.\"The hardest part is being ripped away from each other,\" she said.","summary":"In her first interview since being detained by ICE, Ximena Arias Cristobal told CBS News said her biggest worry is not being able to stay in Georgia.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/georgia-teen-ximena-arias-cristobal-arrested-by-ice-faces-deportation/","image":"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/05/14/fa7f849b-5b12-4317-b2a7-5a04f08bd651/thumbnail/1200x630/6976d6d0c11deceb68921350c3f49704/screenshot-2025-05-14-at-10-49-15-am.png?v=d8ac70a2c93631c1c3223eab6ec7acf9","video":"https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/3754815_hls/master.m3u8","publish_date":"2025-05-14 17:59:00","author":"Camilo Montoya-Galvez","authors":["Camilo Montoya-Galvez"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.262},{"id":321341236,"title":"On education, Mississippi shows the way ","text":"It’s been lagging in population growth over the last decade and in the longer term. Mississippi topped the 2 million mark in 1930, and it got within 18,000 of the 3 million mark in 2018, 88 years later, but it has fallen by 55,000 since.\n\nMississippi has long been the state with the highest percentage of black residents, and black people have had, on average, lower incomes and educational achievement by various measures than others.\n\nThus, not much notice was taken in 2011, a decade after passage of the bipartisan No Child Left Behind Act, when Mississippi finished dead last in the National Assessment of Educational Progress tests in reading and math taken by fourth and eighth grade students. Louisiana, with the second-highest black population percentage, ranked 49th.\n\nThe 2024 NAEP tests produced some starkly different results. Mississippi jumped to No. 14 in fourth grade math and No. 9 in fourth grade reading. And when the Urban Institute adjusted the scores for various poverty measures, thus measuring students in one state with those in another of the same level of economic status, Mississippi ranked No. 1 in both fourth grade reading and fourth grade math.\n\nLouisiana ranked No. 2 and Florida No. 3 in adjusted fourth grade reading and Florida, Texas, and Louisiana ranked just behind Mississippi in fourth grade math.\n\nOn the eighth grade tests, Mississippi fell in the lower half of states in unadjusted reading and math scores. However, in the Urban Institute’s adjusted scores, Mississippi ranked fourth in reading, behind Massachusetts, whose unadjusted NAEP scores typically lead the nation, Louisiana, and Georgia. And on adjusted eighth grade math scores, Mississippi ranked first.\n\nThese astonishing numbers represent substantial and, so far as I know, entirely unpredicted progress in Mississippi, and just slightly less in Louisiana. They stand in vivid contrast to the national trend, as lengthy school shutdowns produced by powerful teacher unions in more “progressive” states resulted in sharply diminished learning and lower test scores.\n\nThe watering down of NCLB standards in the bipartisan 2015 federal education act has also produced less proficiency in many states. “States like New York and Washington, with powerful teacher unions,” RealClearInvestigation’s Vince Bielski writes, have been “tamping down rigor, such as testing for graduation and accelerated programs, to achieve ‘equity’ for disadvantaged students.”\n\nIn contrast, “Southern states have seized on a political environment that allows them to do the things that matter,” American Enterprise Institute education director Frederick Hess writes. “To drive improvement, it’s easier if you have the politics of Mississippi than the politics of Massachusetts.”\n\nAs a result, black and low-income pupils are getting a better education in Deep South states such as Mississippi and Louisiana than in the “progressive” big cities of the North.\n\nWhat is Mississippi doing right? According to the 74’s Chad Aldeman, over the last decade, it has deployed literacy coaches to low-performing schools, prompted schools to screen pupils early for reading problems, and required holding back third graders not reaching reading proficiency.\n\nSchools use “science of reading” phonics-based curricula, which require repetitive drills that education school professors and many teachers loathe, but young children thrive on. Parents are notified when their children are lagging and mobilized to help.\n\nOne gets the sense of group mobilization to encourage constructive learning rather than fostering grievance — something like the culture of mutual reinforcement that has produced so many successful black STEM graduates at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County’s Meyerhoff program.\n\nThree generations ago, from 1940 to 1965, millions of black people moved from places such as the Mississippi Delta to “the promised land” of cities such as Chicago. Today, young black people are receiving better educations in Mississippi than they are in Chicago, whose mayor, Brandon Johnson, is a former teachers union organizer.\n\nJohnson has the city government borrowing to pay for current spending on a contract with raises for teachers and administrators for a school system that parents have fled, with enrollment down 20% over the past decade. His fellow Democrats seem little bothered by this doubling down on a failed system. Former Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris’s 2024 platform talked about preschool and college loan forgiveness but said nothing about K-12 public schools.\n\nThose interested in doing so, and improving the life chances of disadvantaged children, need to look to Mississippi and to other mostly Republican-run states in the South, which have shown the nation the way without substantial spending increases.","summary":"Mississippi leads the nation.

To do so, they speak with renowned economist Dr. Richard Wolff about how ideas hatched in the classroom decades ago prompted economic elites to put the US on a treacherous path that would hollow out the middle class, suppress wage growth for working people, and ensure a future where only the wealthiest benefit from America's economic growth.\n\nProduction: Stephen Janis, Taya GrahamStudio: David Hebden, Cameron GranadinoPost-Production: Adam Coley\n\nThe following is a rushed transcript and may contain errors. A proofread version will be made available as soon as possible.\nTaya Graham:\nHello, my name is Taya Graham and welcome to the Inequality Watch. It's a show that seeks to expose the dangers of extreme wealth inequality and discuss what we can do to fix it and to do so, I'm joined by my reporting partner, Stephen Janis\nStephen Janis:\nTaya, thanks for having me. I appreciate it.\nTaya Graham:\nIt's good to have you. Now, this is a form to examine the facts and figures, consequences, and solutions for our current wealth and balance, which infiltrates every aspect of our civic life. On this show, we won't just tell you about inequality. We will dig deeper and show you how it works, how it affects your lives, and the political system that has grown inherently hostile to the working class. And to do so, we'll be joined by a guest who knows more about this topic than anyone I can think of. Dr. Richard Wolfe is an expert economist who's become YouTube's foremost public intellectual at the intersection of economics and politics. And his analysis of what is driving America's progression towards oligarchy has been critical for the movement to fight against it. And I know his historical context has helped me understand how politics can often sit decidedly downstream from economics.\nSo we're going to have Dr. Wolff respond not just to the report, but to some recent pronouncements from politicians on Capitol Hill who we interviewed and some recent moves by the Trump administration. But before we get to Dr. Wolff, we want to delve into a new report about the devastating impact of our decades long march towards wealth imbalance, and it's from the Rand Corporation. And reveal just how profoundly the inequities and unfairness are wired into the American economy. We will dig deep into the consequences of this stunning report and unravel deeper roots of unease. It is generated among Americans and how that lack of confidence in the system has manifested itself in the very tense politics of the present. But first, some of the details of the report itself. Now, as I said, it was released by the RAND Corporation. The premise of this analysis is relatively straightforward.\nThe authors take a look at working class income as a share of the overall GDP or all the goods and services produced by our economy in a given year. The study looks back 50 years to determine the share of income that went to working people and then compares it to the present. It's an indicator of how much of the wealth of the largest economy in the world goes to the people who actually make it work. And guess what? It's done nothing but drop consistently. Believe it or not, in 1975, roughly 75% of the total American economic output went to workers' wages. That's three quarters of all economic activity into workers' pockets. You heard that right? Nearly 50 years ago, workers were the biggest beneficiaries of our country's increasing wealth. But things have certainly changed. As recently as 2023, the RAND study found that the percentage had dropped dramatically to 46%. Over time, the share of the nation's income that goes to workers has dropped by roughly 30 percentage points. And where has that income gone? Well, not just to the rich or the very rich or the extremely rich, but to the insanely rich to the top 1%, although, and all they've done well, don't worry. In fact, the biggest bulk of the gain has actually gone to the 0.01%, not even the 1%, the actual\nStephen Janis:\n\nTaya Graham:\nThe iceberg 0.01%,\nStephen Janis:\n\nTaya Graham:\nMost absurdly wealthy group in America. And that income transfer has led to an astounding amount of loss of wealth for people who actually do the work to keep this country running. The RAM report estimates that since 1975, a jaw dropping $73 trillion of wealth has migrated from the working class to the elites. That's trillion with a T. That's twice the total annual output of our economy in any given year. And that trend is accelerating. That's because in just 2023, a mind boggling, 3 trillion additional dollars would've gone to working people if wages had garnered the same share of economic growth as they did in the 1970s. And all of this, of course, brings us back to the most stunning takeaway from these incredible numbers, namely that wealth follows power. And with power accumulating and concentrating in fewer and fewer hands, our democracy becomes unable to solve complex problems. And Steven, this sort of becomes a vicious cycle.\nStephen Janis:\nYeah, I mean, one of the things that I think that this report points out and sort of parallels that you need to bring up to understand just how catastrophic it's been, is the fact that we have been living in a progressively extractive economy. In other words, as the worker share has diminished the parts of the economy that actually produce things for people that are useful and improved, their lives has diminished. And that economy has come more and more extractive. And just to illustrate that point, to make it very simple, as you think about what share financial services have played in the economy since the 1970s where it was about two to 3% of the economy, meaning hedge funds, investment bankers, hedge funds actually didn't exist, but investment bankers, people who feed off the froth of the economy, well, it's tripled since then, tripled to almost eight or 9%.\nAnd at one point, just before 2008, before the great recession, about 40% of corporate profits came from companies that just did nothing but shuffle the deck and make money off of money. And so that illustrates what happens. And that's when you're talking about sort the political paralysis that precedes it because the more people are extractive, the more antagonistic relationship they have with the working class, working class doesn't become a group that you want to lift up and improve their lives. It becomes people that you want to extract money from and make their lives worse. And so I think that's what evolves in parallel, and that's where we see these sort of mean billionaires, angry billionaires all the time. They're always angry. Elon Musk is always angry, and Donald Trump is pretty much always angry. And it has to do with the fact that their relationship with the people who actually make this economy run has become purely antagonistic in the sense that their wealth is based upon extracting from people. So I think that's a good point, and that's what comes out in this report.\nTaya Graham:\nThat's actually such an interesting point, and I really hope Dr. Wolf will respond to it.\nStephen Janis:\nOh, he will.\nTaya Graham:\nAnd you're basically saying that bad policy follows\nStephen Janis:\n\nTaya Graham:\nIn a way that we can't see\nStephen Janis:\nBecause good policy requires collective thinking and it requires thinking that is most beneficial to everyone. That's a hard thing to do in a democracy. We don't understand that it's not easy to build a bullet train or to improve housing or to build more affordable housing. It takes concerted effort where people are kind of on the same page where I will benefit from what you will benefit. But when the economy becomes purely extractive and wealth is based on the power of accumulating so much that the people underneath you have no power whatsoever. You can't think big in that sense. You can think big on individual scale, but not collective scale. And I think that's what we're seeing,\nTaya Graham:\nSteven. I think this imbalance also destabilizes communities and makes them more susceptible to things like over-policing and economic exploitation. I mean, so many of the small towns that we covered\nStephen Janis:\n\nTaya Graham:\nAlso under economic duress, and they had issues with policing. They were overwhelmed by aggressive ticketing and fines and general overreach and overspending on things like law enforcement.\nAbsolutely. But these are questions we can put to our guests. Dr. Richard Wolf, I'm sure will have a lot of interesting things to say about all of it, and I'm sure most of you are familiar with him, especially if you're watching us on YouTube. Dr. Wolf is an esteemed economist and founder of Democracy at Work whose ability to analyze the economics of the present through the history of the past is unparalleled. He's also the author of multiple books, including his latest capitalism crisis, deepens, and he's perhaps one of the best people we know to break down the mechanics of how rampant inequality is reflected in the politics of the present. A topic of great importance now more than ever. Dr. Wolf, thank you so much for joining us.\nRichard Wolff:\nMy pleasure. I'm a big admirer of what you do as well, so this is thank an opportunity for me to join you, and that's worth it for me right there.\nTaya Graham:\n\nStephen Janis:\nYou, Dr. Wolf.\nTaya Graham:\nThat's so wonderful to hear. Thank you, Dr. So first I just wanted to address the Rand report, and to me the numbers were really quite shocking. So I guess my first question would be just taking in the raw numbers and weighing on the methodology, how does the economic share of wages drop so dramatically? I mean, how did the oligarchs pull this off basically? That's a good question.\nRichard Wolff:\nWell, first of all, let me reinforce, this is a very historic process. You don't see this very often. That is, you don't see changes this big in so relatively short a historical period. So yes, you're right to focus on it. It is stunning. And in order to explain it, you have to look at certain basic shifts here in the United States and in the global economy that span the last 40 years or so in terms of when this really took off. The 1975 is the right year for the Rand Corporation to have used because it is a crucial, not that particular year, but the 1970s are a crucial time. You should think about it as sort of the end of the very special situation that came out of the end of World War ii, 1945 to 75. Those 30 years were a period that the United States must have known, certainly the leaders knew could not possibly be sustained because all of the potential competitors in the world, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, were all destroyed.\nRussia, if you want to ask them, they were literally destroyed. Immense bombing had wrecked their train systems, their factories, their cities killed enormous numbers and hurt enormous numbers of their people. So they were finished. Whereas in the United States, it was radically other, other than Pearl Harbor, no bombs fell in the United States. Pearl Harbor happened as you know at the very beginning. So for the bulk of the war, the United States was immune as a percentage of our population. We lost many fewer young people in the fighting compared to every other one of those countries. Japan had an atomic bomb dropped twice, we dropped it, but nobody dropped anything comparable on us. So in those years, the world readjusted itself. The war forced it, and suddenly we saw very dramatically the end, the final end, it had been dying, but the final end of the British empire that had dominated the world for the previous two to three centuries, it was completely gone.\nThe jewel of the empire, India became independent in 1947. It was over and there was no one to fill that void, no one with one exception, the United States. So in a very short time, the global currency went from the British pound sterling to the US dollar from the British Navy being the power force of the world to the American military operation on a global scale with atomic weapons. You cannot overstress this. The only way Japan and the Europe were able to rebuild from the war was because the United States lent them the money to buy the equipment from the US with which to do that. So after the 1970s, all of that was over the 1970s were in fact a watershed. The great fear in the United States, the great fear was to slide back into the economic problems that the United States had had before World War ii.\nLet me remind you, 29 to the war or the great depression, the worst collapse of capitalism in the history of that system, even to this day, we have not had anything worse than the 1930s. So there was always a fear then that oh, what would happen if we slid back with that in the back of your mind? Then you get the results that the Rand Corporation, like many other investigations have shown that the response, and this is really important, folks, that the response of the capitalist class and who do I mean by that? I mean the people who are employers, the people who are in the position of hiring other human beings. The United States census tells us that 3% of the American people are employers, the other 97% are not. And what that means, whatever else you think, it puts that 3% in a position to make powerful decisions that the other 97% of us have to adjust to have to live with and basically have to accept unless we make a revolution, which as you both noticed, we have not had.\nSo here is what that 3% did, and then I'll stop. The 3% started, particularly in the 1970s, realized that the Europeans in the Japanese had recovered from the war as everyone should have expected them to do. They were still the Germans in the Japanese, hardworking, highly skilled engineer, modern country, all of that. And they understood that their place in the sun could only be achieved if they could outdo the absolutely dominant economy in the world, namely the United States. So they set their goals on producing goods and services that were either better than or cheaper than, or hopefully both what was done in the United States that made the United States great, which is why Americans discovered in the 1970s and eighties, the Volkswagen and the Toyota and the Nissan, and they fill in the blank. They did it. They did what they set out to do. They produced better cars so that even Americans bought them ahead of the Ford, the Chevy, the Chrysler and so on.\nAnd in that moment, the discovery of the American capitalist class was that if they didn't do something dramatic, they would be sliding downward as their former adversaries. The Europeans in the Japanese made their move, and that move was more and more successful with each passing year. So here's what they did. Number one, they made the decision to move the manufacturing base of the United States. Out of the United States. The working class in the United States had been so successful in pushing up wages over the previous century, a century in which profits froze faster than wages, but they rose fast enough right up until the seventies that the employer could share with the workers a modest increase every year that the union would negotiate. And when an employer didn't do it, the unions had the muscle to strike and to get it, and so wages were much higher.\nBut in the 1970s, the invention of the jet engine and the invention of the internet made it possible to supervise, organize, monitor a manufacturing factory in China pretty much as easily as you used to do it across the street in New Jersey or St. Louis or Chicago or where you were. So they left. The second thing they did was to take advantage of their history and to automate, to really go about systematically focusing on replacing these high cost workers, which they kept seeing as their great problem. Wages were lower in Japan, wages were lower in Europe, significantly so, and so they realized how do we do well? We replace workers with machines and the third action bring cheap workers here when it wasn't convenient to move production there where the cheap workers live, those three things, export of jobs, automation and immigration of working class people.\nThat is mostly people in their working ages, 20 to 50 who would come here with or without family. No one really cared but would work for Penny on the dollar compared to what Americans were used to. And I have to tell you that worked, that strategic move of the business class, those 3% who run the businesses work, they all did it. By the way, at the beginning. Many of them were hesitant. They didn't want to go to China. China don't speak English and China's far away and China's run by a communist party. Very scary, don't want to do it. But they had to because the first ones who did it made such profits that those who were not willing to go had to overcome their cautionary anxieties and go, but I want to stress here because Americans are being fed real nonsense about all of this.\nNo one held a gun to their head. The Chinese never had the authority or the power to make that happen. They might've wished it, they might've wanted it, but they never had it. This is a decision made by Americans and by the way, their counterparts against whom they were competing in Japan and Europe followed suit, also went to China. And exactly for the same reasons, which is one of the reasons Europe is in the trouble. It is in now Japan having difficulties that it is in now. The world has changed. The people's republic of China is an entity in the world economy, the likes of which we have not seen for a century. I need to explain to people so often, Russia, the Soviet Union, may and I underscore may, may have been an adversary, militarily may have been an adversary ideologically, but economically never.\nIt was much too poor. It could never hold a candle to the American economy. That was its Achilles heel. And then when it tried to match the arms race with the US, when it tried to control another country, Afghanistan, it discovered that it was simply too poor to pull that off. And having waited too late, it dissolved. It couldn't survive. No one has missed that lesson, least of all the people's republic of China. So they've been super careful. If you watch them now, they're still, when they don't actually need to anymore, be super careful. They don't impose tariffs on us until and after we do that to them. That's been their kind of behavior all the way through. But we Americans have to understand, we do not. We are not in position to win. We're not even in a position to fight another Cold war. China isn't the Cold War the way the Soviet Union was. The conditions are completely different. And if the United States pursues it, I as a betting person would bet we will lose. Not out of it, not that we aren't strong, we are not that we aren't rich, we are, but the world isn't a place where statements like we're rich and we're strong carry the day that\nIs over. And I think that is a necessary way to frame or to contextualize all of the other important issues.\nStephen Janis:\nWell, Dr. Wolf, thank you so much for laying that out. That is really fascinating. And I guess when we're talking about the Rand report, so they were at this sort of pivot point, they make this decision, was there an option to be more inclusive with the working class here? I mean, does it have to end up the way it did where wealth is so extremely unequal? I really appreciate the way you rooted that and we now kind of understand the mechanisms, but could they have done this a different way, in a way that would've led to less economic dislocation for the working class in this country, or was it just the table was set the way it was? That's a good\nTaya Graham:\n\nRichard Wolff:\nWell, the way I would answer it, which will upset some perhaps, but it's the only way that makes sense to me. If you allow the system to function in the normal way that a capitalist economic system functions, then I have to give you the answer your own words. That's the way the world was. That's the way decisions got made and it isn't neither surprising nor shocking that they were made in that way. Could you have had a different outcome? Absolutely. But in order to get it, and I'll describe it to you in a moment, in order to get it, you would have to change the system. And what I mean by that is you would have to stop making the decision based on what is profitable. Look, I'm a professor of economics. I have learned about capitalism as the profit maximizing system. That's what I learned, and I went to all the fanciest schools. This country has to learn it, and they tried their level best. Half of my professors were Nobel Prize winners and sitting next to me in my class at Yale where I got my PhD, was one of the very few women that took economics courses in those days, and her name is Janet Yellen.\nStephen Janis:\nWow. Oh my god. Wow. So you were there in the room where it happened,\nRichard Wolff:\nAnd I know these people personally because we all went through college and university together, et cetera, et cetera. If you make profit the guiding, if profit is the bottom line, which not only I was taught, but I have taught that to generations of students as a professor, then you get these results. If you don't want these results, you've got to deal with the way people are taught to make decisions. I'll give you the simplest example. If you move your manufacturing out of Pittsburgh and Cincinnati and St. Louis and all the other places, Detroit. I mean I love to use Detroit. In 1975, it had 2 million people. Today it has 700,000 people. I mean, that's it. End of conversation. That's called an economic disaster. That's as bad as having dropped bombs on that place and having killed all those people, obviously that's not what happened,\nBut they were driven out by loss of jobs, et cetera, et cetera. So if you move your manufacturing, what is going to happen? Well, we know what happened to the companies that did it. They profited, which is why they did it and keep doing it. But let's take a look, just you, me and the people participating here. If you produce it in China, it means you're going to have to bring it back 10,000 miles from Shanghai or any of the in order to sell it to the American public. And you all know you can go buy an electronic device or furniture or kitchenware or a whole lot of other things and it says made in China. Well, what's the problem here? The problem is you are be fouling the air with all the exhaust from all the freighters that are crisscrossing the ocean. What are you doing to the water? What are you doing to the fish?\nStephen Janis:\n\nRichard Wolff:\nDoing to the air? Well, here's the important thing. No one has to worry about it because the companies that profit, even though they cause all of that turmoil, which will cost a fortune if you even can clean it up, they don't have to pay a nickel. If they had to pay a nickel if they had to, they probably wouldn't have done it because the profit wouldn't have shown it as a reasonable thing to\nStephen Janis:\nDo. So just so I understand, you're saying that if the environmental costs were factored into this business decision to move everything to China, if the environmental costs were really factored in, then it wouldn't be technically profitable to have this kind of transcontinental business or not transcontinental transatlantic. That's\nRichard Wolff:\n\nStephen Janis:\n\nRichard Wolff:\nOnly amendment I would give you is it's not just the environmental costs. Let me give you a couple of other examples.\nStephen Janis:\n\nRichard Wolff:\nWhen Detroit and I love the city, I've been there, I've been taken through it, the people treated me one, I have no complaint about the people, but an enormous part of Detroit is empty, burned out neighborhoods, mile after mile. They took me through, I'm talking, I'm not secondhand this, I saw with my own eyes, this is a disaster for these people. They had to pull up stakes, leave their homes, leave their families, leave their churches if they had kids in school, those kids at a very important time in life when they're making friends and boyfriends and girlfriends, we yanked out of all of those relationships. One of the reasons all due respect that we have Mr. Trump in office is the dislocation of the white, particularly the white manufacturing working class.\nIt's been a disaster for our labor movement because our unions were concentrated in manufacturing and you lost them and their member. And then remember all the communities in which those auto workers who lost their jobs lived, the stores in those communities went belly up. The housing market in those communities collapsed. They were unable to maintain their schools. How many children's educations were interrupted, slowed down, deteriorated. This teach, if you add up all the costs, here's the irony. Every one of the last eight or nine presidents of the United States have promised in their campaigns to bring manufacturing back. Our current president makes a thing of saying over and over again, he's doing this to bring back manufacturing. None of them have done it. None of them have delivered on the promise. And we see why because private profit makes it. Well, let me give you an example. In his first presidency, Mr. Trump visited a factory in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, true temper or temper something, I forget the exact name. The factory made three quarters of all the wheelbarrows in the United States.\nTaya Graham:\n\nRichard Wolff:\nIn 2023, I just followed it through 2023, a venture capitalist bought the company out and did what they all do, which is carved it up into pieces, sold each of the pieces and made more money that way than they had to pay to get the factory in the first place. Today, that brand is still the brand of most wheelbarrows in America. But if you look at the label on the wheelbarrow underneath the same brand temper, whatever it was in small letters made in China,\nTaya Graham:\nIncredible.\nRichard Wolff:\nThat's how this works. If you leave the profit system in, if your loyalty to capitalism means that, then you've got a hard road ahoe because you've got to understand that commitment by you and by this society is producing the problems. Its presidents cannot and will not\nStephen Janis:\nSolve. So Professor Wolf, this is kind of profound. It's kind of effective because in Baltimore we have 11,000 vacant houses. I never conceptualized your thought of it that those ideas that were taught in that classroom, when you sat next to Janet Yell, and because we conceptualized profit in a certain way led to this destruction, which you kind of made an analogy to a war on the working class and cities like ours that were Baltimore is another example of postindustrial malaise. Absolutely. So you're saying how these ideas were conceptualized, how we thought about profit, what profit meant has as much to do with the destruction we see as even any other force. Is that what you're saying? I just want to understand because it's pretty\nRichard Wolff:\nProfound. Yeah, you've understood me absolutely perfectly. We live in a society. Look, it's really bad, you know that. I know that\nStephen Janis:\nAbsolutely.\nRichard Wolff:\nThat part of that understanding. I know a little bit about the history, that understanding is part of the history of where the Real News network comes from and what it was designed to do by the people who have worked at it all these years. It's an understanding, but we are now evolved enough in the United States that the taboo I'm about to mention doesn't have its hold anymore. And you were very kind at the beginning to talk about me being all over the internet. Believe me, I'm as amazed by that as possible because having been a critic of capitalism most of my adult life, I know that people approached me always as a kind of an odd duck. If I didn't have the credentials of the fancy universities, I wouldn't be in these auditoriums. I wouldn't be invited. It's not me, it's all the other you all know. You know how America works.\nI'm here to tell you. Yeah, we now have to do what we have been afraid to do for 75 years, as I like to say, Americans are good. We question our education system, our transportation system, our hospital healthcare system. My God, we are in the forefront of questioning institutions like marriage, heterosexuality and so on, and good for us that we open up those questions. But when it comes to questioning capitalism, oh, all the old taboo sets in and you're not supposed to go there. You're not supposed to. Here's the problem if you don't go there, if we don't go there, we are foregoing the solution to the problems. We say we. We should never have undone our manufacturing system that because there's anything special about it. But a balanced economy is a diverse one. Yes, we need service industry. Yes, we need, but we also need manufacturing.\nRight now, the most troubled part of our population are relatively less educated in the formal sense. Males without jobs and without any prospect forgetting them, those were the people who worked in manufacturing and a manufacturing job doesn't have to be dirty and dusty and it can be clean and in noling if you want it to be. All of that is within reach. Unless we hold on to the taboo and the only people left for whom that taboo works is the very elite that the Rand Corporation makes so clear to us sits at the top. If it weren't for them, I would be able to talk to 10 times more people and all the others like me. And I can assure you, I'm not the only one out there ready and willing to go would have the audiences that need to hear that message.\nStephen Janis:\nAmazing. You're asking the question, but I was just going to say Toay and to Dr. Wolf. I remember sitting in my macroeconomic was class and the professor said, all people make rational decisions. That was like the basis of it. Now it's all falling apart as Dr. Wolf. But go ahead. You had the next question.\nTaya Graham:\nI was just thinking that criticizing our for-profit system, the way we accrue profits and how\nStephen Janis:\n\nTaya Graham:\nConceptualizing even a person who is wonderful at accumulating those profits, how they're lionized, how they're\nStephen Janis:\nHeroes, right? The ideology. The ideology,\nTaya Graham:\nIt's such this incredible ideology built around it and tackling that as a last taboo is just so important\nAnd very powerful because I think people do sense the imbalance and that's why when tariffs were proposed by our president that people have the feeling, well, yes, we do want these jobs back, but instead the way tariffs have been implemented has caused a lot of confusion. And so what I want to know is if you've discerned any strategy behind it, but before I have you answer, I actually asked Senator Sanders about Trump's tariffs and what he was doing and I just want you to hear what Senator Sanders response was. And I just want to ask you a question. President Trump has been describing America as a sick patient and tariffs as secure. Do you think America is sick and what would you say should be the remedy\nSenator Bernie Sanders:\nIn America today? My definition of what is wrong with America is very different than Trump's. My definition of what's wrong is that we have three people in America who sat beside Trump in his inauguration who own more wealth than the bottom half of American society. My definition of what's wrong with America is we're the only major country on earth not to guarantee healthcare to all people as a human right, that our childcare system is broken, that 60% of the people in this country, as you've heard today, are living paycheck to paycheck, struggling to put food on the table. So that's my analysis, which is very different than Trump's. I happen not to believe in unfettered free trade. I helped lead the effort against nafta, PMTR, with China. I think we need trade policies that work for workers, not just the CEOs of large corporations. I think selective tariffs in the right time in the right place are exactly right. I think a blanket tariff in terms of what Trump is doing, which number one happens to be illegal, don't have the power to do that, and second of one will be counterproductive. Okay, thank\nTaya Graham:\nYou so much. So I guess my question for you is what do you think the approach should be with tariffs and what do you think of President Trump's approach so far?\nRichard Wolff:\nOkay, I won't comment on Bernie's response, although that would be a conversation I think we could profitably all of us have about the tariffs. Here's the problem. A tariff is a nasty action. It hurts other people. Americans love to imagine that somehow that's not the case. If you put a tax, let's take an example of our major trading partner Canada. If you put a tariff on the things that Canada ships into the United States, and remember, we have thousands of miles of unguarded border between our two countries and we are each other's major trading partner. We more important for Canada than vice versa because it's a much smaller country than we are in terms of population and activity, but nonetheless, we depend on each other. Okay? If you suddenly say that for every foot of timber Canada grows wood and we need wood for our housing industry and we bring it in from Canada, if every tree stump that we bring in has to now be paid for, so we have to give the Canadian company that cuts and ships the wood, whatever it costs to get it.\nBut now on top of that, the buyer in America has to give Uncle Sam tax. That's what the tariff is. The tariff is exactly the same as a sales tax, right? When you go to the local store and you buy a shirt, if you are in a jurisdiction that has a sales tax, you pay for the shirt and then on top of it, the cash register rings for you. The tax, the sales tax that is for you, an extra cost of that shirt or that pot or whatever you bought. A tariff is exactly the same. It's a sales tax on imported items, okay? This means that Americans will buy fewer of them because they have become more expensive. So a tariff imposes on the seller in this case, notice a American official not elected by any Canadian makes a decision, a tariff that hurts a Canadian lumber company. Same thing. If you put a tax on electricity, which US spies from Canada and from many other things, oil, gas, those are important exports. You are hurting them. You are telling them we here in America have some economic problems and we are going to kick you in the face to relieve ourselves.\nYou don't do that unless either you have a sense of entitlement that the whole world will hate you for or you feel you can browbeat and force them to accept it. And then you have the nerve, which by the way, president Trump did today with the visiting new leader of Canada. He told him today, we don't want to buy Canadian automobiles. We don't want to buy your steel, your aluminum. He mentioned half a dozen items. Well then only Mr. Trump could say that and seem, because I watched it actually live, seemed not to grasp that he was condemning major industries in Canada to unspeakable decline in a short amount of time. I mean, he's making Detroit's out of these places, but he's not elected by them. Why they are sitting there. These Canadians, you can be sure, and I can tell you this again from personal experience, they are sitting there transforming a really positive attitude towards Americans, which they had into a really deep hatred for Americans.\nYes, they understand Trump is not all American and they're not not children, but you are putting them and then now multiply this by virtually every other country on earth. Here's the irony. After World War ii, if you remember, the policy of the United States was containment. George Kennan was a great thinker in American political science. That was a strategy. So the Americans put bases around Russia and we isolated and we constrained Russia, the Soviet Union. Here's the irony. Today it is the United States pursuing that kind of policy, but with the absurd opposite result. We are isolating us. We are turning the whole world into looking at the United States, and understandably, I wish I could say they were wrong about it, but they're not.\nMr. Trump is doing unspeakable damage. Now on the economics, if you are going to put a tariff the way we are doing, and you're going to say as Mr. Trump does, I want automobiles to be built here. I don't want them to be built in Canada. I don't want them to be built in Mexico where a lot of them are. Well, okay, then put a tariff and hope cross your fingers that the profit calculations of the car companies will lead them to do what you hope they will do if you impose such a tariff. But here's the one thing you cannot do. You cannot say, here's the tariff, and then two days later take it away and then a week and a half later raise it up a bit more. You know why? Because that introduces uncertainty and here's why that matters. Go to any large company that's busy in Canada or Mexico or anywhere else. They hear about these tariffs and do they consider moving into the United States? Of course they do. They want to escape the damage that a tariff does to them, but to move back into the United States takes two or three years, costs a ton of money, and is an immense risk. If you have any reason to doubt that this tariff will stay the way it is, you would never do it.\nThat's why no one is going to do it. That's why that such a point policy. Policy is a roaring failure from the get go. Wow. He has economic advisors. I know them. Either they're intimidated and don't tell him these things or they tell him and he doesn't care or doesn't listen. I don't know. I'm not privy to that sort of thing, but I can tell you that the whole world watches this look, it was a long shot for him, which he didn't understand because he's not going to be president in three and a half years and most of these moves of companies, they take much longer than he will be president. So they have to worry that whoever comes in, Kamala Harris or anybody else will undo all of this, in which case they will have spent a fortune of money and moved and be regretful that they ever did it. They're not going to move there, they just aren't.\nStephen Janis:\nWell, Dr. Wolf, I've been really thinking about some of the things you've said, and a lot of us we're kind of naive. We always look at economics as a science, right, as a science. But from what you're telling me, economics as a philosophy and it's a philosophy, kind of turned somewhat as a religion where we're worshiping at the feet of Milton Freeman or something, and that where prophet has become invaluable, prophet is like the catechism or something. You can't question it, and I'm kind of profoundly affected by this because I did take micro macro and I feel like, wow, I was misled. I mean, you're talking profit has become sort of invaluable. You can't say anything against it, is that\nRichard Wolff:\nWhere we are? But let me correct you about something you said a few minutes ago, and you were very wise. If I heard you correctly. You said you sat in a course and the course began with the teacher saying to you, in this course, we assume that everybody is a rational person, who\nStephen Janis:\nThat's what was said.\nRichard Wolff:\nYeah, that's what was said. But you were clever when you said it a few moments ago in this program, I've got you here. You said you let us know that you thought that was nuts, what we were being told.\nStephen Janis:\nYes I did. Even at 19 years old I did.\nRichard Wolff:\nYes. Here you were 19 years old. You already knew that this was crazy. Well, let me just tell you, I am married. I've been married a very long time. I know I'm a dinosaur. I got married at 23. I'm still married to the same lady. Congrats.\nTaya Graham:\nThat's lovely.\nRichard Wolff:\nShe is a psychotherapist, and when I was a graduate student, we were just sort of getting together. Then when I was a graduate student, I came home one day and I told her that I had heard in my class what you heard, that economics is based on the notion that decisions are rational.\nShe fell off her chair laughing. She thought I was making it up to pull her leg to say something humorous. I said, no, there was no humor at all. And she said, oh my God. My whole field of psychology is an attempt to understand the very difficult combination of drives and urges and fears, half of which we're not even conscious of that determine RB, the notion we are all rational calculators of costs and benefits. She could finish the sentence. She started laughing again at the thought of mature men and women sitting around talking like that. It struck her as incredible,\nStephen Janis:\nBut why do we worship the notion of prophet if it's irrationally derived? Do you know what I mean? That's what I'm just thinking about. What you said was so profound because these were conscious decisions, but they really were also exclusive decisions. That's right. We are going to exclude the working class because of this idea of profit. How come we've come to worship at this idea of the science of it when it really is more like a philosophy, I guess is what I'm asking, because you're there\nRichard Wolff:\nWhen I teach it. Now, in order to get at this, when I teach it now, I say to the students, profits are part of the revenue when you sell, if you make shoes or you make software programs, when you sell your product, you get a revenue and part of that revenue stream comes into the pocket of the worker, and we have a name for that. That's wages and salaries, and another part of the revenue stream goes into the hands of the employer, and we call that profits. Now, if you want to make a economic system, have an objective, a goal, if you make it to profits, then you say the whole system is supposed to work to maximize what goes to a tiny minority of the people involved. Why wouldn't you say more democratic for sure that it is the wages that we are most interested in securing because that's where most of the people's needs lie with the wages and the salaries, not with the, and when I explain it that way, everybody nods. It makes sense if you don't explain it that way. If you explain it the way most universities and colleges do, and I still teach. I'm sitting here in New York City, I teach at something called the New School University,\nBut that's a recognized American university. But most of my colleagues, they continue to teach profit maximization as the royal road to efficiency it.\nStephen Janis:\nYeah, I mean, inequality is not efficient, right? That's right. Can you explain that a little bit? How inequality is not efficient economic\nRichard Wolff:\nPrinciple, you should have stayed with economics. You're getting perfectly well,\nStephen Janis:\nI blew it. I was an economics minor, English major as you can imagine, but never too late, right? But yeah, so inequality is inefficient, right? Professor?\nRichard Wolff:\nYeah, it's a terrible inefficiency. And again, you can see because nobody has to calculate it in a profit system. If inequality means that inner city schools across America can barely hold it together as disciplinary institutions, let alone chances to motivate, educate, and inspire young people who need it, then you are going to pay a cost in those kids' lives not being anywhere near the contributions that they're actually capable of not being able to earn the income that they need for their fear. The social cost of this is enormous to tell me that private profit doesn't see its way clear to deal with this is to tell me that we got a system that doesn't work well. It's making profit driven decisions that are outweighed by the social costs that these private profit calculators never have to take into account. And that's cuckoo. That's the distill way of organizing yourself, right? Yeah.\nTaya Graham:\nProfessor Wolf, you were mentioning how tariffs work, and I remember Peter Navarro, who's the White House senior counselor for trade. He said that the administration intends to raise 6 trillion over the next decade via these reciprocal tariffs and that this would actually shrink the annual trade deficit, which is about $1.2 trillion. So I would have a two-part question for you. So would the US government actually directly raise trillions of dollars via tariffs? And my second question, is a trade deficit really a bad thing?\nRichard Wolff:\nYes. It's a very, very old question. Okay,\nLet me make a parenthetical remark just to set the context. Tariffs are not, new. Tariffs have been used by many countries over centuries. I tell you this only because there is a vast literature that has developed in all modern languages about tariffs because they have been used so often and we have lots of empirical studies. Under what conditions did they achieve the goals they set? Under what conditions did they fail to achieve? I've taught courses in international trade, and there's a segment of the semester when you talk about tariffs. That's how established they are. So having said that and wanting to remain very polite, I would tell you that Mr. Navarro is considered even in the economics profession, to be, I'm searching for the polite word, difficult to take seriously. I'll leave it at that.\nTaya Graham:\nThat's very diplomatic.\nRichard Wolff:\nYes. So the notion of the trillions, there is no way to know how much money a tariff will raise. That's what the literature shows. Mr. Navarro should know that because it depends always on how people react. So for example, if the tariff, let me give you an example that's real. The best and cheapest electric vehicles in the world are currently made in China by Chinese companies, the most famous of which the BYD three letters, which stands by the way for the English words, build your dream. That's the name. The Chinese company took BYD. Let's say you wanted to get one of those cars, which by the way, you'll see on the roads of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Europe. The only place you don't see him is here. Why? Because of the tariff. The tariff now stands right now at a hundred percent. It was raised from 27.5%.\nThat's what Mr. Trump put on it in his first presidency, and Mr. Biden raised it to a hundred percent. So if you want a $30,000 BYD car or truck, you have to come up with 30 grand that goes to China to pay for the vehicle, and another 30%, another 30 grand, a hundred percent tariff go to Uncle Sam. So you would have to pay, or I would have to pay $60,000 for that $30,000 car. Now hear me out. Every competitor of the United States, every company in the world that uses electric trucks to get its inputs to ship its outputs, they are all able to buy the best and the cheapest truck for $30,000. But the American company that has to compete against them would have to pay 60,000 for the same truck. You know what that means? That America is shooting itself in the foot by what it's doing.\nIt's not going to make more jobs. And what are Americans going to do as a result? They're not going to pay the tariff. They're going to settle for a cheaper electric vehicle made by Ford or General Motors or Tesla or Toyota because it's not as good as the Chinese, but it isn't 60 grand. And so guess what? No tariff will be paid because Americans will get out of paying the tariff by buying the cheap car, buying the cheap truck with the end result. That step-by-step Americans will isolate themselves in a walled off tariff universe, which makes them progressively incapable of competing. Let me put it to you this way. I look at all of this as a professional economist, and my image is I'm watching one of those proverbial movie scenes where you see a train crowded with people having a good time, but from where you sit, you can see the train is heading for a stone wall. Oh, wow, Jesus. And you want to yell loudly, get off the train, but they're having such a good time telling each other's stories and drinking their cocktails that they simply can't\nStephen Janis:\nHear me. Wow, it's\nTaya Graham:\nA nightmare.\nStephen Janis:\nI'm just thinking about what you're saying. And so we have, as we discussed before, we have a irrational system that sort of presents itself with science, comes up to an irrational conclusion to create tremendous wealth inequality, which creates the conditions for a political class now that is making totally irrational decisions. And so are we looking at a point where capitalism is turning in on itself in America, because the elite said profit above all else, profit above people, and now people are pushing back. But what they're getting is actually not a good solution, but really irrational decisions that are kind of based on that irrational idea in the first place. Not to be too circular, but\nRichard Wolff:\nBecause of my time constraint, I have to get off, but let me end by breaking another taboo.\nStephen Janis:\nOkay, great.\nRichard Wolff:\nHere it is. The way this system is going, the way it is acting, it is doing exactly what you said, holding on to the taboo and building the conditions, which I know we haven't got there yet, but building the conditions where the next concept we will be discussing is revolution. You cannot do this to the mass of people. Our people are already showing many signs of extreme stress. Mr. Trump is an exemplar of where that stress can lead. It can go to the right, of course it can, but if it goes to the right, which it's doing now, and if the right proves itself unable to solve these problems, which it's clear to me it will, then the next step for the American people is to try to go to the left, which after all they did in the 1930s, there is no reason they can't or won't do it again. That's a wonderful\nTaya Graham:\nThing. Professor Wolf, I know you have a time constraint, but I was hoping I could just ask you one quick question.\nRichard Wolff:\nOkay. Quick.\nTaya Graham:\nOkay. The question is, I think this is really our most important question for you is what do you see on the horizon? What advice do you have for your average worker out there who's paying off their car or their home or their credit card, who doesn't have a whole bunch in their savings account, who doesn't make over $70,000 a year? What should we be looking out for on the horizon? I mean, we've talked about the macro economics. What can we do on the micro to protect our wallets? What do we need to look out for?\nRichard Wolff:\nWell, the first part of the answer is to be honest. If people say to me, which they do, is it possible by some mixture of good luck that this all works out for Mr. Trump? The answer is yes, that could happen. It's not a zero probability it could, but if you want me to tell you what I think is going to happen, I think it's going to be a disaster. And therefore, I would say to every working man or woman, any person, you must now be extremely careful about your financial situation. Don't make major expenditures if you don't have to. Hold on. Find ways of accommodating and economizing because there are risks now of a recession, which by the way, most of Wall Street expects later this year or early next year, there are serious risks of an inflation. There are serious probabilities of a combination of both of those things, which we call stagflation. And all of those are terrible news for the working class. And I'll add one more. Having told the working class for the last 70 years that there is this thing called the American Dream, and that if they work hard and study hard, they will have an entitled chance to get it, an nice home, a car, a vacation, a dog, a station wagon, all the rest of it.\nYou're not providing that now to millions of people. And if we have an economic crisis, and remember the last two were immense. The 2008 and oh nine crisis was very, very bad. And the 2020 so-called pandemic crisis. Also, if we have another one on those scales on top of the receding American dream, you are putting your working class under X extraordinary stress, and it would be naive not to expect extraordinary political ideological outgrowths from that situation.\nTaya Graham:\n\nRichard Wolff:\n\nStephen Janis:\nDr. Wolf, thank you.\nTaya Graham:\nWe appreciate you so much. So can\nRichard Wolff:\nWe take your class?\nTaya Graham:\nI would like to sign up, please.\nRichard Wolff:\nOkay. Send me an email. I'm sure we can work it out.\nTaya Graham:\nThat would be wonderful. I'm going to take you up on that. Yes, thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you so much,\nStephen Janis:\n\nTaya Graham:\nWe really appreciate you Professor Wolf.\nStephen Janis:\nWe take care. Bye.\nTaya Graham:\nWow. We learned something new from\nStephen Janis:\n\nTaya Graham:\nEvery time we ask a question,\nStephen Janis:\nI mean the discussion of economics, it always sort of presents itself with a science. Maybe that's one of the reasons I didn't pursue it because it felt scientific to me. But the way he unpacks it, you understand. You see, you, Vince, the philosophy that defines it, which is so profound. We don't even think about it. We accept it. Well, profit motive is the only thing. And look, I sound a little pollyannaish, but still to think about it in that context where he kind of turns it into a philosophy that you can kind of wrestle with and see the underlying assumptions is pretty powerful. And I really appreciate the way he does that, because we need to think of it that way. If we're going to survive the next decade, we need to think of it as something that comes with conscious decisions, not made from scientific analysis, but someone's preference. Preference of having inequality. And that's the preference you're expressing, right?\nTaya Graham:\n\nStephen Janis:\nThat's what Milton Freedom Express is, absolute inequality, because there can only be so many capitalists. So when he equated, and I thought about Baltimore does look like a war zone. I mean, our own city looks like a war zone, right?\nTaya Graham:\nOh, absolutely. I mean, we have 11,000 vacant buildings. A lot of them are burned out. We were just in Santown Winchester where Freddie Gray was killed in police custody. It doesn't look any different. Someone's living in a house that's connected to a burned out building with part of the roof\nStephen Janis:\n\nTaya Graham:\nI mean, how can you have hope to have any value in your home? How can you hope to have any wealth to pass on to your children when you have a home attached to a burned out building?\nStephen Janis:\nAnd I used to think of it like Baltimore. I would look a war zone like post drug war, but the way Dr. Wolf said it, it was really post economic malaise. It really was affecting me profoundly. But anyway,\nTaya Graham:\nWhat's interesting is the idea of interrogating the very base assumptions. I mean, for years he's been speaking about interrogating those base assumptions. Exactly the way we run. That's a better way our economy.\nStephen Janis:\n\nTaya Graham:\nIt is for profit. Is that the direction it should be? It should be for profit, or should it be for people? And he's asking us to really take a look at that, and I think people are finally now ready to at least ask these questions. It's no longer so taboo to even ask the question, which\nStephen Janis:\nIt was. It's interesting you called it taboo, because it really is.\nTaya Graham:\nOh, absolutely. It really is. Absolutely.\nStephen Janis:\nBut thank you.\nTaya Graham:\nWell, as we discussed, the Rand report is shocking and sort of makes a point about the uncertain times we're living in now. I mean, regardless of your partisan preference, it is undeniable that the curtain era is both turbulent and unpredictable, which is why the Rand Report meets such a deep impression for me, because along with the truisms, it revealed about how wealth inequality breeds more wealth inequality. I couldn't help but think of something else, a special type of influence that accompanies this kind of economic dislocation. And that's chaos. I mean, utter chaos. Just think about it, that shrinking piece of the pie for workers harms, people's lives, real lives, people with family, with loved ones, with children, with elders, people who watched as their incomes technically shrank, who could nothing as fewer and fewer of the benefits of the wealthiest country in the world, were not shared with them. I don't even think shared iss the right word here. Maybe denied or withheld. You know what? How about stolen? You know what? Pick your adjective. Pick your verb. But the effect is the same. But let's use the word stolen in this case.\nI mean, when you look at the numbers, I want you to imagine the lives that impacted and then imagine the chaos it created. All of us, no matter where we are in our lives, have experienced the trauma of losing a job or having trouble paying off a student loan or getting squeezed by your landlord or trying to figure out how you can pay for a car or fund your kid's education or take care of your grandma. All of us have confronted these choices and often ask a question, how can anyone afford this? And what the heck are we going to do? And don't even get me started about surprise medical bills. A fact that Bernie Sanders shared during his press conference pushing for Medicare for all. He said, think about this. 60% of cancer patients go through their entire life savings two years after their diagnosis, cancer patients and their families left destitute.\nAnd add to that, the even more disturbing reality that roughly 500,000 people a year are pushed into bankruptcy by medical debt. That's right, due to being in an accident or getting sick. How's that for the wealthiest country on earth? But it's also why this Rand report hit so hard, because it's not just about 50 years of a declining share of income. It's also about 50 years of chaos for working people. It's about five decades of shrinking paychecks, fewer opportunities, insane student loans and unaffordable housing. It's about the time we spend worrying about a utility bill or keeping a cell phone on or paying for an ailing parent that needs around the clock care. And even worse, it's often about keeping a job we don't even like just for the health benefits or working two jobs or even three, or working for a way to offers just enough to get by, but not enough to build a future.\nMeanwhile, the horizon and opportunities for the 1% keeps expanding. The future for them gets brighter and brighter and brighter while ours, the working people of this country gets dimmer and dimmer. In fact, today's conversation isn't just about numbers or charts or percentages on a page. It's about the lives of everyday Americans who have been systemically deprived of dignity, stability, and justice. By extreme wealth inequality, $73 trillion didn't just disappear. It was taken. It was taken from working families, from communities and from our collective future and handed over to a tiny elite whose power and influence grow more unchecked each day. This isn't an accident. It's a choice, a political and economic decision made by those who benefit the most from the imbalance. But here's our choice. We can stay informed, we can stay vigilant, and we can demand accountability, and we can refuse to accept a rig system is normal. This type of inequality thrives in silence, and I guess you can tell we won't be silent. Isn't that right, Steven?\nStephen Janis:\nAbsolutely. Clearly.\nTaya Graham:\nWell, I just want to again, thank our guest economist, Dr. Richard Wolfe, for helping us make sense of the dismal science and our current fiscal ups and downs. And of course, I have to thank you my cohost, reporters, Steven and Janice. Great. Thank you. I appreciate your insights in helping make this show\nStephen Janis:\nPossible. Absolutely.\nTaya Graham:\nAnd of course, I have to thank our friends in the studio, Kayla Cameron, and Dave, thank you all for your support and I want to thank you out there watching. Thank you for watching us. Thank you for caring, and thank you for fighting the good fight. My name is Taya Graham. I'm your inequality watchdog.

Stothert’s decisive loss is a significant change from the mayoral election four years ago, when she took 64% of the vote.\n\nEwing, who will be the city's first Black mayor, won by tying Stothert to President Donald Trump, saying that reelecting her would bring Omaha the kind of chaos Trump has unleashed upon the rest of the country.\n\nStothert tried to blunt those attacks by turning to right-wing culture war issues, saying, \"Ewing stands with radicals who want to allow boys in girls’ sports.\" Mailers in the race were also focused on that repulsive anti-LGBTQ+ message.\n\nBut the message fell flat, and she lost decisively. \n\nWorse for Republicans, Stothert’s loss is terrible news for Rep. Don Bacon, a Republican whose district includes all of the city of Omaha as well as some suburbs.\n\nIn 2024, Vice President Kamala Harris won Douglas County, where Omaha is located, with 54% of the vote, so the 56% Ewing won in the city is a slight overperformance. Meanwhile, Bacon barely won reelection last year, taking 50.9% to the Democratic nominee's 49.1%, so even a small swing toward Democrats would likely lead to his ouster in the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nAnd Democrats are poised to see a swing in their direction in the midterms. Democrats have overperformed in almost every special election held since November, with an average overperformance of 12% compared with Harris’ results last year, according to data maintained by The Downballot.\n\nIf that holds, it will be higher than the average Democratic overperformance in the 2017-2018 election cycle, before Democrats rode a blue wave to retake control of the U.S. House in the 2018 midterms. Democrats overperformed in special elections those years by an average of 10.6% compared with the results of the 2016 presidential election, according to The Downballot. \n\nBacon seems to understand his vulnerability. Reuters reported in late April that he is considering retiring from Congress rather than run for reelection. \n\nLosing Bacon—by retirement or election defeat—would be a major blow to Republicans, who are expected to have just a three-seat majority heading into the 2026 midterms. Without Bacon, Republicans’ chances at holding the House would be even more difficult.\n\nHowever, it seems Republicans are taking the wrong message about Tuesday's results in Omaha. Rather than calling for moderation or even a nominal check on Trump, the state's Republican Gov. Jim Pillen instead blamed Republican voters, who, in his words, “just didn’t get the vote out.”\n\n“This should not have happened,” Pillen said.\n\nBut that size of a swing toward Democrats from just four years ago isn’t primarily because Republicans failed to turn out. It was that voters in the city didn’t buy what Stothert was selling. And that’s a bad sign for the GOP next November.","summary":"Democrats pulled out an upset win in the race for Omaha mayor on Tuesday, ousting the three-term Republican incumbent in a race that ultimately wasn't close.\n\n\n\nDemocrat John Ewing defeated Mayor Jean Stothert 56% to 44%, according to unofficial results, giving Democrats the mayorship of Nebraska’s largest city for the first time in 12 years.

From Biden’s steep mental decline, the origins of COVID, the \"unfixable\" border to children undergoing sex changes, the liberal media was on the incorrect side of all of it. Suddenly, many are claiming to have seen the light. Or more precisely, to see that what they gaslit the rest of us about for the last few years was as true as it was obvious. DAVID MARCUS: JOE BIDEN IN A WHEELCHAIR? AT LEAST DEMOCRATS WOULD HAVE BEEN HONEST Normal, everyday Americans from coast to coast knew the truth about these matters long before the media’s recent revelations. Now, we're shaking our heads and wondering what on Earth took the news media so long? Take Biden’s clear and obvious unfitness for office. Conservatives not only noticed it years ago, we spoke, wrote and warned about it. But this week video re-emerged of CNN’s media guru Brian Stelter reacting last summer to the administration’s claim that old man Biden was fine, just a victim of \"cheap fakes,\" which we were given to understand were accurate videos, but still somehow disinformation. \"Let me explain,\" Stelter said, as if defining a long-standing media term of art that had not just been invented by a mendacious White House communications team. \"Cheap fakes are a little bit simpler, they’re cheap, they’re distorted, out-of-context videos, chopped up certain ways, constructed in certain ways, that’s what we’re seeing.\" That sound you are straining to hear is George Orwell doing a golf clap. And who can forget \"Morning Joe\" host Joe Scarborough insisting, weeks before Biden would be forced to drop out, that, \"This version of Biden, intellectually, analytically, is the best Biden ever,\" and \"Eff you if you can't handle the truth.\" The rest of us had watched for years as this version of Biden shook hands with the air, wandered aimlessly off stages, mumbled unintelligibly and declined to hold press briefings or cabinet meetings. Now that Trump is back in office, the media is rushing to explain that they were lied to, or that they \"missed the story.\" CNN's Jake Tapper and reporter Alex Thompson have a new book out about just how bad it was behind the scenes. But if we knew, how could they not have known? Similarly, we see a laundry list of \"now can suddenly be told\" stories about COVID. Turns out the Chinese virus did start in a lab, masks never worked, and that social distancing stuff? That was just kinda made up. God help you if you said any of those things three years ago. Liberal news outlets with age-old reputations in tatters are now running articles about all of these lies, and more, as if nobody could have known at the time. Yet, millions of Americans did, and were attacked for saying it. On the border, not only have the liberal media had to confess that Biden could have shut it down all along, the very real problems with untrammeled illegal immigration can no longer be ignored. Even in England, Prime Minister Keir Starmer has admitted that things have gotten out of hand with what he called a \"failed experiment\" with open borders. Now, he says, immigrants must learn English and assimilate. Who knew? Well, everyone with the ability to think critically. Finally, and most incredibly obviously, is the liberal media realizing what Monty Python realized in the early 1970s, that men cannot become women or have babies, as John Cleese’s character put it, \"I'm not oppressing you, Stan! You haven't got a womb! Where's the fetus going to gestate? You going to keep it in a box?\" Somehow, 30-40 years later, everyone, and I mean everyone, in liberal media took it as gospel that if a man says he’s a woman he is a woman and that he has a right to play women’s sports, in what seemed like minutes, thousands of years of human understanding was tossed on its head. And not treating confused children with life-altering drugs or even surgery was somehow \"transphobic.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION But again, actual people on the ground never really believed this. They saw the pictures of swimmer Lea Thomas towering over his female competition, they heard from brave athletes like Riley Gaines about how deeply unfair and frankly, humiliating it is to be defeated by a man in your own sport. And they knew children are not equipped to make decisions that will leave them sterile and even maimed for the rest of their lives. At least the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom finally got around to admitting what everyone should know: A woman is someone born biologically female, and not a male who pretends he is female. The question that nobody can answer except for liberal journalists themselves is whether they actually believed this procession of lies, even when almost everyone else doubted it, or whether they knew they were lies but peddled them anyway, at the cost of their own dwindling credibility. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Put another way, are they liars or just dumb? And make no mistake, there is a plethora of evidence for the latter. The liberal media thinks it can earn back the trust of the American people with these Johnny-Come-Lately apologies and admissions over things we all knew all along. They can't fool us anymore, but it looks like they can still fool themselves.

The two sides have entered mediation in the suit, which is occurring in the backdrop of a planned multibillion-dollar merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media. Trump has repeatedly criticized CBS and \"60 Minutes,\" especially after the program received an Emmy Award for the interview at the heart of his massive lawsuit against CBS. The lawsuit has drawn extensive attention, with critics of Trump expressing concerns about the First Amendment and government overreach. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and other Democratic senators have openly lobbied CBS parent Paramount not to settle the case and give Trump a victory. Kimmel also used his monologue to mock his employer, ABC, as well as the declining TV industry as younger Gen Z and millennial viewers move away from watching mainstream television programs. \"Deloitte just did a survey that showed that Gen Z and millennial viewers are spending more time on social media than watching television,\" Kimmel said. \"Yeah, no s---.

Of me, certainly,” Tapper replied. “I’m not going to speak for anybody else, but knowing then what I know now, I look back at my coverage during the Biden years — and I did cover some of these issues, but not enough — I look back on it with humility.”\n\nTapper and Thompson have been on a media tour this week to promote their book, which is set to be released on May 20. One “Original Sin” revelation that grabbed headlines was that Biden’s aides were considering if he would need a wheelchair if he was reelected in 2024. Another Democratic strategist told the authors that Biden “totally f–ked us” by staying in the race too long, giving Kamala Harris no chance of beating Donald Trump.\n\nSome on X and elsewhere have further criticized Tapper for publishing the book after he ridiculed those who have questioned Biden’s mental acuity in recent years. One notable example features a clip of Tapper ripping Lara Trump in 2020 for saying Biden was dealing with a “cognitive decline.”\n\n“I think you were mocking his stutter and I think you have absolutely no standing to diagnose somebody’s cognitive decline,” he told her.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, Tapper said his reporting showed there were “two Bidens” in the White House. One version of the president who was “workable, serviceable,” and another who was “non-functioning” who could not remember the name of aides or celebrity supporters like George Clooney. Tapper also said he and Thompson learned most of this after the 2024 election from “democratic insiders and operatives” — and what he heard “stunned” and “shocked” him.","summary":"The CNN anchor says criticism of how he and the press covered the former president is warranted\n\n\nThe post Jake Tapper Admits There Was &#8216;Not Enough&#8217; Media Coverage of Biden&#8217;s Mental Decline appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/jake-tapper-biden-mental-decline-media-coverage/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/jake-tapper-cnn.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-14 15:28:52","author":"Sean Burch","authors":["Sean Burch"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.221},{"id":321299142,"title":"Jake Tapper admits it’s ‘fair’ for conservatives to bash him over past coverage of Biden following bombshell book","text":"CNN anchor Jake Tapper conceded on Wednesday that some of the criticism he’s received lately from conservatives over his blockbuster book on Joe Biden’s decline is “fair,” claiming that while he did “cover some of these issues” during Biden’s presidency, it was “not enough.”\n\nAhead of this month’s release of Original Sin, a book Tapper co-authored with Axios correspondent Alex Thompson on the “cover-up” of the former president’s cognitive and physical deterioration and “disastrous” decision to run again, a number of juicy and eye-opening excerpts have been dropped.\n\nFor instance, Tapper and Thompson reported that Biden’s aides had serious discussions about the president potentially needing to use a wheelchair if he were to win re-election, noting that his physical decline had “become so severe” during the second half of his term. “Given Biden’s age, [his physician Kevin O’Connor] also privately said that if he had another bad fall, a wheelchair might be necessary for what could be a difficult recovery,” the book noted.\n\nAdditionally, the forthcoming book – which featured interviews with roughly 200 Democratic insiders following the 2024 election – claims that Biden didn’t recognize actor George Clooney during a Democratic fundraiser, former President Barack Obama rescued Biden numerous times during that same fundraiser, and a top aide had to shield the president from his own staff.\n\n“We got so screwed by Biden, as a party,” Kamala Harris campaign adviser David Plouffe said. “It’s all Biden. He totally f*cked us.”\n\nWith Tapper making the media rounds to discuss the bombshell revelations in the book, right-wing media figures have labeled the veteran anchor a “hypocrite” who is trying to “rewrite history” in order to “profit” from writing about Biden’s decline. In their view, Tapper was part of the “cover-up” in hiding the truth about the former president’s deteriorating fitness ahead of the 2024 election.\n\n“It is just patently insulting that Jake Tapper is trying to rewrite history while lining his own pockets in the process. He was very much a part of the media cabal who defended Biden,” Fox News’ media critic groused this week. \n\nCNN anchor John Berman brought up the cries of hypocrisy coming from MAGA critics during a sitdown with Tapper to discuss the book on Wednesday morning.\n\n“So, Jake, you’ve been at this journalism business for a long time, and you know that whenever you go out on a limb like you are right now, you get criticism from a whole lot of people. What do you think of conservatives now criticizing you and the media in general for how President Biden was covered during his administration?” Nerman wondered.\n\n“I think some of the criticism is fair, to be honest,” Tapper responded. “Of me, I’m certainly not going to speak for anybody else. But knowing then what I know now, I look back at my coverage during the Biden years – and I did cover some of these issues, but not enough. I look back on it with humility.”\n\nHe went on to say that throughout his reporting for the book, he learned that starting around 2019, there were “two Bidens.” On one hand, you had the president who “was perfectly workable, serviceable and seemed fine.” Meanwhile, you had another Biden who was “non-functioning” and couldn’t remember the names of his top aides while losing his train of thought at an alarming rate.\n\n“And that non-functioning Biden reared his head increasingly over and over. It really seemed to exacerbate and get much worse in 2023 and 2024,” Tapper added.\n\nIn the end, though, Tapper pointed out that it was the severity of Biden’s decline behind the scenes and the efforts by much of his staff to hide that fact from the American public that is the real story here.\n\n“What we learned stunned us, shocked us. And look, while it was very important and I’m not dismissing the coverage of Biden tripping on stage or falling off his bike, that was obviously indicative of something serious that was going on,” he said.\n\n“I think what we learned about the non-functioning Biden rearing his head – increasingly not being able to come up with the name of George Clooney, not being able to come up with the name of top aides in the White House – I think that really reveals something even more significant, something even more disturbing about a president that was not what we, the American people, should expect,” Tapper concluded.\n\nBoth CNN and Tapper’s publisher Penguin Press have pushed back on right-wing media for accusing the CNN anchor of not addressing Biden’s age and mental acuity during the former president’s time in office. In response to a Fox News Digital article that dissected Tapper’s coverage of Biden’s cognitive fitness, a CNN spokesperson took aim at the “bad faith allegations” against the journalist.\n\n“He fairly and accurately covered Senator, Vice President and President Biden through years of dogged Washington reporting, hitting every high and low of the former president’s political career. From the campaign in 2020 to 2024 when he dropped out, Jake raised concerns about President Biden’s mental stamina on his shows, questioned Biden officials directly about his health on air, and consistently encouraged open discussion and debate on the issue,” the spokesperson told Fox News.\n\n“Despite bad faith allegations otherwise, the record clearly shows Jake covered the Clooney op-ed, the Hur report, and Biden physical limitations,” the spokesperson added. “As noted, Jake also covered Biden’s physical falls multiple times, and he happened to be on assignment in Chicago off-air the day after his bike fall in June 2022.”","summary":"‘I think some of the criticism is fair, to be honest,’ Jake Tapper said on Wednesday. ‘I look back at my coverage during the Biden years – and I did cover some of these issues, but not enough’","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/jake-tapper-biden-book-conservative-critics-b2750918.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/14/14/00/cnn-news-central-(7).jpg?trim=0,50,0,50&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/5CcczwKg-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-14 15:28:35","author":"Justin Baragona","authors":["Justin Baragona"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.236},{"id":321405000,"title":"The Trump Effect Is Here: Democrats Sweep to Victory in Historic Upset","text":"The Donald Trump effect struck in Nebraska Tuesday night as Democrats snatched another public office away from Republicans by tying them to the president’s disastrous agenda. \n\nThe people of Omaha elected John Ewing Jr. to be the city’s first Black mayor, in a surprising defeat for Jean Stothert, the city’s three-term Republican mayor who outraised Ewing by nearly double, according to The Washington Post. \n\nAlthough the seat itself is nonpartisan, Ewing’s campaign was able to channel the voters’ negative feelings about Trump’s wild first few months in office into a victory over his opponent, who had supported the president’s run in 2024.\n\n“Let’s say no to the chaos and elect a mayor who will actually get things done,” said one ad run by Ewing’s campaign. \n\nStothert got in trouble for using the same anti-trans Republican playbook that Trump employed in his campaign. One controversial mailer distributed by a PAC on behalf of her campaign claimed that “Ewing stands with radicals who want to allow boys in girls’ sports.”\n\nBut Ewing said he’d made no such statement. “Nobody’s ever brought that question up. So I believe it’s a made-up issue by Jean Stothert and the Republican Party,” Ewing said, and his campaign sent a cease-and-desist letter to Stothert for the misleading attack. \n\nEwing’s campaign was then able to use his opponent’s attack to mock her focus on such a nonissue. “Jean is focused on potties. John is focused on fixing potholes,” read one ad. \n\nStothert’s campaign stood by the mailer, saying that it referred to groups that had lent their support to Ewing. During a press event last week, Stothert tried to defend herself, comparing the ads from the two campaigns.\n\n“I would bring it back to, ‘Why is John Ewing trying to relate me to Donald Trump and saying the city is in chaos?’” Stothert said. “Donald Trump has not called me and asked me for advice.”\n\nStothert has tried to distance herself from the Trump administration, which she initially supported. During an appearance on the daily podcast Omapod earlier this month, she said, “I can honestly say as a Republican, I don’t like everything [Trump’s] doing and decisions he’s making. I wish he’d slow down on a lot of these decisions he’s making. I don’t advise the president.”\n\nThis election indicated that Nebraska’s 2nd congressional district, which handily backed Kamala Harris during the 2024 presidential election, is emerging as one of the most contested battlegrounds for control of the U.S. House in the coming midterms. Republican Representative Don Bacon’s term will be up, and he will be forced to decide whether he will run for reelection in a district that includes the “Blue Dot” of Omaha.","url":"https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-effect-democrats-sweep-victory-150114185.html","image":"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/hRuv.o_h0psCzS8ICucCPA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTE0MTM-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_republic_521/8ca97f0a428811bc68dc35eb875d4323","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-14 15:01:14","author":"Edith Olmsted","authors":["Edith Olmsted"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.268},{"id":321279144,"title":"‘Hang It Around Their Neck’ — Against Long Odds, GOP Operatives Have A Plan To Win In 2026","text":"Whether it’s a 12-hour-long protest on the Capitol steps about inflation, assaulting police officers during a protest at an ICE facility, or the threat of ousting the newly-elected leadership of the DNC, it’s safe to say that since President Donald Trump retook the White House in November, Democrats have found themselves lost as a party, if not in total disarray.\n\nThe Democrats’ apparent lack of direction and constant infighting could help carry the GOP through a midterm cycle that, given historical trends, they appear destined to lose.\n\nOver more than a dozen interviews, party officials and GOP consultants told the Daily Caller that they have a plan to bring Republicans more victory in 2026 — and they’re fully intending on using the divisions in the Democratic Party to achieve this goal.\n\n“There’s an old rule in politics that I tell my clients, which is when your opponent is committing suicide, stay out of the way,” a national GOP operative told the Caller. “And that’s what the Democrats are doing right now.”\n\nDEMS IN DISARRAY \n\nIn stark contrast to the Democratic Party, the GOP is fresh off a week-long celebration touting the Trump administration’s success in the first 100 days of his second term. Six months after Trump was elected for the second time, and the party took both the House and the Senate, the GOP is in prime position to enact the MAGA agenda.\n\nDespite the celebration, the thought of the 2026 midterms still looms. The question of how to continue to capitalize on the nation’s massive shift to the right is on the minds of GOP strategists, top party officials and the White House.\n\n“What I am going to tell my clients is let the Democrats be Democrats. If they think that transgender issues and Harry Sisson and those guys are going to deliver them great wins, God bless them. Keep going, kids,” one Midwestern conservative strategist told the Caller. \n\n WOAH! This is the overflow area at Bernie Sanders and AOC’s rally in Salt Lake City, Utah today.

Just absolutely remarkable. pic.twitter.com/G8ByzLuF17 — Harry Sisson (@harryjsisson) April 12, 2025\n\nSince the 2024 election, Harris’s camp signaled that she wouldn’t make a decision about her political future until the summer. Joe Biden retreated to Delaware for a quiet life. Gavin Newsom launched a podcast. Gretchen Whitmer was spotted in the White House. And AOC and Bernie Sanders, two of the party’s furthest left candidates, stepped up to become the new faces of the Democratic Party.\n\n“Democrats may not know who their leader is, but we do – it’s the Jasmine Crocketts, the AOCs, and the Bernie Sanders of the party. We’ll elevate their most extreme voices, like Jasmine Crockett, because they are the ones running the party right now, and they couldn’t be more out-of-touch with what most Americans care about,” Abigail Jackson, the deputy communications director for the Republican National Committee, told the Caller. \n\nAndrew Clark, founder of Relentless Strategies, told the Caller that the media is primed right now to cover tension within the Democrat ranks and that Republicans can use this opportunity to push Democrats to be on the record talking about the division in their party. Alternatively, they can force them on the record defending unpopular policy positions – like men in women’s sports. Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff, who is running for re-election in Georgia, and Democratic Rep. Haley Stevens, who is running for an open Senate seat in Michigan, are both cosponsoring legislation that would allow men to compete in women’s sports, for example.\n\n“Get Democrats on the record talking about it, draw attention to it,” Clark told the Caller. “If the Democrats go on the record now, that’s what gets used for ads in the fall — that lays the foundation for what these Republicans can run on and what these Democrats have to defend.” \n\nIn November, nearly every area of the country shifted to the right. American voters signaled leading up to Election Day that they were worried, first and foremost, about Democrats’ handling of the border crisis and the effect ‘Bidenomics’ had on the economy. But voters were also heavily persuaded by the candidates’ views on transgender issues. According to an analysis by Future Forward, a Democratic super PAC, Trump’s most effective ad was one telling voters that Harris was for “they/them” but that he was for “you.” That ad shifted viewers 2.7 percentage points in favor of the now president.\n\nOne strategist told the Caller that getting Democrats to take the unpopular stance on 70-30 and 80-20 issues – like wanting men in women’s sports – can prove to be lucrative for Republicans.\n\n“It provides really kind of stark differences between our candidates and theirs that manifest themselves on the earned media front,” a GOP strategist told the Caller. \n\nThe Democrats’ collapse hasn’t just been on Capitol Hill, as one strategist pointed out. Across the country, Americans have protested the administration, especially Elon Musk’s role, by lighting Tesla chargers on fire, keying the cars and throwing Molotov cocktails at Tesla dealerships.\n\n 🚨 Woke Karen SPOTTED at anti-Musk protest in Tysons Corner 🚨 pic.twitter.com/53MuSja9wJ — Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) March 29, 2025\n\n“What am I doing about this? I’m just collecting footage, some of this unhinged protest footage, like … domestic terrorism and like people keying cars and looking completely out of their minds,” one national strategist focused on full service creative services told the Caller. \n\nThe strategist also pointed out that Democrats have rushed to back federal workers: “These overpaid suburban D.C., career bureaucrats… if that’s their rallying cry, I think that they’re in trouble in the swing states.”\n\n“I think any little bit of stuff that we have showing the Democrats spending a lot of time on those folks is going to be beneficial for us to hold, to have in the quiver to use,” the source added. \n\nTHE VIEW FROM THE WHITE HOUSE\n\nEchoing what the strategists pointed out, one top White House official told the Caller that the “big, beautiful” reconciliation bill will give them an opportunity to further bury Democrats on policy. \n\n“Like the big tax package and all this that’s come forward [in the reconciliation bill], we think there will be really popular things in there that 100% of Democrats will vote against, and then we will hang it around their neck like an anchor,” the official told the Caller. \n\nWhile nailing Democrats to unpopular policy positions and highlighting the ongoing disarray in the party is important, the White House believes that the president’s ability to deliver on his campaign promises will be the best advertising the party has going into 2026, the official told the Caller.\n\n“The big picture, the thing we’ve been most focused on so far, is just delivering the agenda that the president ran on, which is critical issue number one. We have to give the voters what they paid for to try to cement the coalition that brought him into office, which is, of course, the coalition that we need — at least some version — to turn up in the midterms in order to be successful where we want to be successful,” the senior White House official told the Caller. \n\n Inside the briefing room there is a packet of 100 ICE arrests made on every briefing room chair. pic.twitter.com/3wLyIZRBcl — Reagan Reese (@reaganreese_) April 28, 2025\n\nThat means delivering for voters on securing the southern border – which the administration has made leaps and bounds on. Illegal crossings were down roughly 95% in March from the monthly average during the Biden administration.\n\nIt also means putting more money into Americans’ pockets and addressing their concerns on the economy, something the administration is still trying to navigate as the stock market reacts to Trump’s tariff policies. The economy is something every strategist and consultant that the Caller spoke to agreed could tank the election for Republicans in 2026. And it’s an element the White House knows they have to address.\n\n“The question is, what does [the economy] look like, sort of Q2 of next year? And if we can get the economy really moving in the right direction … by the data it already is … But get people feeling that, then I think we’ll be really successful,” the official told the Caller of the White House’s plans to address the economy. \n\nWHERE TO FOCUS\n\nFixing the economy isn’t the only thing the party will be looking at the White House to do to help ensure the 2026 midterms are a building year for the GOP. Across the country, strategists, PACs and party officials will follow the White House’s direction on which states and races they should focus their time and resources.\n\nThe House of Representatives will be a big target focus, the White House official told the Caller, adding that “all of the swing districts, whether on the offensive or defensive side” will be a priority. \n\n“The Senate is probably in a little bit safer territory, but we think we’ve got a great offensive opportunity in Georgia, good offensive opportunity in Michigan, and potentially good offensive opportunity in New Hampshire,” the official said of the top targets for the party moving into 2026. \n\nThe NRCC plans to build on down-ballot gains with different demographic groups, including Hispanic, African-American, and young voters, one party official told the Caller.\n\n“I think for the Senate map, one of the things to lean into is the fact that Democrats don’t even want to be here,” one NRSC official told the Caller, mentioning all of the recent Senate Democrat retirees that have been announced. Sens. Dick Durbin of Illinois, Tina Smith of Minnesota and Gary Peters of Michigan have indicated that they will not be running for reelection in 2026.\n\n The map on the left is George Bush’s 6.68% loss in New Jersey in 2004.

The official noted that they would continue to monitor the race and would get involved if they felt Republicans were in “striking distance.”\n\nThat would “bode well for ’26 and in the future,” the official added.\n\nOn Monday, Trump announced an endorsement of Republican Jack Ciattarelli, who is the frontrunner in the primary.\n\n 🚨BREAKING🚨 Trump endorses Republican Jack Ciattarelli for New Jersey Governor pic.twitter.com/OZGkCgKHNr — Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) May 12, 2025\n\nPart of the puzzle to defeating the Democrats in 2026 and securing further victory for the GOP is capitalizing on what the party has only recently embraced: early voting and get-out-the-vote (GOTV) efforts.\n\nAmerican Majority Action’s Ned Ryun told the Caller that it comes down to the fundamentals: voter registration, more absentee voting, and embracing early voting where it benefits the party. Ryun also stressed the importance of the GOP – both on a national and local level – pressuring county clerks to clear their voter rolls of ineligible voters. In March, the Republican National Committee (RNC) requested all states provide the party information on how it maintains and cleans up its voter rolls, the Daily Caller previously reported. \n\nAfter working on the Wisconsin Supreme Court race, Ryun and his group are now shifting their focus to Virginia, where they plan to practice the “fundamentals.”\n\nNEW MEDIA APPROACH\n\nEarly voting isn’t the only new tool that the GOP harnessed for the 2024 election. Trump’s media strategy, which included appearing on podcasts and talk shows outside of legacy media programs, was a break from the traditional route politicians usually take on the campaign trail. It was also a strategy Harris and her campaign struggled to embrace, fumbling a potential interview with Joe Rogan that would’ve given the vice president a better chance at reaching independent and undecided voters. (RELATED: Joe Rogan Responds To Kamala Campaign’s Alleged Lies About Their Interview That Wasn’t)\n\nThe White House has indicated that the new media strategy is here to stay, shaking up the press briefing room to include new and independent media outlets and adding them into the daily rotation of reporters that cover the president.\n\n 🚨PRESIDENT TRUMP AND JOE ROGAN🚨 WATCH NOW 👇https://t.co/UmTD7VWR0X — Trump War Room (@TrumpWarRoom) October 26, 2024\n\nThe NRSC, meanwhile, is encouraging Senate Republicans to embrace this new approach — and create a novel media strategy of their own.\n\nA national Republican working on Senate races told the Caller that the NRSC advised each Senate office in February to have an active presence on social media and to draft up a new media engagement plan as part of a list of benchmarks meant to assist incumbents up for re-election in 2026.\n\nA month later, the NRSC encouraged incumbents to “lead the fight” for President Trump’s efforts to cut waste, fraud, and abuse from government spending through unconventional channels. Candidates were advised to “be a leader on cuts your senator is passionate about through regional and new media,” the source told the Caller.\n\nThe NRSC also appointed Senator Marsha Blackburn to be vice chair, with the expectation that she will assist Senate Republicans in breaking into the new media sphere.\n\nOne senator who took the new media strategy in stride was Senate Majority Leader John Thune.\n\nA Senate aide explained to the Caller that they first implemented the new media strategy when Congress was voting on the “Keep Men Out Of Women’s Sports Act.”\n\nSen. Tuberville had already appeared on Megyn Kelly’s independent podcast to promote the bill and the pair started a pressure campaign on X in support of the legislation. That “opened up the door” for Thune to use that outlet to publicly advocate for the bill. \n\n“She had a call with the leader [Thune] and it was him saying, ‘Look, this is a priority,'” the aide recounted to the Caller. “We gave her the exclusive so that she could be the one to announce when that vote would be taking place on her show. We gave that to her because we saw that as being the best place for it, because that’s where the conversation was focused.” \n\n .@johnthune – we need a vote in the Senate on the Protection of Women & Girls in Sports Act to make Trump’s hugely popular EO a LAW. Without that, the next president could undo it. Make the Ds opposed to 79% of the country ⬇️ go on record with a NO vote. Let’s go! https://t.co/2gUTzgQgJH — Megyn Kelly (@megynkelly) February 6, 2025\n\nAnother Senate aide told the Caller that it has been important to put members of Congress on hour-long podcasts in addition to quick TV hits because it helps show in-depth policy knowledge and allows constituents to get to know their senator on a more personal level. Some senators do podcasts that correspond with specific policy focuses, like cryptocurrency or culture war issues.\n\n“What has kind of been the playbook forever has been five minute Fox [News] hits, and you get your message out,” the Senate aide explained. “But people don’t really know you.” \n\nANGRY VS. HAPPY VOTERS\n\n“Policy is the politics,” is a message the Caller heard from nearly every consultant or party aide over the course of numerous interviews. The best message the party can campaign on, they stressed, is the president and the GOP delivering on promises made to the American people.\n\nThe fear, though, is that angry voters are typically more motivated to turn out in a midterm than happy voters.\n\nThe GOP has already learned this lesson from the special election in Florida’s 6th Congressional District. Although Republicans managed to hang on to now U.N. Ambassador Mike Waltz’s vacant seat, the March race was much closer than the party anticipated — particularly after Trump’s decisive victory just six months prior.\n\nThe party faced the hard truth that yes, voters upset with the current administration are more motivated to show up to the polls, one national GOP strategist told the Caller. However, the source noted that the tight race shouldn’t have been a total shock given how much money Democrats poured into the race.\n\n“Our people – they got the message on time, but it took them a little bit longer. And so they basically needed to be rustled up to say, ‘Hey, this is important.’ But once the message was delivered that, ‘hey, the President’s agenda is on the line,’ it was lights out,” the source told the Caller. \n\nThe White House feels similarly, one official told the Caller, acknowledging that, at a certain point, they can’t help but make Democrats angry if they deliver on Trump’s campaign promises.\n\nBut the official added that the fight in 2026 is really about inspiring the Republican coalition to keep fighting each and every election cycle. Voters need to understand that Trump’s long-term success is in many ways predicated on having a friendly Congress to codify his agenda through legislation, the official explained.\n\n“What it really comes down to is the Republican coalition … can we connect the need for a Republican Congress to Trump’s success in the minds of those voters that have really only turned out when Trump is on the ticket,” the official said.","summary":"'Let the Democrats be Democrats'","url":"https://dailycaller.com/2025/05/14/gop-strategists-consultants-democrats-disarray-2026-midterm-plans/","image":"https://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-2211800230-scaled-e1747233996311.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-14 14:49:11","author":"Reagan Reese","authors":["Reagan Reese"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.214},{"id":321274722,"title":"Trump team taunts Democratic 'big lie' that Kamala Harris could have won if Biden got out sooner","text":"Senior aides for President Donald Trump taunted Democrats as they reflected on the 2024 election, blaming President Joe Biden for not getting out of the race sooner.\n\nDemocrats and journalists argued that Biden was at fault for Vice President Kamala Harris' loss and that if she only had more time, she could have beaten Trump.\n\n'One of the big lies we've seen spreading around from the Democrat campaign pros, eg David Plouffe, is that Kamala was somehow disadvantaged by having a shorter campaign,' Trump's deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller wrote on X early Wednesday morning.\n\nPlouffe, a former Obama advisor who joined the Harris campaign to boost it across the Finnish line went on the record in an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper and journalist Alex Thompson to condemn Biden.\n\n'We got so screwed by Biden, as a party,' Plouffe said, who described the Harris campaign as 'a fu**ing nightmare' as they only had 107 days to campaign. \n\n'He totally fucked us,' Plouffe added, blaming him for choosing to run for reelection and waiting three weeks until after his disastrous debate performance before dropping out the race.\n\nBut Miller argued that the shortened campaign helped Harris avoid scrutiny of her record.\n\n'This was actually her single biggest advantage — as if planned from the beginning — it's what allowed the media to build a completely fictitious Kamala while sheltering her from all scrutiny,' Miller wrote.\n\nMiller argued the media was 'delusional' with their 'fawning coverage' of her at the Democratic convention when they nominated her to replace Biden.\n\n'Remember the nonstop pro-Harris media psy op and reinvention?' He asked.

Biden had long been gaffe-prone, but as he forgot familiar names and faces and showed his physical frailty, the authors write, aides wrapped him in a protective political cocoon.\n\nAt the same time, the book is so reliant on anonymous sourcing — very few aides or elected officials are quoted by name — that it reveals the enduring chill that Biden’s loyalists have cast over a Democratic Party still afraid to grapple publicly with what many say privately was his waning ability to campaign and serve in office. Already, Biden has begun pushing back against reporting on the end of his presidency, reemerging for interviews to try to shape his legacy.\n\nThe book does not contain any astonishing revelation that changes the broad perception of whether Biden, now 82, was fit to serve as president. Instead, it is a collection of smaller occurrences and observations reflecting his decline. The authors write about a “cover-up,” though their book shows a Biden inner circle that spends more time sticking its collective head in the sand about the president’s diminishing abilities than it does scheming to hide evidence of his shortcomings.\n\nThe New York Times obtained a copy of the book, which is set for release next Tuesday. Here are six takeaways.\n\nBiden forgot names, even of people he had known for years. \n\nDuring his 2020 campaign and throughout his presidency, Biden forgot the names of longtime aides and allies, according to the book.\n\nIt describes him forgetting the name of Mike Donilon, a loyal aide who had worked for him since the early 1980s, and failing to recognize actor George Clooney. He also forgot the names of Jake Sullivan, his national security adviser, and Kate Bedingfield, the White House communications director, according to the book, along with Jaime Harrison, whom Biden had picked to be chair of the Democratic National Committee.\n\nIn another instance, Biden confused his health secretary, Xavier Becerra, with his homeland security secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, the authors write. During a meeting about abortion rights, Biden confused Alabama with Texas, according to the book.\n\nPeople described as aides and allies told the authors that Biden appeared frail in meetings and that they had worried he might need a wheelchair in his second term. Cabinet gatherings were largely scripted for him even when journalists were not present, according to the book. In a rare on-the-record account, Rep. Mike Quigley, D-Ill., described Biden’s physical abilities during a trip to Ireland as similar to what he saw when his own father was dying of Parkinson’s disease.\n\nBiden’s response to the accounts is not included in the book, nor are on-the-record responses from many of the aides, Democrats and other figures it names. (Indeed, the extensive use of anonymous sources makes it difficult to confirm the accuracy of many of the claims.) Biden’s spokesperson, Chris Meagher, said the former president’s team had not yet seen a copy of the book and had not been consulted in its fact-checking.\n\n“We are not going to respond to every bit of this book,” Meagher said. “We continue to await anything that shows where Joe Biden had to make a presidential decision or where national security was threatened or where he was unable to do his job. In fact, the evidence points to the opposite; he was a very effective president.”\n\nFew Biden allies, even now, would speak openly about his decline. \n\nNearly a year after pressure from Democrats forced Biden to drop out of the presidential race, the book shows that the party remains unwilling to reckon publicly with its choice to back Biden as its nominee for as long as it did.\n\nThe reluctance of many Democratic leaders and insiders to voice criticism without the cloak of anonymity, even after their devastating defeat, suggests a lasting fear of speaking out. It also points to an awareness that saying now that Biden should not have run in 2024 could prompt questions about why they said nothing when it mattered.\n\nUltimately, the most powerful people in the party either made a colossal misjudgment of the situation or recognized the problem yet declined to press Biden or the White House about it.\n\n“No Democrats in the White House or leaders on Capitol Hill raised any doubts, either privately with the president or publicly, about Biden’s second run,” the book reports.\n\nThe authors write that Secretary of State Antony Blinken did gently ask Biden if he was ready to take on a reelection bid but that the president reassured him he would be fine. Ron Klain, Biden’s first chief of staff, also broached the subject of whether the president should run again in conversations with other staff members, according to the book, but it never went anywhere.\n\nDemocratic aides are seeking to shift the blame. \n\nIt is a long tradition for Washington bigwigs to use books to place the blame squarely on someone else. What’s unusual about this book is that just about all players who agreed to be interviewed — 200, the authors wrote — pointed the finger at Biden and his small circle of senior aides.\n\nThe book calls the inner circle of Biden aides who made decisions for, and controlled the flow of information to, Biden “the Politburo,” an unflattering reference to the Soviet Union’s policymakers during the age of communism.\n\nOne of the few people quoted on the record is David Plouffe, the former campaign manager for Barack Obama. The book describes him as coming out of retirement to try to elect Vice President Kamala Harris after Biden dropped out.\n\n“We got so screwed by Biden,” the book quotes Plouffe as saying, adding a more vulgar choice of words to describe what the president did to the Harris campaign.\n\nBut Plouffe’s assertions absolve him and other prominent Democrats of their responsibility for her defeat.\n\nOutsiders were shocked by Biden’s abilities. \n\nA theme throughout the book is that people who had not seen Biden in person for a long time were shocked by his appearance when they did.\n\nFormer Rep. Brian Higgins, D-N.Y., is quoted in the book as saying that Biden’s possible cognitive decline “was evident to most people that watched him.” David Morehouse, a former Democratic campaign aide turned hockey executive, said Biden “was nothing but bones” after seeing him in a photo line in Philadelphia.\n\nAnd Clooney, a prominent Democratic donor, was so upset about his interaction with the president that he wrote a New York Times opinion essay calling on him to drop out.\n\nOther outsiders raised alarms that went unheeded by Biden’s inner circle. Ari Emanuel, the Hollywood agent whose brother Rahm was Biden’s ambassador to Japan, wound up in a shouting match in 2023 with Klain over whether the president’s campaign should continue.\n\nOne Democrat quietly pushed for a Biden primary challenge. \n\nOne of Democrats’ biggest regrets about last year is their failure to hold a competitive primary contest. But at least one Democrat worked behind the scenes to try to make it happen, according to the book.\n\nIn 2023, Bill Daley, who served as White House chief of staff to Obama, sought to persuade Democratic governors including JB Pritzker of Illinois, Gavin Newsom of California and Andy Beshear of Kentucky to challenge Biden in the Democratic primary race, the book reports.\n\nHe found no takers.\n\nNow, of course, Democrats expect their 2028 nominating contest to be crowded and highly competitive. And with many in the party calling for generational change, some 2028 hopefuls who were stalwart allies of Biden in 2024 may face new pressure to finally address whether they were wrong about his capacity to be president.\n\nJill Biden’s protectiveness of her husband grew as he aged. \n\nAfter Biden, the book is harshest on his family’s closest aides. Anthony Bernal, the consigliere to Jill Biden, the first lady, draws some of the book’s toughest scrutiny.\n\nThe authors write that Bernal could shut down any conversation about the president’s age and mental acuity by telling fellow White House aides, “Jill isn’t going to like this.”\n\nJill Biden is described as a fierce advocate for her husband who did not care to hear any criticism of his abilities or political judgment and grew more involved in his decision-making as he grew older.\n\nWhen a donor suggested in 2022 that Joe Biden should not seek reelection, Jill Biden remained silent — a reaction she regretted and vowed not to repeat, the authors write.\n\n“I can’t believe I didn’t defend Joe,” she is quoted telling aides afterward.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.","summary":"A theme throughout the book is that people who had not seen Biden in person for a long time were shocked by his appearance when they did.\n\n\nThe post A book points to Biden’s decline and Democrats’ cowardice: 6 takeaways appeared first on Boston.com.","url":"https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2025/05/14/a-book-points-to-bidens-decline-and-democrats-cowardice-6-takeaways/","image":"https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/https___nytapi.wieck_.com_feed-photos_K6T9nRQk-6824ab1fae1fe-768x432.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-14 14:40:33","author":"Jake Tapper,New York Times Service","authors":["Jake Tapper","New York Times Service"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.282},{"id":321279130,"title":"Kevin O’Leary Causes CNN Panelists To Lose Their Minds After Calling Kamala Harris A ‘Loser’","text":"Instead of sucking up to the political and corporate powers that dominate America, The Daily Caller is fighting for you — our readers.

Additionally, Buttigieg – whose trip to Iowa this week sparked further speculation that he is seriously considering a 2028 White House run – when asked if the Democratic Party would have been better off if Biden had ruled out running for a second term as president, acknowledged that \"with the benefit of hindsight, I think most people would agree that that’s the case.\" Buttigieg's comments – as he took questions from reporters after holding a large town hall with veterans and military families in this eastern Iowa city on Tuesday night – came amid excerpts from a new book titled, \"Original Sin: President Biden’s Decline, Its Cover-up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again,\" which offer claims of a White House cover-up of the then-president's alleged cognitive decline. Biden dropped out of the White House race last July, one month after a disastrous debate performance with now-President Donald Trump that sparked a chorus of calls from fellow Democrats for the then-81-year-old president to end his re-election bid. He was replaced at the top of the ticket by then-Vice President Kamala Harris, who ended up losing November's presidential election to Trump. NEW BOOK PLACES BLAME ON BIDEN FOR HARRIS 2024 LOSS TO TRUMP When asked whether Biden experienced cognitive decline, Buttigieg told reporters that \"every time I needed something from him from the West Wing, I got it.\" BIDEN AIDES ‘SCRIPTED’ EVERYTHING, ALLOWED HIS FACULTIES TO ‘ATROPHY,’ NEW BOOK CLAIMS \"The time I worked closest with him in his final year was around the Baltimore bridge collapse. And what I can tell you is that the same president the world saw addressing that was the president I was in the Oval with, insisting that we do a good job, do right by Baltimore. And that was characteristic of my experience with him,\" he added. Buttigieg won the 2020 Iowa presidential caucuses and came in a close second in the New Hampshire presidential primary before Biden surged to claim the party's nomination and later the White House. While Iowa's caucuses for half a century kicked off both major political parties' presidential nominating calendars, the Democratic National Committee demoted the Hawkeye State on their 2024 schedule, and it is unclear if Iowa will regain its early state status in the 2028 calendar. WHAT BUTTIGIEG TOLD FOX NEWS - IN IOWA- ABOUT A POSSIBLE 2028 RUN However, Buttigieg's visit, along with his announcement in March that he would pass on a 2026 run for a Democrat-controlled open Senate seat in battleground Michigan, his adopted home state, are seen as signals of his interest in a potential 2028 national run. Buttigieg told a Substack author in a live interview hours before the town hall that when it comes to 2028, he would consider \"what I bring to the table.\" However, when asked by Fox News if the trip to Iowa – where he also gathered with staffers from his 2020 campaign and was followed around by a videographer from his political group Win the Era – was the beginning of an assessment period, Buttigieg said \"right now, I’m not running for anything and part of what’s exciting and compelling about an opportunity like this is to be campaigning for values and for ideas rather than a specific electoral campaign. So that's what I'm about.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP When told about audience members who said they supported him in 2020 and would be interested in backing him again if he runs in 2028, Buttigieg said, \"of course, it means a lot to hear that people who supported me then continue to believe in what I have to say.\" The Cedar Rapids event was hosted by VoteVets, a progressive group that represents veterans and military families in the political process. The group told Fox News that 1,800 people attended the event.","summary":"Pete Buttigieg, who served former President Joe Biden&apos;s Transportation secretary, says that his former boss&apos; decision to seek re-election in 2024 “maybe&quot; hurt the Democrats.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pete-buttigieg-says-biden-running-again-maybe-mistake","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/05/931/523/pete-buttigieg-cedar-rapids-ia-townhall-ropeline-may-13-2025-scaled.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-14 14:15:16","author":"Paul Steinhauser","authors":["Paul Steinhauser"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.238},{"id":321284704,"title":"CNN panel erupts after Kevin O'Leary calls Kamala Harris a 'loser'","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nMedia May 14, 2025 01:39 \n\n CNN panel erupts after Kevin O'Leary calls Kamala Harris a 'loser' \n Kevin O'Leary angered a CNN panel on Tuesday after he called former Vice President Kamala Harris a \"loser\" who was \"slaughtered\" in the 2024 election. \n Tags MEDIA","summary":"Kevin O&apos;Leary angered a CNN panel on Tuesday after he called former Vice President Kamala Harris a &quot;loser&quot; who was &quot;slaughtered&quot; in the 2024 election.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6372795063112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/f24d6a0b-f698-45c6-9878-7e3b6190f01d/126f0c2f-a0e1-48c2-aa98-20be46f8ca69/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-14 14:14:55","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.115},{"id":321254396,"title":"Biden couldn't recognize George Clooney last year, new book reveals","text":"A new book, Original Sin, written by Alex Thompson and Jake Tapper, has revealed a disturbing episode of former US President Joe Biden's apparent memory loss. The authors claim that during a Democratic fundraiser in Los Angeles on June 13, 2024, Biden failed to identify actor and co-host George Clooney. The episode allegedly left Clooney shaken to his core. The excerpt was published by The New Yorker on Tuesday. The authors detail a severely diminished Biden, then 81, arrived at the event with an aide. The aide had to remind Biden of Clooney's name, even though the two had known each other personally for nearly two decades. Clooney felt a knot form in his stomach as the president approached him, they wrote. Biden looked at him. 'Thank you for being here,' he said. 'Thank you for being here.' Then the aide said, You know George. Ex-President quickly said, Yeah, yeah, but still had no clue about Clooney, because he followed it up with Thank you for being here. When the aide quipped that it was the George Clooney in front of him, Biden responded: Oh, yeah...Hi, George! Clooney, who hadn't seen Biden since December 2022, was reportedly shocked at the president's rapid decline. Less than a month after the fundraiser, Clooney publicly took a shot at Biden in a New York Times op-ed. He said that Biden cannot win the election after his debate performance against Donald Trump on June 27, 2024. It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fundraiser was not the Joe 'big F-ing deal' Biden of 2010, Clooney wrote. We are not going to win in November with this president. Clooney's op-ed reportedly sparked an internal backlash within Biden's team. Biden adviser Steve Ricchetti was furious on reading the op-ed and allegedly threatened to shut Clooney down. Jeffrey Katzenberg, a movie producer who had asked Clooney to co-host the fundraiser, also objected to Clooney's criticism of Biden. Despite the backlash, Clooney stood by his words, stating, Aging was awful. It really wasn't fair. But...it's accurate. Ultimately, Biden dropped his re-election bid and advanced then-VP Kamala Harris as the Democrats' candidate.","summary":"A new book, Original Sin, written by Alex Thompson and Jake Tapper, has revealed a disturbing episode of former US President Joe Biden's apparent memory loss.","url":"https://www.newsbytesapp.com/news/entertainment/when-joe-biden-didnt-recognize-george-clooney/story","image":"https://i.cdn.newsbytesapp.com/images/l230_21301747223260.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-14 13:54:46","author":"Shreya Mukherjee","authors":["Shreya Mukherjee"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"sg","sentiment":-0.388},{"id":321271124,"title":"Ex-MAGA to Americans: Know who’s to blame for Trump’s corruption?

By re-electing Donald Trump, they’ve sent a message to the wheeling-and-dealing and most corrupt president the United States has ever seen:\n\n“We don’t care about the corruption. Line your pockets. Run self-enriching crypto schemes. Pilfer from the federal government for you and your cronies. Manipulate the markets. Tighten or loosen tariffs based on money piped into your bank accounts. Accept gaudy gifts — with likely strings attached — from corrupt foreign leaders. It’s all good.\"\n\nBecause, after all, Joe Biden is slow, and Kamala Harris is a Black woman. A faster-talking, lying white guy, no matter how corrupt, was the better choice, right? Even the Supreme Court thought so.\n\n\"Trump is openly corrupt and openly lawless,“ Walsh tweeted. ”Because he thinks he’s untouchable. He thinks he can get away with anything. And who can blame him for thinking this? The American people have told him he can get away with anything.\"\n\nIf Americans don’t see what’s happening, it’s because they don’t want to see. Or, as Walsh says, they just yawn because they’d “rather be entertained.” Or, they’re MAGA and it’s perfectly fine with them.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt has been endless mocked for lying that Trump is not out for himself, he’s working for America.\n\n“I think it’s frankly ridiculous that anyone in this room would even suggest that President Trump is doing anything for his own benefit,” she said last week. “He left a life of luxury and a life of running a very successful real estate empire for public service ... this is a president who has actually lost money for being president.”\n\nThe watchdog group, Citizens for Ethics connected the dots in a tweet:\n\n“1. Trump Org announces new development in Qatar\n\n2. Trump admin announces stop in Qatar as part of first foreign trip\n\n3. News breaks that Qatar plans to gift America a $400 million plane\n\nThis is all unprecedented and quite obviously corrupt.\"\n\nCoast-to-coast protests are still gaining momentum. But is this a sign that America is waking up to the dishonesty, deceipt and double-dealing — and is ready to reclaim the country? The answer is 18 months away.\n\nDonald Trump is who he has always been. He’d sell our most sensitive intelligence to our enemies if he could personally profit from it. The more disturbing part is how many people are willing to look away. Vanishingly few congressional Republicans have come forward to seriously question this obscene deal and demand transparency.\n\nOnce again, Trump is testing whether the rule of law still means something in this country—or whether our institutions are too paralyzed, partisan, or complicit to act. And again, we are failing miserably.\n\nWe deserve better. We deserve a President who works for the public interest—not for the highest bidder.

He’s “using tariffs to 1) get these other countries to drop their tariffs and/or 2) motivate American companies to move back to the United States and hire Americans.”\n\nBasically, on Liberation Day the president unplugged the American economy and then plugged it back in. He’s rebooting our economy at the expense of Wall Street to benefit a decimated working class.\nI’m not rich. I feel price hikes.

He simply will not step aside, and no one is able to compel him to step aside.\n\nIn an epoch of shattered norms, Fetterman’s refusal to resign is yet another instance of a public figure’s ruptured mentality. In 2023, George Santos, the newly elected Republican congressman from New York, refused to leave his post after revelations he had committed past felonies and fabricated the story of his life. He cheerfully made plans to run again in 2024. Biden’s insistence on remaining in the presidential race despite his clear mental decline followed; meanwhile, Donald Trump was raving on the campaign trail about Al Capone, even as he was seizing the political moment by defending an unglued Biden’s mental health (at the time he feared Kamala Harris’s candidacy). It recalled Chico Marx telling Groucho “there ain’t no sanity clause” as they haggled over a contract. It was, as people say, just like a movie, and it made Fetterman’s denial in the midst of his mental disintegration as inevitable as the next mind-exploding “announcement” from the White House.\n\nSixty years ago, the anti-psychiatry movement discredited the very notion of mental illness by vilifying psychiatry as a form of social control masquerading as science. Now a version of this thinking has migrated to the political realm. The line between sanity and insanity at the most elevated echelons of power has become barely discernible.\n\nPsychosis has been described as a safe, the combination to which has been lost. America’s two political parties have locked themselves away in hermetically sealed conspiracy theories. The left thinks social norms are a fabrication of power; the right thinks political norms are. Already verging on the psychotic, these ideological counterparts consider evidence of mental illness a mere glitch in personality when it occurs on their side, and a threat to the republic if it happens on the other.\n\nWhen Fetterman was a dyed-in-the-wool progressive, Republicans decried his tattoos as satanic. Now he has cosied up to Trump and Netanyahu – including by supporting Trump’s blocking of funds from Columbia University over its alleged anti-Semitism issues. There’s even talk of his leaving the Democrats to become an independent in his purple state. Republicans hail him as a hero who has overcome a stroke and clinical depression to stand up to his party. As for his erstwhile defenders, the Democrats, these days they think he needs professional help. “Every time I see him, I’m worried about him,” said one colleague in the Senate.\n\nOne fascinating feature of the rise of the American populist right is how it advocates a return to traditional values while making use of postmodern techniques promulgated at the elite universities they both love and loathe. Trump & Co’s vision of immutable gender roles, IQ-based beehive societies and racialist and nationalist hierarchies might be reflections of Trump’s disordered notion of the 19th century. But the conceptual means by which this traditionalist right is attempting to re-establish bygone American myths are right out of a Columbia seminar on poststructuralism: there are no facts, only narratives competing for power. (It’s not a coincidence that one of the new right’s favourite philosophers is Antonio Gramsci.) Such a premise makes for interesting dialogue in an academic setting. It is deranging in everyday life.\n\nFetterman seems to be, by every rational measure, unstable. But in a mad time, irrationality is difficult to define. The Trump administration claims the tattoos of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the El Salvadoran national it illegally deported to an El Salvadoran prison, prove his membership in the criminal Salvadoran-American gang MS-13. But the photos Trump posted on Truth Social to demonstrate his claim were clearly altered – yet only in the eyes of the Democratic opposition. In such an epistemological stand-off, you can hardly blame Fetterman if he thinks he lies squarely in the mainstream. If Trump can normalise criminality, why not open self-delusion to similar reform? How appropriate it is that the most popular new car colour in America now is called “battleship gray”: the colour of our enveloping cognitive fog, where Fettermans proliferate at the highest levels of government. In this general collapse of behavioural norms, of competing psyches with guns drawn, it’s no wonder the idea of steering a vessel of war through America’s byways exerts such a strong appeal.\n\n[See also: Modernity has killed the private life]","summary":"The line between sanity and insanity has become barely discernible.","url":"https://www.newstatesman.com/international-politics/2025/05/john-fetterman-and-the-death-of-american-shame","image":"https://dl6pgk4f88hky.cloudfront.net/2025/05/14/GettyImages-1251947196.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-14 13:14:55","author":"Lee Siegel","authors":["Lee Siegel"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.069},{"id":321418530,"title":"Jimmy Kimmel Urges Advertisers to Support ’60 Minutes’ Amid Trump Lawsuit","text":"Jimmy Kimmel reached across the aisle during Disney’s Upfront presentation in NYC on Tuesday (May 13) as he urged the advertisers in attendance to support CBS’ 60 Minutes.\n\nThe late-night host took to the stage at Tuesday’s event to share jokes and talk about the slate of programming on ABC and other Disney-owned properties. However, he ended his monologue by sharing support for 60 Minutes, a show belonging to rival network CBS.\n\n“I know it’s not part of our multi-platform, but support 60 Minutes. They deserve it,” Kimmel told the audience, per The Wrap, who reported that the mention of 60 Minutes was in Kimmel’s script and not ad-libbed.\n\nHe continued, “You have the power because you have the money. Support journalism. It’s important, and it doesn’t work without you.”\n\nKimmel’s comments come as President Donald Trump is suing CBS News for what he claims was biased reporting on 60 Minutes; specifically an interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris, which Trump alleges was edited in a way to mislead voters in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nEarlier this month, 60 Minutes host Scott Pelley told viewers live on air that the show’s longtime producer, Bill Owens, chose to depart after Paramount bosses supposedly asked the program to hold off on stories criticizing Trump.\n\nParamount Global, CBS’ parent company, is hoping to merge with Skydance Media, a deal that reportedly requires the green light from federal regulators under the Trump administration.\n\nElsewhere in Kimmel’s upfront monologue, he poked fun at Peyton Manning and Eli Manning, who had performed a musical number earlier in the day.\n\n“I do wanna thank the Manning brothers for finally answering the question, ‘What if two jars of mayonnaise could sing?'” Kimmel quipped. “The answer is: they can’t, and they shouldn’t. That was worse than what the Menendez brothers did.”\n\nAccording to Entertainment Weekly, the audience loudly groaned at Kimmel’s joking comparing the Manning brothers to convicted murderers Lyle and Erik Menendez. “Too soon or too late?” he asked in response to the reaction.\n\nThe Jimmy Kimmel Live! host also took shots at rival networks, joking about NBC’s upcoming 100th birthday, “It’s finally old enough to watch CBS.”\n\nHe also bragged about Disney having 164 million active users per month across Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, noting that’s “more than twice the number Netflix has… I don’t have a joke for that. I just want you know we finally beat those motherf****** at something!”\n\nKimmel also mentioned CBS’ hit comedy Ghosts, joking, “Which is also what most of their viewers will be soon,” and touched on Fox’s upcoming Memory of a Killer, a show about a hitman with Alzheimer’s.\n\n“That is a dumb idea, but at least CBS and Fox are making shows,” the comedian said before mocking his own network. “ABC, we ordered one new show, and it’s a spinoff of an old show, which really begs the question, what are we doing here? We risked our lives flying into Newark for this.”\n\nHe added,” If you went to a restaurant, and the waiter said, ‘Our special tonight is last year’s fish,’ would you eat it? No, you would not. Our fish is not fresh.”\n\nHowever, he did praise on particular ABC show, saying, “You know what? We do have Season grandmotherf****** 2 of The Golden Bachelor. Say what you will about ABC, we are still the only network where you can see Pop-Pop get a squeezer in a hot tub.”\n\nMore Headlines:\n\nRoush Review: Strap in for ‘Duster,’ a Joyride of Hot Wheels and MayhemGypsy-Rose Blanchard Breaks Down as She Addresses Telling Daughter About Mom’s MurderJimmy Kimmel Urges Advertisers to Support ’60 Minutes’ Amid Trump LawsuitSavannah Chrisley Gets Candid About Parents’ Prison Release & What’s Next‘The Voice’ Season 27 Finalists Revealed – Who’s In & Who’s Out?","summary":"Late night host spoke out at Disney Upfront event.","url":"https://www.guampdn.com/lifestyle/entertainment/jimmy-kimmel-urges-advertisers-to-support-60-minutes-amid-trump-lawsuit/article_9a4ad378-be2a-5c27-82c9-9f85ec0eb52f.html","image":"https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/guampdn.com/content/tncms/custom/image/d1d0565a-bcb2-11eb-8535-ab06d41ce483.jpg?resize=600%2C315","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-14 12:25:26","author":"Martin Holmes,TV Insider","authors":["Martin Holmes","TV Insider"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gu","sentiment":-0.311},{"id":321230190,"title":"There Are No Rigged Elections in America... Except at DNC","text":"Who could've seen it coming?\n\nJust 101 days into his tenure as the Democratic Party's youngest vice chair \u0013 and the first \"Zoomer\" to hold that office \u0013 party elites have already declared David Hogg's election null and void, a complaint that sounds suspiciously like \"election fraud.\" It's the latest embarrassment from a spent political party that pales in comparison to President Trump's incredibly successful first 100 days. If Republicans are wise, they'll take advantage of the chaos ahead of the 2026 midterms.\n\nThe complaint centers on broken parliamentary procedures \u0013 the preferred excuse of weasels and dictators alike to undermine democratic elections \u0013 specifically, DNC rules mandating \"gender parity\" to tip the scales in favor of female candidates running against men.\n\nIn other words, DEI did Hogg in.\n\nHogg, who was elected to help Democrats win back young male voters, complained that \"the DNC has pledged to remove me, and this vote has provided an avenue to fast-track that effort.\" Party elites, he believes, want to \"defend an indefensible status quo.\"\n\nThe DNC's procedural revelation comes just two days after Hogg blasted his party for driving away young men who \"feel like they have to walk on eggshells & constantly because they're going to be judged or ostracized or excommunicated.\"\n\nOh, the irony. More importantly, will conservatives capitalize on the blunder?\n\nFor years, Democrat politicians have told Americans that elections couldn't be more trustworthy, that only they could safeguard democracy from MAGA Republicans, and that their party represents everyday people over ultra-wealthy special interests.\n\nNone of that is true, as this latest CCP-style election nullification reminds us.\n\nDemocrats routinely meddle with their internal elections to manufacture \"victories\" for party insiders, voters be damned. Remember the superdelegates in 2016 and 2020? Bernie Sanders sure does \u0013 the \"oligarchs and billionaires\" he complains about cost him the Democratic nomination twice by rigging obscure parliamentary rules against him.\n\nCongressional Democrats haven't accepted a Republican presidential victory as legitimate since 1988. House Democrats tried to nullify Republican election victories in 2016 and 2024 as illegitimate, yet called allegations of a stolen election in the extremely questionable COVID election results in 2020 \"misinformation.\"\n\nAs for protecting democracy, leftists tried to turn 2024 into a one-party election in many states by removing Donald Trump from the ballot. That was an inside job by D.C. operatives to thwart the will of voters, who delivered Trump a landslide victory anyway.\n\nDon't forget Democrats' effort to nullify the Constitution with a \"national popular vote\" scheme to award all Electoral College votes to whichever candidate wins the most popular votes nationwide. In 2016, that would've meant awarding all 538 electoral votes to Hillary Clinton \u0013 even in states she lost or didn't bother to visit, like Wisconsin.\n\nAmazingly, Democrats suddenly went mute about the national popular vote after November 2024, with Michigan Democrats quietly abandoning their national popular vote bill mere weeks after Trump won a popular vote majority.\n\nThis from a party controlled by a small constellation of ultra-partisan activists, agitators, lobbyists, and political operatives in the Beltway. Recall that Kamala Harris never won a primary vote anywhere \u0013 not in two presidential elections.\n\nMassive dark money donors with strong ties to Big Business and Wall Street magnates bankrolled Harris' campaign from the start. Even in California, she was the ultimate product of one-party machine politics: a mediocre prosecutor who failed upward at every turn by collecting enough party IOUs to earn a political promotion. Her promise was to govern as a figurehead for the faceless Deep State cabal that the Left no longer tries to hide.\n\nIt was only after Harris came into contact with real, flesh-and-blood Americans in places like \u0013 shudder \u0013 Nevada and Pennsylvania that she fell to pieces. Normal people, it turns out, don't consider mindless babbling and cackling substitutes for ideas and leadership.\n\nNow those same special interests are behind the second Trump \"Resistance\" to undermine the agenda most voters voted for.\n\nThere's a common thread here: Democratic politicians and their allies attack the system as \"rigged\" and \"unfair\" when they lose. They're champions of the system until the system doesn't work for them, even a single time; then they reveal themselves for the lying opportunists they've been all along. Hogg, for all his inanity and gun control bona fides, was honest enough to criticize his party's toxic obeisance to the radical feminists and trans nazis who've made the world's oldest political party repulsive to young men (and most everyone else).\n\nHogg just proved that democracy cannot be tolerated in the Democratic Party. Dissent will be crushed with extreme prejudice. He'll shortly be replaced by a gay black woman who pledges to enforce the party line, no questions asked.\n\nRepublicans should thank God for this gift. We have an opportunity to further expose and permanently defeat the woke mob while it's distracted by infighting, but that window is quickly closing. If this is how the Democratic Party treats its own \"democracy,\" America, how will it treat yours?","summary":"","url":"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2025/05/14/there_are_no_rigged_elections_in_america_except_at_dnc_152785.html","image":"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/asset/img/social_media_assets/site_logos/rcp.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-14 11:49:56","author":"Hayden Ludwig,RCP","authors":["Hayden Ludwig","RCP"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.113},{"id":321242850,"title":"John Ewing Jr. wins Omaha election; becomes city's first Black mayor","text":"May 14 (UPI) -- Democrat John Ewing Jr. defeated incumbent Republican Omaha Mayor Jean Stothert to become Omaha's first Black mayor.\n\nEwing, a former Omaha deputy police chief and current Douglas County, Neb., treasurer, defeated Stothert by an unofficial margin of 48,693 to 37,758, as reported by the Douglas County Election Commission.

Then All Hell Broke Loose","text":"The chaos breaking out in the Democratic Party over the now-disputed election of a young activist to its upper ranks has reignited old debates about its recent past and new ones about its uncertain future.On Tuesday, a credentials body within the Democratic National Committee (DNC) voted to void the February election which elevated the young activist David Hogg to one of the party's five vice chair positions. The full body of the DNC is set to weigh in later this year, and could force Hogg and a second vice chair, Malcolm Kenyatta, to run again.Hogg, the Parkland high school shooting survivor now turned figurehead for the new Democratic wave, acknowledged that the DNC's decision was due to procedural discrepancies in the election. However, he said it was \"impossible to ignore\" the broader context of his calls and efforts to reinvent the party.The vote followed around three hours of debate, according to the New York Times, but the wider backdrop was a monthslong dispute between the party's top brass and younger voices over its future—a rift that dates back to the election of President Donald Trump in November.Postelection PostmortemsMany postmortems of Kamala Harris' campaign cited its failure to distance the nominee from Joe Biden's presidency and articulate an alternative route forward. Despite Republicans now holding the Oval Office and Congress, Democrats have struggled to gain the political advantage typically afforded to an opposition party, despite it facing an incumbent whose popularity is shaky.\"The hangover from inflation, immigration, and Biden's stubborn refusal to run again, has poisoned public opinion about the Democrats, at least for now,\" said political analyst Larry Sabato. \"Add to that the simple fact that Democrats control nothing that matters—White House, Senate, House, Supreme Court.\"\"All Democrats can do is make noise, and even that loses its effect after a while.\"According to YouGov's most recent polling, Democrats' favorability stands at 37.1 percent, compared to the 59.3 percent who view them unfavorably. Surveys from Fox News, NBC and CNN have all revealed a similar result: That Americans' trust in the party in the second age of Trump stands at near, if not all-time historic lows.Political scientist Daniel Hopkins told Newsweek that Democrats are now struggling with the \"different, in some ways contradictory tasks\" of aligning their more activist voters who want the party to take a stronger anti-Trump stance, while also rebuilding their brand with discontented moderates.As in the immediate aftermath of the presidential election, headlines are once again lamenting the party's loss of male voters, blue-collar workers, and its way, and declaring Democrats unfit for fulfilling their contemporary purpose: reclaiming the House, the Senate and, in 2028, the presidency.David Hogg Into the SpotlightInto these discussions has stormed the 25-year-old Hogg, who has positioned himself as the man capable of steering the Democrats back on course using lessons learned from their recent losses.Hogg has criticized his own party for what he views as an alienating stance toward men, and cited the perceived obsession with cultural issues as a major factor in the Republicans' 2024 victories.\"What I think happened last election is younger men—they would rather vote for somebody who they don't completely agree with, they don't feel judged by, than somebody who they do agree with, that they feel like they have to walk on eggshells around,\" Hogg said during a recent appearance on Real Time with Bill Maher.Hogg was again thrust into the center of this internal debate after his election to vice chair was deemed to have violated DNC bylaws which encourage gender parity among the party leadership. DNC member Kalyn Free, who lost to Hogg in February and brought the challenge against his victory, said that the committee improperly tallied votes and failed \"to distinguish between gender categories in a meaningful way.\" In doing so, she argued, it \"violated its own charter and bylaws, undermining both fairness and gender diversity.\"To some, this seemed like irony—the party voiding Hogg's election based on gender-based requirements, after he had criticized it for an overt focus on gender issues. To Hogg it also sniffed of retribution for his wider attempt to recalibrate the Democrats' focus and party makeup.\"Obviously I would prefer that I not be removed,\" Hogg told Newsweek in a recent interview. \"However, in the case that I am, I'm still going to fight to build the strongest Democratic Party possible.\"Hogg has been vocal in his criticism of \"ineffective Democrats,\" who he says have been \"asleep at the wheel\" and failed to mount an effective challenge to Trump's presidency. In April, Hogg announced that he would be launching a $20-million effort to oust \"out-of-touch\" Democrats in historically purple and blue Congressional seats with younger, progressive candidates through Leaders We Deserve, the political action committee he co-founded in 2023.\"It's not to say it's out with the old and in with the new. I would say it's more accurate to say it's out with the ineffective and in with the effective,\" Hogg said in an interview with The Washington Post.Riling the Democratic Old GuardThe threat to primary even safe-seat Democrats has drawn criticism from the old guard of the party—veteran strategist James Carville calling him a \"contemptible little twerp\"—as well as DNC Chair Ken Martin.\"If you want to challenge incumbents, you're more than free to do that, but just not as an officer of the DNC, because our job is to be neutral arbiters,\" said Martin on a call with reporters in April. \"We can't be both the referee and also the player at the same time. You have to make a decision.\"\"He's trying to be a Democratic Party official and break the rules of being a Democratic Party official,\" said Theda Skocpol, a professor of government and sociology at Harvard University. \"I'm a little bit puzzled at that. I don't see why he can't just lead his effort to elect new people without being vice chair of the Democratic Party.\"\"Hogg is young and vocal, and thinks more leaders should be young and vocal,\" Peter Loge, former senior adviser to Barack Obama, told Newsweek. \"Others in the Democratic Party are older and quieter and think more leaders should be older and quieter.\"However, both agreed that the Democrats' success in 2026 and beyond will not be dictated by the current rift between Hogg and the party's institutional leadership—which Skocpol described as an \"internal sideshow battle\" and Loge dubbed \"inside gossip in a sport almost no one cares about.\"Just as Republican's victory stemmed—at least in part—from opposition to aspects of Biden's presidency, what will unfold electorally over the next few years may depend more heavily on the actions of the incumbent administration.Though Hogg himself has said that Democrats need more cohesive strategy than simply being \"the party that is against Donald Trump,\" Skocpol told Newsweek that the lack of \"some grand Democratic Party vision\" will be less relevant than voters' assessments of whether their lives have gotten better or worse under the president.For now, though, the Democratic Party is caught in a public showdown between its past failure—and older members—and the younger figures hoping to define its future direction. David Hogg, whether inside the DNC or out, is intent on shaping that definition.","summary":"David Hogg's disputed DNC vice chair victory has reignited debates over the party's direction in the Trump-era political landscape.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/democrats-dnc-election-david-hogg-2072004","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2643757/democrats-fumbled-their-own-election.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-14 11:04:33","author":"Hugh Cameron","authors":["Hugh Cameron"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.021},{"id":321209022,"title":"Mobile McDonald’s rolled out for Trump in the Gulf","text":"Credit: X/@Mike_Wagenheim\n\nSaudi Arabia rolled out a mobile McDonald’s for Donald Trump’s arrival in Riyadh on Tuesday.\n\nMordechai Wagenheim, a correspondent at i24NEWS, posted footage of the McDonald’s truck, which was specifically designed for the US president’s visit to Saudi Arabia, the first major foreign trip of his second term.\n\nMr Trump is well-known for his love of McDonald’s, particularly Big Macs and a Fillet-O-Fish, according to Jared Kushner, his son-in-law.\n\nThe US president even worked in a McDonald’s – briefly – during a publicity stunt for last November’s election in response to Kamala Harris claiming she worked at the fast food restaurant as a college student.\n\nThe mobile McDonald’s was added onto the back of a truck as he arrived in Riyadh to much fanfare.\n\nMr Trump was greeted personally by the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and horses with riders waving US and Saudi flags.\n\nThe US president later looked unsure as he was handed what appeared to be a coffee in a small espresso cup by attendants wearing ceremonial gun-belts.\n\nCredit: Reuters\n\nHe was later filmed sipping on the coffee as he leaned back in his chair next to the Saudi Crown Prince and Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, who immediately drank the drink.

If the DNC approves the vote, then Hogg, Kenyatta, Free, Jeanna Repass, and Shasti Conrad are all eligible to run again for the two remaining vice chair positions. \n\nSome Democrats alleged that the procedural maneuver to hold a new election is being used to force out Hogg, who has angered many Democrats after announcing he would spend $20 million on Democratic primaries to elect younger politicians through his group Leaders We Deserve. \n\nDAVID HOGG SAYS DNC IN PROCESS OF REMOVING HIM AS VICE CHAIRMAN\n\n“It looks bad,” Democratic strategist Brad Bannon told the Washington Examiner. “It looks like they’re trying to silence, you know, go through the back door just to silence a critic. So I’m opposed to this latest maneuver.”\n\nOne House Democrat, granted anonymity to speak freely about leadership, told the Washington Examiner that pushing out Hogg, 25, from leadership is not a good look for the party. \n\n“The purging of — coming up with an excuse to get rid of a couple of people who kind of rock the boat, I don’t think that that’s a good thing [and] conversation for us to be having right now,” the lawmaker said.\n\nHowever, a DNC member, granted anonymity to speak freely about his support of ousting Hogg, slammed the vice chairman’s $20 million effort to back primary challenges as a “self-serving political grift.”\n\n“Just the idea that he’s using his position to organize primaries against Democrats when we’ve got to keep our focus on winning back the House, it’s the height of a self-serving hustle,” the member said.\n\nHogg defended himself in a lengthy post Monday evening, claiming he is hoping to remake the party after a bruising November election that saw many key constituents move away from Democrats.\n\n“Today, the DNC took its first steps to remove me from my position as Vice Chair At-Large,” Hogg said in a statement. “While this vote was based on how the DNC conducted its officers’ elections, which I had nothing to do with, it is also impossible to ignore the broader context of my work to reform the party which loomed large over this vote.”\n\nBut Hogg’s defense has not placated his fellow vice chairman, who is also at risk of running again for reelection.\n\nKenyatta said he was “frustrated” and claimed the drama over a new election was not about Hogg, “even though he clearly wants it to be.” \n\nIn a separate Instagram post, Kenyatta turned to expletives to express his anger. \n\nHogg’s behavior “rubs me the wrong way,” Kenyatta said. “Not just because I got way more votes than him, and I also am finding myself in this position of having to go through another election, which was hard and grueling on my team and on my family.”\n\nThe Democratic Party is still struggling to find the best path forward to win back voters who chose President Donald Trump over former Vice President Kamala Harris. Younger Democrats are increasingly running against older Democrats who have been in office for decades, claiming the party needs a new generation of leaders, with the internal debate often spilling over into the public arena.\n\n“I’ve done the hard and unglamorous work of trying to build this party and rebuild this party in a moment where we really need to f***ing change what we’re doing in the way that we’re approaching voters,” said the 34-year-old Kenyatta. “And yet we’ve spent now weeks talking about one person, not about what the party needs to do, but talking about one person.”\n\nRep. Mark Pocan (D-WI) posted similar sentiments that Hogg’s battle with the DNC is a “distraction.” \n\n“The @DNC will prove itself to be irrelevant as a political organization if they punish duly elected leaders like @davidhogg111 because they disagree with him,” Pocan wrote on X. “I hope they put more thought into any decision. We need to be fighting the reconciliation bill. This is a distraction.” \n\nOne House Democrat told the Washington Examiner that it’s fine for political leaders to challenge incumbents, but the member questioned the timing of Hogg’s plan as “suspect.”\n\n“If he had been elected four years ago or three years ago to be a vice chair, and circumstances have changed, and he decided to do this, that would even be one thing,” the lawmaker said. “But to do it in such quick succession, it’s hard to believe that he didn’t know that he was going to pursue an anti-incumbent primary strategy while he was running for DNC Vice Chair.”\n\n“He should have been open and upfront about that,” the lawmaker added.\n\nHowever, the lawmaker also added that kicking Hogg out as the vice chairman because of his primary planning is not a good look for the party. \n\n“It only would feed a narrative that is unhelpful to the DNC and unhelpful to the party in this moment,” the lawmaker said.\n\nFree’s challenge alleging that the vice chair elections did not follow proper procedure was brought forth on Feb. 28, before Hogg announced the $20 million investment in mid-April. But the optics of the resolution have landed the party in a political bind. \n\nDNC leaders have attempted to take a more neutral tone on the fallout from Free’s challenge and tamp down attacks against Hogg. \n\nChristine Pelosi, a member of the credentials committee and daughter of former Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), explained that after Artie Blanco was elected as the first vice chairwoman in February, the next vice chair needed to be a man due to gender parity rules, and the third could be of any gender.\n\n“The DNC Members voted for those last two spots on a combined ballot,” Pelosi wrote on X. “After the election, one of the Vice Chair candidates, Kalyn Free, raised a challenge that combining those last two ballots violated the rules of procedure for the vote.” \n\nDNC Chairman Ken Martin also struck a measured response in a statement released after the resolution passed. \n\n“I am disappointed to learn that before I became Chair, there was a procedural error in the February Vice Chair elections,” Martin said. “The Credentials Committee has issued their recommendation, and I trust that the DNC Members will carefully review the Committee’s resolution and resolve this matter fairly. I thank all of our officers for their service, including Vice Chairs Kenyatta and Hogg, and look forward to continuing to work with them in their officer posts as this matter is resolved.”\n\nDEMOCRATS FACE A RECKONING OVER SENIORITY AS YOUNG MEMBERS CLAW FOR CHANGE\n\nMartin previously claimed that DNC leaders should not meddle in primary races and pushed for a neutrality pledge that will likely be taken up during the August meeting. Hogg has not agreed to the pledge, but if it is adopted, that would likely be another maneuver to remove him from office, which Democrats appeared to accept more than holding new elections. \n\n“I believe Martin’s initial proposal is the correct one. Hogg should make a choice,” Bannon said. “He wants to continue this project, he should resign. But I don’t like this backdoor way of trying to bump him out of his job.”\n\n“I think they’re doing too much,” said Sharonda Huffman, a former 2024 DNC delegate and Baltimore County council candidate in Maryland, of the neutrality pledge. “They’re trying to make a point for everybody, for one person. And I think that might be too much.” \n\n“Personally, I welcome David Hogg to be part of the Democratic Party. I think his voice is needed. I think his experience is needed,” Michael Ceraso, a Democratic strategist with experience working on presidential campaigns, told the Washington Examiner. \n\nBut Ceraso also claimed that if Hogg doesn’t feel accepted within the DNC, then he should consider “building out your own entity and infrastructure, and let the DNC operate, and arguably, find a replacement for you of someone who wants to be there.”\n\nAt least one DNC member said they hadn’t received any guidance from the DNC on when they’d vote on whether to redo the vice chair elections. Current DNC laws don’t allow the organization to easily oust Hogg if he doesn’t willingly step down, but the DNC member mentioned that even without the technicality, the DNC could always change the bylaws to boot Hogg in August.\n\nHogg has repeatedly thumbed his nose at Democrats who he claims are too enamored by seniority and tradition as opposed to the urgent fight against Trump.\n\n“Our country is in crisis, and too many leaders in the Democratic Party are asleep at the wheel,” he said in his Monday evening statement. “I ran to be DNC Vice Chair to help make the Democratic Party better, not to defend an indefensible status quo that has caused voters in almost every demographic group to move away from us.” \n\nHuffman, the former DNC delegate, was not opposed to Democratic incumbents facing challengers. \n\n“It’s nothing wrong with competition,” she said. “People are dying in office. Of course, natural causes happen, but we are not allowing a new generation of leaders to come. Sometimes we are ineffective and we’re not facing a reality that some people need to just step down. I believe in term limits.” \n\nCongressional leaders have mostly deferred to the DNC to handle the vice chair elections, with some declining to comment when asked by the Washington Examiner or dodging the question.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) did not go into the drama of possibly removing Hogg from his DNC position during a Tuesday press conference when asked, yet he did offer some insight on where he stands. \n\n“I think I’ve been very clear about my perspective on David Hogg, and I’m going to defend every single member of the United States House of Representatives in the Democratic caucus,” Jeffries said. \n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) offered few words on the Hogg crisis: “Up to the DNC.”\n\nBut ultimately, several Democrats are pushing the party to refocus on pushing back against the Trump administration and move away from the Hogg drama. “At some point, folks need to stop having main character energy,” Ceraso said. \n\nRamsey Touchberry and Marisa Schultz contributed to this report.","summary":"The Democratic National Committee&#8216;s possible removal of Vice Chairman David Hogg has ignited an internal firestorm, splitting party members over what some say is a sham attempt to quash a young leader.

The mere task of purchasing a grocery store staple became a political flashpoint during last year&apos;s election. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) released its consumer price index report for April on Tuesday, showing egg prices declined by 12.7% when compared with the prior month. That followed monthly increases of 10.4% in February and 5.9% in March. The last decline in egg prices was recorded in October. BLS data showed the average price of a dozen grade A large eggs was about $5.12 in April, down from nearly $6.23 in March and $5.90 in February. April&apos;s prices were the lowest since January, when they averaged $4.95 a dozen, which was the last time they were under $5. Prices remain well above where they were last April, when BLS data showed they were about $2.86 a dozen. The ongoing avian flu outbreak began in 2022, and in 2023, the Animal and Plant Health Information Service within the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) declared it to be the \"largest and longest outbreak in the history of the United States.\" INFLATION TICKED SLIGHTLY HIGHER IN APRIL AS TARIFF IMPACT LOOMS The H5N1 avian flu has affected 168 million birds around the country. Due to the highly contagious nature of the virus, flocks are often euthanized in their entirety once the virus is detected. BLS data shows that in 2021, before the outbreak began, the average price of grade A large eggs was under $1.80 per dozen throughout the year. Egg prices surged to $4.82 a dozen by January 2023 before declining to near $2, then gradually rising in 2024 and early 2025 until the latest peak in March. TRUMP ADMINISTRATION UNVEILS KEY STRATEGY TO &apos;IMMEDIATELY&apos; BRING DOWN RECORD-HIGH EGG PRICES The rise in egg prices occurred amid the backdrop of overall inflation hitting a 40-year high in 2022. That made the issue a focal point of the 2024 presidential election, with President Donald Trump criticizing then-President Joe Biden and Democrat presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris over their handling of the outbreak. After Trump&apos;s election victory, his administration rolled out a plan to fight high egg prices that was led by Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins. She signaled that the U.S. would look to import eggs in the short term to help boost supply as domestic egg producers dealt with the effects of the outbreak. The plan also involved deregulation, biosecurity investments, repopulating fowl and investing in vaccines and therapeutic research. A report by the USDA that was released on Friday showed that imports of eggs and liquid egg products have risen to help mitigate the domestic shortage and price increases, which have in turn boosted inventories. TRUMP&apos;S SPEECH PUMPS INFLATION FIGHT FROM EGGS TO ENERGY \"Overall imports of shell and egg products rose 3 percent in March with an 18 percent increase in value driven by efforts to supplement shell and egg products in the domestic market due to reduced production resulting from persistent outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza in the first two months of the year,\" the USDA wrote. \"Imports of table shell eggs increased 257 percent as with two additional nations, Brazil and Honduras, shipping shell eggs to the U.S. in addition to Turkey and Mexico,\" the report noted. \"Imports of liquid egg products increased 11 percent for the month; 32 percent over year ago levels as both China and Thailand more than doubled their volumes from the prior month. Imports of liquid yolk increased 29 percent as Canada increased their shipments.\" GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE Despite those efforts, the USDA report noted that egg prices remain at relatively high levels for consumers compared with historical trends. \"Price levels to the consumer have eased considerably from early-year highs but remain at levels not yet conducive to more than normal purchases needs as consumers are slow to adjust to what may be the new near-term norm,\" the agency wrote.

Subscribe here.\n\nBy Chris Whipple\n\nHarper Influence\n\nBy Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes\n\nWilliam Morrow\n\nKamala Harris was poised to win the 2024 presidential election when her message included America getting control of its border and her championing economic and political change.\n\nIn her campaign launch addressing the economy and in her DNC acceptance speeches, she made the cost of living singularly important, showed empathy, and offered concrete policy solutions. She promised that Congress would enact the bipartisan border control bill. She embraced President Biden’s expanded Child Tax Credit and attacked Donald Trump’s tax cuts for billionaires. Her speeches made the election a battle for the middle class. She was laser-focused on the cost of living, while portraying—correctly, as we are seeing today—Trump tariffs as an inflationary tax on imports. She made that the principal fight of the campaign.\n\nAnd after her debate against Trump, Harris moved into a three-point lead nationally and, critically, ahead in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania.\n\nBut it was not to be.\n\nTwo books, one by Chris Whipple, Uncharted: How Trump Beat Biden, Harris, and the Odds in the Wildest Campaign in History, and the other by Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes, Fight: Inside the Wildest Battle for the White House, show the disastrous decisions that put Donald Trump in the White House. I will also describe my efforts with various participants to impact those decisions.\n\nYou need to read both these important books to understand the 2024 election. Harris could have won, but her campaign had so many 180-degree turns and was so burdened by Joe Biden’s continued presence in the campaign that she lost. The lessons for Democrats are painful.\n\nAllen and Parnes had strong access to the managers and campaign operations for both Biden and Harris, making the book indispensable to understanding the campaign’s many turns. Harris kept on Biden’s campaign manager Jennifer O’Malley Dillon. That fateful decision contributed mightily to the disaster.\n\nBut Whipple’s will be the more important book because it had better access to the advisers closest to Biden, understands the implications of changes in message and strategy for the election, and effectively uses other research to tell a fuller picture.\n\nThe further I read in these books, the angrier I grew with the Biden advisers who failed to act as his senescence accelerated, while Biden’s deep personal insecurity and paranoia produced a preposterous campaign based on his accomplishments, in what was really a change election. I was also maddened by the apparent sexism of the Biden team that assumed his vice president could not win the presidency, disastrously delaying his exit from the race.\n\nNow, 2024 was a tough year for incumbent parties all over the world. The highest inflation in 40 years rated 20 or 30 points above the next problem in polls. All saw surges in refugees and illegal immigration. Conservatives successfully whipped up a frenzy about the elite’s “woke” liberal policies.\n\nThey were all sinking Biden. James Carville and I still speak every morning, and we were depressed, certain Biden would lose. James went on every show to vent. Despite the daunting problems, both books portray Biden—as well as Trump—as men with few doubts. And the advisers and managers are depicted as “loyalists” helping the leaders achieve their goals. In particular, Ron Klain was depicted in both books as the adviser fighting the hardest and longest to keep the president in the race.\n\nBut that does not capture the reality of doubts, fractures, and debates that I saw personally. I sent regular emails to the White House and the Biden campaign, including Anita Dunn, Ron Klain, Mike Donilon, Steve Ricchetti, John Anzalone, and later, Ted Kaufman and Chris Dodd. After Biden withdrew, I wrote to David Binder, Harris’s chief pollster, and later, Lorraine Voles, Harris’s chief of staff.\n\nAs chief of staff early in Biden’s term, Klain pushed for economic messages that empathized with voters’ pain and promised to help lower prices. He tried to reverse the changes in immigration policies that were producing millions of new border encounters. He was not alone. And he too felt that President Biden’s legacy could be best achieved by him not running for re-election.\n\nBy late 2023, two-thirds of the country thought we were on the wrong track, so before Thanksgiving I wrote a report named “The Change Campaign That Can Contest America.” Klain wrote, “I agree with this 100% and have been pressing an argument similar to this with Jeff [Zients] and Mike [Donilon].” Feel “their pain and stand for change.” But “they are not there. You have to move Mike considerably.”\n\nAfter watching President Biden praise the economy for two years straight, I responded ironically. How is it going? “You have conducted an experiment—speaking positively about the economy for two years. Your overall approval rating has only declined every month.” Klain agreed but added, “In 2020, Biden was a change candidate. But today, he is the incumbent preaching stability. And a lot of black people in our country want to shake things up.”\n\nThe Biden media firm ran ads on how the Inflation Reduction Act saved you money and raised taxes on big corporations. It got strong positive reactions from voters. But I also tested Biden declaring, “We are now living through the strongest—fastest—most widespread and equitable recovery in American history.” It brought Biden’s approval rating down further.\n\nFinally, in December that year, I wrote a letter to share with the president, saying Biden has a historic domestic legacy and could have an international one as well. Trump will be difficult to beat, and “his sole mission will be the destruction of your legacy.”\n\nKlain responded, “This has been my view for almost a year, but Michael [Donilon] sees it differently.” Who else in the team felt that Biden should retire? Maybe most.\n\nIn February 2024, President Biden’s campaign organized a session at the Democratic House members’ retreat to discuss their election plans. The campaign put sheets listing “Biden’s Top Ten Accomplishments” on all the tables.\n\nUsually, the president loved these meetings with members where he went back and forth on policy and politics, ran late, and did a rope line. But this year, the president took only three softball planted questions, and he answered from a prepared text.\n\nWhat comes through powerfully in these books is a Joe Biden who is extremely personally insecure and constantly looking for evidence of his success and approval. Accordingly, he blocks out negative information, and therefore ended up out of touch with public perceptions in 2024.\n\nAs a result, his advisers could not give the honest reason for why he should not have run: He was one of the most unpopular presidents in history; he would certainly lose and take many of his Democratic friends with him. Instead, they pointed fingers, saying Biden had a “path to victory,” but not with a disunited party and so many major leaders saying he should drop out.\n\nThat in turn bred an atmosphere of paranoia, and an enemies-list dynamic where critics were booed in campaign offices. It led the president to feel frustrated and unappreciated, wanting to defend himself in public and demanding Harris speak positively of their shared accomplishments. He freely interrupted White House press briefings to talk about good economic news. Biden also wanted to exact retribution for those not loyal, particularly former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and President Barack Obama. They were not viewed as patriots.\n\nIn reading the books, I wondered what the Obama advisers who had joined the Harris campaign were doing.\n\nAllen and Parnes’s Fight depends heavily on reports by the Biden managers that treat that side of Biden as normal, while Whipple focuses more on Biden’s aging and ability to do the job.\n\nBut I was shocked at Whipple’s account of the debate with Trump—the moment that connected all the dots for many people in the country. President Obama and George Clooney had seen Biden’s aging at a star-studded Los Angeles fundraiser in mid-June, but the debate two weeks later moved them to act.\n\nWhat I learned is that the Atlanta debate was better than Biden’s debate prep at Camp David two days before. Whipple writes that Klain “was struck by how exhausted he was—and out of touch with his own campaign.” Klain had 3×5 cards with his economic agenda for the second term, but Biden “wanted to talk about how much foreign leaders loved him.” Whipple reports that the president “was fatigued, befuddled, and disengaged.”\n\nWhy after Atlanta did the Biden team not stop and conclude there was no way for Joe Biden to wage this campaign against Trump or to serve a second term? What’s more, why weren’t they preparing Vice President Harris to be a stronger candidate?\n\nAllen and Parnes report that “Biden’s team had inflicted serious reputational damage to Harris with Democratic insiders. [It] played on her reputation to help save him.” The Biden campaign conducted its own polls on Harris against Trump and shared them in all their conversations. They created a conventional wisdom that “Harris polls worse than Biden.” They were exploiting the sexism among politicians and voters, and perhaps their own. So, when I began sending my daily emails to the Biden team, I pushed every day against their conventional wisdom. Since the debate, Harris was running two points on average stronger than the president. Their own poll from an affiliated Biden group had her doing three points better. I wrote that Harris’s unfavorable rating was then five points lower than the president’s.\n\nI also wrote that she would gain quickly from consolidated base voters and the Democratic convention. I inserted a graph showing that Al Gore had started nine points down before his convention and came out tied days after it closed.\n\nI now doubt that the team was presenting Biden graphs showing Harris running stronger than Biden.\n\nBiden did grudgingly drop out—but not until July 21st. The short remaining time led Harris to keep Biden’s campaign largely intact. Before her debate with Trump, he called her and insisted there be “No daylight, kid.”\n\nBiden felt Harris had underutilized him and did everything possible to be part of the story at the close. That led him to join a campaign call during Harris’s closing speech on the Ellipse to observe that “the only garbage I see floating there is his supporters.” Using actual garbage trucks, Trump was able to fuse Biden and Harris and tie them to Hillary Clinton calling Trump voters “deplorables.”\n\nJennifer O’Malley Dillon and Wilmington\n\nJennifer O’Malley Dillon was a strong manager who had built a staff of passionate people who loved Joe Biden. She had built a campaign prepared to direct a billion dollars, as well as field offices and organizers across the country. Then Biden withdrew days before the convention and with only 107 days left before the election.\n\nHarris’s prior campaigns and offices had staff issues and departures, and she was worried about “drama” during the transition. With a wink from Harris’s aides, EMILY’s List had prepared a campaign plan, and as I confirmed, its president Stephanie Schriock was ready to be manager.\n\nBut likely because time was so short, Harris told O’Malley Dillon and her staff to stay on, though probably not with everyone staying in their prior roles. Schriock was told, “No thank you.”\n\nThat meant they never sat down at the beginning and faced the biggest strategic issue of the campaign: How will you differ from Joe Biden? That produced the near-fatal interview with The View, in which Harris refused to identify any such changes.\n\nThe campaign wrote an economic speech saying, “As president of the United States, it will be my intention to build on the foundation of this progress,” making it easier to brand Harris with “Bidenomics.”\n\nAs I saw, the Biden staff didn’t mind her sliding away from the “cost of living.” Biden would not utter the words because he thought it was criticism of the economy.\n\nFinally, the campaign organization turned out to be a little outdated when dealing with the way Trump was reaching persuadable voters. Trump’s campaign manager Susie Wiles, Whipple writes, wondered why O’Malley Dillon’s team ran such a “flawed campaign.” I thought they did not fight to win each day. Wiles concluded “it didn’t seem like she even tried” to win.\n\nEnding the Campaign on Cost of Living and Switching to Democracy\n\nAs soon as I listened to Tim Walz’s closing statement in the vice-presidential debate, I knew something had gone badly wrong. He mentioned the middle class and cost of living only once and instead talked about an amazing coalition that brought together progressives and Republicans, like Dick Cheney.\n\nThey stopped running the successful ad contrasting Harris and Trump on the cost of living. They stopped talking about an aggrieved middle class and stopped criticizing big business. Instead of talking about their economic plans, they attacked Trump to engage the anti-MAGA majority.\n\nThat was the strategy being promoted by Michael Podhorzer, a campaign strategist trusted by many Democrats.\n\nI wrote to David Binder, “It is hard to understand how thick is the campaign.”\n\nI called Lorraine Voles and exclaimed, “What the fuck is happening? Is she trying to lose the election?”\n\nIn reading the books, I wondered what the Obama advisers who had joined the campaign were doing. The campaign changed its main message, but they seemed more focused on adjusting the persuadable voter scale.\n\nIn the last ten days, however, Harris returned to talking about the cost of living and middle class. The contrast ad on Harris and Trump on the cost of living was back up. She put addressing the cost of living in first place on her “to-do list.” She did not mention Trump’s name for 24 hours.\n\nIdentity Politics, the Immigration Issue, and “Willie Horton”\n\nSoon after taking over from Biden, Harris campaigned and gave speeches in Nevada and Arizona. I was surprised when she only briefly talked about securing the border.\n\nNevada and Arizona were not even close, unlike the other battleground states. Some of her biggest drops in support came in the Southwest and Mountain States with long borders with Mexico. Trump’s plan to deport undocumented immigrants en masse was popular there, particularly with Hispanics. A poll of Hispanic voters in Arizona and Nevada found that voters prioritized a pathway to citizenship for long-residing undocumented immigrants, cracking down on human traffickers, and expanding border security.\n\nImmigration advocates told her that mentioning border security or the bipartisan bill to fix it would hurt her. That is why Harris gave her conventional speech on finally passing comprehensive immigration reform. They did not talk about the expanded monthly Child Tax Credit, her most popular policy, in her communication directed at Hispanic voters.\n\nWith both Hispanic and Black voters, the campaign prioritized a cocktail of bizarre issues, like protecting crypto assets, fully forgivable loans for small businesses, and health inequities. Some of the ideas were fine. But what Black voters actually prioritized was affordability provided by the restored Child Tax Credit, lower drug prices, and safety provided by reduced violent crime.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump spent $40 million on an ad attacking Harris for allowing transgender prisoners to get surgery at state expense. It ended, “Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you.”\n\nI reached out to both Binder and Voles on the issue. The books made clear that the campaign tested various responses but concluded none was as effective as changing the subject. I had some ideas. I had developed a response to the actual Horton ad that tested the strongest in California in 1988. You cannot leave such an attack unanswered.\n\nIt was emblematic of the entire campaign: unable to focus on the most obvious line of attack, switched between different campaigns, did not battle to win each day, and allowed the opponent to score many free hits. Harris did indeed benefit immensely from her launch, the Democratic convention, and debate. But then it fell apart. In my post-election poll, the top reasons to vote for Harris were to save democracy and stop fascism and to save the Affordable Care Act—not the issues that were at the top of voters’ minds.\n\nAnd after she lost, Biden said he would have won.\n\nWhere 2024 Leaves Democrats\n\nFor the past 15 years, the great working-class majority has heard Democratic presidents and nominees praise the American economy. Along with the mainstream media and economists, they cheer it as “the envy of the world.”\n\nDid our leader notice that the great majority have been largely treading water or worse for 25 years? The top 0.1 percent and 1 percent and 5 percent are devouring a growing share of income and especially wealth. At the same time, the obscene wealth of billionaires gives them tremendous political influence.\n\nWe also saw that voters believe Democrats govern unsafe, high-priced cities where mayors have lost control of homelessness, violent crime, and illegal immigrants. They believe “woke” elites prioritize transgender rights and education over bread-and-butter issues, and that elites think America’s legacy of slavery continues to limit America’s promise. Voters are not sure Democrats view America as exceptional and a land of opportunity.\n\nDemocrats can learn from that moment when Harris was poised to win. She was for the middle class, mainstream on cultural issues, and pushing clearly and consistently for economic and political change.","summary":"She was poised to claim the presidency, but Joe Biden and a disastrous campaign defeated her.","url":"https://prospect.org/culture/books/2025-05-14-kamala-could-have-won-whipple-allen-parnes-review/","image":"https://prospect.org/downloads/22872/download/JUN25%20Greenberg.jpg?cb=29b67d379cc44f0591080fa4880142d2&w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-14 09:15:00","author":"Stanley B.
