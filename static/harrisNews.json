In fact, economic data showed that conditions improved in most categories under Biden. Unemployment rates improved, especially in contrast to the economic downturn that occurred under Trump’s mishandling of the 2020 coronavirus pandemic. Regardless, Trump promised to fix all of the purported problems—like soaring egg prices—on “Day 1” of his presidency.\n\nThat didn’t happen and in recent weeks, economic conditions have worsened. Trump’s actions since he was sworn in on Jan. 20, from slashing the federal workforce via Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency to his haphazard and widely derided tariff announcements, have led to rising fears of an economic slowdown and possible recession.\n\nThe major stock indices fell for multiple days in a row in response to Trump’s unpredictable actions. But despite his extensive history of pointing to the market as validation or repudiation of economic action, Trump now says the markets are merely experiencing a “period of transition.”\n\nAnd Trump’s not the only one who is shrugging his shoulders.\n\nHis fellow Republican elected officials are downplaying recession fears and making excuses for Trump’s erratic tariff actions. Pro-Trump conservative media outlets like Fox News are all-in as well. On a recent episode of her prime-time show, host Laura Ingraham told viewers to “ignore” news of the market melting down.\n\nWhy is this happening? Because Trump said so and the right’s guiding principle since he was elected in 2016 is simple: Do as he says.\n\nThe party that howled when former President Barack Obama bailed out the auto industry was quiet in 2020, when Trump bailed out farmers suffering as a result of his trade war with China. When the jobs market was rocked during Trump’s first term, the same Republicans who spent nearly a decade chastising Obama for slow job growth didn’t have much to say. \n\nMore recently, after falsely accusing Biden of politicizing the justice system, Trump installed a weird acolyte who authored Trump fan fiction as the head of the FBI—with near-unanimous support from GOP senators.\n\nThe Republican Party is now in thrall to Trump’s cult of personality and has abandoned the few tenuous principles that conservatives once prioritized. \n\nEssentially, if Trump tells his supporters that the Earth is flat, they will turn on a dime and repeat the falsehood. Outlets like Fox News soon amplify the lie and build an echo chamber between themselves, Republican leaders, and Trump, repeating nonsense until it becomes a shared reality.\n\nThe Trump cult is so far gone that Republican voters are now cheering as their own relatives and friends are fired from their federal jobs at the capricious behest of his co-President Musk. But those same MAGA-philes didn’t even blink when the president turned the White House into a car lot and encouraged people to buy his buddy Elon’s $80,000 Teslas.\n\nThe mass delusion has now convinced many of those same supporters that they just have to tolerate rising prices for staple products, even though they likely would’ve rioted against paying more than $9 for a dozen eggs under a Democratic president.\n\nFor decades, conservatives have obliviously voted against their own interests when supporting candidates who cut social services and enact tax policies that hurt red state residents more than the rest of America. But under Trump, voting against their interests has become a point of pride—because as long as they please their cult leader, all is well.","summary":"Explaining the Right is a weekly series that looks at what the right wing is currently obsessing over, how it influences politics—and why you need to know.\n\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump campaigned in 2024 on the false notion that the policies put in place by President Joe Biden (along with Vice President Kamala Harris) had created economic chaos and out-of-control inflation.\n\n\n\nThis was untrue.

The GOP has advised party members to stop holding the town halls, although some have continued to do so.What To KnowEdwards made headlines this week for a particularly contentious town hall event that included the removal of several attendees as they questioned cuts to veteran assistance and other programs. Videos of hecklers yelling at Edwards have racked up over 1 million views in just days.He finally broke his silence on Saturday with an interview appearance on CNN, during which he addressed the anger of constituents and his own takeaways from the interactions in Asheville.Edwards surprised CNN's Fredricka Whitfield by saying he \"enjoyed the lively conversation,\" stressing that there were \"many people that took time to be there\" and \"took time to put questions in the box that they wanted answered.\"\"I believe it's part of the democratic process, even though it might be uncomfortable from time-to-time, I think town halls are necessary,\" Edwards said.The congressman added: \"I believe that we all need to go back and make sure that we have our facts right. I need to ask of the Trump White House that they provide the facts of the layoffs, for example, that they're making. And I believe that the American people, including those right there in that room, need to not necessarily believe the political talking points that they're seeing on Facebook, but actually get down to the facts.\"Edwards insisted that much of the discussion has centered on \"facts that were not in the bill\" that Congress passed this week in order to avoid a government shutdown, including claims that the bill would make cuts to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. He accused news media of repeating the facts without verifying them and that it was \"real easy for people to believe.\"\"There was an allegation that 80,000 people had been laid off that that was included in the budget that I helped pass. Nothing like that happened,\" Edwards said. \"There was an allegation that Medicare and Social Security were being cut. Nothing of the sort has happened.\"The congressman continued: \"I believe that we all need to make sure that we're speaking from the standpoint of what actually has happened and what's taking place, as opposed to listening to this political tripe.\"Edwards promised to have his team \"source and find out exactly what have been the cuts, how might they affect this district, and then I'll make the decision whether or not I feel they're in the best interest of this district or not.\"\"In some cases, the information that we need is just not there, which is one of the things that is important about us having an organization like Elon Musk and DOGE,\" he said.What People Are SayingPresident Donald Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social: \"Paid 'troublemakers' are attending Republican Town Hall Meetings. It is all part of the game for the Democrats, but just like our big LANDSLIDE ELECTION, it's not going to work for them!\"House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, told reporters at a news conference: \"We've seen this movie before. They're professional protesters. So why would we give them a forum to do that right now?Democratic Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, who was former Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate in last year's election wrote on Thursday on X, formerly Twitter: \"People want to make their voices heard, but their congressmen are hiding in Washington and refusing to do town halls. I'm going to join Democrats across the country to show up where Republicans aren't.\"What Happens Next?Edwards reiterated his commitment to holding town halls in the face of the backlash, telling CNN that he hit a pace of eight town halls in his first congressional term and would look to maintain a \"similar pace\" in his current term.Meanwhile, Democrats announced a series of town halls in Republican-held districts across the country, with Walz holding two that would start this weekend.","summary":"Republican lawmakers have been cautioned to avoid holding town halls after video of heckling made the rounds on social media.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/republican-lawmaker-chuck-edwards-speaks-town-hall-2045493","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2608175/norht-carolina-asheville-town-hall.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-15 22:42:20","author":"Peter Aitken","authors":["Peter Aitken"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.139},{"id":300593628,"title":"Kim Kardashian posts photo shoot with a Tesla Cybertruck and Optimus robot","text":"Some celebrities are ditching Elon Musk's Tesla to protest his work with DOGE and President Donald Trump's administration.Not Kim Kardashian, though.Kardashian appeared as the cover star for Perfect Magazine's upcoming issue, which included a Tesla-themed photo spread.

Some Instagram users criticized the post due to Tesla's newfound association with the Trump administration.A post shared by Perfect Magazine said the photos were snapped in Malibu, California, last November. It's been four months since then, and a lot has happened.Musk, Tesla's CEO, has become the target of criticism for his work with the White House DOGE Office, which is tasked with slashing the federal budget. DOGE has sought to reduce the federal workforce and cut numerous departments and agencies, including NASA, USAID, and Veteran's Affairs. Musk also faced ire from politicians in France, Germany, and the United Kingdom, who have britsled at his attempts to influence European politics.In response, Tesla sales are down in several global markets and the company's stock price has cratered. Critics have staged protests against Musk, and some Tesla owners — including Arizona Sen.

Roosevelt to place Japanese, Italian and German immigrants into internment camps during World War II, whether or not they were affiliated with military actions from their countries of origin.\n\n \"The Alien Enemies Act and complementing authorities have allowed presidents to target people on the basis of their identity, not their conduct or the threat they pose to national security,\" wrote Katherine Yon Ebright, a national security expert for the nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice, in October.\n\n \"In 1988, when Congress apologized and provided reparations for Japanese internment, it acknowledged that the policy was rooted in 'racial prejudice' and 'wartime hysteria,' not valid security concerns,\" she continued in her article, which centered around the dangers of the overly broad 18th-century law. \"Congress would later describe Italian internment as a 'fundamental injustice,' and the Department of Justice would recognize that German noncitizens had been targeted 'based on their ancestry.' \"\n\n Though the Alien Enemies Act is intended to be used only in wartime, and apply only when official governments have threatened military action, a president could conceivably weaponize the law to apply to people hailing from any country they deem to be \"invading\" the U.S. — which is how Trump has described several nations whose residents have sought refuge in the States.\n\n People familiar with the Trump campaign's early policy deliberations previously told Rolling Stone that he came up with a \"very convoluted and crazy\" theory for how he can abuse the law to justify mass deportations, even if the U.S. is not at war with a foreign government.\n\n Trump has long been known for spouting anti-immigration rhetoric, but his new mass deportation program — helmed by \"border czar\" Tom Homan — has sparked concern about the safety of immigrants and people of color who are perceived to be in the country illegally.\n\n At the Aurora campaign rally in October, local journalist Kyle Clark reported that, while discussing migrant crime, Trump said, \"We have to live with these animals. But we won’t live with them for long.\" Immediately after, a supporter in the crowd shouted, \"Kill them!\"\n\n Also at the event, Trump immigration adviser Stephen Miller — a White nationalist whose organization America First Legal was initially listed on the advisory board of Project 2025 — said that under Trump, the United States will return to being a country of \"only Americans,\" even though the nation is largely composed of immigrants and their descendants.\n\n Miller has since been named Trump's homeland security adviser and the deputy White House chief of staff for policy.","summary":"The Alien Enemies Act of 1798 is a widely condemned detainment law designed to be used in the throes of war.

What happens to truth when someone takes the teaspoon away?\n\nWhen Donald Trump fronted his first debate of the US presidential campaign against then-Vice President Kamala Harris, back in September last year, he made what has become a notorious accusation: migrants in a small Ohio town were eating the local pets.\n\n\"A lot of towns don't want to talk about it because they're so embarrassed by it,\" then presidential candidate Trump said. \"In Springfield, they're eating the dogs. The people that came in, they're eating the cats. They're eating — they're eating the pets of the people that live there.\"\n\nThis assertion by now-President Trump, that Haitian immigrants were abducting and eating their neighbour's dogs and cats, was rapidly fact-checked by multiple news outlets and eventually awarded \"Lie of the Year\" for 2024 by PolitiFact, an organisation that ushered in a new era of fact-check journalism when it launched in 2007.\n\nFrom Time magazine's pioneering research department in the 1920s to the New Yorker's renowned and rigorous fact-checking department, verifying facts is as old as journalism itself. The rise of the 24-hour news cycle, ubiquity of social media and subsequent spread of online misinformation and disinformation have since demanded more from journalists and editors. It has forced newsrooms to improve their internal verification processes but has also led to the proliferation of specialised fact-check outfits like AAP FactCheck in Australia or AFP Fact Check, which now has a network of 150 journalists across 26 languages publishing checks on everything from Russia's invasion of Ukraine to COVID-19.\n\nAmong the thousands of fact-checks published in the past year fact-checkers in Australia and abroad have debunked a wealth of manipulated footage in the Israel-Gaza conflict, found Labor misrepresented the Coalition's stance on free GP visits, concluded Opposition Leader Peter Dutton was wrong on tourist visas, discredited the claim Kamala Harris wanted to take away Americans ability to \"eat red meat\" and investigated whether planes are actually crashing more often (they're not).\n\nThe era of 'fake news'\n\nThe political ascendancy of Trump heralded a golden era for fact-checkers. Throughout, Mark Zuckerberg's social media giant Meta played a significant role in the fact-checking industry.\n\nIn 2016, soon after Trump's first election to the US presidency, Meta launched its program paying independent fact-checkers to flag and debunk disinformation on its products, mobilising a global battalion of people fighting falsehood's on the world's most popular platforms.\n\nIt wasn't just Meta's partners who expanded their fact-check operations during this period but legacy media outlets. During the first Trump presidency The Washington Post's fact-checkers declared he had made 30,573 false or misleading claims. By 2017 \"fake news\" was named the word of the year. In August last year the then-presidential candidate almost backed out of an interview once it became clear he would be fact-checked live and then in October cancelled an interview with American 60 Minutes after his campaign complained the program would fact-check the interview.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2021 the number of international third-party fact-checkers grew tenfold but after eight years of continued growth, research from the Reporters' Lab, a centre for journalism research at Duke University, found that the number of active fact-checking projects across 111 countries dropped for the first time in 2023 and then again in 2024.\n\nThen, in the wake of Trump's recent election win, fact-checkers were dealt another blow. Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads, promptly scrapped the teams of professional and third party fact-checkers in the United States.\n\n\"It's time to get back to our roots around free expression,\" Meta founder and CEO Zuckerberg declared in January.\n\nAnd with that fact-checkers were replaced with a crowdsourced \"community notes\" system similar to that on Elon Musk's X. Instead of using accredited fact-checkers to debunk and flag misleading or inaccurate content that should be marked with a warning label, this model relies on other social media users to add context or caveats to a post.\n\nRight now, the roll-back applies only to the US but Meta funds more than 100 fact-checking organisations across the world and has not ruled out further partnership terminations. \n\nThe social media giant's most recent report, via Australia's code of practice on misinformation and disinformation, found that in the 2023 calendar year it took action on more than 9,700 pieces of content for violating misinformation policies. Warnings were displayed on more than 9.2 million distinct pieces of content on Facebook based on articles raising concern that were written by its third-party fact-checking partners in Australia at the time: AAP FactCheck, Agence France-Presse and RMIT FactLab.\n\nZuckerberg has promoted the about face as a win for \"free expression\".\n\n\"Governments and legacy media have pushed to censor more and more but now we have the opportunity to restore free expression, and I'm excited to take it,\" Zuckerberg, who once proudly told US congress Meta's fact-checking program was \"industry leading\", said.\n\nMeta's decision was criticised as 'spineless and opportunistic', condemned as a move that will disproportionately harm marginalised communities and described as a change that would encourage the \"exact same surge of hate, disinformation and conspiracy theories that caused January 6\". Critics of the move have said it was made in an effort to curry favour with the incoming US president, who has been routinely fact-checked by multiple third-party outfits and publications.\n\nAsked directly if Zuckerberg's decision was a response to threats Trump had made to him in the past (he once threatened to jail the Meta CEO), the president responded: \"Probably. Yeah. Probably.\"\n\nThe growing politicisation of fact-checkers\n\nIn November Brendan Carr, picked by Trump to head the Federal Communications Commission, sent an email to the CEOs of Meta, Apple, Alphabet (Google's holding company) and Microsoft. He accused them of participating in a \"censorship cartel\" and singled out fact-checking. \n\nThis suspicion of fact-checking is not only shared by members of Trump's administration but by his voter base. A 2019 study found seven in 10 Republicans say fact-checkers tend to favour one side, compared with roughly three in 10 Democrats. In the lead up to the US election those on the left of politics criticised CNN for declining to fact-check Trump in real time during his debate with Joe Biden while those on the right criticised (the American) ABC News moderators for fact-checking that network's debate.\n\nIn the wake of Meta's decision, 130 fact-check organisations wrote an open letter to Zuckerberg reiterating the \"strict non-partisanship standards\" Meta's partners had to attain through verification by the International Fact-Checking Network, which requires annual verification, including independent assessment and peer review. They disputed the tech billionaire's accusations of censorship as Meta never granted fact-checkers the ability or authority to take down content or remove accounts.\n\nThe head of the network, Angie Drobnic Holan, said at the time that Meta's move was made \"in the wake of extreme political pressure from a new administration and its supporters\".\n\nHolan is a former editor-in-chief of PolitiFact — one of the first dedicated fact-checking groups — and was part of the Pulitzer Prize-winning team of journalists who examined claims made by politicians during the 2008 US presidential campaign. She says there has been growing political pressure on fact-checkers, particularly over the past 15 years.\n\n\"The most disturbing trend is that activists, political parties and elected officials have tried to discredit fact-checking as an activity in and of itself because it doesn't align with their preferred narratives,\" she tells the ABC.\n\n\"This includes direct attacks alleging bias or political motives, attempts to discredit fact-checkers as incompetent or as censors and overarching efforts to undermine public trust in independent journalism and verification.\"\n\nWhat's happening in Australia?\n\nFact-check journalists and misinformation experts in Australia have testified that their work feels increasingly politicised while one of three third-party fact-checking outfits here has shut up shop. RMIT FactLab recently confirmed it has ended its third-party fact checking work. In June last year the ABC ended its separate and seven-year collaboration with the university called the RMIT ABC Fact Check unit. AAP FactCheck recently confirmed it will continue to provide checks for Meta for at least another 12 months while international news wire AFP told the ABC the outlet was also committed to the program for this year in Australia. \n\n\"Fact-checkers in Australia and elsewhere have unwillingly become part of the culture wars and a target for people who want to make the claim that free speech is being quashed,\" William Summers, former chief fact-check journalist for AAP FactCheck, says.\n\nDuring the Voice to Parliament referendum campaign RMIT FactLab drew criticism from Sky News Australia, Liberal senator James Paterson and conservative think tank the Institute of Public Affairs during the Voice to Parliament.\n\nAndrea Carson, La Trobe University's professor of political communication, says in 2022 her team did survey experiments on trust in fact-checkers in Australia and found there were \"high levels of trust in Australia for fact-checking\" and, at that time, \"very little difference between the brands\".\n\n\"Fact-checking tends to be more highly regarded by those on the left side of politics than the right in the US and we are seeing some of that politicisation and polarisation of fact-checkers starting to happen in Australia but it became most prominent during the Voice to Parliament referendum,\" Carson tells the ABC.\n\n\"We did another study during the Voice to Parliament referendum, also on fact-checking and asking about trust. We saw a noticeable dive for RMIT FactLab and that came off the back of that concerted campaign against RMIT FactLab. We saw trust had fallen for that brand for those on the right side of politics and particularly those who were consumers of Sky News.\"\n\nCarson stressed that while Australia was experiencing \"elements of politicisation\" when it comes to fact-checking there was still a high level of trust, and it was \"nowhere near the extreme of what is going on in the US\".\n\n\"Also, when trust does fall like it did during that concerted campaign for that particular brand, we don't know how long that lasts unless we go back and study it,\" she says.\n\nThe Conversation conducted research with global media monitoring company Meltwater and found of the most popular posts in Australia about the Voice in a three-month period leading up to the referendum, an article by Sky News Australia accusing RMIT FactLab of working with Meta to \"censor\" the Voice debate came in second.\n\nConcerns about fact-checkers have been raised in Australia's parliament by politicians over the past few years. \n\nGerard Rennick, in 2023 questioned bureaucrats bureaucrats from the Australian Communications and Media Authority about \"who gets to fact check the fact-checkers\" and grilled the ABC chair on a fact-check involving a vaccine death. Malcolm Roberts said all three of Australia’s third-party fact-checking organisations exercised \"consistent bias\" and late last year Matt Canavan accused AAP FactCheck of “effectively silencing political arguments” during the Voice debate.\n\nMeanwhile fact-checkers and misinformation academics have raised their own concerns about the increasing politicisation of their work.\n\n\"During the Voice referendum there was so much misinformation and disinformation being pushed around but because it was a politicised debate, fact-checkers were being accused of bias,\" Summers remembers.\n\nHe says not only did no one in the team embark on a fact-check to make a political point, \"the opposite happened to a certain extent\". He says fact-checkers struggled to find more false claims from the Yes campaign \"because there were so many false claims from the no side it dominated the debate\".\n\nThese false claims included that ticks in the No box would be counted as a Yes; Pauline Hansons's assertion that politicians would have to consult the Voice about private members' bills; former boxing champ Anthony Mundine’s claim that Indigenous people would become British subjects if the Yes vote won at the referendum and and Dutton’s claim that the prime minister had never mentioned the Voice before the election.\n\nA cyber security report by global intelligence research organisation Recorded Future revealed concerted efforts by far-right groups and an army of bots to spread false information undermining the Voice to Parliament. A few months before the vote Meta shut down 9,000 Facebook and Instagram accounts run by a group linked to Chinese authorities that, among other things, had been spreading misinformation on the Voice.\n\nSummers believes most people are unaware that some foreign countries are \"pushing to pollute Australia's information space\". \n\nHe described a fact-check he did last year for AAP in which he looked into posters, claimed to have been created by Amnesty International, protesting Israel's participation in the 2024 Olympics and found in fact Iran's state media had published the computer-generated images of Israeli athletes brutalising Palestinians.\n\n\"A lot of this misinformation and disinformation is not just naively shared, some of it is very intentionally shared by people who don't have Australia's interests at heart,\" he says.\n\nThe removal of fact-checks comes as Meta revamps a program that rewards creators with bonuses based on views and engagement. A former Meta data scientist has warned this could create a welcome environment for those spreading \"viral hoaxes for profit\".\n\nThere were usually two reasons people spread falsehoods, Summers says: for ideological gain or for financial gain.\n\n\"Most social media platforms now pay out for viral content either directly when you get over a certain number of views or indirectly because you are building your own platform and one easy way to do that is to produce content which is surprising but a lot of surprising content either misses context or is just completely untrue,\" he says.\n\n\"We are more likely to share the surprising unverified content over verified facts and uncertainty.\"\n\nIs there a role for fact-checking in 2025?\n\nCarson argues that fact-checking was good at identifying misinformation in the first instance but is not a \"standalone solution\" and has its limits.\n\n\"It is a fairly consistent finding that you can't really use fact-checking to move viewpoints of a political nature, and we found that in our own research,\" she says.\n\n\"When people have a set idea about something and it is fact-checked, it doesn't move their opinion of it because they have motivated reasoning, which is usually politically motivated, for staying with that particular idea.\"\n\nOne of Carson's studies found that even though people trusted a fact-check and \"accepted it had done its job\", it didn't always stop them spreading the political misinformation.\n\n\"A third of our respondents just went ahead and spread it anyway both on the left and the right of politics and they gave different rationales for that,\" she says.\n\nThe study used a video of Scott Morrison that had been falsely labelled to say the former prime minister had blamed flood victims for \"weaponising their trauma\" against the government.\n\n\"What we found is that people on the left would share that, even though they knew it had been fact-checked and they did so because some of them didn't like Scott Morrison,\" Carson says. \n\nShe says they justified their actions because they believed it was the kind of thing that Morrison would say even if he didn't say it in this instance.\n\n\"Those on the right shared it to highlight the kind of things they thought people on the left would spread and to call it out,\" she says.\n\nHolan is clear on what the process does — \"provides people with reliable information\" — and doesn't do.\n\n\"It doesn't promote political agendas, win or lose elections, or convince people to change their political values or beliefs,\" she says.\n\n\"When people disagree, it's not necessarily because they have the wrong facts. Sometimes they need to persuade each other and find compromises. That's a political process that goes beyond fact-checking, but facts can help people make a good start on more honest dialogues.\"\n\nHolan says the priority for fact-checkers in 2025 was to do work that \"preserves reality and resists false narratives\".\n\n\"Fact-checkers need to do the day-to-day work that helps the public understand that facts and evidence do matter, and that reality will eventually assert itself over lies,\" she says.\n\nThe impact of community notes has been mixed.\n\nAs ABC News has reported, a study by University of California researchers published by the American Medical Association found community notes provided entirely accurate information about COVID-19 vaccines 97.5 per cent of the time. Another study found community notes increased the probability that the author deletes the original post by 80 per cent. \n\nIronically, an analysis of almost 1.2 million notes written in 2024 and released earlier this year found users frequently relied on fact-checking organisations when proposing community notes. \n\nHowever, a study from academics in Luxembourg, Melbourne and Germany published late last year found no evidence that the introduction of community notes on X/Twitter significantly reduced engagement with misleading posts on the platform. The authors concluded the system might be \"too slow to effectively reduce engagement with misinformation in the early (and most viral) stage of diffusion\".\n\nCarson says there needs to be more peer-reviewed research on how effective the community notes model is.\n\n\"The benefits of third-party fact-checking was that it was professionals that usually have training in journalism and it had a degree of accountability because the fact-checkers, at least those used by Meta, were registered with the International Fact-Checking Network and had a set of principles that emphasises political neutrality,\" she says.\n\nWhat does the future of fact-checking look like?\n\nSummers describes fact-checking as trying to clean up a sewage spill using a teaspoon.\n\n\"And for every teaspoon of information you pull out and fact-check someone is pouring a full tanker back into the ocean,\" he says.\n\n\"Fact-checkers in Australia and elsewhere have all been making significant moves to address some of the more structural issues around educating where misinformation comes from, who is responsible for it and increasing awareness of AI-generated content, and trying to improve awareness of what a good quality study is compared to a poor study written by someone with skin in the game.\"\n\nSummers says the Meta decision marks a victory in the war against fact-checking but the legacy of fact-checkers will live on in newsrooms as it is now \"ingrained\" in so much of what journalists do every day.\n\n\"Instead of fact-checking teams I think the concept of writing articles with the purpose of checking facts is much more central to what news organisations do now,\" he says.\n\nSummers is also glad to see publications that both deliver stories exposing falsehoods and also \"tell people how to spot misinformation or an AI-generated image\", noting the work of teams like BBC Verify and ABC News Verify.\n\nCarson would also like to see even more in-house fact-checking by journalists and more \"active adjudication\".\n\n\"When a false claim is made by a politician instead of 'he said, she said' coverage and giving equal weight to a known false claim, active adjudication is when the journalist calls it out there and then and gives the reason for it rather than giving false balance,\" she says.\n\nFact-checking offers an important opportunity to communicate verified and credible information which is important for decision making. This is particularly so when it comes to political choices, Carson says. \n\n\"Political choices underpin a healthy democracy and help people make considered informed choices, then they decide who is going to represent them at the ballot box,\" she says.\n\nHolan says Meta's actions are in response to the politics of the day in the United States \"rather than an authentic indictment of fact-checkers' work\". She believes the decision is a \"temporary victory\" for those who want to see fact-checking become extinct.\n\n\"Surveys show that the public wants to have online information moderated and that they don't have a lot of patience for navigating through torrents of false news,\" she says.\n\nShe says social media companies that aren't run simply as political projects, like X, will continue to grapple with the need to provide positive user experiences. That includes cultivating reliable information.\n\n\"Fact-checkers were here before the Meta program, and they'll be here even if the Meta program goes away.\"\n\nWords: Gina Rushton\n\nProduction: Catherine Taylor\n\nImages: Lindsay Dunbar","summary":"Checking facts is as old as journalism and Donald Trump's political rise has underscored its value.

They wanted to “take back” the party from the self-imagined villains they oppose. They wrote manifestos and donor memos and positioned themselves against “the groups.” Just a couple weeks ago, they organized a retreat where they condemned “ideological purity tests” as their path to a brighter future.\n\nI’m struck by how irrelevant that all sounds, less than two months into Donald Trump’s second term. It feels like these people are arguing about proper salad fork etiquette while their house is on fire. There’s a much more elemental question animating Democratic politics at the moment, if you bother to listen to people who still call themselves Democrats (or even independents): is the party in opposition to Donald Trump going to oppose anything?\n\nWe saw this week what in retrospect was a predictable answer to that question. House Democrats, who face voters every two years, who must pay attention to the public mood, saw the government funding deadline as an early and important moment of defiance against the ransacking of America. They didn’t come to it on the basis of being progressive or moderate, in a safe seat or a swing district. They listened to their voters, who were looking for some sign of life among Democrats, or a plan to staunch the bleeding of an economic and moral collapse.\n\nBut Trump is also a great uniter of his own side, and he was able to pull the Freedom Caucus in on a spending bill for the first time in ages by promising he would continue to impound and delete programs regardless of what the bill said. Happy to outsource the carnage and the responsibility, all Republicans went with it. So it fell to the Senate, where Democratic votes would be needed on the bill for it to pass.\n\nSenate Democrats don’t face voters every two years. They have the luxury of overthinking themselves into oblivion, inventing scenarios to avoid confrontation that they can reverse-engineer into seeming wise. That’s what Chuck Schumer did, retreating from the fight and advancing a bill he called abhorrent to avoid a government shutdown, as if we’re not experiencing that already.\n\nProgressive Caucus chair Greg Casar (D-TX) may have summed it up best: “Today the biggest split among Democrats is between those who want to stand and fight and those who want to play dead.” There’s a Fearless Caucus and a Fear Caucus, a caucus who understands the risk of failure and wants to try to win anyway, and a caucus consumed by failure, straitjacketed by risk, who cowers and bows and shrinks from conflict.\n\nThat’s a split inside Washington. It’s not a close question in the rest of the country. There, the stand and fight faction is dominant, seen in the boiling anger at town hall meetings that caused Republicans to stop holding them. Gov. Tim Walz, who stood in for one of those Republicans at a swing district in Eau Claire, Wisconsin yesterday, went viral for some red meat mocking an “unelected South African nepo baby.” But what he said right before that made the critical point: “There’s a responsibility in this time of chaos where elected officials need to hear what people are irritated about. And I would argue that Democratic officials should hear the primal scream that’s coming from America, (which) is, ‘Do something, dammit! This is wrong!’”\n\nWalz was part of the losing ticket last November, and has the perspective of meeting people from across the country and gauging the national mood. His main takeaway was that the campaign was too cautious, too buttoned-down, too unwilling to take risks. That’s the correct lesson, because it has migrated from a tactical failing to a defining feature of the Democratic Party.\n\nI certainly have views about what policies would bring about shared prosperity in America, and I believe that most of them would prove out as good politics. But I also agree that the Democrats’ major problem, before the election and certainly today, is that they are perceived as weak. Anything that perpetuates that image is poisonous for the party.\n\nThere is white-hot anger across the country right now, and responding to that with cowardice will end your political career. Maybe not today; a theoretical primary challenge for Schumer is three years away, when he would be 77. But his lack of leadership has been exposed. Democrats want a different party, one with a pulse, and eventually they will get it.\n\nThe politicians who understand this are not neatly grouped ideologically or generationally. Bernie Sanders, still out there giving speeches to thousands at age 83, is in the Fearless caucus; on this issue, so was Nancy Pelosi. AOC has led the charge, but this was among the most eloquent statements I’ve seen this week:\n\n“Last night, House Democrats stood united against a bill that would let President Trump and Elon Musk shut down whatever part of the government they want, whenever they want. Now all eyes are on the Senate, the only institution in government where Democrats have true leverage thanks to the filibuster. Leader Schumer and Senate Democrats must use that leverage to fight for Americans facing higher costs, bigger deficits, and an intentional recession. They must use their leverage to bring Republicans to the negotiating table on President Trump’s unconstitutional funding cuts that violate the separation of powers.\n\n“Congress is a co-equal branch of government, and we should take this opportunity to remind President Trump that he is not all-powerful. It’s time to stand up for our country and for Congress’s role as a check and balance on an overzealous President. If not now, when? If not us, then who?”\n\nThat’s from Rep. Scott Peters (D-CA), former vice chair of the New Democrat Coalition and a member of the Problem Solvers Caucus.\n\nFederal employees, who would be at risk of furlough or even termination in a shutdown, are in the Fearless Caucus. The lawyers and state attorneys general taking the Trump administration to court are in the Fearless Caucus. The ordinary people taking time out of their day to picket in front of a Tesla showroom or yell at their representative in Congress are in the Fearless Caucus. Even those who are pissed off by a weakening economy are in the Fearless Caucus, suggesting that the caucus is a majority of the country.\n\nWhen there’s this big a disconnect between a party’s leadership and the voters, it cannot last.","summary":"For the moment, it is not ideological; it’s about whether you’re willing to take a risk.","url":"https://prospect.org/politics/2025-03-15-fault-line-democratic-politics-schumer-AOC-fight/","image":"https://prospect.org/downloads/22608/download/AP25073817539804rs.jpg?cb=b405a75f79192688174dae8e32b1e47e&w=4000","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-15 16:40:00","author":"David Dayen","authors":["David Dayen"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.175},{"id":300512562,"title":"This group of Trump voters will piss you off—and give you hope","text":"This is an occasional roundup of people who voted for Donald Trump and are shocked to find out no one is immune from the damage and pain he causes. Many are now grappling with the consequences of their choice as it affects them and their loved ones—and possibly regretting their vote.\n\nAxios gathered 13 Michigan voters who voted for Donald Trump in 2024 after voting for Joe Biden in 2020, and gauged their opinions of the new administration. The results were both encouraging and infuriating—often at the same time. \n\n“Ten of 13 participants from this battleground, auto-industry state bordering Canada said what they're seeing isn't what they thought they were voting for—and they're worried Trump's approach may hurt their pocketbooks,” wrote Axios. \n\nFrom the start, this conclusion is obnoxious. People voted for Trump—even as he openly and repeatedly promised to hurt other people—because they either wanted other people to get hurt, or didn’t care. Either way, that makes them shitty people. \n\n“Another voter, who owns a health and weight loss business, said most of her clients are in the auto industry—if they're hit it could devastate her,” wrote Axios. “One said she works in the auto industry and just got furloughed because ‘we are not building any cars right now.’”\n\nThey loved Trump when he promised to hurt other people, but they don’t like it when they themselves are facing the consequences of their vote. It’s hard to feel sorry for this crowd. But there is also a great deal of dumb, dumb, dumb. \n\n\"I don't feel like he was this aggressive last time because I don't think anyone would've voted for him if they expected to see what we're seeing now,\" said Shannon B., a 27-year-old from Livonia, Michigan.\n\nI’ll give Shannon a little bit of a pass since she was 19 at the start of Trump’s first presidency, with that underdeveloped frontal lobe. But … those of us paying attention can’t fathom why anyone would vote for him given what we saw the first time. \n\n\"He's so erratic, and it's getting to the point where I'm almost scared to watch the news,” said Sheryl M., a 44-year-old from Chesterfield. \"I mean, it's a little bit frightening 'cause each day is something new, so you get a little anxious.\"\n\nThis might be excusable if Trump hadn’t been erratic for his entire first term and then for the entire 2024 campaign cycle. In other words, inexcusable. \n\n\"I mean, Canada? When have we ever had issues with Canada?\" asked Dearborn Height’s Phil L., age 45. \"We barely have a border. You can go in and out of the country and a lot of places, a lot of states. I think we're just barking up the wrong tree with this.\"\n\nGiven that Trump spent his first term making enemies out of our allies, and coddling up to dictators in Russia, North Korea, China, and elsewhere, why would anyone act surprised is beyond me. \n\nTherese L., a 55-year-old from Commerce Township, was disgusted by that creepy AI image of Trump wearing a crown, saying \"long live the king,\" and claiming that \"He who saves his country doesn't violate any law.” \"He is acting like a dictator,\" said Therese L.\n\nAnd who warned her that Trump’s behaviors during his first term and campaign rhetoric were dictatorial? Wasn’t even us liberals! It was the very people who served in his first administration! \n\n\"[Trump] campaigned on lowering prices and making things more affordable for working-class people. He's moving in the opposite direction,\" said Michael L., a 43-year-old also out of Commerce Township. Axios further noted that Michael L. “conceded that Trump had previewed tariffs during the campaign, but said ‘we didn't necessarily think it would be this much, this fast.’\"\n\nAaaargh! I’ve noted before how powerful this feeling is—that Trump ran on lowering prices, and everything he’s done since has raised prices. It’ll be his eventual undoing, practically inevitable in my opinion. That’s why his pathetic Tesla stunt was particularly damaging to him. \n\nStill, a huge group of people who voted for him didn’t understand what tariffs were about. Michael L. apparently did—and still voted for him. It really is amazing how Trump gets people to believe his lies and not believe his truths. Trump is doing exactly what he promised, so why are people surprised if they were paying any attention? \n\n\"[I fear] that this will eventually turn into a dictatorship,” said Malea H., a 34-year-old from Clinton Township. “[I]f the people that we elected to be his checks and balances don't check and balance him, then what are they there for?\" \n\nMaybe don’t vote for wannabe dictators who have already stressed our institution? Yes, Democrats need to put up a fiercer fight. But that doesn’t absolve her of her vote. I don’t dump chemicals into a city’s water supply, then complain that authorities aren’t cleaning it up fast enough. \n\nSo 10 of 13 aren’t happy with Trump, but … “Only one of the 10 Trump voters-turned-critics said they'd choose Kamala Harris for president if they could do it over,” according to Axios.\n\nThat sounds damning, and it is. People don’t like to admit they made wrong choices, so they’ll rationalize their decision until the end of their days. Kamala would’ve been worse is a popular rationale. \n\nHere’s the thing: We will never change the minds of the MAGA cult. The vast majority of Trump voters will stick by their decision to vote for him, and they’ll keep voting for Republicans up and down the ticket. Changing their minds is not our job, however. \n\nOne of 13 Trump voters would’ve switched their vote to Harris, and that’s 7.7% of the whole that might vote differently next time. The story doesn’t say whether the rest would’ve still voted Trump or sat out the election or voted or voted third party or what. Given the fears of “dictatorship” from several of the panelists, presumably many would stay home. In any case, shift the vote in some battleground states by just a few percentage points and Harris would’ve won. \n\nThe core cult won’t shift. But if we can get 7.7% of Trump voters to regret their vote and shift to the Democrats, that would reshape the electoral landscape. That kind of shift would dramatically expand the presidential and Senate maps, and make it impossible for Republicans to win the House. \n\nThat’s our job, reaching those people.","summary":"This is an occasional roundup of people who voted for Donald Trump and are shocked to find out no one is immune from the damage and pain he causes.

Specifically, it discusses the political campaign led by the Italian and Zionist establishment in early March, which aimed to prevent the book’s presentation at La Sapienza University. This campaign and its controversy impacted various groups on the left and far-left of the political spectrum. The author’s central argument is that this situation highlights a historical trend of left-wing eurocentrism and how that trend influences the international Palestinian resistance movement, particularly within Western countries.\n\nThe Union of Young Jews of Italy, Italian Radicals, Left for Israel, Jewish Communities in Italy, young socialists, Forza Italia Giovani, other Catholic associations and associations of the Zionist Hasbara, in early March, appealed for the Sapienza University of Rome to revoke the permits granted to the Palestinian Student Movement.\n\nThey aimed to prevent the 5 March presentation of the autobiographical book The Thorns and the Carnation by Sinwar (with the participation of Davide Piccardo of the Islamic-inspired publishing house Editori della Luce, the book’s Italian publisher) from taking place within the Physics Department.\n\nThe appeal, titled “Terrorism out of the University”, stated: “La Sapienza, one of the few universities to have opposed boycotts against Israel and to have positioned itself as a bastion of academic freedom, still has the opportunity to prevent it from turning into a sounding board for terrorism,” immediately became a national political issue. The request in the appeal was supported by major Italian liberal democracy newspapers such as La Repubblica, Il Corriere dello Sera, Il Giornale and Il Messaggero. In turn, the newspapers reported the requests by Giovanni Donzelli and Noemi Di Segni for the Faculty of Physics to backtrack and ban the initiative.\n\nREAD: Tensions rise between Washington, Tel Aviv over US-Hamas Talks\n\nSinwar’s autobiographical book, written during his twenty-two years in Israeli prisons, is currently censored and banned from publication in many Western and European Union countries, but not in Italy, thanks to an Italian publisher who converted to Islam. It is also not banned in Ireland, whose back cover edition says: “Since Al-Sinwar was martyred while bravely fighting against the Israeli genocide in Gaza, the novel emerges as a vital piece of literature for those seeking to understand the ongoing tensions in the Middle East. It is more than just a story… With Al-Sinwar’s martyrdom, his novel represents both a reflection on the past and a prophetic vision of the future of the region.”\n\nThe book advances the reasoning behind the oppressed who resist out of necessity, in a written testament by Sinwar, who died fighting, which becomes the legacy of the living who cannot and do not want to give up.\n\nThe initiative promoted by Palestinian students at the university sparks reflection on a historical, theoretical and political challenge to Western nations, for whom even the written word of a deceased person is frightening. The university, as Western propaganda—well interpreted by Zionist liberalism—writes, is precisely the place that must honour the values of the Western ideology of democracy and freedom, whose myth is crumbling, causing a deep crisis gripping the West and leading Europe towards its decline.\n\nThe editorial operation undertaken by the Italian publisher is influenced by the point of view of Islamism. For Palestinian students, it is the reflection of the need for resistance that did not bow to the genocide in Gaza and is trying not to bow now to an even more bloody ethnic cleansing in the West Bank. Therefore, the revocation of the permits to hold the initiative by the university institutions was given because only the deluded do not understand that at this stage, for the hopes of Western democracy, the genocide of the Palestinian people is a necessary evil, as much of the press writes. Therefore, censorship is a vital reason for democracy. Despite the establishment of political fire and the physical threats received by Zionist groups, the Palestinian students reiterated their will to maintain the initiative.\n\nThe Palestinian students, beyond the usual rhetoric about the denied democratic spaces, found largely silence and indifference from a large part of the left groups and left activists who had initially been active in solidarity with Palestine. A silence broken only by the boycott carried out by so-called antagonistic areas of the “far” left, with the motivation that the publisher—an Italian who converted to Islam—is not a person liked by them. Thus, this reinforced the political conditions for which the Campus Student Collective revoked their support for the initiative that the Palestinian Student Movement was organising at that point.\n\nFrom the rhetorical condemnation of the imposed censorship and the renewed solidarity with the Palestinian resistance, the “far” left student groups have moved on to reiterate: “We would like to point out that despite the ban announced by the university, the decision to postpone the initiative was the result of political considerations linked to the choice, which we consider inadequate, to invite the speaker mentioned above.”\n\nIn essence, some with silence and some with open sabotage, the last epigones of left-wing “extremism” inside and outside the university, have bowed to the will of his majesty the establishment. For what reason? Because Piccardo was invited to participate at the end of November 2024 in a conference on “Palestine and Lebanon, from the clash of civilisations to global civil war” promoted by the right-wing neo-fascist organisation CasaPound, which, being a man of convinced Islamic faith, has the illusion of breaking hearts and democratically saving souls. Meanwhile, the neo-fascist right tries to play cards it does not have in an attempt to exploit for the nationalist purposes of an imperialist country, such as Italy, the competing point of view of certain Islamic currents towards Western liberalism.\n\nWe do not know Piccardo, nor are we interested in his political and ideological reasons because that is not what this is about. If anything, we should reason why, in all of Europe, only one Islamist-inspired publishing house published Sinwar’s autobiography, immediately earning a ban, while in Europe, the same publication has not found any sponsor in the so-called underground and left-wing publishing, and in Ireland, the book has been published through the free press internet and on-demand platforms. It seems clear to us that it is not because of an incident concerning Piccardo that the Palestinian students’ initiative was deemed inadequate. Surely, there was more than one sigh of relief by the left when it found “impeccable” reasons—against the fascist of the moment—and took the thorny issue out of its hands, throwing away the whole carnation.\n\nBLOG: Israel’s use of human shields in Gaza is part of its genocide against Palestinians\n\nIt was, and is, a question of deliberately ignoring a real resistance that isn’t expressed in a way that left-wing “extremism” prefers. We have supported and argued for this need for resistance in several recent articles, a need that Hamas embodies as its unified expression, attracting what remains of the old secular left-wing Palestinian political forces, in contrast to resignation and collaboration with Israel.\n\nThe fact, already serious in itself if we consider the context of general and verbal political aggression suffered by an organisation of young Palestinians by pro-Zionist political and institutional forces, is not limited to the low-level political dialectic that the so-called far-left continues to demonstrate. It recalls historical, material and political factors that are much more general, without which such political stupidity, which in any case abounds, is incomprehensible. We are in the presence of how, in the face of the crisis of the West in a composite and articulated way in Europe and Italy, the reasons for democracy, the idealistic anti-fascism and the individual freedoms achieved are worth more than the reasons for the resistance of the Palestinians called by the left to review their priorities.\n\nThis is a general dynamic that occurs in every Western country depending on the specific cases and in a differentiated manner with respect to the composite and international mobilisation in support of the Palestinian cause. It was the case in the US, whereby the Arab and Palestinian communities there, as well as African Americans, should have overlooked and voted for Kamala Harris against the “worst evil” Donald Trump, who promised and promises to bring hell into Palestine to annihilate Hamas and its resistance and complete the work of the ethnic cleansing—which is the common objective of Israel and jointly of all Western countries.\n\nIt is becoming more pressing in Italy and in Europe, which is struggling with the exhaustion of an ascending historical cycle that has seen it dominate the world for 500 years, so it is a question of supporting all the “non-sovereignist” political forces and the resistance in Ukraine against Russia, defending the democracy in Europe against Trump’s “neo-populism” that attacks it from the outside and European sovereignisms from the inside, counteracting its own fade and continuing to maintain the dividend of colonial and imperialist loot. In essence, the crumbling of Europe, put under pressure, gives impetus to a wave that also propagates to the left in concentric, or rather eurocentric, circles.\n\nAre we exaggerating?\n\nLet’s look at the facts: the left-wing Campus Students’ Collective, instructed by a so-called antagonist far-left group inside and outside the university, decided not to grant Palestinian students the use of the “self-managed” classroom. Left-wing student committees have used this space for decades through an informal agreement between the university and far-left university collectives and the decision was justified by claiming “inadequacy”.\n\nThe final result calls for a straightforward question, the answer to which reveals the historical material relationship: by what prerogative can a collective of left-wing university students use a space for themselves inside the campus and by what prerogative can the same collective, however, not grant it by its own choice to an organisation of young Palestinian students and militants? Is it not precisely because of the unequal and dominating relationship that the West has over the Middle East and Palestine?\n\nREAD: Europe firmly rejects any attempt to change Gaza’s demographics, official says\n\nIntellectual honesty compels us to acknowledge that the judgement of inadequacy effectively summarises an entire cycle of history and the relationship established by a mode of production between Western workers’ class movements towards anti-colonial struggles and the relationship between European and US imperialist nations and the colonised world. We believe history will present (and is already presenting) the final reckoning for this, and Palestine is merely the tip of the iceberg in this historical process.\n\nTo put it briefly: we are at a historical change of phase in the capitalist mode of production where the general development of accumulation of value, even if in a combined and unequal way, grew and maintained a relationship between dominant countries and countries still dominated, and by reflection in the dominant countries tended to consolidate the contradiction between so-called democratic countries and so-called non-democratic countries. For this reason, all the classes of the so-called democratic countries, raised in a cascade thanks to the domination relationship, could rightfully defend “democracy” against the so-called non-democratic countries to be exploited.\n\nToday, that type of relationship is being called into question.\n\nPalestinian resistance cannot have the same forms as Western movements. Therefore, it may not be the type of resistance that “we” like. It doesn’t conform to the material conditions that shaped the workers’ movement and the left in the West. The Western left’s viewpoint, as a social class that exists within the conflictual relationships of a society defined by the commodities market, is expressed through defending the material conditions of democracy in the most powerful nations. These nations have exchanged wealth and resources with the rest of the world, giving in return slavery, racism and war.\n\nMaterial conditions that have defined the oppression of the working classes and their representative parties in the West are linked to 500 years of colonialism, particularly the last 200 years of the turbulent development of liberal and democratic civilisations in European and Western nations. This historical process enabled these classes to gain political influence and the “freedom to fight,” essentially developing class conflict among workers within the democratic sphere.\n\nToday, Palestinian resistance and the rebellion of the peoples of the Sahel seriously challenge the future of peace, freedom and colonialist prosperity in Europe as a historical cycle ends. Simultaneously, the material conditions of the working classes and left-wing parties in Europe and the West are also being challenged.\n\nWhoever in the West refers to communism as an ideal movement must avoid presenting a vision that may have had material reasons before but that vanishes today. This is the historical truth, consequently theoretical, political, and, therefore, practical. This is why corporate parties, thus nationalist and right-wing, are multiplying throughout the West, and the left, as it has developed, is liquefying. It is the same reason why those in the West today are not capable of making a clear and definitive assessment of the historical phase that is something other than the past and are forced to chase the working classes in the West on a nationalist terrain as Sahra Wagenknecht does in Germany, just to name one that seemed in vogue only until a few months ago, and the German workers have preferred the right-wing original of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) to the bad copy of the “left”.\n\nLet’s be clear: it is not about condemning the political will of groups, associations or individual militants for certain behaviours, as, unfortunately, the left was historically accustomed to doing. Instead, it’s about understanding the material reasons for the behaviours of people involved in events such as the episode we are discussing here. We are therefore forced to note that while the mobilisation in support of Palestine to reverse the course of the genocide faces evident difficulty, we also note that the prevention of the presentation of Sinwar’s autobiography by the university is the first real political gain that the Western establishment can claim after 15 months of resistance in Palestine and international mobilisation.\n\nAfter the mobilisations on university campuses failed to hinder universities’ collaboration with Israel and to stop the genocide collaboration, and regardless of whether the reasons for the resistance were silenced and temporarily banned inside one of the most important Italian universities, it means that the reasons for liberal democracy prevailed again, forcing even young, willing leftists to step back.\n\nObviously, we express to the comrades of the Palestinian Student Movement, as well as to the publishing house, our total solidarity against the pro-Zionist political campaign that has also favoured the conditions of their political isolation among the various left-wing and far-left groups. We know well how to distinguish the strength of the dominators, the weakness of the dominated, and the domination of the corruptor over the corrupted. We hope that the Palestinian Student Movement can realise the initiative of presenting the autobiographical book The Thorns and the Carnation by Sinwar, precisely as initially planned with the publishing house and the publisher himself, in any place, if not inside the university, at least in its near vicinity.\n\nWe are prepared to do our part, but not for reasons of democracy or free thought. Instead, we act because addressing the Islamist viewpoint in the resistance against colonialism and the broader crisis of the colonialist system requires fully supporting the needs expressed by this resistance. Therefore, the exact opposite of an opportunistic distancing by alleging idealistic reasons, so that being alongside the Palestinian resistance until victory does not remain as just empty rhetoric and the daughter of a lesser god.\n\nREAD: ‘We’re surprised by the volume of patients in Gaza’\n\nThe views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Monitor.","summary":"This piece provides commentary on how Western liberalism has approached the topic of Yahya Sinwar’s autobiography.

But did you also know he’s quickly becoming the worst poster on Bluesky? It’s true.\n\nCuban shared an AI-generated video on Friday that may rank as the single worst piece of media ever created for an emerging social media platform. And that’s obviously an extremely high bar.\n\nWhat did Cuban share? Well, it’s kind of hard to explain. Imagine the kind of political video that makes absolutely nobody happy and manages to piss off anyone with two brain cells to rub together. Imagine the kind of video that asks the question, “what if fascists are actually our best friends?” Imagine the kind of video that has Elizabeth Warren and Nancy Pelosi in MAGA hats and Donald Trump hugging Barack Obama.\n\nThe video, was sent out by Cuban with the caption “You have to manifest it first ?” and Cuban himself even makes an AI-appearance next to a poorly rendered versions of Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, and Elon Musk. The theme of the video is MAUA, or Make America United Again.\n\nYep, that’s quite a video, isn’t it? Just absolute dogshit wrapped in AI—the aesthetics of fascism at this point. It’s also just not very well made from a technical standpoint.\n\nLike, what the hell is going on here? That’s… Trump?\n\nMark Cuban was embraced by Kamala Harris’s presidential campaign in 2024 as a billionaire who could apparently offer some advice on technology policy, including crypto. And there have been plenty of rumors about how Cuban himself might want to run for president one day. Kara Swisher, the billionaire tech mogul whisperer herself, recently said she thinks it could happen.\n\nBut people who like Cuban as a potential political candidate seem to be living in a very antiquated version of Democratic politics. Cuban is a centrist at a time when extremism has taken root in the Republican Party. So many Democrats seem convinced that Harris’s problem is that she was too extreme, despite the fact that she was campaigning with literal Republicans like Liz Cheney and never shared a stage with the “extreme” lefty candidates like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nCuban has made a transition to Bluesky as some kind of protest against Musk and his connections to Trump, as these guys completely destroy the U.S. government. And yet, Cuban is sharing a video about how it’s great to unite with these fascists. It’s all very confusing.\n\nBut at least some Democrats are joining in the spirit of Cuban’s “Make America United Again” campaign. Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader in the Senate, helped push forward the Republican spending package that keeps the government open. Schumer’s rationale is that if they didn’t let the Republicans have everything they want, Musk would fire a bunch of federal employees, something he’s already been doing.\n\nNo, Schumer’s logic doesn’t make any sense. But at least the Democrats got absolutely nothing in return for giving Trump everything he wanted. In fact, Trump even praised Schumer Friday morning for his support. Way to go, Chuck. You’re really uniting America.","summary":"Hey kids, want to see something terrible?","url":"https://gizmodo.com/mark-cuban-shares-the-dumbest-video-ever-uploaded-to-bluesky-2000576391","image":"https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/03/Mark-Cuban-Jeff-Bezos-Mark-Zuckerberg.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-15 14:20:56","author":"Matt Novak","authors":["Matt Novak"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.179},{"id":300517348,"title":"Trump baselessly accuses news media of ‘illegal’ behavior and corruption in DOJ speech","text":"President Donald Trump launched some of his harshest attacks yet on the media on Friday, using a speech at the Department of Justice to baselessly accuse outlets including CNN of illegal and corrupt behavior.\nIn his Friday speech, Trump praised Florida district court Judge Aileen Cannon, whom he appointed in 2020 and who sided with him in January, blocking the DOJ from sharing a report on Trump’s alleged mishandling of classified documents with members of Congress.\nBut Trump claimed news publishers had gone after Cannon because of the January ruling, alleging “they do it all the time with judges” and that they “will write whatever these people say,” without offering proof.\n“The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal and MSDNC, and the fake news, CNN and ABC, CBS and NBC, they’ll write whatever they say,” Trump said. “And what do you do to get rid of it?

The president’s two federal indictments were brought by Jack Smith, a special counsel appointed in November 2022 by then-Attorney General Merrick Garland. While Garland was appointed by President Joe Biden, that does not prove that Biden was in any way involved in the prosecution or that the former president personally ordered the indictments.\nYet in citing examples of the DOJ’s alleged weaponization against Americans, Trump only brought up issues that affected him directly and popular far-right conspiracy theories, many of which were misleading or have been outright debunked.\nTrump’s speech built on and expanded his history of labeling the press an enemy of the people and the state.\nBut what he really means is that news organizations whose reporting he dislikes may face the wrath of a Justice Department weaponized by the president.\nThat Trump is willing to go after news organizations he dislikes should come as no surprise. The president is currently engaged in a civil lawsuit against the Pulitzer Board over its defending the awarding of the 2018 National Reporting Prize to the Washington Post and the New York Times over their coverage of Russian interference in the 2016 election and its alleged connections to the Trump campaign. In December, ABC News settled a defamation case from Trump for $15 million. And Paramount Global, which owns CBS News, is still fending off a Trump lawsuit over its “60 Minutes” sit-down with former Vice President Kamala Harris.\nThis is to say nothing of the president’s indefinite ban of the Associated Press from the Oval Office and Air Force One over the wire service’s continued use of the term “Gulf of Mexico.”\nCertain agencies under the Trump administration have also signaled that they intend to terminate their subscriptions with mainstream outlets the president dislikes. In February, press secretary Karoline Leavitt announced the White House would end $8 million in Politico Pro subscriptions in response to a far-right conspiracy theory. And, on Friday, NPR reported that the US Agency for Global Media had canceled its AP and AFP contracts, noting that it would also allow its Reuters contract to lapse on March 31.\nBut the president’s Friday speech made clear these are not individual decisions from the White House; they are part of a broader attack on the media — one Trump clearly plans to maintain and even intensify.","summary":"CNN  —  President Donald Trump launched some of his harshest attacks yet on the media on Friday, using a speech at the Department of Justice to baselessly accuse outlets including CNN of illegal and corrupt behavior.

While Garland was appointed by President Joe Biden, that does not prove that Biden was in any way involved in the prosecution or that the former president personally ordered the indictments.\nYet in citing examples of the DOJ’s alleged weaponization against Americans, Trump only brought up issues that affected him directly and popular far-right conspiracy theories, many of which were misleading or have been outright debunked.\nTrump’s speech built on and expanded his history of labeling the press an enemy of the people and the state.\nBut what he really means is that news organizations whose reporting he dislikes may face the wrath of a Justice Department weaponized by the president.\nThat Trump is willing to go after news organizations he dislikes should come as no surprise. The president is currently engaged in a civil lawsuit against the Pulitzer Board over its defending the awarding of the 2018 National Reporting Prize to the Washington Post and the New York Times over their coverage of Russian interference in the 2016 election and its alleged connections to the Trump campaign. In December, ABC News settled a defamation case from Trump for $15 million. And Paramount Global, which owns CBS News, is still fending off a Trump lawsuit over its “60 Minutes” sit-down with former Vice President Kamala Harris.\nThis is to say nothing of the president’s indefinite ban of the Associated Press from the Oval Office and Air Force One over the wire service’s continued use of the term “Gulf of Mexico.”\nCertain agencies under the Trump administration have also signaled that they intend to terminate their subscriptions with mainstream outlets the president dislikes. In February, press secretary Karoline Leavitt announced the White House would end $8 million in Politico Pro subscriptions in response to a far-right conspiracy theory. And, on Friday, NPR reported that the US Agency for Global Media had canceled its AP and AFP contracts, noting that it would also allow its Reuters contract to lapse on March 31.\nBut the president’s Friday speech made clear these are not individual decisions from the White House; they are part of a broader attack on the media — one Trump clearly plans to maintain and even intensify.","summary":"CNN  —  President Donald Trump launched some of his harshest attacks yet on the media on Friday, using a speech at the Department of Justice to baselessly accuse outlets including CNN of illegal and corrupt behavior.

I live in the real world in Pennsylvania, where we have to balance budgets.”\n\nDespite this, Shapiro, often echoing the tone of former President Barack Obama, was quick to express his frustration with Senate Democrats. Specifically, he criticized Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and other top Democrats for their handling of recent negotiations, particularly regarding the GOP’s proposed six-month spending measure aimed at avoiding a government shutdown.\n\n“I would have liked to see when Chuck Schumer had leverage here, to say we need A, B, C, and D for the Democratic Party, and force the Republicans to meet him halfway on those issues and deliver something for the folks who are worried now,” Shapiro told Maher, advocating for a more assertive strategy in negotiations with the GOP.\n\nShapiro later shared an anecdote from a recent trip to a Dick’s Sporting Goods store, where constituents approached him with concerns about the Democratic Party’s lackluster responses to Trump, Elon Musk, and what they see as the erosion of government protections.\n\nWith Trump’s policies, including trade wars with Canada and Mexico, mass civil service firings, and politically motivated detentions, Shapiro has positioned himself as a strong voice of centrist opposition in a time when former leaders like Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, and Joe Biden seem absent from the political stage.\n\n“They’re worried,” Shapiro said, referring to everyday Pennsylvanians who spoke with him in the store. “They want to see action. There was an opportunity for more action here.”\n\nDuring the interview, Maher, who has been vocal in his criticism of MAGA policies, pressed Shapiro on whether the governor’s faith and identity as a Jewish person played a role in him not being chosen as Kamala Harris’ running mate in 2020.\n\n“Look, I’ll just say one quick thing on that whole vice president thing,” Shapiro responded. “I said all along that Kamala Harris had a deeply personal decision to make in that process. In the end, so did I.”\n\nAfter a dramatic pause, Shapiro, a potential 2028 presidential contender, shifted the conversation to his love for serving as governor. “I love being governor of Pennsylvania, and I love charting my own course and being able to serve the people on my terms,” he stated. “That’s point number one. Point number two is, as it relates to faith, as it relates to my Judaism. I’m damn proud of my faith, and I’m damn proud of the people of Pennsylvania, and how they received that.”\n\nHe continued, “I’m inspired every day by the way my outward expression of my faith is received by the people I serve,” emphasizing his pride in his faith and his leadership.\n\nDespite this compelling display, Shapiro declined to confirm whether he’s planning a presidential run in 2028.\n\nMaher, who won’t be on any ballot himself, also used the Friday night episode to lambast Trump, calling him “the Ozempic of the economy” during his opening monologue. He criticized the loss of $5 trillion in market value due to Trump’s erratic tariff policies and the destabilizing impact of Elon Musk’s corporate decisions. Maher also mocked the Republican Party for its subservience to Trump, comparing it to the totalitarianism of North Korea, and criticized MAGA’s economic and diplomatic failures as the former reality TV star returned to power.\n\nIn addition to Shapiro’s interview, Real Time also featured Sam Stein, managing editor of The Bulwark and MSNBC contributor, and Batya Ungar-Sargon, a self-described “MAGA leftist” and author of Second Class: How the Elites Betrayed America’s Working Men and Women.\n\nYou can watch a clip of Maher’s opening monologue from last night’s episode above.","summary":"He also called Trump \"the Ozempic of the economy\" for causing the recent market downturn.","url":"https://decider.com/2025/03/15/bill-maher-almost-gets-josh-shapiro-to-admit-hes-running-for-potus-in-2028-on-real-time/","image":"https://decider.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/bill-maher-031425.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1156","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-15 13:02:19","author":"Michael Haskoor,mliss1578","authors":["Michael Haskoor","mliss1578"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.169},{"id":300494290,"title":"Josh Shapiro tells Maher he's 'damn proud' of being Jewish, dodges whether it factored into VP snub in 2024","text":"Pennsylvania Gov.

We're proud of that,\" Shapiro said. \"You know what happened, Bill, after we ran that ad? I'd show up in some of these rural communities where I might increase the Jewish population by 100% when I showed up there, folks would come over to me and they'd say, 'Hey, I saw your ad. Let me tell you what it's like on Sunday afternoon when I come home from church.' 'Let me tell you what it's like on Christmas Eve.' 'Let me tell you about our Iftar dinners that we have during Ramadan.'\" He continued, \"Folks were more open about it because I showed them truly who I am. I think the American people are a warm people. They are a loving people. I represent the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, founded by William Penn, who literally founded our Commonwealth on the promise of it being warm and welcoming to people of all faiths.

He also attracted the company of opponents to the site of his Bangor County gathering.\n\nHere are 5 takeaways from Vance’s visit to mid-Michigan:\n\nTariff talk\n\nVance‘s visit to Vantage Plastics came during a period of nationwide economic angst, inspired in part by a series of tariffs Trump has threatened and imposed against nations such as Canada and Mexico.\n\nSuch measures threaten the economic stability of American businesses that rely on trade agreements with neighboring allies, opponents of Trump’s policies have argued. Addressing a crowd of workers and politicians inside a Vantage Plastics facility on Friday, Vance defended the president’s strategy.\n\n“You hear people say, ‘Well, how dare Donald Trump impose tariffs on foreign countries that have been taking advantage of us for four years?,’” Vance said. \n\n“And the answer is that, unless you’re willing to use American power to fight back against what those countries have been doing for a generation, you are never going to rebuild American manufacturing.”\n\nThe opposition\n\nDozens of protesters gathered outside Bay County’s UAW Local 362, near Vantage Plastics, to offer a cold welcome for the V.P.\n\nPeople with signs reading “Tariffs hurt USA” and “No Fascists” lined the streets as Vance’s motorcade approached the Bay County site. Many shouted insults and obscenities at the long lineup of Secret Service-led vehicles that pulled into the factory’s parking lot about 11:30 a.m.\n\nKaren Tighe, a former Chair of the Bay County Democratic Party, was there. The 75-year-old said the Trump and Vance administration’s policies represented a threat to federal programs such as Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare. \n\n“It’s personal to us and that’s why we’re here,” Tighe said. “We want him to know that the economic policies of the Trump administration are hurting local people.”\n\nDuring his event inside the facility, Vance delivered a verbal jab, directed at the protesters.\n\n“It’s a little after noon on a Friday: Don’t you all have jobs?,” he said, sparking a round of laughter from the crowd of his supporters indoors. “We want those people to get off the streets and back to work.”\n\nCriticizing the governor\n\nThe vice president seemed to reference Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who met with Trump at the White House one day earlier. The Michigan’s Democratic governor had called the gathering a “productive meeting.”\n\nVance, though, seemed to offer a different view of the meet-up between Trump and Whitmer, political rivals who have exchanged verbal spars over the years.\n\n“It’s kind of funny to see some of our Democratic governors — I don’t want to mention which states exactly — coming to the Oval Office and begging for economic development under Trump’s leadership that they knew they would never get under Biden’s leadership,” Vance said.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nWhitmer and the protesters weren’t the only focus of Vance’s criticism Friday. \n\nIn advocating for the Trump administration’s policies, Vance took shots at the president’s predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden.\n\n“We’re not going to be able to fix everything that Joe Biden broke, but I think, after seven weeks, the progress is pretty good,” Vance said.\n\nThe vice president, though, warned supporters of “a long road ahead” as the Trump administration replaces Biden-era economic policies.\n\n“Last November, America reelected a president with a simple goal: to power our nation’s industrial comeback and‚ once again, make the U.S. the world’s manufacturing superpower,\" Vance said. “And that is exactly what President Trump has sought out to do.”\n\nFamiliar territory\n\nVance’s visit to Michigan Friday marked his first return to Michigan since a busy fall presidential election campaign season, when the Trump and Kamala Harris campaigns visited the state about 80 times in 2024. \n\nVance last visited Michigan during a campaign event at the FIM Capitol Theatre in Flint on the day before Election Day.\n\nWhile Vance campaigned in neighboring Saginaw County last year, Friday represented his first political venture into Bay County.\n\nThe community was pro-Trump territory in November. Bay County favored the Republican ticket in the 2024 presidential election. Trump and Vance received 34,792 votes, compared to 25,767 votes for then-Vice President Harris.","summary":"The former Ohio senator championed the economic policies of President Donald Trump during a 2-hour stay in Michigan this week.","url":"https://www.mlive.com/politics/2025/03/5-takeaways-from-jd-vances-march-visit-to-michigan.html","image":"https://www.mlive.com/resizer/v2/SEE4RU3USJHQBEAQUNFDSQ53FI.JPG?auth=8f1119b00bb6502143a7bff2971f91f352754dc48ad42d31157119d726d3262a&width=1280&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-15 11:41:00","author":"Justin Engel","authors":["Justin Engel"],"language":"en","category":"sports","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.171},{"id":300429894,"title":"DOJ Speech: Trump Labels CNN and MSNBC as “Illegal” for Critical Reporting","text":"Donald Trump once again lashed out at the media, calling CNN and MSNBC “corrupt” and “illegal” for reporting negatively about him.\n\nTrump’s attacks on the media are nothing new, but his choice of venue is: The Justice Department, where, in his campaign-like speech before prosecutors, he also attacked political opponents and called for some to be sent to prison.\n\n“I believe that CNN and MSDNC, who literally write 97.6 percent bad about me, are political arms of the Democrat party, and in my opinion, they are really corrupt and they are illegal,” Trump said, again using his nickname for MSNBC.\n\nHe also bashed other outlets, including CBS, NBC, ABC, The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal, for their reporting. He claimed that the mainstream outlets were influencing judges and “I don’t believe it’s legal.”\n\nMedia outlets are protected by the First Amendment, and their reporting is not illegal. But well before he was elected in November, he talked of retribution against political enemies and critics.\n\nTrump has made attacks on news outlets a primary part of his political persona. But in his second term, his administration has taken steps to try to chill or even intimidate the media. His FCC chairman, Brendan Carr, has launched inquiries into CBS over the way that 60 Minutes edited an interview with Kamala Harris, and of Comcast for its diversity, equity and inclusion policy.\n\nTrump’s White House has banned the Associated Press from Oval Office and other events because the news organization has not changed its Stylebook guidance to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America. The White House also has taken control of who will be members of the press pool, the dozen or so reporters who have access to smaller events with limited capacity. The White House Correspondents’ Association, a non-profit run by journalists, had coordinated the pool for decades.\n\nThe administration also has canceled government subscriptions to news outlets, costing major organizations revenue. On Thursday, Kari Lake, who is serving as senior advisor to the U.S. Agency for Global Media, said that she moved to cancel newswire contracts with The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.\n\nLake wrote on X, “USAGM is an American taxpayer funded News Organization with an 83-year history. We should not be paying outside news companies to tell us what the news is—with nearly a billion-dollar budget, we should be producing news ourselves.” Lake has routinely bashed mainstream media organizations as she waged unsuccessful campaigns for governor and then U.S. senator from Arizona.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nDonald Trump once again lashed out at the media, calling CNN and&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: DOJ Speech: Trump Labels CNN and MSNBC as &#8220;Illegal&#8221; for Critical Reporting first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/doj-speech-trump-labels-cnn-and-msnbc-as-illegal-for-critical-reporting/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ic_launcher.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-15 08:46:49","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.516},{"id":300433194,"title":"Trump says his vow to end Ukraine's war in 24-hours was 'sarcastic'","text":"US President Donald Trump says he was being a “little bit sarcastic” when he repeatedly boasted in his 2024 presidential campaign that he could end the war in Ukraine in a mere 24-hours, and even before taking office.Trump was questioned on his campaign promise during an interview with a US media outlet, as his administration scrambles to broker a solution almost two months into his second term.“Well, I was being a little bit sarcastic when I said that,\" Trump said in a clip released ahead of the episode airing on Sunday. “What I really mean is I’d like to get it settled and, I’ll, I think, I think I’ll be successful.”The statement was a rare admission from Trump, who has a record of making exaggerated claims.Trump said at a CNN town hall in May 2023, “They’re dying, Russians and Ukrainians.

The consequences of his 'erratic' moves","text":"United States President Donald Trump&apos;s policy moves have shocked some world leaders and financial markets — and polling suggests they have impacted his approval at home. There are fears of an escalating trade war , with the Trump administration having imposed tariffs on adversaries and allies — including Australia — and threatened more . They have rattled financial markets and raised concerns the US could be headed for a recession, with Trump having conceded there is likely to be what he called short-term economic pain from his tariffs policy. Also during the first 50 days of his second term, Trump has been criticised for a widely-condemned proposal to \"take over\" Gaza , and for his administration&apos;s handing of peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine , with some accusing him of being friendlier towards Russia which launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine just over three years ago. Domestically, Trump has launched an immigration crackdown , and sought to dramatically cut federal government departments and agencies in concert with billionaire Elon Musk, who leads the controversial so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). So far, the DOGE effort has produced potential cuts of more than 100,000 jobs across the 2.3 million-member federal civilian workforce, the freezing of foreign aid, and the cancellation of thousands of programs and contracts. Rulings in federal courts in California and Maryland on Thursday ordered some agencies to reinstate thousands of probationary employees who had been dismissed in recent weeks. Pollsters say some Americans believe Trump is being too \"erratic\" in his moves to shake up the US economy, and that his \"honeymoon phase\" appears \"to be coming to an end\". John Hart, a US politics expert and a member of the emeritus faculty at the Australian National University, told SBS News he wasn&apos;t surprised Trump&apos;s approval ratings were down. \"The principal impact of Trump&apos;s presidential initiatives so far has been to adversely affect the people who voted for him,\" he said. Hart believes some of his actions have been unpopular with voters, including his \"obsession\" with tariffs and \"sympathetic attitude\" towards Russia in the context of war with Ukraine. \"My guess is that subsequent polls are likely to show that a majority of Americans didn&apos;t like what they saw coming out of the Oval Office,\" he said. Emerson College Polling surveyed 1,000 registered voters over 8-10 March and found Trump had a 47 per cent job approval rating and a 45 per cent disapproval rating — the latter up two points on the week prior. Some 39 per cent of respondents thought the US president was performing better than expected; 36 per cent thought he was doing worse than expected, and 25 per cent said he was performing as expected. This survey asked voters to rank Trump&apos;s handling of several key areas, where he scored best in immigration policy with a 48 per cent approval rating, and worst on the economy, where 48 per cent disapproved of his management. According to Emerson College Polling, respondents expressed scepticism about the US&apos; relationships with its neighbours, with 44 per cent disapproving of Trump&apos;s management of ties with Mexico, and 47 per cent disagreeing with his handling of relations with Canada. Both countries are locked in Trump&apos;s tariff war, and Trump has suggested Canada should become America&apos;s 51st state . \"As President Trump reaches his first 50 days in office, his approval rating has declined from 49 per cent to 41 per cent, to 47 per cent to 45 per cent, reflecting a nation deeply divided,\" said Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling \"While little has shifted since the election, the initial &apos;honeymoon phase&apos; seems to be coming to an end.\" But Hart questioned whether Trump ever experienced a \"honeymoon phase\" to begin with. \"Given the abnormal degree of political polarisation in the US today, I&apos;m not sure Trump had a honeymoon at all,\" he said. Separately, a two-day poll conducted by Reuters/Ipsos, published on Wednesday, found a majority of 1,422 American adults (57 per cent) believe Trump is being too \"erratic\" with his economic moves. Overall, 44 per cent of respondents said they approved of the job Trump was doing as president, unchanged from a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted over 3-4 March. He got particularly weak marks on the issue of the cost of living, where just 32 per cent of respondents approved of his performance. And most of them — 70 per cent including nine in 10 Democrats and six in 10 Republicans — said they expected higher tariffs will make groceries and other regular purchases more expensive. And a CNN poll conducted by market research firm SSRS of about 1,200 voters, released on Wednesday, showed 56 per cent disapproved of Trump&apos;s handling of the economy — a mark worse than at any point during his first term in office, according to the poll. Some 45 per cent approved of his overall performance and 54 per cent disapproved, mirroring his March 2017 numbers and his highest ratings from his first term. If Trump&apos;s approval ratings worsen, Hart said any fallout would be some time off. \"The first opportunity that Americans will get to register their opposition to Trump in a meaningful way will be the mid-term Congressional elections in November 2026,\" Hart said. \"That&apos;s still 20 months away and too far away to threaten Trump right now.\" While voters who wish to express their discontent would have to wait, Trump could shift his attention away from economic uncertainty, focusing more on an area of strength like immigration, Hart said. \"What might happen as a consequence of a worsening economy is that Trump will switch the focus to something else, perhaps back to immigration controls. \"He&apos;s more likely to try to deflect attention from the economy than change his basic approach, which could prove to be the big difference between his first term as president and his second.\" Pollsters found that immigration was a top issue when at the November presidential election, when Trump went up against Democrat Kamala Harris.","summary":"How have Americans rated US President Donald Trump during the first 50 days of his second term?

As Co-Chair of Disney Entertainment, she oversees a vast empire: ABC News, Hulu, Disney+, FX, and the company's powerful TV studios.\n\nAs the highest-ranking woman at Disney, for many insiders she has long been seen as a natural successor to outgoing Iger, who is expected to retire by early 2026.\n\nBut in the era of Trump era 2.0, not even at the most magical place on earth is free from politics. \n\nWalden's cozy ties to Harris are now raising eyebrows in Disney boardrooms and beyond, as fears grow that Trump, known for using his office to punish enemies and corporations, could target Disney if Walden is picked to lead.\n\nFor those who've followed California's Democratic power circles, the Harris-Walden friendship is not news. \n\nThe two women met in 1994, long before Harris would become vice president, and before Walden rose to Disney's top ranks. \n\nBut their bond is a deep and personal one - so personal, in fact, that Harris has credited Walden and her husband, Matt, with setting her up on a blind date with her now-husband, former Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff.\n\nBut their close friendship could become something of a headache for Disney.\n\nWith Trump back in power - and Disney already on the receiving end of Trump's wrath - Walden's closeness to Harris might be seen as something of a vulnerability.\n\nTo say Disney has been running scared from Trump would be an understatement. In the few short months since he won re-election to the White House, Disney has done a number of things to placate Trump. \n\nThey include:\n\n - Paying $15 million to settle a lawsuit with Trump over ABC News coverage - a case some have called a 'presidential bribe' to avoid further wrath.\n\n - Backtracked on DEI (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion) commitments that had drawn the ire of conservative lawmakers.\n\n - Quietly 'de-transed' a transgender character in a Disney+ show following pressure from right-wing activists.\n\n- Scaled back the Snow White premieres, reportedly to dodge media questions about its stars' political controversies - a move that only served to spark more headlines.\n\n'I think board chair James Gorman and his succession committee will go with the candidate they believe will best steer the company well beyond the Trump years,' writes entertainment lawyer Matthew Belloni for Puck. \n\n'If that is ultimately Walden - a big if for many reasons more legitimate than a friendship with a politician - I think she gets the nod on the merits, regardless of the short-term political problems Still, Trump is clearly a major concern, and Walden takes a hit because of that.'\n\nDisney Entertainment insists Walden hasn't hosted a Harris fundraiser since June 2022, when ABC News came under her control, public records tell a fuller story.\n\nThe Waldens have been Harris donors since 2003, back when she was running for San Francisco District Attorney.\n\nIn 2023, Walden personally donated $20,000 to support President Biden and the Democratic Party, according to federal filings. \n\nAnd of course, in 2022 a Brentwood fundraiser for Harris was a star-studded, high-profile display of their alliance.\n\nAll eyes are now on board chair Gorman, tasked with leading the succession committee as the search for Iger's replacement enters its final phase.","summary":"Dana Walden's bid to become Disney's next CEO is facing new scrutiny as political concerns swirl around her.

I think one of the reasons is that when Democrats have been in power, we’ve been timid about passing things that make a difference.”\n\nThe trip to Iowa was the latest sign that Mr. Walz, who was not widely known outside Minnesota before joining Ms. Harris’s ticket, might be contemplating a run for the presidency in 2028.

Once there, astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore will finally be able to return to Earth at some point on or shortly after March 19.\n\nThe pair have been stranded in orbit since June 5, with SpaceX owner Elon Musk and many others claiming Williams and Wilmore were left on the ISS for political reasons. \n\nThe duo were initially scheduled for an eight day mission. \n\nMusk said he offered to bring the astronauts home eight months ago, but the Biden Administration shot it down because it would've made Donald Trump 'look good' in the presidential race against former vice president Kamala Harris. \n\nThe successful takeoff comes after the Crew-10 mission was scrubbed on the launch pad due to mechanical issues just minutes before launch on Wednesday.\n\nCrew-10 includes NASA astronauts Anne McClain and Nichole Ayers, Japan's Takuya Onishi, and Russia's Kirill Peskov.\n\n'Spaceflight is tough, but humans are tougher,' McClain said minutes into the flight. \n\nThe new crew will spend the next six months at the space station, considered the normal stint. \n\nAlongside Williams and Wilmore, NASA's Nick Hague and Russia's Aleksandr Gorbunov will be returning home on board SpaceX's Crew-9 Dragon capsule that is already docked at the ISS.\n\nLast year's presidential race seems to be at the heart of why the astronauts have been stuck in space so long. \n\nMusk backed Trump during the 2024 presidential race, donating $288 million to his campaign and appearing at several MAGA rallies\n\nDuring a recent press briefing, Ken Bowersox, associate administrator of the NASA's Space Operations Mission Directorate, admitted that there 'may have been conversations' in the Biden White House about delaying the return for political optics of having Trump's most famous donor save the day, but he was not part of the discussions.\n\nWednesday's Crew-10 launch was called off due to a hydraulic system issue with the Falcon 9 rocket. NASA said teams were working to address the problem.\n\nNASA had moved up the return mission by two weeks after after President Trump told Musk to 'go get' Williams and Wilmore. \n\nBefore the president's request, the astronauts were not coming back earlier than March 26. \n\n'It's been a roller coaster for them, probably a little bit more so than for us,' Williams said of her family. \n\n'We're here, we have a mission - we're just doing what we do every day, and every day is interesting because we're up in space and it's a lot of fun.' \n\nWhen the new crew arrives aboard the station, Wilmore, Williams, Nick Hague, and Aleksandr Gorbunov can return to Earth in the capsule that has been attached to the station since September.\n\nWilmore and Williams flew to the ISS as the first test crew of Boeing's Starliner, which suffered propulsion system issues in space.\n\nNASA deemed it too risky for the astronauts to fly home on the Boeing craft. This led to the current plan to bring them home in a SpaceX capsule that arrived in September.\n\nThe space agency gave Boeing $4.5 billion contract to develop Starliner in a bid to compete with Musk's SpaceX.\n\nBowersox said that SpaceX 'helped with a lot of options' for bringing Williams and Wilmore back earlier, but the final decision came down to costs.\n\nHe explained that they discussed adding a mission or bringing the currently docked capsule home early, 'but we ruled them out pretty quickly just based on how much money we've got in our budget.' \n\nNASA's budget for the fiscal year 2024 comes in at just under $30 billion.\n\nIt comes after a report found the agency spent millions on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) grants and contracts while Williams and Wilmore have been stuck in space.\n\nBill Gerstenmaier, vice president for SpaceX, also said that NASA's delayed plan allowed the agency 'to use Sunny and Butch in a very productive manner' and 'keep the science going.'\n\nReturning the astronauts early would've meant fewer bodies on the International Space Station (ISS) to continue research.","summary":"The SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket successfully took off Friday night from NASA's Kennedy Space Center, on a mission to deliver four new astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS).","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-14500361/SpaceX-launches-relief-mission-stranded-NASA-astronauts-elon-musk.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/14/23/96214761-0-image-m-25_1741995831571.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/03/05/6695064963204401068/1024x576_MP4_6695064963204401068.mp4","publish_date":"2025-03-14 23:45:39","author":"Chris Melore,Editor","authors":["Chris Melore","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"GB","sentiment":-0.323},{"id":300415212,"title":"Emerging from 2024 loss, Tim Walz holds a town hall in an Iowa Republican’s district","text":"DES MOINES, Iowa — Minnesota Gov.

In theory, when political parties have unified control over the House, the Senate and the presidency, there should be less conflict between them. Because these politicians are part of the same political party and have the same broad goals, it seems like they should be able to get their agenda approved, and the opposing minority party can do little to stop them. \n\nBut not all trifectas are created equal, and not all are dominant. And several weaknesses in the Republicans’ trifecta made passing their six-month stopgap spending bill so difficult, and they help explain why the federal government came so close to shutting down completely.\n\nResearch shows that political gridlock can still happen even under a unified government for reasons that have been on display ever since Republicans assumed leadership of Congress and the presidency in January.\n\nMajority size matters\n\nA unified government clearly makes President Donald Trump’s ability to enact his agenda much easier than if, for example, Democrats controlled the U.S. House, as they did during the second half of his first term, from 2021-2022. But tight margins in both congressional chambers have meant that, even with a trifecta, it hasn’t been an easy. \n\nTrump was the sixth consecutive president with a trifecta on Day 1 of his second term. But history – and simple math – show that presidents with trifectas have an easier time passing partisan legislation with bigger majorities. Bigger majorities mean majority-party defections won’t easily sink controversial or partisan legislation. A bigger majority also means that individual members of Congress from either party have less leverage to water down the president’s policy requests.\n\nTrump also held a trifecta during the beginning of his first term in office; in particular, a big Republican majority in the House, which passed major legislation with relative ease and put pressure on Senate colleagues to comply. Trump signed a major tax reform package in 2017 that was the signature legislative achievement of his first term.\n\nBut Trump has a much smaller advantage this time. \n\nEvery president since Bill Clinton has entered office with a trifecta, but Trump’s seat advantage in the House on Day 1 of his second term was the smallest of all of them. This slim House margin meant that Republicans could afford to lose only a handful of their party’s votes on their spending bill in order for it to pass over unanimous Democratic opposition.\n\nAnd Trump’s relatively small advantage in the Senate meant that Republicans needed at least eight Democratic votes to break a filibuster. Nine Democrats ultimately voted to advance the bill to final passage.\n\nMajority party troubles\n\nIn addition to opposition from Democrats in Congress, Trump and other Republican leaders have continued to confront internal divisions within their own party. \n\nIn a closely divided House or Senate, there are plenty of tools that Democrats, even as the minority party, can use to stymie Trump’s agenda. This most notably includes the filibuster, which would have forced Republicans to garner 60 votes for their short-term spending bill. A small proportion of Democrats ultimately bailed out Senate Republicans in this case; but any major defections within the GOP would have required even more Democratic support, which Republicans were unlikely to get.**\n\nEven dominant legislative trifectas, again like the one former President Barack Obama enjoyed when he took office in 2009, can’t prevent divisions within political parties, as different politicians jockey for control of the party’s agenda. \n\nDespite entering office with a 17-vote advantage in the Senate, 11 more than Trump enjoys now, Obama’s signature legislative achievement – the Affordable Care Act, also sometimes known as Obamacare – had to be watered down significantly to win a simple majority after backlash from conservative Democrats. \n\nObama’s trifecta was bigger in size; but in a polarized America, a large majority also means an ideologically diverse one.\n\nJust as Republican leaders did in the last Congress, Trump has faced similar pushback behind the scenes and in public from members of his own party in his second term. For the past two years, the Republican-led House has been repeatedly riven by leadership struggles and an often aimless legislative agenda, thanks to a lack of cooperation from the the party’s far-right flank. \n\nThis group of ideologically driven lawmakers remains large enough to stall any party-line vote that Speaker Mike Johnson hopes to pass, and the spending bill very nearly fell victim to this kind of defection. \n\nEven though the GOP squeaked out a win on this spending bill, the potential for continued chaos is monumental, especially if Trump pursues more major reform to policy areas such as immigration.\n\nCompeting pressures\n\nDespite Congress’ reputation as a polarized partisan body, members of Congress ultimately serve multiple masters. The lingering Republican divisions that made it so difficult to pass this resolution reflect the competing pressures of national party leaders in Washington and the local politics of each member’s district, which often cut against what party leaders want.\n\nFor example, some Republicans represent heavily Republican districts and will be happy to go along with Trump’s agenda, regardless of how extreme it is. Others represent districts won by Kamala Harris in 2024 and might be more inclined to moderate their positions to keep their seats in 2026 and beyond. There admittedly aren’t many of this latter group; but likely enough to sink any party-line legislation Speaker Johnson has in mind.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nRepublicans managed to pass a hurried, stopgap spending bill on March 14, 2025 only by the skin of their teeth. Failing to do so would have driven the federal government into shutdown mode. Small margins, internal divisions and conflicting electoral pressures will continue to make legislating difficult over the next two years or more.\n\nThanks to these complications, it may be that congressional Republicans will continue to rely on the executive branch, including Elon Musk and the efforts at the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to do the policymaking for them, even if it means handing over their own legislative power to Trump. \n\nThis is an updated version of a story first published on Nov. 19, 2024.","summary":"Without Democratic votes to break a Senate filibuster, the GOP would not have been able to pass its stopgap spending bill and avert a government shutdown.","url":"https://theconversation.com/why-was-it-so-hard-for-the-gop-to-pass-its-spending-bill-252257","image":"https://images.theconversation.com/files/655451/original/file-20250314-56-8cwpv7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=62%2C0%2C5389%2C2694&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-14 22:26:19","author":"Assistant Professor of Political Science,Boise State University,Charlie Hunt","authors":["Assistant Professor of Political Science","Boise State University","Charlie Hunt"],"language":"en","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.161},{"id":300318212,"title":"World News | Trump Pledges to 'expel Rogue Actors' in Political Speech at Justice Department","text":"Washington, Mar 15 (AP) US President Donald Trump used a triumphant visit to the Justice Department on Friday to air a litany of grievances about the criminal investigations that threatened to torpedo his political career, decrying in often profane terms his adversaries and casting himself as a victim of unfair and biased prosecutions. The speech was meant to rally support for Trump's tough-on-crime agenda. But it also functioned as victory lap after he emerged legally and politically unscathed from two federal prosecutions that were dismissed after his election win last fall.

The venue selection for the speech underscores Trump's keen interest in the department and desire to exert influence over it following criminal investigations that shadowed his first four years in office and subsequent campaign. The visit, the first by Trump and the first by any president in a decade, brought him into the belly of an institution he has disparaged in searing terms for years but one that he has sought to reshape by installing loyalists and members of his personal defence team in top leadership positions. \"We will expel the rogue actors and corrupt forces from our government. We will expose, very much expose their egregious crimes and severe misconduct of which was levels never seen anything like it,\" Trump said in a wide-ranging speech that touched on everything from Russia's war against Ukraine to the price of eggs.

And going to also be legendary for the people that are able to seek it out and bring justice. We will restore the scales of justice in America, and we will ensure that such abuses never happen again in our country.\" Although there is some precedent for presidents to speak to the Justice Department workforce from the building's ceremonial Great Hall, Trump's trip two months into his second term was particularly striking because of his unique status as a onetime criminal defendant indicted by the agency he is now poised to address and because his remarks are likely to feature an airing of grievances over his exposure to the criminal justice system -- including an FBI search in 2022 of his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, for classified documents. Trump's visit also comes at a time when Attorney General Pam Bondi has asserted that the department needs to be depoliticised even as critics assert agency leadership is injecting politics into the decision-making process. The relationship between presidents and Justice Department leaders has waxed and waned over the decades depending on the personalities of the officeholders and the sensitivity of the investigations that have dominated the day. The dynamic between President Joe Biden, a Democrat, and his attorney general, Merrick Garland, was known to be fraught in part because of special counsel investigations that Garland oversaw into Biden's mishandling of classified information and into the firearms and tax affairs of his son Hunter. When it comes to setting its agenda, the Justice Department historically takes a cue from the White House but looks to maintain its independence on individual criminal investigations. Trump has upended such norms. He encouraged specific investigations during his first term and tried to engineer the firing of Robert Mueller, the special counsel assigned to investigate ties between Russia and Trump's 2016 campaign. He also endured difficult relationships with his first two handpicked attorneys general -- Jeff Sessions was fired immediately after the 2018 midterm election, and William Barr resigned weeks after publicly disputing Trump's bogus claims of widespread fraud in the 2020 election. Arriving for a second term in January, fresh off a landmark Supreme Court opinion that reaffirmed a president's unshakable control of the Justice Department, Trump has appeared determined to clear from his path any potential obstacles, including by appointing Bondi -- a former Florida attorney general who was part of Trump's defence team at his first impeachment trial -- and Kash Patel, another close ally, to serve as his FBI director. At her January confirmation hearing, Bondi appeared to endorse Trump's false claims of mass voter fraud in 2020 by refusing to answer directly whether Trump had lost to Biden. She also echoed his position that he had been unfairly \"targeted\" by the Justice Department despite the wealth of evidence prosecutors say they amassed. She regularly praises him in Fox News Channel appearances and proudly noted that she had removed portraits of Biden, Garland and Vice President Kamala Harris from a Justice Department wall upon arriving. \"We all adore Donald Trump, and we want to protect him and fight for his agenda. And the people of America overwhelmingly elected him for his agenda,\" Bondi said in a recent Fox interview with Trump's daughter-in-law Lara Trump. Even before Bondi had been confirmed, the Justice Department fired department employees who served on special counsel Jack Smith's team, which charged Trump with plotting to overturn the 2020 election and with hoarding classified documents at Mar-a-Lago. Both cases were dismissed last November in line with longstanding Justice Department policy against indicting sitting presidents. Officials also demanded from the FBI lists of thousands of employees who worked on investigations into the January 6, 2021, riot at the US Capitol, when a mob of Trump's supporters stormed the building in an effort to halt the certification of the electoral vote, and fired prosecutors who had participated in the cases. And they have ordered the dismissal of a criminal case against New York Mayor Eric Adams by saying the charges had handicapped the Democrat's ability to partner in the Republican administration's fight against illegal immigration.

More seasons are on the way, along with a Prime Video documentary and docuseries on first lady Melania Trump. NPR TV critic Eric Deggans is here to talk about Amazon's deals and how the broader TV landscape may be changing during Trump's second term. Hey there.\n\nERIC DEGGANS, BYLINE: Hi.\n\nKELLY: So I need to mention before we get started, Amazon is among NPR's financial supporters. We do cover them like any other company. I will note, Puck News is reporting Amazon is paying 40 million bucks for these shows focused on Melania Trump, which prompts me to ask, is Amazon courting favor with the Trumps?\n\nDEGGANS: Well, certainly that's what some industry watchers, including me, are concerned about, I mean, especially given the way Amazon owner Jeff Bezos kept The Washington Post, which he also owns, from endorsing Trump's opponent Kamala Harris before the 2024 election. Now, Bezos has said he's optimistic about Trump's second term, and Amazon donated $1 million to the president's inaugural fund. We reached out to Amazon about the perception that these deals court favor from the president, but they wouldn't comment beyond what they've already said.\n\nKELLY: Well, and I'll jump in and note, I mean, it's possible, of course, that execs at Amazon just decided, look, the election proves there's a lot of interest in Donald and Melania Trump. Let's have some more TV projects about them.\n\nDEGGANS: Absolutely. But it's also quite a turnaround from 2015, when NBC severed ties with Trump following his derogatory comments about Mexican immigrants when he announced his first candidacy for president.\n\nKELLY: OK, fair. So Amazon clearly sees a market out there for Melania Trump, for \"The Apprentice.\" Is this playing out, Eric, beyond Amazon? Talk to me about whether we're seeing a broader shift here.\n\nDEGGANS: I think there are more projects coming to television that target an audience that might be considered Trump-friendly. The Wall Street Journal's Joe Flint had a great story noting the success of Tim Allen's new ABC show \"Shifting Gears,\" which features the comic as a gruff owner of a car restoration business. Now, Tim Allen is publicly conservative, and his character listens to Joe Rogan's podcast. And the A&E channel announced the return of \"Duck Dynasty,\" which is an unscripted show with stars who have appeared at Trump rallies. And Netflix also recently announced a deal with comic Tony Hinchcliffe, who called Puerto Rico, quote, \"a floating island of garbage\" during a rally for Trump in October.\n\nKELLY: Oh, yeah.\n\nDEGGANS: But some of these projects have been in the works for a while. I mean, ABC announced it was making a pilot for Allen's show about a year ago. So this could be a combination of TV programmers creating material for an audience they see expressing itself more prominently and a way of courting President Trump and the people who support him.\n\nKELLY: Are there are other things going on, Eric? - other trends that might also be informing these programming decisions?\n\nDEGGANS: For sure. I'm seeing more shows focused on Western culture, rural culture, country music - parts of pop culture championed by some conservatives. I think the success of the Western-themed TV drama \"Yellowstone\" inspired copycats, like a new drama coming on Netflix about Texas ranchers, \"Ransom Canyon.\" And Netflix also has been courting comics from the podcast \"Manosphere\" for a while, with recent specials from Andrew Schulz and Bert Kreischer.\n\nKELLY: It's interesting because it's such a contrast from these last few years, when Hollywood was championing projects that captured diversity in America. Are those projects likely to be sidelined?\n\nDEGGANS: Well, certainly that's the fear. I mean, it takes a while to make some movies and TV shows, so we're still seeing new projects with strong racial diversity components, like a version of \"Snow White\" starring Rachel Zegler, who is Latina. But we're also seeing lots of companies roll back their diversity and inclusion efforts following these anti-DEI executive orders from President Trump, including at PBS and Disney. Many Hollywood studios and TV networks created high-level diversity positions years ago because representation was so bad. With these rollbacks, there's serious concern we'll see the same old problems resurface that it took 20 years to overcome in the first place.\n\nKELLY: NPR's TV critic Eric Deggans, thank you.\n\nDEGGANS: Thank you.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nCopyright © 2025 NPR.

The speech was meant to rally support for Trump's tough-on-crime agenda. But it also functioned as victory lap after he emerged legally and politically unscathed from two federal prosecutions that were dismissed after his election win last fall. The venue selection for the speech underscores Trump's keen interest in the department and desire to exert influence over it following criminal investigations that shadowed his first four years in office and subsequent campaign. The visit, the first by Trump and the first by any president in a decade, brought him into the belly of an institution he has disparaged in searing terms for years but one that he has sought to reshape by installing loyalists and members of his personal defense team in top leadership positions. “We will expel the rogue actors and corrupt forces from our government. We will expose, very much expose their egregious crimes and severe misconduct of which was levels never seen anything like it,\" Trump said in a wide-ranging speech that touched on topics including Russia's war against Ukraine and the price of eggs. \"It’s going to be legendary. And going to also be legendary for the people that are able to seek it out and bring justice. We will restore the scales of justice in America, and we will ensure that such abuses never happen again in our country.” Although there is some precedent for presidents to speak to the Justice Department workforce from the building's ceremonial Great Hall, Trump's trip two months into his second term was particularly striking because of his unique status as a onetime criminal defendant indicted by the agency he is now poised to address and because his remarks are likely to feature an airing of grievances over his exposure to the criminal justice system — including an FBI search in 2022 of his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla., for classified documents. Trump's visit also comes at a time when Atty. Gen. Pam Bondi has asserted that the department needs to be depoliticized even as critics assert agency leadership is injecting politics into the decision-making process. The relationship between presidents and Justice Department leaders has waxed and waned over the decades depending on the personalities of the officeholders and the sensitivity of the investigations that have dominated the day. The dynamic between President Biden, a Democrat, and his attorney general, Merrick Garland, was known to be fraught in part because of special counsel investigations that Garland oversaw into Biden's mishandling of classified information and into the firearms and tax affairs of his son Hunter. When it comes to setting its agenda, the Justice Department historically takes a cue from the White House but looks to maintain its independence on individual criminal investigations. Trump has upended such norms. He encouraged specific investigations during his first term and tried to engineer the firing of Robert Mueller, the special counsel assigned to investigate ties between Russia and Trump's 2016 campaign. He also endured difficult relationships with his first two handpicked attorneys general — Jeff Sessions was fired immediately after the 2018 midterm election, and William Barr resigned weeks after publicly disputing Trump's bogus claims of widespread fraud in the 2020 election. Arriving for a second term in January fresh off a landmark Supreme Court opinion that reaffirmed a president's unshakable control of the Justice Department, Trump has appeared determined to clear from his path any potential obstacles, including by appointing Bondi — a former Florida attorney general who was part of Trump’s defense team at his first impeachment trial — and Kash Patel, another close ally, to serve as his FBI director. At her January confirmation hearing, Bondi appeared to endorse Trump's false claims of mass voter fraud in 2020 by refusing to answer directly whether Trump had lost to Biden. She also echoed his position that he had been unfairly “targeted” by the Justice Department despite the wealth of evidence prosecutors say they amassed. She regularly praises him in Fox News Channel appearances and proudly noted that she had removed portraits of Biden, Garland and Vice President Kamala Harris from a Justice Department wall upon arriving. “We all adore Donald Trump, and we want to protect him and fight for his agenda. And the people of America overwhelmingly elected him for his agenda,” Bondi said in a recent Fox interview with Trump's daughter-in-law, Lara Trump. Even before Bondi had been confirmed, the Justice Department fired department employees who served on special counsel Jack Smith's team, which charged Trump with plotting to overturn the 2020 election and with hoarding classified documents at Mar-a-Lago. Both cases were dismissed last November in line with longstanding Justice Department policy against indicting sitting presidents. Officials also demanded from the FBI lists of thousands of employees who worked on investigations into the Jan 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol, when a mob of Trump's supporters stormed the building in an effort to halt the certification of the electoral vote, and fired prosecutors who had participated in the cases. And they've ordered the dismissal of a criminal case against New York Mayor Eric Adams by saying the charges had handicapped the Democrat’s ability to partner in the Republican administration’s fight against illegal immigration.
