With nearly a full year as president under his belt, Trump is battling a public perception that he is doing little to nothing to bring down prices for Americans, while economists blame his tariffs agenda for hiking many of those costs even further.\n\nWith approval polls showing his overall averages sinking, Trump is now mired in unpopularity as the swing voters who went red in 2024 desert him in droves. Driving that flight: Views of his ability to handle the economy, which have plunged over 2025, and the response to his refusal to release the so-called Jeffrey Epstein files.\n\nEpstein is proving to have a salience with Americans that very few other issues have, defying many so-called political experts who once dissuaded Democrats from focusing time and attention on the late sex offender and his alleged ties to powerful figures.\n\nThe Trump administration’s refusal to release documents surrounding the Epstein investigations drew instant accusations of a cover-up from within the broader MAGA sphere almost instantly.\n\nMonths later and the administration’s stonewalling, evolving excuses and furious attacks targeting Trump’s own voters for their interest in the files has only caused that problem to grow exponentially.\n\nNow, in the famously unruly House Republican caucus, the first signs of real resistance to Trump’s pressure and influence campaigns are coming into focus.\n\nFour Republican members of Congress signed on to a discharge petition backed by every Democratic member of the chamber aimed at forcing the administration to release its files on the Epstein investigation. Withstanding Trump’s entreaties and outright threats, Reps. Thomas Massie, Marjorie Taylor Greene, Nancy Mace and Lauren Boebert have vowed that they will not buckle under any calls from House leadership — or the president — to stop seeking justice for Epstein’s victims.\n\nIf this sounds weirdly familiar, it should: Congress has a rich history of card-carrying Democrats and Republicans who form their entire political brands around being independents within the system, often bucking leadership as often or more than real independents like Sens. Bernie Sanders and Angus King in the Senate.\n\nThroughout Joe Biden’s administration, Democrats fumed as two of their own — Sens. Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema — sunk the Build Back Better agenda while vowing to rein in their party when they thought it mattered. Among Republicans there are still figures like former Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who won re-election in 2018 and lost a Senate campaign in 2024, both times running on a platform of staunch opposition to Trump and Trumpism’s effects withing the GOP.\n\nBut in the GOP, those voices largely died out before the end of the first Trump era. They’ve been even less prevalent in the present day, as Trump and allies like Laura Loomer have furiously purged disloyal administration appointees, nominees and staffers while the president cultivates a record for punishing his enemies and richly rewarding those who bend the knee, even former enemies.\n\nA new kind of independent Republican voice could be emerging, though, with its roots in the cracks in the MAGA base caused by Trump’s response to calls to release the Epstein files. Those calls were re-energized this past week as the House returned to Washington, the discharge petition to release the files hit the required 218 signatures for a vote, and a new batch of emails were released from Jeffrey Epstein’s estate where the convicted pedophile claims that Trump “knew about the girls.”\n\nTrump and the White House denied claims made by Epstein.\n\nTrump’s hemorrhaging on the Epstein issue creates an opening for resistance to blossom once again within the GOP. But Greene has made it clear there is growing daylight between herself and the president to whom she was once unquestioningly loyal.\n\n\"What the American people voted for with MAGA was to put the American people first,” said Greene Sunday on CNN’s State of the Union.\n\n“Stop sending foreign aid, and stop being involved in foreign wars... they very much deserve to be put first. Cost of living is far too high. Health insurance is completely out of control,” she said. “Those are two issues I’ve been very vocal on for months and months now, long before Republicans were shocked when those big losses came on this past Tuesday’s election.”\n\nCNN’s Dana Bash responded: \"Sounds like you are saying that he is not representing the MAGA movement that he started?\"\n\n\"Promoting H-1B visas to replace American jobs, bringing in 600,000 Chinese students to replace American students’ opportunities in American colleges and universities; those are not America first positions,” said Greene. “Continuing to, really, travel all over the world doesn’t help Americans back at home.”\n\nGreene added that Trump should “park” Air Force One back in Washington., D.C., and drill down on domestic issues like inflation and health care costs.\n\n“Nothing but a constant focus in the White House on a domestic agenda,” she said.\n\nWith Trump now a lame duck president, the Republican Party is quickly going to have to become accustomed to a new reality: Trump will never be at the top of a presidential ticket again, and there are signs that his influence is no longer translating into GOP turnout in off-year elections.\n\nRepublicans had a dismal showing in the 2022 midterm season, with an expected “red wave” never materializing. The gains made by the party amid Joe Biden and Kamala Harris’s collapse last year could be erased in cycles to come.\n\nAnd if his poll numbers continue to sag past some of their lowest recorded points in the Trump era, the president may end up seeing an early succession battle for the face of America First.","summary":"Trump is giving House Republicans an unprecedented opportunity to safely stake out positions apart from his own as the battle for the MAGA mantle begins, writes John Bowden","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/massie-greene-epstein-trump-republicans-b2866347.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/11/15/2/48/SEI274394075.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/x6q7Jlad-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-11-16 23:22:48","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.148},{"id":379644150,"title":"Left-wing activist Jesse Jackson now on a form of life support after hospitalization","text":"The report added that Jackson has shown some signs of responsiveness to medication, but had a significant drop in blood pressure on Saturday night. \n\nJackson is a well-known figure on the Left, particularly for his activism.

Khanna details ‘final straw’ involving ‘out of touch’ Schumer","text":"WASHINGTON — Lefty California Rep. Ro Khanna on Sunday detailed why it’s time to finally chuck Chuck. \n\nThe Dem congressman said the failed tactics of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) during the government shutdown were the “final straw” and urged his party to find new leadership for the upper chamber, despite some of his colleagues railing against the Democratic infighting.\n\n“[Schumer] doesn’t inspire confidence. He’s not bold. He’s out of touch with the grassroots. He’s someone who cheer led us into the war in Iraq. He doesn’t have the moral clarity on Gaza. He couldn’t say [New York City Mayor-elect Zohran] Mamdani’s name,” Khanna told NBC’s “Meet the Press.”\n\n“This was the final straw, where he was not strong on fighting for health care,” he said of Schumer’s leadership, or lack thereof, during the Dems’ shutdown battle with the Trump administration.\n\nKhanna, who has been one of the loudest Democratic voices in Congress demanding Schumer be replaced as the party’s Senate chief, credited him for being a “terrific” leader during the Democratic Biden era.\n\n“I worked with him on the CHIPS and Science Act. That would not have passed if it weren’t for Senator Schumer’s leadership. Same with the infrastructure bill and IRA [Inflation Reduction Act],” Khanna said.\n\nAs for the recent historic federal shutdown, Schumer did not waiver and voted against the bipartisan deal to reopen the government.\n\nBut Khanna and other progressive reps faulted him for failing to prevent the party defections that allowed the shutdown to end without the party getting the concessions it demanded. \n\nSchumer had already previously refused to block a GOP-backed bill to prevent a government shutdown in March, much to the chagrin of his left flank.\n\n“Chris Murphy is a top leader. Cory Booker is a dynamic leader. Brian Schatz is a dynamic leader. I mean, Elizabeth Warren is someone whose ideology I appreciate. There are a lot of great talent,” Khanna said when asked for the party’s top Senate names.\n\nThus far, no sitting senator has called on Schumer to step aside, while Democratic candidates for the Senate from Maine and Iowa have expressed support for replacing him. \n\nA source who advised Kamala Harris’s presidential campaign snipped of Khanna, “You cannot spell rookie without ‘Ro.’ \n\n“There’s a running joke about him in the halls: He’s chairman of the eye-roll caucus,” the source said.\n\nSen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), who was one of the five Democratic flips to reopen the government, also insisted on “Meet the Press” on Sunday that”Chuck has been an effective leader.\n\nKaine further chided that critics such as Khanna should “focus on their own leadership and let senators do what we need to do to keep this country moving forward.”\n\nFormer Obama White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel, who has been flirting with a 2028 presidential run, urged Democrats to get past the infighting.\n\n“Chuck Schumer is not the problem. Donald Trump and the rubber-stamp Republicans are the problem. Keep your eye on the prize. Focus on what’s important,” he told CNN’s “State of the Union.”\n\n“Nobody does a firing squad in a circle like the Democratic Party.”\n\nEmanuel said he actually wouldn’t have backed the shutdown, noting that historically, “The party that forces … a government shutdown over a policy has lost both.”","summary":"\"Chris Murphy is a top leader.

Trump said Friday he was planning to sue the BBC for up to $5 billion over a network documentary's misleading edit of his remarks on Jan. 6, 2021. A similar edit was found on the network's \"Newsnight\" program in 2022. While the amount is eye-popping, Trump has managed to score large settlements from CBS, ABC and Meta over the past 12 months. To Trump allies, it's well-deserved for their malign behavior against Trump, while to his detractors, it's no better than ransom money or bribes to the most powerful person on the planet. Trump's settlements with Paramount-owned CBS and Disney-owned ABC over his respective suits touched off a firestorm of liberal criticism that their parent companies were wilting to administration pressure and selling out their own journalists. ROGAN REBUKES OUSTED BBC EXECUTIVES, CLAIMS THE NETWORK 'FELT JUSTIFIED IN COMPLETELY LYING' ABOUT TRUMP Paramount Global and CBS agreed in July to pay a $16 million upfront sum to settle the president’s lawsuit against the network over how \"60 Minutes\" edited and released an interview with then-Democratic rival Kamala Harris in 2024. Trump’s team, which initially sought $10 billion, claimed the network’s use of edited clips from a single response about Israel constituted \"election interference.\" The same month as the settlement, the Trump administration's Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved an $8 billion merger between Paramount and Skydance Media, leading figures like CBS late-night host Stephen Colbert, a fierce Trump critic, to say the settlement was essentially a \"big fat bribe.\" Trump's legal team championed the settlement as a win for media accountability and the American people. \"With this record settlement, President Donald J. Trump delivers another win for the American people as he, once again, holds the Fake News media accountable for their wrongdoing and deceit,\" a spokesperson for Trump’s legal team told Fox News Digital at the time. BBC APOLOGIZES TO TRUMP AMID $1 BILLION LEGAL THREAT That win came on the heels of ABC's apology and $16 million settlement with Trump last December after he sued for defamation over \"This Week\" anchor George Stephanopoulos' claims on the air that the president had been held \"liable for rape.\" The jury in the E. Jean Carroll case to which he was referring had actually ruled he was liable for \"sexual abuse.\" In addition, Trump's team has won nearly a combined $60 million in settlements from X, Meta and Alphabet-owned YouTube this year over his prior account suspensions by the respective tech giants in the aftermath of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. Shortly after Trump took office again in January, Meta settled with Trump for $25 million over his account suspensions on its platforms in 2021. X, owned by off-and-on ally Elon Musk, agreed in February to pay about $10 million to settle Trump's lawsuit after he was banned from Twitter in 2021. Musk reinstated Trump's account when he bought Twitter, now known as X, in November 2022. In September, Trump won a $24.5 million settlement from YouTube over the platform’s suspension of his account. According to a court filing obtained by Fox News Digital, $22 million of the settlement was to be contributed on Trump’s behalf to the Trust for the National Mall, a nonprofit supporting construction of the new White House State Ballroom. OPINION: BBC CAUGHT TWISTING TRUMP'S WORDS, AND US MEDIA RUSH TO THEIR DEFENSE Trump told reporters on Friday he will sue the BBC this week for somewhere between $1 billion and $5 billion, after a Panorama documentary from the network edited together remarks he made on Jan. 6, 2021. The network later apologized and admitted it \"gave the mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action,\" although it contested the notion it had defamed Trump. The edit made it seem like Trump uttered a single thought about supporters going down to the Capitol, \"cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women, and we fight, we fight like hell.\" In reality, those remarks came nearly an hour later in his lengthy address that day. His full remarks were, \"We're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women, and we're probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them. Because you'll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength, and you have to be strong. We have come to demand that Congress do the right thing and only count the electors who have been lawfully slated, lawfully slated. I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.\" TRUMP ANNOUNCES $15 BILLION LAWSUIT AGAINST THE NEW YORK TIMES FOR DEFAMATION, LIBEL Near the end of his speech, which lasted for over an hour, he said, \"And we fight. We fight like hell. And if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore.\" The controversy has already led to the resignations of BBC News CEO Deborah Turness and BBC director-general Tim Davie. It's also not the only legal action Trump has going on against a major media outlet. Trump refiled a $15 billion lawsuit against The New York Times last month, alleging defamation pertaining to The Times' reporting on Trump's stint as star of \"The Apprentice\" and allegations he engaged in suspect tax maneuvers. The suit named individual Times reporters and Penguin Random House, the publisher of the book, \"Lucky Loser,\" by reporters Susanne Craig, Russ Buettner. \"As we said when this was first filed and again after the judge’s ruling to strike it: this lawsuit has no merit. Nothing has changed today,\" a Times spokesperson told Fox News Digital last month. \"This is merely an attempt to stifle independent reporting and generate PR attention, but The New York Times will not be deterred by intimidation tactics.\" A Penguin Random House spokesperson told Fox News Digital: \"With a second attempt, this lawsuit remains meritless. Penguin Random House will continue to stand by the book and its authors just as we will continue to stand for the important fundamental principles of the First Amendment.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP","summary":"President Donald Trump has said he&apos;ll sue the BBC for up to $5 billion, and he comes with a track record of high-figure settlements from media companies.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/trumps-5-billion-lawsuit-threat-against-bbc-comes-amid-spate-legal-wins-over-media-companies","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/08/donald-trump-photo-1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-16 19:55:25","author":"David Rutz","authors":["David Rutz"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.046},{"id":379621504,"title":"Why the Royal Complaints of a Former First Lady Still Get Treated as Serious Thought","text":"Building on her familiar language of grievance, Michelle Obama's latest remarks continue her trend of proclaiming victimhood despite receiving treatment that royals receive and delivered from a platform only a handful of Americans will ever stand on.\n\nI really do wish this person would move back to Chicago or one of the other two of her mansions, and live out retirement in a peaceful and, most importantly, QUIET, safe, and secure environment among her sycophants. But the lady has a book to sell and has an ego rivaling her husband's.\n\nRelated: Pampered First Lady, Perpetual Victim Complex\n\nUsing a line meant to sting, yet spoken by someone who has lived closer to royalty than to any struggle she's perceived to have lived through, Obama claimed the country \"isn't ready for a woman\" to serve as president.\n\nFormer First Lady Michelle Obama proclaimed that Americans are “not ready” for a woman president, arguing, “we’ve got a lot of growing up to do.Reflecting on Kamala Harris’s unsuccessful presidential campaign, Michelle Obama pointed to gender, rather than policy, as the key factor behind the loss.“As we saw in this past election, sadly, we ain’t ready,” Obama stated during a conversation with actor Tracee Ellis Ross at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.“That’s why I’m like, don’t even look at me about running, because you all are lying. You’re not ready for a woman. You are not,” she explained.“You know, we’ve got a lot of growing up to do, and there’s still, safely, a lot of men who do not feel like a woman can lead them, and we saw it.”Obama’s comments came while promoting her new book titled “The Look,” which details her approach to fashion during her time as the first lady.\n\nThe only thing more repugnant than her attitude is the reflexive reverence from the drive-by media, with every word sailing past every filter, treated as profound insights rather than what they really are: royal complaints from someone who hasn't been told \"No!\" in a very long time.\n\nThe Privilege Behind the Scolding\n\nMichelle Obama has spent decades cocooned in acclaim: private schools, elite universities, the comforts of power, a mansion in Martha's Vineyard, and the White House experience that transformed her from a prominent Chicago attorney into a global celebrity.\n\nIt's not easy to reconcile that level of privilege with the moral lecture she delivered in Brooklyn, but Obama makes it look so easy. When a person steeped in influence tells the public to \"grow up,\" the message loses credibility. The lesson she needs to learn, but refuses to, is that you can't scold from the top of the palace steps and expect the village to nod along.\n\nHer Claim and the Disconnect\n\nDuring her Brooklyn Academy of Music appearance, Obama said men still aren't ready for a woman in the Oval Office, framing her statement as honest frustration, yet delivering it with a strangely aloof posture.\n\nShe has no intention of running into the arena she critiques. She delivered an odd kind of sermon, demanding transformation from people she refuses to stand shoulder to shoulder with. It's a disconnect that reveals more about her than about the electorate she pretends to diagnose.\n\nA Rising Tone of Umbrage\n\nThe sense of umbrage in her recent comments mirrors a pattern; each appearance feels more like an admonition than a conversation.\n\nRelated: Michelle Obama Is an Insufferable Racist\n\nObama lamented how Americans view her hair (!?), urging a cultural education on black beauty.\n\nAt one point in the conversation, Obama discussed the struggle Black Americans have in straightening their hair to “follow” White beauty standards, asking, “Why do we need an act of law to tell White folk to get outta our hair?”“Let me explain something to White people,” she began. “Our hair comes out of our head naturally in a curly pattern, so when we’re straightening it to follow your beauty standards, we are trapped by the straightness.”“That’s why so many of us can’t swim, and we run away from the water. People won’t go to the gym because we’re trying to keep our hair straight for y’all,” she added.\n\nShe's found fault in everything from national expectations to personal aesthetics, culminating in an effect of a former First Lady portraying herself as a misunderstood visionary, while sitting on a throne cushioned by wealth, fame, and absolute deference.\n\nIt's unearned martyrdom disguised as insight.\n\nA Press Corps that Never Pushes Back\n\nIf our press corps brought skepticism and scrutiny along with their fawning interviews, none of this would carry weight. Reporters dutifully transcribed her words and framed them as cultural wisdom.\n\nNot bloody once did anyone ask why millions of Americans are immature while refusing to enter the political arena. Nobody questioned why the wealthiest, most insulated woman in modern American politics keeps presenting herself as a victim of societal backwardness. The media treats her remarks with the seriousness reserved for prophets, not a petulant, pampered elite.\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nWhen speaking from pedestals, cultural elites shape public perception, while the danger lies in mistaking pedestal height for moral authority. Treating her highness's royal complaints as serious thought widens the disconnect between Americans and those who claim to speak for them.\n\nMichelle Obama can criticize the electorate all she wants, but the rest of us aren't required to confuse her grievance with wisdom. Power without accountability breeds distortion, and too many in the media have forgotten their role.\n\nAlthough it's hard to listen to Obama's constant march towards martyrdom, as a society, we are required to mark her words and thoughts down so history receives a complete picture of a narcissistic husband and wife who think they're more significant than sliced bread.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nOne thing Michelle Obama isn't wrong about is that our country is divided, weary, and cynical, but she's wrong about the source. Americans aren't failing to grow up; we're tired of being lectured by elites who believe their societal elevation grants them insights.\n\nHer latest sermon reveals something relatively simple: she still expects a nation to bow, even after walking off the stage.\n\nRespect is earned, not inherited from the trappings of one's former office.\n\nWhen you subscribe to PJ Media, you get more than commentary.

This time, her target was our supposed inability to elect a woman president, which she blamed for Kamala Harris' humiliating loss to Donald Trump last year. Speaking to a crowd of women, the former first lady declared, \"As we saw in this past election, sadly, we ain't ready.\"\n\nShe added, \"That's why I'm like, don't even look at me about running, because you all are lying. You're not ready for a woman. You are not.\"\n\nAccording to Michelle, men in this country are too intimidated to be led by a woman. \"You know, we've got a lot of growing up to do, and there's still, sadly, a lot of men who do not feel like they can be led by a woman, and we saw it,\" she said.\n\nThis comes from someone who has spent years complaining about how hard it was being the first black woman to serve as first lady, even though the media fawned over her at every turn. She claims women in politics are judged on their physical appearance rather than their ability to lead, conveniently forgetting that she was treated like royalty by the press during her husband's presidency.\n\nICYMI: Michelle Obama Is an Insufferable Racist \n\nMichelle has spent her book tour whining about how her appearance was constantly dissected during her time in the White House. \"During our family's time in the White House, the way I looked was constantly being dissected—what I wore, how my hair was styled. For a while now, I've been wanting to reclaim more of that story, to share it in my own way. I'm thankful to be at a stage in life where I feel comfortable expressing myself freely—wearing what I love and doing what feels true to me. And I'm excited to share some of what I've learned along the way,\" she said.\n\nBut here's the thing: her claims are easily disproven.\n\nIn 2008, the McCain-Palin ticket received 59,948,323 votes, and much of the enthusiasm for that ticket was because of Palin, not McCain. In 2016, Hillary Clinton won the popular vote with over 65 million votes. Kamala Harris, despite being one of the most inept candidates in modern history, got roughly 75 million votes, the fourth-most votes of any presidential candidate in U.S. history, the most by any woman, and the second-most by any Democrat, ever. She won about 5.5 million more votes in 2008 than Barack Obama, who received 69 million votes, nearly 9 million more votes than Obama in 2012, and more than 12 million more votes than Donald Trump in 2016.\n\nMichelle Obama was merely perpetuating the narrative that the only reason Kamala Harris lost was sexism, ignoring the fact that she was a terrible candidate, saddled with the appalling record of the Biden-Harris administration. Millions of Americans from both parties have voted for women candidates on a national ticket. The problem isn't that Americans aren't ready for a woman president. The problem is that the right candidate hasn't run yet. Harris lost because she was incompetent, not because she was a woman. But that reality doesn't fit the victim narrative Obama and her allies prefer to push.","url":"https://pjmedia.com/matt-margolis/2025/11/16/michelle-obama-hates-america-n4946059","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/182/f5ea9860-416d-4a5e-a58d-893632883a39.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-16 18:45:38","author":"Matt Margolis","authors":["Matt Margolis"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.194},{"id":379598160,"title":"BBC licence fee payers could be protected from Trump payout by insurers","text":"Donald Trump’s vow while aboard Air Force One this weekend to sue the BBC for up to $5bn raised the question of how the Corporation could fund a swingeing financial settlement with the litigious President. \n\nThe Beeb has made clear that, for all its regret at the editing process in the Panorama documentary which led to the resignations of director general Tim Davie and head of news Deborah Turness, it “strongly disagrees” that Trump has grounds to claim defamation against it.\n\nIt argues that it owes him nothing in terms of financial damages. \n\nThe US President says the broadcaster has wronged him in its portrayal of his speech to supporters ahead of the storming of the Capitol building in 2021.\n\nDespite an apology for an “error of judgment” issued last week by the BBC, Trump has vowed that he will pursue the BBC for “anywhere between $1bn and $5bn, probably sometime next week”. \n\nHe told GB News on Saturday: “I’m not looking to get into lawsuits.

Smith raises suspicion on Donald Trump's link in Epstein files, drags Charlie Kirk into debate","text":"ESPN analyst Stephen A. Smith has raised suspicions about U.S. President Donald Trump and his link with the Epstein files. On Thursday, Democrats and a handful of Republicans reached 218 signatures to force a floor vote on a bill to release the Epstein files — documents related to criminal charges of sex trafficking brought against the late convicted Jeffrey Epstein — within 30 days.Smith offered his take on Trump's alleged connection with the Epstein files on his YouTube show on Saturday.\"It's very, very difficult to believe that somebody could be associated with Epstein in any way and not get mentioned, if you're a prominent figure,\" Stephen A. Smith said. \"Now, what you deduce from that in terms of guilt or innocence is for you to do. We ain't trying to get sued, we ain't doing that. But what we will tell you that it's not a surprise to hear Trump's name in the mix. The question is: is it to protect himself or to protect well-known public fugures?\"We have a right to ask that question because the left is in on it now. But MAGA right was in on it, because unlike Kamala Harris, Joe Biden, or anybody else, Trump campaigned on a release of the Epstein files. ... So, to then get into office and to suddenly walk around like he did months to go talk about 'what's the big deal? This is not a real story, we're not touching on this,' seemed very, very suspicious, which riled up some members of his base, who felt betrayed by Donald Trump.\"Stephen A. Smith also name-dropped the late Charlie Kirk, a right-wing political activist, who was assassinated on Sept. 10.\"This ain't just the left coming after him, this is the right wanting those files released,\" Smith said. \" And if we're being totally transparent here, one of those people was Charlie Kirk. I'm making no connection to his assassination... I'm just bringing him up because he was a prominent name, who was a prominent supporter of the President, who spent an inordinate amount of time bringing up the fact that those Epstein files needed to be released.\"Earlier this week, Smith slammed the Democrats for releasing new Epstein files now when they could have done so four years ago, when Joe Biden was president.Stephen A.

In July 2025, CBS/Paramount settled for $16 million over deceptively edited “60 Minutes” footage of Kamala Harris, marking a major win against manipulative reporting.\n\nSimilarly, ABC agreed to a $15 million donation to Trump’s presidential library in December 2024 to resolve defamation claims from George Stephanopoulos’s on-air accusations. \n\nThese settlements expose the leftist media’s agenda of biased editing and smears, forcing outlets to rethink their anti-Trump narratives or face financial ruin. \n\nBeyond these, recent cases abound. Trump filed a $15 billion suit against The New York Times in September for alleged defamation, prompting the paper to issue clarifications in subsequent stories.\n\nIn July, he sued The Wall Street Journal for $10 billion over similar claims, leading to heightened editorial scrutiny. \n\nNPR and PBS have also faced threats, with insiders reporting “tiptoeing” in coverage to avoid litigation. \n\nCritics note this wave of suits—tying records for 2025—reveals how media giants are now prioritizing legal safety over aggressive reporting.\n\nThese developments underscore how Trump’s legal offensives are dismantling the leftist media’s unchecked bias, forcing accountability and exposing their agenda of manufactured scandals to undermine America First policies.\n\nYour support is crucial in helping us defeat mass censorship.

You’re not ready for a woman. You are not.”\n\n“You know, we’ve got a lot of growing up to do,” she continued. “And there’s still, sadly, a lot of men who do not feel like they can be led by a woman, and we saw it.”\n\nObama appeared to amplify previous complaints on her book tour that she was under a “particularly white hot glare” as a black First Lady, saying even Democrats were trying to destroy her when she became “effective” when her husband was running in the primaries for the 2008 nomination.\n\nShe told the audience:\n\nLet me be clear, these were our people who were going after me. This started when we were running against our party. The beginning of turning me into an angry shrew who diminished her husband, who didn’t love her country, who was unpatriotic…These people are lying. They’re making stuff up because they’re trying to win.\n\nShe said when she got to the White House she had to “quickly define myself” and “I didn’t even feel I had the support of the campaign” because “they were white folks, too.”\n\n“So, I knew this immediately. And I knew this coming in as First Lady, that I was in charge of my story, my narrative,” she said. “I had to be smarter than them.

Instead, they have become a political spectacle, the same tiresome theatre we’ve seen unfold across Western democracies. When a leader cannot be defeated at the ballot box, the fallback is to bury them under indictments. Israel did not invent this tactic it simply imported it from countries that have turned legal systems into political weapons.\n\nDonald Trump experienced this firsthand. In the United States, ordinary political actions were elevated into near-apocalyptic scandals. Talking to a journalist became a conspiracy; questioning a bureaucrat became insurrection; looking sideways at an agency became a threat to the republic. Trump now claims he will launch counteroffensives, even threatening legal action against media organizations like the BBC for what he calls deliberate political distortion. Whether he follows through or not, the point is clear. Once politics infiltrates the legal system, retaliation becomes inevitable. Netanyahu’s prosecution fits squarely within this global pattern.\n\nThe charges against Netanyahu themselves are almost farcical. Receiving cigars and champagne from businessman Arnon Milchan and Australian billionaire, James Packer, is now treated as a national crisis. Discussing media coverage with a newspaper owner is framed as criminal activity, despite the fact that politicians everywhere engage in the same behavior. Even regulatory decisions that Netanyahu made, which coincidentally resulted in positive press coverage, have been treated as bribery. If that is the standard, Australian ministers would need rotating prison cells. And in the most absurd example, even a simple gift to a child, Netanyahu’s son Yair receiving a teddy bear as a five-year-old has been treated as part of a scandal.\n\nIt’s worth asking, surely, with Israel facing the war in Gaza, there are far bigger issues to concern the country than prosecuting its sitting prime minister. Netanyahu is actively working to expand the Abraham Accords and strengthen Israel’s regional alliances, an effort that could shape the Middle East for years to come. If anyone should be scrutinizing this, it seems the left-leaning media and political class, historically critical of Netanyahu, would have more reason to focus on diplomacy and security than minor alleged improprieties. Even during the war, Netanyahu was spending time in court.\n\nThe real issue is not the charges themselves but who gets targeted and who gets protected. When Netanyahu or Trump faces charges, the media declares it justice. If similar allegations were directed at Kamala Harris or another progressive figure, the reaction would be instantaneous. Critics would be labelled sexist, racist, bigoted, misogynist or enemies of democracy. It is not conduct but narrative alignment that determines the outrage.\n\nAustralia provides a clear example of this selective standard. Scott Morrison faced relentless scrutiny, often disproportionate for policy decisions, mishandled crises, or even minor missteps. His holidays in Hawaii, for example, were portrayed as a national disaster while bushfires devastated parts of the country. By contrast, Anthony Albanese has faced little criticism for his own absences during crises. While floods ravaged parts of Australia, Albanese was on holiday—yet the press barely blinked. Actions by Albanese that mirror or surpass the controversies surrounding Morrison are treated as minor, framed as pragmatic, nuanced, or attributed to broader circumstances. Who can forget Albanese’s close friendship with Qantas CEO Alan Joyce and the favors that flowed to the airline and the chairman’s lounge membership to his son as a glaring example of preferential treatment that barely registers in the media. The perception is undeniable: Morrison bore the blowtorch while Albanese receives incense. This is not about morality. It is about media alignment and selective outrage.\n\nThe charges against Netanyahu are not just weak, they are emblematic of a global trend in which prosecutorial tools are wielded as political weapons. When the right is targeted, it is called accountability; when the left is targeted, it is labelled oppression. This is not justice, it is narrative warfare. Democracies caught in this cycle lose the ability to judge actions on their merits rather than on political alignment.","url":"https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-vs-hypocrisy-a-global-farce/","image":"https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/blogs/uploads/users/shane-shmuel1754222086-400x400.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-16 16:23:00","author":"Shane Shmuel","authors":["Shane Shmuel"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"il","sentiment":-0.259},{"id":379561370,"title":"SNL recap: Glenn Powell's maverick act, Epstein files, 6-7 meme and the day after Taken","text":"During the run-up to the 2024 US Election, comedian Stephen Colbert had joked that since Kamala Harris was shopping for a male white running mate, she might as well pick Glenn Powell, arguing that the tagline could have been: Yes, we Glen. It certainly couldn’t have been worse than Tim Walz. For a while Glen Powell has been auditioning to be America’s next favourite leading man, probably a position that he is jousting with another Maverick co-star and SNL host Miles Teller and his SNL debut showed just why.Its host wasn’t just smooth, it was swagger wrapped in sincerity: a monologue that poked fun at his own myth-making, sketches that leaned into his charm and physical comedy, and a surprise UPS driver cameo that turned into the night’s most disarming moment. By the end of the episode, Powell had pulled off something rare for SNL — making a heavily engineered show feel genuinely fun.Monologue: childhood clips, Top Gun jokes, and the UPS callbackPowell opened with an easy, confident monologue anchored by a classic “your mom” joke and a quick plug for his new film The Running Man. He dipped into his childhood acting reel, flashing a commercial from when he was ten and joking that it was his original audition for Top Gun. For a moment he leaned fully into show-off mode, which the audience loved.He joked about how most people still remembered him first from his blink-and-miss appearance in Spy Kids (2003), and he wasn’t wrong.A few days earlier, Powell had gone viral for recreating Christopher Walken’s “Weapon of Choice” dance. He carried that same energy here: loose swagger, light physical comedy and a deliberately botched flip that saw him wheeled away in a mock neck brace. It was goofy and charming.Then came the emotional punchline. Powell said he had been supposed to host SNL four years ago during the Top Gun: Maverick run. The call came while he was with his family during the “Christmas episode”, and they celebrated by taking a selfie with their UPS driver. Covid delayed and eventually killed that episode. But the UPS driver lived on in family lore.Tonight, Powell flew him to New York and brought him on stage. The hug, the applause, the wholesomeness — all of it landed perfectly.Cold open: The dog that hasn’t barkedSNL went straight for the week’s most radioactive story: Trump’s appearance in the newly released Epstein emails. James Austin Johnson’s Trump arrived in full damage-control mode, insisting he was “hiding almost nothing”. Karoline Leavitt did her best deadpan spin, saying “no weird information was revealed”.The sketch closed with Trump pardoning a turkey who “by complete coincidence” is a convicted sex criminal. Not subtle, but effective.Uncanny valley vibesThe AI sketch took aim at digital nostalgia tools that animate old photos. What began as a sweet moment — a smiling, waving dad — quickly morphed into disturbing, uncanny facial movements. It echoed the real discomfort around apps like 2wai, which recently went viral for all the wrong reasons.Sometimes photos don’t need motion or magic. They need stillness.Almost Hollywood: 'Norwegian Movie'“Norwegian Movie” leaned hard into Scandinavian stereotypes. Mikey Day played an American director guiding two Norwegian actors, Powell and Chloe Fineman, through a Bergman-style drama. The exaggerated accents and quirky hairstyles felt old-fashioned, but the cast’s full-tilt commitment gave the sketch some lift.James Austin Johnson’s Stellan Skarsgård impression was a standout.The bachelor partyA showcase for Marcello Hernández’s Sebastian Maniscalco impression, and he dove in completely. Powell played the groom introducing him to the group, and the room oscillated between confusion and near-breaks, which added to the fun.Chloe Fineman’s Jennifer Coolidge cameo arrived as the final twist, delivered via an unexpected “stripper”.The slay divisionThis sketch went for pure, joyful silliness. A military base run like a runway ballroom. Powell, Bowen Yang and Sarah Sherman led the “Slay Division” with fierce bobs, sharper insults and unapologetic attitude. Leslie Bibb played their commanding officer with deadpan authority.The rival “Bang Battalion” brought the high-school-mean-girls energy. Whether it nudged military culture or simply embraced chaos, it worked.What even is the 6–7 meme? Weekend Update goes darkWeekend Update leaned heavily into the Epstein email revelations. Jost and Che went darker than usual, firing jokes about SNAP cuts, ICE raiding Home Depot, the shutdown ending after 43 days and a doctored BBC clip implying Trump was “going down on Bill Clinton”.Epstein’s email handle, “jeevacation@gmail.com”, gave Jost one of the night’s biggest laughs when he compared it to Jeffrey Dahmer using “dinnertimejeff”. Even a stray jab about Jost being related to Hitler found its mark.‘Classic’ haircutOne of the night’s simplest sketches and one of its best. Ashley Padilla arrived late to Friendsgiving, proudly sporting a haircut from a celebrity stylist. It was a hilariously disastrous high-fashion cut that no real person could wear.Padilla played the denial and heartbreak beautifully. The cast gave polite horror, while the waiter was blunt. The final joke — that the waiter shared the same stylist — landed perfectly.Miss who?“I Miss My Ex’s Dad” was a polished musical parody built on a wonderfully dumb premise. Ben Marshall and Tommy Brennan sang a country ballad not about missing their exes but their exes’ dads. Powell appeared as the dream father figure, and Kenan Thompson played Gary, “the dad they never had”.The final twist, where the dad sings that he misses them too, added a strangely sweet layer.Making Louvre: 'Taken: Airport'“Taken: Airport” imagined what happens after the action-movie rescue ends and everyone tries to behave normally again. Powell played Bryan, the hero dad, with easy confidence. Andrew Dismukes played Dennis, the insecure stepdad trying to match him.Powell’s Bryan slipped back into rescue mode so aggressively he “stole” his ex-wife again, while Dennis blamed jet lag.Olivia Dean’s performancesOlivia Dean’s performances of “Man I Need” and “Let Alone the One You Love” offered calm in the middle of a chaotic episode. Her warm, controlled vocals and gentle stage presence gave the show a quiet emotional reset. She sang with sincerity, without ever tipping into excess.MacGruber’s style of dodging pedophile allegations“MacGruber II” brought back Will Forte’s unhinged hero, now spiralling as he tried to rewrite the Epstein list while a live bomb ticked away. Powell and Chloe Fineman played horrified partners.The sketch delivered peak MacGruber: panic, shouting, terrible timing and a bomb that never gets defused because he’s too busy trying to hide his own name. Taping the Epstein documents to the bomb just before it explodes was exactly the kind of deranged punchline the character thrives on.","summary":"Glenn Powell made his SNL hosting debut, sharing personal anecdotes and promoting his new movie.

Please.","text":"Michelle Obama said this week that America is “not ready for a woman president,” adding that “we saw that in the last election.” Cute. Predictable. And only barely half right. The former First Lady wants you to believe that America rejected the idea of a woman leading the free world because we’re too primitive, too sexist, too stuck in the Stone Age to recognize brilliance when it smiles into a camera.\n\nWe rejected Kamala Harris — because she is, without exaggeration, the emptiest pantsuit ever shuffled onto a debate stage. She didn’t lose because she’s a woman. She lost because she’s incompetent, inauthentic, unprepared, and catastrophically unlikable. The cackle alone should be classified as a U.N. violation.\n\nAnd while we’re on the topic — Michelle Obama belongs to the political party that literally cannot define what a woman is without turning into a bowl of stuttering linguistic Jell-O. If your movement can’t even explain the basic biological reality behind the word, maybe — just maybe — you aren’t the authority on who should lead the free world.\n\nSo yes — Michelle is half right. America isn’t ready for those women. The women the Democratic machine keeps trying to shove at us like expired yogurt.\n\nLet’s run down the aisle of rejects.\n\nDo we want Kamala Harris?\n\nNo — unless the requirement for leading the free world is giggling like a malfunctioning toy and producing word salads that make Joe Biden sound like Churchill.\n\nDo we want the emerging crop of far-left progressive “influencer politicians” — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Jasmine Crockett, Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib?\n\nHard pass. These are politicians who believe America is irredeemably evil, capitalism is oppression, and terrorists deserve sympathy. Putting them in charge of the Oval Office would be like putting a vegan in charge of a steakhouse — flames, chaos, bankruptcy, tears.\n\nDo we want the old guard — Nancy Pelosi and Hillary Clinton?\n\nNo. These aren’t leaders; they’re museum exhibits from an era where corruption was an Olympic sport and arrogance won gold. They had their shot. We survived.\n\nDo we want Michelle Obama herself? Also no. Being extremely famous and having a Netflix deal does not qualify someone to sit across from Putin or Xi and decide questions of war and peace. The presidency isn’t an Oprah couch interview. It’s not “Ellen.” It’s not a speaking tour. It’s a brutal, grinding, relentless 24/7 job that requires a steel spine and a willingness to make painful decisions that save nations and cost sleep.\n\nWe do not need a “Nurturer-in-Chief.” We need someone who walks into a negotiation and every adversary in the room sits up straight.\n\nHere’s the part where Michelle is almost right: We’re not ready — but only because the culture has been hijacked by a dumbed-down feminism that says just being a woman should be enough.\n\nThe new feminism insists merit is optional, competence isoptional, and performance doesn’t matter as long as identity boxes are checked. It worships feelings instead of facts, substitutes emotion for strategy, and demands power be handed out like participation ribbons.\n\nThat ideology doesn’t help serious women advance — it buries them behind unserious ones.\n\nYou want to know what a serious female leader looks like?\n\nMargaret Thatcher.\n\nShe didn’t whine that the country wasn’t “ready.” She didn’t weaponize gender. She earned the job because she was better — smarter, tougher, more disciplined — than the men around her. The Soviet Union called her the Iron Lady because they feared her. That fear saved lives.\n\nIf America found a Thatcher — a woman of backbone, clarity, courage, strategy, and devotion to this country —she would win in a landslide.\n\nBut instead, Democrats offer TikTok activists, radical ideologues, and emotional performance artists. And when voters recoil, they scream “sexism.”\n\nNo. It’s called standards.\n\nBeing President requires grit when the country is exhausted, clarity when chaos surrounds, and an unshakable spine when tyrants push. It requires courage when every decision has consequences measured in blood.\n\nThat job is not for the weak-willed, the self-promoting, the chronically aggrieved, or the intellectually hollow.\n\nAnd right now, the women the progressive movement is selling us are all four.\n\nSo yes — America is not ready for them.\n\nWhen a serious woman steps up — one defined by merit, not manufactured victimhood — the country will elect her without hesitation.\n\nAmerica isn’t afraid of a woman president.\n\nAmerica is afraid of a bad president.\n\nWe’ll know her when we see her.\n\nAnd she won’t need Michelle Obama making excuses for her before she even arrives.\n\nEditor’s Note: Do you enjoy Townhall’s conservative reporting that takes on the radical left and woke media?

You’re not ready for a woman. You are not.”Criticism of male resistance to female leadershipWhen asked whether her experience in the White House opened the door for a woman president, Michelle Obama said many men still refuse to accept female authority.“You know, we got a lot of growing up to do,” she said. “There’s still, sadly, a lot of men who do not feel like they can be led by a woman, and we saw it.”Support for Kamala Harris in 2024Michelle Obama backed former Vice President Kamala Harris in her 2024 presidential bid, which ultimately failed against Donald Trump. Last year, she urged voters to support Harris, warning that Trump posed a threat to the country.About “The Look”Obama’s new book \"The Look\", co-authored with her longtime stylist, explores fashion, identity and the pressures placed on women in public life.

It’s about identity. It’s about the power of authenticity,” Michelle Obama said.“My hope is that this book sparks conversation and reflection about the ways we see ourselves — and the way our society defines beauty.”She also addresses the scrutiny women in politics face, noting they are often judged more on appearance than leadership ability.Michelle Obama served as first lady from 2009 to 2017 alongside her husband, former President Barack Obama, and remains one of the most influential and widely admired political figures in the country.","url":"https://www.livemint.com/news/us-news/michelle-obama-sparks-debate-says-america-isn-t-ready-for-a-woman-president-claims-us-resists-female-leadership-11763300379391.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2025/11/16/1600x900/logo/AP11-13-2025-000002B-0_1763301318090_1763301334126.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-16 13:59:42","author":"Ravi Hari","authors":["Ravi Hari"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.278},{"id":379543526,"title":"Michelle Obama Explodes Over 2028 Bid, Puts Daughters First: 'Don't Waste My Time'","text":"For years, the question has haunted Democratic social events and hopeful social media campaigns: 'Will Michelle Obama run?'Now, the former First Lady has delivered her most definitive and devastating answer yet, bluntly telling supporters to stop wasting her time and declaring that Americans are simply 'not ready' for her, or any woman, in the Oval Office.Her blunt declaration, which counters persistent speculation and online campaigns urging her to run, makes it crystal clear that her priorities lie firmly elsewhere.'You're Not Ready': Michelle Obama Forcefully Rejects 2028 RunSpeaking at the Brooklyn Academy of Music on 5 November, Michelle Obama joined actress Tracee Ellis Ross for a live chat to promote her new book, The Look. During the conversation, she directly addressed the swirling rumours about a potential 2028 campaign.She pointed to the 2024 election, and specifically Kamala Harris's defeat by Donald Trump, as proof that the United States remains unprepared for a woman president.'As we saw in this past election, sadly, we ain't ready,' she said. 'That's why I'm like, don't even look at me about running, 'cause you all are lying. You're not ready for a woman. You are not. So don't waste my time.'She added that there is 'a lot of growing up to do' in the country, referencing what she described as lingering resistance from men who, in her view, 'do not feel like they can be led by a woman.' The candid exchange was filmed and later posted on her YouTube channel.Why Michelle Obama Puts Family Before 'Unthinkable' PoliticsA central pillar of Obama's refusal to run is the well-being of her daughters, Malia and Sasha. She has long maintained that raising them under the glare of public attention was challenging, and she refuses to revisit that intense spotlight.During a previous episode of the Not Gonna Lie podcast with Kylie Kelce, she stated: 'My daughters have already served their time'.At the BAM event, she reiterated that sentiment, emphasising she does not want to subject them to another political cycle. 'It would be unthinkable,' she said, recalling the sacrifices her family made while she was First Lady. Her message reinforces that she views public office not merely as a personal ambition, but as a decision with a real, and unwanted, emotional cost for her family.Obama also highlighted the broader barriers to women's leadership, noting the bias she believes is still very much alive in American politics. Her comments reflect a long-standing critique she has voiced before: that despite progress, the United States has not matured enough politically or culturally to elect a woman president.This is not the first time Michelle Obama has shut down calls to enter electoral politics. Her rejection goes back many years. In 2018, she told Today that she had 'never wanted to be a politician.'She has said that service need not involve holding office, noting there are 'so many ways to make an impact.' Her husband, Barack Obama, has echoed this, once publicly stating that she 'will never run for office,' citing her lack of desire for the campaign trail.Her forceful rejection leaves Democratic strategists once again without the high-profile nominee many had long hoped for. Despite her announcement, observers note her power remains huge, and she still commands significant public attention, support for her causes, and respect among voters.Meanwhile, social media and political commentators are abuzz.

Calvin Beisner, president of the Cornwall Alliance, told The Daily Signal. “There’s nothing wrong with public servants’ holding strong views, but when they serve their views instead of those of the majority, they cease to serve the public and serve themselves instead.”\n\nOf Cozzolino, Beisner said, “He should show integrity by resigning. If he doesn’t, Trump should fire him.”\n\nWho Is Brett Cozzolino?\n\nAccording to the Office of Personnel Management, Brett Cozzolino started working as executive assistant to the acting director of OPM on Jan. 17, 2016, and joined the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission as an energy industry analyst for litigation on Dec. 26, 2021. His name appears in a report on “political conversions,” which focus on political appointees who later took supposedly non-political “career” roles in the federal government.\n\nAccording to the nationwide salary database OpenPayrolls, Cozzolino appears to have added a second last name—Bhave—before 2023. The database lists a Brett Cozzolino Bhave at FERC, and the details on the verified LinkedIn profile for a “Brett Bhave” match Cozzolino’s work history on the government employee database Legistorm. (The LinkedIn profile disappeared after The Daily Signal reached out to FERC for comment.)\n\nAccording to LinkedIn and Legistorm, Cozzolino joined the Obama administration after working in the office of Democrat Rep. Elijah Cummings, and after working for Obama at OPM (from Jan. 2016 to Jan. 2017), he worked for two climate activist groups, the World Resources Institute and the Yale University School of Forestry and Environmental Studies.\n\nThe World Resources Institute publishes an annual “State of Climate Action” report, which the institute bill as “the most comprehensive roadmap yet for closing the global gap in climate action to help keep the Paris Agreement goal within reach.” The group publishes climate research and advocates for decreasing global carbon emissions on the assumption that these emissions harm the planet. \n\nSimilarly, the Yale University Forest School conducts “education and research” aiming to “increase understanding and leadership on forest-climate interactions, forest resilience, and the role of forests in mitigating climate change.” The Yale School of the Environment, which houses the Forest School, emphasizes climate adaptation and sustainability, mentioning the “climate crisis” in its annual report.\n\n“FERC does not comment on individual personnel,” Celeste Miller, FERC’s acting director of media relations, told The Daily Signal. “Prior to appointments of former political staff, relevant candidates for positions at FERC receive a full review by OPM’s Merit System Accountability and Compliance Process.”\n\nDeep State Opposition to Trump\n\nAn April poll found that a whopping 75% of Washington, D.C.-based federal employees making $75,000 or more per year who voted for Democrat presidential nominee Kamala Harris in November said they would not follow a lawful Trump order if they considered it bad policy.\n\nWhile some political appointees who later took “career” positions—in a process often referred to as “burrowing in”—may faithfully work for the U.S. government under any president, this poll suggests that some staff inside the federal government may work against the goals of the current president, in this case Donald Trump.\n\nFurthermore, a recent Foundation for Government Accountability study found that Democrat employees outnumber Republican employees by a 2-to-1 margin across federal agencies. In the 2024 presidential election, 84% of the money that federal employees gave in political contributions went to Harris.\n\nThe Daily Signal does not have any evidence that Cozzolino plans to oppose Trump from within.\n\nThe Daily Signal reached out to the Obama Foundation, the World Resources Institute, and the Yale School of the Environment for comment. None responded by publication time.","summary":"A former staffer in the Barack Obama White House who went to work for climate activist groups joined a federal agency regulating energy under President...

We fight like hell.”\n\nThe BBC has said it will not air the Panorama episode “Trump: A Second Chance?” again, and published a retraction on the show’s webpage on Thursday.","summary":"Sending BBC licence fee money \"over to Mar-a-Lago\" would not be a \"smart\" thing to do, the shadow home secretary has said after Donald Trump threatened to sue the corporation for up to $5billion.","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/bbc-donald-trump-panorama-sue-b2866138.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/11/16/1/39/U-S--President-Trump-boards-Air-Force-One-for-travel-to-Palm-Beach-Florida-tweaeagp.jpeg?crop=5500,3666.7,x0,y0.2&trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/Ff8CqMc8-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-11-16 11:14:29","author":"Caitlin Doherty","authors":["Caitlin Doherty"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.417},{"id":379505622,"title":"How the shutdown left Democrats questioning Chuck Schumer’s future more than ever","text":"As eight senators in Chuck Schumer’s caucus broke ranks to side with Republicans and vote to end the government shutdown fight he had engineered, the New York Democrat was on the phone trying to make it clear it wasn’t his fault. Dialing governors and influential party leaders, Schumer had a basic request: attack Republicans over rising health care costs, not Senate Democrats or him. Schumer knew he’d have to rebut accusations that he secretly guided the deal, while others would see him as not being able to control his caucus. He’d kept Senate Democrats united longer than they wanted to be, Schumer said in the calls, even as he’d been trying to keep the shutdown going until Thanksgiving. According to people familiar with his request, he wanted public backup for his strategy. Some of those Schumer called told him no. Some just didn’t do it. Coming out of the nation’s longest shutdown, the Senate minority leader is more vulnerable than he’s ever been, both on Capitol Hill and back home in New York, and is facing serious doubts about whether he can drive opposition to President Donald Trump. Few believe Schumer, who turns 75 this month, will run for a sixth term in 2028 — and they say he could go down in a primary challenge if he tries, with some contenders already quietly preparing to run. And inside the Senate Democratic ranks, Schumer is facing more grumbling than he ever has, not unlike past House and Senate leaders in their final years on the job. CNN’s interviews with two dozen top Democrats in Congress and in New York revealed grimaces and sighs amid a reluctance to speak on the record about Schumer. Many expressed sympathy for him and said they don’t want to fuel further infighting as Democrats seek to refocus on challenging Trump. But many echo what Antonio Delgado, the former House member and current New York lieutenant governor, said out loud as he wages his own upstart primary challenge against Gov. Kathy Hochul. “I would hope he doesn’t run for reelection,” Delgado told CNN. “I hope that by the time we get to 2028, we’re talking about different voices, we’re talking about folks that are younger that can bring a different kind of energy.” Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, who is seen as a likely presidential candidate in 2028 and has spent the year leading pushback to Trump, was asked by CNN whether he sees Schumer as a leader for the Democrats’ future. “That’s an interesting question, a leader of the future. I mean, he’s a reasonable amount older than I am. So it’s hard to say about somebody —what is he, in his 70s? — ‘leader of the future,’” said Pritzker, 60. Privately, the assessment is even blunter. “It’s his last term, and he may be the only one on Earth unaware of it,” one House Democrat from New York told CNN. Schumer and close advisers, meanwhile, are angry at how much he’s being blamed: by Democratic senators they consider disloyal, by pundits on the left they think are making the fight internal rather than about Republicans, and by House Democrats they think didn’t do enough. A person familiar with Schumer’s thinking argued his focus is taking back the Senate majority in 2026, an uphill climb given the Republican-friendly map, but which could dramatically change the mood of the party and Schumer’s own standing. Asked whether he would run again or could survive a primary challenge, the source said Schumer is “not even thinking of 2028” while he digs in on the midterms. “We’ll go from there,” said the person, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal political calculations. Inside Schumer’s handling of the shutdown Frustrated after the 2024 election swung to Republicans on what he thought should be Democratic ground of affordability, Schumer gamed out this year early. He felt he couldn’t win an argument against Trump in the first few months of his presidency; he had to find a way to break the president’s connection with voters by the fall and then hope to win them over into the midterms. After the fury among Democrats when he backed down from a spending fight in March, Schumer knew he needed to be ready for a shutdown in the fall. Deciding to make it about health care came second, after a summer of voters angry about Medicaid work requirements and eligibility reviews estimated to leave millions of people without coverage from Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill.” Democrats in the House and Senate landed on saying the shutdown would be about extending expiring Obamacare subsidies. Trump’s refusal to negotiate with him only helped the argument, Schumer figured. Polls suggested Democrats were winning the public argument on health care and who was to blame for the shutdown. And on November 4, Democrats swept the off-year elections. But Schumer strained to keep the shutdown going another week. He could tell some senators were cracking as the costs became worse. A few, like his deputy, Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, said they couldn’t bear to see the lines of people going hungry. A few said they were worried about a Thanksgiving travel meltdown with the shortage of air traffic controllers. Nevada Sen. Jacky Rosen, meanwhile, was upset about a friend who had been furloughed and died by suicide. Schumer kept tabs on the senators negotiating with Senate Majority Leader John Thune, arguing that the top Republican was meeting with them and not Schumer because he’d be harder to satisfy. ​“The idea” Schumer “orchestrated this is f***ing ridiculous,” the person said, referring to the deal to reopen the government that didn’t include health care provisions, only a separate Senate vote later that the House hasn’t committed to matching. The person was also reflecting the rage the senator and people close to him have for Democratic pundits for focusing on him rather than on Trump, and for House Democrats for complaining after most stayed out of Washington for more than a month. Schumer is still attempting to call the outcome a victory in the long term. Polls suggest voters blame Republicans more than Democrats for the rising costs of health care and other costs of living, with affordability concerns expected to dominate the 2026 midterm campaign. “No one’s going to remember six months from now which week it ended,” the person familiar with Schumer’s thinking said. “They’re going to remember health care. And we made health care the prime issue — and an issue that we’re going to move forward on.” A fight for credit Schumer has defenders like New York Rep. Adriano Espaillat, who told CNN, “He held for many weeks, and he voted no. I think the others voted yes and they should be held accountable.” But Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the progressive New Yorker who is seen as Schumer’s biggest primary threat, accused him of having “knowledge” of the deal cut to reopen the government “in exchange for nothing.” No one expects a coup or immediate change. But many are already counting on the pressure ramping up by the end of next year, fueled by newer senators and presidential candidates (some of whom are likely to be senators) eager to strut their new-generation bona fides. Pritzker said most of his anger is at the “mutineers,” as he called the eight Democratic caucus members who voted to end the shutdown, and at Trump, who “has weaponized food assistance and health care. And I know that Chuck Schumer cares about those things. I just would say that we are in a world where you’re going to have to pick sides, and Democrats need to pick ‘team fight.’” A spokesperson for New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, the new hero of the left whom Schumer pointedly wouldn’t endorse, did not respond when asked whether he sees the senator as part of the party’s future or wants to see him run again. But one of Mamdani’s closest advisers on Friday expressed support for a consortium of liberal groups pushing for Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen to take over as leader. If Democrats don’t win the majority next year, even people loyal to Schumer acknowledge he will undoubtedly face calls to step down. Senators vote by secret ballot in leadership elections, based out of their personal relationships and their own self-interest. So far, none of Schumer’s Democratic senators have called on him to step aside. Schumer’s chances of staying leader are better if Democrats win back the majority, but that would require several upsets in red states. Schumer is working to recruit former Rep. Mary Peltola to run for Senate instead of Alaska governor, much like when he got former Sen. Sherrod Brown to make that same choice in Ohio. He worked all year and through much refusal to get Maine Gov. Janet Mills into the race against Sen. Susan Collins, convinced Mills was their best chance of winning even as she’d become the oldest freshman senator in history and while others in Schumer’s caucus praise the younger Graham Platner. His concern goes beyond legislating. Schumer believes that if Republicans keep the Senate, Supreme Court Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, both in their mid-70s, will retire to let Trump replace them with judges in their 40s who would be reliable conservative votes for decades. But the politics and agita of the post-Joe Biden Democratic Party are different now than even a year ago, Schumer critics warn and loyalists acknowledge. The guy who pioneered the Sunday news conference back home and mastered Washington media isn’t a natural fit for TikTok politics, some Democrats say. “2028 is far away,” said New York Rep. Grace Meng, without making any commitments. “We will have time to debate how we handle things as a big-tent party. But this is not the time or place while we need to be laser-focused on winning back the House and protecting Americans against the actions of the administration and the Republican majority,” she said. New York Democrats are already maneuvering for his seat New York politicians are already coalescing around the expectation that Schumer won’t run in an election that will come right before 78th birthday. That would create the first open Senate race in New York since Hillary Clinton upended years of Democratic rank-and-file planning when she swooped in for the 2000 race. Ocasio-Cortez is still the main factor, seen as unbeatable in a primary were she to run, given her political celebrity and enthusiasm on the left. That has New York’s ambitious politicians rooting for her to run for president in 2028 instead and leave them to fight over the Senate seat. A list of other names is quietly going around. New York Attorney General Letitia James, another potential field clearer, is not seen as likely to want it. Rep. Tom Suozzi, the moderate from Long Island, has abandoned his statewide dreams after his failed 2022 gubernatorial run. Some see Rep. Ritchie Torres from the Bronx as a possibility. The one generating the most chatter is Rep. Pat Ryan, an Army intelligence veteran who first came to Congress in a 2022 special election in which he championed abortion rights and who last year significantly outperformed Kamala Harris in his Hudson Valley district. He’s brought Ocasio-Cortez to campaign with him, he’s close to the governor and he spoke out in favor of Mamdani at a key moment over the summer. Earlier this month, Ryan appeared at a fundraiser for Suozzi and endorsed 55 candidates for state and local office through his Patriot PAC created in September. Asked about his own plans, Ryan declined to comment. Ocasio-Cortez said only slightly more when asked about her plans. “He’s not up for election this cycle,” she told CNN when asked whether she was considering a primary challenge to Schumer. “So, I’ll see you.”","url":"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/11/16/politics/chuck-schumer-democrats-future","image":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c-2025-11-11t001756z-1086871624-rc2o2ha6162l-rtrmadp-3-usa-shutdown-fallout.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-16 11:00:01","author":"Edward-Isaac Dovere,Manu Raju","authors":["Edward-Isaac Dovere","Manu Raju"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.261},{"id":379521356,"title":"Commentary: Front-runner or flash in the pan? Sizing up Newsom, 2028","text":"The 2028 presidential election is more than 1,000 days away, but you'd hardly know it from all the speculation and anticipation that's swirling from Sacramento to the Washington Beltway. Standing at the center of attention is California Gov. Gavin Newsom, fresh off his big victory on Proposition 50, the backatcha ballot measure that gerrymandered the state's congressional map to boost Democrats and offset a power grab by Texas Republicans. Newsom is bidding for the White House, and has been doing so for the better part of a year, though he won't say so out loud. Is Newsom the Democratic front-runner or a mere flash in the pan? Times columnists Anita Chabria and Mark Z. Barabak disagree on Newsom's presidential prospects, and more. Here the two hash out some of their differences. Barabak: So is the presidential race over, Anita? Should I just spend the next few years backpacking and snowboarding in the Sierra and return in January 2029 to watch Newsom iterate, meet the moment and, with intentionality, be sworn in as our nation's 48th president? Chabria: You should definitely spend as much time in the Sierra as possible, but I have no idea if Newsom will be elected president in 2028 or not. That's about a million light-years away in political terms. But I think he has a shot, and is the front-runner for the nomination right now. He's set himself up as the quick-to-punch foil to President Trump, and increasingly as the leader of the Democratic Party. Last week, he visited Brazil for a climate summit that Trump ghosted, making Newsom the American presence. And in a recent (albeit small) poll, in a hypothetical race against JD Vance, the current Republican favorite, Newsom lead by three points. Though, unexpectedly, respondents still picked Kamala Harris as their choice for the nomination. To me, that shows he's popular across the country. But you've warned that Californians have a tough time pulling voters in other states. Do you think his Golden State roots will kill off his contender status? Barabak: I make no predictions. I'm smart enough to know that I'm not smart enough to know. And, after 2016 and the election of Trump, the words \"can't,\" \"not,\" \"won't,\" \"never ever\" are permanently stricken from my political vocabulary. That said, I wouldn't stake more than a penny — which may eventually be worth something, as they're phased out of our currency — on Newsom's chances. Look, I yield to no one in my love of California. (And I've got the Golden State tats to prove it.) But I'm mindful of how the rest of the country views the state and those politicians who bear a California return address. You can be sure whoever runs against Newsom — and I'm talking about his fellow Democrats, not just Republicans — will have a great deal to say about the state's much-higher-than-elsewhere housing, grocery and gas prices and our shameful rates of poverty and homelessness. Not a great look for Newsom, especially when affordability is all the political rage these days. And while I understand the governor's appeal — Fight! Fight! Fight! — I liken it to the fleeting fancy that, for a time, made attorney, convicted swindler and rhetorical battering ram Michael Avenatti seriously discussed as a Democratic presidential contender. At a certain point — and we're still years away — people will assess the candidates with their head, not viscera. As for the polling, ask Edmund Muskie, Gary Hart or Hillary Clinton how much those soundings matter at this exceedingly early stage of a presidential race. Well, you can't ask Muskie, because the former Maine senator is dead. But all three were early front-runners who failed to win the Democratic nomination. Chabria: I don't argue the historical case against the Golden State, but I will argue that these are different days. People don't vote with their heads. Fight me on that. They vote on charisma, tribalism, and maybe some hope and fear. They vote on issues as social media explains them. They vote on memes. There no reality in which our next president is rationally evaluated on their record — our current president has a criminal one and that didn't make a difference. But I do think, as we've talked about ad nauseam, that democracy is in peril. Trump has threatened to run for a third term and recently lamented that his Cabinet doesn't show him the same kind of fear that Chinese President Xi Jinping gets from his top advisers. And Vance, should he get the chance to run, has made it clear he's a Christian nationalist who would like to deport nearly every immigrant he can catch, legal or not. Being a Californian may not be the drawback it's historically been, especially if Trump's authoritarianism continues and this state remains the symbol of resistance. But our governor does have an immediate scandal to contend with. His former chief of staff, Dana Williamson, was just arrested on federal corruption charges. Do you think that hurts him? Barabak: It shouldn't. There's no evidence of wrongdoing on Newsom's part. His opponents will try the guilt-by-association thing. Some already have. But unless something damning surfaces, there's no reason the governor should be punished for the alleged wrongdoing of Williamson or others charged in the case. But let's go back to 2028 and the presidential race. I think one of our fundamental disagreements is that I believe people do very much evaluate a candidate's ideas and records. Not in granular fashion, or the way some chin-stroking political scientist might. But voters do want to know how and whether a candidate can materially improve their lives. There are, of course, a great many who'd reflexively support Donald Trump, or Donald Duck for that matter, if he's the Republican nominee. Same goes for Democrats who'd vote for Gavin Newsom or Gavin Floyd, if either were the party's nominee. (While Newsom played baseball in college, Floyd pitched 13 seasons in the major leagues, so he's got that advantage over the governor.) But I'm talking about those voters who are up for grabs — the ones who decide competitive races — who make a very rational decision based on their lives and livelihoods and which candidate they believe will benefit them most. Granted, the dynamic is a bit different in a primary contest. But even then, we've seen time and again the whole dated/married phenomenon. As in 2004, when a lot of Democrats \"dated\" Howard Dean early in the primary season but \"married\" John Kerry. I see electability — as in the perception of which Democrat can win the general election — being right up there alongside affordability when it comes time for primary voters to make their 2028 pick. Chabria: No doubt affordability will be a huge issue, especially if consumer confidence continues to plummet. And we are sure to hear criticisms of California, many of which are fair, as you point out. Housing costs too much, homelessness remains intractable. But these are also problems across the United States, and require deeper fixes than even this economically powerful state can handle alone. More than past record, future vision is going to matter. What's the plan? It can't be vague tax credits or even student loan forgiveness. We need a concrete vision for an economy that brings not just more of the basics like homes, but the kind of long-term economic stability — higher wages, good schools, living-wage jobs — that makes the middle class stronger and attainable. The Democrat who can lay out that vision while simultaneously continuing to battle the authoritarian creep currently eating our democracy will, in my humble opinion, be the one voters choose, regardless of origin story. After all, it was that message of change with hope that gave us President Obama, another candidate many considered a long shot at first. Mark, are there any 2028 prospects you're keeping a particularly close eye on? Barabak: I'm taking things one election at a time, starting with the 2026 midterms, which include an open-seat race for governor here in California. The results in November 2026 will go a long way toward shaping the dynamic in November 2028. That said, there's no shortage of Democrats eyeing the race — too many to list here. Will the number surpass the 29 major Democrats who ran in 2020? We'll see. I do agree with you that, to stand any chance of winning in 2028, whomever Democrats nominate will have to offer some serious and substantive ideas on how to make people's lives materially better. Imperiled democracy and scary authoritarianism aside, it's still the economy, stupid. Which brings us full circle, back to our gallivanting governor. He may be winning fans and building his national fundraising base with his snippy memes and zippy Trump put-downs. But even if he gets past the built-in anti-California bias among so many voters outside our blessed state, he's not going to snark his way to the White House. I'd wager more than a penny on that.","summary":"Two LA Times columnists differ over the presidential prospects of California's governor, who has a White House gleam in his eye.

And he wasn’t always appreciated by Democrats.\n\nDecades before his death Nov. 3 at 84, Cheney was a top GOP bogeyman as Bush's vice president for advocating the war in Iraq, for defending the harsh interrogation of terrorists and for expanding domestic surveillance after the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. But in his later years, Democrats praised Cheney for his opposition to President Donald Trump because of the Jan. 6 riot.\n\nRep. Nancy Pelosi, D-California, who became House speaker during the Bush administration in part because of the unpopularity of the Iraq war, had tangled repeatedly with Cheney when he was vice president. She called the Iraq war \"a war of choice\" and a \"grotesque mistake.\" But she also appointed Liz Cheney to the committee that investigated the Jan. 6 attack. Pelosi shook Dick Cheney's hand after leading the House in a moment of silence for the riot.\n\n“Dick Cheney was a patriotic American who loved his country,” Pelosi said in a social media post Nov. 4. “While we strongly disagreed on most policy issues, his patriotism was clear when he returned to the House Floor to commemorate the first anniversary of January 6th.”\n\nCheney and Democrats clashed over Iraq before uniting against Trump\n\nCheney had helped direct the Persian Gulf War as Defense secretary under President George H.W. Bush. After Sept. 11, Cheney became the architect of the war plans in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\nHe embraced the nickname Darth Vader because of his confidence in positions others heavily criticized. One clash arose in February 2007, when Cheney told ABC News that Pelosi's attempts to block an additional surge of troops into Iraq would \"validate the al Qaeda strategy.\"\n\n\"I think it would be a mistake for the country,\" Cheney said.\n\nPelosi responded that critics have to challenge the president and said Cheney's reference to al Qaeda was \"beneath the dignity of the sacrifice of our troops.\"\n\nCheney kept a relatively lower public profile after leaving office in 2009, as is typical of former presidents and vice presidents. He offered commentary on politics and foreign affairs, and wrote several books about politics and his health, after getting a heart transplant following his fifth heart attack. Like many in his party, Cheney endorsed Trump as the top of the Republican ticket in 2016.\n\nBut Cheney's public reputation turned when he criticized Trump for the Jan. 6 riot. He later endorsed Democratic 2024 presidential nominee Kamala Harris, then the incumbent vice president, in her campaign against Trump.\n\n\"There has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump,\" Cheney said at the time.\n\nLiz Cheney was one of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump over Jan. 6. He was acquitted in a Senate trial. She called Trump \"clearly unfit\" for the presidency and joined the panel in urging the Justice Department to prosecute Trump for Jan. 6.\n\n“We all saw then how proud Vice President Cheney was to see his daughter, Liz, follow in her father’s footsteps to serve in the House with courage and integrity,” Pelosi said in her social media post. “May it be a comfort to Lynne, Liz and Mary that so many are praying for them at this sad time.”\n\nRaskin found Cheney's 'dramatic' break from Trump 'encouraging'\n\nRep. Jamie Raskin, D-Maryland, who also served on the Jan. 6 committee and led the second impeachment of Trump, said Dick Cheney personified bipartisan opposition to the Capitol attack.\n\n“Dick Cheney had always been seen as such a bulwark and mastermind of conservative Republican politics,” Raskin told USA TODAY. “It was a dramatic and encouraging thing to see him break so sharply from Donald Trump.”\n\nAs a 27-year professor of constitutional law, Raskin had marched against the Iraq war and vehemently opposed Dick Cheney’s policies during that period. Raskin said Cheney was a champion of the executive branch and tried to stretch the limits of presidential power – while obeying the rule of law.\n\n“For all of our profound differences with Dick Cheney, he was not someone who said the Constitution and the rule of law didn’t matter,” Raskin said. “He just had a different interpretation of what they meant.”\n\nAt one point in the Jan. 6 investigation, Raskin defended fellow committee member Liz Cheney on the House floor against an oral attack by a fellow Republican. Dick Cheney later called to thank him.\n\n“It was very much a paternal gesture,” Raskin said. “It reinforced for me the tender feelings.”\n\nHoyer: Cheney was 'no softie' but displayed 'human side' over Jan. 6\n\nHoyer, the second-ranking House Democrat when the Jan. 6 anniversary memorial was held, said he thanked Cheney for personifying the bipartisan view that the fatal riot in the U.S. Capitol should never be repeated. Hoyer had served with Cheney in the House during the 1980s and knew the second-ranking Republican as a partisan conservative who was \"very, very tough.\"\n\n“Because he was no softie, his statement was even stronger that, ‘Yes, I believe in a strong, centralized president, but I don’t believe in insurrection. I don’t believe in treason. I don’t believe in undermining the Constitution,’” Hoyer said.\n\nHoyer said he had strongly supported Liz Cheney in standing up to the president, despite losing her House leadership position and later her reelection campaign to a GOP primary challenger who was backed by Trump − because of the Jan. 6 investigation.\n\n“She called upon her fellow Republicans to show the same kind of courage when the emperor had no clothes, to say the emperor had no clothes, with the knowledge that the emperor was very powerful and could respond very negatively,” Hoyer said. \"In fact, he did, sadly.\"\n\nCheney becomes GOP outcast over Jan. 6\n\nDick and Liz Cheney were the only two Republicans to attend the moment of silence on the 2022 anniversary of the Jan. 6 attack.\n\n\"I am deeply disappointed at the failure of many members of my party to recognize the grave nature of the January 6 attacks and the ongoing threat to our nation,\" Dick Cheney said in a statement at the time.\n\n“The importance of January 6th as an historic event cannot be overstated,” Cheney added. “I was honored and proud to join my daughter on the House floor to recognize this anniversary, to commend the heroic actions of law enforcement that day, and to reaffirm our dedication to the Constitution.”\n\nTrump was a longtime critic of Bush and Cheney, and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. He also faced federal and state criminal charges over his role in Jan. 6, though the cases were either dropped or remain on hold while Trump is in the White House.\n\nThe current president has not made any public comments about Cheney since his death.

In September, the group split 44 percent approval to 54 percent disapproval (–10). By October, approval slipped to 42 percent and disapproval reached 53 percent (–11). The latest November numbers show a sharper deterioration: just 40 percent approve of Trump’s performance, while 58 percent disapprove—a steep net decline of 18 points\n\nThe shift comes after a disruptive government shutdown and amid continued anxiety about food prices, housing costs, and winter energy bills.\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nMiddle-income Americans have historically been a contested but important group for the Republican Party. In the 2024 presidential election, Trump won 52 percent of the vote among those earning $50,000-$100,000 compared to Kamala Harris’ 46 percent, flipping support from a group that had been more favorable to the Democrats in the 2020 election—when Trump won 46 percent of their votes compared to Joe Biden’s 54 percent.\n\nThe latest polls suggest support from middle-income earners may be slipping away from the Republican Party.\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks before signing the funding bill to reopen the government, in the Oval Office of the White House, Wednesday, Nov. 12, 2025, in Washington. \n\nWhat To Know\n\nThe shift comes as affordability concerns dominate the political landscape. New car prices have soared to above $50,000 on average, pushing a basic purchase into luxury-level territory for many middle-income families.\n\nBehind the scenes, the New York Federal Reserve reports that the country’s debt burden has swollen to $18.6 trillion, the highest level since the agency began tracking it two decades ago. Mortgages, auto loans, student debt, and credit card balances have all climbed to record levels, with revolving credit alone hitting $1.2 trillion after another sharp increase over the past year.\n\nAs borrowing costs rise and savings thin out, more Americans are falling behind on their bills. Serious delinquencies—people who are at least 90 days late—have now surpassed 3 percent, a threshold not seen since before the last financial crisis. Student loan borrowers are under even greater strain: more than 14 percent became severely overdue in the most recent quarter, marking the worst level in the Fed’s data history.\n\nMeanwhile, prices for essentials remain well above pre-pandemic levels, and inflation—while lower than during Trump’s first term—has proven stubborn.\n\nGrocery bills remain elevated, rents have surged in most major metros, and energy analysts warn that winter heating costs could jump again this year. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Economic Research Service, food-at-home prices rose by about 2.7 percent in the 12 months ending September 2025.\n\nThat has had an impact on how middle-class voters view Trump and the economy. The latest YouGov/Economist poll showed that only 24 percent of middle class voters rate the economy as good or excellent, while 38 percent rate it as poor, while 52 percent say the economy is getting worse.\n\nAnd middle class voters are also not optimistic about the future. Only 30 percent of the demographic think they will be better off in a years time.\n\n“Most voters mostly want things to work. They want to be able to buy gas and groceries, take care of their families, and know their children will have a chance at a good future. When things aren’t working, they blame the people in charge. Increasing numbers of people think things aren’t working and have no chance of getting better soon. President Trump is in charge, so increasing numbers of voters blame President Trump,” Peter Loge, director of the Project on Ethics in Political Communication at George Washington University, told Newsweek.\n\nThe administration, aware of the mounting frustration, has begun floating new policy ideas aimed at easing household pressures. Among them is Trump’s proposal to introduce 50-year mortgages as a way to lower monthly payments for homebuyers.\n\nBut not all of Trump’s party supports his plan. “I don’t like 50-year mortgages as the solution to the housing affordability crisis,” Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia wrote on X.\n\n“It will ultimately reward banks, mortgage lenders and home builders while people pay far more in interest over time and die before they ever pay off their home.”\n\nA 50-year home loan would spread payments over a much longer timeline, reducing the monthly burden but dramatically increasing the total amount paid over the life of the mortgage, while housing economists note that stretching repayment out for a...","summary":"YouGov/Economist polling over the past three months shows a clear downward trend in Trump’s standing with middle-class Americans.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/americas-middle-class-turns-on-trump-amid-affordability-crisis-11049058","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AP25317132313957-1.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-16 10:00:00","author":"Martha McHardy","authors":["Martha McHardy"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.183},{"id":379519586,"title":"Michelle Obama Asked If US Is Ready To Have Woman President.

Why He Faces High Hurdles","text":"US President Donald Trump, unswayed by the BBC's apology and resignations of its top officials, is persisting with his threat to sue the network for as much as $5 billion despite significant legal barriers to prove he was deliberately defamed.\"I think I have to do it,\" Trump told reporters on Air Force One on Friday, continuing his quest to punish the British television network over an edit of his January 6, 2021, speech that made it seem he was directly calling for violence at the US Capitol.The effort faces a host of legal questions.First, it's not clear that US courts even have jurisdiction, given that the documentary never aired in the US and was geo-blocked in the US on the BBC's streaming service.The president would also need to prove that the BBC had acted with \"actual malice\" toward him when it edited the documentary - a high bar required for public figures that was established by the US Supreme Court in 1964 in order to protect free speech.\"They've got to meet the actual malice standard with New York Times versus Sullivan, which is a very tough standard,\" said Gregory Germain, a professor at Syracuse University College of Law. Trump is \"the ultimate public figure.\"Trump's lawyer said in a Nov. 9 letter to the British Broadcasting Corp. that it had until Friday evening to issue an apology, retract the Panorama documentary at the center of the dispute and offer financial compensation for \"harm caused\" - or face a $1 billion defamation lawsuit.\"The damages he asked for were completely unrealistic and he would be very unlikely to recover anywhere near that,\" said Lyrissa Lidsky, a professor at University of Florida Levin College of Law. \"He's claiming reputational harm but he won the presidency afterwards.\"The BBC met some of Trump's demands on Thursday when it issued a formal apology and retracted the broadcast, titled \"Trump: A Second Chance,\" which aired a week before the 2024 presidential election. That followed the surprise resignations of BBC Director-General Tim Davie and head of news Deborah Turness days earlier. But no compensation was offered.'Sincerely Regrets'\"While the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim,\" the broadcaster said in a statement.The White House referred a request to comment to Trump's lawyer, Alejandro Brito, who didn't immediately respond to an email.On Thursday, after the BBC apology, a spokesman for Trump's legal team said \"It is now clear that BBC engaged in a pattern of defamation against President Trump by intentionally and deceitfully editing his historic speech in order to try and interfere in the Presidential Election.\"The BBC's editing spliced together two parts of Trump's speech before the riot in a way that gave the impression of a direct call for violence. While more than a thousand Trump supporters invaded the Capitol building, injuring 140 police officers and causing millions of dollars in damage, his speech never directly called for the attack.The time limit for filing defamation lawsuits in the UK is one year, meaning it's too late for Trump to sue there. His lawyer has said the suit will be filed in Florida.Fighting the MediaThe case, if filed, would also have to surmount another legal standard that protects publications that are \"substantially true,\" Germain said. The remarks that were spliced together were both things Trump said, even if the edit was poorly done, he said.\"I don't think they should win a Pulitzer Prize for the editing, but it's not defamatory,\" Germain said. \"What he's alleging is that he doesn't like the way they edited the video, he's not alleging that they posted a deep fake or something.\"A lawsuit against the BBC would add to a growing list of complaints Trump has filed against news outlets he claims have treated him unfairly, including recent multi-billion cases he has pending against the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, both of which deny wrongdoing.CBS agreed to pay $16 million to settle Trump's suit accusing it of election interference over how the network's 60 Minutes edited a quote from an interview with presidential candidate Kamala Harris, which he claimed smoothed out a meandering answer. ABC paid a similar amount to settle a suit over news host George Stephanopoulos's incorrect reference to Trump being \"found liable for rape\" in a suit by E. Jean Carroll, while the jury had only found him liable for sexual abuse. The jury had rejected Carroll's rape claim.Benjamin Zipursky, a professor at Fordham Law School in New York, said a lawsuit by Trump against the BBC would likely fail because the Supreme Court has long recognized \"the importance of not chilling political speech with the threat of lawsuits.\"\"It's the entire foundation of the Supreme Court's protection of free speech that threats of costly lawsuits could cause the media to censor itself, and this case is a dramatic example of that,\" Zipursky said.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)","summary":"Donald Trump said he would sue the BBC over an edit of his January 6, 2021, speech that made it seem he was directly calling for violence at the US Capitol.","url":"https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-says-he-will-sue-bbc-for-5-billion-over-january-6-us-capitolvideo-edit-look-at-why-he-faces-high-hurdles-9644482","image":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2025-11/b4vhq8bg_donald-trump-afp_625x300_07_November_25.jpeg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-16 06:21:45","author":"Erik Larson","authors":["Erik Larson"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.259},{"id":379452244,"title":"‘Lying political pr******te’: Laura Loomer unleashes vicious attack on Marjorie Taylor Greene as feud deepens with Trump","text":"Since US President Donald Trump broke up with Georgia congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, politically, MAGA influencer Laura Loomer found new prey. Loomer launched a series of posts on X, hurling insults at Greene and accusing her of hypocrisy over immigration and visa policies, Daily Beast reported.The tirade was triggered by an X post Greene made, complaining about skilled visa programmes, writing, “We must stop importing the world replacing highly qualified American jobs! It’s the most insulting America last policy being continued.”An incensed Loomer responded with a post of her own, beginning: “Why is @mtgreenee such a two-faced, lying political prostitute? I oppose H1Bs and illegal immigration, but it was Marjorie Traitor Greene who spent Christmas in 2024 defending H1Bs. It was MTG who said we need to give jobs to illegal Aliens so she can keep having the ability to hire illegal aliens to work at her construction company.”Loomer continued: “Now she’s pretending like we don’t have the receipts. She is a chameleon, willing to say and do anything depending on who she is speaking to. What is it MTG? Do we need to import illegals to work at your ex-husband’s construction company, or do we need to stop replacing American jobs? You lying b---h. You’re finally finished.”She included a clip of Greene’s appearance on The Tim Dillon Show podcast last month, in which Greene said, “As a conservative, and as a business owner in the construction industry, and as a realist, we have to do something about labor and that needs to be a smarter plan than just rounding up every single person and deporting them just like that.” Greene was referring to mass deportations under Trump and argued for an “off-ramp” to reduce reliance on undocumented labour.Loomer had earlier criticised Greene on X, writing, “We need to put AMERICAN workers first. We don’t need to be coddling and protecting big corporations that evade the law to hire cheap illegal aliens.” She also called the congresswoman a “sell-out” who was trying to save her own construction company. Greene and her ex-husband, Perry Greene, were vice-president and president, respectively, of Taylor Commercial as of 2019, but she no longer plays a significant role in the business.Over the weekend, Loomer made several posts targeting Real America’s Voice chief White House correspondent Brian Glenn, who is Greene’s partner. “He’s just a simp for @mtgreenee,” Loomer said of Glenn. “Zero talent, and he only got the press pass because he’s having sex with MTG. Everyone knows it’s true... Having her boyfriend in the White House is a liability for President Trump. BAN Brian Glenn from the White House press pool.”In lengthy posts, Loomer also suggested Greene had accepted money from a foreign entity to go “anti-Trump”. “What you’re seeing now is a foreign influence operation to destroy MAGA. Doesn’t anyone find it weird how MTG went from warning we will have Sharia Law to now downplaying it and aligning with @RoKhanna to accuse Trump of being a pedophile?” she wrote. Loomer also accused the congresswoman of becoming so “filled with rage because she couldn’t handle the idea of another woman in MAGA having success” that she worked with a foreign agent ”who was accused of molesting underage boys” to smear Loomer and plant a “hit piece” in The New York Times.The feud between Loomer and Greene has been ongoing for over a year. Greene previously criticised Loomer for posting an “extremely racist” message about Vice President Kamala Harris during the 2024 presidential campaign, while Loomer hit back over Greene’s attendance at a football game with the President as Hurricane ravaged Georgia.On Saturday, Loomer celebrated Trump adopting a nickname she coined for Greene four years ago after the President wrote on Truth Social, ”Marjorie ‘Traitor’ Greene is a disgrace to our GREAT REPUBLICAN PARTY!”Sharing texts she had sent to the President, Greene wrote on X, ”I have supported President Trump with too much of my precious time, too much of my own money, and fought harder for him even when almost all other Republicans turned their back and denounced him.” She added, ”But I don’t worship or serve Donald Trump. I worship God, Jesus is my savior, and I serve my district GA14 and the American people.”","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/lying-political-prte-laura-loomer-unleashes-vicious-attack-on-marjorie-taylor-greene-as-feud-deepens-with-trump/articleshow/125359567.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-125359961/125359961.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-16 05:22:00","author":"Toi World Desk","authors":["Toi World Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.406},{"id":379430056,"title":"Albom: Careful with that splice! How Trump’s BBC edit reflects a bigger journalism issue","text":"Last week, President Donald Trump threatened to sue the British Broadcasting Corporation for splicing together two of his sound bites to make it sound like one. \n\nHe could have blamed the French. \n\nAfter all, it was a French magician, George Méliès, who, in the late 19th century, accidentally invented the editing technique that ultimately led, 130 years later, to the BBC’s faux pas. \n\nMore Albom: Mitch Albom: Hindsight is 20/20, but Dan Campbell calling Lions plays was forward thinking\n\nMéliès was filming a street scene in France when his crank-up camera jammed. He eventually got it rolling again and continued shooting. \n\nOnly when he developed the film did he see that a carriage that had been in his lens suddenly turned into a hearse. \n\nOf course, we now know it was two scenes that the camera, by stopping and starting, had accidentally — yet seamlessly — edited together. Kind of like what the BBC did. \n\nMinus the “accidentally” part. \n\nWhat a difference a splice makes. \n\nDid BBC intend The Edit? \n\nLet’s talk about The Edit. It is journalism’s most significant and least discussed shaper of public opinion. In its most benign form, The Edit — jump cutting, cutaways, trimmed sound bites, selective quotes — simply shortens things without changing the meaning or intent. \n\nIn its most harmful form, The Edit completely distorts. \n\nBut in all cases, The Edit it is not, as journalists like to aspire to, the purist reflection of the truth. \n\nWhich is what makes it so dangerous. \n\nThe BBC shot itself in the foot when, in a show last year called \"Panorama,\" it stitched together two sound bites from Trump’s infamous Jan. 6, 2021, speech. \n\nIn reality, Trump said, “We are going to walk down to the Capitol and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.” \n\nThen, over 50 minutes later, he made the comment, “And we fight. We fight like hell.” \n\nThe \"Panorama\" program took part of the first quote, connected it to the second, and aired this: \n\n“We are going to walk down to the Capitol … and I’ll be with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.” \n\nWhen played that way, it sounds like Trump was marching in front of an angry army, exhorting it to fight like hell every step of the way. \n\nBut he never actually said that. And, no matter how awful the events of Jan. 6 may have been, no amount of mea culpas will convince any skeptic that the BBC did this in error. \n\nAt best, whoever edited it believed that the two sentences were essentially the same sentiment. At worst, it was deliberately done to make Trump look bad. (Or worse than he already did.) \n\nEither way, it’s not honest journalism. But it is hardly the first, tenth, thousandth or millionth time such a thing has been done. \n\nEditing is part of journalism \n\nAs a journalist, let me be blunt. Everyone in our business edits in some fashion. \n\nThere’s the obvious video cuts, sound trims or print ellipsis which reduce the length of a comment. There’s the “cutaway,” where the TV camera goes to the reporter’s face nodding, while the sound of the interviewee is being cut from one point and attached to another. \n\nBut there’s more. Whenever reporters decide which quotes or sound bites to include and which to leave out, they are editing. Whenever editors decide what part of the story to reflect in the headline or commercial tease, they are editing. \n\nWhenever higher-ups choose what page to place the story, or where it goes in the newscast, they are editing. \n\nBecause all these decisions affect the way the reader/viewer/listener perceives the otherwise “pure” truth of the story, which would be to basically hold a mirror up from its first moment to its last. \n\nTrump may play the aggrieved party over the BBC incident, but it is hardly new. Last year, Democrats filed formal complaints with Fox News about their editing of a Trump interview on the Jeffrey Epstein files. We all remember the complaints about CBS’ editing of its Kamala Harris and Kristi Noem interviews, allegedly to make one look bad and one good. \n\nIn 2012, NBC News was sued after an editor spliced George Zimmerman’s emergency 911 call concerning Travon Martin. In the actual call, Zimmerman told the dispatcher, “This guy looks like he’s up to no good, or he’s on drugs or something. It’s raining and he’s just walking around, looking about.” \n\nWhen the dispatcher asked Zimmerman if the person was white, Black or Hispanic, he said, “He looks Black.” \n\nThe NBC edit had Zimmerman saying, “This guy looks like he’s up to no good. He looks Black.” \n\nWhat a difference a splice makes. \n\n‘Consistent application’ not always applied \n\nAs a result of the BBC’s \"Panorama\" debacle, its director general and head of news both resigned. The BBC has apologized to Trump (he’d demanded this) but has refused to agree to pay him compensation (which he’s also demanded). \n\nBritain’s culture secretary — yes, they have one of those — told the media that the BBC’s editorial standards were \"in some cases not robust enough and in other cases not consistently applied.\" \n\nThose words, “consistently applied,” may be the most insidious part of this whole problem. We journalists can hide behind “everybody edits, there’s not enough space to print/play everything!” \n\nBut choosing what image to keep and what to cut, what sound to play first and what immediately follows, where to put the ellipsis in the paragraph and where to pick up — “consistent application” — are all individual decisions that, quite often, are not scrutinized enough, and can be the difference in presenting someone as positive or as negative. \n\nSometimes journalists figure “it’s obvious these are two different moments.” But that is assuming the viewer understands how the business works. Too often, people just watch a string of comments by a newsmaker, stitched together by a news outlet, and assume that everything that person says is of that ilk. (Cable news programs do this all the time.) \n\nAnd nobody — expect perhaps the injured party — complains. \n\nMore of us should. Like many things with Trump, the president is an unlikely (and sometimes unlikeable) example of a point that is still important. And in this case, critical. \n\nIn a world of artificial intelligence, where we very soon will not be able to tell what is real and what is not — even in front of our eyes — trusting journalists with what they present may be the only way of getting to the truth. \n\nWith such a heavy burden in our hands, we should be highly careful of where we make our cuts. And ask ourselves if, like Méliès’ broken camera, we are turning a carriage into a hearse. The editing button is not meant to be a weapon. Unfortunately, it makes a very good one. \n\nContact Mitch Albom: malbom@freepress.com. Check out the latest updates with his charities, books and events at MitchAlbom.com.

However, she has repeatedly dismissed such suggestions, stating in 2016, ahead of the Trump-Clinton race, “I will not run for president. No, nope, not going to do it.” Similar rumours resurfaced during the 2024 presidential election, which featured a contest between Joe Biden and Donald Trump.During that election cycle, Obama campaigned actively for Kamala Harris, who had emerged as the Democratic front-runner amid voter dissatisfaction with President Biden. At a rally in Michigan, she warned against re-electing Trump, emphasising the risks to women’s health and rights. “Please, please do not hand our fates over to the likes of Trump, who knows nothing about us and has shown deep contempt for us.

The towering an youngest member of the Trump family was caught on camera as he passed along a secret message to the then-outgoing US President Joe Biden. Many believed that the NYU student may have dropped an expletive-laden bomb on the Democratic leader, especially since his father had taken back his presidential seat at the White House for the second time. Despite the mystery surrounding the Barron-Biden moment swelling up with no real answer in sight, netizens had convinced themselves that the youngest Trump had been a bad guy. Eric Trump opens up about Barron Trump's 7-word message to Biden Barron's elder brother, Eric Trump has finally dispelled the falsity around the viral Trump inauguration moment.

Something very respectful.\" Viral Barron Trump moment at January inauguration While he finally addressed the issue on Megyn Kelly's show, Eric also revealed that Barron's viral moment had become a talking point even in a previous interview.

First, it’s not clear that US courts even have jurisdiction, given that the documentary never aired in the US and was geo-blocked in the US on the BBC’s streaming service.The president would also need to prove that the BBC had acted with “actual malice” toward him when it edited the documentary — a high bar required for public figures that was established by the US Supreme Court in 1964 in order to protect free speech.“They’ve got to meet the actual malice standard with New York Times versus Sullivan, which is a very tough standard,” said Gregory Germain, a professor at Syracuse University College of Law. Trump is “the ultimate public figure.”Trump’s lawyer said in a Nov. 9 letter to the British Broadcasting Corp. that it had until Friday evening to issue an apology, retract the Panorama documentary at the centre of the dispute and offer financial compensation for “harm caused” — or face a $1 billion defamation lawsuit.“The damages he asked for were completely unrealistic, and he would be very unlikely to recover anywhere near that,” said Lyrissa Lidsky, a professor at the University of Florida Levin College of Law. “He’s claiming reputational harm, but he won the presidency afterwards.”The BBC met some of Trump’s demands on Thursday when it issued a formal apology and retracted the broadcast, titled “Trump: A Second Chance,” which aired a week before the 2024 presidential election. That followed the surprise resignations of BBC Director-General Tim Davie and head of news Deborah Turness days earlier. But no compensation was offered..“While the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree that there is a basis for a defamation claim,” the broadcaster said in a statement.The White House referred a request to comment to Trump’s lawyer, Alejandro Brito, who didn’t immediately respond to an email.On Thursday, after the BBC apology, a spokesman for Trump’s legal team said, “It is now clear that the BBC engaged in a pattern of defamation against President Trump by intentionally and deceitfully editing his historic speech in order to try and interfere in the Presidential Election.”The BBC’s editing spliced together two parts of Trump’s speech before the riot in a way that gave the impression of a direct call for violence. While more than a thousand Trump supporters invaded the Capitol building, injuring 140 police officers and causing millions of dollars in damage, his speech never directly called for the attack.The time limit for filing defamation lawsuits in the UK is one year, meaning it’s too late for Trump to sue there. His lawyer has said the suit will be filed in Florida..The case, if filed, would also have to surmount another legal standard that protects publications that are “substantially true,” Germain said. The remarks that were spliced together were both things Trump said, even if the edit was poorly done, he said.“I don’t think they should win a Pulitzer Prize for the editing, but it’s not defamatory,” Germain said. “What he’s alleging is that he doesn’t like the way they edited the video; he’s not alleging that they posted a deep fake or something.”A lawsuit against the BBC would add to a growing list of complaints Trump has filed against news outlets he claims have treated him unfairly, including recent multi-billion-dollar cases he has pending against the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, both of which deny wrongdoing.CBS agreed to pay $16 million to settle Trump’s suit accusing it of election interference over how the network’s 60 Minutes edited a quote from an interview with presidential candidate Kamala Harris, which he claimed smoothed out a meandering answer. ABC paid a similar amount to settle a suit over news host George Stephanopoulos’s incorrect reference to Trump being “found liable for rape” in a suit by E. Jean Carroll, while the jury had only found him liable for sexual abuse. The jury had rejected Carroll’s rape claim.Benjamin Zipursky, a professor at Fordham Law School in New York, said a lawsuit by Trump against the BBC would likely fail because the Supreme Court has long recognised “the importance of not chilling political speech with the threat of lawsuits.”“It’s the entire foundation of the Supreme Court’s protection of free speech that threats of costly lawsuits could cause the media to censor itself, and this case is a dramatic example of that,” Zipursky said..Donald Trump Discloses $82 Million In Bond Purchases Since August: Report","summary":"It's not clear that US courts even have jurisdiction, given that the documentary never aired in the US and was geo-blocked in the US on the BBC's streaming service.","url":"https://www.ndtvprofit.com/world/trump-threat-to-sue-bbc-over-speech-edit-faces-high-hurdles","image":"https://media.assettype.com/bloombergquint/2025-09-02/ggibmm52/TRUMP-4.jpg?w=1200&h=675&auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&enlarge=true","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-16 03:26:22","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.193},{"id":379412432,"title":"From ‘future star’ to ‘traitor’: How Trump’s MAGA warrior Marjorie Taylor Greene lost the president","text":"Few allies can remain in Donald Trump’s good graces forever. \n\nJust ask his former lawyer-turned-critic Michael Cohen; or his first-term vice president Mike Pence, targeted by members of the January 6 mob who called for his hanging; or the president’s on-again, off-again “first buddy” Elon Musk, with whom Trump waged a very public online flamewar this summer over Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nFor a while, it seemed like far-right congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene might be the one who bucked the trend, but now it seems her time has come, too.\n\nThe president has branded Greene, once one of his fiercest allies in Washington, D.C., a “traitor.” He said he’s open to endorsing a primary challenger against the Georgia Republican. \n\nSo where did it all go wrong?\n\nThe most immediate cause of the split is the Epstein scandal. \n\nGreene is among several Republican members of Congress who have backed an effort to force the government to release more files on the late sex offender, a longtime former friend of the president’s who died in prison while awaiting trial on charges that he trafficked young girls. The House will vote on the effort next week. \n\nWorse still, in a Republican party that virtually never openly criticizes Trump, Greene accused Trump of a “huge miscalculation” in his continued dismissal of the scandal and the Republicans pushing for more information.\n\n“Just being very honest with you, it’s something that I don’t understand,” the MAGA rep told CBS, arguing that releasing more Epstein information in the hands of federal law enforcement sends a powerful message that the government “will not protect the predators,” even if they are tied to rich and influential people. \n\nThe president, who denies being involved in any wrongdoing tied to Epstein, has called Republicans pursuing the Epstein scandal “stupid” and accused them of distracting from GOP achievements. \n\nBut the tension between Greene and Trump’s inner circle has been building for months. \n\nGreene, once better known for spouting conspiracy theories and demonizing her progressive colleagues when she entered Congress in 2021, has recently turned her considerable bully pulpit towards major parts of the Republican agenda.\n\nShe has hammered the GOP across the board, taking aim at its continued dithering on lowering health care costs.\n\nDuring the recent government shutdown, she broke from her party to join Democratic members in calling for action to keep expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies in place, though she was ultimately ignored.\n\nShe has also accused the president of abandoning Trump’s “America First” agenda by focusing too much on foreign intervention, emerging as an outspoken critic of the bipartisan support for the Israeli war effort in Gaza, and becoming one of the few American lawmakers from either party to agree with a consensus among human rights groups and a United Nations commission that have labelled the conflict a genocide.\n\nLast year, she mounted a failed attempt to oust her former ally Mike Johnson as Speaker of the House, and she has accused the top House Republican of fostering an environment that sidelines powerful women in the party, a charge she applied to the president on Saturday amid her ongoing feud.\n\n“Republicans don’t have support from women and this right here is a perfect example of why,” she wrote on X, linking back to a series of posts from Trump and allied GOP Rep. Troy Nehls dismissing the Epstein scandal as a Democratic “hoax.”\n\nThe weekend blow-up is a dramatic change from Greene’s rapid rise through MAGA world.\n\nGreene said she was inspired to seek office because of Trump, and the president praised her as a “future Republican star” and “real winner” after she won her first primary in 2020.\n\nOnce she took office, the two moved in lockstep. She wore a “Trump won” mask on the House floor at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic as she unleashed a months-long campaign against vaccination efforts and public health guidelines.\n\nTrump defended Greene after her colleagues moved to strip her from committee assignments over past inflammatory comments, while she backed the president as he and his allies in Congress sought to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election on baseless conspiracy theories that the results were rigged against him.\n\nGreene would go on to be the first of Georgia’s congressional delegation to endorse Trump for re-election in 2022, a time when the president’s political stocks were at a low ebb following a brutal round of impeachment trials and committee investigations that examined in detail how he nearly toppled a rightful election.\n\nGreene’s split with Trump is certainly notable, but those who go against the president have a way of burning brightly then fading to irrelevance within the party.\n\nFormer Republican congresswoman Liz Cheney, who supported the second Trump impeachment and helped lead the January 6 committee, lost her primary in 2022 then decided to back Democratic candidate Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. \n\nPence is now a marginal figure in the party, while Musk — despite a brief handshake with Trump in September at the funeral of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk — is no longer the omni-present fixture he was in Washington during the first months of the second Trump administration.\n\nGreene may have provoked Trump’s fury, but some in the Republican camp remain supportive of the Georgia rep.\n\n“I respect President Trump but I stand with my Congresswoman,” Emory Roy, Georgia-based activist for the conservative group Turning Point Action wrote on X, calling Greene “an America First fighter in D.C.”\n\nJim Tully, chairman of the local Republican party in the district Greene represents, wrote on X that the congresswoman enjoys the district’s “unwavering support.”\n\n“Her willingness to speak candidly on behalf of her constituents, even in the face of political pressure, underscores her courage and her fidelity to her oath,” he added.","summary":"After months of tension on everything from Epstein to inflation, Trump breaks up with his former die-hard ally","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-marjorie-taylor-greene-epstein-b2866061.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/11/16/1/26/FILES-US-POLITICS-TRUMP-GREENE-ka2gl1m7.jpeg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/UBuoNT2c-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-11-16 02:50:17","author":"Josh Marcus","authors":["Josh Marcus"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.26},{"id":379412706,"title":"The Socialist Mayor Clown Show Is Truly Something To Behold","text":"The progressive left never admits they are wrong and they always double down on failure. This is the mindset that continues to lead Democrats down a path of self destruction along with the cities they inhabit. One cannot separate the ongoing decline of US cities from far-left policies; one precipitates the other. \n\nThe implosion of Joe Biden's faux presidency and the defeat of the Kamala Harris campaign left Democrats reeling and searching for answers, but it didn't take long for them to dismiss the idea of self reflection and come to the predictably insane conclusion they are right and everyone else is the enemy.\n\nThe answer, they argue, is not to abandon their radical ideology and find their way back to common sense. Rather, they believe that they lost the elections because their candidates were \"not extreme enough.\"\n\nBut what could possibly be more extreme than Biden's mass online censorship campaign? His calls for pandemic vaccine passports for Americans to keep their jobs? His implementation of DEI and CRT programs across the federal government and the US military? His consistent denials over the stagflation crisis? When he declared Easter Sunday as \"Transgender Day of Visibility?\" What about the topless LGBT parties on the White House Lawn? \n\nHow much worse can a political leader get? Well, we're about to find out.\n\nDemocrats in cities like Chicago, New York and now Seattle have decided to replace their bumbling leftist mayors with more openly socialist mayors and the trend is likely to grow. This seems to be a calculated reformation of the Democrat base around increasingly more militant Marxist policies, using blue cities as a \"proving ground.\" \n\nIt makes sense when one considers how freely groups like Antifa and anti-ICE are able to operate, with clear coordination between radicals and the local government. These are places where activists feel most safe and comfortable because they are protected by resident politicians and police. Blue cities are becoming experimental playgrounds for color revolution and socialist policies that would never be allowed anywhere else. \n\nThey see these cities as toys to be played with. The problem is, their initiatives are falling apart before they get into office and conservatives haven't had to lift a finger.\n\nFor example, Zohran Mamdani's campaign promises are drying up on the vine like grapes in the desert sun. His supporters are now realizing that his 4-year rent freeze policy faces serious obstacles, with the new mayor relying on full support from the Rent Guidelines Board (RGB) appointed by Mayor Adams (which he is unlikely to get until a new board is appointed). The reality is, a rent freeze would result in an immediate selloff of rental properties and landlord flight from NYC, meaning, there will be an even worse housing shortage.\n\nMamdani also got word from Governor Kathy Hochul that she will not be backing his fare free bus service concept, nor will she support his universal childcare program. In other words, Mamdani doesn't have the authority to fulfill his campaign promises. \n\nMamdani is confronted by the fact Gov. Hochul said she won’t fund the free buses proposal part of his socialist agenda.\nHe responds by saying he’ll find the money.\nMamdani’s supporters have been duped.\nHe can’t pay for his socialism.\n(nbcnewyork on TT) pic.twitter.com/UCPfoo7s2t\n— Paul A. Szypula 🇺🇸 (@Bubblebathgirl) November 13, 2025\n\nFurthermore, if the \"Democratic socialist\" gets approval from all parties involved he still has to deal with Trump's inevitable cuts to to federal dollars. NYC gets around $10 billion in direct federal aid and over $100 billion in federal funding through a variety of avenues. Even with all that cash, the city is still in the hole and desperate for relief after the Democrats disastrous migrant housing programs which crippled their subsidies for the homeless. \n\nThe loss of a mere $10 billion could cause chaos for NYC's budget concerns and all of Mamdani's projects require an increasing budget, not a falling budget. \n\nRecently elected mayor of Seattle, Katie Wilson, is causing a stir as well with her socialist rhetoric. Her notions come off as unpracticed or poorly thought-out and one wonders if Democrats will feel any buyers remorse. Seattle was already in steep decline due to wealth taxation, which has driven numerous companies out of the area along with thousands of jobs and revenues. \n\nSOCIALISM: Seattle mayor-elect Katie Wilson promises a full socialist smorgasbord, calling for guaranteed housing, universal child care, free K-8 summer care, social housing, and shifting land and wealth from corporations to community control. pic.twitter.com/GvmqFn8Yn2\n— @amuse (@amuse) November 14, 2025\n\nWilson's utopian wish list is facing a hard reality check and she hasn't clocked in on the job yet. For example, she believes she has the power to prevent grocery chains from leaving the city and creating \"food deserts\". It's a problem that has been accelerating in blue cities across he country largely due to lax law enforcement policies and low criminal prosecution.

According to former First Lady Michelle Obama, the answer is no. She said the country is still not prepared for a female president and that the US has “a lot of growing up to do.”“As we saw in this past election, sadly, we ain’t ready,” Obama said. “That’s why I’m like, don’t even look at me about running, because you all are lying.

You are not.” President Donald Trump defeated former vice president Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.Obama made the remarks during a November 5 conversation at the Brooklyn Academy of Music for her podcast. The discussion with actor Tracee Ellis Ross centred on Obama’s new book, “The Look.”Ross had asked Obama if she felt that the first lady role, serving as an archetype for “wifedom and femininity,” had affected “the room that we’ve made for a woman to be president.” “You know, we got a lot of growing up to do, and there’s still, sadly, a lot of men who do not feel like they can be led by a woman, and we saw it,” Obama continued.Obama stumped for Harris on the 2024 campaign trail, drawing large crowds to campaign events, advocating for women’s health care and pleading with men to vote for Harris. The former first lady has faced speculation and calls to run for president but has repeatedly said she does not want to seek the Oval Office.","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/youre-lying-youre-not-ready-michelle-obama-drops-truth-bomb-when-asked-if-us-is-ready-for-its-first-female-president/articleshow/125358252.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-125358325/125358325.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-16 01:10:00","author":"Toi World Desk","authors":["Toi World Desk"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.049},{"id":379398360,"title":"Michelle Obama responds to calls for a 2028 presidential run","text":"Michelle Obama isn’t buying the idea that Americans truly want her to run for president.\n\nMichelle's recent refusal came while speaking at the Brooklyn Academy of Music on November 5 about her new book, The Look.\n\nDuring the live talk, the former first lady, 61, said people should stop pretending they’re ready for a woman in the White House.\n\nReferencing Donald Trump’s 2024 win over Kamala Harris, she said, “Sadly, we ain’t ready.” \n\n“You’re not ready for a woman.

The shift, Enten argued, is not some small wobble. It is a collapse.\n\nBolduan started with the obvious question. “Have polls always been down for Trump when it comes to inflation?” she asked.\n\n“No, no, not at all,” Enten replied. He pointed back to October 2024 when Trump was still seen as the stronger hand on the cost of living. “Go back to October of 2024. Who did Americans trust more on inflation, Kamala Harris or Donald Trump? They trusted Donald Trump by nine points on average.”\n\nThat cushion is gone because, according to Enten, those same surveys now show Trump’s net approval on inflation “way, way, way underwater, 26 points underwater on his net approval on inflation.”\n\nThe message to Trump was sharp with the data analyst stating, “So it’s not that the polls are fake, it’s that the American people have turned against you, Mr. President, you’ve gone from leading by nine points on inflation to being 26 points underwater. You’re doing something very wrong in the minds of the American public.”\n\nBolduan did not sugarcoat it. “Negative 26. That’s a problem,” she said.\n\nFor Trump, who has spent months claiming that survey firms underestimate his support, there was more bad news. Enten gamed out the former president’s favorite hypothetical, that the polling is simply off the way it was in 2024.\n\n“You see this switcheroo, right, going from plus 9 to minus 26. That’s a move of over 30 points in the wrong direction,” Enten said. “But let’s say the polls are off. Let’s take up Donald Trump on his hypothetical, right? Oh, the polls always underestimate me. Well, here’s Trump’s net approval rating on inflation. Currently, he’s 26 points below water. If the polls are off like they were in 2024, he still got a Titanic sized problem. He’s then 24 points underwater on inflation.”\n\nIn other words, even if the survey error breaks exactly the way Trump says it will, he is still in dreadful shape with voters on the issue they say matters most.\n\n“So yes, the polls underestimated him, but just by about a point and a half in 2024,” Enten continued. “He would still have a massive, massive, massive problem on inflation even if the polls were off like they were a year ago.”\n\nAnd there is another risk for Trump and his party as Enten noted that in recent races “the polls are absolutely awful” at catching late Democratic strength, pointing to contests in Virginia and New Jersey where Democrats Mikie Sherrill and Abigail Spanberger beat their polling by sizable margins. That raises the possibility that Republicans are being overestimated this time, not shortchanged.\n\n“The bottom line is this, the polls on inflation are absolutely awful for Donald Trump,” Enten concluded. “Even if they were slightly better, he’d still be way, way below water. But the problem … might be even worse than the polls suggest.” Voters do not need a chart to know why, he added, because “people feel it in their pocketbooks every day and they see it as the prices climb ever higher when they try and purchase their groceries.”\n\nFor a president who built his brand on economic swagger, that kind of slide is not just a bad news cycle. It is a warning flare.","summary":"Trump insists the polls are fake, but new data shows his inflation numbers sinking fast.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/trumps-economic-numbers-are-falling-apart-and-the-real-picture-could-be-worse","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/donald-trump-8.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-15 23:30:26","author":"Frank Yemi","authors":["Frank Yemi"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.724},{"id":379408124,"title":"DHS says immigration agents 'surging' to Charlotte as city officials warn residents","text":"Department of Homeland Security agents are \"surging\" to Charlotte, North Carolina, on Saturday, Nov. 15, to \"ensure Americans are safe and public safety threats are removed,\" according to department spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin.\n\n“Americans should be able to live without fear of violent criminal illegal aliens hurting them, their families, or their neighbors,\" said McLaughlin, the DHS assistant secretary for public affairs, in a statement emailed to USA TODAY on Nov. 15.\n\n\"We are surging DHS law enforcement to Charlotte to ensure Americans are safe and public safety threats are removed,\" McLaughlin said. \"There have been too many victims of criminal illegal aliens, and President Trump and Secretary Noem will step up to protect Americans when sanctuary politicians won’t.”\n\nThe arrival of federal agents comes as President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown expands to more Democratic-run cities, including Charlotte, led by Democratic Mayor Vi Lyles.\n\nIn response to DHS's efforts, the city of Charlotte's government shared a statement on Nov. 15: \"The expected U.S. Customs and Border Protection's operations are causing unnecessary fear and uncertainty in our community as recent operations in other cities have resulted in people without criminal records being detained and violent protests being the result of unwarranted actions.\"\n\nAdditionally, the city's government said in its statement that anyone who needs \"the police, don't hesitate to call 911. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department does not participate in Immigration and Customs Enforcement or U.S. Customs and Border Protection operations and is not involved in the planning or execution of any federal immigration enforcement activities.\"\n\nThe city also asked community members who want to make their voices heard, \"do so peacefully,\" as local officials \"do not want to see violence like many witnessed in other cities.\"\n\nWhat is DHS doing in Charlotte?\n\nBefore the announced deployment, Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry L. McFadden said on Nov. 13 that federal officials had not disclosed any specific details about DHS's operation, including how many agents would be sent to the city or what their mission would entail. The sheriff added that his agency would not be \"involved with any measures regarding enforcement with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and CBP.\"\n\nCharlotte, the largest city in North Carolina, is a Democratic stronghold in a state that Trump won during last year's presidential election. In Mecklenburg County, Democratic nominee Kamala Harris received 66% of the vote while Trump won the state by four percentage points.\n\nLyles, in a Nov. 13 X post, said local officials didn't know what immigration authorities were planning to do in Charlotte, but she asked residents to remain calm.\n\n\"I understand this news will create uncertainty and anxiety for many people in our community,\" Lyles said on X. \"Everyone in our community deserves to feel secure and I am committed to doing all that I can to inform our community, help make sure everyone feels safe, and understands their rights.\"\n\nAccording to the Charlotte Observer, \"masked federal agents\" made their presence known Saturday, Nov. 15, including at a church in east Charlotte.\n\n“Right now, everybody is scared. Everybody,” the church's pastor, who did not want to identify himself to the outlet, said. “One of these guys with immigration, he say he was going to arrest one of the other guys in the church. He pushed him.”\n\nWhich other cities have federal agents been deployed to?\n\nWhile McLaughlin did not elaborate further on DHS's operation, the \"surge\" into Charlotte comes after federal agents have been deployed to Los Angeles, Washington, DC, Memphis, Chicago and Portland. The deployments of federal agents and National Guard troops have been challenged in court and have drawn criticism over officers' use of force and what's been seen as increasingly aggressive tactics by the Trump administration.\n\nLate last month, Trump threatened to send “more than the National Guard” to \"troubled\" U.S. cities. At the time, he didn't identify which cities he intended to send troops to.\n\n“We’re sending in our National Guard and if we need more than the National Guard, we’ll send more than the National Guard because we’re going to have safe cities,” Trump said Oct. 28 at a U.S. naval base in Yokosuka, Japan, during his weeklong Asia trip. “We’re not going to have people killed in our cities. Whether people like that or not, that’s what we’re doing.\"\n\nWhile Lyles and other city officials are in opposition to the DHS's operation, Congressman Tim Moore, a Republican who represents a district outside Charlotte, said he has \"full confidence in our federal law enforcement partners and appreciates their ongoing work to uphold the rule of law and protect the people of North Carolina.\"","url":"https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/11/15/dhs-immigration-agents-surging-toward-charlotte/87295256007/","image":"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/15/USAT/87296915007-20251017-t-234555-z-1343128707-rc-2-d-4-haghq-9-s-rtrmadp-3-usaicechicago.JPG?auto=webp&crop=2975,1675,x0,y154&format=pjpg&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-15 23:13:11","author":"Usa Today","authors":["Usa Today"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.097},{"id":379393344,"title":"UK PM Urged to Defend National Interests as Trump Threatens Legal Action Against BBC","text":"Sir Keir Starmer is being urged to take a firm stance for the UK and dissuade Donald Trump from pursuing a massive lawsuit against the BBC.\n\nOn Friday evening, the former US President declared his intention to demand up to $5 billion (£3.8 billion) in compensation, alleging that the broadcaster had misrepresented one of his speeches through selective editing.\n\nWhile the BBC has issued an apology, they have refused to compensate Trump financially, paving the way for a potentially high-profile legal battle.\n\nTrump’s statements have caused significant concern within the BBC, which now confronts the daunting possibility of expending large sums of licence-fee payers’ money to either contest or settle the case.\n\nThe President mentioned plans to contact Sir Keir over the weekend to discuss the situation, noting that the Prime Minister felt ‘very embarrassed’ by the developments.\n\nWith the BBC’s future seemingly at risk, Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey has called on the Prime Minister to leverage his rapport with Trump to persuade him to drop the lawsuit.\n\n‘This is Keir Starmer’s moment to stand up for Britain and call on Trump to drop his ludicrous lawsuit,’ he said. ‘The Prime Minister has spent months cosying up to Trump. If he can’t stop him from attacking one of our most precious institutions, what was it all for?’\n\nMeanwhile, former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has said it is now time for the scandal-hit BBC to appoint an internal watchdog.\n\nMr Trump is expected to launch his lawsuit in Florida. The Panorama film which contained the edit appearing to show him inciting Capitol Hill protesters to violence on January 6, 2021, was not available in the US, but experts believe the case could still come before a jury, which is likely to be sympathetic to the President.\n\nBBC chairman Samir Shah last week sent a personal letter to the White House to apologise for the editing, which has not been enough to satisfy the President.\n\nSpeaking on Air Force One on Friday, Mr Trump said of his legal action: ‘I think I have to do it. They’ve even admitted that they cheated… They changed the words coming out of my mouth.’\n\n‘The people of the UK are very angry about what happened as you can imagine because it shows the BBC is fake news.’\n\nIn a separate interview on GB News on Friday night, Mr Trump claimed he had an ‘obligation’ to sue the BBC, which he branded ‘corrupt’ and ‘beyond fake’. ‘This was so egregious. If you don’t do it, you don’t stop it from happening again with other people. I’d like to find out why they did it.’\n\nSam Nunberg, a former Trump campaign official, today said he believed the President had ‘a pretty solid case’ and that the BBC’s lawyers would probably be unable to persuade a judge to throw the claim out of court and could face a settlement of millions. \n\n‘I think the BBC should be taking this extremely seriously. I think [a settlement] would be high seven figures. It’s a large amount of money.’\n\nIn July, US media giant Paramount agreed to pay Mr Trump $16 million (£13.5 million) to settle a lawsuit over an interview on CBS with former Vice-President Kamala Harris, which he said was edited too sympathetically.\n\nBut speaking to The Mail on Sunday, Lord Patten, a former chairman of the BBC, said: ‘The BBC board should tell Donald Trump they will see him in court. The BBC is part of our democracy, and an important part. \n\n‘I am not in favour of kowtowing to Trump about this absurd charge.’ \n\nSir Craig Oliver, a former BBC executive and director of communications for Prime Minister David Cameron, said the corporation faced a ‘nightmare situation… It does clearly believe that it’s got a strong case but really the problem is that public money could be spent – or is going to be spent – fighting this or settling this.’\n\nFormer Tory Culture Secretary Sir John Whittingdale added: ‘It would be highly undesirable to have the BBC having to defend what was clearly a very serious failing of editorial judgment in an American court. It is not exactly going to help improve our relations with our closest ally.’\n\nWriting in today’s Sunday Times, Mr Sunak said: ‘The BBC has too often misjudged the nation’s mood, mishandled its people and mismanaged its own processes.\n\n‘One of the actions that the BBC should take now is to appoint an internal watchdog responsible for spotting problems and addressing them before they have turned into a scandal. \n\n‘It cannot continue to sit back and wait for others to highlight its mistakes, and then ponder whether to react before comforting itself that any criticism must be driven by base political motives.’\n\nA BBC spokesman said: ‘While the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nSir Keir Starmer is being urged to take a firm stance for&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: UK PM Urged to Defend National Interests as Trump Threatens Legal Action Against BBC first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/uk-pm-urged-to-defend-national-interests-as-trump-threatens-legal-action-against-bbc/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/PM-facing-calls-to-stand-up-for-Britain-after-Trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-15 23:03:26","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.495},{"id":379393754,"title":"Michelle Obama says the U.S. is 'not ready' for a woman president","text":"Former first lady Michelle Obama said in a conversation published to her YouTube page Friday that the country is not ready for a woman president, adding that the U.S. has “a lot of growing up to do.” “As we saw in this past election, sadly, we ain’t ready,” Obama said. “That’s why I’m like, don’t even look at me about running, because you all are lying.
