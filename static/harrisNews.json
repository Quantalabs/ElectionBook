And you had these relationships...\n\n[Audience breaks into laughter]\n\nVANCE: Not very well as it turns out.\n\nKENNEDY (cont'd) ...Al Gore and Bill Clinton and Mondale and Carter who had close personal friendships. You have an amazing job because you have a president who clearly puts tremendous faith in you, he relies on you, he's given you an extraordinary retinue of responsibilities. Talk a little bit about how your relationship with the president has evolved.\n\nVANCE: Yeah, That's a great question...\n\nKENNEDY: It's clear to all of us in the cabinet, how much affection that he has for you, and how much he relies on your wisdom.\n\nVANCE: It's interesting, you're exactly right. The job of the vice president is incredibly contingent on the president that you're serving under. And you can have a president who effectively just passes off big swaths of responsibility. You can have a president who delegates, you can have a president who has no trust in their vice president: Kamala Harris [audience laughs], so, it doesn't go very well for that particular vice president.\n\nBut, I think there are two ways that I try to think of my job with the President of the United States. Number one, he requires honest counsel. In other words, if I have an opinion about something, whether I agree or disagree with the administrative position, it's really, really important that I talk to the president about it. He doesn't want Yes men, and I think that's one of the reasons why you guys have a great relationship because you're always thinking about how can I actually give the president the best counsel.\n\nBut then, the second thing is, when the president makes a decision, it's your job to execute. It's not to run to the papers and say, \"Well, actually, I disagreed with this decision,\" or run to the Congress and badmouth the administration, it's to execute.\n\nAnd I think the reason why the president has trust in me, Is because, yes, I absolutely tell the president what I think about a given issue. But I also recognize, I'm the vice president, he's the president, and when the President of the United States makes the decision, it's time to go and get it done. In part because I get things done. Right? Sometimes Congress doesn't cooperate, sometimes the private sector doesn't cooperate, Like, I'm not saying any of us have a batting average of 1000. \n\nBut what I think all of us who have earned the president's trust do, is that when the administration makes a decision, when he makes a decision, we actually go out and get it done. And that's why this job has been so empowering for me is that the president trusts me, he knows I'm going to give him honest counsel, he knows that if he asks me to get something done, I'm going to try my best to actually go and do it. And that's why whe have a good partnership, I think that's why the administration has been so effective this time around, is because there's a lot of people with a very wide diversity of opinions, but we get out there and we try to do the best job for the American people and the President of the United States. And because of that, there's a lot of trust and a lot of affection in the cabinet.\n\nI mean, you've seen this, I've seen this. But when we're sitting in there, and the cameras are off, and we're just talking about an issue, there is a deep level of affection and trust between all the senior members of the team. I don't know how it's possible to do this job without it, but I know it's why we've been so successful in the past 10 months.","url":"https://redstate.com/jenniferoo/2025/11/12/vp-jd-vance-speaks-at-the-first-ever-maha-summit-n2196122","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2025/316/ae8a26d0-0e63-441f-bd75-7c2c5fb4a3ef.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-13 00:31:17","author":"Jennifer Oliver O'connell","authors":["Jennifer Oliver O'connell"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.238},{"id":378408692,"title":"The Epstein email receipts show sex offender’s deep reach in Washington went far beyond Trump","text":"The former prince, Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, fell into disgrace after it was revealed that he kept in contact with Jeffrey Epstein after the financier was convicted of sex crimes in 2008 in a “sweetheart deal” that largely allowed him to escape judgment for his crimes.\n\nBut were Washington’s elite held to those same standards, there would be plenty of disgrace to go around.\n\nOn Wednesday, another trove of email chains involving Jeffrey Epstein and his former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, was released by the House Oversight Committee’s members, which include both Republicans and Democrats.

Mangual: It confirms “what bail-reform critics have been saying all along” — that “it was a bad idea” to “restrict bail while prohibiting judges from detaining dangerous pretrial defendants based on public safety risk.” Notably, when it comes to “high-risk” defendants, the “reduced use of bail” is linked to worse outcomes, including “higher arrest rates in general and for violent felonies in particular.” The findings “point in the same direction” as the researchers’ earlier analyses. But: “Will the politicians in Albany considering changes to bail policy be guided by evidence — or ideology?”\n\nLiberal: Trump Family’s Bitcoin Reek\n\nCryptocurrency “has been spectacularly good for the Trumps,” reports The Free Press’ Joe Nocera, but oy, the ethical cloud! “Were [Donald] Trump not president, it is hard to imagine that there would have been much demand for any of Trump’s tokens,” but “meme coin sales generated $320 million in fees for the Trumps, as well as untold millions in the meme coins that the Trumps still hold.” Worse, in at least three cases, “people who helped enrich Trump and his family through the use of cryptocurrencies were looking for something from the administration” — and soon “got what they wanted.” One crypto billionaire who’d fled the country in 2023 after the Securities and Exchange Commission charged him “with manipulating the cryptocurrency market,” saw the SEC pause its case against him — seemingly indefinitely. Another crypto billionaire won a presidential pardon after a terrorism-linked money-laundering conviction. And the UAE won an OK to buy “advanced semiconductor chips—despite fears among national security experts that the UAE would give access to the chips to China.”\n\nConservative: Josh Shapiro’s Tough Choice\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, was “the obvious choice on paper” to be Kamala Harris’s veep choice last year, notes Commentary’s Seth Mandel, but his “visible and proud Jewishness” made him an “untenable option” for the party’s base after “Gaza became the litmus test for progressive political activist groups.” He’s a “swing-state moderate” who wins elections, but the “progressive base would rather lose than win with him.” He could win “a place in the party elite in return for a public apology for his Jewishness,” or at least if he learns “to keep mum unless he has an anti-Zionist-ish thing to say.” Will Shapiro “resist this quiet capitulation”?\n\nFrom the right: ‘Choose Country Over Party’\n\nSen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) “hasn’t just talked about opposing the shutdown — he has acted,” cheers the Washington Examiner’s Salena Zito, casting “15 votes in favor of reopening the government” while fellow Dems “voted against 15 times.” He calls his party’s shutdown strategy a “failure” because the deal now “agreed to is the exact same one that was on the table 40 days ago.” “Some Pennsylvania Democrats were already plotting to challenge him in a 2028 primary,” but “Fetterman has never been a favorite of his party’s establishment”: He wins because “voters have consistently stood by him.”\n\nCampus watch: Rise of a Pro-Speech University\n\n“Too many campuses seem committed to teaching their students what to think — not how to think,” but “a start-up university in Texas is showing that there is another path forward,” and it’s attracting attention, applauds USA Today’s Ingrid Jacques. Co-founded by The Free Press’ Bari Weiss, the University of Austin doesn’t “charge students tuition and does not accept government funding, relying instead on private donations.” And it just got a big one: Billionaire Jeff Yass “is donating $100 million.” “The same independence, curiosity and diversity of views” Weiss “brought to the news media are echoed” at UATX. While “the country’s historically esteemed colleges have some of the worst rankings for free speech,” “UATX wants the opposite for its students, who should not expect to be coddled.” \n\n— Compiled by The Post Editorial Board","summary":"A new analysis of New York’s bail reforms from John Jay College’s Data Collaborative for Justice does the opposite of what the researches claim, explains City Journal’s Rafael A.

Kennedy, announced he will run for Congress next year.In a social media post late Tuesday, Schlossberg said he would be seeking the Democratic nomination to replace longtime Rep. Jerry Nadler in New York’s 12th Congressional District. Nadler, a leading liberal figure for the Democratic Party in Congress, said in September that he would not seek reelection. ...Schlossberg is the son of Caroline Kennedy and Edwin Schlossberg, and the nephew of the late John F. Kennedy Jr. He worked as a political correspondent for Vogue during the 2024 election, and he became a New York delegate to the Democratic National Convention after Kamala Harris replaced then-president Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee.However, he is particularly well known as a social media personality with more than 1.5 million followers across TikTok and Instagram. He posts clips of himself singing the Beatles without a shirt on, reciting Lord Byron while riding a RipStik skateboard, or making political commentary.\n\nThe most amusing irony about this is the rejection of Robert Kennedy Jr by Democrats, both in the presidential primary when challenging a senile Joe Biden, and then even more vociferously after RFK Jr endorsed and campaigned for Trump. Schlossberg himself was particularly vocal in shunning his cousin. Some Kennedys are more equal than others, apparently.\n\nAt least the latest remake of Dynasty: Camelot stars an actual Kennedy this time. A few years ago, Robert Francis O'Rourke got the Kennedy treatment when he challenged Ted Cruz for the Senate in 2018, and then tossed his hat in the ring for the 2020 presidential primaries. O'Rourke flopped out of that contest (as did Kamala Harris), and then went on to get shellacked by Greg Abbott in the 2022 Texas gubernatorial election. Supposedly, O'Rourke plans another run at the Senate next year, but Beto won't get the Annie Leibovitz treatment this time around.\n\nIronically. O'Rourke would have to go through the Democrats' latest pretender to a throne in Texas.

For those of you without a calendar in front of you, that would have made the subsidies sunset on the eve of the midterm elections. That's not a coincidence. Democrats absolutely planned to use the subsidies as an election issue. If these subsidies are necessary, and the only thing staving off a \"healthcare crisis\" — as the Democrats keep telling me — why would they have a sunset date at all?\n\nFor political gain. That's why. \n\nFor now, Republicans seem to have denied them that leverage, and it should stay that way.\n\nBut I digress.\n\nAs I said, Obamacare is working precisely how Democrats wanted it to, and on two fronts. First, the political wedge issue, and second, as the vehicle by which they'll run us over with socialized medicine.\n\nAvik Roy said, \"[Obamacare] overcharged healthy people that needed insurance to help fund the cost of insurance for sick people, and overcharged young people... The end result is, if only sicker and older people buy insurance, the price of insurance for everybody goes through the roof.\"\n\nThat is accurate. But that was also intentional. Despite the fact that Nancy Pelosi said we had to pass the bill to find out what's in it, the framers of the legislation knew exactly what they were doing.\n\nKamala Harris, who was a few million votes away from the Oval Office, said she would abolish private health insurance in favor of a single-payer system. She's not alone. Other prominent Democrats, including Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Bill de Blasio, are on record as advocating for the elimination of private insurance.\n\nIf you want a taste of what government-run healthcare would be like, we've already got it thanks to Obamacare. Increased wait times, exploding costs (because nothing is more expensive than when it's \"free\"), and bureaucratic control of healthcare decisions that should be between a patient and her doctor. I guess that last provision only applies when the woman wants to kill her unborn child. But it would be much more insidious than that in the era of woke.\n\nYesterday, I wrote about Do No Harm winning a suit to undo a Biden-era rule that rewarded doctors who implemented \"anti-racist\" plans for their practices. During my interview with Dr. Goldfarb, we touched briefly on woke changes to things like the kidney transplant list, where racial differences were removed despite the fact that Blacks and Whites have different kidney function. The long story short: these \"anti-racist\" changes definitely cost White people spots on the transplant list, and probably led to deaths.\n\nNow imagine that policy across the entirety of healthcare. My aunt, who is also White, fell over the weekend and broke her hip. Thankfully, she had surgery on Monday and is on the road to recovery. But what happens in a world of socialized medicine where \"anti-racist\" policies rule the day? Would she have gotten surgery in a timely manner? Would she have gotten surgery at all? She's older, after all, and retired.\n\nRepublicans need to reframe the debate on Obamacare. It's not broken. It didn't \"go wrong.\" It was designed to make private insurance unaffordable. It was meant to create the exact \"healthcare crisis\" we're experiencing now, so that Democrats could swoop in and promise \"free\" healthcare via socialized medicine.\n\nThat's the message we need to take to voters, and a Republican Congress needs to put forth a bill to repeal Obamacare in full and return free market principles to health insurance. The alternative is costly, both in cash and in lives.","url":"https://townhall.com/tipsheet/amy-curtis/2025/11/12/obamacare-didnt-fail-its-working-exactly-as-intended-n2666313","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2019/87/8d109acc-8ff2-44bd-85aa-74e96c62902a.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-12 23:30:16","author":"Amy Curtis","authors":["Amy Curtis"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.675},{"id":378383004,"title":"Sherrod Brown Chances of Beating Jon Husted to Flip Ohio for Democrats—Poll","text":"Former Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown has improved his chances of winning a Senate seat in Ohio after his 2024 loss, according to a new poll released Tuesday.\n\nNewsweek has reached out to Brown and Husted’s campaigns for comment via email on Wednesday.\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nBrown, who was in office for 18 years, lost last year’s Senate race to Republican Bernie Moreno. Historically, the party in the White House loses seats in the midterms, but Ohio has grown increasingly conservative over the past decade. The state backed President Donald Trump by double digits in November, which also saw its former senator, JD Vance, to the vice presidency.\n\nDemocrats notched wins in gubernatorial races, mayoral contests and a key ballot measure on Tuesday, but redistricting fights, an upcoming Supreme Court ruling and a tougher 2026 U.S. Senate map could temper that momentum heading into the midterms.\n\nDemocrats will need to win double-digit Trump seats to win control of the Senate, where Republicans hold a 53-47 majority. Democrats view Maine, which voted for Vice President Kamala Harris by about 7 points, and North Carolina, which voted for Trump by about 3 points, as flip opportunities. But no other GOP-held seats in Harris-won or single-digit Trump states are up for grabs, meaning Democrats have to target more conservative states like Alaska, Iowa, Ohio and Texas.\n\nDemocratic Ohio Sen.

Bickel, File)\n\nWhat To Know\n\nBrown, who served in the Senate from 2007 to 2025, announced his 2026 Senate run in August. He is running against Husted who was appointed by Ohio Governor Mike DeWine to fill Vance’s seat in January.\n\nSenate doesn’t elect every member each cycle because senators serve six-year terms. In November 2026, 33 seats will be contested, 20 of which are currently held by Republicans and 13 by Democrats.\n\nA Hart Research poll conducted on behalf of the Ohio Federation of Teachers surveyed 800 likely Ohio voters and found a boost in Brown’s chances of flipping Husted’s seat.\n\nThe survey, released Tuesday and conducted between September 19 and 22, found that likely voters overall prefer Brown, 48 percent, to Husted, 45 percent. It was conducted ahead of the government shutdown and the 2025 elections.\n\nBrown led independent voters by 25 percentage points, with 56 percent backing him and 31 percent supporting Husted. Both candidates polled well among their own parties, while Brown also performed better among women, 54 percent to 40 percent.\n\nThe poll also found that Brown is viewed more favorably overall, with a 42 percent favorability rating, while Husted is viewed favorably by only 21 percent. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.\n\nU.S. Sen. Jon Husted, candidate for Senate in 2026, speaks in Columbus, Monday, Sept. 22, 2025. (AP Photo/Sue Ogrocki)\n\nAnother poll has found Brown slightly ahead. Conducted by Bowling Green State University, the survey showed Brown with 49 percent and Husted with 48. It surveyed 800 registered voters from October 2-14 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points.\n\nAn earlier Emerson College poll of 1,000 registered Ohio voters conducted between August 18-19, found Husted ahead of Brown, 50 percent to 44 percent. The poll also found Brown’s favorability rating higher than Husted’s, 44 percent to the incumbent’s 33 percent. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.\n\nWhat People Are Saying \n\nSherrod Brown said in an X post on November 9: “Half a million Ohioans are facing monthly premiums that are double or triple what they were paying. This is a bad deal for Ohioans. It does nothing to help the out-of-control costs people are facing. We can’t allow health care costs to skyrocket and not be willing to fight. This is a problem created by Jon Husted and his special interest friends. At any point over the last 40 days, Jon Husted could have voted to reopen the government and helped people afford health care. But Jon Husted has done nothing to keep health care costs down.”\n\nSenator Jon Husted said in a November 9 X post: “After 40 days of needless suffering for the American people, enough reasonable Democrats did the right thing and voted with us to end the Schumer Shutdown. We now have a path forward to put a stop to the damage of the shutdown and get back to work. I voted for the 15th time to reopen the government and to give hardworking Americans the pay and benefits they depend on. Ohioans can always count on me to be part of the solution.”\n\nOhio Federation of Teachers said in a November 12 X post sharing the poll: “OFT Poll: @SherrodBrown is leading Senator Jon Husted by 3 points.

Gavin Newsom’s Former Chief Of Staff","text":"California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom’s former chief of staff Dana Williamson was arrested Wednesday and charged with conspiracy to commit bank and wire fraud, among other crimes, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of California.\n\nIn a press statement, the office announced that a 23-count indictment was unsealed Wednesday morning following Williamson’s arrest. A federal grand jury charged her with filing false tax returns, making false statements and participating in conspiracies to commit bank and wire fraud, defraud the United States and obstruct justice.\n\nU.S. Attorney Eric Grant, who announced the arrest, called the charges a “crucial step” in a three-year political corruption investigation. (RELATED: White House Rips Newsom A New One After ‘Disrespect’ Comment At Climate Confab)\n\n“As it always has, the U.S. Attorney’s Office will continue to work tirelessly with our law enforcement partners to protect the people of California from political corruption,” Grant said.\n\nBetween February 2022 and September 2024, Williamson allegedly conspired with others to divert about $225,000 from a dormant political campaign to an associate’s personal use, according to court documents. Prosecutors claim Williamson and her associates funneled the money through multiple business entities, disguising it as payment for “what was, in reality, a no-show job.”\n\nWilliamson served as Newsom‘s chief of staff from 2022 to 2024, leaving in December after the governor appointed Nathan Barankin to the role. Reports at the time noted that Newsom chose Barankin for his White House experience under former Vice President Kamala Harris, amid speculation about Newsom’s political ambitions.\n\nIn a statement provided to the Daily Caller News Foundation, a spokesperson for the governor stated Williamson “no longer serves in this administration.”\n\n“While we are still learning details of the allegations, the Governor expects all public servants to uphold the highest standards of integrity,” the spokesperson stated. “At a time when the President is openly calling for his Attorney General to investigate his political enemies, it is especially important to honor the American principle of being innocent until proven guilty in a court of law by a jury of one’s peers.”\n\nOfficials also allege the 53-year-old political consultant worked with a business associate to create false, backdated contracts after she was subpoenaed in January 2024 by the U.S. Attorney’s Office over Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans tied to her business.\n\nAdditionally, Williamson is accused of filing false tax returns, claiming more than $1 million in business deductions for “what were actually personal and nondeductible expenditures,” including luxury hotel stays, home furnishings and private jet travel, according to prosecutors.\n\nWilliamson is expected to make her first appearance in court Wednesday at 2 p.m. local time.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Schlossberg, a Democrat, said his campaign is motivated by the need to address what he called a “cost of living crisis” caused by Republican and Trump administration policies, including Donald Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill.” He said these policies had led to deep cuts in essential services such as health care, education, and child care, hurting working families, as per ABC News report. What Schlossberg Said In his announcement video posted on Instagram, Schlossberg said, “We deserve better, and we can do better, and it starts with the Democratic Party winning back control of the House of Representatives.” He said that control of Congress would give Democrats the power to enact meaningful change, warning that without it, “we’re helpless to a third term.” Schlossberg, whose full name is John Bouvier Kennedy Schlossberg, is a graduate of Yale University and Harvard Law School.

John Fetterman (D-PA) doesn't seem shy about saying exactly what he thinks.\n\nHe showed that again with the government shutdown, which he chastised his party for causing. He was a \"yes\" vote to open the government to begin with. \n\nThat earned him a lot of ire from the left. During an interview on CNN with Dana Bash for his book, \"Unfettered,\" Fetterman explained that the \"most poisonous, the bitterest\" venom he had experienced was from the far left. \n\nFetterman said the worst was from Bluesky, the leftist social media haven. \n\n And the difference is, I mean, the right would say really rough things and names.

Or that's terrible, that depression. Why couldn't the depression have won? And I hope your kids find you.\n\nHe said they even had a stroke gif, and said the doctor \"let us down...why did they have to save his life?\" That shocked even Bash, who was shaking her head at how evil the attacks were. Fetterman said he didn't know where such thinking comes from, but he's made it clear that it wasn't going to stop him from saying what he thinks. \n\nREAD MORE: Sen.

Josh Shapiro and their relationship has \"never recovered.\" They were on the Board of Pardons together, and they disagreed in a Zoom meeting about commuting sentences. Then Fetterman called him a “f—ing a—hole” into a hot mic. He was so ticked off at him, he threatened to run against him for governor in 2022. \n\n“I told him there were two tracks — that one and the one in which he ran for governor and I ran for the Senate (which was the one I preferred),“ Fetterman writes in his new book, “Unfettered,” as excerpted by the Philadelphia Inquirer”I had no interest in friction, only in what I felt was justice.”\n\nHe said he thought Shapiro was driven by \"political ambition.\" \n\nAlthough their relationship had never recovered, he said he wished Shapiro well. But that didn't stop him from dishing to Kamala Harris about his concerns about Shapiro. \n\nDuring the 2024 campaign, Fetterman privately confided his apprehension about Shapiro to former Vice President Kamala Harris’ team as they considered potential running mates, Politico reported at the time.\n\nThat might be one of the reasons she didn't pick him, and it gives the questions about Shapiro more credence if Fetterman is also saying it. \n\nThat may have helped to defeat her. She instead picked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate. And then, as we all know, she went on to lose Pennsylvania - and the race for the presidency. \n\nEditor’s Note: The Schumer Shutdown is here.

John Fetterman, D-Pa., believed helped Democrats lose big last year. In his memoir \"Unfettered,\" Fetterman unloaded on the Democratic Party and his colleagues' missteps that he argued led to President Donald Trump's victory over former Vice President Kamala Harris, and a sea change in Washington, D.C. Fetterman argued that the Democratic Party had lost touch with the working class, a key bloc of voters that at one point made up the backbone of the party. DEMOCRATS, LEFT EMPTY-HANDED IN SHUTDOWN, TURN FURY ON SCHUMER In particular, it was the attacks on men, be it through speeches or legislation, that helped turn the Democratic Party into an elitist organization too focused on \"celebrity endorsements,\" he said. In turn, those who voted for Trump perceived \"Democrats as soft and gooey, with a platform built on ideals that weren’t based in the reality of the average person.\" \"We became the party of the elites, one that had lost touch with its base,\" he wrote. \"Also, the continued speech and policies against men have not been without consequences.\" \"If men are forced to choose between picking their party or keeping their balls, most men are going to choose their balls,\" Fetterman continued. Fetterman’s book, released on Tuesday, comes at a particular inflection point for Democrats. The party had spent much of the year searching for a binding message to both rebuild their brand with voters and build unity among their ranks in Congress. SENATE ENDS 41-DAY GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN STALEMATE, SENDS BIPARTISAN DEAL TO HOUSE That came with the government shutdown, where Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and the majority of the caucus moved in lockstep with demands that the government wouldn't reopen until expiring Obamacare subsidies were dealt with. Schumer’s failure to prevent a cohort of Senate Democrats, including Fetterman, from crossing the aisle to join Republicans has earned him heat from progressives in the House and outside the walls of Congress. Despite often straying from Schumer’s position, particularly throughout the shutdown, Fetterman wrote sparingly of the top Senate Democrat. Instead, he is briefly mentioned when reflecting on Schumer’s 2023 decision to change the dress code on the Senate floor to accommodate Fetterman, whose standard dress is a baggy hoodie and basketball shorts. But Schumer caved on that initiative, too, in early 2024. MIKE JOHNSON EYES WEDNESDAY VOTE WITH END OF GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN IN SIGHT \"Schumer was forced to reverse himself and enforce a dress code aimed at me,\" Fetterman wrote. One policy area in particular that Fetterman felt Democrats had failed was immigration. He reiterated that while he was pro-immigration, Democrats’ unwillingness to tackle the growing crisis at the southern border under former President Joe Biden was something he couldn’t get behind. He wrote that Democrats’ assertion that \"an open border is a compassionate policy,\" wasn’t based in reality. \"It is chaos, both for those immigrants and for the citizens impacted by the overwhelming number of people coming in who need assistance,\" he wrote. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP And further, that position likely played a large factor in Trump and the GOP’s across-the-board victories in 2024, Fetterman argued. \"Democrats were swearing up and down that the border was secure and telling its voters to not believe their own eyes,\" he wrote. \"I suspect this may have been the deciding factor in the 2024 election. You can’t tell people to not believe their own eyes and expect to win elections.\"","summary":"In his new memoir, Sen.

Without it, we’re helpless to a third term,” Mr Schlossberg, who is running for a seat already held by the Democrats, said in the video.\n\nIf elected, running New York’s 12th Congressional district would mark the first full-time job Mr Schlossberg has held since graduating from Harvard Law in 2022.\n\nA self-styled “writer, advocate and lifelong Democrat”, the Harvard and Yale graduate was appointed Vogue’s political correspondent in July 2024 but wrote just five articles, according to Muck Rack.\n\nHe was hired in part thanks to what the magazine called his “silly goose” antics online, such as videos asking whether the second lady is “hotter” than his late grandmother, Jackie Kennedy Onassis.\n\n“This one goes out to Usha Vance, the most beautiful woman in the world. Whenever you’re ready, I’m here for you,” he said on TikTok.\n\nThe video followed a post on X, where he asked: “True or false? Usha Vance is way hotter than Jackie O,” drawing a backlash from people who labelled his comments “creepy” and inappropriate.\n\nIn a recent video, he blamed the Republicans for the government shutdown and called on Democrats to “fight fire with fire”, before stamping the ground and impersonating a bull.\n\nIn August, he posed in a blonde wig to mock Mrs Trump over her letter to Vladimir Putin, in which she called on the Russian despot to release Ukrainian children separated from their families.\n\n“What am I saying, this make no sense,” he signed off, speaking in a thick Eastern European accent.\n\nThe millennial candidate spent his first day on the campaign bashing his “rabid dog” cousin whom he accused of “spreading misinformation” about public health.\n\n“RFK Jr is a dangerous person who is making life-and-death decisions as secretary of Health and Human Services,” he told MSNBC.\n\nHe went on to claim that the president had “put a collar” on his 71-year-old cousin and “has him there barking, spreading lies and spreading misinformation”.\n\nLast month, the Kennedy scion posted an image of a Halloween costume for “MAHA Man,” in reference to Kennedy’s Make America Healthy Again message.\n\nHe said its features included measles, ending cancer research and sexual assault – an apparent reference to allegations levelled against Mr Kennedy by a former babysitter, who claimed she was groped by the health secretary in 1998.\n\nMr Kennedy is widely reported to have texted an apology to the accuser, saying he had no memory of the incident, but he has never commented publicly on the claims.\n\nMr Schlossberg’s bid is likely to draw comparisons to that of Zohran Mamdani, another millennial who was elected last Tuesday as mayor of New York City, having experienced a meteoric rise thanks in part to his social media-friendly campaign.\n\nCaroline Kennedy, Mr Schlossberg’s mother, is said to have pleaded with her son not to run because it could make him a “target for violent haters”, a source close to the family told The New York Post.\n\nThe insider said that Mrs Kennedy was “living in fear” because she believes “the political world has become too dangerous, too frightening, too crazy”, the source said.\n\nMr Schlossberg faces competition from several other Democratic primary contenders, including New York State Assembly member Micah Lasher, who previously worked as an aide for Mr Nadler.\n\nMr Nadler, 78, said in September that he was retiring next year after more than 30 years in the House, acknowledging a widespread clamour within the party to make way for a younger generation of leaders.\n\nThe only grandson of the late president, who was assassinated in 1963, Mr Schlossberg has previously said he was “inspired” by Barack Obama and gave a speech at the 2024 Democratic National Convention in which he endorsed Kamala Harris.","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/jfk-influencer-grandson-run-congress-192828621.html","image":"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/WzGqHcghFdWLjUej3tfo0w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTIzNDg7aD0xNDY4O2NmPXdlYnA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_telegraph_818/873649e143a85419f1afd6edb1572b00","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-12 19:28:28","author":"Cameron Henderson","authors":["Cameron Henderson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.009},{"id":378357942,"title":"Lawmakers say Paramount Skydance 'stonewalling' probe into Trump merger approval -

'I think the polls are fake.'\n\nTrump's comments echoed those of Democratic President Joe Biden, who downplayed frustration over inflation by pointing to other economic progress his administration had made, trying to pull the country out of the COVID-19 pandemic. \n\nBiden was able to be portrayed as out of touch, and the Democrats' eventual 2024 nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, didn't do enough to distance herself from Biden's record. \n\nCut to 2025, and polls show Americans still are feeling sour about the economy and have mixed feelings about some of Trump's policies - including tariffs - that the president believes will improve it.\n\n'You can't convince people that their experience, what they're feeling at home, isn't reality,' a Trump adviser told CNN, acknowledging the problem. \n\nA senior White House official told the network that 'the president gets it.' \n\n'But he's frustrated he's not getting credit for what he's doing,' the official said, pointing to the Big Beautiful Bill's extension of the 2017 tax cuts and energy deregulation. \n\nIf Republicans aren't able to adequately message on the economy, it imperils the entire MAGA agenda.\n\nIf Democrats win a majority in the House of Representatives during next year's midterms, Trump becomes a lame duck. \n\nRepublicans that the Daily Mail interviewed last week suggested that Trump and GOP candidates needed to point to the progress that's been made, but say they're not done yet. \n\n'The Biden problem was this: they were trying to tell us, \"don't believe your lying eyes.\" Prices were up during the Biden administration, and they were like, \"Oh, it's no big deal,\"' former White House press secretary Sean Spicer told the Daily Mail. \n\nHe offered a simple analogy: something that cost $3 rose to $5 under Biden, and is now back to $4 under Trump.\n\n'Where Trump needs to step it up is to say \"Hey guys, it went from $5 to $4, I want to get it to $3, we're not there yet, and we're going to keep fighting for it,\"' Spicer advised.","summary":"White House aides are trying to make up for President Donald Trump calling Americans' economic frustrations 'fake' by sending him out on tour.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15283959/white-house-panic-trump-economy.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/11/12/16/103823671-0-image-m-97_1762966689214.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-12 19:20:09","author":"Editor,Nikki Schwab","authors":["Editor","Nikki Schwab"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.243},{"id":378370322,"title":"Democrats Should Be Panicking About New York Right Now","text":"Democrats should be breaking out in a cold sweat right about now. A new poll from J.L. Partners shows Rep. Elise Stefanik trailing Gov. Kathy Hochul by a razor-thin three points in next year's gubernatorial race, with Hochul at 46% and Stefanik at 43%. That margin falls comfortably within the poll's 4.4% margin of error, making this a statistical dead heat.\n\nThe survey, conducted November 9 and 10 among 500 likely voters and weighted for gender, age, ethnicity, and region, should send alarm bells ringing through Democratic circles in Albany and, frankly, Washington, DC.\n\nThis represents a stunning collapse for Hochul. Just a few months ago, a September Siena poll had her up by 25 points over Stefanik, leading 52% to 27%. Before that, an August Siena poll showed a 14-point lead at 45% to 31%, down from a 23-point advantage in June when she led 47% to 24%. The trend line tells a brutal story for the incumbent, and it shows no signs of reversing—especially in the wake of Zohran Mamdani’s victory in the New York City mayoral election.\n\nEven more troubling for Democrats, only 37% of voters say they would vote to reelect Hochul or even consider it, while a decisive 55% say it's time for someone new. Hochul faces mounting criticism over soaring costs, persistent population outmigration, and controversial criminal justice policies, including cashless bail and parole reforms that have become deeply unpopular with voters.\n\nNaturally, Stefanik has zeroed in on these vulnerabilities, making public safety and affordability the centerpiece of her campaign message, and aligning herself with President Donald Trump's push to crack down on cashless bail.\n\nWhen Stefanik formally launched her gubernatorial bid, she called Hochul the worst governor in America and pledged to make New York affordable and safe for all.\n\nICYMI: Ted Cruz Makes Huge Move Against Rogue Anti-Trump Judges\n\nStefanik isn’t the only Republican in the race, but it’s really no contest there. Stefanik dominates with 74% support among likely GOP voters, while Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman registers just 5%. The primary poll surveyed 400 likely Republican primary voters and carries a 4.9% margin of error. More than three-quarters of Republican voters view Stefanik favorably, while over 75% either don't know or have no opinion of Blakeman. J.L. Partners co-founder James Johnson summed it up bluntly, saying Stefanik seems to dominate the Republican vote and that it's a done deal.\n\nWhen the poll tested Blakeman instead of Stefanik against Hochul, the governor's lead widened to 47% to 36%, demonstrating that Stefanik is clearly the Republicans' strongest chance to unseat Hochul.\n\nThe pollster's credibility is worth noting here. J.L. Partners correctly projected Trump's popular vote and Electoral College victory over Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024, earning recognition as one of the most accurate forecasters of that election. The firm now rates the 2026 governor's race as essentially a coin flip.\n\nJohnson acknowledged that strong Democrat turnout could still save Hochul but said shifting voter trends suggest growing GOP momentum. Republicans have gained thousands of new voters as Democrats lost more than 108,000 over the past year, according to state data.\n\nNew York Democrats built their empire on the assumption that the state would stay blue forever. That assumption is crumbling before their eyes. Hochul’s freefall from a 25-point lead to a statistical tie in just months doesn’t happen by accident—it happens when voters decide they’ve had enough. Republicans now have the candidate, the message, and the momentum to flip the governor’s mansion.\n\nAnd Democrats have to be worried.\n\nEditor’s Note: After more than 40 days of screwing Americans, a few Dems have finally caved.

Chuck Schumer was forced to fold his hand in what has widely been described as a colossal strategic failure — with one exception. The shutdown ensured that the margins favoring Demos in Virginia were not eroded by controversy — tens of thousands of government workers in Virginia’s DC suburbs were without paychecks, and they vote Democrat. (But there are good reasons for optimism in 2026!)\n\nOf course, the Demo progressives are furious that some of their Senate kin voted to kill their filibuster. 2028 presidential hopeful Gavin Newsom (D-CA) summed up their collective displeasure with one word: “Pathetic.”\n\nHowever, The Wall Street Journal’s James Freeman, in “Democrats Irate Over Loss of Leverage,” posits, “Shouldn’t they pretend to be relieved that people will receive food stamps?” Bottom line: The Demo shutdown resulted in 1.4 million government employees on 41 days of leave with backpay assurance at a cost to taxpayers of more than $16 billion — and billions more in private-sector economic losses.\n\nThis chapter in the Demo clown show may be over, but as National Review’s Rich Lowry notes, “The government shutdown may have been pointless and dumb, but there is much more where that came from.”\n\nSo again, what’s next?\n\nDemocrat Party “progressives,” the current crazy cadre of Marxists hiding behind the more palatable socialist façade, are going to pivot back to the hate and division rhetorical model perfected by the Biden/Harris regime.\n\nThat is their go-to playbook to install fear in their legions of constituents suffering chronic Trump Derangement Syndrome.\n\nJust in time for our upcoming faithful observances of Thanksgiving and Christmas, you can expect some Demo hate rhetoric about “Christian Nationalists” to resurface. Leftists invoke that imaginary bogeyman as a derogatory label for faithful Christians who exercise their First Amendment rights, both faith and free speech, to shape culture and politics.\n\nIt’s just another way to label Trump’s MAGA base supporters as “Bitter, Deplorable, Racist, Misogynist, Fascist, Garbage.”\n\nOf course, the Demos are joined by the “High Church of Woke,” the collapsing Episcopal sect, which is leading the charge against the “urgent danger of Christian nationalism.”\n\nTo be clear, Christians who exercise their First Amendment rights to shape culture and politics are being labeled “Christian Nationalists” — count me in.\n\nFive years ago, as Joe Biden and Kamala Harris were warming up their hate rhetoric, I wrote a column, “The Left’s Next Target: ‘Christian Nationalists’.” I could see it on the horizon but did not see how effective the Demos would be at propagating this BIG Lie.\n\nThere is a reason that leftists are now focused on the question that poses the greatest threat to their power: Who endows the Rights of Man — God (as ordained in natural law), or government (as ordained by man)?\n\nOur nation is founded on the eternal core principle that the “unalienable rights of man” and American Liberty are “endowed by [our] Creator,” as affirmed in our Declaration of Independence and codified in our Constitution.\n\nAnd that irrevocable fact is the greatest threat to the unmitigated acquisition of statist power that the rising Demo socialists seek.\n\nOur Republic is governed by the higher authority of Rule of Law, while democracies are governed by the rule of men. And that is precisely why a significant part of the Demos’ rhetoric over the last five years has been centered on the “threat to democracy” posed by Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans.\n\nRecall when Biden was campaigning ahead of the 2020 election and attempted to quote the Declaration to his dullard constituents: “We hold these truths to be self-evident. All men and women created by the — g'oh — you know the — you know the thing.”\n\n“You know the — you know the thing.”\n\nHe just couldn’t get it out without choking on his words. He couldn’t say “that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.”\n\nRecall some eight weeks ago, when Demo Sen. Tim Kaine dared to say out loud what is core to his party’s claim to power: “The notion that rights don’t come from laws and don’t come from the government but come from the Creator — that’s what the Iranian government believes. It’s a theocratic regime that bases its rule on Shia law and targets Sunnis, Bahá'ís, Jews, Christians, and other religious minorities. And they do it because they believe that they understand what natural rights are from their Creator. So the statement that our rights do not come from our laws or our governments is extremely troubling.”\n\nHe is embarrassingly wrong about rights “endowed by [our] Creator” being a tenet of a “theocratic regime,” and his lack of understanding, his assertion that this founding tenet is “extremely troubling” is anathema to his oath “to support and defend” our Constitution.\n\nPerhaps he should pick up a copy of The Federalist Papers. Note that one of its three authors, Alexander Hamilton, declared: “The sacred rights of mankind are not to be rummaged for among old parchments or musty records. They are written, as with a sunbeam, in the whole volume of human nature, by the hand of the Divinity itself, and can never be erased or obscured by mortal power.”\n\nThat is completely antithetical to statism embraced by the current generation of socialist/communist neophytes.\n\nRecall the essential question posed by Whittaker Chambers in Witness, his famous 1952 treatise on his rejection of communism:\n\nThe Communist Party is quite justified in calling itself the most revolutionary party in history. It has posed in practical form the most revolutionary question in history: God or Man? It is taking the logical next step which 300 years of rationalism hesitated to take, and said what millions of modern minds think, but do not dare or care to say: If man’s mind is the decisive force in the world, what need is there for God? Henceforth man’s mind is man’s fate.\n\nAnd this question about the origin of rights being “God or Man” is the defining question between Right and Left, Liberty and Tyranny.\n\nAs I noted plainly in “Collapse of the Soviet Reign of Tyranny and Terror,” on the hundredth anniversary of the October 1917 communist revolution, there is no consequential distinction between Marxist Socialism, National Socialism, or the most recent incarnation of this beast, Democratic Socialism, in America. Indeed, Democratic Socialism, like National Socialism, is nothing more than Marxist Socialism repackaged. As noted above, behind the façades, there is little ideological distinction. They are all fascists under different labels.\n\nI recently came across this succinct assessment of Democrat socialism in America: “Socialism is resentment disguised as compassion enforced by tyranny disguised as tolerance.”\n\nIgnorance of the true and eternal source of the Rights of Man is fertile ground for the Left’s false assertion that only the state endows such Rights. It is also perilous ground, soaked with the blood of generations of American Patriots who have defended our unalienable right to Life and Liberty.\n\nIn 1781, Thomas Jefferson, the principal author of our Declaration of Independence, asked: “And can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of the people that these liberties are the gift of God? That they are not to be violated but with his wrath? Indeed I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just: that his justice cannot sleep for ever.”\n\nThe simple answer is: No. American Liberty is not secure in the hands of those who reject the notion “that these liberties are the gift of God.”\n\nIn 1787, the year our Founders signed our Constitution, Jefferson declared, “The tree of Liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants.”\n\nThe official motto of the United States Army, as adopted the decade before the signing of our Constitution, is: “This We’ll Defend.” And we must stand ready to defend the eternal truth that our “liberties are the gift of God.”\n\nP.S.

The former “Curb Your Enthusiasm” actress initially seemed to be a reluctant MAGA wife, keeping her distance from the controversial views of her husband, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. As President Donald Trump’s second term has continued – and the Hines-Kennedy marriage has seemingly remained strong – however, that image has started to break down.\n\nHines just published her memoir, “Unscripted,” which details her journey from her Florida hometown to Hollywood to Washington. Along the way, it offers only glancing introspection on how Hines reconciles her former views as a Democrat with her new life. It is similarly vague on herpolitics, which she does not describe outright, but she declines to criticize her husband’s anti-vaccine brand of MAGA. Instead, she takes digs at her husband’s detractors, including the Kennedy family members who supported President Joe Biden and later, Vice President Kamala Harris, during the 2024 election.\n\nHines laid low for a little while after the inauguration, but in the lead-up to the book’s release, she has been a major presence on the talk show and podcast circuit. She spoke at an anti-vaccine conference last weekend in front of a poster of her book that read “HELP MAKE THIS BOOK A NYT BESTSELLER.” The book was published by Skyhorse, a right-leaning imprint whose author roster includes Trump allies Sean Spicer, Alan Dershowitz and Peter Navarro.\n\nHere are seven takeaways from “Unscripted”about her time in the political spotlight.\n\nHines really wants readers to believe she isn’t political.\n\nDescribing her Florida childhood, she says politics weren’t discussed in her house, and she doesn’t know who her parents voted for. When Trump won in 2016, Hines “listened to country music and cried for a few hours.”\n\nShe says she “detested” how the 2000 Bush/Gore recount was handled, but decided to “disconnect from politics, not that I had been extremely involved in the first place.” Besides, she notes in the same paragraph, a lot of good things had happened to her in the Bush years: “I was cast on ‘Curb Your Enthusiasm,’ nominated for an Emmy, got married to Paul [Young, her first husband], and had Cat,” her daughter. A former Democrat, she switched her party registration to independent when her husband did.\n\nHer life with Kennedy has always been interesting.\n\nAbout halfway through the book – after Hines details her childhood, breakthrough in the entertainment industry and work on “Curb,” and first marriage – her story with Kennedy begins. They met, as has been previously reported, through Hines’s “Curb” co-star Larry David, at a 2005 ski fundraiser event for Kennedy’s Waterkeeper organization. They reconnected in 2011 when both were in the process of divorcing their spouses.\n\nHines described an early date of theirs, for which Kennedy took her on a boat ride to the Statue of Liberty, a night that made her swoon: “I would’ve sworn I was dreaming, but my feet were cold and the rancid smell of roadkill in Bobby’s minivan was enough to know all of it was real.” His proposal, she says, was impromptu, at a lake near Orlando, in front of Hines’s daughter,as well as her niece and nephew. They celebrated their wedding with a clambake at the Kennedy family compound.\n\nBeing with Kennedy opened up a life even more exciting than her Hollywood one, she says. She visited Cuba with him, meeting Fidel Castro: “Bobby and Castro talked for hours. They spoke about unsuccessful assassination attempts orchestrated by the US on Castro’s life. Bobby and Castro agreed his father and uncle were never involved.”\n\nHer life with Kennedy has been wild in numerous ways. She recounts getting charged by a yak in Bhutan, and attacked by Toby, an emu that Kennedy got as a present for Hines’s daughter, Cat: “It got to the point where I couldn’t go into the backyard without carrying a shovel for protection.”\n\nAs for the most notorious story about Kennedy’s nonhuman companions, his own claim that he had contracted a brain worm, Hines dispatches with the parasite – and the media attention it attracted – quickly.\n\n“I will admit, that story was one of the most entertaining,” she writes.\n\nShe tries to skirt the vaccine conversation.\n\n“I would’ve been content to never have another discussion about vaccines again,” Hines writes, of getting her covid vaccination (which she notes was “required” for her work on “Curb”), “but that wasn’t going to be the case.” Given her speaking role last weekend at the annual Children’s Health Defense conference, it’s hard to take that remark seriously. “Both sides of the vaccine safety debate … are ultimately motivated by the same goal: protecting children’s health,” she later writes.\n\nHines writes that she didn’t like Kennedy’s combative tone when he spoke about vaccines. “Sometimes I didn’t like the language he used,” writes Hines. “ … I wanted to talk to him about the complications his outspoken beliefs were creating for me and the family, but it seemed like our discussions would lead back to him showing me studies and facts and figures about why he had taken up the fight.”\n\nBut she is unsparing in her anger for an “untrustworthy political pundit friend” who had leaked to Politico that an invitation to a holiday party at her and Kennedy’s home suggested people self-test “or be vaccinated,” language that Hines says was inserted at the suggestion of her assistant.\n\nHines is angry at the Biden administration and the Kennedy family.\n\nWhen Kennedy was thinking about running for president, Hines was supportive but fearful for his safety. She remains angry at the Biden administration for denying Kennedy’s early requests for Secret Service protection, describing some of the threats their family endured. At one point, Hines was on an Instagram live stream with a friend, talking about her skin care company – a brand she mentions frequently – when she saw an intruder approach the house and be apprehended by their private security team (she kept it cool on the live stream and never let the audience know).\n\nShe frequently returns to her disappointment that many of Kennedy’s relatives did not support him – especially his siblings Joseph, Kerry, Kathleen, Max, Chris, and Rory – comparing them to a “swarm of bees.” She does not, naturally, delve into some of the remarks that may have caused them to distance themselves – for example, Kennedy’s onetime suggestion that covid was engineered to spare Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese people. (Kennedy has claimed that his remarks about covid being ethnically targeted were misunderstood.)\n\n“I also found myself sorry for them for choosing politics over family,” she wrote. “… I realized that they were not who I thought they were.”\n\nMeeting Trump made her break out in hives.\n\nHines recounts that she and Kennedy met with Trump in Milwaukee in 2024 shortly after he survived the July assassination attempt that wounded his ear. Hines had planned to join Kennedy after that meeting, but her husband’s security detail unexpectedly delivered her to the meeting, at his request. Trump shook her hand and “commented on my good reputation in the entertainment industry. I replied that he might be speaking too soon.” After talking about the assassination attempt, Trump dictated a tweet to his now-chief of staff Susie Wiles demanding Secret Service protection for Kennedy.\n\nThe moment she left the meeting, Hines “broke out into hives,” she says. “One of Bobby’s staff joked that I must’ve been allergic to President Trump.” A photo in the book shows her swollen, distended lips – an effect, doctors told her, of extreme stress.\n\nWhen Kennedy dropped out and endorsed Trump, Hines says she fielded “angry calls and texts” all night.\n\nHines’s friendships have suffered since her embrace of MAHA and MAGA.\n\nComedian Tig Notaro spoke last month about how she had to take a step back from the podcast she and Hines hosted together. Hines doesn’t have anything bad to say about Notaro in the book, though, saying, “Neither Tig nor I wanted to get bogged down in politics.”\n\nBut she’s still mad that Bradley Whitford, “an actor friend of mine,” criticized Hines in a tweet for staying “silent while your lunatic husband throws his support behind the adjudicated rapist who brags about stripping women of their fundamental rights.” She wonders,“Why didn’t Bradley just call me to see if he could talk me into revolting against my husband, if that was the goal?” She describes reading all the comments that attacked Whitford back as “oddly healing.”\n\nShe also calls out Laurie David, her co-star’s real-life ex-wife, who criticized her for attending her husband’s confirmation hearing, an event she approached using her acting training:Hines writes that she knew she would have to remain emotionless,comparing it to a scene from a film she had done with Richard Gere in which she had to play dead. “Even keeping as still as possible, with no notable expression, some late-night talk show hosts thought I was blinking too much, or perhaps I was blinking an SOS in Morse Code.”\n\nAt one point in the book, Kennedy tries to convince her to pretend she has left him, in order to preserve her Hollywood friendships.\n\n“He pitched me on the idea of a fake separation,” she wrote, but she didn’t think it was a good idea: “I imagined paparazzi lurking around, trying to get photos of us together so they could break a story about how we actually weren’t separated.”\n\nShe doesn’t mention Olivia Nuzzi by name.\n\nIn September 2024, then-New York magazine star reporter Nuzzi was placed on leave after she acknowledged she had a “personal,” nonphysical relationship with Kennedy, whom she profiled in November 2023. In the course of a short-lived legal dispute, Nuzzi’s former fiancé, then-Politico reporter Ryan Lizza said that Nuzzi described the affair as “toxic,” “psychotic” and “indefensible,” and that she said her affair partner was a “70-year-old ‘sex addict’ who told her he wanted to ‘possess,’ ‘control’ and ‘impregnate’ her,” though Kennedy was not named in the filing.\n\nThroughout this tawdry incident, Hines was top of mind for the gossiping masses: After she was spotted without her wedding ring shortly after the incident went public, many wondered if she would leave him.\n\nHines, who refers to Nuzzi only as a “political journalist,” writes that she was in Italy when she learned about the news.\n\n“My first reaction was a wave of indifference. I didn’t care about what had happened, who said what, what was real, what wasn’t real, who was involved or why they were involved,” she writes. “I was fine with letting them all continue with the drama and the politics without me … it was the end of the line for me.”\n\nWhen Hines returned from Europe, Kennedy picked her up from the airport, where they talked for an hour in their car while a security team watched. “I felt so distant from [Kennedy]. It seemed like the only threads that were connecting me to him were directly tied to all of our kids,” she writes. But they quickly reconciled: For the next few days, they “drilled down on the truth. We locked ourselves in our room and laid it all on the table.” Hines does not reveal what was discussed at all, but writes that the conversation “tightened our ties.”\n\nNuzzi, now an editor at Vanity Fair, will release her memoir next month.\n\nLauren Weber contributed to this report.","summary":"In “Unscripted,” the actress and wife of Robert F.

Kennedy’s grandson, Jack Schlossberg, has announced he is running to succeed longtime Congressman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., in representing New York’s 12th congressional district.\n\n“I’m running for Congress because the best part of the greatest city on earth needs to be heard loud and clear in Washington and deserves a representative who won’t back down,” the Kennedy scion’s campaign website reads.\n\n“In Ancient Greece there was a phrase: ‘e tàn e epì tâs,‘ or ‘either come with your shield, or leave on it,’” the website continues, explaining Schlossberg will stand strong in Congress.\n\nSchlossberg, 32, is the son of Caroline Kennedy, who served as the U.S. Ambassador to Australia during the Biden administration and the U.S. Ambassador to Japan during the Obama administration, and Edwin Schlossberg. He grew up in New York City attending the exclusive Collegiate School in the Upper West Side before heading to Yale and earning degrees from Harvard Law School and Harvard Business School. \n\nSchlossberg is a first cousin once removed of Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., of whom he has not been shy about criticizing. \n\n“I have no idea why anyone thinks he should be president,” Schlossberg said of his cousin’s 2024 bid, eventually campaigning for both then-President Joe Biden and then-Vice President Kamala Harris as they unsuccessfully sought to take on Donald Trump last year. \n\nWhen the elder Kennedy ended up endorsing Trump, Schlossberg wrote on X, “Never been less surprised in my life. Been saying it for over a year—RFK Jr. is for sale, works for Trump. Bedfellows and loving it. Kamala Harris is for the people—the easiest decision of all time just got easier.”\n\nDespite his illustrious political connections, Schlossberg may face stiff competition from New York assemblyman Micah Lasher, a former aide to Nadler and former director of state legislative affairs for then-New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg. Lasher has been called Nadler’s “heir apparent” by Politico. \n\n“[Lasher] has been the advisor, consigliere, trusted confidant of so many government officials throughout his relatively young life,” Democrat State Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal explained to the digital newspaper. \n\nAnother prominent primary opponent would be Liam Elkind, a nonprofit founder and former Rhodes Scholar, who has emphasized his youth (he is in his twenties) in a party known for its aging members. He had announced his primary challenge to Nadler before the 78-year-old congressman declared he would be retiring. \n\nNadler has served in Congress since 1992 and was chairman of the House Judiciary Committee from 2019 to 2023. His retirement was perhaps foreshadowed when he announced he would no longer seek to be the ranking member of the committee after Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., said he would run against him for the top Democrat spot.\n\nIn total, Ballotpedia has documented an astounding eight candidates who have filed for the Democrat primary election to succeed Nadler. The district is deep blue, encompassing much of Manhattan, meaning the primary will likely decide the victor in the general election.\n\nThe Daily Signal has reached out to the campaigns of Elkind, Lasher, Schlossberg, and the office of Nadler for comment.","summary":"Former President John F.

Charlotte Jones, who runs the famed Dallas Cowboys cheerleading team, called the NFL's choice to tap Bad Bunny \"awesome\" and \"amazing.\" The United States is a society \"based on immigrants that have come here and founded our country\" and \"we can celebrate that,\" Jones added during a podcast interview on \"The Katie Miller Podcast\" hosted by Katie Miller, the wife of top Trump aid Stephen Miller. Jones also argued during the podcast segment that football aims to \"avoid politics,\" despite Bad Bunny's politically polarizing brand. \"I think it's awesome, and I think our Latina fan base is amazing. And I think when you think about the Super Bowl you want the number one performer in the world to be there. We're on a global stage – and we can't ever forget that – our game goes out to everybody around the world. And to get the premier entertainer to want to be a part of our game, I think is amazing,\" Jones said when asked for her opinion about the selection of Bad Bunny for the Super Bowl halftime show.

I mean our whole society is based on immigrants that have come here and founded our country, and I think we can celebrate that, and I think the show is going to be amazing,\" she continued. However, Miller did not let Jones off easy, saying, \"You don't think that at a time when his comments were divisive as it relates to President Trump, when everyone is just seeking this political unification, that you'd want somebody who maybe didn't touch politics to be on that stage?\" \"I don't think our game is about politics. I don't think people tune in to look at politics. We do everything we can to avoid politics,\" Jones shot back. \"I think, in that moment, that people will be watching the game, they'll be celebrating music, and nobody will be thinking about whose – what's comments on the left side, what comments on the right side. This is about bringing people together.\" But, while Jones argues that the Super Bowl is not about politics, it certainly has been for Bad Bunny. JAY-Z DISMISSES BACKLASH OVER DECISION TO HAVE BAD BUNNY PERFORM SUPER BOWL LV HALFTIME SHOW The Puerto Rican-born artist, for example, has made politically driven touring choices. He committed ahead of his 2025-2026 tour to no stops in the United States, which the performer explained was due, at least in part, because of the country's crackdown on immigration. Bad Bunny, who performs the majority of his songs in Spanish, said he was protecting his fans from being nabbed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials while attending his shows. The soon-to-be Super Bowl halftime performer also explained that one of the reasons for not touring in the United States was because Puerto Rico, where he is from, is still not a state. But, at the same time, he has complained about ICE enforcement operations in the U.S. jurisdiction. \"Look, those motherf---ers are in these cars, RAV4s. They’re here on [Avenida] Pontezuela,\" the performer said of U.S. immigration officials arriving in the Puerto Rican city of Carolina, according to the Los Angeles Times. He lamented that they were going around arresting illegal immigrants \"instead of leaving the people alone and working.\" Meanwhile, the performer also endorsed Kamala Harris for president before she lost to Donald Trump. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP After Bad Bunny was selected by the NFL to be this year's halftime show, several rumors began circulating that multiple teams, including Jones' father's Cowboys, had petitioned the NFL to pick a new halftime performer.

The NFL has said they will not amend their choice, with the league's commissioner, Roger Goodell, stating the decision had been \"carefully thought through.\" \"I'm not sure we've ever selected an artist where we didn't have some blowback or criticism,\" Goodell said. \"It's pretty hard to do when you have literally hundreds of millions of people that are watching.\"","summary":"Charlotte Jones, daughter of Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, praised the NFL’s choice of Bad Bunny for the Super Bowl halftime show, saying it celebrates America’s immigrant roots.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dallas-cowboys-owners-daughter-surprising-admission-about-bad-bunny-super-bowl-outrage","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/10/charlotte-jones-.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-12 18:01:27","author":"Alec Schemmel","authors":["Alec Schemmel"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.066},{"id":378328414,"title":"Kamala: I Beat Donald Trump....at 3-D Chess. No, Really.","text":"No, really not. Apparently, no one has explained to Kamala Harris that Inauguration Day has come and gone, and that she didn't just take a gap year on the Joy McBrat Presidency. Instead of sitting in the Oval Office, Harris found herself on the set of the \"Storehouse & Friends\" podcast this weekend, plugging her memoir of the campaign and rewriting history.\n\nIn Kamala's case, rewriting history beats telling it honestly. And in her mind, \"beating\" Donald Trump consists of sticking to a losing strategy, because, er ... Star Trek, or something:\n\nWATCH:Kamala Harris says she wasn’t going to fall for Trump’s “traps” during the 2024 campaign and that she was playing “three-dimensional chess.” pic.twitter.com/etPX5LZjmm— Washington Free Beacon (@FreeBeacon) November 11, 2025\n\n“I was aware of my opponent’s strategy. And I wasn’t about to fall prey or fall into those traps,” Harris said.” And part of his strategy, and those around him, was to try and take me off our game and message.”“And I wasn’t about to be distracted by those flames that he was trying to throw to get me away from one of my highest priorit[ies], which was talking to people about the economy and their well-being, in terms of their financial well-being,” she added. “I understood the game that was being played and I made a decision that I wasn’t going to get played.”Harris then cackled for several seconds while at least one of the hosts said, “Chess, not checkers.”“Yeah. Three-dimensional chess,” Harris responded.\n\nI included this in last night's Final Word without much comment, because this is a truly flabbergasting claim. It takes a while to wrap one's head around the sheer scale of delusional thought that goes into this statement. Does Harris know that she lost the election? And not just by a thin margin either; Harris lost every swing state in the election and became the first Democrat in twenty years to lose the popular vote to a Republican nominee. \n\nShe's bragging about outsmarting Trump on strategic thinking from the set of a podcast, at the same time -- nearly in the same hour -- that Trump humbled the entire Democrat Party on Capitol Hill in the government shutdown. \n\nAnd how exactly did Harris use her insight into Trump's strategy? She claims that she focused on \"talking to the people about the economy and their well-being,\" but she did no such thing. She mainly hid behind the celebrities she paid to appear at her rallies, barely spoke otherwise, and hid from reporters until nearly the end of her campaign. When she did speak to reporters, it was such a disaster that 60 Minutes and CBS News had to heavily edit her answers to make them seem coherent. CBS and Paramount later paid a $16 million settlement with Trump over that corrupt act. \n\nBesides, Harris' main message wasn't about the economy. It was the continuation of the Biden campaign's main message that Trump was disqualified for office, and that she should win by default. Harris, or whoever was actually trying to play 3-D chess, structured that message to deflect from Harris' complete incompetence. Democrats hoped to force the election to be a referendum on Trump rather than the fiasco-ridden Biden administration. That was the only way that Harris could compete, and for that matter, to argue earlier that a senile Joe Biden would be a better choice than his predecessor.\n\nIt didn't work, of course, even if Harris hasn't yet noticed. Well, those books won't just sell themselves, I suppose, but why would anyone buy a campaign memoir from someone whose memories of the campaign are every bit as bad as her former boss' about everything else?\n\nThis absurd attempt at spin does raise another interesting point, though. One has to wonder why Democrats didn't adopt the same aphasiac spin about the Schumer Shutdown itself after Sunday night. It's really a win! Trust us! We played 3-D chess with Trump! Maybe there isn't enough box wine in the world to sell that to progressives. \n\nEditor’s Note: Every single day, here at Hot Air, we will stand up and FIGHT, FIGHT, FIGHT against the radical left and deliver the conservative reporting our readers deserve.

However, Collins has proven to be able to win in tough environments in the past, including in 2020, when she won despite former President Joe Biden easily winning the Pine Tree State.\n\nPlatner has become a favorite among the party’s left flank, but a series of scandals surrounding old Reddit posts and a tattoo appearing to use Nazi imagery have threatened to derail his campaign. He is facing Governor Mills, a more moderate Democrat who has earned backing of the party establishment, in the primary. A new poll reveals how those scandals have affected his chances against Collins if he were to win the party’s nomination.\n\nWhat to Know\n\nA new poll conducted on behalf of the Democratic organization EMILYs List—which has endorsed Mills—was made public on Wednesday. It delivered troubling news for the Platner campaign. Most voters in Maine would prefer to reelect Collins over Platner, according to the survey first reported by Politico.\n\nCollins held a nine-point lead over Platner in the poll (51 percent to 42 percent). When respondents were provided more information about Platner’s scandals, Collins’ lead grew to 19 points (57 percent to 38 percent). Collins still led by 14 points after respondents were given a response by Platner (55 percent to 41 percent).\n\nDemocratic Senate candidate Graham Platner speaks in Ogunquit, Maine on October 22, 2025.\n\nIt surveyed 700 likely voters from October 22-27 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.7 percentage points.\n\nThe poll found that Maine voters would still prefer to vote for Democrats on a generic ballot by a nine-point margin (46 percent to 37 percent), and that Collins’ approval remains underwater, with 54 percent disapproving of her performance and 44 percent giving her positive marks.\n\nNotably, it did not include a question about the hypothetical matchup between Mills and Collins, or the Democratic primary.\n\nCNN first reported Platner’s resurfaced Reddit posts on October 16. Posts ranged from identifying as a “communist” to comments about rural white voters.\n\nIn a 2020 Reddit thread titled “White people aren’t as racist or stupid as Trump thinks,” he responded: “Living in white rural America, I’m afraid to tell you they actually are.”\n\nIn a second round of resurfaced posts reported by The Bangor Daily News on October 17, he reportedly posted a question about Black people not tipping and a post about sexual assault victims. He allegedly wrote that people should “take some responsibility for themselves and not get so f***** up they wind up having sex with someone they don’t mean to?”\n\nHe has also faced backlash over his tattoo that resembled the Totenkopf, or “death’s head,” a symbol adopted by Nazis.\n\nPlatner has apologized for the posts and tattoo. He told The Associated Press he has covered the tattoo and said he was unaware the symbol was linked to Nazism. He told CNN the posts were “very much me f****** around the internet.”\n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\nPollster Adam ZCarlson raised concerns about the poll on X: “If you’re an org backing Mills trying to push a narrative that Platner is unelectable with hard numbers, sorry but you’re gonna have to show your work.”\n\nMaine State Representative Laurel Libby, a Republican, wrote on X: “You mean Mainers don’t want an avowed Communist as their Senator?”\n\nZeteo Politics Editor Andrew Perez wrote on X: “Mills and her allies are trying to end Platner’s grassroots campaign without doing any actual work. So far, there is little sign of a Mills Senate campaign in Maine. EMILY’s List for some reason didn’t bother to include Mills in this poll.”\n\nWhat Happens Next\n\nCandidates will spend the coming months making their cases to Mainers about why they are the strongest candidates in the Senate race. Forecasters like the Cook Political Report and Sabato’s Crystal Ball classify the race as a pure toss-up.","summary":"A new poll showed GOP Senator Collins with a lead over Platner in the Maine Senate race, viewed as a must-win for Democrats.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/graham-platner-chances-susan-collins-blow-maine-poll-11035208","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2242325826-1.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-12 17:35:39","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.16},{"id":378315154,"title":"Photo Of Event In The Oval Office Turns Heads After People Spot Small Detail","text":"Concerns about President Donald Trump’s health have surfaced once again after footage from a recent White House press conference showed him sitting back in his Oval Office chair with his eyes closed — just as Dr. Mehmet Oz spoke about the link between obesity and dementia.\n\nThe moment, caught on camera during an event announcing a major new partnership between the Trump administration and pharmaceutical giants Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, has since spread rapidly across social media. The deal aims to lower prices and expand coverage for popular weight-loss medications, including Zepbound and Wegovy — drugs that have seen skyrocketing demand across the country.\n\nAs cameras rolled, Dr. Oz, who currently leads the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, stood at the podium detailing the serious health consequences linked to obesity. “Knees don’t hurt, people don’t have heart attacks, renal failure, dementia — all the things we know are associated with obesity and much more,” he stated.\n\nBut while Dr. Oz spoke, President Trump appeared to lean back in his chair and briefly close his eyes, leading critics to speculate that he may have dozed off during the live broadcast.\n\nMike Nellis, a senior organizer for Kamala Harris’ campaign, wasted no time mocking the moment online, posting on X: “Dr. Oz connecting obesity to dementia while Trump’s slumped over at his desk is absolutely a choice.”\n\nOthers followed suit, posting old photos and videos of Trump appearing to rest during past events. One user joked, “Self-awareness level: minus 348.” Another quipped, “Hey Dr. Oz — have you checked out your Big Mac boss lately?”\n\nWhen the clip made its way to Reddit, commenters piled on with humor. “Wasn’t this the same event where the pharma exec passed out? What a well-oiled machine our executive branch is today,” one wrote. Another added, “I love that Dr. Oz is talking about people being able to sleep — as Trump is literally sleeping in the background.”\n\nThe incident added fuel to a broader media narrative questioning Trump’s energy and mental sharpness. The president recently raised eyebrows during a 60 Minutes interview when asked about several policy issues. When questioned about his decision to pardon crypto mogul Changpeng Zhao — whose firm prosecutors claimed posed a national security risk — Trump responded, “Okay, are you ready? I don’t know who he is,” he said, adding that the situation was nothing more than “Biden witch hunt.”\n\nHe also made headlines when asked about Venezuela, saying, “I doubt it, I don’t think so. They’ve been treating us very badly, not only on drugs. They’ve dumped hundreds of thousands of people into our country that we didn’t want.”\n\nThe press conference itself was not short on chaos.

John Fetterman raged at ‘f—ing a—hole’ Josh Shapiro, reveals why their relationship ‘never recovered’ in new memoir","text":"WASHINGTON — John Fetterman blurted “f—ing a—hole” into a hot mic during a heated 2020 Zoom hearing involving then-Keystone State Attorney General Josh Shapiro as tensions between Pennsylvania’s two highest-ranking Democrats reached a boiling point, Fetterman’s new memoir reveals.\n\nThe then-lieutenant governor’s outburst came after Shapiro delivered a “very long-winded and unnecessary” speech justifying his decision to vote against commuting the sentences of Lee and Dennis Horton, two brothers who were convicted of second-degree murder in a fatal 1993 robbery and shooting.\n\nFetterman and Shapiro sat on Pennsylvania’s Board of Pardons together and Shapiro had expressed concern that transcripts from the siblings’ original trial were missing.\n\nThe now-senator was so outraged by Shapiro’s intransigence that Fetterman threatened in a private meeting to run for governor in 2022 and pull the then-AG into a bruising primary.\n\n“I told him there were two tracks — that one and the one in which he ran for governor and I ran for the Senate (which was the one I preferred),“ Fetterman writes in his new book, “Unfettered,” as excerpted by the Philadelphia Inquirer\n\n”I had no interest in friction, only in what I felt was justice.”\n\nSoon after, Shapiro staffer Joe Radosevich reached out to Fetterman.\n\n“He wanted me to retract things I had said and to deny the rumors about the private meeting taking place,” the senator writes. “That wasn’t going to happen.”\n\nThe board voted in December 2020 to commute the Hortons’ sentences, and Fetterman invited Dennis Horton to be his guest at the 2023 State of the Union address.\n\nHowever, the relationship with Shapiro “never recovered.”\n\n“I sincerely wish him the best,” Fetterman writes of the governor. “He is a credit to the state and may one day be a credit to the country. I remember fondly the days when we were nobodies trying to climb the ladder. Even if we no longer speak.”\n\nExplaining the roots of their feud on the parole board, the senator writes that “I truly believed with all my heart that nobody I ever supported for a pardon was a danger to society. I was willing to stake my political career on it.”\n\n“[Shapiro] was far more cautious, and at a certain point, I began to think that what was influencing him was not mere caution but political ambition.”\n\nAt one meeting, Fetterman recalled, Shapiro voted against parole in 12 of 15 cases, causing the lieutenant governor to break his reading glasses in frustration. \n\n“I believe what drove him to delay and deny applications was not the facts of a given case as much as a fear that someone whose sentence he’d commuted would go on to commit terrible violence on the outside,” Fetterman added.\n\nDuring the 2024 campaign, Fetterman privately confided his apprehension about Shapiro to former Vice President Kamala Harris’ team as they considered potential running mates, Politico reported at the time.\n\nHarris revealed in her recent memoir, “107 Days,” that she had “had a nagging concern that” Shapiro “would be unable to settle for a role as number two and that it would wear on our partnership.”\n\nShapiro, one of the most popular governors in the country, is heavily favored to win re-election next year and has been floated as a potential 2028 presidential candidate. \n\nA rep for Shapiro did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \n\n“Unfettered” is available wherever books are sold.","summary":"Pennsylvania Sen.

The Senate has passed the slightly amended continuing resolution; now, the House will vote on the funding extension. The House Rules Committee worked past midnight to pass the bill to a general rules vote, which will be held today. Democrats attempted and failed to force votes on amendments related to their pet ObamaCare subsidies. Interestingly, while Senate Republicans promised Democrats a vote on those subsidies in early December, House Republicans have made no such promise. If the CR passes the rules vote, as expected, it will then be open to debate before being put to a final vote tonight, advancing the legislation to President Donald Trump’s desk.\nLeftmedia comes clean: With the Senate Democrats finally ending their record-long government shutdown, the Big Three legacy media networks — ABC, CBS, and NBC — suddenly changed their tune. Having misinformed the American public by primarily blaming Republicans for the shutdown, the networks finally admitted the shutdown was the Democrats’ doing. A despondent NBC’s “Today” reported that “the reason Democrats had pushed for the shutdown in the first place” failed and that seven Democrat senators “decided it was time to bring the shutdown to an end.” CBS anchor Tony Dokoupil observed that Democrats chose to “drive the country into a shutdown,” and their base is now angry. ABC’s Rachel Scott reported that “it was Senate Democrats who backed away from what they’ve been demanding all along.” Maybe this shutdown would have been much shorter if these networks had accurately reported that Democrats were responsible for it in the first place.\n\nSNAP fight reaches SCOTUS: Lawsuits attempting to force the Department of Agriculture to find funding for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program payments that go out to nearly one in eight Americans were successful last week before the Supreme Court answered an emergency request on Friday to freeze some lower-court orders. The initial freeze offered by Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson would have expired on Tuesday if the Court had not extended it to Thursday at 11:59 p.m., this time against Justice Jackson’s wishes. The Supreme Court did not explain its decision, which is not unusual for emergency requests. However, given the recent movement on the CR to fund the government, it’s likely that the Court hopes Congress will provide funding through ordinary means, thereby rendering the question moot.\nUK sides with narco-terrorists: Apparently, the current leadership of the United Kingdom would rather see illicit drugs flow into the U.S. than see them stopped. That is effectively the message that was sent after the UK said it was suspending the sharing of some intel with the U.S. over the Trump administration’s recent strikes taking out cartel drug boats. Reportedly, the UK prefers not to be complicit in “illegal” U.S. military strikes. So, America’s closest ally doesn’t want to share intel because it thinks attacking drug-smuggling terrorists is illegal. Based upon what? Evidently, past practices, when those criminals ferrying illicit drugs, responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of Americans annually, were simply detained and had their illicit cargo seized. In war, killing the enemy ends the enemy’s war efforts.\nAntifa vs. TPUSA: The Turning Point USA tour that Charlie Kirk began on his last day on earth in Utah ended on Monday at UC Berkeley, where Antifa thugs tried to stop the event. One arrest for battery occurred before the event even started, and one TPUSA supporter was seen on video being assaulted and trying to flee Antifa. Police later detained that man with blood pouring down his face before identifying him as a victim. At one point, a car backfired with a sound like gunshots, and it was greeted with raucous cheers. Andy Ngo reported that the protest was organized by a group called By Any Means Necessary. TPUSA noted that inside the police barricade, the event went off without a hitch. Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon suggested that the DOJ will investigate possible First and Fourteenth Amendment violations, and UC Berkeley has promised to cooperate.\nHochul shuts down Mamdani’s free child care promise: In his successful bid to become New York City’s next mayor, Zohran Mamdani promised a litany of freebies, including free child care. The estimated annual cost of providing “free” child care to NYC residents is roughly $6 billion, equal to the NYPD’s entire budget. Mamdani’s answer to that massive cost is higher taxes, but here’s the catch: taxes fall under the purview of the state government, and Governor Kathy Hochul is in no mood to sign off on such a significant tax increase. Hochul is facing a significant election challenge from popular Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik. The last thing Hochul wants to do is alienate New York voters outside of NYC who are already paying some of the highest taxes in the country.\n\nCFPB to run out of money as DOJ rules its funding is illegal: The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an independent and arguably unconstitutional executive agency established during the Obama presidency, will run out of money next year. The CFPB, intentionally designed to avoid accountability, draws its funding directly from the Federal Reserve rather than from Congress. However, the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel has determined that money can flow to the CFPB only when the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet shows a profit, which has not occurred since 2022. Given this reality, the CFPB’s funding will run out in early 2026, effectively shutting down the agency. CFPB could go to Congress with hat in hand and ask for a direct appropriation of cash, but this will likely fall on deaf ears given that Republicans control the legislature.\nThe frontrunner for Nancy Pelosi’s seat makes it clear where he stands: California State Senator Scott Wiener had a chance to engage with concerned voters on Monday, during which he made his priorities abundantly clear. The man who is poised to succeed one of the most influential American female politicians of all time was forthright: he stands with men — that is, “trans women” — over women. Tish Hyman, who gained national attention last week for objecting to a man undressing in her locker room at Gold’s Gym, asked Wiener about how he’d ensure women would “be protected from men.” Wiener responded with leftist dogma: “trans women are women.” For those who ply in identity politics, crossdressing men are more important than women.\nDHS says surging number of terror suspects at border is good news: Despite DHS closing out the 2025 fiscal year with the best border numbers in five decades, one category did not show a significant drop — the number of terrorist suspects nabbed crossing the border. The number increased nearly 30-fold — from several dozen a month to more than 950 in September alone. According to the DHS, that’s a good thing. Since the Trump administration has classified certain drug cartels like MS-13 and Tren de Aragua as terrorist organizations, the numbers have skyrocketed — not because more of them are crossing into the U.S., but because they are actually being flagged via the terrorism watch list. “The elevated number of TSDS matches is not a surge in new threats,” said U.S. CBP Commissioner Rodney Scott. “It’s the result of properly identifying the dangerous actors who were always there.”\n\nEpstein: Trump “asked Ghislaine Maxwell to stop” recruiting girls from Mar-a-Lago spa (NY Post)\nJeffries, Democrats will offer three-year extension of ObamaCare subsidies (The Hill)\n“Operation Dirtbag” sees over 150 illegal migrant sexual predators nabbed in Florida (NY Post)\nU.S. to mint its last penny as Treasury halts production (Fox Business)\nCalifornia illegally issued 17,000 commercial driver’s licenses (Transportation.gov)\nVirginia redistricting push leader used campaign funds on family business, daughter’s campaign, steaks (Washington Examiner)\nGoogle lawsuit accuses China-based cybercriminals of massive text-message phishing scams (CBS News)\nHumor: Congress prepares to pivot from doing nothing because of the shutdown to doing nothing because they’re Congress (Babylon Bee)\n\nFor the Executive Summary archive, click here.\n\nComment | Share\n\nFEATURED ANALYSIS\n\nAffordability Can Change Everything\n\nNate Jackson\n\nThe word of the year might be “affordability.” How the two political parties address that issue will, in large measure, determine who wins the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nPresident Donald Trump says, “I don’t want to hear about the affordability,” dismissing it as a “dead” issue, which doesn’t seem like a good start. Still, as usual, Trump’s brash New Yorker style can mask the fact that he makes some good points:\n\n“It was a con job, affordability,” he argued recently regarding Democrat wins in the off-year elections. “It was a con job by the Democrats. The Democrats are good at a few things — cheating on elections and conning people with facts that aren’t true. We are much better than [former President Joe] Biden and all of them now, just so you understand. Do you remember that the Biden administration had the highest inflation in 48 years? The reason I don’t want to talk about affordability is because everybody knows that it’s far less expensive under Trump than it was under sleepy Joe Biden.”\n\nFirst, he’s absolutely correct that inflation is at a far better annual rate now than it was under Biden and the Democrats, whose American Rescue Plan plunged the nation into a battle with inflation that hit generational highs and persists nearly five years later. Trump won in 2024 because voters were fed up with Bidenomics.\n\nSecond, he’s wrong to dismiss affordability. Prices are cumulatively almost 25% higher now than when Trump left office in 2021.\n\nI don’t know about you, but every time I buy something, I have at least a momentary flare of aggravation that stuff is so darn expensive now. Just for starters, that fast-food meal you could get for $7 in 2020 is now almost twice that much. That ain’t “3% inflation.” Gas prices may be back down, and a Thanksgiving meal might cost a little less than last year, but the latter is only because beef (up 15% since last year) isn’t usually on the menu.\n\nWant to buy a house? Prices are up 56% since 2020. Over the same stretch, thanks to rising interest rates and other factors like insurance and property taxes, monthly payments are up 80%. The median age of the first-time homebuyer has reached an all-time high of 40 — up from 33 in 2021. Young people no longer feel like owning a home is even remotely within reach.\n\nThe bottom line is that Americans simply feel poorer, and telling them they shouldn’t feel that way — as Democrats and the Leftmedia tried in 2024 — is not a recipe for winning.\n\nTrump’s larger point might be that it’s frustrating that this issue hasn’t sunk the Democrat Party. Democrats — with zero Republican votes — “rescued” America by causing rampant inflation. Their Inflation Reduction Act a year later was a scam to pass as much of the Green New Deal as possible. Even Joe Biden later admitted it had nothing to do with reducing inflation. The Schumer Shutdown charade over ObamaCare is another unaffordability crisis entirely of Democrats’ making.\n\nWhy is anyone even talking about affordability? Because Democrats make stuff unaffordable!\n\nUnfortunately, Democrats have the Leftmedia at their disposal, so millions of Americans will hear the message that Democrats care more about affordability than Republicans do. Democrats want to “lower the cost” of your health insurance. Democrats want to raise the minimum wage, feed the hungry, pay for child care, and give away tax dollars on any number of other income redistribution schemes aimed at pulling heartstrings and winning votes with “free” stuff.\n\nAs for the GOP, National Review’s Mark Antonio Wright issues a warning: “The issue of affordability — high prices, high interest rates, inflation, sluggish wage growth — will be everything next year. If Republicans don’t figure out a way to address that priority, no amount of complaining about Zohran Mamdani and the rise of socialism is going to save them.”\n\nAt some level, President Trump understands that his party has to address affordability. The bad news is that he’s doing it by behaving like a Democrat.\n\nWhether he uses the word affordability or not, his two big proposals in recent days are aimed directly at people feeling the pinch of rising expenses. In a tacit admission that tariffs are a tax on American consumers, Trump has been pushing $2,000 rebate checks for every American (“not including high income people!”). He boasts that the U.S. is bringing in so much revenue from tariffs that the American people should reap the benefits. In reality, such rebate checks could end up being inflationary, just like the direct transfer payments made under both his and Biden’s administrations during COVID. It also won’t help pay down the national debt, which he promised to do with that revenue.\n\nThe other proposal is a 50-year mortgage option. This idea may be worth its own analysis, but suffice it to say that stretching a mortgage out that long might save a few bucks in monthly payments, but it will rob homeowners of equity and cost them a pretty penny in higher interest rates. You’d be better off renting than “owning” a house by making payments that last a lifetime. It will also cause prices to rise even further.\n\nOn a related note, Trump has been pushing for lower interest rates for months. While all of us would love for mortgage rates to drop, reducing rates too soon is not helping tamp down persistent inflation.\n\nThe good news is that many of Trump’s other policies are exactly what the economy needs. His focus on energy development, domestic manufacturing, foreign investment, and rare earths will all boost the American economy. Making his 2017 tax cuts permanent has helped Americans at almost every economic level. Those are the things he and every Republican should tout, all while reminding voters just how expensive “free” stuff ends up being.\n\nFollow Nate Jackson on X.\n\nComment | Share\n\nMORE ANALYSIS\n\nEmmy Griffin: Pelosi’s Likely Successor Dwarfs Her Radicalism — Scott Wiener, a kink-festival-loving state senator, wants to make a big splash on the national stage by codifying his extremist policies for all of America.\nSophie Starkova: Sports Integrity at the Olympics — The International Olympic Committee hasn’t banned men pretending to be women yet, but it’s heading in that direction.\nMichael Swartz: The Continuing Decline — and Hypocrisy — of Joe Biden — The former president — Hunter Biden’s “Big Guy” — trotted out recently to give a lecture about how the Trumps are supposedly getting rich off the presidency.\nThomas Gallatin: Are Offshore Wind Farms a Threat to Human Life? — HHS Secretary RFK Jr. has directed the CDC’s National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health to study and report on the impact of offshore wind farms on humans.\nGary Bauer: The Terror Plot Too Big for Media Attention? — At least six young people have been arrested in multiple states related to a terror plot planned for Hallowe'en.\n\nBEST OF RIGHT OPINION\n\n Byron York\n\n Why Did Democrats Fight So Long — Before Caving?\n\n Star Parker\n\n How Should Republicans Move Forward?\n\n Ian Haworth\n\n I Hope Trump Destroys the BBC\n\n Betsy McCaughey\n\n The Home Affordability Crisis — Not Fake News\n\n Allen West\n\n You Reap What You Sow\n\nFor more of today’s columns, visit Right Opinion.\n\nBEST OF VIDEOS\n\nWhy Won’t Tucker Carlson Push Back Against Certain Guests? — Carlson’s immense popularity among conservatives reveals an alarming truth about our side: we’ve forgotten how to make good arguments that promote our worldview.\nConfronting Conservative Antisemitism — Victor Davis Hanson explains how conservative icons like William F.

David argues that the fight within the Democratic Party about ending the shutdown isn’t about the shutdown itself; rather, it’s about the future face of the party. David argues that now is a good moment to make a deal and that the Democrats have accomplished all they could hope to from the shutdown. He also cautions that allowing the left wing of the Democrats’ base to use any potential deal as a means to push the party in a more confrontational, more radical path must be avoided.\n\nThen David is joined by The Bulwark’s Sarah Longwell. David and Sarah discuss the exit polls from this year’s elections and the current state of play within the American electorate. Sarah discusses how the increasing gender gap in voting patterns reflects a broader polarization between higher- and lower-information voters. Sarah also discusses how Donald Trump has upended everything we thought we knew about voting patterns and the uneasy position Republicans find themselves in once he’s off the ballot.\n\nFinally, David closes with a talk about The Emergency, a new novel by The Atlantic’s George Packer.\n\nThe following is a transcript of the episode:\n\nDavid Frum: Hello, and welcome back to The David Frum Show. I’m David Frum, a staff writer at The Atlantic. My guest this week will be Sarah Longwell, known to so many of you from her many TV appearances discussing her focus groups. We’re going to be talking about the recent 2025 November elections, what they tell us about the American electorate, and especially what they tell us about the enormous gender gap that has opened between the voting patterns of women and men, and especially the youngest women and the youngest men. What is going on with the young voters who turned out, the women, so overwhelmingly for Democratic candidates in 2025? So I’ll be talking to Sarah about that.\n\nMy book this week will be a new novel by my Atlantic colleague George Packer. The novel is called The Emergency, and it’s a haunting portrait of a world in decline that bears important resemblances to our own while clearly not being our own. It is a disturbing but beautiful work, and I strongly recommend it, and I’ll talk at the end of this podcast about why the book so spoke to me.\n\nBut before any of that, I wanna offer some thoughts about the ending of the government shutdown. I’m recording this podcast on Monday, November 10, so the deal to end the government shutdown has not quite been concluded as I speak, but a conclusion of some kind is imminent, accelerated perhaps by the havoc of this past weekend of air travel, one of the worst weekends for air travel in the United States since 9/11, that has left many people delayed or outright stranded, flights canceled. And as the government shutdown has come to an end, there’s been an upsurge of protest and outright anger from some of the most active and committed Democrats that they have been sold out by their party, having led the longest shutdown in American history, and many on the Democratic side think that there’s been a kind of sellout or disappointment. I wanna put some context on this because I don’t agree with any of that, and I think the Democrats are in danger of making some very bad decisions in reaction to the impulses and pressure from their most activist wing.\n\nIt’s important to understand that many Washington arguments are not actually about what they purport to be about. When Democrats argue about the ending of the government shutdown, they’re not just arguing about that. What they’re really arguing about is: What should the future face of the Democratic Party look like? Should it be more radical, more confrontational? Or should it be trying to find some kind of alignment with a broader consensus in American society? And one of the reasons that the figures in the Democratic Party who have led the negotiation to end the government shutdown have come under such fire is they are attractive targets for a party some of whose leading voices wanna remake the party entirely, in a much more militant way.\n\nNow, let’s talk about the merits of the complaint before we get to the larger discussion that this complaint stands in for. First, the merits of the complaint: There was no way the shutdown was going to end any way differently from the way it did. The only question was how long it would take. Would the Democrats arrive at their present outcome in 20 days or 30 or 40—or, as some now wish, 50? But if this shutdown went on for 10 more days or 12 more days, if it spoiled Thanksgiving travel, the outcome of the shutdown would be in no way different. What this shutdown was ostensibly about was the renewal of tax credits under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nNow, I’m gonna go into some detail here because we need to be clear about the unrealism of the demands. So the Affordable Care Act, of course, was passed by President [Barack] Obama. It went into effect in 2014. And among its provisions were a series of tax credits to subsidize the purchase of health insurance by people whose incomes were below a certain level. Those tax credits were in effect from 2014 to 2020. During the pandemic, President [Joe] Biden made the tax credits temporarily more generous in 2021, and the next year, in 2022, he extended those more generous tax credits until 2025—he and the Democratic Congress of that time. The tax credits were written by President Biden to expire, and the reason they were written to expire, well, it was twofold. First, they were really expensive. And many even in President Biden’s own party didn’t think that this level of expense, which was justified by the pandemic, should go on forever. And anyway, there are budget rules where, if you had made the tax credits permanent, you would’ve needed a bigger voting majority to pass them into law than was needed when they were made temporary. So it was President Biden and the Democratic Congress of 2021 and 2022 that made them temporary in the first place.\n\nNow, had the Democrats won the election of 2024, I’m sure that President Kamala Harris would’ve tried to make the tax credits more permanent, either extend them for a long period of time or write them into law altogether. And if she had carried a Democratic House with her and enough Democratic senators, maybe she would’ve been successful, but probably not, because unless she had a very liberal Senate, they probably would’ve flinched from the cost. So these tax credits were on their way out anyway.\n\nNow, that is a counterfactual speculation because, of course, the important point is she lost, and it didn’t happen. And there was no way that they were going to be continued indefinitely by a President Trump administration; the votes just weren’t there to do it. So when the Democrats made this big demonstration, they were engaged not in a real-world legislating exercise. The votes were never there to do what the Democrats wanted. There was no amount of shutdown that would ever change the votes and conjure them into being. The question for Democrats was: How did they drive home the point that President Trump was not as keen on health-care credits as they were? How did they message that? And the shutdown was their chosen way of messaging.\n\nShutdowns come with a lot of pain. They do a lot of harm to the economy. In this case, they brought harm to people who depend on federal food-aid relief. They brought harm to air travelers. They brought harm to many, many people: government employees, who expect their salary to be paid on time, and military people, civilian people. They bring disruption. They are very painful events, and they should not be accepted as regular parts of American life, although that’s what they have become.\n\nBut the contest in a shutdown is to use this pain as a kind of teaching exercise. Normally, the party that initiates the shutdown fails, not only fails on getting what it wants—everyone always fails; they never succeed in getting you what they want—but they also fail even to change the conversation. When Newt Gingrich shut down the government in 1994 and ’95 under President [Bill] Clinton, he was trying to drive home a message of budget austerity affecting even the Medicare program. Not only did he fail to get what he wanted from Medicare, but he contributed to the fallen popularity of the Republican Congress, first elected in 1994, and helped to reelect Bill Clinton. When President Trump, in 2018, 2019, shut down the government to try to force funds for the border wall—billions of dollars for a new border wall—he didn’t get the money. But he also drove home the point that the Trump priorities were not the same as the priorities of the American voter, that he was not the voter for the average person that he had represented himself as in 2016. And again, that government shutdown was an important reason why President Trump lost reelection in 2020, along, of course, with the COVID nightmare.\n\nThis time, Democrats had better success. Of course, they didn’t get their tax-credit extension. They were never going to. That was never a reasonable thing to expect or imagine or hope for. But what they did do was actually score political points against the Trump administration in a way that the Republican shutdowns of the past had never been able to do. They drove home the point that there is chaos because of Trump, not because of the Democrats, who actually were the people who shut down the government: The chaos is because of Trump. The airline-travel chaos is because of Trump. Trump wants to stop food stamps. And Trump is doing all of this because he wants to take away your health-care credits, and he doesn’t have any kind of health-care plan of his own, and neither does his party. That messaging was very successful by the standards of past shutdowns. Surveys showed that more Americans blamed the Republicans for the shutdown than Democrats, and surveys showed President Trump’s standing declining steadily.\n\nIt didn’t help that, while people were going without food stamps, while air travel was snarled, while government workers were going unpaid, Trump’s top priority seemed to be this fantasy he has a giant gilded ballroom where the East Wing used to stand of the White House, and they drove home that his priorities were different from everyone else’s.\n\nSo it was as successful as such a jagged weapon can ever be, and it would not get more successful if it had gone on longer. They would’ve done more harm. There is no reason to believe that it would’ve continued to subtract from President Trump’s strength. It might well have gone into reverse at some point and subtracted from the Democrats’ strength. They scored their messaging win. They proved it in the elections of November 2025, where Democrats won so dramatically in New Jersey and Virginia—and other places as well—and now it was time to pocket the winnings and leave the table. And that is what the Democratic leadership has done; there’s going to be, it looks like, some kind of deal.\n\nBut many on the Democratic activist side are saying these people are sellouts. Now, when they say that—The people who made the deal, they are sellouts—when they say that, it’s not because they really think that, if this shutdown had continued longer, that Democrats would’ve won on the tax-credits point. That was never going to happen. And it’s not because they even really think that they would’ve scored some other win. One of the big fantasy ideas that Democrats have—or certain activist Democrats—is if the shutdown had gone on a little longer, President Trump would’ve been forced to tell his Republican senators, Abolish the filibuster so that we can pass a budget without the Democrats at all. And a lot of the activist Democrats want the filibuster abolished. But that probably wasn’t going to happen either.\n\nMy guess is what would’ve happened is President Trump would’ve counted on hostage-taking, would’ve used the shutdown to inflict more pain on Democratic constituencies, especially this food-stamps problem—or Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program; it’s no longer called food stamps—where he was inflicting real pain on very vulnerable Americans and real pain on the federal workforce. And in the end, Democrats were going to care about that pain more than he did. And he would’ve gambled—and the Republicans in Congress would’ve gambled—that at some point, maybe some near point, public perceptions might flip, and the harm that the shutdown was doing to Republicans and Trump in the polls would redound instead upon the Democrats, who, after all, were the real authors of the shutdown. So it was a good moment to call it quits.\n\nBut the people on the Democratic activist side, having seen it called quits, now wanna use the calling it quits as a weapon of power inside the Democratic Party to push the party in a more confrontational, more radical path—more like these insurgent candidates like [Zohran] Mamdani in New York and others elsewhere—and against the traditional Democratic consensus, which will have the effect of making them more powerful while making the party less electable in most places in the elections of 2026 and 2028. If there are free and fair elections in ’26, ’28—which is a big if; we’re worried about that—but if there are, that doesn’t give the Democrats a pass to abandon the process, to abandon the work of being competitive for the votes in the center and the broad middle of American society. Assuming the elections are free and fair, they still have to compete and win, and that means coming forward with consensus candidates, candidates who look more like all of America and not just the activist wing.\n\nThe Democratic activist wing has deceived itself for, now, a decade that America wants a Bernie Sanders–type government, and America does not. And the more they foist that kind of approach on their own party, the more they do harm to their own party. And look, I’m not a Democrat; I don’t have any stake in the Democratic Party as an institution. But at this juncture in history, if you’re worried about Donald Trump, the Democratic Party is the instrument by which Donald Trump can be opposed—the only effective instrument. So a lot of us who aren’t Democrats have an interest in the Democrats making wiser and better choices than that party has sometimes made. And making those wiser and better choices means not listening to people for whom the big prize is not winning elections and saving American democracy, but winning control of the Democratic Party and empowering themselves.\n\nAnd now my dialogue with Sarah Longwell. But first, a quick break.\n\nFrum: Sarah Longwell is a graduate of Kenyon College. She built a career as a Washington, D.C., communications expert on the Republican side, working first for others and then for herself. She became the first woman to become chair of the board of the Log Cabin Republicans, the premier gay-rights group within the Republican Party. And in that position, she was active in an important factional fight in the 2016 election, where she led the resistance within the Log Cabin Republicans to an endorsement of Donald Trump.\n\nTime passed, the factional fight only worsened, and Sarah found herself, in 2019, confronted with a majority of her colleagues who wanted to endorse the reelection of Donald Trump. And on that issue, she resigned from the Log Cabin Republicans and reinvented her life in a very brave way, signing up for a then-new project called The Bulwark, where she became publisher, and creating an army of Republican groups: Republicans [Voters] Against Trump, many similar organizations—you’ve seen their content. And she has discovered a role as one of the leaders of a new kind of media campaign in the Republican world, standing up for traditional Republican ideas about the rule of law, limited government, free trade while opposing the Trump presidency. And over that time, she has become a kind of central figure in the intellectual and community life of the small but proud group of anti-Trump Republicans, so it is a special pleasure to welcome Sarah to the show today.\n\nSarah, thank you for joining.\n\nSarah Longwell: Thanks, David. It’s great to see you. Thanks for having me.\n\nFrum: Okay, so I wanna ask you about a very specific thing that happened in the 2025 elections in Virginia and New Jersey and the city of New York, and then a series of less-headline elections: the Pennsylvania Supreme Court and Georgia Public Service Commission.\n\nNow, we have some exit-poll data on this, and I’m going to preface; I’m gonna take a minute—I know you have even deeper expertise on this—to warn listeners and viewers against exit-poll data that comes out immediately after an election. There are a lot of technical problems with early exit polls, but the core problem is this: Somebody approaches you with a clipboard after you voted. Who’s likely to linger and talk to them? Not someone with kids to pick up at day care. Not someone with a job demanding them. This is someone with a little time on their hands and maybe a little extra willingness to share their views. Is that person like the people who are picking kids up at day care, are hastening to a job, or just don’t wanna share their views with strangers? If the group willing to talk to exit pollsters is a different kind of group from the kind of people who don’t wanna talk to exit polls, well, there’s your problem right there.\n\nThen you have the problem of making sure, well, how many, for example—we’re going to be talking about this group—women should be in the sample. Women are 52 percent of the adult population. But you don’t know, on voting day, that women were 52 percent of the voting population, so you have to make a guess about how many women to include in your sample. And that goes for people over 65, people under 30, Blacks, whites, Latinos, Asians, people with certain income levels. You have to start with an implicit model of what the electorate looks like, which you don’t know, and then build your sample accordingly.\n\nSo, with all of those caveats, something enormous seems to have happened with the votes of women—and especially women under 30—on this voting day. And, Sarah, you are here to explain what happened, with all the caveats that we don’t have numbers that are as exact as some of the reporting suggests.\n\nLongwell: Yeah, your caveats are real and good, but I think that, even if there was a miss in some way with the exit polling, it would be difficult for it to erase what is still a seismic overperformance of all of these Democratic candidates with women under 30. They all overperformed with men under 30 as well.\n\nBut just to take the three key races that we focused on last Tuesday, which is the Virginia gubernatorial race, the New Jersey gubernatorial race, and then the New York City mayoral race: In Virginia, where it was Abigail Spanberger up against Winsome Earle-Sears, who was the Republican, Abigail Spanberger was +17 with men under 30, but she was +64 with women under 30. And then it is similar in New Jersey—and this is another thing that’s interesting about this, is that the results are so similar to each other that you do have to think, at least trend-wise, they’ve got it right. And so in New Jersey, for men under 30, [Mikie] Sherrill was +17, but for women under 30, Sherrill was +62. That means that 81 percent of young women under 30, 81 percent, voted for Mikie Sherrill. Eighty-two percent of young women under 30 voted for Abigail Spanberger. And then you get to Mamdani, where men under 30 went 65 percent for Mamdani—and actually, New York is the one place where men slightly went more for Mamdani than in the other two races, where women overall went more for Sherrill and Spanberger. But still, women under 30 were 82 percent for Mamdani.\n\nSo those three races taken together, you have women under 30 where 81, 82 percent of them are voting for the Democratic candidate. That is a massive margin and really different from the gender breakdown, the gender split, for their older cohorts. So among men and women who are 65-plus, the gender divide is almost nonexistent. But as you get younger, the gender divide opens up into a chasm, and I think Democrats are feeling pretty good about the fact that they still overperformed with men relative to how they did in 2024, but with women, it’s just not even close. It’s like a total ownership by the Democratic Party of this young cohort of women.\n\nFrum: Okay, before we go to the why, one more question about what: Do we have any information about Pennsylvania and Georgia?\n\nLongwell: We don’t, or at least I don’t, in part because those races—so here’s the thing: In the other three races, the reason that you can get pretty good exit polling is because they had enormous turnout relative to a presidential year. These were really big races. And so the relative turnout compared to 2024, in New Jersey, I believe they got about 77 percent of the way there; it was a little more in Virginia. And so those are big numbers, where you can draw pretty big conclusions from them. The turnout in these states where the races were not so big was nothing compared to what it is in a presidential year, and so it’s tough to draw too many conclusions.\n\nAnd I will say, one of the overarching things to understand—and I think that people do understand this more now; people get it. But just to put it all in context if this is something that does sound new to you—you’re like, Man, why this explosive difference in these off-year elections?—well, a large part of it is that there’s a trade that’s been going on over the last 10 or so years where a lot of college-educated, suburban voters who might have been Mitt Romney and John McCain voters have moved from the Republican Party into the Democratic Party. And that is good for Democrats in off-year elections because those are highly engaged, highly likely voters, and so they will vote in off-year elections, whereas Donald Trump got in the trade and Republicans got in the trade a lot more low-propensity voters.\n\nAnd so one of the things that I do think people are still coming to terms with is, for a long time, for Democrats, the higher the turnout, the better Democrats did because they had these low-propensity voters who didn’t turn out in off years, didn’t pay much attention to politics, but when it came time for a big national election, they would show up and say, I’m voting for the Democrat. Donald Trump has brought those people into the Republican Party, to the point where, in 2024, if there had been far more people voting, the likelihood of Donald Trump winning by a larger margin [might increase], which is just not how politics used to work, but that is the reality of the way that Donald Trump has reshaped the Republican Party. Many more of these low-propensity voters are now part of the Republican Party. And many of them are men, which is another key piece of this story because women, like these Democratic voters, are much more likely to be hyper-engaged and to show up and be responsible about voting, including in off-year elections, where a lot of these younger men, who have kind of been red-pilled into the Republican Party, they are much more marginal voters. They are not the people you can rely on in an off-year election to the same degree. I think that’s a big part of what we’re seeing coming out of last Tuesday.\n\nFrum: I wanna pin that and double back to it, but before we double back to it—and I really do wanna double back to that point, very much—this is a problem of relativity. When you see two groups drifting apart, the question is: Are they both moving? Is one staying still and the other moving, or vice versa? So as we see this increasing gap between the way women under 30 and men under 30 vote, who’s changing more?\n\nLongwell: I think, well, society—all of us—all around us, there are big changes taking place. I do think that it is—women are changing more in the sense that, over time, women have become more educated. They tend to be statistically more—have more higher education than their male counterparts. They are, like I said, more sort of hyper-engaged in politics, whereas men, I think, are a little more red-pilled, a little more in the—\n\nFrum: What do you mean? Explain what you mean by “red-pilled.”\n\nLongwell: Yeah, so “red-pilled” is sort of two things. One is a rejection of kind of Democratic elite culture. So I think that men have been moving increasingly away from—\n\nFrum: Let me pause you. “Red pill” is a reference to the movie The Matrix.\n\nLongwell: Yes, sorry. You gotta go really far back to understand what “red-pilled,” “black-pilled” [comes from], but it’s essentially the idea that you get—well, actually, I don’t even explain it in the context of The Matrix; I explain it in the context of politics, which is a rejection of “woke,” DEI, and Democratic politics in general.\n\nFrum: In The Matrix, there’s an offer of two pills, one which allows you to live in the world of comforting illusions, which is blue, and one of which is red, which allows you to see the horrible truth. And so when Alex Jones wants you to know that aliens are real and killed [John F. Kennedy], and Nancy Pelosi has been covering it up all this time because she’s a face-eating pedophile who drinks blood, that is called “red-pilling” because as lunatic and crazy and false in every particular, big and small, as it is, the people who absorb that red pill believe it’s true: The aliens did kill JFK, and Nancy Pelosi has been covering it up. And people, but especially men, who subscribe to these crazy things you hear on the internet don’t say, I’m a lunatic—which is true—or I trust and listen to lunatics and give them my money and buy their supplements. No, no, I have taken Morpheus’s red pill, and now I see the truth about the aliens killing JFK.\n\nLongwell: That’s a way better explanation of what the actual act of taking a red pill is in the world. It is more like men saying, Man, I don’t think that there’s anything in what the Democrats are offering that resonates with me, and I reject it actively. In fact, it makes me angry. And this, I think, goes to the central point of the why about younger men and women. They live in algorithmically different universes, and that is pushing them to both not really understand each other, not be able to talk to each other.\n\nThere’s a whole bunch of other things going on. Some of it is just COVID, right? Part of the red-pill culture is about the idea that the way that elites approached COVID and demanded that they live inside and wear masks—and that they were wrong about that, and it destroyed people’s lives, and so Democrats are to blame. And so you’ve got this sort of young-man culture that is both angry at elites, angry at woke culture, and also, in many ways, hostile to women.\n\nFrum: Because to go back to your other comparison, the people over 65, mostly, they’re men and women living together and, especially with nonnational elections, they’re talking to each other over breakfast. Like, “Well, this candidate for governor wants to widen the highway.” “Well, gee, that means we can get to work faster.” “Yes, but it’ll be more traffic on our road.” “Oh, I hadn’t thought of that. But getting to work faster, that would be good.” “Okay, so let’s vote for the candidate who’s going to widen the road, not the one—” and they converge because they’re talking to each other, especially about those bread-and-butter issues that are so prominent in local elections. You want the bars downtown to stay open from two to four—more revenue from merchants, a livelier street life. On the other hand, more mess, more risk of crime. The husband and wife over 65, they talk about those things. Whereas when you have young men and young women who not only don’t live together, but don’t consume the same media, don’t get the same algorithmic feeds, as you say, they’re not talking and therefore not converging.\n\nLongwell: That’s a hundred percent the case. I did this episode on The Focus Group podcast, which is the weekly podcast I do where we listen to voters, but this week, we listened to young voters, and I had a sort of a Gen Z qualitative analyst on who was talking to me about what was going on with men and women. And one of the things she said to me that makes a ton of sense is not only are young people growing up very native to screens, to social media, and to these algorithmic impulses that push them into completely different worlds—’cause instead of saying, Okay, men and women, they might gravitate toward different things, but there’s also all this monoculture stuff that sort of brings them together, that they like to do together or where they have similar points of reference, and so they talk about it together, that much of that is disappearing, number one. And number two, COVID did a massive disruption for this younger generation that actually created for them an inability to even talk to each other in the normal ways, like flirting or figuring out how you just be together, like finding third spaces that aren’t in school or in a job where men and women come together and hang out.\n\nAnd one of the things we did for this group is we listened to a young group of progressive women, and it was interesting to hear them say, essentially, I don’t really need men. They are off doing this stupid video-game stuff, and they’re sort of emotionally immature or stunted in these ways. I get a great deal of my sort of nutrition, like emotional sustenance, from other women, and so I don’t need men. And they’re acting like big babies. And then you listen to the men, who say, Well, I wanna get married. I wanna have kids. Those are my priorities. And of course, them feeling like women don’t feel the same way or reject them then cause them to sort of turn inward and find community in these bro-y podcasting spaces, gaming spaces, many places that actually could be either actively hostile to women or where just sort of a rejection of women to create that camaraderie becomes [prevalent]. And so they’re getting actively pulled apart in this way that doesn’t just have political consequences, but I feel like it’s gonna have lasting cultural consequences if we kind of don’t figure out what’s happening with the kids.\n\nFrum: I’m interested by a word you haven’t said. ’Cause if we’re having this conversation about gender gaps, which began to show up in the 1980s. Before 1980, men and women voted almost exactly like each other and were defined by their group, so Black men and Black women;white men, white women; blue-collar men, blue-collar women; white-collar men, white-collar women. The sex divide was not an important divide before 1980. It begins to become an important divide in the 1980s, but especially among the young. Over the 45 years where we’ve been talking about this, the word that is always invoked first is the word abortion.\n\nLongwell: Abortion. Yeah, true—\n\nFrum: And you have not said that word at all.\n\nLongwell: Yeah. That is because I think that that matters, it’s in there, and in fact, when we were listening to the young women in the groups, that was something they brought up pretty quickly. They did. They are scared about the repeal of Roe v. Wade. They are in that age group where their friends are actively grappling with pregnancies—wanted, unwanted—reproductive health in general, thinking about IVF. All of the things that kind of run the gamut there, that’s the age where not only do you have to contend with it biologically and all of the scary things that come with it, but everybody in your orbit is dealing with this stuff.\n\nSo it certainly came up and mattered to them, but it was in with a bunch of other things too. They were much more likely, and this is where the algorithm—and algorithms are difficult. And actually, this is where you get back to sort of the red-pill/blue-pill-type situation is, like, “What does a person see? What world do they live in?” And one of the big differences between people who are older and people who are younger is not just what types of media they consume, but how they consume it.\n\nSo older people are what we would call news seekers, right? Even people my age, people your age, we would watch the news. (Laughs.) It was an act. We would go sit down with our cup of coffee in the morning; we’d watch the news. Or we’d pick up the newspaper; we’d read the news. And obviously, that’s been shifting for a while. But we still have a news-seeker mentality: I’m gonna get on; I’m gonna look at what’s going on in the news.\n\nYoung people are news receivers almost exclusively. The algorithm just gives them their news; it washes over them. And so the algorithm is saying, Oh, young women, I’m gonna push more pro-Palestinian stuff your way. I’m gonna push more reproductive-rights stuff your way. I’m gonna push more affordability things your way, whatever it is—young women are just living in a different information environment than the men that they’re around. And so, yes, it’s abortion. I think that that really does matter. I think something bigger is happening than just reproductive rights.\n\nFrum: How much of this is just behavioral? So Mitt Romney faced a gender gap because many women disagreed with his views not just on personal autonomy, reproductive health, things like that, but also Mitt Romney, you were going to get lower taxes for fewer services. But I venture that, if you’d ask the typical American middle-aged woman, you said, “If your daughter brought home a man like the young Mitt Romney, would you wanna see her marry him?” “Oh, yeah.” (Laughs.) “Yeah, he’d be a great husband. I may not vote for him for president, but, yeah, my daughter brought him home? Yeah.”\n\nOkay, so Donald Trump, you’d call the cops, right? I mean, this guy… (Laughs.) You’d get a restraining order. And, well, I was about to say, “He’s the biggest jerk in the world.” Actually, you know what, maybe he was in 2016, but he has been so far overtaken by bigger and bigger jerks who have been licensed by him, and we live in, like, the golden age of jerks. And so much of the world that we have seen since 2020, the informational world, is one in which the content produced for men teaches, invites, validates the worst kind of behavior. And I wonder if that’s kind of—that women just say, I want no part of this.\n\nLongwell: Well, so I actually don’t quite know the answer to this, but I’m gonna venture something. Because one of the things that’s been so interesting to me as I’ve listened to focus groups now for eight years around Trump, I went back recently and looked at some of my 2018 focus groups among women—I’m talking about, like, 50-year-old women, 60-year-old women—and they have this sort of strong/weak frame they’re grappling with. They have been dealing with Donald Trump in their lives for forever, right? He was around, he was a playboy, he’s on Page Six, and then he was on The Apprentice, this carefully curated businessman. And I would say, older women, the locker-room talk landed with them. They kind of understood that. And obviously, there has been a disparity with women, but overall, he does okay. The bottom hasn’t completely dropped out with women.\n\nFor younger women, it is not just Trump, but it is the forces Trump has unleashed on the young men around them that they have to deal with, that they have to listen [to]. Imagine not just having Trump’s sort of “Grab her by the” stuff in the ether, but now Andrew Tate and Matt Walsh and the tradwives and all this stuff you see permeating the culture among young men, and you have the ability—in ways that, I think, women many, many decades older than you might not have, right, because they were conditioned more to, like, deal with it. Young women are like, I don’t need to deal with this. Listening to the progressive women, they were just like, Getting married, having kids is not my No. 1 priority, and if these guys are gonna act like this, I don’t have to hang with that.\n\nFrum: I don’t have to imagine it, because I have a daughter in the relevant dating pool. And I hear—her mother hears more, obviously, but… (Laughs.) But I hear some, and it does seem like—I don’t know what’s going on in the entire universe, but in the universe of college-educated, career-minded young men, the behavior seems to be a lot worse than it was when I was in that group.\n\nLongwell: Well, I think part of it is: How do you behave if your incentives are to come together, right, if the cultural incentives are to find a way to—men need women; women need men. We are finding ways to take the fact that there’s these real differences, but there’s things that pull them together and make them wanna cohabitate and live in the world together, in a way where those incentives are just sort of falling away. And it’s the reason that—part of the rise of the tradwife and men talking about repealing the Nineteenth Amendment, it comes from a sense of, Women are not as reliant on us anymore. That freaks us out, and also, I do think, is genuinely displacing, right? This idea of, I don’t know what my role in society is if women’s role in society is this, and so I’m gonna be angry about it.\n\nAnd I don’t wanna overstate it. And the young woman that I was interviewing from Gen Z also was sort of careful to be like, And, hey, look, we’re still out here dating. We’re still out here living our lives. But just in terms of big, macro cultural forces, I do think the things that divide the sexes and the incentives have shifted quite a bit and are pushing people apart more than they’re pushing them together.\n\nFrum: Yeah. Now, I pinned something a little while ago, and I wanna come back to this, about what is happening. And maybe a way back into this thing we wanted to pin was to talk about what happened in New York City, because Mamdani did do well with young men. I have my own private theory about that, but I’d be interested to know, is the difference here—and this goes back to the thing we wanted to talk about before—is that women are voting for women? Because, remember, the places where we saw these huge gender gaps were female candidates—although, in Virginia, it was a female candidate against another female candidate. In New Jersey, female candidate against a male candidate. In New York, the candidate was male. Is that why young men were more attracted to Mamdani, or was it that Mamdani did come more from a very male-oriented media subculture? And he also—I’m gonna try to put this as neutrally as I can—but he had engaged in and celebrated a lot of norm-defying behavior.\n\nLongwell: Yeah, I think that, partly, it’s tough to extrapolate. You can extrapolate a lot more about national politics out of New Jersey and Virginia than you can out of New York City. New York City is really its own kind of beast with its own kind of—like, the people who voted for Cuomo, it’s hard to know whether they’re kind of Trumpy Republicans, all the way over to sort of normie Democrats, to Jews who didn’t like Mamdani. It’s actually a very difficult thing to tease apart or extrapolate from New York City what’s going on in national politics.\n\nJust in terms of men versus women, the women-under-30 margin was basically exactly the same as it was in the other two races, which was that it was 82 percent women under 30 went for Mamdani, but 65 percent of men under 30 went for Mamdani, which is higher than the other two races. And it was a very high turnout. The thing is, turnout is such an important part of trying to carve up how many people did what in an election, and there’s just a ton of New York Democrats. But I do think that Mamdani appealed to men in part because he is a man, in part because he did more—he was very much in the sort of, yeah, male algorithmic ecosystem. But I do think some of it just has to do with, yeah, him being a guy.\n\nThis is a difficult thing to tease out in focus groups ’cause people don’t like admitting it, but people do talk about the fact that they don’t wanna vote for women.\n\nFrum: Yeah. No, really, they do. Yeah, they will say that.\n\nLongwell: They do, much more for president than for these local elections. And people will articulate this, women too, where they’ll say, I’m happy to vote for a woman for Senate, whatever, but when it comes to—and a lot of it has to do with dealing with world leaders. But people, often, in focus groups—and not just often, almost dominantly—they put things in strong-and-weak framing. And one of the things they say about Donald Trump is that he’s strong, and Kamala Harris seemed weak, but also, Joe Biden seemed weak.\n\nAnd I think that there’s something about Mamdani—young, handsome, lots of energy—that lends itself to the strong framing that does allow, it’s not everyone, but does allow some men to just tag on in ways that they feel funny about voting for women. I think it does make up a little bit of margin.\n\nFrum: You think people are more willing to say in a focus group, I wouldn’t vote for a woman, than they were 15 years ago?\n\nLongwell: I do. Hundred percent. The thing is, I wasn’t doing focus groups back then, but I gotta say, in my life—and I was a Republican, so I was around lots of people with Republican ideas—I never heard anybody say, I wouldn’t vote for a woman—\n\nFrum: They might think it.\n\nLongwell: They might think it, sure. But honestly, people—especially for Republicans, there was always a sense of, It would be great to have more women candidates. For such a long time, it was a real sense of, We need to get more women in because that’s how we’re competitive. Women vote at these higher numbers. Everybody sort of knew that.\n\nDonald Trump came along, and now both men and women are much more willing, and a lot of them older, to just say—I’ve had people, men—I remember it vividly, so it can’t happen so much that it doesn’t leave an impression. But he was like, Well, what if they’re on their period? Who knows what kind of decision they might make? And so you do hear more of that kind of stuff.\n\nFrum: I think, with men voters of a certain age, there was also the [Margaret] Thatcher example. So the first female leader of a G7 country was someone who was unquestionably strong and on the right. And so I think that led a lot of people in the Republican world in the ’80s and ’90s to assume the first female president will probably be a Republican in the Thatcher model because that may answer the strong—I mean, no one would ever say—\n\nLongwell: I thought that. That was always my thinking, that the first female president would be a Republican. I think if Condoleezza Rice had run—and this is where people are like, Well, no, America’s never gonna vote for a Black woman. I’m convinced that if Condoleezza Rice had run—also, I’m convinced that if Michelle Obama had run this last time—I think she would’ve won. I think that Republicans would’ve voted for her. I think that some Democrats would’ve voted for her. But there aren’t a lot of women now in the Thatcher model. (Laughs.)\n\nDonald Trump is actually—he’s managed to, in a weird way—there are a lot of women, a lot of high-profile women, in the Republican Party. There’s Marjorie Taylor Greene. There’s Elise Stefanik. There’s Kristi Noem. He surrounds himself with lots of women—Pam Bondi. So in some ways, and people don’t really write this story that much, but he has lots of women in his orbit, maybe more than any president I can remember. The problem is, is that they’re all deeply subservient to Donald Trump, right? They’re all in his image. And so he likes that. He likes that there’s all these women who are willing to kind of just subsume themselves into Donald Trump’s image. Even that was part of the problem for Winsome Earle-Sears, right? They’re all these, like, MAGA weirdo candidates, and none of them are in the Thatcher model at all, right? They sort of don’t stand alone.\n\nAnd to the extent that Nikki Haley—she could never recover from the way in which she had allowed herself to be totally sort of humiliated over and over by Donald Trump and made to look a fool. She actually was on the trajectory of that Thatcherite model: somebody who was deeply invested in foreign policy or had high level of expertise in that. But nobody sees her as strong, the way they don’t see a lot of these women as strong, because they’re just Trump-lite, so everybody can see that they’re this simulacrum of Donald Trump.\n\nFrum: I wanna go back now to something—a point I, again, I bracketed a little while ago. Are we looking at sort of an education gap because women are so much more successful at getting university and post-university education than men, that that’s another thing that is going on here?\n\nLongwell: Yeah, the diploma divide is essential to understand. If there’s two things in politics—and I wouldn’t even put the gender divide as the top one; I would put the diploma divide at the top because I think it’s driving a big part of the gender divide. And then it would be the political realignment that has happened with Donald Trump, to the extent where—and, again, meaning that there’s been this trade, the trade of noncollege, working-class voters have moved to the Republican Party. The average voter in this country is a 50-year-old white person without a college degree. But in places where there is a high concentration of college degrees, they tend to be more liberal. And most importantly, and this is what really matters for 2026, is that it is the off-year elections where Democrats now have the advantage because they have more college-educated voters, and many of them are like me—they are people who used to vote for Republicans—and Republicans used to benefit from having people like me in the off year. In the off years, we would show up, and so Republicans had the chance to do really well in off years. That is no longer true. This is the biggest flip in politics, structurally, which is that, in off years, Democrats now have the opportunity to do better because they have more college-educated voters.\n\nAnd I would hazard to take that a step further, then, and say, to your point, to bring it back: Because young women—and women in general—are now much more likely to have a B.A., to be college educated, and to be tapped in on these political issues in off years, they are now becoming enormous driving forces in who wins in off-year elections, which is why you’re seeing these extremely enormous margins, right? Because in the makeup of who voted, young women are making up quite a large percentage of who is turning out to vote, so they are gonna become a key constituency, and that young men—much like noncollege, working-class voters—are people who maybe just turn out in big national elections and just pay attention to big national vibes, but aren’t as keyed in on all this other stuff that young women seem to be very keyed in on.\n\nFrum: If you were to give each party some advice about how it can overcome its deficiencies, not grand strategic advice, but just say, okay, if you’re a Republican running for senator, governor in ’26, and you’re worried about how you do with women, what should you do? And if you’re a Democrat worried about how you’re doing with men in ’26, what should you do?\n\nLongwell: Well, if you wanna do better with women, you should reject Donald Trump. The extent to which Trump is driving—a rejection of Trump—and that shouldn’t be underestimated in these numbers, either. Just the way that young men have gravitated more toward Donald Trump, young women are repelled by him.\n\nAnd this is a bigger question. Trump’s lame-duckness really came into focus after these first off-year elections. They’re going to come further into focus after the 2026 elections, where people will start saying, Okay, who is gonna be the Republican nominee in 2028? And I think that, going into ’26, the extent to which Trump is still, though—rejection of him—is a driving force in Democratic politics, I think that that’s the No. 1 thing: Young women don’t wanna have anything to do with Donald Trump.\n\nIf you were gonna bring young men in, if you wanna do more with young men, go on all the podcasts. This is what Trump did. This is what [J. D.] Vance is doing. Vance’s job is basically to go on bro podcasts and keep the Trump agenda top of mind for them.\n\nFrum: Yeah. That’s one of his vulnerabilities when you say, Who succeeds Donald Trump? I bet it’s pretty unlikely that J. D. Vance ever said, Let’s repeal the Nineteenth Amendment, the amendment that gives women the vote, but I bet there’s a clip of him chuckling when somebody else said it.\n\nLongwell: Yeah, well, there’s definitely clips of him talking about “childless cat ladies” being the biggest problem. J. D. Vance is a very good archetype of the kind of low-level hostility to women and, especially, sort of memeification of jokes about progressive women. And so the intensity of the rejection of J. D. Vance from young women will be hard, and that will further accelerate that gender divide because I do think that Vance has something that a lot of young men—I know this for a fact; I listen to young men talk about it—they like him. They find him to be a more intellectual version of Donald Trump, somebody slightly more serious, and also somebody who is young like them, just like Mamdani is a young man like them.\n\nFrum: Yeah. So you think that that works? Because he’s awfully eggheady.\n\nLongwell: I don’t think it works the way Trump works. I think the reason that you see them cosplaying around the Trump 2028 is that they recognize this phenomenon that I have now discussed at length of: Trump draws out low-propensity voters in a way Republicans have never seen for their party. And they do not know if that continues to happen with J. D. Vance, because Donald Trump is such a unique figure, and if, suddenly, without Trump’s general election ability to put up Saddam Hussein–like numbers in a lot of rural areas and other places, if that’s left to J. D. Vance and they can’t get that, but these college-educated, suburban voters have now shifted to the Democrats, that spells long-term trouble for Republicans.\n\nFrum: Last thought on this, for what it means for the shape of local politics. Because one of the [things] you have left behind, there’s a big question mark about 2028, but your suggestion is that, if it’s about propensity, that state government should become more and more—what is the word I’m looking for—more and more aligned with the interests of younger women. I don’t wanna use the word liberal or progressive, because I’m not sure that that’s exactly what’s going on. But the way that those people who are, today, under 30 and very soon will be under 40 think, it should drive more and more of the way the local government behaves.\n\nLocal government, since the elections of 2010, has moved so far to the right. Republicans had a big year in 2010; there were the redistrictings. And we’ve had very conservative local governments almost everywhere from 2010, and with the consequence, effects of the way state maps are drawn, when you have a very conservative Wisconsin state legislature, you’ve got a very gerrymandered Wisconsin congressional delegation, same thing in North Carolina. But if it becomes harder for Republicans to win in Wisconsin and North Carolina at the state level, how does that ramify through the whole federal political system?\n\nLongwell: Look, I’ve always thought that the only way to get our politics to return to normal is for Republicans to endure sustained electoral defeats—which is not what’s been happening, right? We keep having “change” elections, swinging back and forth. Republicans have more confidence that they can continue in this Trumpy direction and compete electorally.\n\nPart of me doesn’t wanna overemphasize sort of the demographic of young people growing up and then our politics staying the same, because I think the Democrats thought that that would happen because of demographics and because of young people, and that didn’t happen. I do think what might happen long term is that the parties start to become really gender divided, that Republicans basically say, I don’t think we can compete—which is what they’re doing right now. They’re saying, I can’t and won’t even try to compete with young women. Instead, we’re gonna focus on competing more with young men, and that includes margins of Black men and Hispanic men that help us sort of recover those numbers. And because, like I said, the average voter is a 50-year-old noncollege white voter, and there’s a lot of them, they can still do really well, but they have to start losing in places like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin.\n\nAnd in fact, I’ll tell you something else that worries me, is that there’s gonna be a census in 2030 that I think is gonna tilt things even further in favor of Republicans. It is getting very hard because these concentrations of young, college-educated women, they’re not as concentrated in Ohio; they’re not as concentrated in Florida, in places where Democrats used to be competitive and no longer are. And so the Senate map is increasingly hostile to Democrats, and Democrats are gonna have to figure out how to compete in places that they used to be able to compete in, right, when Heidi Heitkamp was around or lots of people who—they could compete in Iowa. And they’re gonna have to do that again.\n\nFrum: Sarah, thank you so much for your time today. It’s such a pleasure to talk to you always. I always learn from you.\n\nLongwell: Oh, thanks for having me, David.\n\nFrum: Bye-bye.\n\nFrum: Thanks so much to Sarah Longwell for joining me today on The David Frum Show. As I mentioned at the top, my book this week is a new novel, The Emergency, by my Atlantic colleague George Packer. Now, some of you who listen to or watch this podcast may remember a dialogue that George Packer and I shared together about his very incisive profile of J. D. Vance earlier this year.\n\nGeorge Packer is the author of important works of nonfiction: a 2005 study of the war in Iraq, The Assassins’ Gate, based on his really empathetic and very courageous war reporting from the Iraq front. He wrote, in 2013, a stylistically original study of the Great Recession called The Unwinding, which mixed broad economic reporting with a series of very elegant and interior profiles of people, both famous and not, who had been caught up in the drama and tragedy of the events of the Great Recession. He is the author, in 2019, of a biography of Richard Holbrooke, the great American diplomat, called Our Man.\n\nBut George, through his career, has been ambidextrous—fiction and nonfiction—and this new novel of his, The Emergency, marks a return to his career as a writer of fiction. I read it in an earlier form. It made an enormous impression on me; it’s one of those novels I found myself dreaming about. And as I thought about why it had made such an impact on me, it led me to a thought that George wants to invite, a thought he contributed a recent article to The Atlantic about, which is: What is fiction for, exactly?\n\nNow, I am mostly a writer of nonfiction. I’ve tried my hand at fiction; it was not of the level of artistic excellence of George’s work. When you write nonfiction, you’re constantly trying to explain to people both how the world is and to prove that you have a right to talk about it. You have devices to substantiate your claims to credibility—facts and figures, quotes, public-opinion polling—that you’re trying to persuade people, Look, I’m going to tell you what the world is like, and here’s how you can know that I am right about what the world is like, and this is why you should believe me.\n\nWith fiction, you jettison that apparatus. What you do in the work of fiction is say to the reader, I’m going to show you something. I believe it’s true. You don’t have to believe it. We’re saying it’s mostly made up, or it’s imagined. But I’m gonna show you something, and you tell me if you agree that I have shown you a truth that you recognize, even though there are no facts and figures to back it up.\n\nAnd that, I think, is what George has done in The Emergency. Here, he conjures up a world that is like and unlike our own. It is a world in which an old order has collapsed, in which young people are imposing new structures of identity and conformity on the old, in which the old feel left out, and in which many people are turning to devices that substitute for reality, that offer them a more attractive experience than reality. So that sounds like a world we know. But in many respects, it’s not the world we know. It doesn’t take place in the United States of America. It doesn’t take place in any country that actually exists. It takes place in a fictional fallen empire. It doesn’t take place exactly in our time. The world of The Emergency‚ well, they do have cars. They have firearms. They have surgical suites. But it doesn’t feel quite modern. It feels like the world of the 1970s or maybe the 1960s. It doesn’t have an economy that works quite like ours. It doesn’t have groups that conform to our idea of what the groups in society are. It’s like and unlike.And one thing that is also very important is, although it is a world that doesn’t exist, it’s a world that doesn’t have fantastic elements of magic or technology. There are no spaceships, and there are no wizards and warlocks, no magic spells, no incantations. The laws of physics in George Packer’s universe are exactly the same as the laws of physics in our universe—no abracadabras. And the people are very like people you know, and they operate and talk in ways that feel very familiar, even if they do so in a context that is—well, that’s the big question mark, is, in some ways, the context is familiar. Many of us have a feeling that we live in a world that is not the world we expected to live in, a world that is somehow falling away from a better world that existed until quite recently, a world that disappoints many of our expectations and hopes, and a world in which we have to make the best of things that we thought we would never encounter in the first place.\n\nSo in that sense, it’s strange, but it’s not so strange. And in fact, one of the things that I think George is doing in this book is he’s making our present-day world more intelligible by making it more strange, by abstracting. There’s no Donald Trump. There’s no Congress of the United States. There are no midterm elections. TIt’s not even clear that there’s no internet in the novel. It’s not even clear that this is a world in which the people involved are really speaking English; although the novel is recorded in English, it’s quite possible this is some other kind of language entirely, which just happens to be reported to us in English. But it’s a world in which we’re going to feel that a lot of our fears and doubts are reflected in ways that make them easier to grasp and easier to understand, but with no claims made that this is how reality is. If you don’t wanna believe it, you don’t have to. There are no opinion polls here, no surveys, no facts and figures.\n\nAs I said, it is the kind of book that I found myself literally dreaming about. I woke up one night, and I felt I had been living for that evening in the world of The Emergency, a world in which sometimes it seems that we are living among fragments of a ruined society. And that the challenge for each of us is to figure out: How do we reconnect with people who have been estranged from us by the ruin of the old society and make something new that maybe won’t be quite as good as what went before, maybe represents a degree of loss, but doesn’t have to be as bad as it otherwise might be?\n\nIt’s a novel, in many ways, of grief and disappearance and decline. But that kind of experience can also summon us to awareness of new possibilities—maybe not for everybody, but for ourselves—and new challenges to us to do right things under difficult circumstances rather than slide into the temptation to do wrong things.\n\nI highly recommend the book. I am so pleased to have been one of the early readers of it, and I think you will find it as moving and as disturbing as I did.\n\nThat’s it for The David Frum Show this week.

Kennedy, is running for Congress.\n\nSchlossberg, 32, entered the race for New York’s open 12th District, joining a crowded primary to succeed retiring Rep. Jerrold Nadler. The Democratic primary, which will be the deciding contest next year in a deep-blue district that supported Kamala Harris by more than 60 points last year, is set for June. \n\n“We can do better, and it starts with the Democratic Party winning back control of the House of Representatives,” Schlossberg said in a video posted to social media announcing his run. \n\n“I’m not running because I have all the answers to our problems. I’m running because the people of New York 12 do,” he added. \n\nSchlossberg, whose mother, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, has served as U.S. ambassador to Japan and Australia, is the latest scion of the storied Democratic family to enter politics. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., his first cousin once removed, ran for president last year before suspending his campaign to endorse Donald Trump. He joined the Trump administration this year as Health and Human Services secretary, and Schlossberg has publicly criticized him in recent months.\n\nMost recently on Capitol Hill, Schlossberg’s cousin Joseph P. Kennedy III served four terms in the House before unsuccessfully challenging Massachusetts Sen. Edward J. Markey in a 2020 Democratic primary. \n\nA graduate of Yale with master’s and law degrees from Harvard, Schlossberg spoke at the 2024 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. In addition to being a prolific presence on social media, he also wrote articles for Vogue last year as a political correspondent. \n\nSchlossberg’s announcement comes a week after Democrat Zohran Mamdani triumphed in the New York City mayor’s race, and Schlossberg told The New York Times in an interview published Tuesday that he saw Mamdani’s win as a positive sign for his campaign. Schlossberg endorsed the state assemblyman’s insurgent bid for the Democratic mayoral nomination in June. \n\nA busy Democratic primary is already shaping up in the 12th District, which includes Midtown Manhattan and the Upper West and East sides. State Assemblymen Micah Lasher, a former aide to Nadler, and Alex Bores have both already launched campaigns for the seat. Bores announced an endorsement Wednesday from former New York Rep.

Jerry Nadler’s House seat in a video statement posted to social media, saying that America is at “a turning point.” He added that “there’s nothing” the Democratic Party “can’t do” if it is able to regain control of Congress in the 2026 midterm elections. (RELATED: JFK’s Grandson Jack Schlossberg Posts Unhinged Video Mocking Melania Trump)\n\n“This is the best part of the greatest city on Earth,” Schlossberg said in the video announcement. “We have the best hospitals and schools, restaurants and museums. This is the financial and media capital of the world. This district should have a representative who can harness the creativity, energy and drive of this district and translate that into political power in Washington.”\n\nWhen reached for comment, Schlossberg’s campaign referred the Daily Caller News Foundation to a press release announcing his candidacy.\n\nIn his video statement, Schlossberg added that he is not running for Congress because he has “all the answers” to New Yorkers’ “problems.”\n\n“I’m not running because I have all the answers to our problems,” he said. “I’m running because the people of New York 12 do. I want to listen to your struggles, hear your stories, amplify your voice, go to Washington and execute on your behalf.”\n\nSchlossberg’s campaign launch comes after he said in a Sept. 7 X post that he had formed an “exploratory committee” for a potential congressional run.\n\nHowever, Caroline Kennedy, Schlossberg’s mother, is now “living in fear” that his bid for Congress may make him “a target for violent haters,” the New York Post report noted on Wednesday, citing anonymous sources.\n\n“Caroline has pleaded with Jack not to run, but he seems determined to follow in the political footsteps of his grandfather and generations of other Kennedys who have held political office,” one anonymous source told the Post.\n\nKennedy could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nAhead of the 2024 presidential election, Schlossberg served as a political correspondent for Vogue. He referred to himself as a “fun, wacky guy” and “a silly goose who’s trying, just trying, to get the truth out there” in a July 2024 interview with the fashion magazine.\n\nThe Kennedy heir has become well-known for his controversial social media posts, including satirical political content and shirtless videos of himself he’s shared in the past.\n\nAdditionally, Schlossberg previously served as a campaign surrogate for both former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris. He’s a graduate of Yale, Harvard Law School and Harvard Business School, and he spoke at the 2024 Democratic National Convention.\n\nSchlossberg has made headlines for publicly criticizing his cousin, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., in recent years.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

For the next few weeks, they’ll be preoccupied with finger-pointing and nasty recriminations — with the radical left blaming the middle-left, the middle-left blaming the radical left, and every other donkey ducking for cover.\n\nSo the timing is perfect: Trump should strike while the metal is smoldering.\n\nAnd for his next PR move, he should demand a constitutional amendment to end gerrymandering once and for all.\n\nGerrymandering isn’t a new thing. It’s named after Elbridge Gerry, the fifth vice president of the United States. Before joining James Madison’s 1812 ticket, he was the governor of Massachusetts, where he approved oddly-shaped legislative districts, one of which resembled a salamander.\n\nHence the name, “gerrymandering.”\n\nSo, good policy or not, U.S. politicians have been gerrymandering districts for over 200 years. It’s an American tradition — even older than the Star-Spangled Banner, baseball, Coca-Cola, and Levi jeans.\n\nBut it’s NOT a good policy: It’s stupid, corrupt, and blatantly undemocratic. The entire point of gerrymandering is to take a wrecking ball to statewide proportional representation, undermining the will of the people for partisan gain.\n\nAnd besides, the Democrats are way better at it than we are.\n\nOf course, they’ve also had more practice: Some of the most outlandishly gerrymandered districts are in bright-blue states, with GOP representation either 100% eliminated or diluted far below the Republican voting percentage:\n\nMassachusetts: 36% Republican, 0 Republican seatsConnecticut: 42% Republican, 0 Republican seatsMaine: 46% Republican, 0 Republican seatsNew Hampshire: 48% Republican, 0 Republican seatsNew Mexico: 46% Republican, 0 Republican seatsRhode Island: 42% Republican, 0 Republican seatsVermont: 32% Republican, 0 Republican seatsHawaii: 38% Republican, 0 Republican seatsDelaware: 42% Republican, 0 Republican seatsCalifornia: 38.3% Republican, only 9 of 52 seats Republican (17.3%)Illinois: 43.5% Republican, only 3 of 17 seats Republican (17.6%)Oregon: 41% Republican, only 1 of 6 seats Republican (16.7%)Maryland: 34& Republican, only 1 of 8 seats Republican (12.5%)New Jersey: 46% Republican, only 3 of 12 seats Republican (25%)New York: 43.3% Republican, only 7 of 26 seats Republican (26.9%)\n\nTo wrap your heads around the extent of the Democrats’ gerrymandering, consider: Kamala Harris won just 42.4% of the Texas vote in 2024 — a state with two Republican senators, a Republican governor, and that hasn’t gone Democratic in a presidential election in 50 years.\n\nBut right now, 34% of Texas’ congressional seats are still controlled by the Democrats.\n\nMeanwhile, Donald Trump won 43.5% of the vote in Illinois — a higher percentage than Harris won in Texas — yet just 17.6% of Illinois congressional seats are controlled by Republicans!\n\nSo how can Gov. JB Pritzker (D-Ill.) claim that Trump is “cheating Americans out of their votes” with Texas’ redistricting… when Illinois is nearly TWICE as gerrymandered as Texas?!\n\nThe whole thing is a mess. It’s bad public policy.\n\nAnd it gives President Trump an amazing PR opportunity: He can be the “grownup in the room,” drawing attention to the ridiculous degree of Democratic gerrymandering and positioning himself — and his fellow Republicans — as bipartisan, pro-American, pragmatic problem-solvers.\n\nStep One: Trump should make a national, primetime address.\n\n(I don’t know why Trump isn’t more proactive with national addresses. One of his strengths is as a communicator.)\n\nExplain to the American people that gerrymandering has been around for a very long time, and until recently, the Republican Party has mostly ignored it. Use easy-to-follow statistics and visuals to demonstrate the extent of the Democrats’ gerrymandering.\n\n(Hell, show ‘em the aforementioned state stats!)\n\nIn plain, direct language, give 'em the facts: When Barack Obama won the presidency in 2008, the Democrats won 52.9% of the votes in House elections… which somehow led to them controlling 59.1% of all the seats in the House of Representatives!\n\nGerrymandering subverts the will of the people. For all the talk of “Democracy dies in darkness,” what’s been going on in liberal states is blatantly undemocratic. This isn’t a government “of the people, by the people, for the people.”\n\nInstead, it’s politicians putting their fingers on the scales, disenfranchising voters, making a mockery of representative democracy.\n\nStep Two: Unapologetically explain that the GOP will fight fire with fire — but only because we have to.\n\nWe don’t have a choice: It would be utter insanity to turn a blind eye as the Democratic Party secures a permanent 25-seat “buffer” that insulates it from political fallout.\n\nIf it’s fair and reasonable for blue states to be so thoroughly gerrymandered that Republican representation is literally zero, then it’s fair for red states to play the same game.\n\nWhat’s good for the goose is good for the gander. (Or, for leftists, geese that identify as ganders. #loveislove)\n\nIn fact, I’d compare it to our crazy absentee voting laws: In an ideal world, everyone in America ought to vote on Election Day, but if states are gonna change the rules and allow all kinds of absentee voting, the GOP would be idiots if they didn’t participate, too.\n\nWe might not agree with the rules, but we’re obligated to follow ‘em.\n\nStep Three: Offer an offramp: A constitutional amendment to end gerrymandering once and for all.\n\nInstead of designing districts to protect D.C.’s career politicians, our #1 obligation ought to be the welfare of the people. It’s not fair to take a region full of farmers, but then carve it up into half a dozen congressional districts, simply because you don’t like how farmers vote. \n\nThat’s not democracy!\n\nBut that’s what the Democratic Party has been doing for centuries. Enough is enough. It’s gotten out of hand.\n\nDistricts ought to be designed to help the people, not the politicians.\n\nStep Four: Offer your hand to the Democratic Party: Join us in supporting a constitutional amendment. Let’s do this together!\n\nThey won’t TAKE the offer. Whatever Trump supports, they oppose.\n\nBut that’s fine, too: Let the Democrats argue in favor of partisan gerrymandering.\n\nForce 'em to remove their masks — and reveal to the American people their real, actual faces. Don’t let ’em continue the façade of “fighting fire with fire,” because that’s not what’s happening.\n\nEven if Texas redistricts, giving 5 more congressional seats to the GOP, the new ratio would be 30 Republicans, eight Democrats (leaving the Dems with 21% of the seats).\n\nMeanwhile, the CURRENT ratio in California is 43 Democrats, nine Republicans — leaving the GOP with just 17.3% of the seats! \n\nRelated: MoveOn.Org Demands Schumer’s Scalp: Welcome to the Dawn of the Democratic Putsch\n\nYet Gavin Newsom is threatening to gerrymander California even further:\n\nThis moment requires us to be prepared to fight fire with fire — and we won't hesitate to act if Texas Republicans move ahead with this ridiculous power grab. https://t.co/CvSkGceFur— Governor Gavin Newsom (@CAgovernor) July 30, 2025\n\nCalifornia is countering @realDonaldTrump's attempt to rig the 2026 election and redistrict his way out of accountability in states like Texas.We're fighting fire with fire — giving the power to the people to fight back and demand nationwide independent redistricting.— Governor Gavin Newsom (@CAgovernor) August 21, 2025\n\nThe benefit of this strategy is that it forces the Dems into a no-win position: They’ve either gotta defend gerrymandering — and acknowledge their culpability — or they’ve gotta bow their head to the president and join the GOP in following his lead.\n\nAnd at the same time, their 2028 frontrunner, the well-coifed California governor, Gavin “Slick Willy II” Newsom, is deprived of his casus belli and biggest issue: Gerrymandering California to “fight fire with fire” against Texas.\n\nInstead of Newsom being a “defender of democracy” — blocking the tyrannical overreach of “King” Donald Trump — he’ll look like just another partisan hack.\n\nWhereas Donald Trump is the grown-up in the room, seeking bipartisan, win-win, “America First” policies that improve the lives of the people.\n\nBecause gerrymandering IS a bipartisan boondoggle. Always has been. (And besides, with districts switching congressmen and rewriting districts every few years, businesses won’t even know who to bribe anymore: How will anything get done?!)\n\nSometimes, the best PR of all is simply doing the right thing.\n\nAnd ending the idiocy of gerrymandering is the right thing.

Kennedy Jr.’s cousin, Jack Schlossberg, has recently announced his decision to run for the congressional seat left behind by New York Representative Jerrold Nadler.\n\nSchlossberg, the 32-year-old grandson of former President John F. Kennedy, is a political commentator and writer who has been particularly critical of his cousin’s views and his decision to support President Donald Trump in the November election, as well as his position in the administration.\n\nNewsweek reached out to the Department of Health and Human Services via email for comment outside of regular working hours.\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nSchlossberg has garnered attention for his decision to run for a seat in Congress. His bid to bolster the Democratic Party’s power to counter Trump and his allies suggests his campaign could exacerbate tensions within the Kennedy family.\n\nThe 32-year-old’s campaign comes at a time when many in the Democratic Party have been calling on the younger generation to take on the political battle against the Trump administration. His announcement came a week after democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani, 34, was elected mayor of New York City.\n\nJack Schlossberg speaks at the Democratic National Convention on August 20, 2024, in Chicago.\n\nWhat To Know\n\nWhen Kennedy decided to enter the 2024 presidential race as an independent, Schlossberg deemed it an “embarrassment” and a “vanity project.”\n\n“I have no idea why anyone thinks he should be president,” Schlossberg said in a video on Instagram at the time, and made his endorsement of former President Joe Biden clear.\n\nHe also accused Kennedy of profiting from the family’s name for personal gain.\n\n“President John F. Kennedy is my grandfather and his legacy is important,” Schlossberg said. “It’s about a lot more than Camelot and conspiracy theories. It’s about public service and courage. It’s about civil rights, the Cuban missile crisis, and landing a man on the moon.”\n\nWhen Kennedy later dropped out of the race, throwing his support behind President Donald Trump, Schlossberg wrote in a post on X: “Never been less surprised in my life. Been saying it for over a year — RFK jr is for sale, works for Trump. Bedfellows and loving it. Kamala Harris is for the people — the easiest decision of all time just got easier.”\n\nKennedy’s support for Trump was divisive within the Kennedy family more broadly, as his siblings released a joint statement stating that his endorsement of Trump was a “betrayal of the values that our father and our family hold most dear.”\n\nSchlossberg has also directly criticized his cousin’s views on autism. In April this year, he shared a video on Instagram mocking Kennedy’s assertion that “toxins,” among other things, were driving autism rates in the country, despite most mainstream research determining genetics is its cause.\n\nIn the video, he said: “RFK Jr…I have a challenge for you. Me and you, one-on-one, locked in a room, we hash this out. Nobody comes out until one of us has autism.

He has restricted access by The Associated Press after its decision not to follow his lead in renaming the Gulf of Mexico, sued outlets like The New York Times and Wall Street Journal and stripped funding for public broadcasting because he doesn't like its news coverage.\n\nMuch like print reporters who search through notebooks for the perfect quote, video editors often labor to identify footage that will advance a story.\n\nSometimes the perfect image does not exist, or a quote isn't as succinct or sharp as a medium under constant time constraints demands. That can lead to the temptation to rearrange or even manipulate.\n\nNBC News got in trouble more than a decade ago for a story about George Zimmerman — who fatally shot Trayvon Martin, a young man who was in his Florida gated community. It quoted Zimmerman talking to a police dispatcher about Martin, saying “this guy looks like he's up to no good. He looks Black.”\n\nIn reality, Zimmerman's description of Martin's activities last longer, and his speculation about Martin's race was a direct response to a police dispatcher's question about it. Zimmerman sued NBC News for libel, a case later thrown out by a judge. NBC apologized to its viewers.\n\nKatie Couric apologized in 2016 when an editor for her “Under the Gun” documentary inserted an eight-second pause after footage of Couric questioning guns right activists about background checks. The activists actually responded right away.\n\nQuotes artificially compressed in BBC documentary\n\nIn the BBC edit, different parts of Trump's 2021 Capitol speech are edited to appear as a single quote: “We're going to walk down to the Capitol and I'll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.”\n\nBut the second two sentences of that quote were actually said nearly an hour later than the first sentence, and part of his speech where he said he wanted supporters to demonstrate peacefully was omitted.\n\nIn an interview that aired Tuesday on Fox News, Trump said, “I guess I have to” sue the BBC. “Because I think they defrauded the public and they've admitted it.”\n\nIn teaching video editing to students at Syracuse University, Jamie Hoskins said she repeatedly emphasizes the need not to be misleading. She's a former news producer who worked in New York City, Washington, D.C. and Buffalo, New York.\n\n“I talk about that in every class at every level,” she said. “You don't want to mischaracterize what people are saying or change their meaning by piecing things together.”\n\nThe proliferation of video — ever shorter, ever snappier — on TikTok and Instagram adds to pressure placed on journalists. The ability of AI to manufacture completely false video is yet another complication. Fake, racist video of Black food assistance recipients complaining about missing benefits due to the government shutdown spread online; a Fox News digital story linked to some of the videos earlier this month and had to be corrected.\n\n“We live in a world now where people can get content from everywhere,” Hoskins said. “There is a difference between content and journalism.”\n\nA new way to protect against complaints\n\nAt the root of Trump's complaint about “60 Minutes” was an exchange between correspondent Bill Whitaker and Kamala Harris, the president's opponent in last year's election. CBS aired two different reports — on “60 Minutes” and “Face the Nation” — depicting Harris giving two different answers to a Whitaker question about the war in the Mideast.\n\nCBS News said both responses were part of Harris' long-winded answer to the same question. But to people who saw both broadcasts, the effect was jarring; other news outlets say they have a strict policy, when they show an interviewer posing a question, that the immediate, direct response is aired.\n\nCBS News defended it as routine editing. But it gave Trump an opening to charge that it was done to benefit Harris' campaign.\n\n“I don't think the practices and standards are worse today than they were a few years ago,” Lukasiewicz said. “I think the consequences of mistakes are more serious than perhaps they used to be,” he said, because of the ability and willingness of politicians to seize on them.\n\nIn Noem's pretaped talk with “Face the Nation” moderator Margaret Brennan this summer, the Homeland Security secretary complained CBS News had “shamefully edited the interview to whitewash the truth.” The network had shortened the interview, removing some accusations Noem had made about Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the immigrant deported by the Trump administration.\n\nIn response, the network said that it would only air interviews on “Face the Nation” that were conducted live or, if taped in advance, would have to air in full.\n\nMore often, networks are defusing potential editing controversies by posting online full, unedited transcripts of key interviews, Lukasiewicz said. CBS News did that immediately when it aired a pre-taped edited interview with Trump on Nov. 2, along with video. The network didn't release a transcript of its Harris interview for more than three months — not until Trump had sued and the FCC launched an investigation of the news division.\n\nThe Trump transcript release created its own issues, with dozens of amateur editors comparing the transcript to the shorter, edited interview that aired on “60 Minutes” to see what producers had decided to leave out.\n\nThis time, though, Trump had no complaints.","summary":"In the space of a few months, a journalistic skill that might seem straightforward to many viewers - editing tape for broadcast - has been behind a $16 million legal settlement, a network's change in how it offers interviews on a news show and, now, the resignation of two top leaders at the BBC.

This includes large tribal organizations, such as the Alaska Federation of Natives, with a membership of 186 tribes, and the Midwest Alliance of Sovereign Tribes, with a membership of 35 tribes,” Lowery said. “It also includes approximately 20 individual tribes that have adopted resolutions of support.”\n\nThe Lumbee Fairness Act would need to be passed by both the House of Representatives and the Senate and then signed by the president. \n\nIn a statement celebrating Native American heritage month, President Donald Trump said full Lumbee recognition was “long overdue.” Both Trump and his opponent in the 2024 presidential election, former-Vice President Kamala Harris, promised the Lumbee federal recognition as the candidates were courting voters in the important swing state of North Carolina. Lumbee voters helped deliver that state to Trump.\n\nDepartment of the Interior representatives did not attend the Senate hearing Wednesday but provided a written statement in support of recognition for the Lumbee Tribe.\n\n“The department supports S.107 as the most direct means to resolve ambiguities in the 1956 Lumbee Act and federally recognize the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina,” Interior officials said in the statement.\n\nLowery said Congress’s failure to fully recognize the tribe through the 1956 Lumbee Act reflected a federal policy at the time aimed at stripping tribes of federal recognition.\n\n“This enactment occurred at the height of the federal Indian Termination Era, when the federal government was actively terminating tribes’ special legal relationship with the United States,” he said in his testimony. \n\nOpponents of the Lumbee Tribe receiving full federal recognition cited a lack of descendancy.\n\nShawnee Chief Ben Barnes said the Lumbee tribe has “shifted from one identity to another.”\n\n“For years, this group claiming to be a sovereign tribe has shifted from one identity to another — the Lost Colony of Roanoke, Croatan, Cherokee, Cheraw, “Siouan,” Lumbee — changing claims but never producing documentation to support any of them,” Barnes said in his testimony to the committee.\n\nIn a press release following the committee hearing, Principal Chief Mitchell Hicks of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians said the Lumbee tribe’s testimony was based on “groundless assertions and storytelling.”\n\n“There is a lawful process created for this purpose administered by the Office of Federal Acknowledgement. That is where claims must be reviewed, and where evidence must be tested,” Hicks said. “If there is evidence, submit it to the OFA. If there is a tribe, the process will show it. But Congress must not legislate identity or manufacture tribes out of thin air by replacing proof with politics. Federal recognition must remain grounded in evidence and truth.”\n\nArlinda Locklear, a Lumbee citizen and attorney for the tribe, told the committee that the Lumbee Tribe meets every standard for federal recognition as set forth in legal precedence. \n\n“In a Supreme Court decision in 1901 called Montoya v. United States … an Indian tribe consists of a body of Indians of the same race, who are united in a community in a particular territory and who are united under one leadership or government,” she said. “You are recognizing a true Indian community.”","url":"https://ictnews.org/news/lumbee-call-for-federal-recognition-during-senate-hearing-despite-opposition/","image":"https://i0.wp.com/ictnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ap_061104018876-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1707&quality=89&ssl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-12 14:00:00","author":"Daniel Herrera Carbajal","authors":["Daniel Herrera Carbajal"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.039},{"id":378139496,"title":"Bihar Election 2025: What are exit polls? Can we trust them? Why do they often go wrong?","text":"All exit polls have predicted a comfortable majority for the Nitish Kumar-led NDA in the Bihar Election 2025. However, most of the journalists, reporters and analysts working on ground zero have disagreed. It also rekindles the exit poll results of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections when the ruling combination was shown getting more than 400 seats in the 543-member house. The exit polls failed; their predictions did not match the actual results. People also recall that the exit polls during the US Presidential Election 2024 predicted Democrat candidate Kamala Harris to win. Republican candidate Donald Trump proved them wrong. After the Bihar Assembly Election, the credibility of the exit polls is once again under question. \n\nWhat are exit polls?\n\nWhat are exit polls? When and how were they started? How are they conducted, and how and why do they fail? An exit poll is a poll conducted by talking to voters when they come out of the polling booth. Pollsters, usually deployed by media houses, private companies, or other agencies, conduct the exit polls with the belief that the votes tell the truth. The polls are just sample surveys that give an idea of what the voters think and how the result may take shape. \n\nHow are exit polls held?\n\nThe pollsters return to each constituency each election and compare the results with those of the previous elections held. They calculate the difference and get what they call 'swing.' These swings are used in other similar constituencies, and they get an idea of the change in the voting pattern and estimate the possible result. They also include a margin of error and predict the results keeping it in mind. \n\nWhy do exit polls fail?\n\nHowever, it is not as simple as it appears. Each polling booth may have voters from different economic, social, and religious backgrounds and of different age groups with different aspirations and needs. This distribution is not even at one polling booth; voters coming to the polling booth at one particular time may vote differently from those coming at a different time. Secondly, the voters may not tell the truth to the pollsters. They may hide it apprehending being identified and retaliated against and punished for voting for a particular party or a candidate. The voters belonging to marginalized communities and poor people are vulnerable and they may hide the truth from the pollsters. It also happens in places with higher political awareness, like Bihar, West Bengal and Kerala. \n\nBihar Election 2025 Exit Polls\n\nIn a country like India, one of the biggest challenges is the cost of the exit polls. The companies supplying ground workers deployed at the polling booths may charge from Rs 500 to Rs 1,000 per person. According to the Election Commission of India (ECI), 45,399 polling stations were made for 122 constituencies in the second phase of the Bihar Election. About 90,000 polling booths were created for the Bihar Elections. If even 20% of polling booths are chosen for gathering samples, the amount to be paid will be tens of lakhs of rupees. There are other expenses as well, like paying experts, psephologists, poll observers and political pundits. How do smaller, lesser-known agencies bear this cost? What if the predictions are proved wrong?\n\nWhen was first exit poll conducted?\n\nDutch sociologist and former politician Marcel van Dam is believed to be the first person to conduct an exit poll. He carried out an exit poll during the Dutch legislative elections on February 15, 1967. Warren Mitofsky was the first American pollster to conduct an exit poll. He did an exit poll for CBS in November 1967, when a gubernatorial election was held in Kentucky. However, some pollsters claim that the first exit poll was held in 1940 in Denver, Colorado.\n\nExit polls in US\n\nThe National Election Pool (NEP), a pollsters' body constituted of members from media houses like ABC, CBS, CNN, and NBC, conducts exit polls in the US. The Egyptian Center for Public Opinion Research conducts exit polls in Egypt. Kantar Public conducts exit polls for KBS, SBS, and MBC in South Korea. The exit polls are banned in Singapore due to privacy issues.","url":"https://www.dnaindia.com/explainer/report-bihar-election-2025-what-are-exit-polls-can-we-trust-them-why-they-often-go-wrong-3188050","image":"https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/full/public/2025/11/12/2730168-bihar-election-2025.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-12 13:40:00","author":"Pm Ist","authors":["Pm Ist"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.337},{"id":378247486,"title":"Why is Trump threatening to sue the BBC for $1 billion?","text":"Donald Trump’s assault on the media went global this week, as he threatened to sue the BBC for $1 billion over a documentary that his lawyer claimed made “false, defamatory, malicious, disparaging, and inflammatory” edits to a speech the US president made before the storming of the Capitol on January 6, 2021.\n“I think I have an obligation to do it … because you can’t allow people to do that,” Trump told Fox News on Tuesday. He said the BBC had “butchered” his “beautiful” and “calming” speech and “made it sound radical.”\nThe threat could tip the BBC into a financial abyss and has deepened the worst crisis for the British public broadcaster in recent history, raising questions about its future in a polarized media and political landscape.\nHere’s what you need to know.\nWhat is the scandal about?\nIn October 2024, days before the US presidential election, the BBC aired a documentary called “Trump: A Second Chance?”\nAt the time, the film gained positive reviews in the UK – the Guardian praised it for taking Trump and the MAGA phenomenon seriously – but attracted little attention in the US.\nAnd that’s how it might have remained, had it not been for a now-notorious leaked memo, which – amid a litany of other complaints about BBC output – revealed how in one small section, the documentary had spliced together comments made nearly an hour apart by Trump during his infamous January 6 speech.\n“We’re gonna walk down to the Capitol and I’ll be there with you and we fight. We fight like hell and if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore,” Trump was shown to say.\nTrump actually said: “We’re gonna walk down to the Capitol and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.” Fifty-four minutes later, he then told his supporters to “fight like hell.”\nIn a letter to a parliamentary committee on Monday, BBC Chair Samir Shah apologized for what he called an “error of judgment” over how Trump’s speech was edited, which he conceded “did give the impression of a direct call for violent action.”\nHow did the scandal originate?\nLast week, a leaked memo to the BBC board from Michael Prescott, a former external adviser to the broadcaster’s editorial standards committee, was published by The Telegraph – a British newspaper, with a rightwing editorial position, that has long been hostile to the BBC.\nIn his memo, compiled this summer, Prescott laid out a long list of alleged shortcomings in the BBC’s news output, from alleged anti-Israel bias in its Arabic-language service to an overly progressive slant in its coverage of transgender people and their rights.\nHe also criticized the “completely misleading” edit of Trump’s speech in the film, which was aired as part of the long-running BBC documentary series “Panorama.” “If BBC journalists are to be allowed to edit video in order to make people ‘say’ things they never actually said, then what value are the Corporation’s guidelines, why should the BBC be trusted, and where will this all end?” he wrote.\nFormer BBC journalists have criticized the broadcaster for failing to address concerns about the documentary, which Shah, the chairman, said had been raised by Prescott and others in a meeting of the editorial standards committee in January.\n“They knew about the problem for 10 months before the newspapers published Prescott’s report,” Mark Urban, the diplomatic editor for BBC Two’s “Newsnight” program until last year, wrote on his Substack. “It’s a serious mistake, why hadn’t they gripped it sooner?”\nEven when The Telegraph’s story broke, the BBC was slow to act. Katie Razzall, the BBC’s media editor, reported Sunday that a statement on the documentary had been “ready to go for days.” Instead, the BBC board decided to apologize in Shah’s letter to the parliamentary committee on Monday. That hesitation appears to have been damaging. Just hours after Shah’s letter was published, the BBC reported Trump’s threat to sue.\nHave heads rolled?\nFormer BBC director general Tim Davie arrives at Broadcasting House, the BBC's headquarters in London, on Tuesday.\nLeon Neal/Getty Images\nYes. The BBC’s director general, Tim Davie, and the chief executive of BBC News, Deborah Turness, resigned Sunday, amid an escalating firestorm over the issues of partiality and bias raised in the Prescott memo.\nIn a statement, Davie conceded “there have been some mistakes” for which he had to take “ultimate responsibility,” but stopped short of mentioning the “Panorama” documentary. In an address to BBC staff on Monday, Davie suggested that his decision was as much to do with the cumulative pressure of five years in the top job as the handling of the Prescott memo itself.\nTurness, who oversaw the news division, said the controversy around the film had “reached a stage where it is causing damage to the BBC.”\n“The buck stops with me,” she said in her resignation statement.\nDespite admitting mistakes, Turness hit back at claims of deliberate bias. “I want to be absolutely clear (that) recent allegations that BBC News is institutionally biased are wrong,” she said.\nWhat is the BBC? Who owns it?\nTrump has expressed disbelief that “one of our great allies” could treat him so dishonestly. “(The) BBC – the government has a chunk of that one, I guess,” he said in Tuesday’s interview with Fox News.\nThe British government does not “have a chunk” of the BBC. The broadcaster is publicly funded but not state-owned. A “royal charter,” which established the BBC as a public corporation in 1927, guarantees its editorial freedom and independence from government.\nIt is funded by a “license fee” – an annual payment of £174.50 ($299) levied on any household that watches live TV, records programs, or uses BBC iPlayer, the broadcaster’s streaming service. It is a criminal offense not to pay the fee.\nSince its founding, the BBC’s mission has been to “act in the public interest” and provide “impartial, high-quality and distinctive output” to “inform, educate and entertain” its audiences.\nMore profoundly, the BBC functions as a sort of national glue, sitting alongside institutions like the monarchy that are supposed to rise above politics and provide a common reference point for the whole country.\nIs the BBC impartial?\nNominally, yes. The license fee is supposed to free the BBC from commercial constraints faced by other outlets, which drive many to tailor their output to the political persuasion of their audiences.\nBut the posture of impartiality has become hard to sustain. In recent years the BBC has faced allegations of bias from both the left and the right, and a polarized political landscape and a fragmented media ecosystem has made it harder to achieve an increasingly mythical ambition to be the singular, non-partisan voice through the nation’s television and radio sets.\nThe BBC has long been criticized by its commercial media rivals, which begrudge its protected, publicly funded status; and by politicians, mostly from the right, who oppose the compulsory license fee and think the BBC should compete for its audience in the free market just like its competitors.\n“The BBC has been institutionally biased for decades,” Nigel Farage, the leader of the upstart anti-immigrant party Reform UK, said Monday, calling for “a very much slimmed down BBC.”\nFarage said he spoke to Trump about the “Panorama” report last week. “He just said to me, ‘Is this how you treat your best ally?’”\nWhat has Trump threatened?\nA lawyer for Trump demanded that the BBC \"appropriately compensate\" the president for the alleged harm caused.\nWill Lanzoni/CNN\nIn a letter to the BBC, a lawyer for Trump said the broadcaster defamed the president by “intentionally and deceitfully” editing the “Panorama” film to try to interfere in the presidential election. Although Trump’s team did not call out the error at the time, the lawyer said this caused the then-candidate “overwhelming financial and reputational harm.”\nTrump wants the BBC to retract the documentary, issue an apology, and “appropriately compensate” him for the alleged harm caused. The BBC has been given until Friday at 5 p.m. ET to respond.\nThe letter said that if those demands were not met, “President Trump will be left with no alternative but to enforce his legal and equitable rights, all of which are expressly reserved and are not waived, including by filing legal action for no less than $1,000,000,000 (One Billion Dollars) in damages.”\nCould the BBC afford to pay $1 billion in damages?\nProbably not. The BBC collected £5.9 billion ($7.8 billion) in revenue in the last financial year, mostly from license fee payments (£3.8 billion), the rest from commercial pursuits.\nIt closed the year with cash reserves of £477 million ($627 million) – a little more than half the amount Trump threatened to sue for.\nAny payout to Trump – even one that was significantly lower than his extravagant demand – would add to the financial pressures faced by the BBC. With the royal charter expiring in 2027, its management might have been optimistic that the BBC-friendly Labour government of Keir Starmer would happily renew it for another decade. The latest crisis could make the government wary of asking the British public to keep paying for a service many have come to resent in an era of cheaper streaming alternatives.\nWhy is the case being brought in Florida?\nIn the UK, and many US states, a defamation case must be launched within 12 months of the alleged libel. In Florida, a victim has 24 months to lodge a complaint.\nStill, bringing the case in Florida will complicate Trump’s argument, according to Mark Stephens, a UK media lawyer at Howard Kennedy, a firm in London.\n“The key question is: Does it damage your reputation?” Stephens told CNN. “He’s going to have to show that somebody in Florida watched this ‘Panorama’ and thought the worse of him. … Did that lower him in the estimation of right-thinking people?”\nHas Trump threatened media outlets before?\nYes, repeatedly. Last year, ABC agreed to pay $15 million in a settlement with Trump in his defamation suit against the network and anchor George Stephanopoulos.\nIn July, Paramount – the parent company of CBS News – also agreed to pay $16 million to resolve a lawsuit filed by Trump over a “60 Minutes” interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris last fall.

We fight like hell and if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore,” Trump was shown to say.\n\nTrump actually said: “We’re gonna walk down to the Capitol and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.” Fifty-four minutes later, he then told his supporters to “fight like hell.”\n\nIn a letter to a parliamentary committee on Monday, BBC Chair Samir Shah apologized for what he called an “error of judgment” over how Trump’s speech was edited, which he conceded “did give the impression of a direct call for violent action.”\n\nHow did the scandal originate?\n\nLast week, a leaked memo to the BBC board from Michael Prescott, a former external adviser to the broadcaster’s editorial standards committee, was published by The Telegraph – a British newspaper, with a rightwing editorial position, that has long been hostile to the BBC.\n\nIn his memo, compiled this summer, Prescott laid out a long list of alleged shortcomings in the BBC’s news output, from alleged anti-Israel bias in its Arabic-language service to an overly progressive slant in its coverage of transgender people and their rights.\n\nHe also criticized the “completely misleading” edit of Trump’s speech in the film, which was aired as part of the long-running BBC documentary series “Panorama.” “If BBC journalists are to be allowed to edit video in order to make people ‘say’ things they never actually said, then what value are the Corporation’s guidelines, why should the BBC be trusted, and where will this all end?” he wrote.\n\nFormer BBC journalists have criticized the broadcaster for failing to address concerns about the documentary, which Shah, the chairman, said had been raised by Prescott and others in a meeting of the editorial standards committee in January.\n\n“They knew about the problem for 10 months before the newspapers published Prescott’s report,” Mark Urban, the diplomatic editor for BBC Two’s “Newsnight” program until last year, wrote on his Substack. “It’s a serious mistake, why hadn’t they gripped it sooner?”\n\nEven when The Telegraph’s story broke, the BBC was slow to act. Katie Razzall, the BBC’s media editor, reported Sunday that a statement on the documentary had been “ready to go for days.” Instead, the BBC board decided to apologize in Shah’s letter to the parliamentary committee on Monday. That hesitation appears to have been damaging. Just hours after Shah’s letter was published, the BBC reported Trump’s threat to sue.\n\nHave heads rolled?\n\nYes. The BBC’s director general, Tim Davie, and the chief executive of BBC News, Deborah Turness, resigned Sunday, amid an escalating firestorm over the issues of partiality and bias raised in the Prescott memo.\n\nIn a statement, Davie conceded “there have been some mistakes” for which he had to take “ultimate responsibility,” but stopped short of mentioning the “Panorama” documentary. In an address to BBC staff on Monday, Davie suggested that his decision was as much to do with the cumulative pressure of five years in the top job as the handling of the Prescott memo itself.\n\nTurness, who oversaw the news division, said the controversy around the film had “reached a stage where it is causing damage to the BBC.”\n\n“The buck stops with me,” she said in her resignation statement.\n\nDespite admitting mistakes, Turness hit back at claims of deliberate bias. “I want to be absolutely clear (that) recent allegations that BBC News is institutionally biased are wrong,” she said.\n\nWhat is the BBC? Who owns it?\n\nTrump has expressed disbelief that “one of our great allies” could treat him so dishonestly. “(The) BBC – the government has a chunk of that one, I guess,” he said in Tuesday’s interview with Fox News.\n\nThe British government does not “have a chunk” of the BBC. The broadcaster is publicly funded but not state-owned. A “royal charter,” which established the BBC as a public corporation in 1927, guarantees its editorial freedom and independence from government.\n\nIt is funded by a “license fee” – an annual payment of £174.50 ($299) levied on any household that watches live TV, records programs, or uses BBC iPlayer, the broadcaster’s streaming service. It is a criminal offense not to pay the fee.\n\nSince its founding, the BBC’s mission has been to “act in the public interest” and provide “impartial, high-quality and distinctive output” to “inform, educate and entertain” its audiences.\n\nMore profoundly, the BBC functions as a sort of national glue, sitting alongside institutions like the monarchy that are supposed to rise above politics and provide a common reference point for the whole country.\n\nIs the BBC impartial?\n\nNominally, yes. The license fee is supposed to free the BBC from commercial constraints faced by other outlets, which drive many to tailor their output to the political persuasion of their audiences.\n\nBut the posture of impartiality has become hard to sustain. In recent years the BBC has faced allegations of bias from both the left and the right, and a polarized political landscape and a fragmented media ecosystem has made it harder to achieve an increasingly mythical ambition to be the singular, non-partisan voice through the nation’s television and radio sets.\n\nThe BBC has long been criticized by its commercial media rivals, which begrudge its protected, publicly funded status; and by politicians, mostly from the right, who oppose the compulsory license fee and think the BBC should compete for its audience in the free market just like its competitors.\n\n“The BBC has been institutionally biased for decades,” Nigel Farage, the leader of the upstart anti-immigrant party Reform UK, said Monday, calling for “a very much slimmed down BBC.”\n\nFarage said he spoke to Trump about the “Panorama” report last week. “He just said to me, ‘Is this how you treat your best ally?’”\n\nWhat has Trump threatened?\n\nIn a letter to the BBC, a lawyer for Trump said the broadcaster defamed the president by “intentionally and deceitfully” editing the “Panorama” film to try to interfere in the presidential election. Although Trump’s team did not call out the error at the time, the lawyer said this caused the then-candidate “overwhelming financial and reputational harm.”\n\nTrump wants the BBC to retract the documentary, issue an apology, and “appropriately compensate” him for the alleged harm caused. The BBC has been given until Friday at 5 p.m. ET to respond.\n\nThe letter said that if those demands were not met, “President Trump will be left with no alternative but to enforce his legal and equitable rights, all of which are expressly reserved and are not waived, including by filing legal action for no less than $1,000,000,000 (One Billion Dollars) in damages.”\n\nCould the BBC afford to pay $1 billion in damages?\n\nProbably not. The BBC collected £5.9 billion ($7.8 billion) in revenue in the last financial year, mostly from license fee payments (£3.8 billion), the rest from commercial pursuits.\n\nIt closed the year with cash reserves of £477 million ($627 million) – a little more than half the amount Trump threatened to sue for.\n\nAny payout to Trump – even one that was significantly lower than his extravagant demand – would add to the financial pressures faced by the BBC. With the royal charter expiring in 2027, its management might have been optimistic that the BBC-friendly Labour government of Keir Starmer would happily renew it for another decade. The latest crisis could make the government wary of asking the British public to keep paying for a service many have come to resent in an era of cheaper streaming alternatives.\n\nWhy is the case being brought in Florida?\n\nIn the UK, and many US states, a defamation case must be launched within 12 months of the alleged libel. In Florida, a victim has 24 months to lodge a complaint.\n\nStill, bringing the case in Florida will complicate Trump’s argument, according to Mark Stephens, a UK media lawyer at Howard Kennedy, a firm in London.\n\n“The key question is: Does it damage your reputation?” Stephens told CNN. “He’s going to have to show that somebody in Florida watched this ‘Panorama’ and thought the worse of him. … Did that lower him in the estimation of right-thinking people?”\n\nHas Trump threatened media outlets before?\n\nYes, repeatedly. Last year, ABC agreed to pay $15 million in a settlement with Trump in his defamation suit against the network and anchor George Stephanopoulos.\n\nIn July, Paramount – the parent company of CBS News – also agreed to pay $16 million to resolve a lawsuit filed by Trump over a “60 Minutes” interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris last fall. As with the BBC, Trump’s grievance was over editing in the program; he claimed the Harris exchange was deliberately edited to benefit her and hurt him.\n\nAnalysts said Paramount likely agreed to settle that case to complete a lucrative merger with Skydance Media, which the Trump administration formally approved in July.\n\nStephens, the lawyer, said that Trump might find it harder to get the BBC to agree to settle, since “he doesn’t have the sort of leverage” over the broadcaster that he did over Paramount.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.\n\nCNN’s Max Foster contributed reporting.","summary":"London  —  Donald Trump’s assault on the media went global this week, as he threatened to sue the BBC for $1 billion over a documentary that his lawyer claimed made “false, defamatory, malicious, disparaging, and inflammatory” edits to a speech the US president made before the storming of the Capitol on January 6, 2021. “I &#8230;\n\n\nThe post Why is Trump threatening to sue the BBC for $1 billion? appeared first on Egypt Independent.","url":"https://egyptindependent.com/why-is-trump-threatening-to-sue-the-bbc-for-1-billion/","image":"https://amayei.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2025/11/2025-11-10t074924z-1066812129-rc2ithajlk87-rtrmadp-3-britain-bbc_jpg.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-12 13:35:25","author":"CNN,Us President Donald","authors":["CNN","Us President Donald"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"eg","sentiment":-0.226},{"id":378247150,"title":"JFK's grandson, Jack Schlossberg, announces 2026 run for Congress","text":"NEW YORK -- Jack Schlossberg, the grandson of former President John F.
