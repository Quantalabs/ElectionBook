On the latest episode of Maher’s \"Club Random\" podcast posted Monday, Allen recalled directing Trump in his 1998 film \"Celebrity\" and praised the former president’s cameo. \"No, I’m not a Trumper. I’m one of the few people who can say he directed Trump. I directed Trump in a movie… in ‘Celebrity.’ And he was, you know, he was a pleasure to work with and a very good actor,\" the 89-year-old director told Maher. BILL MAHER SLAMS MODERN ENTERTAINERS FOR LACKING OLD-SCHOOL WORK ETHIC Playing himself, Trump appeared in a scene with actress Judy Davis, where he discussed tearing down St. Patrick’s Cathedral in New York City and replacing it with a \"very, very tall and beautiful building.\" \"He was very polite and hit his mark and did everything correctly and had a real flair for show business,\" Allen recalled. Maher joked, \"How dare you?\" \"Oh, if you think you were canceled before,\" Maher added sarcastically, apparently referencing the sexual misconduct allegations against Allen, which Allen has denied.

If he would let me direct him now that he’s president, I think I could do wonders.\" \"But he was very easy to work with,\" Allen continued. Maher agreed that Trump is different when he’s not acting as a politician. Maher, who has long been one of the president’s fiercest critics, met with Trump at the White House earlier this year and spoke positively about their encounter. \"Yeah, he’s different in person, and when you say that, people who are purely emotional get very upset, even though it’s just the truth. We’re just saying the truth,\" Maher told Allen.

Kate made a custom poker mat herself, so we’re going to kind of be leaning into it. Our second day is going to be line dancing and everything.”\n\nThe outlet shared photos from the brides’ final fitting at the design house’s atelier in Paris.\n\nThe photos revealed that Moretz’s traditional “something blue” turned out to be her spaghetti strap, satin-embellished floor-length gown by the iconic design house.\n\n“It just feels like me,” the star told the magazine of the unique dress, which included a light blue veil.\n\n“I never really envisioned a wedding dress in my mind growing up, so when we started talking about what that would look like, I knew I would do something non-traditional, and not wear white, and kind of have it feel different, and I think it really does.”\n\nFor her after-party look, the actress settled on a white cowgirl look, including a wide-brimmed hat, a cutout blazer embellished with fringe and sleek trousers.\n\nThe pair kept their respective fashion choices secret from each other until the ceremony — a move Harrison felt would make the vows “special.”\n\n“The thing I’m the most excited for — other than being married — is that first look moment,” the J. Crew model said. Moretz said she was looking forward to “just being together.”\n\n“We’ve been together for almost seven years and making this promise to each other in a new way, and exchanging these vows,” Moretz explained. “I think it’s important to just stay every day choosing each other.”\n\nA rep for Moretz did not immediately return Page Six’s request for comment on the nuptials.\n\nThe couple — who have largely kept their relationship away from the public eye — were first linked in 2018, when they were snapped kissing after a dinner date in Malibu. Moretz publicly came out as a “gay woman” in November of last year while endorsing Kamala Harris for US President. \n\nMoretz seemingly confirmed her engagement to Harrison with a 2024 roundup of photos on New Year’s Eve. The actress included a beach photo of the couple holding hands, with both wearing brilliant-cut diamond engagement rings.\n\nThis story originally appeared on Page Six and is republished here with permission.","summary":"This actress, prolific on film and TV since the age of eight, married her model girlfriend on the weekend after dating for seven years.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity-life/hook-ups-break-ups/former-child-star-chloe-grace-moretzs-samesex-wedding/news-story/5f8b24755c1a3f213f07a8c31ddd6594?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/5c388311d724251ab0b4293ee163dc11","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-01 21:19:14","author":"0 Comments","authors":["0 Comments"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":0.201},{"id":356491272,"title":"Watchdog Report: Two Largest Teachers Unions in U.S. Funneled $43.5 Million to Left-Wing Groups","text":"The two largest teachers unions in the U.S. have dumped a combined $43.5 million into left-wing groups since 2022, according to a conservative watchdog group report.\n\nNational nonprofit group Defending Education released a report last week detailing the contributions of the National Education Association (NEA) and the American Federation of Teachers to far-left groups and causes, citing disclosures to the Department of Labor, Fox News reported.\n\nRELATED VIDEO — CRINGE! Socialist Public School Teacher Rallies Crowd Against ICE and Police:\n\n“It is clear that the teachers unions’ priorities are advancing far-left politics and radical social justice issues, not the education of children,” Defending Ed researcher Rhyen Staley told the outlet. “This is a slap in the face to families and teachers who want to focus on helping students improve their reading and math skills. It is time that Congress acts to stop this obscene redistribution of public monies to advance left-wing identity politics.”\n\nAccording to the report, the unions funneled a combined $1.5 million to left-wing and dark-money groups such as the Tides Network, Sixteen-Thirty Fund, New Venture Fund, and Future Forward, a pro-Kamala Harris group.\n\nThe report additionally found that the unions heavily funded groups that supported left-wing candidates in recent elections, giving significant sums to the Democratic Governors Association as well as the Democrats’ House Majority PAC and Senate Majority PAC. The unions also donated to left-wing think tank Center for American Progress and its 501(c)(4) arm, which bagged nearly one million dollars from the unions since 2022.\n\nWATCH — Linda McMahon to Kick Off ‘Returning Education to the States’ 50-State Tour:\n\nAaron Withe, an expert on public-sector unions, told the outlet that the NEA spent 38 percent of its budget on funding left-wing groups and causes, while only putting 10 percent of its budget toward “representational activities.” \n\n“You’d think in light of the decline in union membership in recent years, that they’d start providing value to members that outweighs the cost of membership,” Withe told the outlet. “Instead, they are appeasing the radical base of union members by advocating for men in women’s sports, transitioning minors, antisemitism and other radical ideological stances.”\n\nWithe called the findings the “tip of the iceberg,” considering “there are thousands of statewide and city and county teachers unions that are mostly funding the same causes.” \n\nNeither union responded to the outlet’s requests for comment by time of publication.","summary":"The two largest teachers unions in the U.S. have dumped a combined $43.5 million into left-wing groups since 2022, according to a conservative watchdog group report.\n\n\nThe post Watchdog Report: Two Largest Teachers Unions in U.S. Funneled $43.5 Million to Left-Wing Groups appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/09/01/watchdog-report-two-largest-teachers-unions-in-u-s-funneled-43-5-million-to-left-wing-groups/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/09/GettyImages2232573327-640x335.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-01 19:11:26","author":"Katherine Hamilton","authors":["Katherine Hamilton"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.183},{"id":356484578,"title":"Pennsylvania nuns who stood up to claims of election fraud win national award","text":"After a conservative activist’s social media post suggested that they were up to something, the Benedictine Sisters went public and ‘contested the falsehood immediately.’\n\nBy Carter Walker for Votebeat\n\nAs the 2024 presidential election approached, tensions were high, and activists were, once again, hunting for fraud.\n\nCliff Maloney, a Republican activist working to get GOP voters to return their mail ballots, said on the social network X that one of his door-to-door canvassers had discovered an address in Erie, Pennsylvania, that had no residents but 53 voters registered to it.\n\n“Turns out it’s the Benedictine Sisters of Erie and NO ONE lives there,” he wrote in a post that went viral, adding that he would not let “Dems count illegal votes.”\n\nBut that wasn’t true. And Maloney found himself being called out by the nuns, who didn’t appreciate being accused of fraud.\n\n“We do live at Mount Saint Benedict Monastery and a simple web search would alert him to our active presence in a number of ministries in Erie,” Sister Stephanie Schmidt, of the Benedictine Sisters of Erie, said in a statement, calling Maloney’s post “blatantly false.”\n\nNow, the sisters are being honored with an award from the National Association of Secretaries of State for their efforts to push back against misinformation. The 2025 Margaret Chase Smith American Democracy Award honors recipients for “individual acts of political courage, uncommon character and selfless action in the realm of public service.”\n\nSecretary of the Commonwealth Al Schmidt, who is not related to Sister Stephanie Schmidt, nominated the sisters.\n\n“The Sisters thoughtfully confronted the baseless claims and used their time in the spotlight to warn the public that ‘a free republic depends … on a discerning and conscientious citizenry who do not unquestioningly accept the word of anyone who has a social media platform,’” Secretary Schmidt said in a statement.\n\nThe award will be presented at the 2026 NASS winter conference in Washington, D.C.\n\nRelated | What to know about the push for open primaries in Pennsylvania\n\nVotebeat and Spotlight PA recently spoke with Sister Linda Romey, director of communications for the monastery, about its response to the accusations and the lessons of the experience.\n\nRomey told Votebeat and Spotlight PA that in addition to the statement it put out, the monastery invited Maloney to visit — an invitation that still stands — but he has yet to come.\n\nThis interview has been edited for brevity and clarity:\n\nHow did you first become aware of Maloney’s post? What was your reaction?\n\nI came into work, and we have a very large email list and have friends across the country. So people who know who we are and what we stand for saw this post, and they were emailing me and Stephanie Schmidt, who was our prioress, our elected leader at the time. … So Stephanie called and she said, ‘How should we respond?’ And I said I think we should put out a press release and address this.\n\nPennsylvania was a battleground state, a very key battleground state in the election, and Erie County was key to Pennsylvania. So we knew that everything here would be scrutinized, and in addition to just wanting to counter what was blatantly false, we wanted to contest that. But we also knew that if Kamala (Harris) were to win the election and then her victory be contested, we didn’t want to become any part of that saying, you know, here’s 50 some false votes that the Democrats came up with and because nobody lives here. We wanted on record that we contested the falsehood immediately.\n\nWhat kind of response did you get?\n\nOverwhelming support, overwhelming. We don’t have an X account, so friends were telling us how the numbers were climbing on the views and the shares, or whatever they call them at X, but even on our social media pages, the support just continued to grow, and then we started getting phone calls. We had more than 25 media outlets contact us over the course of a couple of weeks.\n\nSecretary Schmidt called and spoke with our prioress, Stephanie Schmidt, and offered his support, as did our local election officials. We were in touch with them, and they did support us. Our local mayor knows us and supports us. And other local political figures were behind us also. They all know us, and they know what we do in the city of Erie, and they spoke on our behalf. So yes, we were very, very well supported.\n\nWhat lessons do you hope others will take away from your experience?\n\nTo stand up for truth. Not to back down … if you fall victim to this. But the other thing is, read with conscious discernment. Everybody needs to look at something and read something and then do the necessary background work to know whether or not something should be believed. Because it seems to me that as soon as something is out on social media, it’s taken for fact or for truth, and things are very rarely just that black and white. There’s always room for questions, for more information.","summary":"After a conservative activist’s social media post suggested that they were up to something, the Benedictine Sisters went public and ‘contested the falsehood immediately.’\n\n\n\nBy Carter Walker for Votebeat\n\n\n\n\nAs the 2024 presidential election approached, tensions were high, and activists were, once again, hunting for fraud.\n\n\n\nCliff Maloney, a Republican activist working to get GOP voters to return their mail ballots, said on the social network X that one of his door-to-door canvassers had discovered an address in Erie, Pennsylvania, that had no residents but 53 voters registered to it.\n\n\n\n“Turns out it’s the Benedictine Sisters of Erie and NO ONE lives there,” he wrote in a post that went viral, adding that he would not let “Dems count illegal votes.”\n\n\n\nBut that wasn’t true.

I stole,” during their tour of Biden's office. \n\n \"I saw a little vice president-monogrammed notebook piece of paper that said like, ‘Aubrey Plaza,’ and then three facts about me, like, ‘Wilmington, Delaware, Ursuline Academy, we met,’ blah blah blah,\" she recalled. \"‘Cause that's what the politicians all do.

I’m surprised he wanted to go into politics.”\n\nLast month, reports emerged that Allen sent a letter to Jeffrey Epstein to mark his 63rd birthday in which he jokingly compared the disgraced financier’s dinner parties to Dracula’s castle.\n\nThe note says that the writer and his wife, Soon Yi, had been invited for dinner “many times.”\n\nThey “always accept,” the letter goes on to say, because it is “always interesting” due to the varied and eminent company they expect to find there and because the food is always “sumptuous and abundant” and “well served.”\n\n“I say well served – often it’s by some professional houseman and just as often by several young women reminding one of Castle Dracula where [Bela] Lugosi has three young female vampires who service the place,” the letter continues, referring to the Hungarian-American actor who played the role in the 1931 film.\n\n“Add to this that Jeffrey lives in a vast house alone, one can picture him sleeping in damp earth.”","summary":"The 89-year-old filmmaker directed the president in his 1998 film ‘Celebrity’","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/woody-allen-donald-trump-film-bill-maher-b2817934.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/01/15/38/MixCollage-01-Sep-2025-08-11-AM-7950.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/7kTNGZ4N-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-01 16:16:24","author":"Kevin E G Perry","authors":["Kevin E G Perry"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.258},{"id":356437526,"title":"Democrats’ Chaos Strategy Will Backfire—Here’s Why","text":"Victor Davis Hanson appeared on “The Tony Kinnett Cast” to discuss Democrats, the 2022 election, and more. Watch the interview above or read a transcript, lightly edited for length and clarity. \n\nTony Kinnett: With all of the burning fires, chaos, and shenanigans—and of course, I’m only talking about Minneapolis with the [Democratic National Committee] right now—we have to go to some of the experts to talk about the times these things have happened before. Because I know right now it looks as though, with things descending into chaos, they may not pull out for particular parties, but some people do, in fact, know better. And one of the guys who knows the best of the better is Victor Davis Hanson. You know him. You love him. We all do. Sir, thanks for joining us.\n\nVictor Davis Hanson: Thank you for having me.\n\nKinnett: So, I want to get to your latest book, “The End of Everything: How Wars Descend Into Annihilation.” A nice, calm, soothing work, I’m sure. That’s coming out on [Sept.] 2nd. \n\nBut before we get to that, I got to ask, the chaos, the cacophony of insanity up in Minneapolis, the screeching about land acknowledgements and trans this and [Minnesota Gov.] Tim Walz yelling about red hats—I got to start to say I’m a little curious as to whether or not the Dems are going to be able to pull themselves together in time for the midterm. I mean, do you see them coalescing around anything at all between now and next November?\n\nHanson: Well, they only have one unifying theme, and that is they all want to destroy and they hate [President] Donald Trump. So sometimes they hit watermelons. Sometimes they do the filibuster, [Sen.] Cory Booker style. Sometimes they make those obscene videos. Sometimes they kind of go crazy. But otherwise, they’re not offering any counter agenda. They don’t say, “Well, we would prefer this on the border, and here’s what we’re going to do,” or, “Here’s why we should return to the New Green Deal.”\n\nThey’re on 30% to 40% of every issue. They don’t own the House or the Senate or the White House or the Supreme Court. They lost the popular vote and the Electoral College—first time since 2004. \n\nSo, I think they’re very frustrated, and they’ve got this Jacobin radical base. And I’m not sure that’s the right term for it anymore, base, because I think they’ve taken over the entire party. And what you saw in Minneapolis, whether people like [Sen.] Chuck Schumer or [Rep.] Nancy Pelosi or [Sen.] Elizabeth Warren agree with that doesn’t matter because they condone it and promote it.\n\nAnd I guess only three times in the last a hundred years has the out party in the first term of administration not won House seats. And because it’s so close, it doesn’t mean even though they’re polling as a party about 28%, they feel they can drive down Donald Trump’s. I don’t think the polls are that accurate. It’s probably more like 50/50 rather than some of these crazy polls that have him down 10. But I think it’s pretty close.\n\nBut they feel that the more antics, the more hysteria that they can generate, it’s kind of like collateral damage or a nuclear weapon. It just makes everything so chaotic that they can say, “Trump made us like this. He brought out this. He’s the disruptor.” And you saw that with Tim Walz.\n\nIt doesn’t make sense, but they just want to create a general atmosphere that things are chaotic, that there’s no organization to anything, that we’re in the middle of a tumult, and that they’re going to stop that, and that’s what they plan.\n\nKinnett: So, I see Tim Walz, or I see Sen. Alex Padilla, or one of these—when it was [Rep.] Maxine Waters yelling outside the Department of Education. And I see them trying to push things into this mutually assured destruction, annihilation kind of stuff. But they’re doing so in a way that is really awkward. Like the young lady that Elise [McCue] filmed down at Union Station yelling at the police officer about her keffiyeh.\n\nAnd it just is awkward. We’re starting to go back into that phase where just yelling out in the open carries with it a bit of shame, maybe not for the person that’s doing the yelling, but for the rest of the country. I mean, that theoretically should hurt the voting turnout for that side of the aisle in 2026, but we’re not really doing, in theory, traditional stuff anymore.\n\nHanson: Yeah. I have two views of it. Every data point is negative for them. They not only did not register as many, 2 million, as the Republicans in additional registration, but they lost registration. They’re bleeding about 5 million people a year, leaving the blue states.\n\nKinnett: I was going to say, and that’s just in the 30 states that record voter registration.\n\nHanson: Yes. And in addition to that, if you look at the fertility rate long term, the top 10 red states are up to 1.8 to 2, in the bottom of the 50 states, down to 1.3 and 1.4 are all blue states.\n\nKinnett: Who would’ve thought that telling hyper-depressive ladies that they shouldn’t have children or they’ll kill the planet might have consequences?\n\nHanson: Yeah, that was a bad idea by [Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez], but it kind of predated her. And so, the long term is not good for them. And I think that is a lot of their hysterias. They can’t come out and say, “This is what our agenda is that 55% of the people want,” because their base or this new youth or whatever this group is … so they won’t allow that.\n\nSo, I think their attitude is, “I have to dissimulate. I have to be nominated. If I’m going to get a national candidate, he’s got to get through the primaries. And to get through the primaries, he’s got to be crazy. And then he has to have the gymnastics that he can change and go to the middle to win an election.”\n\nAnd it didn’t work with [former Vice President] Kamala Harris. She tried that half-heartedly at times. But that’s their problem.\n\nKinnett: Isn’t it a little strange that the strategy of we have a California Democrat with a crazy social media strategy is now they’re trying the exact same thing less than a year later that they tried with Kamala. Now they’re trying it with [California Gov. Gavin Newsom] as though that’s going to rally the voters in Pennsylvania.\n\nI mean, at this point, we’ve talked about, you mentioned AOC, the only other contender like [Maryland Gov.] Wes Moore, maybe [former Transportation Secretary] Pete Buttigieg. And did you see the poll suggesting, the Echelon poll, I believe, Pete Buttigieg’s support in the black communities in this country is 0%?\n\nHanson: Yes. He comes off as sanctimonious, self-righteous, sort of an elite scold. He has no charismatic appeal to anybody. And so, he’s not going to be a candidate. And Gavin Newsom’s strategy, he thought, was to sound like the moderate candidate when he had Charlie Kirk and Steve Bannon. And then he realized that he would never be nominated in this lunatic party.\n\nKinnett: Did he invite you on?\n\nHanson: What?\n\nKinnett: Did Newsom invite you on his podcast?\n\nHanson: No. I’ve been very critical of him. So, he’s got this disaster in the Palisades where they haven’t done anything. The whole thing was created by DEI people going to Uganda, the public works people not having hydrants that work, a reservoir was empty, they wouldn’t let people clear the brush—it was a self-created disaster, and now it’s even worse. They won’t allow them. You’ve got the highest taxes in the country, highest gas taxes, highest number of poor people, highest percent—goes on.\n\nKinnett: OK, come on, come on. You’re saying this as though it wouldn’t appeal to Pennsylvania union coal miners or fuel refiners. Man, what an absolute surprise.\n\nHanson: So, I think their only strategy is just to create so much anger and hysteria and street theater about Trump that the people will say to themselves, “Well, I don’t know who’s right. I don’t know who’s right, but I just can’t take it. I’m in a fetal position. I have my hands over my ears. Just make it all go away. Maybe it didn’t happen until Trump came.” \n\nAnd their attitude is, “Well, it was legal to break the law and bring in 10 million, and that was an easy thing to do. But for Trump to enforce the law, that’ll be amoral. And it’s very difficult to find the people we let in, so we’re going to stage these performance art protests against enforcing the law, and people with amnesia will not remember that we broke the law.”\n\nKinnett: You say “performance art” as though this is kind of—I don’t know, this is supposed to be some kind of a colloquial phrase to suggest some type of protest where the heart isn’t in it, it’s just performative. No, they’re actually doing real performance art. I don’t know why I’ve seen the same almost Barney Fife from “The Andy Griffith Show” church choir protest, singing now for Kilmar Abrego Garcia, making up songs and singing out of tune. How is this their strategy?\n\nHanson: I know. They all dress up in the same colors, or they bring a mariachi band.\n\nKinnett: … your expertise is in recognizing patterns throughout history. And this is one of the things that I was always fascinated with, seeing these same things play out again and again.\n\nWhen you have a group of people that are pushing for total chaos, they don’t realize that they could be flirting with the summative annihilation that does, in fact, accompany open chaos and war. And in the new book “The End of Everything,” of course there’s a lot of places that we could go throughout history, talk Carthage, Constantinople, the Mayans, talk about Thebes. But you do the classic Victor Davis Hanson thing by touching on all of those. Tell us about it.\n\nHanson: Well, most wars don’t end with annihilation. They either have a ceasefire or interrupted war until the next one, or a negotiated settlement of some kind or unconditional surrender. We didn’t even destroy Germany. I mean, we hurt it, but we tried to rebuild it very quickly. Same with Japan. But there are times in history where the losers were annihilated, and I define that by losing their language, culture. And they disappeared as a people.\n\nKinnett: Erased from existence, to quote Doc Brown.\n\nHanson: Yes, they did.\n\nSo, I looked at four of them—classical Thebes that Alexander the Great destroyed, and there was no Thebes after. They rebuilt it, but they weren’t rebuilt by Thebans.\n\nKinnett: Because there were no Thebans left to build it.\n\nHanson: Not really, no. He killed all the adult males. He enslaved the rest. And then people in the surrounding area, 16 years later, they rebuilt the city and said they were Thebans. But the dialect, the history, it was all gone.\n\nSame thing with Carthage. Scipio Aemilianus, in the Third Punic War, annihilated, destroyed it. I don’t think he sowed the ground with salt. That was a medieval addition to the story. But there was no Carthaginian language or literature, and there had been, after that.\n\nConstantinople was a little different in 1453. Mehmed, the sultan of the Ottoman Empire, destroyed the city but he kept a lot of the infrastructure intact, but he reengineered the DNA. So, he started to put minarets on the greatest cathedral in Christendom.\n\nKinnett: Like a cultural whitewash that leached more than it just—\n\nHanson: Yes.\n\nKinnett: Well, again, when you say Carthage, a cultural salting of the earth instead, then.\n\nHanson: Yes, exactly. And there was no Byzantine Empire after that in Asia Minor, and it had been there for three millennium. And then Hernan Cortes destroyed, between 1519 and 1521, finally, he destroyed Tenochtitlan, which was the Aztec capital. And there is a Nahuatl language dispersed, but there is no Aztec culture anymore. The conquistadors destroyed the religion, the language, and created a mestizo replacement.\n\nBut again, and then I was wondering, why were these things happening? And the answer is usually that these societies were in decline. They were not aware of it. They didn’t understand the nature of their enemies. They didn’t have any idea that the people outside the walls, they were intellectuals, oddly. Alexander the Great was a student of Aristotle. Scipio was a Scipionic Circle. But they were also psychopaths. They wanted to destroy them, and they were killers. They misinterpreted that, perhaps because—and probably because—they thought they were men that were enlightened and wouldn’t do what everybody said they were going to do. They thought allies would come to their help.\n\nKinnett: And after all, every heart yearns for freedom and love and friendship and other nice, warm nonsense.\n\nHanson: In negotiations, the Romans convinced the Carthaginians to give up their weapons and said that we’ll treat you fairly. And then, of course, they besieged the city and destroyed it.\n\nSo, there was a lot of naivete that people are going to come to help them, that the enemy wouldn’t really do this, that we’re stronger than we think. But there’s not a rational, empirical assessment of who the enemy is, what they have done in the past, what they want to do to us, and what is our present state of readiness.\n\nAnd so, it’s very hard for the British, for example—they ran the world until 1900, basically. And it’s very hard for them not to see themselves still as a major world power. But when you look at the British military or British financial conditions, or the internal disruptions of immigration and things in Britain, it’s not. And it’s a very vulnerable society. I don’t think anybody realizes that it’s sometimes on the verge of total chaos because we never associate Britain.\n\nSame thing with Germany. Germany has been such a power, even though it’s been defeated. But it voluntarily destroyed its energy sector. It’s got the most expensive energy in the Western world. Sixteen percent of the population is foreign-born and not assimilated. It has no military to speak of. And it was the powerhouse of the EU. Now, it’s one of the weakest [gross domestic products]. And as in all these cases I mentioned in the past, it was sort of suicidal. They just run on the fumes of past glory, and they don’t look at what’s happened to them and what needs to be done, as if the remedy or the medicine is worse than the disease.\n\nKinnett: Well, it’s a kind of suicide that isn’t just living off of past glories, but being ashamed for them.\n\nI mean, as Gorbachev later indicated, that one of the greatest successes of the Soviet Union was to try to convince Americans and Western civilization as a whole, including the Brits, and to a lesser extent, the Germans, although, of course, denazification accomplished a lot of this in many ways, rightfully so, but with the Brits, the idea that imperialism and colonialism, that they were a gross evil, gross in the economic and accounting sense, that every action of imperialism or colonialism or the spreading of culture or civilization or victory was so inhumane and evil that the very fabric of that society deserved to erode and to wash away.\n\nAnd well, when the American system started treating every lesson about Columbus as an opportunity to rail against the evils of civilization—of course, now the biggest debate, whether you’re talking about Canada or the U.K., is it going to be the Neo-Caliphate or is it going to be the Indian anarchy that ends up taking over the country? It’s a wild debate to have.\n\nHanson: Yeah, it is. And I don’t think people realize that all civilizations have a degree of fragility. And if you don’t believe that your civilization is preeminent or at least better than the alternative, then history sort of says there’s no reason for you to continue.\n\nKinnett: And the more layers of complexity you add on top of it, the more fragile it gets, from a technological standpoint, but alas—\n\nHanson: It is.\n\nKinnett: … I would love to chat with you for an hour. We’ll have to schedule something in the future. You guys are definitely going to want to check out “The End of Everything” because, unlike a lot of political theory and analysis throughout the histories that are more, let’s say, anecdote and “Here’s my story,” like Kamala Harris’ “107 Days,” whatever, this one actually is good.\n\nHanson: Thank you.\n\nKinnett: So that said, Dr. Victor Davis Hanson, always a pleasure to have you on, Sir.\n\nHanson: Thank you for having me.","summary":"Victor Davis Hanson appeared on &#8220;The Tony Kinnett Cast&#8221; to discuss Democrats, the 2022 election, and more.

Mwenda | The resounding victory of Speaker Anita Among over former Speaker Rebecca Kadaga for the ceremonial position of deputy vice president of the NRM for the eastern region has received the greatest media coverage. This is largely because it pitted two powerful women from that region. And both come from the two largest tribes in the region: Busoga and Teso. Kadaga had the best structural advantage. In the 2011 election, the total registered voters from the Busoga region were 1.8m and from Teso, 900,000. Because there are Itesots in Tororo, their total on the register is about 1.1m.\n\nKadaga could have presented herself to President Yoweri Museveni as the political bull to deliver 80% of Busoga to the party and its leader. Instead, she harped on the past, reciting her role in removing term and age limits, actions long past. Museveni may appreciate that. But he needs votes in the future. This is where Among beat her. She positioned herself as the newcomer to deliver the region—at both the presidential and parliamentary levels—to the president and the party. Second, she had lots of cash to rent political support. Here Among proved to be a better student of democracy than most Ugandan elites educated in the best universities in the world.\n\nIt was alleged that Among spent Shs 300,000 on every one of the 25,000 voters, or Shs 7.5 billion. Many Ugandans went online claiming this was abuse of democracy. Some posts claimed that if this happened in a democracy, Among would be in jail. Clearly, most Ugandans have a very naïve and idealized understanding of democracy. The American philosopher, Will Durant, said that there are three most successful forms of government known to human history. The first is aristocracy, rule by birth. The second is theocracy, rule by religion (led by religious clerics). The third is democracy, rule by money. He could never have put it better.\n\nTake the example of the oldest democracy in the world, the USA. In their last elections of 2024, victory in both the House and Senate races was largely, almost entirely, determined by how much a candidate spent in the campaign: 94% of members of the House of Representatives who won in that election had spent more than the candidate they defeated; for the Senate, it was 88%. It is only in the presidential election that Kamala Harris outspent Donald Trump and lost. Since the year 2,000, the highest percentage of top spenders losing a House race was 14%; for the Senate, it was 20% in 2010.\n\nI have limited data on Western Europe. However, in most democratic elections across Africa and other developing countries, there is a high correlation between money and political success. There are, of course, exceptions. But that is exactly what they are—exceptions to the rule. It is the lesson Museveni learnt along his long political career and one that Among has perfected. In fact, the prostitution of Museveni from a revolutionary with an oversized ambition to transform Uganda to a foxlike politician seeking immediate electoral advantage had disastrous repercussions for our country.\n\nYet many elite Ugandans, idealizing democracy like a religion, cling to the naïve view that what we are witnessing is abuse of it. Far from that. I believe that most of the things we blame Museveni and his NRM for failing to do are a result of democratic pressures. I do not know what would have been Uganda’s performance had we taken an alternative path, perhaps with less democracy. But what I know, and what many scholars, observers, and analysts would agree with, is that Museveni and his NRM were a more enlightened government with a strong commitment to the good of the country before 1996. From thenceforth, there has been a steady decline in the number of public-spirited individuals in high and low politics.\n\nThis is how Among came to be the greatest political genius of our times. She understood that most of our people are poor and need basic things to live their lives. Consequently, the Ugandan government itself is poor and cannot afford to provide the large basket of public goods and services we expect and demand. Uganda spends about $320 per person per year compared to the US, which spends $25,000 per person per year. Hence, even with the best of intentions, the Ugandan government cannot do much for its people. So, voters know that politicians cannot deliver most of what they promise. It’s better to collect kitu kidogo during campaigns than to wait for Santa Claus to deliver air.\n\nI hold strong and self-righteous views about public service. As I have grown older, I have learnt, slowly, to suspend my preconceived value judgements based on my moral tastes in order to gain understanding. It has been the most liberating thing in my intellectual life. It liberated me from partisan anger, from the constant belief that I am virtuous and the people I am criticizing are evil. And once I made that step, I came to analyze politics with dispassionate logic. I became more sympathetic to Museveni and to people like Among, however much their actions repulse my moral tastes.\n\nI realized that in order to judge a leader (or any person) in regard to the decisions they made, the thing is not to seek an ideal solution. Rather, it is to ask: what were the real options this person had when they made this or that choice given the circumstances? For Museveni, Among has been the best Speaker who helps him control not just the NRM MPs in the house but the opposition ones too. At 81 years, the president can no longer afford to keep inviting MPs to State House, serving them tea, giving them envelopes stashed with cash, and personally paying their loans. He subcontracted that role to Among, and she does that job with excellence.\n\nMuseveni was the decisive factor in who won between Kadaga and Among. And if anyone was in his shoes, they would choose Among over Kadaga. The NRM delegates did the same. Kadaga had no money to give them. She did not promise any future but recited her past. NRM has lost most of its ideological resources for persuasion. Hence, there are very limited ideals the party pursues today that can make many people sacrifice material benefits for. That is why the party has degenerated (or let me use a positive term, transitioned) to a cash-and-carry organization. Therefore, whoever has the money always wins. That is democracy 101.\n\namwenda@ugindependent.co.ug","summary":"The best of AM for the next 30 years.

She took to social media after her segment aired to blast the network. \"I joined CBS to report the facts about Kilmar Abrego Garcia. Instead, CBS shamefully edited the interview to whitewash the truth about this MS-13 gang member and the threat he poses to American public safety,\" Noem wrote alongside video clips to back her point. NOEM HITS BACK AT FEMA CRITICS, REVEALS VISION FOR DISASTER RELIEF AGENCY In the clip that aired on television, Noem said, \"Prosecution decisions are always made by the Department of Justice and Pam Bondi’s department, so we will let them do that, although this individual does have criminal charges pending. He has charges pending against him, civilly as well. And the one thing that we will continue to do is to make sure that he doesn’t walk free in the United States of America.\" The on-air portion edited out the rest of her answer and went to O'Keefe's next question about whether the government would still seek to deport him to Uganda. Noem posted a video of her \"uncut response\" that was not shown on the air. However, the whole interview is available on the show's YouTube page. \"This individual was a known human smuggler, an MS-13 gang member, and an individual who is a wife beater, and someone who is so perverted that he solicited nude photos from minors and even his fellow human traffickers told him to knock it off. He was so sick in what he was doing and how he was treating small children. So, he needs to never be in the United States of America, and our administration is making sure we’re doing all that we can,\" Noem said. CBS insists the process met the network's standards. \"Secretary Noem’s \"Face The Nation\" interview was edited for time and met all CBS News standards. The entire interview is publicly available on YouTube, and the full transcript was posted earlier this morning on CBSNews.com,\" a CBS News spokesperson told Fox News Digital. ABREGO GARCIA'S LAWYERS ASK JUDGE FOR GAG ORDER AGAINST TRUMP OFFICIALS Abrego Garcia's lawyers asked a federal judge in Tennessee on Thursday to prohibit top Trump administration officials from making remarks about their client that could bias the jury against him. His defense team said that administration officials have repeatedly accused Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national facing human smuggling charges, of being a criminal gang member and made other negative claims about him that pose a \"substantial likelihood of materially prejudicing this proceeding.\" The attorneys pointed to numerous recent instances, including Noem calling Abrego Garcia an \"MS-13 gang member, human trafficker, serial domestic abuser, and child predator.\" Abrego Garcia was erroneously deported by the Trump administration to a prison in El Salvador in March. The government claimed for nearly two months in combative hearings and court papers that it could not return him, despite an order from the Supreme Court to attempt to do so. The Salvadoran migrant entered the country illegally more than a decade ago, but an immigration judge previously barred the government from sending him back to El Salvador, citing his fears of persecution if he were sent there. In a surprise move in June, the DOJ returned Abrego Garcia to the United States and brought an indictment against him for two counts of conspiring to transport illegal immigrants within the country. He was released from jail last week while he awaits trial, but immigration authorities promptly re-detained him in Maryland, fulfilling fears previously expressed in court by Abrego Garcia and his lawyers. He has denied all the allegations against him. Noem’s claims are not the first time CBS has faced accusations of editing critical rhetoric out of an answer. Paramount Global and CBS settled President Donald Trump’s \"election interference\" lawsuit in July after he accused CBS News of deceitful editing. PARAMOUNT, CBS FORCED TO PAY EIGHT FIGURES, CHANGE EDITORIAL POLICY IN SETTLEMENT WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP Trump was seeking $20 billion in his lawsuit against CBS over its handling of a \"60 Minutes\" interview last year with then-Vice President Kamala Harris, accusing the network of election interference leading up to the 2024 contest. The lawsuit alleged CBS News deceitfully edited an exchange Harris had with \"60 Minutes\" correspondent Bill Whitaker, who asked her why Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wasn't \"listening\" to the Biden administration. Harris was widely mocked for the \"word salad\" answer that aired in a preview clip of the interview on CBS' \"Face the Nation.\" However, when the same question aired during a primetime special on the network, Harris had a different, more concise response. Critics at the time accused CBS News of deceitfully editing Harris' \"word salad\" answer to shield the Democratic nominee from further backlash leading up to Election Day. Trump agreed to receive $16 million upfront to cover legal fees, costs of the case, and contributions to his future presidential library or charitable causes. The president has said another allocation in the eight figures has been set aside for advertisements, public service announcements, or other similar transmissions, in support of conservative causes by the network in the future.

Gowdy, a former prosecutor and Republican congressman, told viewers that aside from one brief moment in a clip, the compilation might fall under “cruel and unusual punishment.” (RELATED: Loogie-Hawking Lawyer On Scooter Confronts National Guard In DC — Instantly Regrets It)\n\n“Welcome back to ‘Sunday Night in America,’ I think. I’m sorry, I should have warned you before you had to witness that,” Gowdy said. “AOC does have a little bit of rhythm, but the rest of that constitutes a cruel and unusual punishment. Democrats have tried embracing criminal defendants, socialism, they tried cursing, dancing cursing while dancing. It might be simpler than that.”\n\nIn one of the songs, protesters in pink vests sang, “Kilmar is our neighbor, you can’t have him, Trump.” Another song featured singers on a stage saying, “We will not obey.”\n\nDemocrats have appeared to struggle with messaging since President Donald Trump defeated then-Vice President Kamala Harris in the Nov. 5, 2024, presidential election, with some turning to profanity.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Jasmine Crockett of Texas unleashed two notable instances noted by Politico. On Feb. 25, she told White House senior advisor Elon Musk to “fuck off” during a media interview, before saying someone should “slap” her to “wake me the fuck up” when talking with a reporter after she walked out of Trump’s March 4 address to Congress.\n\nOver 20 Senate Democrats read the same script on a video posted to social media that included the word “bullshit” in March, drawing criticism from Democratic strategist Lis Smith, who reportedly was responsible for an “R” rating for a documentary about former Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg’s presidential campaign due to her facility for salty language, in an interview with Politico.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York posted a photo on Instagram on July 7 that appeared to be photoshopped to make him look thinner. The post was later deleted.\n\nAlongside the clips of the singing, a video that influencer Sulhee Jessica Woo posted on Instagram on March 5 featuring Democratic Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Lauren Underwood of Illinois, Katherine Clark of Massachusetts, Judy Chu of California, Jasmine Crockett of Texas and Susie Lee of Nevada was also shown. Woo’s 18-second video was similar to the character selection screens of the arcade and console franchise “Street Fighter.”\n\nA similar video of singing protesters was posted in March, showing former National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins leading a crowd of protesters in a song during an anti-Trump rally.\n\n“You got that, so it’s all the good people, but the second line, part of this family, the last line, we’re joined together by this noble dream. Do that with me,” Collins said before breaking into the song.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

The cable news broadcast version of the interview does not include Noem mentioning Garcia’s criminal past.\n\n“This morning, I joined CBS to report the facts about Kilmar Abrego Garcia.

And even his fellow human traffickers told him to knock it off, he was so sick in what he was doing and how he was treating small children,” Noem said in her full answer.\n\nIn the edited version, the segment immediately skipped to CBS News White House correspondent Ed O’Keefe asking whether the administration will continue its effort to deport Garcia to Uganda.\n\nCBS News settled a $36 million lawsuit with Trump in July relating to the editing of a “60 Minutes” interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris. The president alleged that the network participated in “deliberate deception” by omitting parts of Harris’ answer on former President Joe Biden’s stance on Israel to bolster her chances in the 2024 election.\n\nGarcia has been at the center of a deportation case after the administration mistakenly removed him from the U.S. on March 12. The administration maintained that Garcia, who illegally entered the U.S. in 2011, should remain outside of the U.S. due to his alleged ties to MS-13 and his previous deportation orders in 2019.\n\nDocuments provided by Prince George’s County Police Department detailed Garcia’s alleged gang name and rank. In a December 2019 decision, the Board of Immigration Appeals dismissed Abrego Garcia’s challenge to an immigration judge’s factual finding that he is “a verified member of MS-13.”\n\nA judge granted Garcia protected status known as “withholding of removal” in October 2019 after determining that he would likely be persecuted by gangs if deported back to El Salvador, according to the court documents. He settled in Maryland, married American citizen Jennifer Vasquez Sura and has one child.\n\nGarcia was pulled over on a Tennessee highway in 2022 and was suspected of human smuggling after local authorities discovered he was transporting eight passengers with no apparent luggage. The car belonged to an illegal immigrant named Jose Ramon Hernandez-Reyes, who was sent to prison in 2020 for human smuggling.\n\nHis wife obtained a restraining order against Garcia in August 2020, alleging that her husband dragged her out of a vehicle by the hair and left her out in the street, broke down doors in their house in January 2020 and pushed her against a wall while breaking TVs and phones in March 2020.\n\nThe administration facilitated Garcia’s return in June for him to face human smuggling charges. After being released and then immediately taken back into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), an Obama-appointed federal judge in Maryland blocked the administration from deporting Garcia on Aug. 26.\n\nCBS News did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

(RELATED: Bill Maher Shoot Down Biden’s Morehouse Speech Proclaiming America Is Racist)\n\n“He was a pleasure to work with and a very good actor,” Allen told host Bill Maher. “He was very polite and hit his mark and did everything correctly and had a real flair for show business.”\n\nMaher quipped that Allen would be even more “canceled” than he was previously after commending the president.\n\n“I only wish I could direct him now. If he would let me direct him now that he’s president, I think I could do wonders,” Allen added, prompting Maher to laugh raucously. “But he was very easy to work with.”\n\n“He’s different in person. And when you say that, people who are just purely emotional get very upset, even though it’s just the truth,” Maher responded. “We’re just saying the truth.”\n\nMaher received left-wing backlash for attending a March dinner at the White House with Trump, after which he described the president as a “possible friend” and said he felt “comfortable” speaking to him.\n\n“I am a Democrat. I voted for [former Vice President] Kamala Harris. And I take issue with him on 95% of the things, maybe 99%. But as an actor, he was very good,” Allen said. “He was very convincing and he had a charismatic quality as an actor. And I’m surprised he wanted to go into politics.”\n\n“Politics is nothing but headaches and critical decisions and agony. And this was a guy I used to see at the Knick games. And he liked to play golf and he liked to judge beauty contests and he liked to do things that were enjoyable and relaxing,” he continued. “And why anyone would want to suddenly have to deal with the issues of politics is beyond me. But apparently he doesn’t mind.”\n\nMaher also said on a July episode of his podcast that the criticism of his dinner with Trump perfectly illustrated what he viewed as the left’s most self-defeating tendency.\n\n“The stupidest thing the left does — and this dinner is a perfect example of it — is having this attitude toward the right that: ‘We won’t even break bread with you. We are so far above you that we won’t even sit down at the same table with you!’ That is their attitude — and that makes me sick too!” he said.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Furthermore, while the Republican leader engages in childish outbursts and severely jeopardizes the relationship with the world’s largest democracy, it important to note that he has already allowed anti-Indian elements to join his administration.\n\nPro-Khalistan advocate Harmeet Dhillon and half-Pakistani Omeed Malik are two such individuals who belong to the inner circle of the US president. \n\nWho is Omeed Malik \n\n46-year old Omeed Malik was born to Iranian and Pakistani immigrants. He was raised in New Jersey. His parents held Democratic political fundraisers, reported The Free Press. He was also a staunch supporter and voted twice for former president Barack Hussein Obama, donated to Hillary Clinton as well as served in Congress for two New Jersey Democrats.\n\nNevertheless, Malik grew disillusioned with the party following movements such as “Black Lives Matter,” “Me Too” and other liberal policies, ultimately deciding to switch sides. He is now in the epicentre of the MAGA (Make America Great Again) where power, money and politics collide during Trump’s second term in ways that frequently spark controversy within and outside of the establishment.\n\nHis friendship with Donald Trump Junior has reportedly made him associated with the messy financial affairs of the Trump family. The pair met in the summer of 2019 at a Hamptons party and started meeting regularly. He had known Kimberly Guilfoyle, Trump Junior’s then girlfriend for 10 years.\n\nTrump Junior asked Malik to attend a 2020 presidential campaign fundraiser that summer. Afterward, he made his first donation of $5,600 to Trump only a month after giving $2,800 to Joe Biden. The current president’s eldest son is also a partner at Malik’s “1789 Capital” which was the biggest investor in journalist Tucker Carlson’s company. Carlson and Malik became friends in 2015 during their time at Bank of America.\n\nThe ex-Fox host, infamous for his anti-Israel rhetoric, has made no secret of his prejudice against India and praised the British Empire as beneficial to the subcontinent. “Strong countries dominate weak countries. This trend hasn’t changed. When the British pulled out of India, they left behind an entire civilisation, a language, a legal system, schools, churches and public buildings, all of which are still in use today,” he argued in 2022, resulting in a backlash. \n\nMalik has been the target of multiple charges due to his firm’s ownership in Tucker Carlson Network (TCN). Laura Loomer painted him as the mastermind behind Carlson’s criticism of Israel and the introduction of guests with divisive opinions. A man who alleged that Adolf Hitler was in heaven was interviewed by Carlson last year. \n\nThe same person later returned for another program about sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein and was described as “the best and most honest popular historian in the United States,” by Carlson. Moreover, MAGA became embroiled in a contentious discussion concerning the Israel-Iran issue when he interviewed the Iranian president in July. \n\nMalik’s name had surfaced once more, including in an X post referring to him as the network’s “key backer.” 1789 Capital is no longer involved as an investor in Carlson’s company which completed the buyout of all its investors in March.\n\nOmeed Malik’s profound ties with Trump administration \n\nMalik was a part of the Council on Foreign Relations, a gathering place for Washington and Wall Street insiders. He contributed money to the Milken Institute, a prominent think tank. Additionally, he was on the board of Network 20/20, a foreign policy nonprofit that has hosted yearly galas honouring liberal figures including the notorious George Soros.\n\nMalik quit Bank of America in 2018 to launch his own financial advising business. According to media reports, the corporation accused him of personal conduct that went beyond corporate standards and he was sacked after being charge with inappropriate behaviour. He adamantly disputed any wrongdoing and sued Bank of America for over $100 million. Later the two sides came to an eight-figure settlement and Malik used the amount to launch Farvahar Partners, his investing company.\n\nMalik landed in Florida in 2021 and quickly rooted himself in the Republican political landscape there. He also joined the conservative donor organisation Rockbridge Network which was founded by JD Vance and Chris Buskirk, a co-founder of 1789 Capital and publisher of the right-wing website American Greatness.\n\nMalik founded “1789 Capital” in 2023 alongside Buskirk and Republican megadonor Rebekah Mercer whose family financed anti-India Breitbart News. The first investment made by his company was in Carlson’s network.\n\nMalik has become one of most well-known entrepreneurs in the Trump world. He spends a lot of time at Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida where he sends cheques to Republican candidates and charities totalling tens of thousands of dollars at a time. A little over ten years before Scott Bessent was appointed treasury secretary for Trump, he met him and assisted him in launching his first hedge fund in 2015.\n\nBessent recently reiterated Rahul Gandhi’s Adani-Ambani jibe, asserting that the “wealthiest Indian families” are profiting from Russian oil. \n\nMalik is profoundly engaged with the present administration and collaborates on numerous projects with Trump Junior, including the establishment of a “parallel economy” to bolster anti-Democratic enterprises as well as a club alongside investments in various conservative initiatives including those bigoted sentiments towards India, Hindus and Modi government. \n\nMeet pro-Khalistani separatist Harmeet Dhillon \n\nDonald Trump appointed Indian-American Harmeet Kaur Dhillon as the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights in the US Department of Justice following his re-election to the office. She has a legal practice called “The Dhillon Law Group” which has offices throughout the country. However, her inclusion in the Trump administration caused her to leave the company in 2025.\n\nHer controversial past and open support for the separatist Khalistan movement rapidly drew scrutiny and objections regarding her position in the administration.\n\nDhillon has been repeatedly charged with supporting Khalistanis based in the United States and having sympathy for their nefarious agenda. She has been a vocal supporter of the anti-India bandwagon, accusing New Delhi of running “death squads” to the US as well as Canada and implying that the Indian diaspora “participated” in the killing of critics.\n\nIndia’s American death squad indictment. America’s Sikhs want answers: who else at risk, & what is US government doing about assassination attempts on US citizens? Indian-American Dems in Congress strangely silent. @RoKhanna? @RepBera?@ShriThanedar @CongressmanRaja? @RepJayapal? https://t.co/LdWjV34kOl— Harmeet K. Dhillon (@HarmeetKDhillon) November 29, 2023\n\nDhillon alleged that Modi government was behind the assassination of Khalistani elements and claimed the Indian American democrats were “strangely silent.” She even asked about the measures taken by the United States government to ensure the safety of the country’s citizens. \n\nAlso assassinating India's critics in the diaspora. Full service! https://t.co/WDyk7MuL2W— Harmeet K. Dhillon (@HarmeetKDhillon) March 29, 2024\n\nDhillon even cited Pierre Poilievre, the leader of the opposition in Canada who backed Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s outrageous allegations against India for the “extrajudicial murder of Sikh leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar.” She termed him as a “Sikh leader” rather than a “Khalistani leader” to capitalise on the religious convictions of the Sikh diaspora in the US while also underplaying the radical ideology he promoted.\n\nCanada’s conservative leader joins other Canadian officials in condemning the extrajudicial murder of Sikh leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar. Good to see them unite against this shocking act. https://t.co/vObNOuzl8o— Harmeet K. Dhillon (@HarmeetKDhillon) September 19, 2023\n\nDhillon even mentioned a Reuters article about purported violations of human rights in India and commented that Punjab’s residents suffered as a result of the recent internet outage. She further stressed that Sikh activists and journalists had been singled out. She was alluding to the internet shutdown in Punjab which was implemented as part of a crackdown on Khalistani preacher and MP Amritpal Singh to prevent the transmission of false information. \n\nDhillon was previously a supporter of Democratic leader Kamala Harris. According to reports, she made political contributions during the latter’s campaign for district attorney of San Francisco. However, she was seen using caste rhetoric to criticize the former vice president during her appearance on Carlson’s show after the dramatic change in her political allegiances.\n\nAddressing the pronunciation of her name by Harris, Dhillon indicated that she stresses the second syllable, thus making it Kamala whereas Camala is how it is called in India. “She comes from a high-caste Brahmin family. Her mother is a Brahmin,” Dhillon pointed out to which a scornful Carlson responded, “I thought she was oppressed.” She then retorted that Harris is a shape-shifter.\n\nHarmeet K Dhillon brought up Kamala Harris's caste to target her during an interview with Tucker Carlson.Now the MAGA base is attacking her (again) over her Sikh identity.Well. pic.twitter.com/ym2eKK40qN— Sensei Kraken Zero (@YearOfTheKraken) June 8, 2025\n\nThe Trump administration also perpetuates this unfounded Brahmin-privilege narrative in their ludicrous attacks on India regarding the purchase of Russian oil. White House Trade Adviser Peter Navarro tried to invoke caste politics and insisted that Brahmins are the true beneficiaries of this trade. \n\nDhillon also faced corruption charges after a June 2023 story in The Guardian revealed that a non-profit under her leadership invested over $1 million in her legal practice.\n\n“The Guardian has found that at least $1.32m has been transferred from the Center for American Liberty (CAL) to her law firm, Dhillon Law Group, in a move one charity expert described as problematic. Additionally, state and federal filings show Dhillon takes a $120,000 salary from CAL for a two-hour work week,” the report unveiled. \n\nHarmeet Dhillon’s equally radical law firm partner\n\nJohn-Paul-Deol is one of the partners in “The Dhillon Law Group.” He acts like an online troll who regularly insults Hindus and Hindu gods. He sent out a disparaging tweet for Lord Shiva in reaction to a user’s post denouncing terrorist Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale on The Wire’s article, in 2023.\n\nAlthough the tweet was eventually removed, he has a history of using casteist and racial epithets to attack Hindus and Sikhs who don’t share his beliefs. He frequently targets “Brahmins,” mocks Hindus as “Lindus” and calls them the most “backward civilization.” \n\nDeol, a fervent supporter of the anti-caste Hinduphobic law in the United States, likewise demonised Vedas by associating them with caste. Ironically, he dubbed a fellow Sikh named Puneet Sahani as “Mahachura” for exposing the agenda. \n\nDeol even dog-whistled about an Federal Bureau of Investigation special agent of Indian descent following the arrest of terrorist Harpeet Singh, who was in charge of carrying out assaults in Punjab, by the FBI field office in Sacramento. He shared a photograph of the officer with “accha (okay)” and later justified his action by claiming that the agency had already posted about the latter.\n\nThe only thing greater than Trump’s conceited conduct is his misguided notions about the sway he thinks he possesses over the rest of the world. He is employing every fraudulent propaganda peddled by the Indian opposition regarding the connection between Gautam Aadani and Mukesh Ambani with the Modi government as well as the caste-politics plank to provoke voters, in order to intimidate New Delhi into complying with his demands.\n\nTrump’s desperation has led him to reduce international diplomacy to mere local political maneuvering but India stands firm, only adding to his frustration. Nonetheless, the recent developments that might appear unprecedented are, in reality, not particularly surprising, considering Trump’s inflated ego and the anti-India individuals he has surrounded himself with, who have not only refrained from vocally opposing India but have also glorified Khalistani terrorism.","summary":"Donald Trump appointed Indian-American Harmeet Kaur Dhillon as the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights in the US Department of Justice following his re-election to the office.

Must Be Part of Every Single Vote,” the president posted on Truth Social on Saturday. “NO EXCEPTIONS! I Will Be Doing An Executive Order To That End!!! Also, No Mail-In Voting, Except For Those That Are Very Ill, And The Far Away Military. USE PAPER BALLOTS ONLY!!!” \n\nThe U.S. Constitution hands responsibility for the regulation of elections to the states while granting Congress the power to introduce new federal laws at a national level. It makes no provision for the president’s involvement because of the obvious conflict of interest that would create.\n\nThirty-six states already have laws in place requiring voters to present ID to polling officials, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\nTrump raised eyebrows in January this year when he demanded that California introduce a voter ID law in exchange for federal emergency relief after the blue state was devastated by winter wildfires.\n\nHe subsequently attempted to mandate proof of citizenship as a condition for voting but was blocked by a federal judge in June, who said the requirement would risk disenfranchising millions of Americans who do not have passports or ready access to their birth certificate or who may have only recently changed their name, for instance after getting married.\n\n“As many as 11 percent of eligible voters do not have the kind of ID that is required by states with strict ID requirements, and that percentage is even higher among seniors, minorities, people with disabilities, low-income voters, and students,” the Brennan Center for Justice has warned. \n\nTrump appears to remain fixated on the issue of voter fraud in the wake of his defeat to Joe Biden in the November 2020 presidential election, despite no evidence ever being produced to substantiate his repeated claims.\n\nMail-in voting has been a particular focus for his ire and he has repeatedly alleged that it is uniquely vulnerable to fraud, although, ironically, postal votes played an important role in securing his victory over Kamala Harris last year. \n\nTrump and the Republican Party are already looking ahead to the November 2026 midterms, which has seen a major controversy erupt in Texas this month over the GOP’s efforts to redraw the state’s electoral map to its advantage, provoking a retaliatory push from Democrats in California.\n\nAmong those reacting to Trump’s post insisting on voter ID was Norm Eisen, former White House special counsel for ethics and government reform, who threatened a legal challenge.\n\n“Go ahead, make my day Mr Trump,” Eisen wrote. “We at Democracy Defenders Fund immediately sued you and got an injunction on your first voting EO. We will do the same here if you try it again. The Constitution gives this authority to the states and Congress, not you!”\n\nPolitical commentator Brian Krassenstein agreed: “This is illegal. Trump can NOT unilaterally ban mail-in voting or require voter ID.”","summary":"President insists on citizens presenting valid identification before voting with ‘no exceptions’ but lacks the authority to support such a dictate","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-voter-id-mandate-unconstitutional-b2817780.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/03/22/41/GettyImages-2178247490.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/Iv8uDvvV-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-01 12:04:06","author":"Joe Sommerlad","authors":["Joe Sommerlad"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.344},{"id":356373182,"title":"This ‘Ends The Fed’—U.S. Dollar Crisis Predicted To Spark A ‘Critical’ Bitcoin Price Tipping Point","text":"Bitcoin has lost steam from its recent rally, falling back from an all-time high of $124,000 per bitcoin amid a sudden crisis at the Federal Reserve.\n\nSign up now for CryptoCodex—A free crypto newsletter that will get you ahead of the market\n\nThe bitcoin price is up almost double from this time last year, with bitcoin braced for $20 million to $28 million of daily buying pressure that some think could create the new “Rockefellers or Rothschilds.”\n\nNow, as a surprising celebrity suddenly jumps on the crypto bandwagon, the former chief technology officer at bitcoin and crypto exchange Coinbase has predicted bitcoin will \"end the Fed.\"\n\nSign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run\n\nForbesDonald Trump Has A Secret Weapon In His War On The FedBy Billy Bambrough\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nJerome Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve, is battling stubborn inflation that's pushed the bitcoin price higher.\nGetty Images\n\n\"When bitcoin wins, it ends the Fed,\" Balaji Srinivasan, the author of The Network State who left Coinbase in 2019, said during a speech at Bitcoin Asia. “And what does that mean?

He was the only potential 2028 Democratic presidential candidate who saw gains in the survey.\n\nTouted by many as a potential replacement for the ailing Joe Biden as the 2024 Democrat presidential nominee, Newsom didn’t have a chance to stand as Biden passed the mantle directly to Kamala Harris. \n\nBut in the past few months the charismatic former mayor of San Francisco has been increasingly outspoken in his criticism of the Trump administration. On August 27 he said Americans needed to “wake up” to threats he said were posed by the current administration. \n\nPart of Newsom’s approach has recently been to adopt the same mass communication methods as Trump has. This is not the highbrow intellectual route that Democrats have taken in the past. This is AI slop – the low-quality, mass-produced online content generated by artificial intelligence, designed to manipulate social media platform’s algorithms for greater exposure.\n\nNew social media style\n\nOver the past few weeks, Newsom’s team has released numerous social media messages mimicking and mocking Donald Trump.\n\nFor instance, this month, Newsom’s staff posted a message on X featuring an AI-generated image of the governor wearing a crown on the cover of Time magazine, accompanied by the caption: “Long Live the King.” The following day, the same account reposted an AI-generated image of a muscular Newsom holding the American flag with the caption: “In Gavin We Trust.”\n\nThe approach seems to be popular. Newsom’s team also released parody-Trump merchandise with reports suggested that it raised US$100,000 (£73,900) online on its first day of release. And Newsom’s use of this AI-produced content may well be redefining how Democrats attack Republicans in the future.\n\nNewsom made no excuses for taking such a route. When questioned by Fox LA about this new approach recently he said: “I’ve changed, the facts have changed; we (the Democrats) need to change.”\n\nThe California governor is not the only Democrat to stand up to Trump. While Democrats in Congress are hamstrung by the Republican majority in both the House and Senate, elected Democrat officials in state governments are working hard to limit Trump’s influence.\n\nWhen Trump federalised the California National Guard to end public protests against the activities of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (Ice), Newsom and California’s attorney-general, Rob Bonta, sued Trump, defense secretary Pete Hegseth, and the Department of Defense.\n\nNewsom and Bonta argued that the president had exceeded his constitutional authority, as such action had been taken without the governor’s consent. Newsom defiantly declared that: “The president is not a king and is not above the law.”\n\nAn appeals court allowed Trump to retain control of the National Guard while the lawsuit continued. The federal trial opened in San Francisco on August 11, and a judgment had not been released as this article went live.\n\nAs well as ordering the Department of Defense to create specialist National Guard units to deal with civil unrest, Trump has also threatened to use troops in other Democrat-controlled cities such as Baltimore and New York, where he also claims that state governments are failing to deal with crime waves.\n\nOn August 26, in an eloquent but defiant speech, Illinois governor JB Pritzker warned Trump not to send troops to Chicago: “Mr President, do not come to Chicago. You are neither wanted here nor needed here,” Pritzker said.\n\nMirroring Newsom’s claims of executive overreach, Pritzker said that Trump’s determination to use troops to reduce crime figures in Democrat-controlled cities around the country was to “lay the groundwork to circumvent our democracy, militarise our cities and end elections”.\n\n“If this were happening in any other country, we would have no trouble calling it what it is, a dangerous power grab,” Pritzker said.\n\nTrump has used the National Guard as a law enforcement tool in Washington DC, another Democrat-controlled city, since the middle of August. The US president sent troops, complete with armoured vehicles, to the nation’s capital, where he claimed violent crime was out of control. While the troops were initially unarmed, in the past week officials have said that guard members have been authorised to carry either their M17 pistols or M4 rifles.\n\nAccording to figures released by the Washington Metropolitan Police Department, violent offences were at their lowest level in 2024 in 30 years. The pattern appears to be continuing in 2025, with violent crime down 26% compared to this time last year and robberies falling by 28%. The Democrat mayor of Washington DC, Muriel Bowser, called Trump’s deployment of troops an “authoritarian push”.\n\nIt turns out the use of troops in Washington DC has not gone down that well with Americans. According to a Reuters/Ipsos poll during the last week in August, only 38% of Americans supported Trump’s actions, with 46% opposed.\n\nAfter what had seemed to be a good start to the year for Trump, his job approval rating is fragile. With the midterms just over a year away, the Republicans need to keep one eye on the polls if they wish to retain their majorities in the House and Senate.\n\nWhether Newsom’s pushback against the administration is the start of his campaign for 2028 is unclear, but it would do him no harm to establish himself as a national political figure, a portrayal with which he can build a campaign for 2028.","summary":"Democrats are pushing back against Trump by testing out some new tactics.","url":"https://theconversation.com/democrats-dig-in-with-a-new-type-of-campaign-against-trump-263869","image":"https://images.theconversation.com/files/688043/original/file-20250828-238151-5yylet.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C250%2C2999%2C1499&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-01 11:28:24","author":"Dafydd Townley,Teaching Fellow in US politics and international security,University of Portsmouth","authors":["Dafydd Townley","Teaching Fellow in US politics and international security","University of Portsmouth"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.015},{"id":356377686,"title":"Emotionally damaged Trump is a born loser","text":"I must admit, if Trump wasn't such a power-hungry demagogue, a danger to democracy, a sexual predator, racist, sociopath, pathological liar, bully, and impulsive and unstable megalomaniac, I might feel sorry for him.\n\nHe has no real friends, just sycophants. All his relationships are transactions, including with his three wives and his children. When people are no longer useful to him—wives, lawyers, advisors, Cabinet members—he discards them.\n\nHis current wife Melania is transactional, too. She married him for his money. She obviously doesn't love or respect him and she occasionally displays her disdain for him in public. She didn’t even campaign for him last year, except to make a few public appearances. \n\nTrump hardly ever laughs. He has an almost-constant angry scowl on his face. To Trump, the world is a dark and foreboding place, where, like him, people are consumed by greed and lust. He relies on money and intimidation to get what he wants because he has no capacity for empathy or love—or any belief that people can be motivated by idealism and compassion.\n\nTrump grew up in a world of vast privilege, but that doesn't mean that he wasn't emotionally wounded.\n\nBoth the federal raids on immigrants in Los Angeles and the upcoming military parade in Washington, D.C. reflect Trump’s need to look tough, manly, and in control.\n\nAccording to his niece Mary Trump, a clinical psychologist, he was bullied by his father, who must have told Donald that he wasn't smart and that he was (or should be worried about being) a loser. In 2017, 27 psychiatrists and mental health experts published a book, The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump, warning that he was erratic and unstable as pressures mounted on him. Two years later, they updated the book—this time with 37 experts weighing in on Trump’s troubled mental health.\n\nHe has no strong beliefs about governing or public policy. His major motivations are money, power, revenge, racism, and adulation.\n\nOne of Trump’s few joys in life are the cheers from his fans at MAGA rallies. So, to compensate for his insecurities, feed his ego, and to mobilize his MAGA followers, he has planned this massive parade on June 14—today—ostensibly to celebrate the U.S. Army’s 250th birthday, but which also just happens to coincide with this 79th birthday. The plan is to include 6,600 soldiers, 150 vehicles, 50 helicopters, and seven military bands, and 34 horses—at a cost of about $50 million—money that could otherwise be spent on improving the lives of soldiers and military veterans. The event will require the closure of Ronald Reagan National Airport to accommodate flyovers and fireworks displays. Trump intends it as a display of force, domination, and personal power. It is more about him than about honoring our soldiers and veterans. \n\nIn U.S. history, large military parades have typically come at the end of wars as part of demobilizing troops and celebrating getting the country back to normal. But such spectacles have a long tradition in authoritarian countries, where dictators, including the current rulers of Russian and North Korea, seek to bind themselves to national identity. The most disreputable of these displays of dominance were the mass rallies and parades organized by the Nazis to celebrate Adolf Hitler, depicted in Leni Riefenstahl’s pathbreaking propaganda film “Triumph of the Will,” that celebrated Hitler speaking at a massive Nazi Party rally in Nurenberg in 1934. \n\nHaving won a second term, Trump is now wants to consolidate his grip on power. He’s sought to bend those whom he views as his critics and opponents—universities, media companies, law firms, judges, businesses, scientists, artists and performers, and even professional sports teams—to his will. Both the federal raids on immigrants in Los Angeles and the upcoming military parade in Washington, D.C. reflect Trump’s need to look tough, manly, and in control.\n\nFrom his father, who was arrested at a Klan rally in 1927, he also absorbed the racist ideas of the fake science of eugenics, which was popular in America in the early 1900s.\n\nIn 1988, he told Oprah Winfrey that a person had “to have the right genes” in order to achieve great fortune. In 2010, he told CNN that he was a “gene believer,” explaining that “when you connect two racehorses, you usually end up with a fast horse.” He compared his own “gene pool” to that of successful thoroughbreds. During a 2020 campaign speech to a crowd of white supporters in Minnesota, Trump said, “You have good genes, you know that, right? You have good genes. A lot of it is about the genes, isn’t it, don’t you believe? You have good genes in Minnesota.”\n\nBut in fact, Trump has thus always been insecure about his family's genes. His father lied about his family's heritage, pretending that the Trumps were from Swedish, not German, ancestry. Trump repeated the lie in his book, The Art of the Deal. (He later said that he wouldn't mind if the US had more immigrants from Scandinavia, but kept out immigrants from \"shithole countries,\" an outrageously racist comment). Trump said at a rally in Iowa that immigrants are \"poisoning the blood of the country. They're destroying the fabric of our country, and we're going to have to get them out.\"\n\nTrump believes that most white Americans share his racism toward immigrants and that he can weaponize that hatred by carrying out a mass deportation of people he calls “illegal” and “criminals.” He’s sent federal agents to Los Angeles to arrest immigrant workers and parents, followed by National Guard troops to intimidate and arrest those who are protesting the anti-immigrant raids. This is all designed to create fear and chaos to give Trump cover as the “law and order” president and, as Rep. Laura Friedman (D-CA) noted, “an excuse to declare martial law in California.” The timing is no accident. The federal raids—which Trump is likely to expand to other cities—are meant to divert public attention from Trump’s legislative plan to cut Medicaid and other essential programs in order to give a huge tax cut to the super-rich. \n\nTrump often claims that he's a self-made billionaire. In fact, he inherited his father's wealth, as reporters Russ Buettner and Susanne Craig explain in their 2024 book, Lucky Loser: How Donald Trump Squandered His Father’s Fortune and Created the Illusion of Success. His father bankrolled his developments and bailed him out when they failed. Despite his boasts, he knows that most of his business ventures—his casinos, hotels, golf courses, fake university, airline, football team, clothing line, steaks, and others—failed. Most banks won't go near Trump, because they consider him a toxic grifter who consistently defrauds his subcontractors, employees, and lenders. According to Forbes magazine—which ranks the world’s billionaires—Trump was never as wealthy as he claimed to be.\n\nThe timing is no accident. The federal raids—which Trump is likely to expand to other cities—are meant to divert public attention from Trump’s legislative plan to cut Medicaid and other essential programs in order to give a huge tax cut to the super-rich.\n\nTrump's favorite insults, directed toward people he considers his enemies, are \"not smart\" and \"losers.\" Clearly the man is projecting.\n\nTrump was terrified of losing last year’s election because he might have had to go to prison and also because he'd be viewed as a \"loser,\" which in his mind is the worst thing you can be, a consequence of his father's disparagement and his mother's neglect. He was doubly worried that he might lose to a Black woman, Kamala Harris, whom he described as “not smart.” \n\nTrump is clearly insecure about his mental abilities and worries that it's due to his inferior genes. He’s boasted that he comes from a superior genetic stock and that he is a \"very stable genius.\" For years, he has constantly insisted that \"I'm smart.\" “Throughout my life,” Trump tweeted in 2018, “my two greatest assets have been mental stability and being, like, really smart.” He lied about being first in his class in college. He didn't even make the Dean's List. Whenever he has defended his intelligence, it isn't clear if he's trying to convince his interviewers or himself. \n\nHe’s even defensive about his vocabulary. He claims to have \"great words,\" although linguists who have studied his speeches and other statements say he has the vocabulary of an adolescent. He doesn't read—for pleasure or work. As president, he doesn’t read the memos prepared for him by his staff, including intelligence briefs. Some observers attributed this to his arrogance. But more likely it is because he can’t understand what is in them. He'd rather be considered arrogant than stupid. \n\nAt least 26 of his top aides publicly said that Trump was unfit to be president. They questioned his competence, character, impulsiveness, narcissism, judgement, intelligence, and even his sanity. \n\nAccording to Michael Wolff, in his book, Fire and Fury, both former chief of staff Reince Priebus and ex-Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin called Trump an “idiot.” Trump’s one-time economic adviser Gary Cohn said Trump was “dumb as shit.” His national security adviser H.R. McMaster described the president as a “dope.” In July 2017, news stories reported that Rex Tillerson, Trump’s first Secretary of State, called the president a “moron.” When asked, he did not deny using that term. In an interview with Foreign Affairs magazine, Tillerson recounted that Trump’s “understanding of global events, his understanding of global history, his understanding of U.S. history was really limited.” He said, “It’s really hard to have a conversation with someone who doesn’t even understand the concept for why we’re talking about this.”\n\n“Anyone who puts himself over the Constitution should never be president of the United States,” said his former Vice President, Mike Pence. Mark Esper, one of Trump’s Defense Secretaries, said that Trump is not “fit for office because he puts himself first, and I think anybody running for office should put the country first.” In his farewell speech, Mark Milley, a retired Army general who served as chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from October 1, 2019, to September 30, 2023, warned “We don’t take an oath to a wannabe dictator,” clearly referring to Trump. John Kelly, a retired Marine Corps four-star general who served as chief of staff from 2017 to 2019, said that Trump “admires autocrats and murderous dictators” and “has nothing but contempt for our democratic institutions, our Constitution, and the rule of law.” \n\nSoon after the January 6, 2021 insurrection, McMaster, the former national security advisor, told CNN’s Jake Tapper that Trump had incited the riot through “sustained disinformation… spreading these unfounded conspiracy theories.” He accused Trump of “undermining rule of law.” Sarah Matthews, deputy White House press secretary during Trump’s first term, witnessed Trump staffers trying, without success, to get the president to condemn the January 6 violence. “In my eyes, it was a complete dereliction of duty that he did not uphold his oath of office,” she told USA Today. “I lost all faith in him that day” and resigned from her job. Trump’s “continuation of pushing this lie that the election is stolen has made him wholly unfit to hold office every again,” Matthews said.\n\nWhat kind of president invites the media to attend Cabinet meetings where each member is required to humiliate themselves by telling Trump how wonderful he is?\n\nBut let's give Trump some credit. He does have the kind of intelligence, sometimes called \"street smarts,\" attributed to hustlers, con men, and grifters. That seems to have worked for him.\n\nTrump knows that many Republicans in Congress laugh at him behind his back but don't say anything in public because they fear him—particularly his ability to find candidates to run against them in the GOP primaries. \n\nHe also knows that most world leaders don't respect him. We’ve now been witness to the ritualized Oval Office meetings between Trump and his counterparts, where Trump seeks to bully, coerce, and humiliate them. A few have challenged him, which gets him angry enough to seek revenge. His meetings with Putin are somewhat different, since he envies the Russian autocrat’s power. Trump’s bromance and recent break-up with Elon Musk is partly about policy but mostly a battle of egos and wills.\n\nWhat kind of person craves being famous for telling people, \"You're fired\"? But that's how he became a TV celebrity. What kind of president invites the media to attend Cabinet meetings where each member is required to humiliate themselves by telling Trump how wonderful he is? To Trump, respect is a zero-sum game. He likes to demean others to boost himself.\n\nTrump will try, and fail, to cancel the 2028 elections and remain in power. But don't expect him to fade away. He will seek to become the leader of a white nationalist supremacist movement while continuing to dominate the Republican Party. The MAGA forces he’s unleashed since 2016 will also still be around. It is no accident that racist, anti-immigrant, and anti-Semitic incidents have spiked since Trump began campaigning for president. Trump verbalizes, encourages, enables, tolerates, winks at, and makes excuses for hate groups, most notably when he said that some of the Nazis marching in Charlottesville in 2017 were “good people.”\n\nWhen Trump dies from the side effects of obesity, the nation and the world will breathe a huge sigh of relief.\n\nBut as he gets crazier and crazier, and no longer has the power of the presidency, most of his followers will abandon him, crowds at his rallies will be smaller and smaller, and he’ll become a lonely, decrepit old man, a fallen idol like the Orson Welles character (Charles Kane) in the 1941 film \"Citizen Kane\" and the Andy Griffith character (Lonesome Rhodes) in the 1957 film \"A Face in the Crowd.\" \n\nHe'll retreat to Mar-a-Lago—his Xanadu—by himself and with his paid staff. Or perhaps he'll spend much of his remaining years in federal prison, seething over how he was the victim of conspiracies.\n\nWhen Trump dies from the side effects of obesity, the nation and the world will breathe a huge sigh of relief. And while he can't quite admit it to himself, he knows it, and it terrifies him.\n\nNOW READ: Here's how Trump could be stopped in his tracks","summary":"I must admit, if Trump wasn't such a power-hungry demagogue, a danger to democracy, a sexual predator, racist, sociopath, pathological liar, bully, and impulsive and unstable megalomaniac, I might feel sorry for him.\n\nHe has no real friends, just sycophants.

Gavin Newsom (D-CA) has called a special election in November seeking voters’ approval to circumvent the state’s independent redistricting commission and allow the Democratic-led state legislature to redraw maps. A new map would likely attempt to force out Reps. Kevin Kiley (R-CA), Darrell Issa (R-CA), David Valadao (R-CA), Doug LaMalfa (R-CA), and Ken Calvert (R-CA).\n\nBut then a ruling dropped in Utah, thrusting the Beehive State into the redistricting battle erupting around the country. \n\nA district judge ruled that the Republican-controlled legislature drew districts counter to state law and ignored the independent redistricting commission established to prevent partisan gerrymandering.\n\n“Redistricting is not a mere exercise in political line-drawing; it strikes at the very heart of our democracy,” Judge Dianna M. Gibson wrote in her ruling. \n\nThe judge ordered that the map be redrawn ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. Though Utah is a predominantly Republican state that voted for President Donald Trump by over 20 points in 2024, Democrats are seeing a glimmer of hope taking root in Salt Lake County. \n\nThe area remains a Democratic stronghold that backed former Vice President Kamala Harris by 10 points last year. With the redrawing of the map, the new district boundaries could turn one of Utah’s four GOP districts into a competitive pick-up opportunity for Democrats.\n\nUtah lawmakers have until September 24 to adopt a new map, per the deadline given by the district judge. The tight turnaround could force lawmakers to consider maps proposed by the redistricting commission, including one that created a district comprised of Democrat-heavy cities such as Salt Lake City and Park City.\n\nThe Utah House member who will have the most competitive seat depends on how Salt Lake City is divided up in the new map. \n\nBefore the current boundaries were drawn in 2020, the city resided within the 4th District, which is currently represented by Rep.

If a new map reflects the old 2020 one, he is likely to have the most competitive seat, per Deseret News. \n\nIn the House, every seat matters, and flipping the chamber is Democrats’ best chance to break apart the Republican trifecta. Shifting any seats into competitive battlegrounds could threaten Republicans’ razor-thin majority in an election cycle where Trump will not be at the top of the ballot to drive turnout. \n\nDemocrats have claimed that Republicans are gerrymandering districts because the GOP would lose if the midterm elections were a referendum on Trump’s record.\n\nRepublicans have argued that the redrawing in Texas is within the rights of legislators, as the state does not have a redistricting commission. Instead, the GOP has accused California Democrats of a power grab and ignoring the will of voters by trying to circumvent the state’s commission.\n\nOther states, including Illinois, New York, Florida, Indiana, and Ohio, have also floated redistricting to try to target the opposing party in their state and boost their party’s representation on Capitol Hill.\n\nGOP Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe on Friday said he’d call state lawmakers back for a special session to look at approving a new congressional map. The Show-Me state has two Democrats in Congress and four Republicans, and a map Trump posted on social media would wipe out one Democratic seat. \n\n“I call on all of my Republican friends in the Missouri Legislature to work as fast as they can to get this new Congressional Map, AS IS, to Governor Mike Kehoe’s desk,” Trump said on Truth Social on Friday.\n\nStrategists have warned that redistricting could ultimately make Congress more partisan and eliminate centrist members, many of whom each party relies on to help find common ground and unite against contentious legislation. They’ve also cautioned that this snowballing redistricting war could result in “warped” representation and ultimately be bad for the country.\n\nTRUMP RIPS UTAH COURT ORDER TO REDRAW ELECTORAL MAP AS ‘ABSOLUTELY UNCONSTITUTIONAL’\n\nJ. Miles Coleman, an associate editor with Sabato’s Crystal Ball, related the frequency of mid-decade redistricting to the once-rare move of impeaching a president.\n\n“In this redistricting race to the bottom, because that’s kind of what it is, it almost reminds me of … the first Trump term, how he was impeached two times. It’s like, ‘Okay, well, every time we have a president of one party, is the other party going to automatically try to impeach him?’ Just because that’s something that used to be more rare, is kind of more common now.\n\n“It was still seen as almost a fringy type of thing, and I feel like it’s becoming more, not willy nilly, but more commonly talked about, at least, and this mid-decade redistricting could kind of fall into that category, as well,” Coleman added.","summary":"The red state of Utah is emerging as a rare bright spot for the Democratic Party&#8217;s redistricting wars, which have, until now, hinged on a California special election.

The last time a Democratic Presidential candidate had won Missouri was in 1996, and, this time, Donald Trump was certain to defeat Kamala Harris and lead a Republican sweep of statewide offices. Josh Hawley, the state’s senior U.S. senator, was insisting, against all evidence, that Amendment 3 wasn’t about abortion but, rather, about providing gender-affirming care to minors. He falsely called it “an effort to come into our schools, behind your backs, without your knowledge, to tell our kids that there’s something wrong with them and to give them drugs that will sterilize them for life.”\nDeborah Haller, a retired nurse, who spent nine years running the public-health department in rural Johnson County, about an hour east of Kansas City, knew that thousands of women were crossing the border into Illinois and Kansas to end their pregnancies, and that many others were securing abortion pills through telemedicine. Missouri’s restrictions were “unconscionable,” Haller told me. On Election Night, she was thrilled when 51.6 per cent of the state’s voters said yes to Amendment 3, but she soon said to her husband, “I wonder how long it’ll be before they knock it down.” Relating their conversation to me, she said, “It didn’t take long.”\nLess than twenty-four hours after the polls closed, Missouri’s two Planned Parenthood clinics filed suit, asking a court to honor the result and lift medically unnecessary abortion regulations that were on the books in the state, including a seventy-two-hour waiting period, a ban on providing abortion medication through telemedicine appointments, mandatory pelvic exams, and a requirement that clinics be licensed as ambulatory surgical centers. The limitations, in effect since 2018, had left Missouri with just one abortion clinic in the years before Dobbs. Sure enough, attorneys for the Republican-led state government objected, saying that the regulations must be enforced to protect patients.\nIt was not until February that a Kansas City judge temporarily struck most state regulations targeted at abortion providers, even as she allowed several others to remain, such as the condition that clinics fulfill the standards for ambulatory surgical centers. Three Planned Parenthood clinics began administering abortion care, but the government appealed, and the state Supreme Court halted abortions in May. The case has gone back and forth, with the judge ruling anew in July that surgical abortions can take place, for now at least, and the state, again, filing an appeal. The office of Missouri’s secretary of state has issued a rule that effectively blocks clinics from providing medication abortions, which account for nearly two-thirds of abortions nationwide. Upping the pressure, the state’s attorney general, Andrew Bailey, sued Planned Parenthood on July 23rd, calling the organization a “death factory.” (He has since been named the co-deputy director of the F.B.I.) Most troubling to abortion-rights proponents: Republicans in the Missouri legislature decided to place a new constitutional amendment on next year’s ballot which would severely restrict abortion all over again. In passing the measure, Republican legislators said that voters must not have understood what was in Amendment 3, or it surely would have been defeated.\nMissouri is not the only state where anti-abortion activists have countered post-Dobbs gains on abortion rights. In Ohio, despite a 2023 referendum that prohibits the state from “burdening, prohibiting, penalizing, and interfering with access to abortion” before viability, challenges to abortion rights are working their way through the courts. Even states with significant abortion bans are witnessing intensifying attempts to make reproductive care more challenging to obtain. Texas and Louisiana, for example, are targeting a New York doctor for allegedly violating state laws when she prescribed abortion pills to patients in their states. Louisiana passed a law last year that classifies mifepristone and misoprostol as controlled substances, potentially delaying lifesaving treatment for pregnant women and making it more difficult for them to manage miscarriages. (The law is being challenged in court; legislators in states such as Missouri have introduced similar legislation.) Candace Gibson, the director of state policy at the pro-choice Guttmacher Institute, called the prospect of such legislation “Terrifying.” She added, “Unfortunately, what type of care you can access really depends on where you live.”\nWhen I went to see Selina Sandoval, an ob-gyn at the Kansas City Planned Parenthood, the clinic was offering abortions for just the second time since the July ruling. Sandoval explained that, amid the shifting landscape, she is updated promptly by the organization’s attorney when new information comes in. “Even as someone who’s doing this care every day, it is so hard to follow what’s going on,” she told me between appointments. (She also sees patients across the state line in Kansas.)\nThe on-again, off-again access to abortions in Missouri has made it difficult for Planned Parenthood clinics to prepare for the periods when abortion has been allowed. They can’t always train and assign staff in an instant, or easily schedule doctors or spread the word that they’re open for business. The uncertainty is “really disruptive to care, which obviously is the goal,” Sandoval said. Emily Wales, the president and C.E.O. of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, which includes central and western Missouri, noted that, for years, clinics have told patients that their care may be interrupted. “We had appointments available,” she said, “but we would tell people as they booked them, ‘We have a license renewal coming up,’ or ‘We have an injunction in place that has a hearing, so let’s go ahead and create a backup plan.’ ”\nOf ten available appointments on the day I visited, only seven were filled in advance. I spoke with one patient, a twenty-eight-year-old medical assistant and mother of four young children. She had assumed that she would have to travel for treatment, as a friend had, and had been startled to discover that she could get an appointment in Kansas City. If she’d had to travel for an abortion, “it would have caused chaos in my life,” she told me. “It would have been a struggle to have to take off work, and then, on top, it’s just already overwhelming.”\nAngela Huntington spends her workdays, and many of her off-hours, creating what she calls a “soft landing” for abortion patients from Missouri and beyond. Based in Columbia, two hours east of Kansas City, Huntington is part of a network of patient “navigators” who buy plane tickets, send rideshare gift cards, reimburse hotel and child-care costs, and arrange payments for abortions that patients otherwise could not afford. In 2024, a hundred and fifty-five thousand people crossed state lines for abortions. “There’s so much meaning to what I do.” Huntington told me. “I don’t know if I could do anything else.” On the day we met, she was working with an unhoused woman who lived thirty-five miles from the nearest airport. The woman had never flown, and she was stopped by airport security because she did not have a Real I.D. or a home address that matched her proof of identification. “It’s a mess,” Huntington said.\nOne woman’s effort to get an abortion spanned five states. A nurse and mother of five girls in a small town in southern Missouri, she was delighted when she found out, earlier this year, that she was pregnant with a boy. Testing, however, soon revealed trisomy 18, a genetic abnormality that is usually fatal, often before birth. Few infants born with the condition live more than a year, and their short lives are marred by feeding and breathing difficulties and other forms of distress. The woman learned that her unborn son—whom she and her husband had named Mychael—had a particularly severe case. “We went to all the appointments. We did all the ultrasounds,” she told me. “Beyond a miracle happening, there was no way we were delivering a healthy child free of pain.”\nTroubled that her fetus might start suffering at twenty weeks or so, the woman sought an abortion. She was determined to induce labor in lieu of having a dilation-and-evacuation procedure. “I wanted to be able to deliver and hold our baby and tell him goodbye and try to let him know he was loved and wanted,” she said. But competing court rulings had left doctors and hospitals uncertain about what was legal. Her Missouri doctor did not believe that she could obtain an induction abortion in the state. She then drove to Kansas, where such an abortion is legal, but a state law prohibits some public-university hospital facilities from offering the procedure unless the woman’s life is in danger. Her doctor there conferred with hospital attorneys, in search of an exception, but found none.\nIn the end, the woman found her way to an abortion clinic far from her home town. As she and her husband drove into its parking lot, anti-abortion picketers were shouting, she recalled, saying “that I’m killing my baby, and come talk to them. And I’m screaming back, ‘My baby’s dying.’ ” Looking back, she said, “There are laws, I get that. But it’s not black and white.”\nThen, there are the Missouri women who are at risk. “We see some of the sickest of sick patients,” Valerie French, a practicing ob-gyn in Kansas City, told me. French recalled a patient from rural Missouri who had developed an ectopic pregnancy. Such pregnancies are nonviable and can be fatal to the mother. Treatment is perfectly legal, but doctors at the woman’s local hospital felt “uncomfortable and threatened and that they might go to jail,” French said. “So this patient travelled an hour and a half to Kansas for a standard ectopic pregnancy. And she was not a well-resourced person.” French described the Missouri hospital’s decision as unfortunately common. “There are not many institutions in restricted states that are comfortable or willing to jump through all of those hoops,” she said. “It is much easier to decline care than to build a legal case about why it is permitted to provide an abortion.”\nThese were the challenges that Amendment 3 was supposed to solve. The referendum entitled patients to make their own decisions about abortion until fetal viability and secured their right to an abortion at any point to protect their life or health. Some abortion supporters, however, warned that references to fetal viability gave the government too much latitude to intervene and made years of court battles inevitable. The referendum’s defenders settled on language that they deemed essential to victory in a conservative state. “We chose the position that we thought was winnable,” Wales, the Planned Parenthood Great Plains leader, said.\nEven with the less ambitious language, supporters faced obstacles to getting the referendum on the ballot. Jay Ashcroft, who was then Missouri’s secretary of state, proposed a summary for voters that asked if they wanted the constitution to “allow for dangerous, unregulated, and unrestricted abortions from conception to live birth, without requiring a medical license or potentially being subject to medical malpractice.” A court rejected Ashcroft’s language as argumentative and unfair. Also rejected were the phrases “right to life,” “partial-birth abortion,” and “unborn child.”\n“Ever since I have been involved with Missouri, it has been very hostile to women’s reproductive rights and reproductive freedom,” Robin Blake, a longtime primary-care doctor in Columbia, now retired, told me. As a medical student in St. Louis in the years before the Roe decision, Blake had counseled women to abortions that he described as safe but illegal. In the late eighties, he was one of seven plaintiffs in Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, a challenge to abortion regulations imposed by the Missouri state legislature, which was ultimately considered by the Supreme Court. Its decision, which overturned a pair of lower federal court rulings, strengthened states’ power to regulate abortion and was seen as a setback to doctors’ independence nationwide.\n“I’m eighty years old, and I’ve never been as pessimistic about the future as I am now,” Blake said. He expects the state Supreme Court to continue severely restricting abortion, and worries about threats to access nationally. “The F.D.A. may rescind its approval of mifepristone,” he said. “The U.S. Supreme Court—God knows what they are liable to do.”\nBlake predicts that the new measure, also titled Amendment 3, will be difficult to beat, unless the Missouri courts again require changes to the summary that appears on the ballot. The language approved by Republicans does not say that a yes vote would largely overturn last year’s referendum, or that it would ban most abortions. It does, however, explain that the new amendment would “prohibit surgeries, hormones, and drugs used on children for gender transitions,” despite the fact that such care was already outlawed in the state. Deborah Haller, the retired nurse, predicted that abortion foes will “make it as confusing as possible. They unfortunately have been very strategic in approaching this from multiple angles and, I’m sorry to say, very successful.” ♦","summary":"Missouri voters approved a measure to protect abortion rights, but opponents have repeatedly blocked it from taking effect.","url":"https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-lede/do-state-referendums-on-abortion-work","image":"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6887ba04ef415f1074d41b2c/16:9/w_2560,h_1440,c_limit/SLEVIN-ABORTION-2024-10-19T101257Z_1036559796_RC29NAARSMRQ_RTRMADP_3_USA-ELECTION-ABORTION-CAMPAIGNER.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-01 10:00:00","author":"Peter Slevin","authors":["Peter Slevin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.461},{"id":356344608,"title":"Did Stephen Colbert Sign Netflix Deal?

During the July 17 episode, the comedian told the studio audience that \"it's not just the end of our show, but it's the end of The Late Show on CBS.\"\"I'm not being replaced,\" he continued. \"This is all just going away.\"In a CBS press release, which was sent to Newsweek at the time, the network called Colbert \"irreplaceable\" and said he \"will be remembered in the pantheon of greats that graced late night television.\"\"This is purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night. It is not related in any way to the show's performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount,\" the statement continued. Paramount is the parent company of CBS.Those financial reasons, though, are tied to Paramount's proposed $8 billion merger with Skydance Media, which requires Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approval under the President Donald Trump's administration.Days before the cancellation announcement, Colbert blasted Paramount over its $16 million settlement with Trump, stemming from a 60 Minutes interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris.Last year, Trump accused the program of editing the interview with his election opponent in a \"deceitful\" way. The show denied that claim.What People Are SayingThe timing of The Late Show's cancellation prompted politicians and fellow late-night talk show hosts to speak out.President Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social on July 18: \"I absolutely love that Colbert got fired. His talent was even less than his ratings. I hear Jimmy Kimmel is next. Has even less talent than Colbert! Greg Gutfeld is better than all of them combined, including the Moron on NBC who ruined the once great Tonight Show.\"Senator Adam Schiff, a California Democrat who was a guest on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert the day of the announcement, wrote via X: \"Just finished taping with Stephen Colbert who announced his show was canceled. If Paramount and CBS ended the Late Show for political reasons, the public deserves to know. And deserves better.\"Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, wrote on X: \"CBS canceled Colbert's show just THREE DAYS after Colbert called out CBS parent company Paramount for its $16M settlement with Trump—a deal that looks like bribery.

My God! When CDs stopped selling, they didn't just go, 'Oh well, music, it's been a good run.' The fact that CBS didn't try to save their number one rated network late night franchise, that's been on the air for over three decades, is part of what's making everybody wonder, 'Was this purely financial or maybe the path of least resistance for your $8 billion merger?'Andy Cohen, who hosts Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen, said on SiriusXM's Andy Cohen Live in July: \"Typically what would happen if a show is losing money that is also super important to the network, which that show, and the late nighttime slot has been important to CBS for the last 25 years since Letterman began it on CBS at the Ed Sullivan Theater in like the mid-nineties, what they would probably do is say, 'Listen, Stephen, your show is losing X amount of money a year. There's two things we could do. We could cut the budget in half, maybe move out of the Ed Sullivan Theater, do the show in a small studio that we already own,' because CBS has a lot of studio space. Cut down on staff. You have 200 people working here. We needed to be 100 people or 60, and instead of you doing your show five days a week, we're gonna do your show four days a week, and you're gonna pre-tape your Thursday show, so you're actually gonna be in production three days a week. That's a way right there to cut the budget at least in half … Instead they're turning the lights out completely at 11:30, which says to me, it's like CBS is just cooked.

Donald Trump chose to celebrate this year’s edition by announcing last Thursday his unilateral abrogation of the federal government’s contracts with the unions that represent the scientists, engineers, and other staffers at NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (which includes the National Weather Service), the Patent Office, and the International Trade Administration. This follows his earlier contract terminations with the unions that represented 400,000 employees at the Department of Veterans Affairs, as well as those at the Department of Health and Human Services, and other major departments.\n\nAccording to a study from the Center for American Progress (CAP), these Trump-imposed contract nullifications have cost 81.8 percent of civilian federal workers their right to collectively bargain—and that study came out before last Thursday’s new round of government fuck-you’s to its workers. The total number of workers whose contracts Trump has trashed now exceeds one million, which comes to approximately one-fifteenth of American workers covered by a union contract. Georgetown University labor historian Joe McCartin terms this “by far the largest single action of union busting in American history.”\n\nThe largest federal worker union, the American Federation of Government Employees, has a case pending challenging Trump’s right to nullify contracts that the federal government has signed. In every instance of contract nullification, Trump has stipulated that his right to cancel is rooted in a clause stating that contracts should not extend to departments and agencies that deal with matters of national security. That’s why the CIA and Defense Department have never been unionized. But how the doctors, nurses, therapists, and social workers who care for the nation’s veterans—not to mention the park rangers who tend to Yosemite and Yellowstone, and the hundreds of thousands of other federal employees who help keep the nation running—could endanger national security in the course of their daily rounds remains unexplained.\n\nTrump’s justification raises a further question: If those million-plus workers are all engaged in matters of national security, why has Trump laid off so many of them? This is a circle that resists squaring.\n\nWOULD THAT THIS CONSTITUTED THE WHOLE of Trump’s war on organized labor. It doesn’t. Seven days after he took the oath of office, Trump fired National Labor Relations Board member Gwynne Wilcox, despite the fact that under the terms of the National Labor Relations Act, which stipulates that each of the five board members is to serve for five years, her term was not to end until August 2028. The NLRA narrowly limits the president’s power over the Board; his sole power is to nominate members, who must be confirmed by the Senate, and who can only be removed by the president for dereliction of duty or malfeasance in office, neither of which Trump even alleged as cause for Wilcox’s dismissal.\n\nIn fact, he failed to specify any reason for his action, though the effect was to reduce Board membership to a bare two—not enough to constitute a quorum. And while Trump and Senate Republicans have eagerly installed replacements for most of the department and agency officials he’s sacked, no such rush has been evident at the NLRB. So there it sits, powerless to rule on questions pertaining to violations and abuses of, or compliance with, workers’ rights on the job, even though it’s the sole government agency that has that power. Most of the agency’s duties and cases that arise can be settled by the Board’s regional staffs (which run union certification elections and investigate alleged “unfair labor practices”) and by its administrative judges, who rule on cases brought by employees, employers, or Board staff. Their rulings can be appealed to the Board, which then issue decisions that can affect workers’ rights broadly.\n\nDuring Joe Biden’s presidency, the Board (which has always been composed of three members from the president’s party and two from the opposition party) significantly enhanced workers’ rights: forbidding “captive audience” meetings in which employers compel their employees to attend sessions of anti-union propaganda; requiring employers to recognize a union with which a majority of their workers have signed affiliation cards; and forbidding noncompete clauses through which employers keep their workers from moving to new jobs in the same field. If the two nominees for Board seats that Trump has sent to the Senate are confirmed—and this process is moving at a glacial pace—the Board will again have a quorum and those Biden Board rulings are almost certain to be reversed. Also on the chopping block would be a 2016 Board decision classifying graduate students at private colleges and universities who work as teaching and research assistants as employees, and thereby entitled to form unions and bargain with management. (Prospect writing fellow James Baratta has a piece about the grad students’ future on our site today.)\n\nTrump-imposed contract nullifications have cost at least 81 percent of civilian federal workers their right to collectively bargain.\n\nBut even without Trump’s nominees, the current quorum-less Board poses an obstacle to workers seeking the enforcement of their rights. Amazon, a fanatically anti-union employer, has gone to court challenging the unionization of workers at a Whole Foods store in Philadelphia (Amazon owns Whole Foods; the workers at that store voted 130-100 to unionize) because the Board lacks a quorum and Amazon will not accept the authority of the Board’s regional director to certify the vote. Even without such dubious accusations as Amazon’s, the Board is plainly MIA when it comes to setting policy. As a recent study from the Hamilton Project pointed out, “Between the first month with a Board decision (December 1935) and December 2024, there were only four months in which the NLRB published no decisions … Between January and July of this year, there have been five.”\n\nThe Board faces greater challenges than its current relegation to quorum-less nonentity. Amazon, along with SpaceX and a few other companies, is currently in federal court arguing that the Board itself is unconstitutional, because the limits imposed on presidential power over independent federal regulatory agencies violate the “unitary executive” doctrine that all federal agencies should be subject to presidential control, despite their establishment as independent agencies by Congress and presidents. The constitutionality of the Board, which was created to administer the worker rights enshrined in the NLRA in 1935, was upheld by the Supreme Court in 1937, and it has issued tens of thousands of rulings for and against employees and employers in the nine decades since without ever having its constitutionality successfully challenged. Earlier this month, however, the federal appellate court in the Fifth Circuit—the most right-wing set of judges since the Inquisition—held it to be unconstitutional on those grounds, in anticipation of a ruling from the six Republican justices on the Supreme Court that would strike down the independence of such agencies and boards.\n\nShould the Court rule that way, as is widely expected, Trump would have the power to discharge the remaining Democrat on the Board and appoint all five members. The practical difference between having a 3-to-2 majority on the Board and having a 5-to-0 supermajority may not be all that great. As Harvard Law professor Ben Sachs told me, “What really matters is who has the three votes. It won’t be all that different if the vote is 5-to-0 rather than 3-to-2. But if the Court gives the president the right to discharge any member whose opinion even on a run-of-the-mill case displeases him, that does matter. In those circumstances, no one could trust that the Board’s decision-making would really be based in law.”\n\nHistorically, states and localities have been blocked from making laws dealing with private-sector workers’ collective-bargaining rights; the NLRA reserves such matters to the federal government. That preemption, Sachs told me, is rooted in the principle of deference to the federal agency assigned to the task by law: in this case, the NLRB. However, Sachs said, “if the agency is not operating as Congress intended, those preemption rules ought to give way.”\n\nIf the Board is to be without a quorum for a prolonged period of time, that could open the door to states controlled by pro-labor liberals to challenge federal preemption by enacting collective-bargaining statutes of their own. As the NLRA doesn’t extend those rights to public employees or farm or domestic workers, a number of those states have extended those rights to those groups of workers since the 1960s (in the case of public employees), the 1970s (in the case of California farmworkers), and the past two decades (when some states have enacted “bill of rights” legislation for domestic workers). Should the Board reverse its 2016 ruling that extended those rights to grad students at private universities, Rhode Island has already enacted a law granting those rights to its state’s grad students, as James Baratta reports.\n\nBut foreseeing a Trump Board that undermines the very rights and protections for workers that the Board was established to protect, some blue states are currently considering whether they can supplant the Board more fully. A bill pending in the Massachusetts legislature would have the state claim jurisdiction over private-sector workers if the NLRB remains powerless for lack of a quorum. A bill sitting on New York Gov. Kathy Hochul’s desk would enable the state to enact collective-bargaining rights for private-sector workers thwarted by the NLRB’s incapacity to act; it would require the Board to go to court to reclaim jurisdiction. A bill introduced in the California legislature would go so far as to give the state the jurisdiction the Board currently wields over private-sector workers if the Board should lose its independent status by virtue of a Supreme Court ruling finding that status unconstitutional. Suffice it to say that such a bill, if enacted, would prompt some serious challenges.\n\nWhat’s behind Trump’s union busting? At one level, he wants to destroy unions simply because they oppose him; opposition is all it takes for Trump to order a hit. At a deeper level, unions are a voice from below, and their autonomy poses a threat to autocrats. Even enfeebled unions have the potential to reawaken and join a battle to thwart despots. It’s no accident that every Western democracy has had—at one time, at least—a powerful union movement; just as it’s no accident that no autocracy—and no aspiring autocrat like Trump—can tolerate one. A core part of Hitler’s seizure of total power was the utter destruction of the German labor movement.\n\nIF I’VE DWELT MORE ON WHAT TRUMP is doing to unions than on what unions are doing themselves, that’s because, like every other American institution, unions have been overwhelmed by Trump’s onslaughts. They enter the fray from positions of both weakness and strength. While union members still constitute about one-third of the nation’s public employees, the near-pathological opposition to unions from American employers, abetted by the erosion of labor law protections, has reduced the union share of the private-sector workforce to just 6 percent. Nor do the nation’s union members constitute a blue wall. In the 2024 presidential election, a majority of blue-collar union members preferred Trump to Kamala Harris, while white-collar and female members preferred Harris. (The two unions that are home to the largest number of both white-collar and female members—the American Federation of Teachers and the National Education Association—have played key roles in the nationwide anti-Trump “No Kings” demonstrations.) The political divide within the American electorate—non-college voters aligning with Republicans, college graduates aligning with Democrats—is present within the nation’s labor movement, too. If Democrats and unions can’t win back the working class, the prospects for a Democratic victory so large that it could finally rebuild an NLRA with the power to revive workers’ rights are dimmer than dim.\n\nThat said, labor has retained and even enhanced one form of strength: Today, in this populist age, unions are the only American institution whose popularity has been steadily rising, winning 68 percent approval ratings in Gallup’s polling. The gap between that level of approval and the 6 percent unionized share of private-sector workers, however, illustrates how completely the rickety remains of labor law have failed to enable a pro-labor workforce to go union—despite the best, though short-lived, efforts of Biden’s NLRB, and even before the havoc that second-term Trump has inflicted on unions. The 2026 elections may afford unions an opportunity to arrest some of Trump’s attacks; the 2028 elections, an opportunity to reverse them. Even then, the road to re-establishing workers’ rights will be steep.","summary":"His unbound union busting is one front of his war on democracy.","url":"https://prospect.org/labor/2025-09-01-trump-celebrates-labor-day-as-most-anti-union-president/","image":"https://prospect.org/downloads/23451/download/Meyerson-Labor%20Day%20090125.jpg?cb=0f3e036b2c22b78a68a4c0924ef3f898&w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-01 09:15:00","author":"Harold Meyerson","authors":["Harold Meyerson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.076},{"id":356331146,"title":"Rosie O’Donnell apologizes for calling trans Minneapolis Catholic school shooter a MAGA supporter: ‘I messed up’","text":"Rosie O’Donnell is eating her words after she falsely claimed that the transgender Minneapolis Catholic school shooter was a MAGA supporter in a hate-fueled social media rant last week.\n\nThe former talk show host and fierce Trump critic, 63, who resides in Ireland after fleeing the US over the commander in chief’s second term in office, dangerously suggested that shooter Robin Westman — who killed two children and injured 18 parishioners — was a “Republican, MAGA person, white supremacist” in a TikTok rant.\n\nAfter realizing that her conspiracy-laden tirade on social media was factually incorrect, O’Donnell took to social media to issue a groveling apology.\n\n“I know a lot of you were very upset about the video I made before I went away for a few days,” she said in a TikTok video shared Sunday. “You are right and I did not do my due diligence before I made that emotional statement.”\n\n“I said things about the shooter that were incorrect,” O’Donnell continued. “I assumed, like most shooters, they followed a standard MO and had standard feelings of you know, NRA-loving kind of gun people.”\n\n“The truth is, I messed up and when you mess up, you fess up.

Additionally, a vast majority of Democrats expect to be worse off financially a year from now, while a slim majority of Republicans believe they will be better off.\n\nOf the 840 respondents, 44% said they align most with Democrats, 38% with Republicans and 19% with independents. Of them, 51% said they voted for Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, while 45% said they voted for Donald Trump.\n\nThat mirrors the results of the election, where 52.4% of Mainers’ votes went to Harris and 45.5% to Trump.\n\nThe roughly 2,600 members of the Pine Tree State panel were invited to complete the survey online Aug. 14-18.

About 61% of those who expect prices to increase said tariffs are a factor in their belief, while 37% of those expecting a decrease cite tariffs as well.\n\nOther prevalent reasons for those who expect a decline in prices were good economic stewardship (20%), lower interest rates (17%) and lower energy prices (8%). Other reasons cited for people expecting price increases include poor economic stewardship (11%) and general inflation (7%).\n\nOverall, the majority of respondents (53%), regardless of political party, believe the economy is getting worse, while just 38% of Mainers feel the economy is getting better.\n\nHowever, when broken down by party, only 6% of Republicans surveyed feel the economy is getting worse compared to 90% of Democrats and 54% of independents. The vast majority of Republicans (80%) believe the economy is getting better, but only 32% of Independents and 5% of Democrats agree.\n\nPERSONAL FINANCE\n\nWhile only 19% of the respondents said their household is better off financially than a year ago, 44% think their finances are about the same but 37% believe they are worse off. Roughly 54% of independents, 42% of Democrats and 26% of Republicans say they are worse off.\n\nThe survey also looked at whom respondents voted for in 2024.\n\nAbout 45% of Trump voters and 44% of Harris voters say they are doing about the same financially as they were a year ago. However, 27% of Trump voters said they are doing better, compared to 12% of Harris voters. Meanwhile, 44% of Harris voters said they are worse off than they were this time last year, compared to 28% of Trump voters.\n\nAnswers also varied by household income.\n\nWhile 44% of all respondents said their financial condition is about the same as it was a year ago, 62% of those with an annual household income of $100,000 or greater feel they are better off than a year ago, but just 40% of households making less than $100,000 feel the same.\n\nOnly 4% of households making $45,000 to $75,000 annually feel as though they are better off. Just under half (49%) of people in that income bracket say they are worse off than a year ago, and 47% say they are doing about the same.\n\nLooking ahead, 45% of respondents — including 74% of Democrats and 48% of independents — believe they will be worse off financially a year from now. Just 27% — but the majority (59%) of Republicans — expect they will be better off.\n\nWhether respondents are optimistic or pessimistic about their economic futures is also heavily rooted in who they voted for, according to the survey results.\n\nMore than half of Trump voters (55%) expect to be better off in a year, while only 4% of Harris voters feel the same.

Jean Carroll's lawsuits.On May 12, 2023, a Manhattan jury of nine men and three women found Trump liable for sexually abusing and defaming Carroll and awarded her $5 million in damages.The president was found liable for battery, a civil tort, based on the preponderance of evidence provided by Carroll that he sexually abused her, but not that he raped her.The settlement terms required ABC News to publish a note on its website expressing regret over the claim and to pay $1 million in legal fees to Trump's attorneys.The Sunday criticism of ABC was the president's second major attack on the network in a week.The previous Sunday, he called the ABC and NBC networks two of the \"most biased\" broadcasters ever and said the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) should revoke their licenses.What People are SayingIn the ABC discussion of the economy, Donna Brazile said: \"These tariffs have created a level of uncertainty that the American people can't afford. Donald Trump won on affordability, he won on lowering costs and people are paying higher prices at the grocery store and in getting their kids back to school than ever before.

Awarded during the covid-19 pandemic, they supported efforts to vaccinate people, reduce health disparities among demographic groups, upgrade antiquated systems for detecting infectious disease outbreaks, and hire community health workers.\n\nInitially, grant cancellations hit blue and red states roughly evenly. Four of the five jurisdictions with the largest number of terminated grants were led by Democrats: California, the District of Columbia, Illinois, and Massachusetts.\n\nBut after attorneys general and governors from about two dozen blue states sued in federal court and won an injunction, the balance flipped. Of the five states with the most canceled grants, four are led by Republicans: Texas, Georgia, Oklahoma, and Ohio.\n\nIn blue states, nearly 80% of the CDC grant cuts have been restored, compared with fewer than 5% in red states, according to the KFF Health News analysis. Grant amounts reported in an HHS database known as the Tracking Accountability in Government Grants System, or TAGGS, often don’t match what states confirmed. Instead, this analysis focused on the number of grants.\n\nThe divide is an example of the polarization that permeates health care issues, in which access to safety-net health programs, abortion rights, and the ability of public health officials to respond to disease threats diverge significantly depending on the political party in power.\n\nIn an emailed statement, HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said the agency “is committed to protecting the health of every American, regardless of politics or geography. These funds were provided in response to the COVID pandemic, which is long over. We will continue working with states to strengthen public health infrastructure and ensure communities have the tools they need to respond to outbreaks and keep people safe.”\n\nThe money in question wasn’t spent solely on covid-related activities, public health experts say; it was also used to bolster public health infrastructure and help contain many types of viruses and diseases, including the flu, measles, and RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus.\n\nRelated | Slashed federal funding cancels vaccine clinics amid measles surge\n\n“It really supported infrastructure across the board, particularly in how states respond to public health threats,” said Susan Kansagra, chief medical officer of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.\n\nThe Trump cutbacks came as the U.S. recorded its largest measles outbreak in over three decades and 266 pediatric deaths during the most recent flu season — the highest reported outside of a pandemic since 2004. Public health departments canceled vaccine clinics, laid off staff, and put contracts on hold, health officials said in interviews.\n\nAfter its funding cuts were blocked in court, California retained every grant the Trump administration attempted to claw back, while Texas remains the state with the most grants terminated, with at least 30. As the CDC slashed grants in Texas, its measles outbreak spread across the U.S. and Mexico, sickening at least 4,500 people and killing at least 16.\n\nColorado, which joined the lawsuit, had 11 grant terminations at first, but then 10 were retained. Meanwhile, its neighboring states that didn't sue — Wyoming, Utah, Kansas, Nebraska, and Oklahoma — collectively lost 55 grants, with none retained.\n\nIn Jackson, Ohio, a half-dozen community health workers came to work one day in March to find the Trump administration had canceled their grant five months early, leaving the Jackson County Health Department half a million dollars short — and them without jobs.\n\n“I had to lay off three employees in a single day, and I haven’t had to do that before. We don’t have those people doing outreach in Jackson County anymore,” Health Commissioner Kevin Aston said.\n\nAt one point, he said, the funding helped 11 Appalachian Ohio counties. Now it supports one.\n\nMarsha Radabaugh, one employee who was reassigned, has scaled back her community health efforts: She’d been helping serve hot meals to homeless people and realized that many clients couldn’t read or write, so she brought forms for services such as Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to their encampment in a local park and helped fill them out.\n\n“We would find them rehab places. We’d get out hygiene kits, blankets, tents, zero-degree sleeping bags, things like that,” she said. As a counselor, she’d also remind people “that they're cared for, that they're worthy of being a human — because, a lot of the time, they're not treated that way.”\n\nSasha Johnson, who led the community health worker program, said people like Radabaugh “were basically a walking human 411,” offering aid to those in need.\n\nRadabaugh also partnered with a food bank to deliver meals to homebound residents.\n\nAston said the abrupt way they lost the funds — which meant the county unexpectedly had to pay unemployment for more people — could have ruined the health district financially. Canceling funding midcycle, he said, “was really scary.”\n\nHHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist and promoter of vaccine misinformation, has called the CDC a “cesspool of corruption.” At HHS, he has taken steps to undermine vaccination in the U.S. and abroad.\n\nFederal CDC funding accounts for more than half of state and local health department budgets, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. States that President Donald Trump won in the 2024 election received a higher share of the $15 billion the CDC allocated in fiscal 2023 than those that Democrat Kamala Harris won, according to KFF.\n\nThe Trump administration’s nationwide CDC grant terminations reflect this. More than half were in states that Trump won in 2024, totaling at least 370 terminations before the court action, according to KFF Health News’ analysis.\n\nThe Columbus, Ohio, health department had received $6.2 million in CDC grants, but roughly half of it — $3 million — disappeared with the Trump cuts. The city laid off 11 people who worked on investigating infectious disease outbreaks in such places as schools and nursing homes, Columbus Health Commissioner Mysheika Roberts said.\n\nShe also said the city had planned to buy a new electronic health record system for easier access to patients’ hospital records — which could improve disease detection and provide better treatment for those infected — but that was put on ice.\n\n“We’ve never had a grant midcycle just get pulled from us for no reason,” Roberts said. “This sense of uncertainty is stressful.”\n\nColumbus did not receive its money directly from the CDC. Rather, the state gave the city some funds it received from the federal government. Ohio, led by Republican Gov. Mike DeWine and a Republican attorney general, did not sue to block the funding cuts.\n\nColumbus sued the federal government in April to keep its money, along with other Democratic-led municipalities in Republican-governed states: Harris County, Texas, home to Houston; the Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County in Tennessee; and Kansas City, Missouri. A federal judge in June blocked those cuts.\n\nAs of mid-August, Columbus was awaiting the funds. Roberts said the city won’t rehire staff because the federal funding was expected to end in December.\n\nJoe Grogan, a senior scholar at the University of Southern California’s Schaeffer Institute and former director of the White House Domestic Policy Council in Trump’s first term, said state and local agencies “are not entitled” to the federal money, which was awarded “to deal with an emergency” that has ended.\n\n“We were throwing money out the door the last five years,” Grogan said of the federal government. “I don’t understand why there would ever be a controversy in unspent covid money coming back.”\n\nKen Gordon, Ohio Department of Health spokesperson, wrote in an email that the $250 million in grants lost had helped with, among other things, upgrading the disease reporting system and boosting public health laboratory testing.\n\nSome of the canceled HHS funding wasn’t slated to end for years, including four grants to strengthen public health in Indian Country, a grant to a Minnesota nonprofit focused on reducing substance use disorders, and a few to universities about occupational safety, HIV, tuberculosis, and more.\n\nBrent Ewig, chief policy and government relations officer for the Association of Immunization Managers, said the cuts were “the predictable result of ‘boom, bust, panic, neglect’ funding” for public health.\n\nThe association represents 64 state, local, and territorial immunization programs, which Ewig said will be less prepared to respond to disease outbreaks, including measles.\n\n“The system is blinking red,” Ewig said.\n\nMethodology\n\nKFF Health News’ analysis of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention grants sought to answer four questions: 1) How many grants have been terminated in the U.S. under the Trump administration since March? 2) Which states saw the most grants cut? 3) What were the grants for? and 4) Did the grant terminations affect blue, red, and purple states differently? This follows a similar analysis by KFF Health News for an article on nationwide NIH grant terminations.\n\nOur primary data source was a Department of Health and Human Services website showing grant terminations. We compared an initial list of grant terminations from April 3 with one from July 11 to determine how many grants had been restored. The USAspending.gov database helped us track grants by state.\n\nTo classify states politically, we followed the same steps from our April coverage of National Institutes of Health grant terminations. States were “blue” if Democrats had complete control of the state government or if the majority of voters favored Democratic presidential candidates in the last three elections (2016, 2020, 2024). “Red” states were classified similarly with respect to the Republican Party. “Purple” states had politically split state governments and/or were generally considered to be presidential election battleground states. The result was 25 red states, 17 blue states, and eight purple states. The District of Columbia was classified as blue using similar methods.\n\nThis analysis does not account for potential grant reinstatements in local jurisdictions where the funds were awarded indirectly rather than directly from the CDC; it accounts only for the recipients’ location, and excludes grants terminated from Compacts of Free Association states and other foreign entities that received grants directly from the CDC. At least 40 CDC grants were terminated that were meant for global health efforts or assisting public health activities in other nations following the Trump administration’s order for the CDC to withdraw support for the World Health Organization.","summary":"By Henry Larweh and Rachana Pradhan and Rae Ellen Bichell for KFF Health News\n\n\n\n\nThe Trump administration’s cuts to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention funding for state and local health departments had vastly uneven effects depending on the political leanings of a state, according to a KFF Health News analysis.

Indeed, Trump has shown that black lives matter to him.\n\n“President Trump is sending us down a really dark authoritarian path with a lot of the things that he’s doing, and we’re going to look back on this time as one of the dark times in American history,” the singer exclaimed.\n\n“I think it’s on all of us, great artists that I look up to like Stevie Wonder, like Marvin Gaye, like Aretha Franklin, like Nina Simone, like Harry Belafonte, they all use their platforms to try to make the world better.

That’s the question that Trump haters have been asking as they’ve suddenly turned to armchair medical analysis – their latest great hope.\n\nIt all kicked off with some recent shots of the back of Trump’s hands covered in poorly blended women’s makeup, ostensibly covering some bruising. Social media has been rife with amateur sleuths manipulating the contrast on the images in an attempt to determine whether there are any signs of intravenous puncture that could perhaps be indicative of a serious medical condition – like heart failure. As supporting evidence, they also cite recent shots of his swollen ankles – or “cankles” – debating whether they’re expanding and contracting like an accordion, and if so, what that means for the number of days that he has left, both in power and in life.\n\nTikTok in particular has given rise to a whole new category of content called “hopecore,” with Trump haters citing medical or medical-adjacent experience in publishing content opining about how Trump’s days are numbered – although there’s usually much debate over exactly how many.\n\nThat uncertainty is a source of great frustration for commenters seeking certainty in nailing down the exact amount of time that they have to put up with him. Some even keep spreadsheets, charts, and countdown clocks like they’re managing fantasy football teams, except instead of touchdowns they’re tracking anatomical anomalies.\n\nThe White House has openly commented on Trump’s “chronic venous insufficiency,” which would explain the bruising and swelling. But even before that, back in June, his appearance at a UFC fighting event led to much zooming in on the crotch area of this 79-year-old man, with some speculating that he was wearing a catheter. Others argued that it was just something in his pocket. Some internet detectives even claimed it was a subtle Olympic-level flex that defies both anatomy and comprehension.\n\nWhy is this even a thing, though? I guess gossip and speculation makes politics accessible for those who prefer the entry bar to be at floor-level. Policy and issues are complex and require work, particularly when the objective is to eject someone from power. It’s much more fun to just place all hope in fate to do the heavy lifting for you. And to cheer it along on a daily basis with your like-minded tribe. Add a hashtag, a TikTok filter, and suddenly it’s an entire movement. One that doesn’t even require you to get off the couch to make you feel like you’re part of something big – like a child tugging an escalator handrail convinced they’re moving everyone to the top.\n\nGuess they’re now putting all their hope on the Grim Reaper to take Trump out. Assassins failed to do it with actual bullets. Impeachment didn’t stick. Not even his disqualification through the courts came through for them. The Grim Reaper is now effectively their candidate of choice, and they seem more psyched about him than they ever did about Kamala Harris or Joe Biden.\n\nGo figure that there’s a glaring overlap between these people and those who also glom onto every health-related tidbit about Russian President Vladimir Putin. Over the years, it’s been reported in Western publications that he’s suffered from strokes, Parkinson’s, “terminal” pancreatic cancer (over a decade ago), thyroid cancer, and leprosy. Again, basically a fantasy football roster of health crises, all projected onto one man.\n\nIt’s hardly a coincidence that many of those conjuring up death fantasies also happen to be proponents of regime change, including former MI6 officer Christopher Steele, former CIA officer Ralph Goff, Danish intelligence sources, Kremlin critic Valery Solovei, or former Ukrainian intelligence chief Kirill Budanov. All waiting for Mother Nature to spring into action like she’s on USAID payroll.\n\nWhen Putin and Trump were together in Alaska recently for Ukraine peace talks, it was a double whammy field day for the death pool watchers. They glommed onto Trump’s somewhat non-linear walk down the tarmac’s red carpet to greet Putin as “proof” of his ongoing decline. Then their radar went off again when Putin shifted his weight from one leg to the other while chatting with Trump. Evidence that he was about to collapse, surely! If not immediately, then imminently!\n\nIt’s a classic case of anxiety displacement. Instead of grappling with why a political leader has power or support, they funnel their unease into scrutinizing movements, coughs, or missed steps. The result is a culture of obsessive speculation where nothing is sacred – not posture, not hands, not ankles, and certainly not the crotch region.\n\nBut the more interesting question is why exactly do they feel the need to take refuge in this kind of nonsense? It represents a super low-effort power grab. Fate does the heavy lifting and clears the way for their preferred alternative over which they feel they have more control. There seems to be a lot of projection going on, though – the mistaken belief that what comes after would be more aligned with their interests. Or that the eradication of a particular leader through natural biological processes would somehow shift the tectonic plates of the political landscape. History shows that this is hardly ever the case. Just ask all the folks in Che Guevara or Martin Luther King t-shirts.\n\nTrumpism won’t end with Trump. Nor will the growing appetite for institutional reform of Washington. So then what’s the plan? To start all over again with a J.D. Vance death watch? At this point, someone should probably invent an app to track ankle swelling and gait analytics in real time. Because if you’re too lazy or inept to win, you can at least obsess over your opponent’s every micro-movement.","summary":"Assassins failed to take the Orange Man out. Impeachment didn’t stick.

He attacked “DEI nonsense,” compared Black Lives Matter to ISIS and declared the 2020 election was “stolen from President Trump and America!”\n\nIn January, Terrell was rewarded for his loyalty when President-elect Trump, praising him as a “highly respected civil rights attorney and political analyst” with an “incredibly successful career,” named him senior counsel to the assistant attorney general for civil rights in the Justice Department. Terrell assumed his marquee role a month later: as head of the multiagency Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism.\n\nAs a Black, Christian former Democrat with little previous engagement with Jewish causes, Terrell, now 70, seemed an improbable pick to lead the effort to “root out anti-Semitic harassment in schools and on college campuses,” as the task force announcement put it. But his zealous conversion and penchant for media bombast made him a perfect bullhorn for the task force’s actual mission: to strong-arm colleges into stripping away any vestige of “wokeness” in their hiring, admissions, classes and research.\n\nIn service of that goal, the government has abandoned due process in favor of media warfare, preemptive declarations of guilt and freezes on billions in critical federal funding.\n\nTerrell has become an invaluable player in this extraordinary pressure campaign. Before most of the task force’s investigations had even launched, he publicly promised “massive lawsuits” against “Jew-hating” universities, including Harvard, the University of California, Los Angeles and dozens of others.\n\nSo far, the campaign has been effective. To preserve hundreds of millions of dollars in federal grants and contracts, Columbia and Brown have struck deals with the administration that cost them $220 million and $50 million, respectively, and go far beyond pledging tougher action to combat antisemitism. Columbia agreed to open academic programs and admissions decisions to outside monitoring. Brown pledged to ban transgender women from single-sex spaces and women’s sports. Harvard has sued the administration to try to unfreeze $2.6 billion in federal research funds, but it’s also trying to negotiate a settlement. Meanwhile, colleges nationwide are eliminating any remaining vestiges of diversity, equity and inclusion programs and shuttering multicultural centers lest the government come after them.\n\nAmid the upheaval Trump’s task force has helped to sow, the history, motivations and behavior of its blustery leader have gone largely unexamined. ProPublica and The Chronicle of Higher Education interviewed dozens of people whose paths have intersected with Terrell’s and reviewed thousands of pages of court documents and financial records related to his career and life.\n\nThe portrait that emerged is dramatically at odds with Trump’s description of a “highly respected” and “incredibly successful” attorney. Peers in civil rights law said they always considered Terrell a minor player. Documents reveal a distinctly mixed legal track record, marred by malpractice suits, client disputes and mishandling a criminal case so badly that a federal appeals court lambasted his work as “woeful.”\n\nUntil his MAGA conversion, Terrell was beset by a litany of financial troubles, including nearly $400,000 in unpaid federal taxes, a personal bankruptcy filing and a trail of court judgments and liens brought by small businesses that worked for his law firm.\n\nCurrent and former lawyers at the Justice Department say Terrell is less engaged with assessing cases or negotiating settlements than he is with scaring universities into submission. They say he’s voiced open disdain for what he calls “lawyer talk,” berating career staff who try to follow proper procedures for investigating civil rights complaints.\n\nDespite his appetite for media attention, Terrell has volunteered little about himself. Friends and neighbors recall him walking a dog and bicycling and his fondness for golf. In the “about the author” section for a self-published book, he wrote: “In his spare time, Mr. Terrell likes to work. His hobbies are work and working.”\n\nTerrell declined an interview request for this story and did not respond to written questions. In a brief phone conversation with a reporter, he explained, “I don’t do interviews with my life.” Told some details of our reporting, he added, “I’m not going to comment on anything,” and, finally, “I’m going to hang up respectfully.”\n\nIt is unclear whether Terrell’s previous troubles turned up in administration vetting for his current job. Officials at the Justice Department and White House did not respond to questions about Terrell’s role or his background.\n\nJewish activists are divided on Terrell’s approach, with some lauding it for rooting out anti-Jewish sentiment that emerged on campuses during pro-Palestinian protests and others bemoaning how he’s weaponized antisemitism.\n\nKenneth Marcus, an Education Department official in the first Trump administration who has spent years agitating for stronger federal action against campus antisemitism, is a fan. “What the president has gotten in Terrell,” Marcus said, “is someone with unique skills in delivering public messaging.”\n\nThat messaging is camouflage, according to Amy Spitalnick, CEO of the Jewish Council for Public Affairs, a national network of Jewish groups. “No one should be under any illusion that this is about keeping Jewish students or faculty safe,” she said. “Gutting cancer and Alzheimer’s research does nothing to keep them safe.”\n\nTerrell grew up in Carson, in south Los Angeles County, the fourth of seven siblings. Law was his second career, following a decade as a history and economics teacher in the Los Angeles public schools. He graduated from UCLA School of Law in 1990 and opened his own civil rights firm in Beverly Hills.\n\nAlmost immediately, Terrell began making a name for himself as a media personality with a decidedly progressive voice, becoming better known for his TV and radio commentary than for his courtroom achievements.\n\nStarting in 1991, after the police beating of a Black man, Rodney King, Terrell became a regular on local and national TV and radio condemning police brutality and racial injustice. Three years later, he snagged his breakthrough commentating gig: as a friend and supporter of O.J. Simpson. Terrell’s role as a Simpson trial analyst produced a green-room friendship with Larry Elder, a conservative Black radio host in Los Angeles, who helped Terrell land his own talk show. “I thought he was smart, feisty, opinionated and entertaining,” Elder recalled. “I thought he would be good radio, despite my disagreement with virtually everything he stood for at the time.”\n\nTerrell became a prized guest on Fox News. He spoke fast and loud, uttered every view with absolute certainty and was quick to interrupt, shout and attack, accusing one guest of tailoring his views “to make a name for himself” and another of trying to “hustle people to make money.” Pressed during one “Hannity” interview to say on air whether Simpson was guilty of murder, Terrell ripped off his ear piece and stormed out of the studio.\n\nProminent Los Angeles lawyers said he was never a big player in the city’s civil rights community. Carl Douglas, part of the Simpson defense team, said “Leo was always a talker,” not “a baller.” Connie Rice, former western regional counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, said Terrell “was never at the table for the big cases that made impact. He loved holding press conferences.”\n\nTerrell represented a Black teenager who’d been expelled from a Los Angeles high school for punching a white referee during a football game after the referee allegedly had directed racial epithets at him. He took up the cause of a mentally ill, homeless Black woman who’d been fatally shot by LA police after she wielded a 12-inch screwdriver at officers wanting to question whether she’d stolen a shopping cart. (No criminal charges were brought against the officers, but Terrell won a $975,000 settlement for her family.)\n\nNow scornful of “woke” practices and bias claims, Terrell once represented himself in a race-discrimination case against a parking company after a garage attendant refused to honor his free-parking validation from a shopping mall and told him he owed $10. A supervisor let Terrell leave without paying, but he still sued, saying he was singled out for being Black and demanding damages for “humiliation, mental anguish and severe emotional distress.” The suit was later settled for a confidential amount. Reached three decades later, an attorney for the parking company called Terrell’s lawsuit “absurd — the worst discrimination case I’ve ever seen.”\n\nTerrell always had side gigs: he self-published a book on workplace rights; he offered business consultations, corporate training seminars and mediations; he had a 900 number that charged $5 for the first minute and $2 for each additional minute for legal consultations.\n\nIn 2001, he ran unsuccessfully first for Congress, then two years later for Los Angeles City Council. He routinely promoted himself as “an NAACP attorney,” though the group said he’d never been employed there.\n\nWilliam Bloch, a veteran Los Angeles lawyer who brought two malpractice cases against Terrell, said Terrell acted as “the carnival barker” to attract business, then failed to do the necessary legal work. In one sex-discrimination case, according to the resulting malpractice suit brought by Bloch, Terrell accepted a settlement from the city of Beverly Hills for “a pittance” despite explicit instructions from his client, a female police officer, to zealously pursue her claim. Bloch persuaded an appeals court to undo the settlement. After the officer received a $100,000 award, plus money for attorney fees and costs, she dropped the case against Terrell. In the second matter, a jail employee for the city of Beverly Hills said she paid $6,000 to retain Terrell in 2009 after he “boasted of huge verdicts and settlements,” only to have him accept a $1,000 settlement from the city without her permission. According to her claim, Terrell conducted “little or no discovery, including taking no depositions.” The case was settled for a confidential amount, with no acknowledgement by Terrell of wrongdoing.\n\nIn court filings, Terrell denied any negligence or responsibility for harm to his clients, insisting they had approved all of his actions and saying lawyers are “not a guarantor of the results of any professional services.”\n\n“He’s a discredit to the legal profession,” Bloch said.\n\nA low point in Terrell’s legal career began in October 2009, when he was retained by the parents of Emond Logan, a 48-year-old California truck driver alleged to have transported more than a ton of cocaine to western Michigan as part of a multistate drug conspiracy.\n\nTerrell rarely took on criminal cases, but he’d played Little League baseball with Logan, whose family approached him after hearing his radio show. Terrell demanded a $100,000 retainer. To pay it, Logan’s father sold much of his stock from more than 30 years at Pacific Bell Telephone and borrowed money from his daughter.\n\nLogan faced overwhelming evidence: a leader of the drug gang had testified against him, and the arresting agents had seized five cars (including a Maserati), three Rolex watches and a $125,000 diamond ring, items well beyond his truck-driving income. His court-appointed lawyer had negotiated a plea agreement capping Logan’s prison time at 10 years.\n\nStill, Terrell urged Logan to blow up his “bullshit” deal, according to transcripts of their recorded jailhouse calls and Logan’s later testimony. Logan followed Terrell’s advice, despite prosecution warnings that such relatively generous terms would be off the table. Terrell arranged for Logan’s pretrial release on bond. Four months later, Logan was back in custody after a government informant taped him threatening to kill his federal prosecutor. Terrell then urged him to accept a new plea offer, with no cap, and Logan was sentenced to 35 years in prison.\n\nTerrell “didn’t do what he was supposed to do for the money,” Eugene Logan, Emond’s 93-year-old father, said in a telephone interview. “He told us he could get him off. If he’d taken the plea, he’d be out by now.”\n\nTwo courts denied Emond Logan’s attempts to get his sentence overturned based on Terrell’s counsel, but they excoriated Terrell’s lawyering. U.S. District Judge Paul Maloney wrote in a 2017 decision that Terrell had provided “abysmal advice.” A year later, the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decried Terrell’s “woeful representation” and said his overall conduct reflected “poorly on the profession.”\n\nTerrell’s troubled legal practice left him with a worsening tangle of financial problems. Between 2004 and 2015, the IRS filed 11 liens against him for nearly $400,000 in unpaid taxes dating back to 1997. In October 2010, Terrell filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection, reporting $736,938 in liabilities, $304,650 in assets and monthly income of just $4,000. Because he stopped appearing for required meetings, his bankruptcy case was dismissed and none of his obligations were legally erased. During this period, Terrell took out six new mortgage loans against his three-bedroom West LA condominium. The property was sold at foreclosure in 2013.\n\nLorita Seaton was one of Terrell’s many unpaid creditors. She’d loaned him $40,000 in 2008 after he said he needed it to help cover his costs for a pending discrimination suit against Costco. In exchange, Terrell had signed a promissory note committing to pay her $60,000 by year-end. By February 2009, court records show, Terrell had won $422,000 at trial for his client and an additional $510,818 in legal fees and costs. Yet Seaton said she never got a penny.\n\n“He had the audacity to tell me ‘there’s nothing you can do about it,’” she said in an interview. “I want to go stand on the mountain and just holler about this asshole.”\n\nBetween 2006 and 2014, more than a dozen small vendors for Terrell’s law firm went to court seeking to collect more than $170,000 in unpaid bills. A&B Reporting complained that it had prepared more than 30 deposition transcripts for Terrell, billing him more than $40,000 that remained unpaid. According to the company’s 2011 lawsuit, Terrell finally sent a $5,000 check — which bounced.\n\nIn February 2014, as his private financial straits worsened, Terrell formally updated his law office address: from the Beverly Hills tower where he’d worked for more than two decades to a “suite” on Santa Monica Boulevard, which was actually a mailbox at a UPS store. He has filed just a single case in federal court since that year, according to PACER, a public database of court filings and dockets.\n\nTerrell’s financial troubles factored into years of legal warfare among his siblings over their mother’s care and modest estate. In a court filing, Terrell’s younger brother Zachary accused him of borrowing repeatedly from their mother to save his “flailing” law practice and keep his home. Terrell acknowledged accepting a $30,000 gift from his mother after he’d done free legal work for her. The estate case finally ended in late 2021, but Terrell received little because he had already borrowed against his expected inheritance. (Deborah Terrell-Trimble was the only Terrell sibling to respond to our calls and emails for comment, but she declined to answer questions about her brother or the case, saying the family was “trying to heal.”)\n\nTerrell eventually paid off or settled some of his debts, but there’s no record of him paying the IRS or many of his other creditors, whose legal claims typically expire after 10 years in California unless they’re renewed.\n\nAccording to publicly filed liens, he still owed the IRS $92,000 at the beginning of 2024. Yet on the financial disclosure he filed for his Justice Department job, which covered that period, he listed his liabilities as “none.”\n\nNeither Terrell nor the Department of Justice responded to requests for comment about this omission.\n\nAmid the financial pressures at home and at work, Terrell underwent a startling political transformation. In 2019 Fox interviews, he had called Trump “a racial divider” and said he sent out “dog whistles” like “no president on this planet in our country’s history.” Less than a year later, he went all in for Trump. Fox News hired him as a paid contributor soon thereafter, at an annual salary of $250,000.\n\nIn interviews on Fox and other conservative outlets, Terrell offered two reasons for his ideological makeover. The first was the growing influence of the Black Lives Matter movement, which he complained had “hijacked” the Democratic Party, citing far-left calls to “defund the police.” He also objected to Joe Biden’s comment during an interview with a Black radio host that “if you have a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump, then you ain’t Black,” calling it “offensive and insulting to every African American because we don’t vote as one group.”\n\nOver the next four years, Terrell displayed the fervor of the converted. Biden was an “idiot”; Kamala Harris (whose name he repeatedly mispronounced) was only chosen as his running mate “because she’s a woman and because of her race.” Democrats were members of the “anti-Israel” and “pro-Hamas party.” Far-right agitator Laura Loomer was “a journalist,” while NBC’s Kristen Welker was “a DEI hire.” In 2023, Terrell made a pilgrimage to Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort, where he posed poolside, making a thumbs-up gesture. Shortly before starting his Justice Department gig, Terrell made sure he was leaving no culture-war stone unturned. “I hate anti-Semitism! I hate attacks on Catholic Families! I hate attacks on parents expressing their First Amendment Rights at School Board Meetings! I hate Sanctuary Cities! I hate DEI! I hate Critical Race Theory!” he declared on X.\n\n“I love this guy,” Trump gushed, introducing “Leo 2.0” in February at a White House commemoration of Black History Month. “He was a radical Democrat, he became a radical Republican.” Terrell returned the love, telling the audience: “We are in the presence of the greatest president of all time!”\n\nWhat motivated him? Larry Elder, who was on air with Terrell as he announced his conversion and coined the nickname “Leo 2.0,” declined to speculate: “I really don’t care about why Leo did his 180. I’m just glad he finally did!”\n\nJuan Williams, the Fox News senior political analyst, however, called the change in Terrell’s views “performative.” He said Terrell saw an opportunity to cast himself as “coming out of the liberal matrix, and ‘now I’ve seen the light.’ He understood the value in that universe.”\n\nIf it is a performance, it’s one Terrell has continued at the Justice Department, where the effect of his pugnacious style and footloose approach to the law has alarmed career staff accustomed to following strict rules regarding regulatory due process.\n\n“That’s lawyer talk!” Terrell regularly thundered to Justice Department lawyers. “I don’t want to hear any lawyer talk!”\n\nIn the days after his Jan. 23 appointment, several said, Terrell emphatically rejected efforts by agency veterans to explain the legally required steps to bring civil rights complaints against universities.\n\n“Leo did not want to hear our views about how to investigate, how to find a violation, how to proceed in these cases,” said a Justice Department veteran who heard Terrell’s comments. “No ‘lawyer talk’ at the Justice Department! It was just incredibly bizarre.” The attorney was one of 10 current and former lawyers with the agency’s Civil Rights Division interviewed for this story, most of whom asked not to be named for fear of retaliation.\n\nAt another meeting early in his tenure, Terrell told career Justice Department attorneys he thought they were out to thwart his agenda, according to two attendees. “He immediately came in and openly told us that he did not trust any of us or believe anything we said,” one recalled.\n\nThe Justice Department antisemitism task force, which includes officials from the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Education and the General Services Administration, was announced on Feb. 3. It immediately announced antisemitism investigations of four medical schools regarding “offensive” pro-Palestinian “symbols and messaging” displayed by students during their 2024 commencement ceremonies. Then, over the next five weeks, the task force and Trump administration announced plans to investigate 10 universities; the “immediate” cancellation of hundreds of millions in federal funding for Columbia; an investigation of the entire University of California System; and “potential enforcement actions” against 60 colleges in 24 states.\n\nIt’s not clear whether Terrell had a hand in choosing the task force’s targets, but he took the lead in making the government’s case against them publicly.\n\nRelated | Here’s the terrible new way Trump plans to illegally harass universities\n\n“We are suing every one of these universities guilty of antisemitism,” Terrell told Fox News host Mark Levin on March 9. “We’re going to bankrupt these universities. We are going to take away every single federal dollar.” Antisemitism, shouted Terrell, waving his arms, “is rampant across the country!” Hate-crime charges, he vowed, would be brought against “these people who hate Jews.” Terrell blamed campus antisemitism on the MAGA movement’s usual suspects: “the Democrat Party” and “blue cities [that] have turned their back on Jewish Americans.”\n\n“The academic system in this country has been hijacked by the left,” he declared, “has been hijacked by the Marxists!”\n\nFour days later, the task force announced plans to meet with leaders of four cities “rocked” by campus antisemitism (New York, Los Angeles, Boston and Chicago) to determine whether federal intervention was warranted.\n\nCareer civil rights officials, many of whom had served under both Democratic and Republican administrations, were horrified. The Justice Department didn’t publicly announce who it was investigating or planned to sue. It didn’t reach findings before it had found cause in a completed investigation that typically takes months or even years. And investigating Democratic leaders in “blue cities” in the name of fighting campus antisemitism was far outside the department’s charge.\n\n“The process is turned upside down,” said Ejaz Baluch, a senior trial attorney in the Civil Rights Division who left in May and is now a lecturer at Columbia Law School. “We were given a conclusion and told to find supporting evidence to justify it. It’s basically civil rights enforcement as a political tool. These things don’t actually solve antisemitism. It’s about silencing political dissent they disagree with.” Former civil rights deputy chief Jen Swedish, who worked at the Justice Department for 15 years, called the actions “cover for attacking higher ed.”\n\nBack in early February, a division-wide posting seeking attorneys to help staff the antisemitism task force had drawn just three volunteers. Harmeet Dhillon, Trump’s appointee as assistant attorney general for civil rights (and one of his former personal lawyers), later told a Federalist Society conference that this revealed the career staff’s lack of concern about antisemitism.\n\nCurrent and former division attorneys interviewed by ProPublica and The Chronicle said the lawyers had misgivings about the administration’s tactics and were reluctant to work with Terrell, who already had a reputation for berating staffers. One said he’d repeatedly yelled at her.\n\nA memorable episode came in March, when Terrell loudly berated a revered 82-year-old civil rights attorney, Franz Marshall, over the failure to quickly terminate federal oversight in a Louisiana school desegregation case, a goal of Republican state officials.\n\nRelated | Yes, Trump's trying to make America segregated again\n\nMarshall, who had represented the government in hundreds of desegregation cases over five decades, tried to explain that closing the case required a motion by the school district to lift the order, which the Justice Department could support or oppose, and review by a federal judge.\n\n“Who told you that you had to do it this way?” Terrell interrupted. “I want you to name names!”\n\n“This is the process,” Marshall assured him. “I’ve been doing this for a long time.”\n\n“Well, maybe you’ve been doing it for too long!” Terrell snapped. The tirade, which lasted nearly an hour, was audible to dozens of attorneys waiting outside the conference room for an upcoming meeting.\n\nMarshall (who could not be reached for comment) resigned a short time later, joining a wholesale exodus from resignations, firings and reassignments that has totaled about 70% of the Civil Rights Division’s 365 attorneys since January. The Louisiana consent decree was lifted on April 29.\n\nIn late April, Terrell had convened a meeting with some of the remaining lawyers to address concerns about working with him. “That crazy guy you see on TV is not here,” he insisted, according to one attendee. “The guy before you is a civil rights attorney. There’s an urban myth that I scream and yell. I’ve never yelled in my life.”\n\nThere’s little evidence Terrell has been directly involved in negotiations with campuses under investigation; instead, those appear to have been increasingly steered by the White House. Terrell has voiced distrust of any bargaining, preferring to “lay the hammer on them with lawsuits,” as he told Justice Department lawyers in an April meeting. In mid-July, when word leaked that the Trump administration was about to announce an agreement with Columbia to restore its funding, Terrell questioned whether it was tough enough.\n\n“I will not ‘SELLOUT’ Jewish Americans,” he posted on X. “NO DEALS!”\n\nSix days later, the administration announced a $221 million settlement with Columbia, setting the stage for a string of similar deals with other colleges.\n\nRelated | Columbia caves to Trump, setting dangerous precedent for higher ed\n\nThe extremism of Terrell’s messaging also doesn’t bother Dov Hikind, a former New York state Democratic assemblyman representing Brooklyn and the founder of Americans Against Antisemitism. “If Leo Terrell and others are speaking tough, I don’t lose any sleep over that.”\n\nBut the administration’s approach alarms other Jewish groups and erstwhile academic allies in the fight against campus antisemitism. The task force is “using legitimate fears of antisemitism in ways that are both dangerous and wrong,” said Amy Spitalnick, of the Jewish Council for Public Affairs. When Terrell proclaimed on Fox News that the task force would “bankrupt” targeted universities, “they were saying the quiet part out loud,” she added.\n\nWhether Terrell is good for Jews or bad for Jews, his conversion has certainly been good for him. Leo 2.0 now has 2.5 million followers on his personal X account, and his speaking fee runs between $50,000 and $100,000; his government salary is $167,603. Terrell has attained “a rock star persona” in the Trump administration, said Kenneth Marcus, the former Education Department official and antisemitism activist. “People are very much drawn to him in a way that’s disproportionate to his rank in the federal government.”\n\nThere’s no sign administration officials, including Terrell, will let up in their campaign against higher education. Since late July, even as negotiations with Harvard dragged on and Brown’s settlement was announced, the administration froze $108 million in funding from Duke University’s medical system, citing “systemic racial discrimination” in hiring and admissions. It also halted more than $584 million from UCLA as punishment for tolerating a “hostile environment” for Jews and demanded $1 billion to restore the flow of government money. Duke has not publicly responded to the discrimination complaints. The University of California’s president, James B. Milliken, has pledged to work with the administration, but he said a $1 billion penalty would “completely devastate our country’s greatest public university system.”\n\nOther colleges are just trying to stay out of the administration’s dragnet — and Terrell’s sights.\n\n“He’s scared schools stiff, so everyone is scrambling,” said Brett Sokolow, an attorney and higher education consultant whom college and university leaders have turned to for advice.\n\nTerrell’s approach, he said, is “way over the top — and effective as hell.”","summary":"By Peter Elkind, ProPublica, and Katherine Mangan, The Chronicle of Higher Education, for ProPublica\n\n\n\n\nWhen Los Angeles attorney Leo Terrell, a legal commentator, lifelong Democrat and fiery fixture on Fox News, announced on the network’s “Hannity” show that he was voting for Donald Trump in 2020, the MAGA universe went wild.

Or will the exposure of this effort further divide the Democrat activist class?\n\nSixteen Thirty Fund forms a key arm of the Left’s dark money network, bankrolling many of the activist groups that staffed and advised the Biden administration and supporting ballot initiatives across the states. The for-profit company Arabella Advisors manages Sixteen Thirty Fund as a 501(c)(4) nonprofit, alongside other nonprofits like New Venture Fund, Windward Fund, and North Fund. These nonprofits then prop up fiscally-sponsored projects, allowing donors to support the projects without disclosing which projects they fund.\n\nTaylor Lorenz, a left-wing journalist not usually known for turning on her own side, wrote a lengthy Wired exposé about Chorus, which Lorenz identified as a project of the Sixteen Thirty Fund.\n\nA Sixteen Thirty Fund spokesperson confirmed to The Daily Signal that Chorus is a fiscally-sponsored project of Sixteen Thirty Fund.\n\n“Sixteen Thirty Fund (STF) became a fiscal sponsor of Chorus in April 2025,” the spokesperson said. “Fiscal sponsorship is a very common model for nonprofit work. In our case, it allows us to provide a shared operational home to new, progressive nonprofit projects like Chorus. This model enables these projects to focus on their programmatic goals while STF provides administrative services such as compliance and human resources.”\n\nThe Sixteen Thirty Fund’s Chorus\n\nStuart Perelmuter, the former communications director for Rep. John Yarmuth, D-Ky., founded Chorus in November. Perelmuter had previously launched Good Influence, a for-profit influencer marketing agency aimed at helping content creators connect with left-leaning causes. Perelmuter co-founded Chorus with Democratic influencer Brian Tyler Cohen, who has more than 4.6 million YouTube subscribers.\n\nChorus reportedly claims that its initial creator cohort has a collective audience of more than 40 million followers with more than 100 million weekly viewers. \n\nThe nonprofit reportedly offered dozens of Democrat political influencers $8,000 per month to join Chorus’ program—but the money comes with extensive strings attached.\n\nAccording to Wired, Chorus contracts prohibit content creators from using any program funds to make content that supports or opposes any political candidate or campaign without express authorization from Chorus in advance and in writing.\n\nThe contracts reportedly forbid influencers from disclosing their partnership—a standard practice—stipulating that they will “not publicize” the Chorus funding without Chorus’ consent.\n\nThe contracts also reportedly give Chorus the ability to force creators to remove or correct content based solely on the group’s discretion if the content was made at an event organized by Chorus.\n\nAccording to a fundraising deck Wired acquired, Chorus aims to “build new infrastructure to fund independent progressive voices online at scale.” The creators are expected to attend regular advocacy trainings and daily messaging check-ins. \n\nDemocratic content creator Keith Edwards has described the program’s structure as “predatory.”\n\nSixteen Thirty Fund’s Response\n\nSixteen Thirty Fund defended Chorus’ work in a statement to The Daily Signal.\n\n“Chorus is doing crucial work to spread a pro-democracy message to Americans,” the spokesperson said. “Creators working with Chorus have always been encouraged to talk about their involvement in the program.”\n\n“Chorus creators are not paid to support or oppose candidates, but they are free to do so on their own time,” the spokesperson added.\n\nBrian Tyler Cohen’s Response\n\nCohen also responded to Lorenz’s claims in a video posted on X. He described Chorus as “a scholarship program to teach creators how to grow their accounts, foster engagement, launch their own shows, and become profitable on their own.”\n\n“It’s an incubator program to build the pro-democracy ecosystem,” he added.\n\n“Chorus does not pay creators for content, does not tell them what to say, does not control who they talk to or work with, and there is absolutely nothing in the contract that could even be reasonably interpreted to say that they do,” Cohen said. “There are zero restrictions on their content.”\n\nHe acknowledged that the program has “a standard confidentiality clause in the contract to protect the privacy of the creators,” yet he insisted that during the workshop, Chorus clearly told creators that they could talk publicly about the program.\n\nEven if Lorenz’s claims are baseless, Chorus represents an attempt by the donor class to organize social media influencers toward the Left’s goals. \n\nWhat This Means for the Left\n\nAfter the woke activist class dominated the Biden administration and turned off the country, leading to Democrat Kamala Harris’ defeat in November, moderate-leaning Democrats have launched futile efforts to distance themselves from the toxic Marxist brand of gender ideology, climate alarmism, racial division, and technocratic government.\n\nThe consulting group Third Way has published a list of words Democrats should avoid—all terms related to the ideology of the activist Left.\n\nArabella Advisors, the Sixteen Thirty Fund, and the network of foundations set up by Hungarian American billionaire George Soros (and now run by his son, Alex) help to bankroll the woke activist groups pushing this ideology. The Biden administration propelled these nonprofits into positions of influence in the government, and it seemed to endorse every woke cause imaginable.\n\nMany influencers agree with parts of this ideology, but as individuals, they prefer to pick and choose, crafting their own takes that gain them attention and views. Some of them may moderate toward Third Way, but I suspect most of them largely walk in lockstep on these issues.\n\nThey bristle, however, at the idea of one massive dark money network bringing them together and calling the shots. This looks, to them, like institutional capture—and they value their freedom.\n\nI can’t believe I’m saying this, but I am grateful to Taylor Lorenz for exposing this move, and I hope many left-wing influencers notice it for what it is.\n\nFor far too long, the Left has acted as though the only “dark money” activism is on the Right—with the likes of Charles Koch and Leonard Leo. In reality, the Left’s dark money network is larger, partially because the Left represents the party of America’s woke elites.\n\nIf more left-leaning influencers wake up to the dark money on the Left and realize this attempt to coopt their voices, they won’t start supporting Trump. But they might think twice about the institutional structure that upholds the woke ideology—and if that helps them question whether the world is ending because of climate change or whether a man can become a woman just by saying so, I’ll consider that a win.","summary":"One of the most influential left-wing dark money organizations stands accused of trying to buy social media influencers, aiming to unify the Left as Democrats...

Even through nearly 10 years at the helm of Chapman University, he kept a whiteboard in his office crowded with equations.\n\nStaying curious, he said, is what makes him feel most alive.\n\n“I’m always wondering why stuff happens the way it happens. And the only way to answer the question is through research,” Struppa said. “You’re never bored. Never bored. There is never the same problem twice.”\n\nOn a recent morning inside the university’s presidential suite — now occupied by President-elect Matt Parlow — the Italian-born mathematician, whose last day as president is Sept. 1, let his eyes twinkle and his arms wave as he tried to explain why he’s taken up learning Arabic.\n\n“My attraction for math is also due to the shape of the symbols, the way the symbols come together. I cannot explain this very well, but I think that there is some archetypical value of mathematics,” he said. “I’m interested in Arabic mathematics … and that’s why I’m studying Arabic, because a lot of this happens there. And so I’m very curious to see in their work, if one can find some answers.”\n\nStruppa’s curiosity has always doubled as a compass, shaping his tenure in ways big and small, whether guiding Chapman through a once-in-a-century pandemic or pushing the university toward becoming a more research-driven institution.\n\n“Everything he did evolved around that idea,” Jim Doti, Chapman’s president for 25 years before Struppa stepped in in 2016, said. “How can we move Chapman in that direction?”\n\nA mathematician in the president’s chair\n\nStruppa’s academic specialty is Fourier analysis, a field of mathematics that studies breaking complex signals or functions into simpler waves, like sines and cosines, to understand their underlying patterns. By his own admission, it’s “very hard,” but the difficulty is part of the beauty. For him, symbols and equations carry something almost dreamlike, “a glimpse into this universe” that kept him writing and teaching even as he ran a university.\n\nHe never quite left the research world behind.\n\n“I still write two or three papers a year. I just finished a book this week,” he said.\n\nStruppa, 70, concedes that choosing administration three decades ago came with tradeoffs.\n\n“Yes, I do have some regrets. I mean, not huge, because life has treated me well and I kept my mathematics going. But could I have done much more if I’d stayed? Yes, I think so,” he said.\n\nAndrew Jordan, hired in 2021 to co-direct the Institute for Quantum Studies but who has known Struppa for a decade, said the outgoing university leader is “a remarkable guy in that he not only does the president gig, but teaches classes and he does research, too, which I think is amazing.”\n\nUnder Struppa’s tenure, the university shed its image as a regional school, establishing itself as a nationally recognized research institution.\n\nNew buildings rose across campus, and Struppa shepherded the creation of major academic hubs from the Institute for Quantum Studies to the Dale E. and Sarah Ann Fowler School of Engineering, the Schmid College of Science and Technology to the School of Pharmacy in Irvine. Along the way, Chapman also saw steady gains in national rankings, both for the university as a whole and for several of its professional schools.\n\n“All of those are directly Daniele’s vision,” said Justin Dressel, a co-program director of physics at Schmid College. “It’s hard to overstate just how much that’s radically transformed Chapman University’s trajectory.”\n\nStruppa has also recruited world-class faculty, including Vernon L. Smith, a Nobel laureate in economics, and Yakir Aharonov, a National Medal of Science honoree in physics. Aharonov serves as the director of the Institute for Quantum Studies.\n\n“It’s easy to think if you don’t know the ins and outs of the school, well, these professors just came from out of nowhere and suddenly they’re at Chapman. But I can tell you that they all came to Chapman in large part because of Daniele,” said Parker Kennedy, a Chapman trustee. “I’ve talked to some of the professors, not just at the institute, but throughout the campus. And I say, ‘How the heck did you end up at Chapman?’ Because they’re from all over the country and the world. And invariably they say, ‘Oh, I bumped into Daniele at a conference and I got to know him. And here I am.’”\n\nDressel, who came to Chapman in 2015 from the University of Rochester, said Struppa “understands what matters and has managed to emphasize that and also have frank discussions with other academics about what they need.”\n\nIf anything, Struppa found a strange symmetry between his two roles. Running a university required the same instincts as solving a theorem: define the problem, test the possibilities and accept that progress only comes through struggle.\n\nAnd that’s why Struppa said he’s pushed so hard for Chapman to have a strong research program.\n\nOne key reason, he said, is that “when you are a researcher, you learn every day, and that keeps you humble.”\n\nThat experience, he said, helps him be more understanding and patient with students as they wrestle with challenging material.\n\n“When a student doesn’t know how to multiply polynomials, they’re struggling in the same way in which I struggle when I try to understand the quantum physics problem,” he said. “So that to me is maybe the No. 1 most important reason why we need to have researchers in the classroom. They are kept humble and they understand challenge and difficulty and effort.”\n\nThat humility and approachability, Chapman junior Taylor Eskew said, extend far beyond the classroom.\n\nEskew, the Schmid College senator, said she first connected with Struppa at a scholarship dinner at Citrus City Grille in Old Towne Orange.\n\n“It was obvious how rooted he is in the community. Everyone seemed to know him and love him, and that sense of approachability has always stood out to me,” she said.\n\nFor Eskew, the opportunities Struppa fostered have been transformative. Originally drawn to Chapman for swimming and astrophysics, she said the “entire trajectory of my life” changed when she discovered the university’s quantum studies initiatives.\n\n“Quantum is not something that is seen in undergraduate work, like at all. It’s really mainly just a graduate-level study. And so I think it’s really unique that we are given that opportunity to be able to study that,” she said.\n\nDoti said Struppa’s continued teaching gave him unique insight into the university’s academic life.\n\n“One thing Daniele has been able to do that I wasn’t during the time I was president is he’s continued to teach,” he said. “I think that experience is necessary to give a president the insight to know what’s most important. What are the ingredients? What are the factors that lead to an exciting and dynamic experience in the classroom? What raises it to being something special? And you have to teach to see that.”\n\nDecisions from the president’s chair\n\nAnd then there was the time Struppa had to create an engaging and dynamic classroom experience, even when students couldn’t be physically present.\n\n“We closed the university the day before spring break. That’s when the governor told California we need to go into lockdown,” he recalled. “I sent a message to the faculty saying, ‘The university is closing, but the classes continue.’ We had one week to move to an online system. That’s a huge demand.”\n\nStruppa said he still remembers the eerie quiet of campus in the spring of 2020. The classrooms were empty and bottles of hand sanitizer stood guard at every threshold.\n\nChapman weathered the pandemic without layoffs, furloughs or cuts to salaries and benefits, Struppa said.\n\n“I wouldn’t say that it was as if nothing had happened, because that’s not true, but certainly we didn’t miss a beat. So I’m very proud,” he said.\n\n“Often people ask me, and I say this is the time when I was really able to show leadership,” he added. “Most of the time, you just do what you’ve got to do. But that time, it was really more complex.”\n\nBut his leadership has been questioned at times. Support from conservative billionaire Charles Koch’s foundation for what became Chapman’s Smith Institute for Political Economy and Philosophy drew heavy criticism in 2018, with some faculty accusing the university of importing politics into the classroom.\n\nStruppa still defends the decision as one of his proudest.\n\n“It was a beautiful idea,” he said of the Smith Institute’s flagship program, an undergraduate minor in “humanomics” that blends literature, history, philosophy and economics. “I was very proud that I stood up to the pressure because that’s when you see whether a president should be a president or go home and do something else.\n\n“This was an issue of academic freedom,” he said, “you had colleagues who had an intellectual vision and they find a way to support it and just because the support comes from an entity that you may disagree with, there should not be an obstacle.”\n\nKennedy said where Struppa showed special leadership was his consistency in dealing with students and faculty, particularly in the area of free expression.\n\n“He really believes in free speech. So he’s predictable,” Kennedy said.\n\nSome faculty said Chapman was too slow to sever ties with John Eastman, the law professor who was indicted for his role in efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Eastman had already stirred campus outrage with previous stances, including his argument that Vice President Kamala Harris was ineligible for office because her parents weren’t U.S. citizens.\n\nStruppa pushed back hard on the narrative that Chapman was condoning Eastman’s actions. Eastman announced he was leaving the university on Jan. 13, a week after the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\n“It’s interesting that people think we moved slowly,” he said. “It is an indication for me that those who claim we were too slow are just in bad faith.\n\n“I’ll be very clear about this: A university that acts in five days or six is remarkable,” he said of the process required.\n\n“So it wasn’t pleasant, but the university and John separated from each other,” he added, “and I’m happy the way this happened.”\n\nMore recently, pro-Palestine students set up a campus encampment to push for the university to divest from Israel. Again, Struppa says he chose to protect free speech, even as he denied their demands.\n\n“There is no way a democratic society can advance unless we allow people to say stuff that really bothers us. Free speech is designed exactly to protect the speech that you find hideous,” he said. “My refusal to criticize openly John Eastman is paralleled by my refusal to clamp down on the encampments. Because free speech is more important. It’s more important than what I think about John’s statement. It’s more important than what I think about the statement of our students.”\n\nThe encampment ended without arrests or violence, a point Struppa counts as another success.\n\nStruppa has also been pressed on Chapman’s struggles with diversity, especially for Black students and in the last school year for structural changes to its DEI office. In 2021, he publicly said that the university had “a problem we need to address” with how it was supporting Black students and Black students’ lower graduation rate. Three years later, he emphasizes Chapman’s gains with Latino enrollment, and frames Black student numbers as partly a matter of geography and “pipeline.”\n\n“Well, I think that we are growing significantly in our number of Hispanic students, and that is a very natural reflection of where we are. So I think that we’re becoming more representative of the community where we live,” he said. “We don’t have that many Black people living in Orange County. So the numbers that are low, if you look at them in an abstract way, are actually not too surprising.”\n\nHe argues the university has created a welcoming environment, but acknowledges, “it’s a challenge, but part of the challenge is the pipeline … and the location.”\n\nParlow noted Chapman’s founding commitment to access.\n\n“We were founded on the inauguration day of Abraham Lincoln. And the point of our founders was access. Access to education for groups who otherwise couldn’t go to higher ed because of restrictions that were placed on people based on race and gender,” he said. “Those have always been our values of a place of access and so even before we had an office of DEI, this was our mission. It was our mission while we had it, and then now that we no longer have it, it continues to still be part of our mission and what we do.”\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nIf there’s a personal through-line for Struppa, it’s the pull of questions that still bug him.\n\nHe lights up describing a current problem in quantum physics about functions that “oscillate much faster than what we think they should do” and how that relates to analytic functions.\n\nIt’s the kind of puzzle he’s eager to return to.\n\n“The question we’ve been pursuing for the last five or six years is to figure out what is the exact relationship between these two properties. And we’ve written four or five papers, but we don’t have yet the final answer. And I suspect it’s going to take a few more years to do that,” he said.\n\nHe and his wife, Dr. Lisa Sparks, the Foster and Mary McGaw Endowed Professor in Behavioral Sciences, are also turning their attention back to the mountains. Both avid climbers, Struppa proposed to Sparks on Cotopaxi, an active volcano in South America.\n\n“We’re going to do as much as we can of that, as much as our physical body will allow us to do,” Sparks said. “Now we’re going to have a more flexible schedule to do those things that really are part of who we are.”\n\nStruppa hopes to return to Cho Oyu — at 26,864 feet, it’s the world’s sixth-highest peak on the Nepal-Tibet border just west of Everest — once his knee is healed. Sparks said she hopes they can tackle the Camino de Santiago in Spain and spend more time in Italy and Colorado, indulging in hiking, climbing, skiing and the kind of nature that grounds them.\n\nWill he miss the presidency?\n\n“I don’t think so,” Struppa said matter-of-factly.","summary":"Daniele Struppa will be returning to the classroom and research, though he never really left it during his decade leading the university.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/08/31/chapman-universitys-mathematician-president-hands-over-the-reins/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/OCR-L-STRUPPA-0830-11-PB.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-31 14:27:49","author":"Hanna Kang","authors":["Hanna Kang"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.253},{"id":356107838,"title":"The Democrats Display Their Flaws in Minneapolis","text":"More than 400 elected Democrat Party officials from all 50 states and seven territories huddled in Minneapolis this week before the horrible mass shooting at nearby Annunciation Catholic Church. The proceedings demonstrated a party in the wilderness, and the Democrats in the national media mostly steered clear.\n\nFor starters, losing vice-presidential nominee and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz was on his usual bender that Kamala Harris “would have been a fantastic president,” and that if she had won, “we would wake up to an adult with compassion and dignity and leadership doing the work, not a manchild crying about whatever is wrong with him. May his fat ankles find something today. Petty as hell.”\n\nSomeone is feeling petty. It defines the words “sore loser.” This drew raucous applause.\n\n“Think about how easy it would be to be a damn Republican,” Walz added. “Oh, what should I wear today? This stupid frickin’ red hat. What should I say today? I don’t know, just make sure it’s cruel. Who do we listen to? That guy. Oh, the felon in the White House, yeah, listen to him and that’ll be fine.”\n\nThere was plenty of notable quotes at the confab, and Greg Price captured some on Twitter. Insha Rahman of the Vera Institute of Justice said Democrats shouldn’t play on Trump’s issues: “Don’t take the bait, talking about migrant crimes or carjackings or the things that actually don’t matter to many Americans.”\n\nFamilies who lost loved ones in migrant crimes beg to differ.\n\nLindy Sowmick, who is of the Saginaw Ojibwe Nation and is the treasurer of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, made a “land acknowledgment,” lecturing that the land of Minneapolis was stewarded by the “Dakota people” for centuries before colonization: “This land was not claimed or traded. It’s part of a history of broken treaties and promises—and in many ways, we still live in a system built to suppress indigenous peoples’ cultural and spiritual history.”\n\nThe bad news of the meeting was their failure to agree on a policy on Gaza, since the “progressive” faction wanted a dramatically anti-Israel resolution, while Democratic National Committee leader Ken Martin had a more measured statement. But Martin withdrew his policy statement, which looks like a surrender to the far Left.\n\nSome measures were adopted, like the DEI resolution, which called for “Affirming the American Values of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion.”\n\nThe author of the resolution, DNC member Bill Owen of Tennessee, a former state senator, brought religion into it: “To my Republican friends and fellow citizens who profess to be active Christians, I remind them that DEI is the very foundation of the Christian church. I get a little emotional on this, but Jesus loves little children, all the children of the world. Red and yellow, black and white.”\n\nThat’s borrowing from the 1970 Ray Stevens song “Everything Is Beautiful.” The sentiment rings true: Jesus loves all the children. We are equals in God’s eyes. The problem is that “DEI” doesn’t actually match these concepts. It’s more in line with that didactic “white colonizers are still oppressing the Indians” argument, where every white person needs to confess their “privilege” for the original sin of being Caucasian.\n\nThis meeting did not sound like a party that’s figured out why it lost the White House to Trump, or why its cash on hand is about one-fifth of what Republicans have. A few reporters might acknowledge these problems, but overall, the media elites would prefer to keep that chatter low while they stick to obsessing over problems for Mr. “Stupid Frickin’ Red Hat.”","summary":"More than 400 elected Democrat Party officials from all 50 states and seven territories huddled in Minneapolis this week before the horrible mass shooting at...

Allow me to change your mind","text":"“Murderer! You’re a murderer!”\n\nThat is what my French mother shouts down the phone line – right after I tell her I had grouse for dinner.\n\n“Grouse?” she gasps.\n\n“Yes,” I say, using my nonchalant voice. “We went hunting and shot two of them. Plump ones. I braised them in a mushroom broth and served them with stewed apples and potato mash.”\n\nShe shrieks.\n\n“I can’t believe you killed an animal!”\n\n“Mom! Didn’t you just make lamb tagine?”\n\n“Yes, I cooked a Moroccan tagine with raisins, green olives and a lot of cinnamon,” she replies defensively. “I made it with lamb I bought at the farmers’ market. What’s your point?”\n\n“My point is,” I say, “where do you think that lamb came from? Did it magically appear on your plate?”\n\nIt was not a conversation I was going to win, not even with a French woman living in the land of duck foie gras, cured pork sausage and snails – all of which was killed far less humanely than the grouse on my plate.\n\nThat is what I was trying to tell Mom: hunting may be morally complex, but it is a far more honest and sustainable way to consume meat than the factory-farmed products most people eat.\n\nI am not arguing for everyone to go out and hunt their dinner – that would be absurd. But the reflexive disdain for hunters on much of the left feels misplaced.\n\nLet me explain.\n\nIf I truly am a murderer, I am not a very vicious one.\n\nI killed my first mule deer on public land in northern Montana at the tail end of a five-hour hunt in frigid temperatures on Thanksgiving. My partner and I had been tracking signs all day – hiking up and down ridges, glassing hillsides with binoculars – until I could not feel my toes.\n\nWe were ready to give up when the curious eyes of two does landed on us. With their oversized ears and mile-long eyelashes, they looked dainty and otherworldly, as if they had stepped out of a Grimm fairy tale.\n\nThe one in front, maybe 80 yards (73 metres) away, studied me. She had one leg slightly raised, the others rooted in snow, frozen in that split-second decision: flee or stay?\n\nMule deer are naturally more curious and less skittish than their white-tailed cousins, which gave me a crucial edge. I had one extra heartbeat to steady my breath, nestle the rifle into my shoulder, and count to three while exhaling.\n\nI pulled the trigger. The shot echoed across the ridge. The doe’s knees buckled and she collapsed.\n\nMy chest seized – I wanted to give the doe a quick death. I reloaded and fired again, trying to stay steady as adrenaline coursed through my body.\n\nI walked to her, stroked her soft ears and burst into tears.\n\nLooking back, I am not embarrassed by my reaction; it seemed fitting to the gravity of the experience. In that instant – and there is really no other way to describe it – I felt an immense surge of love for that animal.\n\nIt reminds me of what the British philosopher Julian Baggini has wondered about modern food gathering: is disgust at meat eating really a sign of a more civilized society, or simply a mark of one that has become detached from the realities of life and death?\n\nMy ascent to the world of hunting was not linear.\n\nI moved to the United States 10 years ago, carrying with me the wide-eyed fascination so many French people have for America. I had a slightly embarrassing love for its excess, its swagger, the bigness of it all.\n\nBut more than that, it was the land – from the Redwood forests to the Gulf Stream waters, as the song goes – that felt like freedom for me.\n\nDuring my first year in New York City, I befriended Caty and Ryan, two journalists recently transplanted from Santa Fe, New Mexico. Everything about their lives struck me as exotic. Their hallway was cluttered with skis, climbing gear and camping equipment that suggested a life lived outdoors. Mountaineering magazines were strewn on the dining table, and a print of Ansel Adams’s celebrated photograph of the high desert hung on their kitchen wall, austere and magnetic.\n\nSoon, Ryan taught me how to fly fish in the rivers of upstate New York – a hobby so quintessentially American I thought it came with its own Yankee passport. Standing in the Beaverkill river, casting in cold thigh-high waters, I was enthralled. When I caught my first rainbow trout, I held its iridescent body underwater and gasped at its beauty. I removed the hook from its mouth and let it go.\n\nThat winter, Ryan prepared a meal that shifted everything I thought I knew about hunting. Over candlelight, he brought out quails he had shot that fall in his native North Dakota. They had been braised for five hours in apple cider and sage.\n\nSilence fell on the table as we ate. Each bite came with the appreciation of what it took for it to reach our plates: a punishing cross-country road trip followed by freezing mornings traipsing through fields with Magnolia, his trusty hunting Labrador, by his side.\n\nThis food carried a story that was a far cry from the plastic-wrapped slabs of meat stacked in supermarket coolers, and far more interesting.\n\nHunting has always had a terrible reputation in France, especially in affluent cities. In the court of public opinion – especially on the political left, where my heart is firmly anchored – hunters are viewed with suspicion, if not outright contempt.\n\nIt is not without reason. Hunting has long been associated with a retrograde political party formerly called Hunting, Fishing, Nature and Tradition, a right-leaning group that seemed to be populated by portly men who sported mustaches and red cheeks, and had an inclination to drink wine before noon. Now, hunting still only makes headlines when accidents happen.\n\nSo perhaps it is no surprise the sport is in decline: perception matters. In France, about 58% of hunting permit holders are aged 55 or older, and only 3% are women. In the UK, where I lived for eight years, hunting is mostly seen as an upper-class pursuit, and the lingering stain of fox hunting makes it hard to separate the sport in the public eye from cruelty.\n\nBut in the US, hunting is more widely practiced across groups – even across party lines. Kamala Harris’s former running mate, Tim Walz, for example, is a dedicated wild turkey hunter in Minnesota.\n\nIn Missoula, where I live – a blue dot in a red state – my hunting community includes conservationists, outdoor enthusiasts, university lecturers and, more prosaically, people simply looking to fill the freezer. There are plenty of Maga types too, I am sure – they are just not in my social circles. Native tribes across the state, who overwhelmingly skew Democrat, hold hunting rights for both big and small game on their lands; their ancestral foodways are considered sacred. More women than ever before are joining the ranks.\n\nI am one of them. So is my friend DeAnna Bublitz, who wanted to be more intentional with her meat consumption. “I figured that if I couldn’t pull the trigger myself, I should probably stop eating meat,” she says. But entering the hunting world dominated by older men felt intimidating. “I was lucky to have a female friend who is a top-notch hunter and willing to loan me gear and mentor me. That made all the difference,” she says. “There are a lot of barriers for folks who didn’t grow up hunting – cost and mentorship are two of the biggest in my mind.”\n\nThe experience transformed her. Her mentor not only taught her practical skills but also helped her process the complicated emotions that come with killing an animal. Eventually, DeAnna started Deer Camp, a free gear library for hunters, and now mentors new hunters herself – including me.\n\n“The folks I see expressing interest want to eat healthier, more ethical meat and they’re a more diverse crowd – often younger, with a lot of women and people from the LGBTQIA+ community. But those same groups may not feel safe going into the woods alone or with a stranger. How we depict hunting in media, and who we choose to represent it, can go a long way in either making people feel welcome or shutting them out. The experiences you can have out there are incredible, though – fostering new friendships alongside a sense of stewardship for the land.”\n\nIn other words, if you are concerned with the health of our ecosystems, maybe – just maybe – I could change your mind.\n\nPerhaps this is where I should address the elephant in the room: firearms.\n\nIn the US, thanks to the 1937 Pittman-Robertson Act, taxes on firearms and ammunition are funneled directly into wildlife conservation and habitat restoration. Over the decades, it has generated more than $15bn.\n\nHunters are required to take a gun safety course, which means we start out more educated about risks than the broader gun-owning population. While I would love to call myself an archer, which arguably demands more skills, most of us use rifles: they are accurate and they tend to make for a quicker death.\n\nStill, I feel deep ambivalence about firearms. Gun culture unsettles me, and the proliferation of semi-automatic weapons in particular terrifies me. I cannot imagine a world where assault-style rifles belong in civilian hands – let alone with 18-year-olds.\n\nI often think of Australia, a country with plenty of big-game hunters, where a single mass shooting in 1996 prompted sweeping reform led by a conservative government. That policy shift ended mass shootings (and firearm suicides dropped, too). It is the kind of success story I wish we could claim here.\n\nWhat makes it harder to stomach is how far the NRA has drifted. Once an organization rooted in hunting and safety, it has become a cynical lobby that trades in fear and division.\n\nTake Ryan Busse, a longtime gun executive and keen hunter. He quit his role after watching the gun lobby embrace far-right politics to make a buck – then ran for governor of Montana last year (he lost). Writing in the Guardian, he argued that “it’s up to responsible gun owners and others who care about our country to speak out against [the gun lobby’s] egregiously irresponsible behavior and in favor of commonsense laws like universal background checks and extreme risk protection orders”.\n\nStories like his underline what often gets lost: for many hunters, firearms are a means to an end, not an identity.\n\nI often think of this: hunters and vegetarians – both judged by others, both right – are more alike than either would admit.\n\nIt is a complex comparison, but consider this: both think deeply about what they eat. They spend a lot of time pondering food ethics: good quality sustenance, preferably sourced locally. Both care about ecosystems and how to preserve them for future generations. Both worry about animal welfare.\n\nAnd yet in western society, veganism holds the moral high ground. Never mind that many plant-based products come shrink-wrapped in plastic and shipped across oceans. The ingredients in vegan snacks – soy, palm oil, cacao, quinoa, coconut, bananas – are rarely local; they rely on extractive systems, exploitative labor and long-distance freight. Large-scale monocropping for soy, corn and wheat depletes soil and accelerates biodiversity loss.\n\nThis is not a purity test. All I am saying is that eating ethically today is nearly impossible – vegan or not.\n\nBut most wild game meat? It is sustainable, when conservation practices are observed. And I would argue that it is the most ethical meat one can consume.\n\n“Hunters are removing animals, that’s true,” Rebecca Mowry, a wildlife biologist with Montana fish, wildlife and parks, told me. “But they also tend to be extremely passionate about those animals, and deeply invested in making sure they’re still here for future generations.”\n\nEach year, state biologists like her set hunting quotas to address overpopulation. Hunters then pay for licenses – or enter lotteries for tags – and those fees directly support wildlife management programs.\n\nThis system exists for a reason: unchecked animal populations can cause real damage. Deer and hogs, for example, can overgraze and destroy entire ecosystems.\n\nIn France, the National Forestry Office warns that more than 50% of state-owned forests are ecologically out of balance due to exploding populations of deer, roe deer and wild boar. In Texas, feral hogs are so invasive they are costing millions in the agriculture industry – this very newspaper called it “an aporkalypse”.\n\nMowry says hunting “is a very valuable tool to help manage ecosystems, for multiple reasons”. Without enough predators or healthy migration corridors, she explained, big game populations can balloon beyond what the land can support. “We’re not living in untouched wilderness anymore,” she says. “With all the development on winter range, we’ve altered the balance – and hunting helps restore it.”\n\nIn his book How the World Eats, Baggini, the British philosopher, describes the Hadza, Tanzania’s last hunter-gatherer society. “They move with the seasons,” he writes, “taking from the natural environment only what they need to survive, leaving it able to replenish itself – so that any extraction of resources can go on indefinitely.”\n\nThat, Baggini observes, is the very definition of sustainability.\n\nThosh Collins, an Indigenous health educator, author and experienced hunter, echoed this when he told me: “When we harvest, process and cook our food, we’re literally taking the land into our bodies.” His family also seasonally forages on their land in the Arizona desert and grows traditional foods such as corn, bean and squash.\n\nFor Collins, meat carries spirit – not just calories. “From the Indigenous perspective, a hunter possesses the ability to transform death into nourishment,” he says. “One of the most fascinating paradoxes of our lives is that life feeds off of death. Life energy crosses from one form to another. No one person is exempt from this. If you’re living, you’re taking up space from other sentient life forms trying to thrive.”\n\nHis O’odham ancestors never separated sustenance from reverence, and neither does he. After a kill, he performs a giving-of-thanks ritual to help send the animal’s spirit on. Nothing about the act is casual; everything is deliberate.\n\nPart of what makes a hunter successful is the ability to know the habitat they are in: you have to learn to read the land, understand how changing seasons affect species, and how fires, droughts and climate shifts shape entire ecosystems.\n\nWhich is why I do not know any group – aside from Native tribes and biologists – more attuned to the health of elk herds, the decline of pronghorns, or the migration patterns of Canada geese than hunters.\n\nYes, hunters kill animals. But Mowry, the Montana biologist, also points out hunters “are largely responsible for some of the most successful wildlife restorations in the country”.\n\nHow? They fight for public land access – and helped win a political battle earlier this year. They campaign for clean water, wildlife corridors and the removal of barbed-wire fences that kill mule deer and antelope. They report poachers. They fill out wildlife surveys that provide essential data to state officials. Some groups lobby against encroaching development; others build education programs. Many donate meat to food banks. They mentor newcomers, volunteer their time and skills, and open their tables to others.\n\nIn other words, hunters do not just understand interconnectedness – they live it.\n\nCan we all say the same?\n\nAfter seven years in New York, I moved out west to Montana with my partner Ben, an enthusiastic outdoorsman. The move to the Rockies was a culture shock: I left skyscrapers for snow-capped mountains, $23 cocktails in Manhattan for sticky floors in boisterous dive bars.\n\nIt was also the perfect terrain to learn how to hunt my own meat.\n\nThe learning curve was steep. For months, Ben patiently fielded my endless questions: how do you follow a game trail? When do bucks rut – and why do their lymph nodes swell? What’s an elk herd’s migration pattern? Should I worry about chronic wasting disease?\n\nI had to learn how to move in the woods: slowly, methodically, discerning broken branches, bedding areas or fresh droppings. I practiced reading wind direction using a neat little indicator powder, studied how to scan hillsides using binoculars, and mastered the art of opening snacks without making any noise.\n\nStill, I was afraid I would not be able to carry the responsibility of taking an animal’s life. I had to remind myself that by my standards eating a burger at McDonald’s or chicken strips at my local bar was a worse choice.\n\nI studied and passed the hunter safety course. I joined Venery, a women’s hunting group, and spent time with them at the shooting range, familiarizing myself with a tool that until then had been foreign and terrifying to me: a .308 Winchester rifle. Learning with other women gave me the confidence I needed to later go in the field, where I had both amazing and dispiriting experiences. Hunting, after all, is never a promise — it’s unpredictable, and often hard.\n\nTo kill is to bear witness to the cycle of life. No longer can you outsource the unpleasantness – not to Whole Foods, not to Lidl, not even to your local farmer. Digging your fingers through the entrails, you take ultimate responsibility for your own sustenance.\n\nI hesitate to say this, but it is an elating feeling: with it comes a sense of self-reliance long forgotten, especially when everything you would ever want can be delivered to you overnight by underpaid delivery workers.\n\nHunting is the opposite of that: it is patient, demanding, gnarly. It comes with smells, textures and colors rarely seen by anyone eating commercial meat.\n\nIt is also new language: as you spend days climbing hills and crossing marshes for a chance to complete the task, you live in the present.\n\nCollins, the O’odham hunter, told me that his sister is a former vegan. Now, she “will only eat the meat my dad and I hunt because she knows we did it with a good heart and mind and that a ceremony was performed for the buck to send his spirit to rejoin his relatives”.\n\nFor Collins, hunting is part of a broader circle of sustenance passed down from his ancestors. It’s not just about the meat, but about gratitude, ceremony and a sense of duty.\n\n“Foodways is about doing things on the land with people you love, for people you love,” he said.\n\nThese days, I eat far less store-bought meat – though I will admit a weakness for poultry, a whole ethical mess of its own. Instead, we often have elk backstraps, ground venison and summer sausage – all processed at home, wrapped in butcher paper adorned with handwritten details and the processing date on it, stacked deep in my freezer chest.\n\nLast fall, I killed a young whitetail buck. Ben and I butchered it in two hours, under the sun filtering through the ponderosa pines. We took with us tenderloins, backstraps, shanks, legs, with leftovers going to scavengers – nothing going to waste.\n\nBack home, I marinated the deer’s heart – a perfectly tender piece of meat – in a mixture of soy, Worcestershire sauce, olive oil, thyme and vinegar. I grilled it alongside a pile of red peppers, zucchinis and onions, and served it with buttered sourdough bread. My golden retriever, Billie, happy to act as my sous chef, ate the scraps.\n\nForest to plate, in under 48 hours.","summary":"When I killed my first mule deer, I felt deep reverence for the animal.

Pinkerton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.164},{"id":356101532,"title":"Troops in the streets: The police-state dark side of democracy","text":"Donald Trump’s deployment of the National Guard, along with other military or paramilitary forces, to “police” the streets of Washington, D.C., Los Angeles and very likely other American cities can be called many things. It’s ominous, and clearly meant to be. It’s dangerous to the future of democracy — assuming, for the moment, that’s still what we have in this country. It’s also clumsy, farcical and potentially self-destructive; I would argue that those qualities complement the menace, rather than undercutting or contradicting it.\n\nBut here’s what it’s not: It’s not unprecedented, or even all that unusual. According to the pseudo-moral discourse of “norms” and “guardrails” in which so much of American journalism remains imprisoned, we don’t do troops in the streets in the world’s leading democracy, because then we wouldn’t be the world’s leading democracy, would we? Except, of course, in rare and exceptional circumstances governed by strict rules — which sounds convincing unless you bother to look closely, which is when you discover that the exceptional circumstances have happened pretty often for all kinds of reasons, and the rules are so hazy and indistinct as not to be rules at all.\n\nIt’s more accurate to say that there’s a weak political taboo around sending troops into the streets — a taboo almost more honored in the breach than the observance — and that presidents or governors need to embrace or concoct a purportedly compelling reason for violating that taboo. Sometimes that reason strikes most people as plausible, as in the wake of a hurricane, an earthquake or a major wildfire. But not always. Trump is far from the first president to use the National Guard to demonstrate federal supremacy over state and local governments, which is something of a sore point in U.S. history, as you may recall.\n\nNone of which is to say that there aren’t distinctive and troubling qualities to Trump’s ramped-up use of military force in American cities. It’s just that those troubling qualities are inherently subjective. As is so often the case, Trump, molded by the sharper minds in his inner circle, has perceived the flaws and weak spots in our crumbling 18th-century constitutional order and exploited them ruthlessly. What troubles so many non-MAGA citizens (an actual majority, if we believe recent polls) is not the fact that the president is sending in the troops, but exactly who that president is and why he’s doing it.\n\nThis is neither an original observation nor an encouraging one, but the second Trump presidency represents the fulfillment, or near-fulfillment, of a tendency toward ever-increasing executive power that extends back at least as far as Franklin D. Roosevelt, and arguably all the way to Abraham Lincoln and the Civil War. This may be too much historical shorthand, but one could argue that the extraordinary extensions of presidential powers that Lincoln used to crush the Confederacy marked the beginning of a process that brought us all the way here, to the brink of a neo-Confederate authoritarian idiocracy. If that’s even 10 percent true, it has to rank as one of the cruelest historical ironies imaginable.\n\nWhat’s distinctive about Trump’s domestic use of the military, of course, is that the excuse for it is transparently absurd: The alleged disorder the Guard has been dispatched to suppress is either invented or imaginary. In L.A., the crisis was entirely the result of the federal government’s overtly racist and willfully indiscriminate police-state actions, in seeking to detain and deport undocumented immigrants by the thousands (along with whoever else got swept up). There is no crime wave in D.C., as has been extensively documented, but the existence of any crime whatsoever — especially if committed by a Black person — was all that was necessary.\n\nBut if we understand Trump’s troop deployments as political theater aimed at his base — and intended both to crush protest movements and divide the political opposition — well, there’s nothing new about that at all. As it happens, I got my first lesson about this as a small child, when then-Gov. Ronald Reagan sent the California National Guard into the streets of Berkeley in May 1969.\n\nOK, that’s not quite true: My memories of those weeks are fragmentary and unreliable, and I lived two miles away from the conflict zone, on a bucolic suburban street of Arts & Crafts houses and enormous plane trees. (A few blocks up the hill from Kamala Harris!) Most of what I actually know about the People’s Park protests I learned after the fact. I told people for years that Berkeley had been under martial law, which wasn’t technically true. To be fair, it kind of felt like it at the time.\n\nEven at 56 years distance, these events — which originated in a seemingly minor land-use dispute between community activists and the University of California — seem strangely contemporary. Reagan had been elected on a pre-MAGA wave of right-wing outrage, promising to crush the pre-woke student protests of the late ‘60s, and seized on the People’s Park protests as a golden opportunity for street theater and good TV. He sent in 2,700 National Guard troops, a force many times larger than was conceivably necessary, and they spent the next two weeks breaking up even small and peaceful demonstrations with tear gas, batons, rubber bullets and (occasionally or allegedly) buckshot.\n\nI must interject here that Maj. Gen. Glenn Ames, commander of the California National Guard, claimed, in a monologue worthy of “Dr. Strangelove” or perhaps “The Odyssey,” that Berkeley degenerates had tried to poison or contaminate his all-American troops: “LSD had been injected into fudge, oranges and apple juice which they received from young hippie-type females.” I think we all needed that.\n\nGrowing up in Berkeley involved believing that we were special people in a special place, a notion also enforced (if mostly in a negative sense) by the rest of the world. So the National Guard thing seemed special too. It definitely wasn’t, except for the minor but intriguing point that in Berkeley almost everyone involved was white. Consider these examples, which are by no means encyclopedic.\n\nDraft Riots, New York City, 1863\n\nYou can definitely go further back into American history than this, given that the official history of the National Guard is much longer than that of the U.S. military, and begins with the militia established by British authorities in the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1636. But there’s no doubt that the “draft riots” of July 1863, an unstable and ugly combination of class conflict and race war, marked a decisive turning point in the use of federal power to quell urban disorder — and offered a pre-echo of many subsequent events, up to and including Jan. 6.\n\nAt the obvious risk of oversimplifying this complicated and dreadful event, what began as a legitimate protest against a harsh conscription law that targeted working-class men — many of them impoverished immigrants from Ireland with no stake in the Civil War — rapidly degraded into an outright pogrom against Black New Yorkers and their homes and businesses, along with government buildings and institutions. Perhaps as many as 1,200 people were killed (no one knows for sure) and thousands more Black residents were burned out of their homes and forced to leave the city.\n\nThe mayor and the governor dithered for several days before requesting federal intervention (I don’t know; does anything about that sound familiar?), but finally a force of 4,000 regular Army troops, less than two weeks after fighting at Gettysburg, arrived to stop the violence. Historical scholarship on the draft riots is intensive and disputatious; my only concluding point is that they seem to contain all the most painful and contradictory lessons of our nation’s history in compressed form.\n\nPublic school integration, Little Rock, Arkansas, 1957\n\nArguably we should pause to consider the use of federal troops in the South during Reconstruction, which was thematically connected both to the draft riots and to this event. For economy’s sake, let’s skip forward nearly a century to the early years of the civil rights movement and another signal use of federal power. President Dwight Eisenhower — a Republican, in case you hadn’t noticed — sent the National Guard to Arkansas’ capital city to enforce the terms of the Supreme Court’s ruling in Brown v. Board of Education that made racial segregation in public schools illegal.\n\nShall we talk about painful historical irony a bit more? This showdown mesmerized the nation and struck many people, in America and around the world, as the beginning of a reckoning with the legacy of slavery that might lead, on some distant day, to a society of genuine racial equality. Well, OK, and it also began the process that turned the white South hardcore Republican — and now we have reached the dystopian-narrative plot point where the possible reversal of the Brown decision no longer seems inconceivable. Nope, I never thought I would find myself writing those words either.\n\nCivic uprising aka “race riots,” Detroit and Newark, 1967\n\nIt’s unfair to link the events in these two cities too much. They had disparate and quite different causes, and in the hazy historical imagination they blend together into the “long hot summer” and also into the epoch-shaping following year, when insurrections or riots broke out in numerous cities after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nBut even amid the near-constant social chaos of the late ‘60s, Detroit and Newark stand out for a number of important reasons. In both instances, the inciting incident involved alleged or apparent racist violence perpetrated by white cops in increasingly Black cities. (Neither city became majority Black, however, until after the uprising and/or rioting, when white flight intensified.) The level of outrage and the amount of property destruction was admittedly remarkable, and reflected years of built-up anger.\n\nIf anything, the level of state violence in response was even more disproportionate. In Detroit, after Republican Gov. George Romney and President Lyndon Johnson had gotten over their personal and political animosity, they sent in 8,000 National Guard troops and nearly 5,000 regular Army soldiers, all of which arguably made the violence worse. (The Guard shot and killed at least nine unarmed people under, at best, dubious circumstances.)\n\nRather than offer a potted history of the similar-but-different 1967 violence in Newark, I refer you to Salon contributor Bob Hennelly, who can tell this story better better than almost anyone. Oh, but wait: The truly important part here, I suspect, is that white people, in Michigan and New Jersey and pretty much everywhere else, were terrified out of their wits. The reputations of those two cities were permanently poisoned, and the contagious notion that American cities in general were full of angry Black people eager to commit mayhem spread throughout the Caucasian body politic. As difficult as this may be to imagine, Donald Trump was a 20-year-old college student at the time.\n\nKent State, Ohio, 1970\n\nThis perhaps overly-famous event, like the weeks of protest in Berkeley I don’t exactly remember, didn’t have anything to do with race, at least not explicitly. Leading student radical Tom Hayden made a somewhat cogent case, both then and later, that the antiwar movement on American campuses became adjacent to or allied with racial justice movements in the cities, which fueled establishment paranoia and led to exaggerated military response. That sure-enough happened at a normally placid state school in Ohio in May 1970, when a posse of poorly trained and obviously freaked National Guard troops opened fire on a nonviolent demonstration, killing four students and wounding nine others.\n\nLook, I’m not saying Kent State was inconsequential: All lives, in fact, do matter! But in a list full of embedded historical ironies, it’s noteworthy that the deaths of four college kids, as memorialized in a doleful pop-rock ballad, had a generational impact out of scale with a bunch of more dramatic or more violent events. For our current purposes, it’s worth adding that a not-inconsequential percentage of the public looked at what happened in that Kent State field and were like, lol yes!\n\nRodney King “riots,” Los Angeles, 1992\n\nHere we reach another history-changing event that quite a few of today’s readers can actually remember, which arrived as a massive shock to the American system at the tail end of the supposedly peaceful and prosperous Reagan-Bush I years. After LAPD officers were acquitted on all criminal charges for the vicious beating of Rodney King, an unarmed Black man, much of the metropolitan area erupted in what remains the largest single civil disturbance in American history.\n\nIt was another tale of two narratives, set against a social landscape in which violent crime was much more pervasive than it is today. (I know, almost nobody believes this, and you might not either: It’s true!) For many Black people, this was evidence that 25 years after the “long hot summer” very little had changed in terms of police racism and economic segregation. For a lot of white folks, it was more OMG the cities are chaotic, violent and disastrous and we need to lock ‘em all up.\n\nThere’s no way to sugarcoat the scale of destruction, which extended over more than 30 square miles. Almost no one would claim that sending in the National Guard was unnecessary in this case; it ultimately took 10,000 Guard troops and about 600 U.S. Marines to restore an uneasy peace. Los Angeles and its troubled police department were permanently changed by this trauma, and I would argue that on a national scale we are still living in its aftermath, which included Bill Clinton and neoliberalism and mass incarceration and … wow, somebody stop me before this gets really depressing.\n\nWant more sharp takes on politics? Sign up for our free newsletter, Standing Room Only by Amanda Marcotte, also a weekly show on YouTube or wherever you get your podcasts.\n\nOne reason why so many people refuse to believe today’s crime statistics, I suspect, is the enduring suspicion that what happened in ‘92 is waiting to happen again. We could call that bad conscience, but why be judgmental? Oh yeah, and in 1992 Donald Trump was a playboy tycoon in his mid-40s, at the peak of his tabloid celebrity. The King riots, and the Central Park Five case, would shape his understanding of social reality from that moment onward.\n\nBlack Lives Matter protests, numerous cities, 2020\n\nSpeaking of bad conscience, all of that happened five years ago this summer, after the killing of George Floyd. Seems like yesterday and also like a bygone era, right? The National Guard was called out in lots of places and did very little to reduce the tension, but despite the blatant longings of the guy in the White House, also didn’t make things worse. I think this history is too recent to unpack in any coherent way, but I think the Black Lives Matter summer both led to the election of Joe Biden later that year and to, y’know, what happened after that. Does that make sense?\n\nU.S. Capitol, Jan. 6, 2021\n\nSpeaking of not making sense: I don’t really want to dwell on this one, do you? The National Guard got there eventually. Almost everyone who was arrested or convicted got away with it, and a lot of them never got caught in the first place. Do you want me to try to convince you that this event, and its still-unresolved meaning for you and me and our so-called republic, have nothing to do with race? Tell that to Laura Loomer.","summary":"Trump isn't the first president to send troops into American cities as political theater: But there's a difference","url":"https://www.salon.com/2025/08/31/troops-in-the-streets-the-police-state-dark-side-of-democracy/","image":"https://www.salon.com/app/uploads/2025/08/National-Guard-in-DC-2231532795-150x150.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-31 10:30:09","author":"Andrew O'hehir","authors":["Andrew O'hehir"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.14},{"id":356207840,"title":"MAGA Hypocrisy Exposed! Trump Death Rumor Defenders Once Spread Biden “Proof of Life” Conspiracies","text":"MAGA supporters have been having a busy past few days while trying to slam all the Donald Trump death conspiracy theories online. However, they are getting called out for doing the same and spreading health conspiracies about ex-president Joe Biden.\n\nBrigitte Gabriela was called hypocritical for her post on Trump’s death and health rumors. On the other hand, back in July 2024, she posted, “Is Joe Biden alive?” This was during the former president’s health struggles.\n\nGabriel is an author and a National security expert, so people expect better from her. During that time, Biden was also getting flak for his bad performance against Trump, and that made him step down from the race.\n\nSit down. pic.twitter.com/NE3u95vitr\n— Human☮🇺🇸🇺🇦🇺🇸🌊 (@4HumanUnity) August 30, 2025\n\nKamala Harris stepped up as the candidate for the Democrats, and Gabriel made the tweet targeting the former president’s health. Now her tweet for Trump is not receiving the support that she expected.\n\nThe netizens called her out on her hypocrisy. One of the users wrote that MAGA is some of the worst and stupid people. Another one added that they only have double standards; otherwise, they won’t even have any standards.\n\nTo the hundreds of thousands of woke left who posted that they hoped the Trump dead rumor was true. Here he is playing golf. I’m not part of the 2 party system, but I never saw the right doing this about Joe Biden when he was president.\n\n— Erin Elizabeth HNN (@ErinHNN) August 30, 2025\n\nPeople also pointed out MAGA for lying and spreading fake messages. A similar thing happened with another MAGA supporter, Erin Elizabeth, who posted about Trump playing golf and slamming his death rumors.\n\nHere’s the exact same video, TWO MONTHS AGO. pic.twitter.com/bEtmCLsOQx\n— Golf Ersclubhouse (@Golfersclubhe) August 30, 2025\n\nErin also added that this did not happen when Biden was the president. Only one user commented to support her, saying, “Exactly! They covered Joe’s dementia up. Smh.” On the other hand, people started adding screenshots of her Biden conspiracy theory tweets in the comments.\n\nThat is a brutal way to slam someone with proof. Moreover, one user pointed out that the video she shared is old and was shared two months ago. Commentators also called MAGA evil and unimaginable with their lies and theories.\n\nEarlier in 2024, Lauren Boebert was asking for Biden to step in front of the camera to give proof of life. So Biden did get the scrutiny amidst his health and death conspiracies.\n\nTrump’s health has been a hot topic as he’s seen declining mentally and physically. Even the experts weigh in to assess his visible symptoms given his age. So such rumors aren’t entirely baseless.","summary":"MAGA Republicans have been slamming Donald Trump death conspiracy theories online.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/maga-hypocrisy-exposed1trump-death-rumor-defenders-once-spread-biden-proof-of-life-conspiracies","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/MAGA-supporters-slam-Trumps-death-rumors-but-get-backlash.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-31 10:24:53","author":"Diksha,Fwaehler/x; Maga_trigger/x","authors":["Diksha","Fwaehler/x; Maga_trigger/x"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.721},{"id":356095276,"title":"Sir Rod Stewart, 80, enjoys an evening at Soho House in Malibu with wife Penny Lancaster, 54, as they're joined by sons Alastair, 19, and Aiden, 14","text":"SHARE SELECTION\n\nReal Estate\n\nTaylor Swift\n\nJennifer Lopez\n\nBlake Lively\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nU.K. Showbiz\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSunday, Aug 31st 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInternet sleuths reveal millionaire CEO is 'jerk' tennis fan who snatched US Open star's hat away from child\n\nAiling department store stuns Wall Street with back-to-basics U-turn and stock skyrockets 20%\n\nDisturbing unsolved mystery of backpacker pals who vanished hours into volcano hike... before rescuers found sinister pictures on their phones and remains scattered around jungle\n\nThe awful truth about Bruce Willis' dementia.

Who are you to tell someone what someone should or shouldn't have?'\nHe balked at 'the audacity' and slammed his fans' unsolicited opinions: 'That's not your place. God decides what we deserve.'\nIn response to his post, fans flooded his comments section with messages voicing concern, calling out his 'hypocrisy' and urging him to 'take a social media break.'\nElsewhere, Justin was also accused by fans of 'acting single' and appeared distant, with little social media posts featuring Hailey, with the couple previously looking tense in pap shots from earlier this year. \n'Baby, I ain't walking away / You were my diamond / Gave you a ring / I made you a promise / I told you, I'd change / It's just human nature / These growing pains / And baby, I ain't walking away,' he sings in the chorus of the track Daisies.\nHowever, it appears the couple are now back on track following their rocky patch, with sources revealing how they used a recent family holiday to reconnect. \nEarlier this month it was clear the couple had been making considerable efforts into their relationship by making time for each other. \nJustin had shared a collection of pictures of him and Hailey as they enjoyed a loved-up date night outdoors. The couple - who married in 2018 - cozied up to each other on quilts and pillows set on a crop of lush green grass.\nThe images were soundtracked by Otis Redding's 1965 tune That's How Strong My Love Is. \nJustin BieberHailey BaldwinIdaho\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nHailey Bieber stuns in a sexy black top as she leaves West Hollywood date night with husband Justin after the couple overcame their marital woes\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments (0)\n\nComments are subject to our House rules and Terms\n\nLog in to comment\n\nWorst rated\n\nNo one seems to have shared their thoughts on this topic yet\nLeave a comment so your voice will be heard first.\nTerms | Privacy | Feedback\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVictoria Beckham basks in the sun in a swimsuit while hubby David dives into a thrilling new read as they relax on their yacht in Capri\n\nIconic 1980s band member dies as friends pay heartbreaking tribute to the drummer\n\nThe awful truth about Bruce Willis' dementia.

Harris.\"\n\nA senior advisor to Harris also confirmed the news to NBC, saying: \"The vice president is grateful to the United States Secret Service for their professionalism, dedication, and unwavering commitment to safety.\"\n\nHarris is currently due to go on a tour across the US for her 107 Days memoir, which will be released in September, exploring her presidential campaign last year.\n\nBecause of the threat to her safety, an update has been announced which will allow her to continue that protection.\n\nAs of now, the former VP will receive protection from the California Highway Patrol.\n\nThe LA Times reported that authorities came forward to confirm the deal, claiming it came about after a conversation between California Governor Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass.\n\nNot only does Harris lose physical security but also threat intelligence to detect plans for attacks.\n\nMayor Karen Bass has since slammed Trump's decision, as per the Daily Mail: “This is another act of revenge following a long list of political retaliation in the form of firings, the revoking of security clearances and more.\n\n“This puts the former Vice President in danger and I look forward to working with the governor to make sure Vice President Harris is safe in Los Angeles.”\n\nAs for her future plans, Harris previously spoke with Stephen Colbert on The Late Show and shared that she plans to take a break from politics.\n\n\"At this time, I will continue serving and leading outside of elected office,\" Harris had announced earlier this year.\n\n\"I’m eager to reconnect with the American people, support Democratic candidates nationwide who are committed to bold leadership, and share more about my next steps in the months to come,\" she added.\n\nColbert then pointed out that Harris beat every other candidate in early polling and also asked why she decided not to run for governor of California.\n\nHe said: \"Why are you sitting this out? Are you saving yourself for a different office?”\n\nWhile she said no, the crowd was enthusiastically chanting ‘yes’.","summary":"![CDATA[Harris is going on her US tour to talk about her memoir, '107 Days']]","url":"https://www.unilad.com/news/politics/kamala-harris-secret-service-trump-revoked-californial-offer-509156-20250831","image":"https://images.ladbible.com/resize?type=webp&quality=70&width=1200&fit=contain&gravity=auto&url=https://images.ladbiblegroup.com/v3/assets/blt949ea8e16e463049/blt77f612d6c1e338cd/68b41579248cccd8e68b0f6d/trump-kamala.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-31 09:27:37","author":"Britt Jones","authors":["Britt Jones"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.028}]}
