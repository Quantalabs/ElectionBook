Harris joined liberal journalist Kara Swisher at the Warner Theatre in Washington, D.C., to discuss her new book, \"107 Days,\" which details her whirlwind experience in the 2024 election. During the interview, Harris touted her own credentials, comparing them to those of the Trump administration and said, \"Some people have actually said I was the most qualified candidate ever to run for president.\" \"I like the ‘some people say,’ very nice, but go ahead,\" Swisher joked in response. The phrases \"some people say\" and \"many people are saying\" are often considered to be some of Trump’s common phrases typically used before he touts the accomplishments of himself and his administration.

Like, who said that?\" Rogan said. \"You are literally running against a guy who was already president. So, if you're going based on your resume, you're not more qualified than Biden. Biden was the vice president of the United States for eight years!\" Schulz responded on how the GOP is using Harris' book tout to show why she lost the election. \"When she went away for a while, I think you could be like, you could pretend about what she was and what she stood for,\" Schulz said before highlighting how on her book tour she ignited controversy about why she couldn't pick Pete Buttigieg as her running mate. BILL MAHER RIPS KAMALA HARRIS' BOOK, SAYS IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED, 'EVERYONE SUCKS BUT ME' Rogan pointed to a 2021 Harris' Columbus Day message that recently resurfaced. Harris said at the time that the U.S. \"must not shy away\" from its \"shameful past\" of European explorers who she said ushered \"in a wave of devastation for tribal nations.\" \"Did you see her Columbus Day message to America?\" he asked. \"Oh God. It was like, 'Don't forget the horrors that the Europeans did to the — OK. Jesus Christ.

(RELATED: KJP Reveals How She Learned Biden Was Dropping Out Of The Race)\n\n“I don’t know. I don’t know,” Axelrod said. “I mean, you know, people have said different things and, you know, the public witnessed what it witnessed.”\n\n“But even if, even if, he, even if he [Biden] was functioning in an impeccable way, then if you want to accept that, the idea that we knew how he was going to be when he was 83 and 84 and 85 and 86, I think is farfetched,” Axelrod added. “And that was what was irresponsible.”\n\nFollowing Biden’s disastrous debate against President Donald Trump in June 2024, White House logs reviewed by the New York Post reportedly showed a top Washington, D.C. neurologist had met with former White House physician Kevin O’Connor earlier that year. During the debate, Biden could be seen struggling to finish his arguments and freezing mid-sentence at one point.\n\nCalls for the former president to withdraw from the race quickly came from Democrats and media pundits who had once urged him to run. By July 21, 2024, Biden announced he would step down from the race and instead endorse former Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee.\n\nFor years, Democrats downplayed Biden’s mental decline, with lawmakers calling him “sharp” and aides dismissing videos of him stumbling or misspeaking as “cheap fakes.” Republicans had long warned about signs of Biden’s fading mental acuity prior to his 2020 campaign, but many Democrats continued to defend him until the debate.\n\nNow, with Republicans investigating Biden’s mental fitness during his time in office, both O’Connor and former Jill Biden chief of staff Anthony Bernal have pleaded the Fifth before lawmakers, refusing to answer questions about their time in the White House and the former president’s cognitive health.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Neither replied to phone and email inquiries. \n\nThe state GOP weighed in on the matter in the county over the weekend. \n\n“The decision by Democratic members of the Passaic County Board of Elections to block the use of security cameras in ballot storage areas and their refusal to require a sign-in/out log for anyone accessing mail-in ballots is alarming,” New Jersey Republican Party Chairman Glenn Paulsen said in a statement on Saturday. “The fact that the [Bureau of Election]’s Chairman also happens to be the County Democratic Chairman makes it even worse.”\n\nPassaic County, as noted in my book, “The Myth of Voter Suppression,” has faced voter fraud prosecutions in recent years, primarily with state charges against members of the Paterson, New Jersey City Council. \n\n“In recent years, Passaic County has been home to infamous voter fraud schemes and among the slowest counties to count ballots and certify elections in the entire state,” Paulsen added on Saturday. “Frankly, given that, the Passaic County Republican Party is justified in their suspicion about what happens outside of public view, and the NJGOP stands firmly behind their legal demands for election integrity and transparency.”\n\nRepublican Jack Ciattarelli and Democrat Mikie Sherrill are facing off in the New Jersey governor’s race. \n\nIn May 2020, state investigators uncovered alleged mail-in ballot irregularities and charged two city council members and several associates with election fraud, unauthorized ballot possession, forgery, and tampering with public records. State prosecutors alleged unsealed ballots were collected and altered and 3,190 out of 16,747 ballots cast were disqualified, prompting a judge to order a new election in November 2020. \n\nThe Justice Department did not immediately respond to an inquiry for this story.

For the live-streaming event in September, my production company Harpo was asked to bring in set design, lights, cameras, microphones, crew, producers, and every other item necessary (including the benches and chairs we sat on) to put on a live production. \n\n\"I did not take any personal fee.

He’s doing this by cracking down on the crime and criminal organizations that send waves of people and illicit drugs into our country.\n\nTrump announced Sunday that he would be cutting off all aid to the nation of Colombia and blasted President Gustavo Petro for being an “illegal drug leader.”\n\nThe State Department revoked Petro’s visa in September when he joined a protest in New York City and allegedly called for U.S. troops to disobey orders.\n\nTrump continued to rhetorically hammer the Colombian government just as the U.S. military continues to hammer drug traffickers off their coastline.\n\n“They make drugs, they refine drugs, they make cocaine, they have cocaine factories,” Trump said on Sunday. “They have no fight against drugs, and I’m stopping all payments to Colombia because they don’t have anything to do with their fight against drugs.” \n\nIt isn’t just Colombia that Trump has tussled with. He’s used military strikes to annihilate drug traffickers off the Venezuelan coastline while putting pressure on the regime of leftist Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro. Maduro’s government almost certainly helped the vicious Tren de Aragua gang infiltrate the United States.\n\nThe president’s moves in Central and South America and the Caribbean mark a central and somewhat overlooked cornerstone of his national security policy. As I and others have noted, Trump appears to be reviving a sort of new Monroe Doctrine, where the U.S. is more focused on dealing with issues in the Western Hemisphere. Trump’s early moves regarding Greenland, the Panama Canal, and trade with Mexico and Canada suggested as much.\n\nThe fact that Trump has devoted much time and attention on securing peace deals in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and elsewhere doesn’t preclude this. In fact, I’d say it’s a part of this administration’s shifting focus. Peace far abroad, containment of China in Asia, and stability at our national doorstep. These all seem to be very much a part of the “Trump doctrine.”\n\nWhat’s interesting to me is that Trump is actually addressing the “root causes” that created the border and immigration crisis that the Biden administration allowed to burn out of control.\n\nRemember that back in 2021 then-Vice President Kamala Harris announced she was tasked with solving those so-called root causes.\n\nHarris said on Twitter, now X that President Joe Biden “asked me to lead our diplomatic work with Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. To address the situation at the southern border, we have to address the root causes of migration. It won’t be easy work—but it’s necessary.”\n\nThe strategy ended up being like the Democrat strategy at home. There were lots of promises about addressing “inequality” and some nice words about democracy and human rights, but little seemed to get done. In fact, the problem worsened.\n\nWhen some countries actually did try to solve the problems plaguing the region—mainly crime and broken economies—the Biden administration acted with hostility. El Salvadorean President Nayib Bukele made it his mission to annihilate the criminal gangs destroying his country by throwing them en masse in prison. He was met by chilliness and occasional condemnation by the Biden administration and certainly their allies in the media.\n\nThe result of the Biden administration’s efforts—if you could really call them that—was years of record-breaking crossings at the southern border that continued nearly unabated until Trump arrived back in office.\n\nEl Salvador improved dramatically despite the frosty relationship with the U.S. government and went from “murder capital” to being one of the safest countries in the region. The explosive migration of the country has reversed, and many people are even voluntarily returning home. They are doing what every left-leaning government, seemingly across the globe, says can’t be done. They are arresting their way out of a crime crisis. And it seems to be working pretty well.\n\nTrump is doubling down on that anti-crime impulse. Instead of putting out insipid statements about “democracy” and giving South American countries handouts they are likely to waste, he is targeting the source of their dysfunction.\n\nClearly, enforcing border laws and deporting those who broke them is having a huge impact on the border crisis, which has seemingly disappeared. But the president is willing to go a step further to ensure that the long-term problem is further mitigated by focusing on stopping crime, halting the flow of drugs, and putting the screws on hostile leftist governments. \n\nIt seems to be working.","summary":"President Donald Trump is truly addressing the “root causes” of our border problem.

The formerly Democratic press secretary explained the title earlier this year, stating that she’d left the party after its institutional failure in 2024.\n\nDuring interviews on the anti-Trump news site The Bulwark and CBS Mornings, Jean-Pierre took some of the toughest questions yet to be faced by anyone who was at Biden’s side during the collapse of his presidential campaign and the disastrous debate in June when he appeared confused, often lost track of what he was saying and appeared faint, even whispery compared to Donald Trump. \n\nHer appearances coincide with Harris’ own media tour, which began in September as Harris promotes the tale of her ascendancy to the top of the Democratic ticket in 2025.\n\nJean-Pierre struggled in both settings to defend her old boss’s decision-making, particularly under a barrage of questions from The Bulwark’s Tim Miller regarding an anecdote from Harris’s 107 Days memoir in which the vice president detailed a pre-debate phone call from Biden complaining that members of her team were supposedly criticizing him. According to Harris, she was unsure if her own boss was in that moment trying to deliberately sabotage her by psyching her out — or, merely doing so unintentionally.\n\nMiller, in his line of questioning, pressed Jean-Pierre to explain how her former boss prioritized the election over his own ego and public image, if he did so at all.\n\n“I look back at [the questions of loyalty to Biden] and think, man, wasn't there too much emphasis on Joe Biden and Joe Biden's legacy? And not enough on setting the party up to succeed, on setting Kamala Harris up to succeed?” Miller asked, noting that many in Harris’s circle (including the candidate herself) seemingly felt that way. \n\nJean-Pierre responded that she couldn’t “speak to her experience”, before Miller pressed her for answers. As an example of how Biden supposedly put his own self-interest above Harris’s after “stepping aside” from the Democratic ticket, Miller said: “he story-- he called her before the debate to say that people were being mean to him? Like what is happening? What is happening? That is insane! That is an insane thing to do!”\n\n“Hold on a second, Tim,” she responded. “You’re talking about her experience-- I can’t speak to that.”\n\n“But you were around,” Miller replied, with some sarcasm.\n\nJean-Pierre could respond only by saying that Biden’s legacy was not her focus as his press secretary, which she said had been on the administration’s work for the American people.\n\nBut she was similarly evasive on CBS when asked about something she should be able to speak to: her own perception of the president as she traveled with him on Air Force One ahead of the campaign-ending June debate with Donald Trump. Jean-Pierre claimed that she “didn’t really see him until after the debate,” a statement that would be hard to believe coming from any press secretary but particularly from one set to speak for the president as he returned from a foreign trip and was preparing for a major televised clash with his political opponent.\n\nGayle King, reading from Jean-Pierre’s book, explained that she had just one simple question in response to the press secretary’s claim that she hadn’t seen Biden’s noticeable mental and physical decline, seemingly picked up on by millions of Americans not in the room: “How?!”\n\n“So really, I want everybody to know that I take this question incredibly seriously,” responded Jean-Pierre. “I was his White House press secretary, which means I had a role that saw him practically every day.”\n\nBut, she added, “I never saw someone who ‘wasn’t there.’ I saw someone who was always engaged. I saw someone who understood policy; pushed us on the policy. And also understood history.”\n\nHer statements, if an accurate depiction of her experience, only serve to reinforce the narrative that Joe Biden’s presidency and campaign was isolated at the highest levels from the true extent of the president’s declining mental acuity and ability to present himself to the public, as well as the earnestness of the criticism surrounding those issues. \n\nThere’s still no real explanation from anyone inside Bidenworld as to why it was too late to save the party from defeat by the time anyone in that circle was listening to the deafening calls for a new candidate, weeks after the president declared onstage to millions of Americans that his administration “beat Medicare”.\n\nThose questions are widely thought to have contributed to Harris’s decision not to run for governor of California next year. She’s still considered a possible contender for the Democratic Party presidential nomination in 2028, but has gone nearly a year since her defeat without answering tough questions from journalists about her last year in the Biden administration. Other Democrats who worked in top positions in the former the administration are now similarly dodging interviews.\n\nThe former vice president wrote in her book that she felt that Biden’s team — including the press shop of which Karine Jean-Piere was a member — hung her out to dry, explaining that she found “getting anything positive said about my work or any defense against untrue attacks [to be] almost impossible.”\n\n“Worse, I often learned that the president’s staff was adding fuel to negative narratives that sprang up around me. One narrative that took a stubborn hold was that I had a ‘chaotic’ office and unusually high staff turnover during my first year,” claimed Harris in 107 Days. “Their thinking was zero-sum: If she’s shining, he’s dimmed. None of them grasped that if I did well, he did well.”\n\nBiden, who recently entered radiation therapy treatment for prostate cancer, spoke about his decision to step down earlier this year.\n\n“I don’t think it would have mattered” had he dropped out sooner to let the Democrats find another candidate, the president said. \"Things moved so quickly that it made it difficult to walk away. And it was a hard decision...I think it was the right decision...[But] it was just a difficult decision.\"","summary":"Jean-Pierre says she ‘never saw’ a president in decline and wasn’t even with him before disastrous June debate with Trump","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/biden-karine-jean-pierre-harris-debate-b2848829.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/12/14/55/Former-Biden-administration-White-House-press-secretary-Karine-Jean-Pierre-arrives-to-sit-for-a-clos.jpeg?crop=4645,3096.7,x0,y0.2&trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/esrGvv8y-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-20 20:46:46","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.415},{"id":371043864,"title":"Jean-Pierre cannot be trusted for ‘leading the lie’ on Biden: Joe Concha","text":"Concha, however, was not sold on Jean-Pierre’s argument, calling it “insulting” for anyone who is “sane.” He also compared Jean-Pierre to former Vice President Kamala Harris in portraying herself as a “victim.”\n\n“She’s an Independent?

Newsom’s maps would give them a progressive, gay congressman","text":"By Maya C. Miller, CalMatters\n\nCalifornia may have a reputation as a bastion of blue, but there are only so many Democratic voters to go around.\n\nUnder Proposition 50, Gov. Gavin Newsom’s plan to gerrymander California’s congressional maps to favor Democrats, no incumbent Democrat would take on more Republican voters than Rep. Robert Garcia of Long Beach.\n\nRELATED: First Bay Area D.A. joins 29 others across California opposing Prop. 50\n\nGarcia’s new district, rather than stretching north from his home town into liberal Los Angeles County, would instead shift southward to encompass a coastal slice of conservative Orange County — notably, the conservative-leaning cities of Huntington Beach and Newport Beach.\n\nAbsorbing those GOP voters into the 42nd congressional district is a point of pride for the 47-year-old Peruvian immigrant, a gay progressive whose sharp-tongued condemnations of President Donald Trump and Elon Musk catapulted him into party leadership as the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, the chamber’s main investigative arm.\n\nHe also serves on the committee’s viral “DOGE” subgroup, where he and a group of fellow young progressives use their speaking time to lob sardonic rhetorical questions that cast the proceedings and the chairwoman, Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, as absurd and even laughable.\n\n“Are Bert and Ernie part of an extreme homosexual agenda?” Garcia asked Paula Kerger, president and CEO of the Public Broadcasting Service, during a hearing in March as his staffer held up a life-sized image of the beloved muppet duo.\n\nIf his party retakes control of the House next year, Garcia would almost certainly ascend to chair the committee, which has vast subpoena powers, and would become the face of congressional Democrats’ resistance to Trump.\n\nBut don’t expect Garcia, a former Long Beach mayor and city councilor, to back down from his anti-MAGA bully pulpit just because he would then represent a town whose city council has embraced the moniker “the MAGA-nificent seven.”\n\n“Folks have asked, ‘Hey, you know, you’re pretty progressive. Is this gonna impact the way you take on Trump or the oversight committee?’” Garcia told political commentator Katie Phang during a virtual fundraiser for Prop. 50 last month.\n\n“Absolutely not,” he said.\n\nGarcia’s certainty that he’ll win re-election next year, regardless of which maps are used, is precisely the problem with creating noncompetitive districts as Prop. 50 proposes to do, said state Sen. Tony Strickland, a Republican former mayor of Huntington Beach.\n\nThe city is currently represented by a Democratic congressmember, Rep. Dave Min of Irvine, who succeeded Democrat Katie Porter when she unsuccessfully ran for U.S. Senate last year. But since the district is currently drawn as a competitive seat, Strickland said, Min must win favor from at least some conservative voters if he wants to stay in office. That wouldn’t be the case for Garcia, should Prop. 50 pass.\n\nStrickland and other local officials in coastal Orange County are skeptical that Garcia — a former Long Beach mayor who said he’s thrilled that his new district would include the entire city — will prioritize their cities’ needs, especially if he doesn’t need their votes to win.\n\n“The problem with Prop. 50 is you have predetermined elections. You already know who your congressman is before election day,” Strickland said. “As a pretty conservative city, both Newport and Huntington will have one of the most liberal members of Congress. And I just don’t think that’s healthy.”\n\n“We want to govern ourselves”\n\nWhile Huntington Beach has long asserted its conservative tilt by resisting compliance with state laws they view as too liberal (such as housing construction requirements), the city in recent years has embraced the national culture wars and grabbed headlines for leading a conservative backlash to the state’s ruling Democrats in Sacramento.\n\nResidents last March approved a ban on flying the rainbow LGBTQ Pride flag on city property. They greenlit a controversial ordinance requiring voters to bring ID to vote, which Attorney General Rob Bonta and Secretary of State Shirley Weber argue violates state election laws. (Oral arguments before an appeals court are scheduled for Oct. 22).\n\nAnd a simmering battle over sexual content in children’s books and Huntington Beach’s public library came to a head in June.\n\nThe city council had previously approved a controversial ordinance establishing a community review board for library books — what critics dubbed a book ban — and also briefly explored privatizing the library, policies they saw as a counterbalance to the state Legislature’s ultraliberal, “woke” laws. But this summer, via special election, voters overwhelmingly supported repealing the review board and limited the city’s ability to outsource library services.\n\n“We really just want home control. We want to govern ourselves,” said Huntington Beach Mayor Pat Burns. He doesn’t know Garcia personally, but as a former police officer in Long Beach he’s familiar with the former councilmember’s left-leaning politics.\n\n“Hopefully he’s open to helping us, but if he comes in and tries to break us, you know, break our community and try to crush our council in some way,” Burns said, speaking of Garcia, “well, we’re going to resist. We’re not going to get along.”\n\nGarcia argues that the successful repudiation of the library crackdown is evidence that the city council’s right-wing approach doesn’t fully represent residents’ values.\n\n“The vast majority of Huntington Beach are good, hard-working, middle-class folks that want a just future for themselves,” Garcia told CalMatters in an interview. “That’s who I’m gonna represent.”\n\nGarcia reiterated that he’s unafraid to speak out, even when he disagrees with decisions made in cities that he represents. Even so, he said he would be proud to represent everyone in his proposed new district and would fight hard to bring federal dollars home to support local projects. He said he would prioritize issues that “everyone cares about,” such as increased affordability, combating climate change and curbing corruption.\n\nStill, Garcia also repeatedly noted that the proposed district would still be solidly Democratic. He effused confidence that he would handily win re-election next year and, he hopes, help Democrats retake control of the House.\n\nDemocrats have come under fire for drawing the new maps behind closed doors without input from the public or the independent citizens redistricting commission. But Paul Mitchell, the election data guru and redistricting expert who penned the proposed maps, said that in redrawing Garcia’s district to include coastal Orange County, he and his team hewed closely to proposals that advocacy groups previously presented to the independent commission.\n\nMoving Garcia’s district to Orange County was crucial to shore up support for three vulnerable Democrats — Min along with Representatives Derek Tran and Mike Levin — and creating two newly redrawn districts, currently held by Republican representatives Ken Calvert and Darrell Issa, that Democrats believe they can flip.\n\n“That was a critical piece of the puzzle,” Mitchell said in an interview. “It facilitates everything in Southern California.”\n\nFellow California Democrats have sung Garcia’s praises for graciously allowing his district to go from one that Vice President Kamala Harris won by more than 32% last November to one in which Democrats only have a 10 percentage point registration advantage.\n\n“Robert Garcia is an incredible team player,” said Rep. Zoe Lofgren, chair of California’s Democratic congressional delegation, in a written statement. “He’s taking in some historically Republican neighborhoods, but it’s still going to be a Democratic district.”\n\nDuring the same virtual fundraiser in September, Garcia told viewers that taking on more Republican voters was “the right thing to do” because “our democracy’s at stake.”\n\n“This is not a moment for us to worry about not having competitive seats or about being in Congress for a lifetime,” Garcia said. “This is about winning the majority to protect people and to save our country.”","summary":"Huntington Beach and its all-Republican city council have proudly led California’s conservative resistance.

Another CBS News employee labelled her push to out leakers as “hilarious.”\n\nThe Independent has contacted CBS News and Weiss for comment.\n\nEven before Paramount chairman David Ellison installed Weiss as the Tiffany Network’s top editor, and bought her “heterodox” website for $150 million, many CBS staff had expressed serious reservations about her potential reign over the large broadcast news operation.\n\n“It’s not a good place right now,” one CBS News staffer told The Independent, days before Weiss was officially hired. “There was a proper way to do this and a not proper way, and they're doing it in the non-proper way, and maybe that's by design.”\n\nOnce Weiss was announced as editorial leader of the news division - while also remaining The Free Press’ CEO and editor-in-chief - reporters and staffers spoke out en masse to multiple media publications about the atmosphere behind-the-scenes at CBS News. They also provided copies of staff-wide memos and details of news calls and meetings.\n\nAfter Weiss’ first editorial meeting included a “Sorkinesque” call to journalistic arms, multiple staffers told The Independent that employees were literally rolling their eyes at her “cringey” rallying cry. \n\nDays later, when she sent out an email urging all CBS News employees to provide her with a memo laying out their work day, insiders compared Weiss’ request to Elon Musk’s directive while working for the Trump administration at the Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nAs the Times previously noted, Weiss – a self-described “radical centrist” who has long warned about the excesses of the “woke left” – The Free Press published leaked recordings of an internal CBS News editorial meeting last year. That meeting was centered on internal backlash over Dokoupil’s interview with Coates, where the news anchor claimed the author’s book on Israel’s treatment of Palestinians “would not be out of place in the backpack of an extremist.”\n\nIn multiple Free Press articles, which included anonymous quotes and leaked details, Weiss – who labels herself a “Zionist fanatic” – and others at the outlet took aim at CBS News’ reprimand of Dokoupil over the interview, claiming that it showed the network had an anti-Israel bias. \n\n“There are some people at CBS who think that ‘Israel’s existence as a state should be part of fair conversation,’ said one CBS source,” Weiss wrote in one piece. “Can you imagine journalists having that conversation about any other country?”\n\nIn 2020, shortly before she resigned as an opinion editor and writer for The New York Times due to its “illiberal environment,” Weiss live-tweeted a heated internal meeting that took place at the paper over its decision to publish a controversial op-ed by Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton.\n\nThe juxtaposition of Weiss leaning on CBS News leaks last year to frame the network in a negative light, and demanding that those leaks stop now that she’s in charge at the network, hasn’t been lost on the newsroom.\n\n“Insanely ironic Weiss is whining about leakers when her rag leaked audio of our 9 am editorial over Dokoupil, and now she expects it to be a safe place after rendering it unsafe herself?” the senior CBS News staffer rhetorically asked.\n\nThe same source claimed that Weiss had initially “loved all the media attention and seeing her name everywhere,” following the announcement of her hiring. However, with headlines growing increasingly critical, “now she wants the ‘leakers’ shut down or sacked.”\n\nUltimately, as the insider noted, Weiss should have fully expected this situation at CBS, considering the turmoil that’s rocked the news division over the past few years.\n\n“If she took 5 seconds to learn anything about CBS News before joining, she’d know it’s been through so much change and tumult over the past 5 years, really since Charlie Rose’s #metoo ouster, that it’s become one of the leakiest news divisions in America - including to her,” the staffer said, referencing the veteran journalist’s ouster as morning host following sexual misconduct allegations. \n\nThis was largely echoed by another network reporter, who told The Independent that Weiss’ sale of her Substack-based website would likely not have been possible if it weren’t for her CBS stories.\n\n“Hilarious. She’s literally a millionaire because she used leaked audio to help her catch the eye of David Ellison,” the reporter noted. “This place is leakier than the Titanic. Good luck trying to plug all the holes.”\n\nBesides the Dokoupil kerfuffle, The Free Press’ editorial board also took CBS News to task last October over 60 Minutes’ editing of its interview with Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, which prompted President Donald Trump to sue the network for supposedly interfering with the 2024 election.\n\nIn the op-ed, The Free Press accused the network of having “concocted a deception” while urging 60 Minutes to release the entire, unedited interview and transcript. CBS News said that it had followed the network’s standard editing practices and that the president’s allegations were without merit. \n\nIn the end, parent company Paramount agreed to pay Trump $16 million to settle the lawsuit just weeks before his administration approved the company’s $8 billion merger with Ellison’s Skydance Media. Paramount’s settlement negotiations with Trump’s legal team, amid its push to finalize its merger, also eventually resulted in resignations of several newsroom leaders and executives.\n\nBeyond the leaks, a growing question among CBS News staff is how Weiss plans to balance her duties as leader of The Free Press and editorial chief of the network.\n\n“In the two weeks that she has worked at the network, Ms. Weiss has not promoted any articles or reporting from CBS News on her X account, which reaches 1.1 million followers. She added her CBS title into her X bio on Friday,” the New York Times pointed out.\n\n“As a Middle East peace deal came into view, Ms. Weiss shared numerous pro-Israel opinion pieces from The Free Press, and an editorial that said Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for New York City mayor, had failed ‘the Hamas test,’” the Times added. \n\n“CBS News declined to comment on whether Ms. Weiss’s expression of strong opinions on major news events ran afoul of its ethics rules, or belied CBS News’s efforts to appear nonpartisan.”\n\nAs for Weiss’ hopes that the company would be able to keep internal communications private, it was crystal clear Monday that the leaks would continue after an email to staff, from Paramount executives Jeff Shell and George Cheeks, was shared withThe Independent and other media outlets. \n\nIn the memo, the executives detailed the role of new CBS News ombudsman Kenneth Weinstein, which would feature Weiss potentially working to “recommend and implement appropriate next steps” regarding any “complaints of bias” at the network.","summary":"One CBS News staffer told The Independent that it was ‘insanely ironic’ that Weiss, the network’s new editor-in-chief, was trying to out leakers","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/bari-weiss-cbs-news-leaks-b2848653.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/06/15/11/Media-CBS-Weiss-3w7cb8vc.jpeg?crop=1054,702.7,x0,y0.2&trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-20 16:35:03","author":"Justin Baragona","authors":["Justin Baragona"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.062},{"id":371037050,"title":"Elizabeth Warren Says Companies That Settled With Trump May Have Committed Bribery","text":"During his second term in office, several major media organizations have settled lawsuits brought by President Donald Trump. The lawsuits have little or no merit, and the settlements clearly seem like payoffs meant to hold off a vengeful president. Now Senate Democrats are investigating whether the settlements amount to bribery.\n\n\"We write seeking information on Google subsidiary YouTube's $22 million settlement with President Trump, and on how the decision may relate to regulatory issues pending with the Trump administration,\" began a letter last week from lawmakers—chief among them Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D–Mass.)—to Google CEO Sundar Pichai and YouTube CEO Neal Mohan.\n\nIn January 2021, YouTube suspended Trump's account after the January 6 Capitol riot; Twitter and Facebook did the same. Trump later sued all three companies, saying the suspensions constituted \"illegal, shameful censorship.\" The lawsuits were frivolous on their face—private companies are free to decide whom to allow or exclude from their platforms—but all three companies settled once Trump reentered office. Last month, more than two years after it reinstated his account, YouTube agreed to pay $24.5 million to settle the lawsuit. The bulk of it went to Trump, which he said he would earmark for a new ballroom he is building at the White House.\n\nThe lawmakers wrote to Pichai and Mohan in August, when it appeared YouTube may settle. Google, they noted, faced a number of potential regulatory hurdles as well as labor and antitrust actions. \"Google stands to benefit from how the federal government proceeds in these matters, and Google may settle this lawsuit in the hopes of securing outcomes favorable to the company,\" the letter warned. \"Under the federal bribery statute, it is illegal to corruptly give anything of value to public officials with the intent to influence an official act.\" (In a brief two-page reply, Google noted \"the Company's commitment to comply with both U.S. and non-U.S. laws and regulations\" and clarified that talks were still ongoing.)\n\nIn last week's follow-up letter, Warren—along with Sens. Ron Wyden (D–Ore.), Bernie Sanders (I–Vt.), Richard Blumenthal (D–Ct.), and Jeff Merkeley (D–Ore.)—asked, in light of the settlement, to know more about the negotiations. Among other things, they asked whether Google and YouTube were \"engaging the Trump administration in any way to secure favorable treatment in any pending legal or enforcement matters or potential future matters.\"\n\nGoogle was not the only example.\n\nDuring the 2024 election, Trump complained when CBS lightly edited a 60 Minutes interview with his opponent, then–Vice President Kamala Harris, by airing only part of her answer to a question in the primetime broadcast. In October 2024, he sued CBS and its parent company, Paramount, seeking $10 billion in damages—later increased to $20 billion—saying the minor edits caused \"confusion and mental anguish\" for him and for viewers. CBS called the lawsuit \"completely without merit.\"\n\nLegally, Trump had no leg to stand on: Even substantive edits to news broadcasts are fully within an outlet's discretion, according to the U.S. Supreme Court. CBS later released a transcript and raw footage of the interview, proving there was no substance to the controversy in the first place.\n\nBut in July 2025, Paramount agreed to pay $16 million to settle the lawsuit. This was better than what Trump had reportedly demanded—$25 million and an apology—but it was still a shameful outcome for one of the most prominent journalistic outlets in the country.\n\nThe decision likely stemmed, at least in part, from the fact that Paramount needed the Trump administration's approval to finalize an $8 billion merger with Skydance Media. The Federal Communications Commission approved the merger on July 24, just three weeks after Paramount agreed to settle the lawsuit and two days after Skydance pledged that as Paramount's new owner, it would install an \"ombudsman\" to \"receive and evaluate any complaints of bias or other concerns involving CBS.\"\n\nIn a May letter, Warren and other Democratic lawmakers cautioned Paramount about settling Trump's lawsuit and acceding to his government's demands \"in exchange for approval of its megamerger\" with Skydance. \"Under the federal bribery statute, it is illegal to corruptly give anything of value to public officials to influence an official act,\" they wrote. \"If Paramount officials make these concessions in a quid pro quo arrangement to influence President Trump or other Administration officials, they may be breaking the law.\"\n\nThis was apparently not news to Paramount. All the way back in February, The Wall Street Journal's Jessica Tonkel reported the company was \"wrestling\" with how to settle the lawsuit, \"and how it might do so without exposing executives to future legal threats, such as accusations of bribery.\"\n\nThe lawmakers also asked if Skydance made any sort of \"side deal\" with Trump, wherein the company agreed to certain concessions in exchange for merger approval. \"The public deserves to know which White House officials met with Skydance executives, and if Skydance cut a side deal with the President in order to grease the skids for its merger approval,\" Warren, Sanders, and Wyden wrote in a letter last week.\n\nThe senators were not alone. After the merger, the nonprofit organization Free Speech for People \"called on\" the attorneys general of New York and California \"to determine whether Trump, senior administration officials, and Trump's personal associates violated state laws and, if warranted, to bring criminal charges.\"\n\nIt's unlikely the bribery allegations will bear fruit. \"An offer made merely to ingratiate or with a generalized hope of future official benefit is insufficient. Bribery law requires an unambiguous intent to influence a public official's action through money or something else of value,\" wrote John Keller, an attorney who previously headed the Department of Justice Public Integrity Section, in a post at Lawfare. \"Without the requirement of an actual offer, every company or individual with any business pending before the federal government would be subject to a bribery charge for any commercial or personal dealings with Trump or his expansive network of businesses that appeared favorable to the president.\"\n\nLegal or not, it's completely inappropriate for the sitting president to sue media companies he doesn't like and use the levers of government to force them to settle. While it may not meet the statutory definition of bribery, lawmakers are right to probe both the administration and the companies Trump has targeted.","summary":"While the settlements likely don't meet the statutory definition of bribery, they're still inappropriate.","url":"https://reason.com/2025/10/20/elizabeth-warren-says-companies-that-settled-with-trump-may-have-committed-bribery/","image":"https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/elizabeth-warren-facebook-paramount-1200x675.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-20 16:30:34","author":"Autumn Billings,Joe Lancaster","authors":["Autumn Billings","Joe Lancaster"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.284},{"id":371039398,"title":"Don't count Katie Porter out of the governor's race just yet","text":"Oh my god, you guys! Did you hear about that brat Katie Porter? Swear to God on a stack of holy Bibles, she is such a mean girl! She can never be governor of California! And she’s not gonna make fetch happen, either! All right, can we please grow up for a minute here? Like a lot of ambitious politicians, Katie Porter, the former Democratic congresswoman and UC Irvine law professor now running to succeed California Gov. Gavin Newsom in 2026, has a temper. Porter, a protegé of Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the relentless consumer advocate, rose to fame during her three terms in Congress. She was dubbed the “whiteboard warrior” for using that common classroom tool to simplify complex financial issues during hearings. She took corporate titans like Jamie Dimon to task like a boss. Porter's star was briefly dimmed by a loss to Adam Schiff in last year's U.S. Senate race, but when she announced her run for governor, she instantly became the front-runner in a crowded Democratic field. . Understandably, Porter's rivals have been waiting for the chance to knock her down a peg. Recently, she delivered that opportunity to them. In a television interview with CBS News Sacramento correspondent Julia Watts, Porter got snippy. She decided, for whatever reason, that she did not want to keep answering questions about how she would appeal to the 40% of California voters who supported President Trump. “How would I need them in order to win, ma’am?” Porter asked. “Unless you think you are going to get 60% of the vote,\" Watts pressed, \"everybody who did not vote for Trump will vote for you?” “In a general election?” Porter asked. “Yes.” “We’ve also asked the other candidates, do you think you need those 40% of California voters to win,” Watts said, “and you’re saying no you don’t.” “I’m saying I’m gonna try to win every vote I can,” Porter replied. “And what I’m saying to you is …” At that point, she threw up her hands. “I don’t want to keep doing this. I’m gonna call it, thank you,” said Porter, who removed her microphone, telling Watts she didn’t want to answer “seven follow-ups to every question you ask.” Porter didn’t yell or throw a punch. She just seemed fed up. Running for office can be a slog, and sometimes you just don’t feel like answering the same question over and over. Not that Watts was out of line. She absolutely wasn’t. However — and this is not a minor detail — despite what some outlets such as the Daily Beast reported, Porter did not “storm out” of the interview. Both CBS and her campaign said she spent another 20 minutes talking to Watts. But the viral die was cast. Shortly thereafter, Politico obtained a 2021 clip of Porter berating a staffer as she was being interviewed by then-Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm over Zoom. The staffer interrupted to correct something Porter said about electric vehicles. “Get out of my [effing] shot!” Porter demanded. Mean and cringey, for sure. And lest the pile-on end there, we have also been reminded — by the New York Post — that years ago, Porter's ex-husband accused her of verbal and physical abuse, alleging she dumped hot mashed potatoes on his head during a fight. This is ludicrous. As Porter recounts in her 2023 memoir, \"I Swear: Politics Is Messier Than My Minivan,\" in divorce documents and in a long 2018 interview with the Huffington Post at the dawn of her political career, Porter was abused by her ex-husband, who in turn accused her of abuse just before the hearing on her application for a restraining order. As recounted in the HuffPo story, while she was flossing her teeth one evening, her husband barged into the bathroom, ripped away the floss, “then punched the wall so hard he shattered the face plate of the light switch and knocked the lights out. He would later tell a judge he was angry because his wife had been brushing her teeth too slowly.” There were calls to 911 and at one point, Porter took her three young kids into hiding. She only went public with her humiliating divorce story because someone who was a supporter of one of her 2018 Democratic rivals called her “Katie ‘Restraining Order’ Porter” on Twitter. On the advice of her political consultant Ace Smith, she released her divorce files to quell any rumor mongering. It's fair to say Porter's personal life has been messy. Last year, she sought and received a restraining order against a former boyfriend for sending her hundreds of \"threatening and harassing\" messages. Still, her unfortunate outburst with the CBS reporter gave her competitors a long-sought opening. “Katie Porter is a weak, self-destructive candidate unfit to lead California,” wrote former state Controller Betty Yee on X. “The stakes are simply too high for her to stay in this race.” Pundits and talk show panelists held forth on how the kerfuffle would affect her campaign. Most seem to agree it was bad news for Porter, and also that it has cemented her reputation as a bad boss. Porter has apologized, and has vowed to do better, though she has dodged questions about whether there will be more videos of her behaving badly. Frankly, I'm not so sure this is a death blow for her campaign. It’s true that female candidates are held to a higher standard of behavior than male candidates: Kamala Harris laughed too much! Hillary Clinton was too programmed! Elizabeth Warren was too shrill! Women are not allowed to be too emotional, or God forbid, angry. But times have shown that voters can forgive a candidate’s bad behavior if they like what she stands for, and if they believe she has their best interests at heart. Especially now, Democrats want fighters like Newsom and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, who have become national stars for leading the resistance against Trump and his autocratic overreaches. It’s also fair to say that in a thus-far-sleepy governor’s race, California voters have suddenly perked up. If they didn’t know Katie Porter’s name before, they sure do now.

Ruben Gallego Tells Party Only Way To Win — Forget Obama, Be More Like Trump","text":"One Senate Democrat offers some tough love to his party, urging members to shift away from the Obama-era insanity and embrace President Donald Trump’s playbook.\n\nSen. Ruben Gallego positioned himself as a pragmatic Democrat in a New York Times podcast interview Monday, one who broke with his party’s narrative on key voter issues in 2024, allowing him to win his seat in the Republican-leaning state of Arizona\n\nTrump beat former Vice President Kamala Harris by 5.5 points in Arizona in 2024. Still, Gallego attributed his Senate win to him prioritizing voter concerns like economic affordability and border security over traditional Democrat priorities, such as abortion and threats to democracy.\n\nGallego urged his party to shift toward messages of prosperity rather than the equity or justice narrative that became popular among Democrats during the Obama administration and was the focal point of the Harris campaign. He believes his winning strategy could be the blueprint for a Democratic Party revival, contrasting it with far-left figures like New York’s Democratic Socialist mayoral candidate, Zohran Mamdani.\n\nAlthough he doesn’t blatantly admit that he wants Democrats running Trump’s playbook, he repeatedly aligns his policy stances with elements of Trump’s successful 2024 campaign. He emphasizes that the winning messages, especially for Latino voters, are tough border enforcement, economic opportunity through personal success, and a rejection of Democrat’s typical left-wing messaging. (Sign up for Mary Rooke’s weekly newsletter here!)\n\n“They wanted to talk about abortion and democracy … But what we were seeing on the ground in Arizona was that people were worried about being able to make the rent; they were worried about border security,” he said.\n\nThroughout the interview, Gallego distances himself from core Democrat issues, such as expansive social equity programs, identity-focused language, and prioritizing cultural battles over kitchen-table economics.\n\nGallego frames border insecurity as intertwined with economic decline, much like Trump’s rallies where he linked illegal immigration to job losses and crime. He stressed that Harris’ weakness on border security was a decisive factor in her Arizona loss because voters were deeply concerned about the safety and economic hardship brought on by unchecked illegal immigration during the Biden administration.\n\n“We were very real about what was actually happening on the ground, and we didn’t lie to ourselves. I think a lot of Democrats running — and it wasn’t just Vice President Harris — they wanted to talk about the things they were comfortable talking about. They didn’t want to go to where the voter was,” he said.\n\nHe added that voters “were worried about border security; and they were worried about what is truly happening to the American dream,” and Democrats reluctancy to talk about these issues made them seem “extremely out of touch” to everyday Americans.\n\n“Democrats sound too much like Harvard professors and not enough like Marine Corps members,” Gallego said.\n\nHe argued that other Democrats assume working-class voters “don’t want to be prosperous, they don’t want to be rich, or they don’t want to be successful,” leading voters feeling left behind to Trump’s promises to fix the economy, border, and foreign policies that hinder their access to the American Dream.\n\n 🚨NEW: Stephen A. Smith WARNS Dems will be *DOOMED* if they become like Zohran Mamdani🚨 “If the Democratic Party becomes him, you have no chance. You have no chance — on a national basis in terms of the presidency. In Senate seats, seats in the House — you have no chance.”… pic.twitter.com/12dQ7J2OlN — Jason Cohen 🇺🇸 (@JasonJournoDC) July 1, 2025\n\nGallego criticizes Democrats for fixating on “economic equity” and “ideas of essentially trying to equalize capitalism,” calling it “nebulous” and unappealing. He wants his party to reject from Democratic staples like wealth redistribution, universal basic income, or racial equity initiatives, which are top campaign promises from candidates like Mamdani. Instead Gallego wants other Democrats to focus on tangible goals like homeownership and business startups over broad social programs.\n\n“What I’ve heard coming from the Democratic side … is that they talk about economic equity… And that’s just not how people think,” he said. (ROOKE: Trump Fights Media On Goldilocks Issue, But Americans Tell Him He’s Got It Just Right)\n\nTo Gallego’s credit, he is focused on important voter issues. He banned his campaign from using the extremely unpopular “Latinx” term and talked to regular Americans about their personal financial concerns, which is exactly how Trump won back the White House. Much like with Democratic Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman, this move to the middle isn’t going to make him popular among his party’s far left base.\n\nStill, if Democrats don’t listen to their party’s center, it’s hard to see the 2026 midterms being any different than 2024.\n\nFollow Mary Rooke on X: @MaryRooke\n\nSign up for Mary Rooke’s weekly newsletter here!","summary":"'Democrats sound too much like Harvard professors'","url":"https://dailycaller.com/2025/10/20/rooke-senate-democrats-trump-obama-kamala-harris-ruben-gallego-arizona-voters-immigration-border-polls/","image":"https://images.dailycaller.com/image/width=1280,height=549,fit=cover,format=webp,f=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn01.dailycaller.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2025%2F10%2FGettyImages-2205111498-e1760974433632.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-20 15:59:43","author":"Mary Rooke","authors":["Mary Rooke"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.106},{"id":371017126,"title":"As public media funds officially dry up, local radio stations struggle","text":"For Scott Smith, the cuts to the Corporation For Public Broadcasting are existential.\n\nHe is the general manager of Allegheny Mountain Radio, which he runs alongside programme manager Heather Nidly. The funds were slashed as part of United States President Donald Trump’s vast tax cut and spending bill that was signed into law in July. As a result, the station, which has been on air for more than four decades, lost 65 percent of its funding.\n\n“We are here to serve our communities and to fulfill our mission of giving them news, giving them entertainment, giving them emergency alerts and giving them school closings. We do lost and found pet notices. We do funeral announcements. We have a listing of community events that is read multiple times a day. We do weather forecasts. We’re a critical part of the community,” Smith told Al Jazeera.\n\nThe rescissions bill that Trump signed allows the US Congress to claw back funding that had been approved and pulls back $9bn in funding, including $1bn from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CFB). At the end of September, those funds officially dried up.\n\nThe money had already been allocated by the previous Congress to fund public media for 2026 and 2027. Now stations are scrambling to find ways to fill the holes.\n\nThe Trump administration has gone after news organisations that have presented any critical coverage of him, including the Wall Street Journal, after its coverage of a suggestive letter purportedly written by Trump to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein for his birthday. In September, he tried to sue The New York Times for allegedly being a “virtual mouthpiece” for the Democratic Party.\n\nHis leverage over public media is significant because that is partially funded by federal tax dollars. The White House first signed an executive order to defund public media in May. That was quickly blocked because funding decisions are made by Congress, not the White House.\n\nNext, Trump pressured Congressional Republicans to put forth the rescissions bill that fulfilled the mission of his previous executive order. To justify his call for cuts, in May, the White House released a list of segments from NPR and PBS programmes that it says had liberal bias, as it included many segments about the experience of the trans community.\n\nThe White House also cited a report alleging PBS favoured Democrats. That report was from the openly partisan Media Research Center, which has a stated goal to promote conservative values.\n\nA key, but overlooked, problem with the cuts is that they overwhelmingly harm stations that do not even cover the White House or much national politics at all.\n\nAllegheny Mountain Radio (AMR) is one of those stations. Comprising three affiliates for three counties straddling the West Virginia and Virginia border, on their airwaves, listeners will find gospel, folk and country music, as well as coverage of local football games and town hall meetings.\n\nAMR carries NPR’s national newscast and, more importantly, serves as the on-the-ground voice when severe weather hits.\n\nUnlike in other regions of the county, there is no other alternative to get real-time local news. The nearest local news station is several hours away, separated by winding country roads. When there’s severe weather, AMR is the only way locals get vital information like road closure announcements because of floodwaters.\n\n“Just a few years ago, we had a deluge of rain coming down and flooding parts of the county. At that point, when something like that happens, the radio station really is the only way to get that information out quickly to our listeners and let them know where it’s happening,” AMR programme manager Nidly told Al Jazeera.\n\nAMR is in a part of the country where cellphone signal and wireless access are sparse because of its proximity to what is called the National Radio Quiet Zone (NRQZ) near the Green Bank Observatory, which limits the use of radio frequency and other signal methods so that they do not interfere with their equipment. This requires special equipment to point radio signals away from the observatory.\n\nWith the region’s low population density, there’s a limited business case for a station. But there is a case for public service. The community depends on AMR for emergency alerts – even on a personal level. During major storms, Smith said, people have shown up at their stations when their phones stopped working, asking if AMR could broadcast a message to let their family and friends know they were safe.\n\nDespite their strong community focus, these stations may not benefit from the same level of donor support seen by larger public stations across the country, due to limited local enterprise and resources.\n\nIt is trying. In order to stay afloat, the station is actively soliciting donations on its website.\n\nWhile small community stations – like those serving Bath and Pocahontas Counties in West Virginia, and Highland County, Virginia, through AMR – don’t produce national newscasts or air segments that ruffle feathers in Washington, they are still the ones that are most at risk of being hit hardest.\n\n“Small stations like ours are the ones who will suffer because of these cuts. We feel like we are the baby that got thrown out with the bathwater because there’s so much emphasis on the talking points around NPR and PBS. It’s like the rest of us, the small community stations, have absolutely been forgotten in this equation,” Smith told Al Jazeera.\n\nThe cuts, however, hit stations across the US in big markets too. WNYC in New York City lost 4 percent of its funding. WBUR in Boston, San Francisco’s KLAW, and KERA in Dallas, Texas, all saw 5 percent cuts.\n\nStations like these have large donor bases or “listeners like you”, as their hosts say during pledge drives. Big market stations might be able to make up the difference, says Alex Curley, a former product manager at NPR who recently launched a platform called Adopt A Station, which shows which public media stations are at most risk of losing funding.\n\n“When you think about stations that rely on federal funding for 50 percent or more of their revenue, it’s not because they’re asking for a handout. It’s a literal public service for those stations,” Curley told Al Jazeera.\n\nBut in counties where the population is sparse and industry is limited, that donor base is not as plentiful. That’s the case with AMR.\n\n“We are in a very rural area. We are an area where there are not a whole lot of businesses. So that amount of income simply cannot be made up through extra donations or extra underwriting,” Smith added.\n\nIn a July Substack post, Curley, who was involved in NPR station finances until he left the network in 2024 amid layoffs, said that 15 percent of stations are at risk of closure. His website has provided some reprieve.\n\n“I only expected maybe a few dozen people to visit the site. My biggest hope was to get a couple of donations that went towards a station at risk. It’s [the website] been shared thousands of times. I’ve even heard from stations that were identified as being at risk of closing. They told me they’re getting an influx of donations from out of state through the site. It’s been an incredible response,” Curley said.\n\nHowever, he argues, this is a temporary fix.\n\n“The real danger will be in six months, a year, two years, when people have forgotten about public media. These stations basically are losing federal funding forever. Donations in the short term are really great, but in the long term, they’re going to have to figure out ways to keep donors engaged and to keep donations flowing to them, or they might close,” Curley added.\n\n“Public radio is also a lifeline, connecting rural communities to the rest of the nation, and providing life-saving emergency broadcasting and weather alerts. Nearly 3-in-4 Americans say they rely on their public radio stations for alerts and news for their public safety,” NPR’s Katherine Maher said in a statement on July 18 following the Senate vote.\n\n“In fact, while the Senate considered amendments, a 7.3 earthquake struck off the coast of Alaska, prompting three coastal stations to start broadcasting live tsunami warnings, urging their communities to head to high ground,” Maher said.\n\nMaher declined Al Jazeera’s request for an interview\n\nPBS faces similar pressures, and many of its stations are also at risk of closure, according to Adopt A Station’s data.\n\n“These cuts will significantly impact all of our stations, but will be especially devastating to smaller stations and those serving large rural areas. Many of our stations, which provide access to free, unique local programming and emergency alerts, will now be forced to make hard decisions in the weeks and months ahead,” PBS president and CEO Paula Kerger said in a statement after the Senate vote.\n\nKerger did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for additional comment.\n\nThe push to defund public media isn’t a new one for the GOP. Republicans have long argued that the media is not a core function of government. In 2012, GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney said he would eliminate subsidies to PBS – during a debate moderated, ironically, by then PBS NewsHour anchor Jim Lehrer.\n\nIn the 1990s, then House Speaker Newt Gingrich promised to “zero out” funding for CPB, arguing it should be privatised. And in the 1980s, Ronald Reagan attempted to slash $80m from public media – roughly $283m today – though Congress blocked the move.\n\nFollowing global cuts\n\nCuts to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting are the latest wave of the White House cutting back on government-funded media arms, including reductions to the US Agency for Global Media, led in part by senior adviser Kari Lake.\n\nLake is a former Phoenix, Arizona, news anchor known for denying the 2020 election results in which Trump lost to Democrat Joe Biden for the presidency. She is also known for promoting baseless conspiracy theories and for refusing to accept her own defeat for governor and senator bids in Arizona in 2022 and 2024, respectively.\n\nShe has been behind the agency effectively shuttering Voice of America (VOA), which has not published any new stories or uploaded new videos to its YouTube page since mid-March.\n\nLast month, a federal judge in Washington blocked the firing of workers at VOA, which affected more than 500 staffers. The Trump administration called the decision “outrageous” and vowed to appeal.\n\nRadio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, which broadcasts in 27 languages across 23 countries, faced challenges similar to VOA. However, the European Union has helped keep the network up and running with $6.2m in emergency funding.\n\nRepresentatives for the US Agency for Global Media did not respond to our request for comment.\n\nLooming threats to free expression\n\nThese cuts come alongside other threats to freedom of expression in the private sector. Soon after the funding cuts were signed into law, Paramount announced the cancellation of The Late Show. The host, comedian Stephen Colbert – a longtime critic of the president – had only days earlier called out Paramount, the show’s parent company, for settling a lawsuit with Trump.\n\nThe suit stemmed from Trump’s claim that an interview with his 2024 presidential rival Kamala Harris was doctored. Although the network had initially called the lawsuit meritless, it ultimately settled for $16m. Colbert called the settlement a “big fat bribe”, noting that Paramount had a then-pending merger with Skydance Media – owned by David Ellison, son of Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, a key Trump ally. The merger has since been approved. Paramount has said that the decision is purely financial in nature.\n\nMonths later, following stand-up comedian Jimmy Kimmel’s comments on Charlie Kirk’s death, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Brendan Carr appeared on a right-wing podcast to criticise the remarks and urged Disney – the parent company of ABC, where Jimmy Kimmel Live airs – to cancel the show.\n\nNexstar Media Group – one of the largest TV station operators in the US, and which is waiting on an FCC approval of its merger with Tegna – announced it would no longer carry the programme. Disney subsequently suspended the show, though the decision was short-lived, as it returned to the airwaves within a week.\n\nThe White House did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment.","summary":"Local stations like the Allegheny Mountain Radio serve as a key resource for locals during times of stress.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/10/20/as-public-media-funds-officially-dry-up-local-radio-stations-struggle?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Image-2-1760627869.jpeg?resize=1920%2C1364","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-20 15:50:36","author":"Andy Hirschfeld,Apps Support","authors":["Andy Hirschfeld","Apps Support"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.468},{"id":370970486,"title":"Bill Maher admits more 'perspective' on George W Bush during interview with cousin Billy, wants him on podcast","text":"HBO host Bill Maher told TV personality Billy Bush in an interview published Monday that he may have been too hard on his cousin, former President George W. Bush, during his time in office. During the latest episode of Maher’s \"Club Random\" podcast, the host said that although he doesn’t regret his criticism of the 43rd president, he has \"more perspective\" in the age of President Donald Trump and could have been less antagonistic toward him. \"But I also have things much more in perspective. He should know that yes, I probably, looking back, could have been more reasonable,\" Maher told Billy Bush. KAMALA HARRIS COMPLAINS ABOUT 'IMPOSSIBLE' LACK OF SUPPORT FROM BIDEN'S COMMS TEAM, INNER CIRCLE Maher asked Bush to pass along his message to the former Republican president after the show. \"First of all, I was very hard on him,\" he told his guest. Maher added, \"You know, I was hard. I'm not taking it back. I wasn't for the invasion of Iraq or, you know, I mean, just the basic Republican policies that he championed were not exactly my cup of tea.\" Billy Bush told Maher he should bust his \"a--\" to get former President Bush on the show, saying he was an \"easy hang\" and also quite funny. Maher said he would \"love to talk to\" him on the show if possible. George W. Bush, who served two terms from 2001 to 2009, was the last Republican president before Trump's ascension in 2016. Trump took over the Republican Party and was highly critical of the Bush era during his campaign. Among the Republicans that Trump vanquished in the 2016 primary fight was another of his guest's cousins, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. WHY JIMMY CARTER IS THE FATHER OF THE POST-PRESIDENCY, SAW THE POWER OF HIS STATUS The progressive comedian has continued to criticize the former president over the years. In a 2013 Vanity Fair column, Maher reflected on Bush’s presidency in a negative light. During a 2016 segment of HBO’s \"Real Time with Bill Maher,\" the host slammed Jeb Bush for inviting his brother to help him campaign for the nomination. After criticizing Bush’s Iraq invasion, Maher asked his panel, \"Shouldn’t George W. Bush be the least popular guy among the military? It’s like battered wife syndrome. Why do you like a guy who sent you to lose lives and limbs and be away from your family to a war we now agree was not necessary?\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE MEDIA AND CULTURE NEWS On his podcast, Maher told Bush’s cousin that he also felt the former president’s idea of privatizing Social Security \"wasn’t like the worst idea.\" He also praised President Bush for his graciousness toward former President Barack Obama when he won the presidency, contrasting the move with Trump’s sharp partisanship. \"I've also mentioned many times that, you know, to contrast him with where we are now, when Obama won, he was in office. [Bush] had him in there… He said, ‘We want you to succeed’ — which is something you can't imagine Donald Trump saying,\" Maher said. \"It was just a different era where we were Republicans, Democrats, liberals, conservatives, but it wasn't at this horrible place we are now,\" he added.

In June, his temper flared while addressing the Iran-Israel conflict. “We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don’t know what the [expletive language] they’re doing,” he snapped. \n\nBy September, Trump claimed at the UN that “everyone” thought he deserved a Nobel Peace Prize, yet boasted he was content knowing he’d saved “millions of children” by resolving seven international conflicts. Days later, he told U.S. service members that the Nobel would go to “a writer who wrote about my peacekeeping achievements before they gave it to me.”\n\nHe then went on to announce on Fox News that he had resolved tensions between Azerbaijan and Albania, two countries that had never actually fought. A video later showed the leaders of Albania, Azerbaijan, and France laughing about the blunder. Strangely, Trump didn’t lash out online, sparing them the fury he typically reserves for critics.\n\nAlbanian PM and President of Azerbaijan laugh about (at) Trump for claiming that he ended the war between their two countries (They were not at war with each other) pic.twitter.com/gTJM5Rc5y0\n— J. Carlos Fox, Esq🦊 (@JCarlosFox) October 3, 2025 \n\nIn another bizarre moment that month, Trump battled an unexpected enemy, an escalator. During his entrance at the United Nations, the machine abruptly stopped as he and Melania stepped on. Things got worse when his teleprompter and speakers failed. \n\nBREAKING: Trump got invited to speak at the United Nations… and used his time to rant about a broken escalator and a teleprompter.\nWorld leaders were expecting strategy.\nThey got stand-up comedy. pic.twitter.com/hkvSzBtOry\n— Brian Allen (@allenanalysis) September 23, 2025 \n\nThough the glitch silenced his remark that some nations were “going to hell” due to their “dreadful immigration policies,” it visibly rattled him. Later, on Truth Social, he turned the mishap into melodrama: “It’s amazing that Melania and I didn’t fall forward onto the sharp edges of these steel steps, face first. It was only that we were each holding the handrail tightly or, it would have been a disaster.” He wrapped up by assuring his followers that his stalled UN speech got “fantastic reviews.”\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nOne of 2025’s biggest fallouts came when Trump’s friendship with Elon Musk disintegrated publicly. The feud began after Musk criticized Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill.” The president retaliated in a June Social post, writing, “Elon was ‘wearing thin,’ I asked him to leave, I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted… and he just went CRAZY!” \n\nTrump later accused Musk of hypocrisy, reminding followers that his empire thrived on government subsidies. Then came the pettier side of the breakup, Trump joking about using DOGE to calculate how much public money could be saved by cutting subsidies. His tone suggested anger, but it was clear that he was quite hurt about the way his Musk’s relationship got strained.\n\nBy midyear, even small irritations became presidential crises. In March, after seeing a less-than-flattering portrait of himself at Colorado’s State Capitol, Trump fumed online that it was “purposefully distorted to a level that even I, perhaps, have never seen before.” \n\nHe even compared it unfavorably to Barack Obama’s, then mocked the artist with the line, “She must have lost her talent as she got older.” Governor Jared Polis wasn’t spared either. The portrait was eventually replaced with one of Trump’s official 2025 presidential images.\n\nAutumn brought more minor grievances. On Newsmax’s Greg Kelly Reports, Trump dismissed Super Bowl LX headliner Bad Bunny, saying, “I’ve never heard of” him and calling the choice “absolutely ridiculous.” The 79-year-old seemed baffled that Kid Rock wasn’t onstage instead.\n\nTrump also reignited political feuds. His dispute with Representative Thomas Massie echoed his earlier clashes. After Massie voted against the “Big Beautiful Bill,” Trump called him “a pathetic LOSER” and “a ‘lightweight’ Congressman,” writing that “MAGA is not about lazy, grandstanding, nonproductive politicians.” \n\nBut while he scorched Massie, his approach to California’s Governor Gavin Newsom was surprisingly restrained. Newsom mocked Trump online, adopting his signature all-caps style and ridiculing his team, yet Trump’s only response was a lukewarm post: “Gavin Newscum is way down in the polls. He is viewed as the man who is destroying the once Great State of California. I will save California.” \n\nHis simmering anger found other outlets — this time in the courts. In March, after Judge James Boasberg halted his plan to deport Venezuelan migrants using the Alien Enemies Act, Trump exploded on Truth Social. \n\nHe ranted, “He didn’t WIN the popular VOTE (by a lot!)… HE DIDN’T WIN ANYTHING! I WON FOR MANY REASONS… BUT FIGHTING ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION MAY HAVE BEEN THE NUMBER ONE REASON FOR THIS HISTORIC VICTORY.” He branded Boasberg a “Radical Left Lunatic” and urged impeachment. Trump even shared a photo of the judge with Kamala Harris’ husband as supposed proof of bias.\n\nBy October, he turned his wrath toward New York Attorney General Letitia James, calling her “‘SCUM’” and “corrupt,” and accusing her of billion-dollar damages to his business empire. “WITCH HUNT,” he thundered, dragging up her failed gubernatorial run to taunt her further.\n\nThese are some of the key moments of meltdown that the President had till now. With a couple of more months left for 2025 to end, it now remains to be seen if Trump has any other massive meltdown that would top the ones already listed.","summary":"Trump's 2025 meltdowns reveal chaos behind peacekeeper claims.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/weird-public-meltdowns-of-peace-president-donald-trump-history-wont-forget","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Trump-keeps-having-meltdowns.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-20 13:38:47","author":"Pramila Tripathi","authors":["Pramila Tripathi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.516},{"id":370941952,"title":"Nation’s nuclear weapon watchdog gutted to just 400 workers from nearly 2,000 as Trump shutdown layoffs hit agency","text":"The federal agency tasked with safeguarding the nation’s nuclear stockpile will see the vast majority of its staff furloughed Monday as the government shutdown continues to affect funding, the Department of Energy said.\n\nThe National Nuclear Security Administration, which employs roughly 1,800 workers, will furlough about 1,400 people – leaving 375 staffers on the job, an Energy Department spokesperson told CNN. \n\nThe agency, which ensures the U.S. maintains a safe and reliable nuclear stockpile as well as modernizes nuclear weaponry, has never furloughed employees during any previous government shutdown.\n\n“We are left with no choice this time,” Ben Dietderich, a spokesperson for the Energy Department, said. “We’ve extended funding as long as we could.”\n\nThe Independent has asked the Department of Energy for comment.\n\nThe department said the agency’s Office of Secure Transportation, which is responsible for safely moving nuclear materials, would run out of funding October 27.\n\nSecretary of Energy Chris Wright is expected to speak about the government shutdown’s impact on workforce retention while visiting the Nevada National Security Site Monday. \n\nMembers of Congress were informed of the agency’s furloughs last week.

She loves designer handbags and luxurious accommodations, and she has maintained firm boundaries with the media. She’s known to be somewhat opposite of President Trump; she loves home-cooked food, is much fitter, and prefers to keep her personal life away from the spotlight, unlike POTUS, who loves to be the center of attention.\n\nHowever, as they say, everyone has some drawbacks; Melania is known for her notable feud with former First Ladies and her stepdaughters. For instance, it’s no secret that the current and former First Ladies aren’t the best of friends.\n\nBack in 2022, an insider told OK! Magazine that Jill Biden believed Melania had “awful taste,” and later that year, Jill appeared to take a subtle jab at Melania with a not-so-coincidental fashion choice. Tensions escalated dramatically in 2022 after the FBI raided Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in search of classified documents.\n\n“Good for Melania”\nMelania gracefully declines invitation to Jill’s traditional White House meeting.\nMelania response is a healthy response.

In a September 2024 interview on Fox & Friends, Melania broke her silence.\n\n“It made me angry. Yes. Invasion of privacy,” she told host Ainsley Earhardt. “You get angry because, you know, nobody should be putting up with that kind of stuff.” Consequently, Melania Trump addressed Jill Biden directly during an interview with Paris Match.\n\nWhile she acknowledged receiving a phone call from Jill after the assassination attempt on Donald Trump, she questioned the sincerity of the gesture. “I do question, however, whether Jill’s concern was genuine, as a few days prior she referred to my husband as ‘evil’ and a ‘liar,'” she added.\n\nIn November 2024, Melania Trump reportedly refused Jill Biden’s traditional First Lady tea invitation at the White House, a gesture meant to welcome new First Ladies. According to The Daily Mail, this was the second time Melania skipped the tradition. She also did not invite Jill in 2021.\n\nMelania Trump takes swipe at Jill Biden’s call after assassination attempt: I question whether her concern was genuine https://t.co/oY2M8ArHs6 pic.twitter.com/3oFehcyaTc\n— New York Post (@nypost) November 13, 2024\n\nYet, Jill Biden maintained a cordial tone with Melania and encouraged the importance of preserving White House traditions and civility. “Joe and I respect our institutions, our traditions, and it’s very important to me that they continue,” she explained. “What would be the point of nastiness?”\n\nPresident Donald Trump has also said many negative things about Joe Biden and his administration previously. He claimed that under Biden and Kamala Harris’ leadership, America lost its golden age, and the system was broken, and that Trump would fix it. He also mocked Joe Biden on several instances over his body, health and so on.\n\nIvanka Trump has also reportedly feuded with her stepmother, Melania Trump. This feud reportedly began when Donald Trump assumed office in 2016. The two worked together as Ivanka and her husband, Jared, were involved in Trump’s administration.

McGrath, however, told Salon that any suggestion that she was running for the money was “total bullshit” — while adding that she would drop out if her state’s popular Democratic governor, Andy Beshear, decides to enter the race himself.\n\nIn 2020, McGrath generated hype among national Democrats with a biography that many thought could be appealing in a conservative state. But despite record-breaking fundraising, McGrath went on to lose by more than 20 points to Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., her campaign becoming the prime example for critics who say Democrats have too often fallen prey to expensive but futile campaigns and fundraising tactics that are unsustainable.\n\nMcGrath’s announcement garnered pushback from some elected Democrats, like Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., who said, “Amy has previously run for this seat [and] only succeeded in enriching consultants [and] bleeding well-meaning donors dry, one text at a time.”\n\nFormer Rep. Susan Wild, D-Pa., also responded to the announcement, saying, “please don’t.” Multiple Kentucky papers likewise published opinions expressing skepticism over McGrath’s second Senate campaign.\n\nIn an interview with Salon, McGrath addressed the controversy over her campaign announcement, saying, “We’re all fighting for the same goals: to protect people’s health care, to make lives better for people, to lower costs.”\n\n“We are also all fighting for a Democratic majority that delivers for Americans,” McGrath said, “and in this moment, we’re all fighting to protect our democracy, and I’ve always had deep respect for anyone doing this work. I think you know we need to stay focused on the real fight here, and not each other.”\n\nMcGrath defended running again despite losing to McConnell in 2020, arguing that the loss — her second in as many years — shouldn’t preclude her from trying again.\n\n“Ask Bernie Sanders how many times he ran,” McGrath said.\n\nAt the same time, McGrath said she would be willing to step aside. “Of course, I would support Andy Beshear” in the event he announced a bid for Senate, she said. “He’s been an incredible governor.”\n\nMcGrath, when asked why she chose to run for Senate again, rather than Kentucky’s 6th House District, which she almost won in 2018, said that she no longer lives in the district, which encompasses Lexington and the surrounding area, and that she believes voters there are entitled to a representative who lives in the district.\n\nHer strategy this time, she said, is to focus more on state-level concerns than on what’s happening in Washington, DC.\n\n“You don’t focus on yourself. You don’t focus on what national politicians are talking about,” McGrath said, explaining that she believes healthcare will be central in the 2026 race after Republicans cut nearly $1 trillion in health care funding. “You focus on the cost of groceries. You focus on keeping hospitals open. You focus on showing up.”\n\nShe also alluded to the “chaos” brought on by Trump’s policies, like the ongoing government shutdown.\n\n“This chaos that you’re seeing from Trump hurts Kentucky families,” McGrath said. “It hurts them. Tariffs raise the prices, shutdowns threaten our military pay, attacks on our democracy, [dividing] our neighbors.”\n\nMcGrath also said that Trump would loom large over the midterms.\n\n“I have been strong on Donald Trump and been honest about him. Now, what? What do I say to Kentuckians, you know, who voted for him? Look, he promised a lot of stuff. He promised he wasn’t going to go after Medicare and Medicaid. And what is, what is he doing? He did just that, you know, what about these tariffs? People didn’t vote for Donald Trump for these tariffs. I mean, they didn’t vote for higher prices,” McGrath said.\n\nWhen asked what she had learned from the governor’s success in the state, McGrath said that “the best campaigns are built on listening and Andy Beshear is really good at that.” Beshear has won two statewide elections in Kentucky, first in 2019, when he won the gubernatorial race by less than a point, and again in 2023, when he won by five points.\n\nMcGrath also addressed some criticisms stemming from the immense sum of money raised for her campaign and the Democratic fundraising and consultant complex more generally. She said it was “total bullshit” to suggest that “consultants somehow got rich off of my campaign.”\n\n“No one got rich off my campaign,” she said.\n\nStart your day with essential news from Salon.\nSign up for our free morning newsletter, Crash Course.\n\nMcGrath also touted the “largest field operation in Kentucky history” and said that after her campaign had ended, “we used our operation, what was left of the operation, to raise money and help out for the two Georgia Senate candidates who were left.”\n\nMcGrath was referring to the PAC she founded after her loss in 2020, Democratic Majority Action, which, despite being created after the general election, raised $874,000 in the 2020 cycle and is still active today. In total, the two Senate races in Georgia in 2020 saw $507 million in ad spending, according to the ad spending tracking firm AdImpact.\n\nThe amount of money raised by DMA or transferred to the Kentucky state party by the McGrath campaign does, however, pale in comparison to the amount of money spent on advertising by the main PAC supporting her candidacy, Honor Bound PAC. According to FEC filings, the McGrath campaign spent just shy of $59 million on advertising that cycle.\n\nSome agencies received millions of dollars for advertising, like Buying Time, a DC-based ad firm that managed more than $5 million in ad buys in just one week in October, and Do Big Things, an Illinois-based political consultancy firm that managed a single $2 million buy around the same.\n\nMcGrath’s campaign manager, Mark Nickolas, also received a salary of about $175,000 a year during the time he was working on the campaign, as well as a lump sum payment of nearly $368,000 on November 9, 2020, about a week after the election.\n\nWhile the totals disclosed in FEC filings represent the total sum spent on advertising, including production costs and the price of airtime, ad agencies typically are paid a percentage of the total spend on advertising, meaning the more a campaign spends, the more advertising consultants make.\n\nThough the issue is not specific to McGrath’s campaign, many Democrats have become increasingly critical of the advertising-centric campaign spending, particularly in the wake of former Vice President Kamala Harris’s failed 2024 bid, which raised a record $1 billion.","summary":"McGrath tells Salon \"no one got rich\" off her last Senate campaign, but that she could step aside for someone else","url":"https://www.salon.com/2025/10/20/amy-mcgrath-isnt-sorry-for-trying-again/","image":"https://www.salon.com/app/uploads/2025/10/amy-mcgrath-1229310449-150x150.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-20 10:30:52","author":"Russell Payne","authors":["Russell Payne"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.005},{"id":370884888,"title":"Bari Weiss reportedly 'stunned' '60 Minutes' crew by asking why the country thinks they're 'biased': report","text":"CBS News editor-in-chief Bari Weiss allegedly \"stunned\" the staff behind CBS’ \"60 Minutes\" by asking them why they believed people considered them biased, a new report claimed Sunday.

The New Jersey endorsement, in particular, has added another layer to that foray back into politics. Not only is Obama getting involved, but so is President Donald Trump, making the contest a proxy battle that will test the enduring sway of a current and former president.\n\nSome strategists are skeptical that Obama’s endorsement will make-or-break Sherrill’s turnout when New Jersey voters head to the polls on Nov. 4.\n\nHenry de Koninck, a New Jersey strategist and political consultant, told the Washington Examiner he thinks the endorsement will help marginally in areas such as Newark, Trenton, and Camden — areas Sherrill needs to win.\n\n“From a persuasion perspective, it’s not a game-changer in terms of folks who were on the fence one way or another,” he said. “I don’t expect that to move numbers meaningfully.”\n\nThe race nonetheless comes at a time when Democrats are losing their hold on a coalition that propelled Obama to two terms in the White House. Trump, aided by a sizable shift in minority support, only lost New Jersey to former Vice President Kamala Harris by 6 points, while Ciattarelli came relatively close the last time he ran for governor.\n\nOther experts, like veteran New York-based strategist Hank Sheinkopf, say Obama could be helpful in bringing African American voters and independents to Sherrill’s side.\n\n“He’s a popular ex-president,” Sheinkopf said.\n\nObama retakes the spotlight\n\nObama’s foray into New Jersey, a state he won by 14 points in 2008 and 17 points in 2012, comes as part of a larger focus on races up and down the ballot.\n\nObama endorsed Sherrill on Friday morning, and he is appearing in digital ads for both her and Rep. Abigail Spanberger (D-VA), whom he also endorsed in her gubernatorial race against GOP Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears in Virginia. In the ad for Sherrill, her background as a mother, veteran, and federal prosecutor is highlighted — three areas that have served as the focal point for her campaign.\n\nThe former president has also gotten involved in the redistricting battle in California, where Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) is asking voters to allow maps to be redrawn to counter Texas’s efforts to protect Republicans’ margins in the House.\n\nSeparately, Obama has been accepting more interviews, whether it’s with seasoned journalists or popular influencers.\n\nIn one podcast appearance, Obama praised up-and-coming young candidates such as James Talarico, who is running for the Democratic nomination in Texas for the Senate seat held by Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX). He hasn’t endorsed Talarico, but said he possesses the qualities that Democrats should be looking for heading into a critical midterm year.\n\nMore broadly, he’s been criticizing Trump for his restrictions on the press at the White House and his deployment of the National Guard. He’s also warned his party to abandon its “holier-than-thou” messaging style.\n\n“You can’t constantly lecture people without acknowledging that you’ve got some blind spots, too, and that life’s messy,” Obama said during an interview with comedian Marc Maron.\n\nThe former president’s support comes after Democrats faced critical setbacks in the 2024 election, losing the White House and the Senate. Though Harris won New Jersey, Trump made significant inroads in a state he lost in 2020 to former President Joe Biden by nearly 16 points.\n\nDemocrats have struggled with intraparty conflicts about how combative they should be with the new administration, as younger activists have enthusiastically demanded changing the old guard and bringing fresh blood to Capitol Hill.\n\nWith early voting underway in New Jersey, Democrats are hoping Obama’s endorsement will nudge voters who have either trended toward Trump or remain on the fence about the candidates to turn out for Sherrill.\n\nNew Jersey race becomes proxy battle\n\nOn the other side, Trump threw his support behind Ciattarelli in May. As the election proves to be competitive, he is amping up his endorsement by holding tele-rallies for the Republican. Trump’s allies also plan to throw millions into a pro-Ciattarelli super PAC. \n\nSheinkopf, the political strategist, said that he thinks Trump’s endorsement of Ciattarelli will be significant, particularly among Jewish voters following the ceasefire deal the administration helped negotiate between Hamas and Israel. \n\nHe predicted the ceasefire, which saw Hamas release the final living Israeli hostages this past week, would boost Ciattarelli in places such as Lakewood Township and Bergen County, the latter of which has one of the largest Jewish populations in New Jersey. \n\nSheinkopf said the Democratic Party is “questionable” on the conflict, which could benefit Ciattarelli.\n\nDe Konick thinks Trump’s endorsement and last-minute support of Ciattarelli could have the opposite effect. Sherrill has spent much of her campaign tying her Republican opponent to Trump and his Make America Great Again base, hoping that poor public opinion of the president’s agenda will drag Ciattarelli down. \n\nThe increased support from the president and his allies could turn off independents or persuadable Democrats who want to see daylight between a New Jersey Republican governor and the Trump administration.\n\nDe Koninck said he thinks the absence of Trump on the ballot will also be helpful to Sherrill.\n\n“Trump is someone who motivates Democrats very much to come out and vote against him and against people who he’s endorsed,” the strategist said. “He is motivating to Republicans and his supporters to come out and vote for him, but he has not demonstrated the ability to translate that to other candidates.” \n\n“So Trump could be a turnout factor in the election, but not in the way that Republicans are open to seeing,” he added.\n\nMudslinging helps create a tight race\n\nSherrill holds a narrow lead over Ciattarelli, but polling ahead of the election shows it could be anyone’s to win. \n\nA Fox News survey released Friday found Sherrill ahead of Ciattarelli by 5 points, down from an 8-point lead in late September. Sherrill’s RealClearPolitics average lead is 4 points after the Fox News poll came out, down slightly from the 4.6-point lead she had prior to its release.\n\nThe polling comes as campaign attacks from both sides take their toll on the candidates’ favorability and honesty ratings. Sherrill is viewed as more honest than not, 52% to 47%, while Ciattarelli’s honesty rating is underwater by 2 points.\n\nBoth candidates were scrutinized when Sherrill’s military records were released in full to a Ciattarelli ally, including her Social Security number. The release came after the New Jersey Globe reported on a 1994 cheating scandal at the Naval Academy, where Sherrill attended. She is not accused of cheating, but said she was not allowed to walk at graduation because she failed to report her classmates involved in the scandal — a fact that Republicans have latched on to.\n\nCiattarelli is facing a controversy of his own for a former medical publishing company that he owned. During the October debate, Sherrill claimed the company’s “propaganda” and “misinformation” contributed to thousands of opioid-related deaths and that Ciattarelli “profited” from those deaths.\n\nThe Republican has initiated a defamation lawsuit against Sherrill for her comments, saying she “crossed a line and sunk to dangerous levels of unhinged rhetoric.” Sherrill’s campaign has called the lawsuit “desperate.” \n\nWhen it comes to mudslinging, Sheinkopf thinks Ciattarelli has the advantage, as the ads attacking Ciattarelli “don’t have the same bite” as the ads attacking Sherrill, some of which question her commitment to lowering energy costs.\n\n“They’re much more kind of visceral,” Sheinkopf said of the anti-Sherrill ads. “The same way the electric utility costs are visceral. This is a more visceral kind of campaign, and the question is, who has a greater emotional bite?”\n\nGovernor’s race swayed by national politics\n\nThe government shutdown in Washington, D.C., seeped into the election after the White House paused funding for the Hudson Tunnel project to connect New Jersey and New York via a tunnel under the Hudson River.\n\nCiattarelli has aligned mostly with Trump’s agenda and national Republicans’ messaging on the shutdown, stating the frozen project funding is due to Sherrill’s “no” vote on the GOP’s short-term bill to fund the government. Sherrill, in turn, framed the situation as one in which Ciattarelli would never stand up to the Trump administration.\n\n“He will choose Trump over New Jersey every time,” Sherrill said earlier this month.\n\nThe New York City mayoral race has also crept into the race. While Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani has said he supports Sherrill’s bid for governor, she has declined to endorse Mamdani. \n\n“Democrats are not performing well because they don’t have a consistent message,” Sheinkopf said. “And the problem for her is that she is also carrying the weight of the national Democratic Party that is in tatters.”\n\nThe candidacy and nomination of Mamdani, a self-proclaimed socialist, have been a thorn in the side of establishment Democrats hoping to turn away from progressive politics and go back to kitchen-table issues. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) has yet to endorse Mamdani, telling reporters Friday he will talk with the nominee “at some point” before early voting begins.\n\nMamdani’s race puts Sherrill and other Democrats in a tough place, Sheinkopf said.\n\n“Democrats are being taken over by the Left, and that positioning, particularly with Mamdani in New York, makes it more difficult for Democrats to win,” the strategist said. “Every time Mamdani opens his mouth, he elects another Republican.”\n\nIT’S GROUNDHOG DAY ON CAPITOL HILL WITH NO SHUTDOWN SOLUTION IN SIGHT\n\nStill, Sheinkopf said the election is wide open for both candidates, and the victor will be the one who successfully appeals to local issues the voters care about, such as high energy costs.\n\n“The polling data is pretty instructive,” Sheinkopf said. “It’s not a walk away by any measure.… It tells you that people are concerned about bread and butter issues, so the less you talk national arguments, the better. The more you talk about localized issues, the higher the probability that you will connect with the voters.”","summary":"Former President Barack Obama is making the New Jersey governor’s race a fresh test of his electoral influence as Democrats seek to keep Republicans from gaining a foothold in a traditionally blue state.

Mason lays out the gendered minefield of the modern office, in which women are unfairly labelled ice queens or doormats: those who give direction are penalized for unseemly ambition, while those who radiate agreeableness sacrifice their authority. She cites the cases of two of her clients: Sara, who was scolded for writing e-mails that were too “brusque and officious,” and Sarah, who preferred to add value “behind the scenes,” lest she be seen as habitually “calling out” her accomplishments. What is needed, Mason writes, is “a broader array of communicative patterns,” and a strategy for unfurling women’s “true selves or capabilities.” By “reorienting our focus away from how we’re being perceived and instead working on who we are,” she continues, “we can amplify what is special about ourselves” and “show up as an individual rather than as the boring stereotypes from behind doors one or two.”\nMason, although she may quaintly underestimate the ways that a woman can be disliked in the office, is responding to a proven paradox of gender and leadership. When female employees prioritize performance over the comfort of others, their careers suffer, but when they concentrate on kindness they’re dismissed for a lack of decisiveness or vision. In 2024, a team of researchers led by the psychologist Vanessa Burke found that women who express pride at work are perceived as chillier than men who do the same. Meanwhile, the scientist Andrea C. Vial has shown that stereotypically feminine traits like communality and empathy are seen as “nice add-ons for leaders”—cute but expendable. Mason promises to equip women with the kind of charisma you are unlikely to exude while, say, reading a self-help text called “Powerfully Likeable” in the corporate cafeteria. A former world champion in debate, she writes that in striving to be “stern, adversarial, and hyperaggressive . . . I had won the tournament but had lost something of myself.” The book scans as a form of redress—an attempt to reconcile not only the demands of the workplace with the true self but also the apparent contradiction between competitiveness and care.\nSome of Mason’s guidance relates to projecting authority. She cautions that explanations should be “topline” and “architectural,” because “giving too much context is an immediate signal of non-seniority.” She urges women to assemble speaking styles out of a mix of masculine and feminine buzzwords, and to aspire toward “driven warmth” or “rational compassion.” (In a Hannah Horvath-esque gesture, the book endorses inwardly defining oneself as an expert, but not the expert.) Yet much of Mason’s advice is simply about being useful, by delivering facts and opinions in a clear, elegant way. Often, I found myself nodding along with her tips: be concise, don’t overprepare, dole out information in the right order. Although “Powerfully Likeable” purports to offer women tools for self-expression, its real subject frequently seems to be how to stop obsessing over your professional identity and tell people what they need to know.\nBut this workaday agenda has been artfully wrapped in therapy-speak. Mason’s project, she writes, was devised to relieve her own feeling of inauthenticity, and she has a menu of diagnoses for professional women who may experience the same dissonance. In her hands, the old chestnut of “impostor syndrome,” in which women fear that they will be exposed as frauds, becomes “imposing syndrome,” a private reluctance to take up space. Sections on “communicative self-care” and “presence dysmorphia” recommend mood-boosting exercises such as viewing yourself through the eyes of your best friend. The book claims that women can resist being typecast by appearing “authentically” as the “most powerful and likeable versions” of themselves; this thesis seems, in a bit of subtle customer service, to conflate the real you with the most successful and effective you.\nFix yourself by becoming more yourself: it’s not a new idea, even if it’s been newly grafted onto the org chart. For decades, advertisers have tried to inculcate in women an urgent sense of lack, while simultaneously insisting that their true selves—the selves that they can access by purchasing the right products—are perfect and complete. If Mason is unravelling a double bind here, it’s less about the tension between power and likability and more about a commercial quandary: how do you inflame the consumer’s desires while also appealing to her ego? “Powerfully Likeable” brings the marketplace into the workplace, which it reimagines as a venue where women can model their branded communication styles. The pitch is not that labor standards are dismally low but, rather, that workplaces would be fairer if they understood what makes us quintessentially us.\nIn certain circles, the book was canonized. It spent more than a year on the Times best-seller list and prompted the formation of hundreds of “Lean In” study groups, where women could practice “peer mentorship” and encourage one another to ask for raises. Sandberg’s critics, meanwhile, pointed out that her vision was limited in predictable and maddening ways: she was a stratospherically successful Harvard graduate who’d been mentored by Larry Summers, and who seemed ignorant of the challenges facing nonwhite and lower-income women. (Soon after “Lean In” was published, Sandberg became one of the youngest female billionaires in the world.) For a hymn to the transformative power of feminine ambition, the critique went, “Lean In” was oddly unambitious, its humble aims captured in the motion named by the title: here was an attempt not to revolutionize the workplace but to adjust the working woman’s angle of approach.\nIn retrospect, the book feels like an artifact of a fleetingly optimistic moment, and of a time when the mainstreaming of feminism—recall Beyoncé performing in front of a screen flashing the word “FEMINIST” at the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards—not only diluted the concept but also pressed it into service on behalf of the free market. As Susan Faludi observed, in 2013, “Lean In” belongs to a tradition going back to at least 1920, when mass merchandisers co-opted the idioms of emancipation in a bid for women’s money. Sandberg, who described her book as only “sort of a feminist manifesto,” refreshed the old aspirational consumerism by transferring it to work. It wasn’t so much that she promoted material accumulation, though she did, but that her financial resources, which enabled her “to afford any help I need,” were a silent precondition for much of her advice. (Note the ticklishness of her allusion to the costs of child care: a wary elision of offspring is a trademark of pop-feminist self-help.) The program she espoused for less privileged women was one of emulation—a kind of “fake it till you make it” regime in which everyone behaves as if she were Sheryl Sandberg. It was a canny move of self-branding—relatability braced by an element of seduction, by jokes and encouragement delivered in Sandberg’s warm, vulnerable, and confiding voice.\nBut if “Lean In” ’s prescriptions rang hollow even at the time, both Sandberg and the women’s movement ended up having bigger problems. Sandberg’s company, we learned, was damaging the mental health of teen-age girls, insufficiently safeguarding users’ personal information, and, arguably, destroying democracy. (As the Georgetown Law professor Rosa Brooks told the Times, “Not everything should be leaned into.”) Sandberg stepped down from Facebook in 2022, amid headlines underscoring her “mixed legacy.” Feminism, meanwhile, saw Hillary Clinton’s defeat, in 2016, by a man accused of sexual assault; the repeal of Roe v. Wade; the #MeToo backlash; and Kamala Harris’s loss, in 2024, to the same man. Although Sandberg’s key ideas now seem dated, her approach to self-commodification is everywhere. We’ve taken a scorched-earth approach to workplace feminism: burning away the last vestiges of institutional support and structure until only the brand remains.\nBrown and O’Neill devote a chapter to managing the public narrative of a job loss: strive to leave with poise and dignity; craft an “I got laid off” announcement; solicit introductions and take as many meetings as possible to furnish “proof of life.” Another chapter recommends being direct when explaining your departure: “Keep it high and tight. Nobody needs War and Peace.” In Brown and O’Neill’s construction, the savvy, freshly unemployed woman is a memoirist, as adept at omission as she is at the arrangement of detail. And, like a memoirist, she’s often trying to expunge shame, a word that appears thirty-one times in the book. “The truth is not shameful,” they write. “It’s freeing! There’s real power in being able to say, ‘Yeah, I got fired.’ When you own it, you strip away the stigma.”\nBrown and O’Neill cast themselves less as Sandberg’s heirs than as her apostates. “Over here, you see, we’re a little more lean out,” they write. They entreat readers to “have an identity outside of your job, be it on social media, a sports team, or at the local pottery workshop,” but the first item on that list gives away the game. Much of the book revolves around the art of telling your story online. There are injunctions to “maintain a consistent presence across all the platforms you appear on,” and caveats that internet screeds “are just one screengrab away from immortality.” The Cool Girls’ aims are lofty: they don’t merely seek to protect your material well-being; they wish to help you find your vocational purpose, to think through “how you’ve grown” and “what you represent.”\nAt times, “All the Cool Girls” replicates some of “Lean In” ’s more frustrating blind spots. (The authors suggest that one might save money while prioritizing the mental-health benefits of exercise by asking one’s personal trainer for a discount.) Like Sandberg, Brown and O’Neill use charm, humor, and tactful disclosure to fashion a relatable but lightly untouchable persona—they are influencers, not organizers, their vision of collectivism a faux sisterhood of similarly branded selves. Rather than departing from “Lean In,” the book updates Sandberg’s themes. Women are now supposed to lean into their reputations rather than their work projects. They’re exhorted to fine-tune their self-presentation to the public rather than to their supervisor. Whereas the 2013-era girlboss reshaped herself to accommodate her company, her present-day incarnation turns herself into a company, a twenty-four-hour amalgamation of C.E.O. and product. Once, she derived satisfaction from owning her labor; now she is celebrated for owning her story.\nAs Brown and O’Neill attempt to reimagine job loss—to make poinsettias out of pink slips—their positivity can seem to border on delusion. Good riddance, they call to crumbling labor norms, applying a varnish of empowerment to a program that looks like retreat. Sandberg, for all her interest in proto-influencing, focussed on being liked and respected in the boardroom. The Cool Girls are even more transactional, instructing women to monetize their connections on social media. This ideological evolution from “Love Me” to “Buy Me” maps onto a culture that increasingly instrumentalizes its workers, urging them to share, in lieu of the fruits of a joint struggle, a fluency in marketing copy. “Embrace your skills, your equity, and your worth,” Brown and O’Neill whoop. When you’re a Cool Girl, you may be your own most valuable asset, but only because the rest of your portfolio is empty.\nIn “Fly! A Woman’s Guide to Financial Freedom and Building a Life You Love,” Steph Wagner implores female readers to “recognize the critical importance of financial independence” and notes that nearly fifty per cent of women between the ages of fifty-five and sixty-six have no retirement savings. Wagner is the national director of women and wealth at a blue-chip assets-management company, and her investments in the subject are personal. After pulling a six-figure salary as a vice-president of a private-equity firm, she quit her job in order to become the C.M.O. (“Chief Mommy Officer”) to her three sons. Then her husband, Richard (a pseudonym), an executive at a mutual-fund company, cheated on her and announced that he was decamping to live on a ranch. Wagner recouped her losses by starting a financial-advising business oriented toward women.\nAcross forty pages of perfect derangement, Wagner uses her personal-finance handbook to unspool her divorce odyssey, seizing the ethos that no personal tragedy is too intimate to exploit. Seemingly every person she meets has an encouraging aphorism to share. When she arrives at a hotel restaurant, only to find it closed, two female employees prepare a feast, replete with bottles of red wine, waving away her request for the bill. “It’s just what we as women do for each other,” one of them says. Her son speaks to her in a “small but resolute” voice. “Mom,” he says, “I get it. You’re like the giving tree.”\nWagner is giving plenty—horoscope columnist, for one. After the personal-history section, readers are invited to determine their “money personality.” There’s the Giver (“her desire to help others can come at a cost”) and the Trailblazer (“with a clear vision and unwavering ambition, the Trailblazer exudes confidence and embraces thoughtful risk”), as well as the Skeptic, the High Roller, the Penny Pincher, and the Avoider. These dramatis personae, although they fall away soon after they’re introduced, suggest that the field of finance is not immune to influencer brain, which sorts people into targetable types, adds some prosperity gospel, pours a sense of mysticism or destiny on top, and presents the result as a panacea.\nIt’s probably no accident that, for Wagner, the only acceptable personality appears to be Trailblazer, perhaps with a side of High Roller. “Fly,” which portrays the self as a stock to be invested in, grown, and used to generate wealth, is a guide not for laborers but for capitalists. The feminist self-help industry, professing to foreground meaning and purpose, has instead become a mirror in which our financialized society admires its reflection. The irony of this capture is that imperatives such as “bring your whole self to work” are now issued by people who seem to have no idea what a whole self is. In their world, which is also ours, selfhood has degraded into taste, preferences, demography, and outlays of attention and money. It is interpreted by market researchers with the help of algorithms and large language models; it has little to do with our inner lives, imaginations, or souls. According to the spokespeople of grind culture, the choice is clear: your individuality can make money for you or it can make money for somebody else. Buying in is easier than it should be—falling so far through the looking glass that owning yourself starts to seem like the last frontier of freedom. ♦","summary":"A decade ago, Sheryl Sandberg’s “Lean In” aimed to tear down the obstacles that kept women from reaching the top.

MAGA supporters can blast anyone who takes offense to the posts as lacking a sense of humor and being prim. The posts also trivialize protesters’ gravely serious claims that America is witnessing a wannabe autocrat. But they also subtly advance the thesis that Trump is all-powerful and immune from dissent, an attractive proposition to voters who like a strongman.\nAttendees sign a banner representing the US Constitution during a \"No Kings\" protest in Washington, DC, on Saturday.\nAllison Robbert/AP\nTrump’s post is not only juvenile but also betrays striking contempt for tens of millions of Americans he ostensibly leads and for the concept of democratic free speech. He’s far from the first major political figure to express disdain for voters they don’t agree with. Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, as well as 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, all had their moments. And a sense that liberal elites disrespected heartland Americans was fundamental to Trump’s rise to power.\nMoreover, Democrats seem to have done little self-reflection over whether their aggressive push to implement their progressive values alienated more conservative Americans and contributed to their own defeat in 2024.\nBut the president’s social media baiting would be easier to laugh off if it weren’t for multiplying actions that reinforce his pretensions to absolute power and the obliteration of constitutional curbs meant to ensure kings don’t again rule America. He’s implying there’s no room for those who don’t support him and showing he’s willing to force them into line.\nWhether such leadership is forcing the country inexorably closer to a political and social fracture or a pride-induced fall by Trump and his gang will become clear in the months to come. The stakes are especially high amid a government shutdown the president appears to have no desire to end.\nBut as Trump’s behavior becomes more imperious and as opposition gathers — from street protests to more universities refusing to bend to his ideological will, and judges temporarily halting his orders for troops to enter US cities — tensions and divisions are rising.\nThe president shows no sign of changing course. He called Saturday’s mass protests a “joke” and described them as “very small, very ineffective.” The people who took part were “whacked out,” Trump said.\n“When you look at those people, those are not representative of the people of our country,” he told reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday.\nTrump’s latest monarchical moves\nTrump’s recent track record reinforces perceptions that his denial that he sees himself as a king is yet another of his uncountable untruths.\nHis stunning commutation Friday night of the seven-year sentence of former Rep. George Santos, who pleaded guilty to fraud charges, was the president’s latest parody of the legal system that he unapologetically wields as a tool to help his friends and hurt his foes. This followed his demands that ex-FBI chief James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James be charged with crimes, which were followed by indictments scant weeks later.\nSantos on Sunday related to CNN’s Dana Bash how he’d been alerted to his impending release by other prison inmates who heard about it on TV. On “State of the Union,” Santos said, “I’m pretty confident that if President Trump had pardoned Jesus Christ off of the cross, he would have had critics. So that’s just the reality of our country.” But Rep. Nick LaLota, Santos’ former GOP colleague from New York, said of Santos: “He stole millions, defrauded an election, and his crimes (for which he pled guilty) warrant more than a three-month sentence.”\nRep. George Santos is surrounded by journalists as he leaves the US Capitol after his fellow members of Congress voted to expel him from the House of Representatives on December 1, 2023.\nKevin Dietsch/Getty Images\nPardoning and commutations are one of the few areas where the Constitution suggest presidents do have unaccountable power. But Trump’s treatment of Santos, which was far from his first highly political show of clemency, was an audacious statement that the US legal system’s reputation for blind justice now risks being tainted by made-to-order prosecutions and his regal whims. (Of course, Republicans will respond that Biden pardoned members of his own family, so all is fair game.)\nThe president’s authoritarian writ is also being extended abroad.\n► Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced Sunday that the US military conducted a seventh strike against a boat in the Caribbean that the administration claims was manned by narcotics traffickers. “These cartels are the Al Qaeda of the Western Hemisphere, using violence, murder and terrorism to impose their will, threaten our national security and poison our people,” Hegseth said.\n► Trump’s promises to get tough with drugs traffickers who have caused great misery inside the US resonated with many voters last year. But the administration’s unilateral designation of traffickers as terrorists and assumption of authority to kill them without due process, while ignoring Congress’ authority over war powers, is arguably illegal and unconstitutional. It places the United States in a category of nations that mock the rule of law and opens the door for others to do the same. “All of these people have been blown up without us knowing their name, without any evidence of a crime,” Republican Sen. Rand Paul said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday. “If they want all-out war where we kill anybody and everybody that is in the country of Venezuela or coming out, that has to have a declaration of war,” the Kentucky Republican said. “It’s something that is not pretty, very expensive, and I’m not in favor of declaring war on Venezuela, but Congress should vote. The president shouldn’t do this by himself.”\n► Trump last week detailed his decision to authorize covert CIA operations in Venezuela, prompting debate over a possible regime-change strategy against the brutal rule of President Nicolás Maduro. On Sunday, Trump stoked speculation of further US military action in the Western Hemisphere, warning that if Colombian President Gustavo Petro didn’t “close up these killing fields” where drugs are produced, “the United States will close them up for him and it won’t be done nicely.”\nCurtailing drugs trafficking might be a laudable goal, but Trump’s methods threaten to bolster an imperial presidency and change America’s global reputation. His administration’s refusal to produce evidence of its claims or to try to build support for a potential military campaign is another example of contempt for the democratic process — one that is fueled by the genuflection of most Republicans in Congress.\nThe saga is unfolding as Hegseth’s Defense Department has kicked out journalists who refused to sign the administration’s draconian new press regulations. The civilian leadership of Pentagon looks scared of scrutiny — a position that risks eroding public support for the military. That possibility is only reinforced by the administration’s determination to deploy troops on American soil.\nProtesters challenge the administration’s dismissal of demonstrations\nTrump aides tried to diminish and defame the “No Kings” protests that drew millions of people to more than 2,700 events in 50 states and were largely peaceful. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt claimed the Democratic Party’s constituency was made up of “Hamas terrorists, illegal aliens, and violent criminals.” House Speaker Mike Johnson branded them “hate America” rallies made up of the “pro-Hamas wing” and “the Antifa people.”\nThere is a seam of the Democratic base nurtured by left-wing protest movements that many centrist Americans regard as extreme. But impressions gathered around the country by CNN reporters also indicated that many people with more moderate views also took part in protests that felt like block parties to register concerns about a president many of them see as un-American. Demonstrators dressed as frogs, chickens and Statues of Liberty mocked the unhinged rhetoric of the administration about the protests just as effectively as the president’s vulgar social media posts mocked them.\nPeople gather along a waterfront park during a \"No Kings\" protest in Portland, Oregon, on Saturday.\nJenny Kane/AP\n“We have millions of people turning out today,” Colleen Connell, executive director of the Illinois chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, told CNN’s Fredricka Whitfield on Saturday. “There are clearly more of us than there are of those who want an autocracy or a dictatorship. And so the message is pretty clear that we, the people, you know, own this country and that we are going to respect the rule of law and we are going to stand up and we are going to protect our democracy with peaceful protest and peaceful dissent.”\nIn time, Saturday’s protests may come to be seen not just as a reaction to Trump’s first nine months in power but as a harbinger of greater resistance to come.\nAt the least, they show that while many of Trump’s supporters back tough-guy policies like expanding Immigrations and Custom Enforcement raids and extrajudicial executions of claimed drugs traffickers on the high seas, many other Americans don’t.\nAnd while warnings of encroaching authoritarianism may initially have seemed overblown, growing numbers of Americans seem to think that sitting on the sidelines is untenable. This follows a warning by Obama on Marc Maron’s final podcast that it wouldn’t be a huge sacrifice for more Americans to make their views known a year before midterm elections. “We’re not at the stage where you have to be like Nelson Mandela and be in a 10-by-12 jail cell for 27 years and break rocks,” the former president said.\nOrganizers claimed 7 million protesters came out at the weekend. If that’s true, that means nearly 10% of the 75 million people who voted for Kamala Harris last November left their homes to join a protest.\nA person dressed as former US President George Washington displays a sign during a \"No Kings\" protest in Boston on Saturday.\nBrian Snyder/Reuters\nA protester dressed in a Statue of Liberty costume takes part in a \"No Kings\" protest in New York on Saturday.\nOlga Fedorova/AP\nRetired government worker Peggy Cole of Flint, Michigan, told CNN’s Veronica Stracqualursi she traveled to Washington for a protest because it was a “scary time.”\n“It seems to me, (Trump is) taking our government, our democracy, and dismantling it piece by piece, slowly, but surely, if we sit by and don’t do anything about it,” Cole said.\nAsked for comment about the protests, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson wrote back: “Who cares?”\nThat’s a response that breathes contempt for the values protesters claim to be protecting. But it also reveals a White House that believes its increasingly monarchical leader has no need to listen to the aspirations of those he regards as below him.\nIn some ways, Trump is proving the protesters’ point.","summary":"A president steeped in constitutional lore might have been offended by claims he’s acting as a king.

If that’s true, that means nearly 10% of the 75 million people who voted for Kamala Harris last November left their homes to join a protest.\n\nRetired government worker Peggy Cole of Flint, Michigan, told CNN’s Veronica Stracqualursi she traveled to Washington for a protest because it was a “scary time.”\n\n“It seems to me, (Trump is) taking our government, our democracy, and dismantling it piece by piece, slowly, but surely, if we sit by and don’t do anything about it,” Cole said.\n\nAsked for comment about the protests, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson wrote back: “Who cares?”\n\nThat’s a response that breathes contempt for the values protesters claim to be protecting. But it also reveals a White House that believes its increasingly monarchical leader has no need to listen to the aspirations of those he regards as below him.\n\nIn some ways, Trump is proving the protesters’ point.","summary":"A president steeped in constitutional lore might have been offended by claims he’s acting as a king.

If you believe Donald Trump doesn't have a right to live, that is more than a \"perceived\" anti-Trump bias.\n\nNear the end, Grynbaum and Mullin nitpicked Weiss's social media posts, like mocking Zohran Mamdani: \"CBS News declined to comment on whether Ms. Weiss’s expression of strong opinions on major news events ran afoul of its ethics rules, or belied CBS News’s efforts to appear nonpartisan.\" \n\nStop!

Mr Davie, 58, said the BBC stood against racism but it was “not appropriate for a journalist who may be covering that issue to be campaigning in that way”. He was speaking at the Sunday Times Culture Interview Forum at the Cheltenham Literature Festival. Speaking about diversity and impartiality at the BBC, Mr Davie said: “I feel very, very strongly that if you walk into the BBC newsroom, you cannot be holding a Kamala Harris mug when you come to the election, no way, that’s not even acceptable. “You cannot have any assumption about where people are politically, you leave it at the door, and your religion is journalism in the BBC, and I tell you, the problem I’ve got is people react quite chemically to that. So you can’t come into the newsroom with a Black Lives Matter T-shirt on, we stand absolutely firmly against racism in any form. “I find some of the hatred in society at the moment utterly abhorrent, personally, really upsetting, but that is a campaign that has politicised objectives, therefore it is not appropriate for a journalist who may be covering that issue to be campaigning in that way. “And for some people joining the BBC, that is a very difficult thing to accept, and it has not been an easy thing to get done this, and we wrestle with it every day.” Earlier in the interview, Mr Davie said his “number one priority” was “trying to navigate a course where you are impartial” and that required “elements of diversity”, adding that “socioeconomic diversity” was something that “hadn’t (been) talked about enough”. He added: “It is absolutely a big battle, and I’m getting questions, ‘why are you giving a voice to Reform?’, ‘why are you doing this?’, we’re not giving a voice, we’re covering, covering what people are interested in, covering the reality of what people feel.” Mr Davie was also asked whether he felt safe when he had been “shouted at” and people had “come into (his) personal space”. He said: “It’s not for the faint-hearted, these jobs in public life now, I mean, they are really quite demanding.

I was angry and sad,' she said.\n\n'I was enraged and heartbroken that this man had given more than 50 years of his life to serving the American people and, in the end, he'd be treated poorly by members of his own party. It was horrible.'\n\nShe noted that the 'Democratic Party had defined my life, my career.\n\n'Everything I'd done to make people's lives better had been connected to it,' Jean-Pierre wrote.\n\n'The party was the vehicle that allowed me not to just have a front seat to history, working first on [Barack] Obama's presidential campaign then in his administration, but also to make some history of my own as the first black woman and openly queer person to ever be a White House press secretary,' wrote Jean-Pierre, who worked as a political director for Obama.\n\nShe also recounted how she ultimately made the decision to abandon the party when she appeared on The View - in her first public appearance following the bombshell news.\n\n'Now the cloud of unease hovering over me solidified into an idea about how I could possibly do something different. How I could channel my disappointment into some kind of concrete action that would allow me to fight for what I believed in without giving blind loyalty to a party I felt no longer deserved it,' Jean-Pierre remembered thinking.\n\n'You know what? I'm going to become an independent,' she continued. 'I don't think I can stomach being in the Democratic Party anymore.' \n\nJean-Pierre's memoir has been described as an 'urgent, timely analysis' with publisher Hatchette urging Americans to 'vote their values and maintain individuality within party lines.'\n\nBut some of her former colleagues have hit out at the former press secretary, whom they accused of being a 'grifter' for cashing in with the book.\n\n'I laughed reading her book announcement that claims she “presents clear arguments and provocative evidence” when our party failed to make a compelling argument for Democrats with her as one of our most visible messenger for three years,' one former Biden administration official told DailyMail.com.\n\n'Probably best to purge the party of our most delusional and self-serving personalities,' the former official added. \n\nAnother operative told Politico it was 'the most grift-y thing I’ve seen in a long time, and that’s saying something in Washington.' \n\nFormer White House official Symone Sanders-Townsend, a former advisor to VP Kamala Harris, also wrote on X that 'a lot of group chats were revived today,' with former Biden State Department spokesman Vedant Patel saying he was 'counting 13 on my end.'\n\n She has previously referenced some of the scores she planned to settle during an interview in February at the Institute of Politics at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government.\n\nAt the time, she told how the 'toughest thing to see' was a 'firing squad' during the weeks after Biden's debate, when party stalwarts pushed him to drop out - arguing he could not defeat Donald Trump with his lousy approval ratings.\n\n'I had never seen anything like it before,' she intoned. 'I had never seen a party do that in the way that they did. And it was hurtful and sad to see that happening – a firing squad around a person who I believe was a true patriot.' \n\nHer new book, which runs 256 pages, is set to go on sale on Tuesday.","summary":"Former President Joe Biden 's press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre has revealed she was left feeling 'enraged and heartbroken' by her ex-boss.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15207249/Karine-Jean-Pierre-enraged-heartbroken-Democrats-Biden.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/10/19/23/103124579-0-image-m-15_1760912400956.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/06/04/7775952641450097928/1024x576_MP4_7775952641450097928.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-20 03:34:32","author":"Editor,Melissa Koenig","authors":["Editor","Melissa Koenig"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.422},{"id":370886652,"title":"Donald Trump’s Handshakes Keep Getting Weirder—And No One Escapes the Awkwardness","text":"Donald Trump’s handshakes have always been more than greetings, they’re performances. No matter the setting, his signature clasps, pulls, and tugs often reveal more about his insecurities than his strength. \n\nWhat should show confidence instead exposes what one critic jokingly described as a “lack of self-esteem.” His exaggerated gestures have often turned him into viral meme materials with each new handshake adding to the ever-growing list of awkward encounters.\n\nDuring his viral 2024 presidential debate with Kamala Harris, Trump’s handshake made waves. Observers and body language experts took to social media, calling his behavior “petulant” and “emotionally immature.” \n\nWhat made it even worse for Trump was Harris’s composed reaction as that further highlighted the President’s desperation. \n\nHis face-off with French President Emmanuel Macron in 2017 became another instant classic. Their 29-second grip battle seemed less like a handshake and more like a test of endurance. Macron refused to yield, matching Trump squeeze for squeeze. \n\nTheir tightly bound hands reflected the chilly tenor of the U.S.–Europe relations, each trying to outdo the other in subtle aggression. It was less a diplomatic greeting and more a wrist-wrestling event on live television.\n\nThen there is his encounter with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the 2019 G-20 Summit. The two men locked hands in Trump’s trademark clasp-and-yank move. A viral post joked, “Trump shakes Putin’s hand. You can tell who the real alpha in the room is.” Putin’s calm smirk said it all, he didn’t need to wrestle for control. Trump’s overcompensation turned what could have been camaraderie into comedy.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, meanwhile, met Trump’s handshake games with a steady grip. In 2017, a viral post read, “Trump goes in for the signature j—— handshake but Trudeau is all ‘no, I am the alpha here.’” \n\nTrudeau’s composed resistance turned the moment into a symbolic tug-of-war between two world leaders, one desperate for control, the other effortlessly in charge. Their white-knuckle handshake showed that sometimes restraint wins the power game.\n\nHere’s Donald Trump and Macron sharing an awkward handshake!\nWhat was Macron thinking at that moment?\npic.twitter.com/qrLcYqaoaP\n— Lucas Sanders 💙🗳️🌊💪🌈🚺🟧 (@LucasSa56947288) October 13, 2025\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom’s 2025 meeting with Trump added another round to these handshake theatrics. The two men, political adversaries for years, faced off amid California’s wildfire crisis. \n\nNewsom spoke firmly, while Trump’s handshake turned almost comically aggressive. Observers dubbed it a “seesaw showdown.” As one commentator quipped, “Can anyone say ‘cringe?’” It became yet another meme-worthy episode in Trump’s long history of overplayed dominance displays.\n\nEven royalty wasn’t spared. In May 2025, Trump greeted the Emir of Qatar, Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, with what one witness called a “hard-pump double pull-in.” He ended it with a firm pat on the arm, completing what many described as the quintessential “Trump touch.” A video of the handshake went viral as audiences cringed and laughed in equal measure.\n\nThe spectacle continued when Trump met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in April 2025. Communications advisor Margo Martin posted a clip from Mar-a-Lago, where Trump declared, “The greatest dinner I’ve ever had,” before pulling Netanyahu into an intense, clasped-hand fist pump. \n\nThe awkwardness was palpable as both leaders smiled through a grip that looked more like an arm wrestle than a greeting. The exaggerated motion once again betrayed Trump’s fixation with asserting power.\n\nBut perhaps the most infamous moment dates back to 2017, when Trump congratulated Neil Gorsuch on his appointment to the Supreme Court. Standing before the press, Trump grabbed Gorsuch’s hand and yanked him inward twice before adding what one observer described as a “condescending triple pat.” \n\nA viral clip captured the bizarre exchange, noting how the “macho handshake” lingered uncomfortably long. Gorsuch’s strained smile said more than words could, this was a man caught in the President’s dominance ritual.\n\nEach of these moments, from Harris to Putin to Gorsuch, painfully highlights Trump’s repeated and failed attempts to show power. He tries too hard and the result is always the same, which makes him look underconfident and way too eager to assert dominance.","summary":"Trump’s awkward handshakes reveal insecurity, not strength or confidence.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/donald-trumps-handshakes-keep-getting-weirder-and-no-one-escapes-the-awkwardness","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Donald-Trump-continues-his-infamous-handshakes1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-20 03:28:39","author":"Pramila Tripathi","authors":["Pramila Tripathi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.127},{"id":370782974,"title":"Former Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre Leaves Democratic Party over 'Horrible' Treatment of President Biden","text":"Former White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre has left the Democratic Party due to its “horrible” treatment of former President Joe Biden.\n\nDuring the 2024 presidential election, Joe Biden successfully secured his party’s nomination but later withdrew his candidacy after Democrat leadership insisted he drop out due to his age and potential cognitive issues. Democrats based this on Biden’s poor debate performance against Trump that summer, during which he appeared slow and confused at times. After dropping out, Biden’s then-Vice President Kamala Harris secured her party’s nomination despite no primary race before losing to President Donald Trump in a landslide that November.\n\nIn an excerpt in her new memoir, Karine Jean-Pierre said the treatment Biden received turned her away from the Democratic Party, describing herself now as an independent.\n\n“Biden seemed to be totally at peace with his decision, but I was stunned, my feelings a blur.

Success in the key Nov 4 mayoral and gubernatorial elections could help translate into victories next year, when control of both chambers of Congress will be up for grabs, strategists say.\n\nOne reason Trump won last year was that same economic anxiety. But Democrats argue that Trump slapping high tariffs on imports and his “Big Beautiful” tax bill have only made things worse.\n\nWhile inflation overall has cooled during Trump’s presidency, staples such as food, housing and power remain significantly more expensive than just a few years ago. Grocery prices are up 2.7pc over a year ago, according to the US Bureau of Labour Statistics, while home electricity costs have jumped 6.2pc and home gas prices have shot up 13.8pc over a year ago.\n\nAfter record-breaking price increases in 2021 and 2022, home values have continued to rise, though at a slower pace, now closer to 3pc annually. But rent and shelter costs, which factor heavily into the Consumer Price Index, haven’t meaningfully cooled. The cost of medical services excluding prescription drugs has increased 4.2pc in the last year.\n\nAbout half of Americans polled in a June Reuters/Ipsos poll said they were “very concerned” about the cost of living. The issue is something of a thorn in Trump’s side: In another Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted this month, just 27pc of respondents said they approved of his performance on the cost of living. Meanwhile, the price of imported goods has shot up 4pc during Trump’s time in office, with the cost of domestic goods increasing 2pc, according to an analysis this month. But while polls show voters are increasingly unhappy with Trump’s handling of the economy, they continue to trust Republicans more than Democrats to fix it.\n\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll in September found Americans were more likely to trust the Republican Party over the Democratic Party (34pc to 24pc) on managing economic policy. Trump has repeatedly boasted about his economic record, arguing he’s lowered prices and inflation and that his tariff regime is a success. “We’ve had the best economy we’ve ever had,” he said at a Cabinet meeting this month.\n\nA way forward\n\nThe Democratic Party has spent much of 2025 trying to figure out what went wrong last year.\n\nTim Walz, Kamala Harris’s vice-presidential nominee, has toured states speaking to party officials about his ticket’s failure to reassure voters about their everyday concerns.\n\nMamdani, Sherrill and Spanberger, the three most high-profile candidates running this year, have responded by promoting affordability as a central campaign theme.\n\nSpanberger’s Affordable Virginia plan focuses on lowering healthcare, housing, and energy costs. Part of the plan would seek to force tech data centres to pay their fair share of electricity costs. A former CIA officer, she has also emphasised how federal job cuts and the US government shutdown are damaging her state, which is reliant on federal jobs.\n\nSherrill’s Affordability Agenda targets similar cost-of-living concerns. She has pledged to declare a statewide energy emergency and freeze rates. Housing, healthcare, and utility costs I’ll tackle them immediately, Sherrill said during a debate with Republican opponent Jack Ciattarelli this month.\n\nCiattarelli is also promoting his “affordability agenda” — one that cuts taxes and regulations and argues that Sherrill’s plans are anti-growth. Recent polls show that Sherrill’s lead over Ciattarelli is hovering around 6 percentage points. Spanberger’s lead over her opponent, Lieutenant Governor Winsome Earle-Sears, has fluctuated between 3 and 10 points, depending on the poll.\n\nMamdani’s agenda includes a rent freeze, free bus service, universal childcare, and city-run grocery stores. He has drawn fire from Republicans, who cast him as a radical, and from some Democrats, including his rival for mayor, Andrew Cuomo, who argues that Mamdani’s policies are unworkable and would lead to large tax increases.\n\nA Quinnipiac University poll released last week showed Mamdani with a 13-point lead over Cuomo. Rebecca Katz, a New York Democratic operative whose firm, Fight, has produced ads on behalf of Mamdani’s campaign, warned that Democrats would be imprudent to dismiss his success. If and when he wins in November, Democrats shouldn’t write him off, Katz said. They should look at why his message resonated.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 20th, 2025","summary":"Democratic candidates Zohran Mamdani of New York City and Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey are separated by a river, but the gulf between them would appear to be larger than that.

But ask people what defines the movement’s cultural identity, and their answers don’t always match how MAGA sees itself.\n\nFor starters, the public is well aware of the movement. A YouGov poll from July found that 51% of Americans have heard “a lot” about MAGA, and 36% have heard a little. What’s striking, though, is who’s paying the closest attention: A higher share of Democrats (62%) than Republicans (48%) have heard a lot, suggesting their view of MAGA’s culture may be shaped more by outside narratives than by the movement's actual cultural touchstones.\n\nWhen asked what cultural touchstones define MAGA Republicans, Americans tend to associate the movement with a very specific set of symbols: American flags (55%), Confederate flags (49%), the Trump-friendly musician Kid Rock (48%), Trump’s old reality show “The Apprentice” (44%), and podcaster Joe Rogan (39%).\n\nMAGA Republicans see themselves somewhat differently, though. American flags (87%) and Kid Rock (66%) still figure highly on what they consider to be their movement’s touchstones, but they also consider Clint Eastwood (52%), steak (48%), and Ted Nugent (46%) to be up there. \n\nDemocrats have their own picture of what MAGA likes: Confederate flags (77%), “The Apprentice” (60%), and Kid Rock (59%) lead the list. But only 51% associate American flags with the movement.\n\nYouGov asked about 40 cultural figures and symbols in total, though it’s not clear how they landed on these specific options. That’s a limitation of polling: Had respondents been given a blank sheet to describe their cultural identity, the answers might have looked very different.\n\nStill, one pattern stands out. \n\n“The uniting factor in a lot of this does seem to be the proximity of these symbols to Trump, which is not totally surprising given who MAGA is,” said Rachel Blum, a political science professor at the University of Oklahoma. “In that respect, they seem to share an opinion with the rest of the country: that some proximity to Trump is what defines them culturally.”\n\nBig cultural fault lines run between the MAGA and non-MAGA wings of the Republican base. \n\nTwo-thirds of MAGA Republicans tie the movement to Kid Rock—twice the share of non-MAGA Republicans who say the same. The pattern repeats elsewhere: 87% of MAGA Republicans associate the movement with American flags, while only 56% of their non-MAGA counterparts do. The gap is wide on many others too, such as Clint Eastwood, Tim Allen, and even steak. \n\nBlum says some of this can be explained by “differences of intensity.” Republicans may like many of the same things, but MAGA Republicans identify with them more strongly.\n\nThe split is even more stark with Rogan. Sixty percent of MAGA Republicans say they “like” or “love” Rogan, but just 25% of non-MAGA Republicans feel the same. Rogan endorsed Trump ahead of last year’s election, but recently, the podcaster has been more critical. That suggests Rogan’s support among the MAGA base might be less about what he’s saying now and more about what he said before.\n\n“This seems like a good example of a place where that ‘like’ for Rogan is symbolic,” Blum said. “These people aren’t actually listening to his podcast. They just appreciate that this prominent podcaster supported their candidate, and they’re rewarding him for that.”\n\n“There’s an extent to which conservatives have long felt that they’ve been left out of the culture or that the culture is biased against them,” she added. “So, you could see them being almost grateful when an important cultural figure seems like they’re finally on their side.”\n\nNot everything tied to MAGA is overtly political, though.\n\nTake steak and hamburgers for example. They’re hardly niche items, yet they’ve been absorbed into the MAGA cultural identity. That’s partly because food choices do break along party lines, according to some polls. Only 5% of Americans identify as vegetarian and 2% as vegan, but Democrats (35%) are quite a bit more likely than Republicans (21%) to say they’re cutting back on eating meat, according to a 2018 poll from YouGov for The Economist.\n\nAmong MAGA Republicans, meat is central to their cultural identity. Ninety-one percent say they like or love steak, and 90% say the same of hamburgers. Democrats also express broad enthusiasm for steak and burgers, though MAGA’s embrace of red meat has taken on a kind of cultural signaling of its own.\n\nBut MAGA’s cultural identity isn’t just about what its people consume—it’s also about what they tune out.\n\nIn recent months, Trump supporters have largely avoided the late-night shows the president rails against. A YouGov poll from September found just 4% of Republicans and 6% of Trump voters watch late-night TV every day, compared with 9% of Democrats and 12% of those who voted for Kamala Harris, last year’s Democratic presidential nominee. More than half of Republicans (51%) said they never watch late-night programs, roughly double the share of Democrats (27%).\n\nThat gap reflects more than viewing habits. For many, skipping late night is a political statement.\n\nA similar cultural split is playing out with Taylor Swift. Her megastardom has accelerated during Trump’s second term, even as he lob insults her way—twice dismissing her as no longer “HOT.” But this isn’t just celebrity gossip. Swift has become a clear partisan marker.\n\nAccording to an Navigator Research poll from August, Swift’s net favorability among Democrats is +49 percentage points, and among independents, it’s +8 points. But with Republicans, it’s -22 points—a stunning swing from two years earlier, when it was +15 points. That shift accelerated after Swift endorsed Harris over Trump, with the steepest drop among voters without college degrees. \n\nWhat was once neutral pop-culture terrain has turned into another front in the culture wars.\n\nOf course, expressed preferences don’t always reflect real-life behavior. Do people who say they dislike Swift actually stop listening to her music? Have right-leaning fans of late-night host Stephen Colbert actually tuned out? Polling can’t tell us that—but it’s a reminder that cultural identity is often messier than a clean partisan split.\n\nThere are other, quieter signals too. Republicans are less likely than Democrats to have read a book in the past year—62% vs. 73%—though majorities in both groups still have, according to a recent YouGov poll. Republicans are also most likely to report owning just one to four books, while Democrats clustered between owning 10 and 24.\n\nThat divide mirrors a broader realignment along educational lines. \n\nData from the well-regarded American National Election Studies shows that in the 1980s, Democrats held a 14-point edge with non-college-educated voters, while Republicans led by 5 points among college graduates. Now, that dynamic has flipped: Democrats’ working-class advantage has all but disappeared, while their lead with college-educated voters has surged to 14 points. \n\nDemocrats have become the party of the educated class—a strength that could also become a ceiling if they can’t reconnect with working-class voters.\n\nReading habits aren’t destiny, though. YouGov also found Republicans and Democrats were about equally likely to have a library card, a small reminder that cultural divides aren’t always as stark as they seem.\n\nOf course, a few polls don’t tell the full story, and we shouldn’t rush to stereotype anyone based on a handful of numbers. Still, these early glimpses give us a sense—however tentative—of what being MAGA looks like culturally, and they raise questions we’ll be watching as the movement continues to evolve.\n\nAny updates?\n\n New polling from The Economist/YouGov offers a snapshot of how Americans are navigating the ongoing government shutdown. A majority of Americans (54%) say they haven’t felt any personal impact from the shutdown so far. (Maybe they haven’t tried to catch a flight lately.) Still, 45% are optimistic it will end within a month, even though Democrats and Republicans remain deadlocked. And there’s strong agreement that federal workers should be made whole once this staring contest is over: 71% say those workers should receive back pay. Americans are also pushing back on Trump’s threats to use the shutdown to slash the federal workforce. A majority (54%) oppose the idea of permanently firing workers—likely because, at its core, it’s clearly unfair.\n\n The White House has embraced artificial intelligence, with first lady Melania Trump recently launching an “AI Challenge” for students and teachers to develop AI projects. But the public remains far more wary of AI. A new Pew Research Center report finds that 50% of U.S. adults are more concerned than excited about the higher use of AI in daily life, compared with just 10% who say they feel more excitement than fear. \n\n Two weeks ago, polls showed voters blaming Trump and Republicans for the government shutdown. But as the standoff drags on, a new AP-NORC poll shows the Democrats’ political advantage slipping. Fifty-eight percent say Trump and congressional Republicans bear “a great deal” or “quite a bit” of responsibility, while 54% say the same of congressional Democrats. Earlier polling showed Republicans more clearly on the hook. But now both parties are under fire, signaling that the shutdown is no longer a one-sided political liability—and that Democrats may face a tougher messaging fight than expected.\n\nWith high-profile elections looming in November, it’s easy to forget another fast-approaching deadline: the holidays—and for many, that means shopping for gifts.\n\nYouGov finds that 22% of U.S. adults have already started or will start this month, but most are waiting: 36% plan to begin in November, and 13% will hold off until December.\n\nI’ll admit it—gift-giving is one of my love languages, so I rarely set a budget. Most people are more disciplined, though: 56% will set a strict or rough spending limit, and 14% say they won’t shop at all this year, whether by choice or rising costs.\n\nAmong those shopping, plans vary: 17% plan to spend $100-$249 on holiday gifts this year, 21% say $250-$499, and 17% say $500-$1,000. \n\nI’ll probably land in the middle—big family, big love for gifts.

Despite their differences, all three have zeroed in on what Democrats hope will be a winning strategy that carries over to the 2026 midterm elections: the high cost of living for everyday Americans. Each campaign is channeling the same voter frustration – that everything from energy to healthcare to groceries feels increasingly unaffordable.\n\n“That is the pain point right now with voters,” said Mark Riddle, president of Future Majority, a Democratic firm that conducts voter research. “And they’re blaming Trump.”\n\nDemocrats seek to use Trump’s economy against him\n\nSince Democrats lost both the White House and Congress last year, the party has been searching for a policy framework and fresh voices. Success in the key Nov. 4 mayoral and gubernatorial elections could help translate into victories next year, when control of both chambers of Congress will be up for grabs, strategists say.\n\nOne reason Trump won last year was that same economic anxiety. But Democrats argue that Trump slapping high tariffs on imports and his “Big Beautiful” tax bill have only made things worse.\n\nWhile inflation overall has cooled during Trump’s presidency, staples such as food, housing and power remain significantly more expensive than just a few years ago. Grocery prices are up 2.7% over a year ago, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, while home electricity costs have jumped 6.2% and home gas prices have shot up 13.8% over a year ago.\n\nAfter record-breaking price increases in 2021 and 2022, home values have continued to rise, though at a slower pace — now closer to 3% annually. But rent and shelter costs, which factor heavily into the Consumer Price Index, haven’t meaningfully cooled. The cost of medical services excluding prescription drugs has increased 4.2% in the last year.\n\nAbout half of Americans polled in a June Reuters/Ipsos poll said they were “very concerned” about the cost of living. The issue is something of a thorn in Trump’s side: In another Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted this month, just 27% of respondents said they approved of his performance on the cost of living. Meanwhile, the price of imported goods has shot up 4% during Trump’s time in office, with the cost of domestic goods increasing 2%, according to a Reuters’ analysis this month. But while polls show voters are increasingly unhappy with Trump’s handling of the economy, they continue to trust Republicans more than Democrats to fix it. A Reuters/Ipsos poll in September found Americans were more likely to trust the Republican Party over the Democratic Party (34% to 24%) on managing economic policy.\n\nTrump has repeatedly boasted about his economic record, arguing he’s lowered prices and inflation and that his tariffs regime is a success.\n\n“We’ve had the best economy we’ve ever had,” he said at a Cabinet meeting this month.\n\nSearching for a way forward\n\nThe Democratic Party has spent much of 2025 trying to figure out what went wrong last year. Tim Walz, Kamala Harris’ vice-presidential nominee, has toured states speaking to party officials about his ticket’s failure to reassure voters about their everyday concerns.\n\nMamdani, Sherrill and Spanberger, the three most high-profile candidates running this year, have responded by promoting affordability as a central campaign theme.\n\nSpanberger’s “Affordable Virginia” plan focuses on lowering healthcare, housing, and energy costs. Part of the plan would seek to force tech data centers to pay “their fair share” of electricity costs. A former CIA officer, she has also emphasized how federal job cuts and the U.S. government shutdown is damaging her state, which is reliant on federal jobs.\n\nSherrill’s “Affordability Agenda” targets similar cost-of-living concerns. She has pledged to declare a statewide energy emergency and freeze rates.\n\n“Housing, healthcare, and utility costs — I’ll tackle them immediately,” Sherrill said during a debate with Republican opponent Jack Ciattarelli this month.\n\nCiattarelli is also promoting his “affordability agenda” – one that cuts taxes and regulations and argues that Sherrill’s plans are anti-growth.\n\nRecent polls show that Sherrill’s lead over Ciattarelli is hovering around 6 percentage points. Spanberger’s lead over her opponent, Lieutenant Governor Winsome Earle-Sears, has fluctuated between 3 and 10 points, depending on the poll.\n\nMamdani’s agenda includes a rent freeze, free bus service, universal childcare, and city-run grocery stores. He has drawn fire from Republicans, who cast him as a radical, and from some Democrats, including his rival for mayor, Andrew Cuomo, who argues that Mamdani’s policies are unworkable and would lead to large tax increases.\n\nA Quinnipiac University poll released last week showed Mamdani with a 13-point lead over Cuomo.\n\nRebecca Katz, a New York Democratic operative whose firm, Fight, has produced ads on behalf of Mamdani’s campaign, warned that Democrats would be imprudent to dismiss his success.\n\n“If and when he wins in November, Democrats shouldn’t write him off,” Katz said. “They should look at why his message resonated.”","summary":"Democratic candidates Zohran Mamdani of New York City and Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey are separated by a river, but the gulf between them would appear to be larger than that. Mamdani, favored to become New York&#8217;s mayor, is a self-described democratic socialist. Sherrill, who aspires to be her state&#8217;s next governor, is a former Navy helicopter pilot and centrist trying to woo moderates back to her party.","url":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2025/10/19/breaking-news/looking-for-a-way-forward-democrats-zero-in-on-affordability/","image":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/web1_2025-10-19T061731Z_1561081905_RC2G6HA1TNLU_RTRMADP_3_USA-ELECTION-DEMOCRATS.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-19 22:07:00","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.107},{"id":370755344,"title":"FBI and Secret Service Discover Hunting Stand Potentially Linked to Assassination Attempt Against Trump","text":"FBI Director Kash Patel reported on X that the U.S. Secret Service discovered on Thursday a “suspicious hunting stand near the [Air Force One] zone in Palm Beach.” The FBI is currently investigating this find as a potential threat to President Donald Trump.\n\n“Prior to the president’s return to West Palm Beach, USSS discovered what appeared to be an elevated hunting stand within sight line of the Air Force One landing zone,” Patel said on Fox News.\n\n“No individuals were located at the scene.

As the editor-in-chief of CBS News, Weiss posed a challenging question that caught the journalists off guard: why do viewers perceive their reporting as biased?\n\nThe 41-year-old, who champions political neutrality as a core value for the network, directed this pointed inquiry at the team on Tuesday, according to a report by The New York Times. Her question, simple yet profound, was met with silence from the room, which includes some of the most prominent figures in American journalism.\n\nWeiss’s inquiry reportedly created an awkward atmosphere, as noted by three anonymous sources familiar with the meeting.\n\nThe question was directed at a group of seasoned reporters, including Anderson Cooper, who also serves as a prominent anchor at CNN, and Lesley Stahl. These reporters pride themselves on their commitment to impartiality, insiders revealed.\n\nDespite claims from former President Donald Trump and other conservative voices suggesting a leftist bias, the 60 Minutes team has consistently denied such allegations, defending their work as objective and balanced.\n\nThey have fiercely rejected the idea perpetuated by Donald Trump and other conservatives that their coverage is left-leaning. \n\nWeiss has already caused a stir in her first two weeks filling the network’s top position, in which she vowed to provide news for the American ‘mainstream’ who have been ‘ill-served’ by the media. \n\nHer background as a vocal opinion journalist with no previous broadcast experience has made her a controversial pick for editor-in-chief. \n\nShe co-founded The Free Press, which Paramount Skydance is acquiring, and formerly worked as a NY Times opinion editor, but left the role due to the company’s ‘illiberal environment’ in 2020. \n\nWhile her official start date at CBS News was October 6, an insider previously told the Daily Mail she had been ‘informally consulting’ the company for ‘a while.’ \n\nHer hiring by new Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison, the son of billionaire Trump ally Larry Ellison, made waves within the CBS newsroom after a tumultuous year.\n\nIn October last year, Donald Trump sued the network over a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris that he claimed was deceptively edited.\n\nParamount ultimately agreed to pay Trump $16 million to settle the lawsuit. \n\nThat settlement paved the way for the administration’s approval of an $8billion merger between Skydance Media and Paramount in August. \n\nCBS News – specifically 60 Minutes – was also heavily criticized for its coverage of the Israel-Gaza war.\n\nNetwork veteran Stahl specifically came under fire over her treatment of a Hamas hostage, with conservatives accusing her of being sympathetic towards the terrorist group in a damning April interview. \n\nStahl was slammed after she asked former hostage Keith Siegel if Hamas terrorists starved him on purpose or if they just did not have any food to hand out. \n\nSeigel, who spent 484 days in captivity, replied: ‘No, I think they starved me, and they would often eat in front of me and not offer me food.’ \n\nNot long after, 60 Minutes executive producer Bill Owens and CBS News CEO Wendy McMahon both resigned over concerns with the company’s direction. \n\nDespite his previous run-ins with CBS, Trump recently told CNN the network will be ‘fairer’ with Weiss and Ellison in charge. ‘CBS has great potential,’ he said.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nBari Weiss, known for her stance against progressive ideologies, recently left the&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Bari Weiss Leaves 60 Minutes Team Speechless with Bold Question on Media Bias first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/world-news/bari-weiss-leaves-60-minutes-team-speechless-with-bold-question-on-media-bias/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/CBS-News-editor-Bari-Weiss-stuns-60-Minutes-journalists-to.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-19 21:27:20","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.188}]}
