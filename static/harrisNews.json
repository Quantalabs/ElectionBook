Tim Walz, disclosed in a piece published in Glamour this week that the fertility treatments she underwent were intrauterine insemination treatments, rather than in vitro fertilization. \"Our fertility journey was an incredibly personal and difficult experience,\" she said, in discussing the IUI treatments. \"We hope other families find solace in our story.\" She said a neighbor who happened to be a nurse would come help with the \"shots I needed as part of the IUI process.\" She acknowledged that the reason she and her husband decided to talk about their struggle with infertility because of the threat to in vitro fertilization treatments, in particular, the Alabama Supreme Court ruling in February that frozen embryos made through IVF are children under the state's Wrongful Death of a Minor Act.\"I cannot fathom the cruelty of politicians who want to take away the freedom for couples to access the care they need,\" Gwen Walz told Glamour.The Walz family's use of fertility treatments isn't lost on Vice President Kamala Harris, who highlighted the couple's fertility journey in Philadelphia, at her first rally with Walz after she selected him to be her running mate. Harris has been a vocal advocate of reproductive technology, as well as women's access to abortion. And Walz, the governor of Minnesota, has spoken about infertility at campaign events since he became the VP nominee, crediting fertility treatments like IVF with helping his wife to conceive their two children. And as governor, Walz has voiced concern about Americans' access to IVF.\"Gwen and I have two beautiful children because of reproductive health care like IVF,\" Walz wrote on Facebook after the Alabama ruling. \"This issue is deeply personal to our family and so many others. Don't let these guys get away with this by telling you they support IVF when their handpicked judges oppose it.\" He told the Star Tribune in March that the couple underwent fertility treatments for seven years before Gwen became pregnant with their daughter, Hope. In early August, soon after his selection as Harris' running mate, other outlets referred to the family's \"IVF journey,\" although they did not quote Walz on the type of fertility treatments his wife had undergone. IUI treatment is an artificial insemination process that typically requires stimulant shots, as IVF does. But unlike IVF, an IUI treatment inserts sperm into the uterus to increase the chances of fertilization. IVF treatments involve the creation of embryos in a laboratory facility, and they are then transferred into the uterus. IVF currently faces a number of legal challenges, while IUI does not.\"This gets personal for me and my family,\" Tim Walz said earlier this month at the Philadelphia rally alongside Harris hours after being announced as her running mate. \"When my wife and I decided to have children we spent years going through infertility treatments. And I remember praying every night for a call for good news. The pit in my stomach when the phone rang, and the agony when we heard that the treatments hadn't worked. So, this wasn't by chance that when we welcomed my daughter into the world. We named her Hope.\"\"Governor Walz and Mrs. Walz have two children, Hope and Gus,\" the Harris campaign said in a statement. \"Governor Walz and Mrs. Walz struggled with years of fertility challenges and had their daughter, Hope, through reproductive health care like IVF — further cementing his commitment to ensuring all Americans have access to this care.\" IVF has been a topic of debate on Capitol Hill, too. After the Alabama ruling, the Senate voted on legislation in June to make IVF access a right nationally. All but two Senate Republicans voted to block the set of bills, and many maintained that they supported IVF access. Some Republicans called the push for the legislation a political stunt on the part of Democrats. \"Even if you've never gone through the hell of infertility, someone you know has,\" Walz wrote on social media. \"When Gwen and I were having trouble getting pregnant, the anxiety and frustration blotted out the sun. JD Vance opposing the miracle of IVF is a direct attack on my family and so many others.\"Vance, the Republican vice presidential nominee, was one of the majority of Senate Republicans who voted against the IVF package. After Gwen Walz's disclosure that she underwent IUI treatments, not IVF, Vance posted on X, \"Today it came out that Tim Walz had lied about having a family via IVF. Who lies about something like that?\"","summary":"Minnesota Gov.

Atlanta's own award-winning rapper Lil Jon helped spice up the DNC roll call by introducing Georgia's delegation. Performing \"Turn Down for What\" and \"Get Low,\" the Peach State native had one of the flashier entries in the ceremonial roll call. Lil Jon headlined the Georgia Democrats' Monday night kickoff, themed \"Window to the Walz\" at a Chicago nightclub. \"Mr. Secretary, the South got something to say,\" Rep. Nikema Williams, Democratic Party of Georgia chairwoman said. \"Y'all, when we send Kamala Harris to the White House, she'll fight for our freedom to vote, our reproductive freedom and our freedom to thrive in the spirit of 'good trouble,' Georgia cast 123 votes for the next president.\" Delegates to the Democratic National Convention held a ceremonial — and celebratory — roll call vote to mark what they’d already made official earlier this month with a virtual vote: Vice President Kamala Harris’ selection as the party’s presidential nominee. The unconventional roll call was facilitated by a DJ, with a unique songs playing as the call moved from state to state: \"Sweet Home Alabama\" by Lynyrd Skynyrd for Alabama, for example. Florida's song was \"Won't Back Down\" by Tom Petty (possibly a snarky reference to the Never Back Down, Inc., super PAC, set up to encourage Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis' unsuccessful presidential candidacy?). Loud cheers went up from the convention crowd as the voting moved from state to state. Participants announced their support for Harris and Walz, and touted their individual states' accomplishments, including the Hawaii delegation, which noted its status as the birthplace of former President Obama, and Illinois, where Obama won the first victory of his presidential campaign in the 2008 caucuses.","summary":"Atlanta's own award-winning rapper Lil Jon helped spice up the DNC roll call by introducing Georgia's delegation.","url":"https://www.npr.org/2024/08/20/g-s1-18170/lil-jon-democratic-national-convention","image":"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5630x3753+0+0/resize/5630x3753!/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F85%2F7b%2F333c91b54cfe80b16b09ce99c056%2Fgettyimages-2167642108.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-21 00:33:08","author":"Stephen Fowler","authors":["Stephen Fowler"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.388},{"id":254553950,"title":"Hulk Hogan Incites Crowd With Controversial Remark About Kamala Harris","text":"For a long time, Hulk Hogan was the most popular wrestler in the world.A 12-time world champion, Hogan was the face for both the WWE and WCW.In recent years, fans have called into question Hogan's ability in the ring, his fabrications of his past in the wrestling industry, and leaked recordings of Hogan using questionable language.Unfortunately, another video has surfaced that can be added to that list.In a video acquired by TMZ Sports, Hogan began to lead the crowd in a Stone Cold Steve Austin-style \"What?\" chant while promoting his new Real American Beer.The crowd work started simple enough, asking the audience if they wanted cocktails, crazy girls, beers, and muscles.However, things took a strange turn toward the political when he threatened to body slam and perform his signature Leg Drop on Vice President Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic Party nominee for President.\"You want me to bodyslam somebody?

Podcaster and self-described MAGA supporter Scott Adams also criticized the moment, writing on X, \"I'm going to go with 'weird' to describe Doug Emhoff and his daughter.\"Newsweek sent an email to Harris' campaign seeking comment Tuesday evening.Some conservatives also critiqued a moment between President Joe Biden and his youngest daughter, Ashely, who spoke at the DNC Monday night prior to Biden delivering the keynote speech. Johnson posted a video of Biden hugging his daughter on the DNC stage to his Instagram account, describing it as \"the most CRINGE moment\" of the convention's opening night.Democrats started labeling Republicans and their policies as \"creepy\" and \"weird\" last month, an attack first coined by Minnesota Governor and Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz that quickly picked up attention online. Trump's campaign has repeatedly dismissed the label, and the former president has responded to the attacks by calling Harris \"a weird person.\"Some users on X shot back at conservatives labeling Emhoff as \"weird\" by pointing to past photos of Trump with his oldest daughter, Ivanka Trump. The former president has faced backlash for making reported inappropriate comments about his daughter, who served as a White House advisor during her father's first term.During a 2006 appearance on ABC's The View, Trump said while sitting next to Ivanka that if she \"weren't my daughter, perhaps I'd be dating her.\" In a 2015 interview with Rolling Stone, Trump reportedly said that Ivanka is \"really something, and what a beauty, that one.

Republican defectors who have publicly disavowed former President Donald Trump are also taking the stage in Chicago. On Tuesday, former White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham — the third spokesperson tasked with heading the press operations of Trump’s White House during his term — addressed the floor of the United Center. Grisham spoke of her disaffection with the former president, noting that she “was one of his closest advisers.” “The Trump family became my family. I spent Easter, Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year’s all at Mar-a-Lago,” Grisham recalled. “I saw him when the cameras were off behind closed doors. Trump mocks his supporters, he calls them basement dwellers.” “He used to tell me: ‘It doesn’t matter what you say Stephanie. Say it enough, and people will believe you.’ But it does matter. What you say matters and what you don’t say matters,” Grisham added. The former press secretary recalled her resignation from the White House in the aftermath of Jan. 6. “I asked Melania [Trump] if we could at least tweet that while peaceful protest is the right of every American, there’s no place for lawlessness or violence. She replied with one word: no. I became the first senior staffer to resign that day.” Grisham is not the only prominent Republican figure addressing the convention. Former Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) is expected to take the stage on Thursday, and Former Georgia Lieutenant Governor Geoff Duncan is scheduled to speak on Wednesday. Former Trump supporter Kyle Sweetser, who in his words voted for Trump “not once, not twice, but three times,” also spoke on Tuesday, telling the convention floor that he’s “not left-wing” but that he believes “our leaders should bring out the best in us, not the worst.” “I’m voting for Kamala Harris because she’ll make us proud to be Americans,” Sweetser added. Earlier this week, retired Federal Appeals Court Judge J. Michael Luttig announced that he would be endorsing Vice President Harris over Trump. The prominent conservative legal scholar, who was appointed under George H.W. Bush, told CNN that “regrettably, in the presidential election of 2024 there is only one political party and one candidate for the presidency that can claim the mantle of defender and protector of America’s Democracy, the Constitution, and the Rule of Law.” “As a result, I will unhesitatingly vote for the Democratic Party’s candidate for the presidency of the United States, Vice President of the United States, Kamala Harris,” he added. Democrats want to make clear at the convention that there are plenty of other Republicans who feel similarly.","summary":"Stephanie Grisham is one of multiple anti-Trump Republicans to speak at the Democratic National Convention","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/stephanie-grisham-republicans-dnc-1235084114/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/stephanie-grisham-dnc.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-21 00:26:30","author":"Nikki McCann Ramirez,Ryan Bort","authors":["Nikki McCann Ramirez","Ryan Bort"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.062},{"id":254553902,"title":"LAURA INGRAHAM: Are Democrats already running out of ideas?","text":"Fox News host Laura Ingraham says Democrats are trying to \"crush\" Republicans, not work with them, on \"The Ingraham Angle.\" LAURA INGRAHAM: What happened to joy?

He said that while his event focused on tackling crime, the theme he saw at the DNC on Monday night was “lies” – predicting that former President Barack Obama would repeat that again when he takes the stage Tuesday night as the keynote speaker. “I think it was about lies. It was lies about me, all night long they were saying things that weren’t true,” Trump said. “Charlottesville has been disproven. Everything that they’ve said has been disproven. The French soldier thing that they do all the time has been disproven, in the French cemetery,” he added, denying making controversial remarks Democrats attribute to him, such as calling veterans “suckers and losers.” He then asserted that Democrats “are good at lying.” “Every single thing that they talked about. The immigration. How about inflation? We had no inflation and they had a lot and they said the reverse,” Trump said. “It was disinformation, misinformation, which is what they talk about all the time.” “It’s probably the same thing [that will happen tonight.] It’s just incredible. They get before the cameras and they make up stories. Like they’re storytellers,” he added. Trump said he agreed with the repeated line Monday night painting Vice President Kamala Harris’ as the “underdog” in the 2024 election – but that doesn’t mean she deserves sympathy. “She should be the underdog because she did such a bad job,” Trump told The Post in an exclusive interview, referring to Harris’ time as vice president handling the border. “The job that she did was a disgrace, and to think that she’s now running for president.” Harris has described her campaign with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as an “underdog” movement in her fight against Trump because she has limited time to speak to voters after President Biden dropped out of the race.

I made a lot of mistakes in my career. \"Well, I gave my best to you for 50 years. Like many of you, I've given my heart and soul to our nation, and I've been blessed a million times in return with the support of the American people.\" Biden passed the torch to Harris' hands, whom he referred to as \"vice president soon-to-be president Kamala Harris. The president called nominating Harris as his vice president the \"best decision I made my whole career.\" \"She's tough, she's experienced, and she has enormous integrity,\" Biden said of his vice president. \"Her story represents the best American story. She'll be president our children can look up to. \"She'll be a president we can all be proud of. She will be a historic president who puts her stamp on America's future.\" Biden became the first president since Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968 to decide not to seek reelection. More to follow...

And in what appears to be an attempt — and let’s be real, somewhat pathetic attempt — to troll the Kamala Harris campaign, the clip was edited to include Beyoncé’s song “Freedom.” Cool, bro. Harris was granted use of the song by the pop superstar less than a day after she entered the race, and the song is now indelibly linked to her historic campaign. TheWrap has reached out to Beyoncé’s reps for comment. Trump’s camp has a history of using songs without the artist’s permission, including, most recently, the Isaac Hayes-penned hit “Hold on I’m Coming.” The estate for the late R&B star has sued Trump for $3 million for the unlicensed use of the song, which they estimate has been used 100 times by the GOP campaign. The suit, which was filed in Georgia federal court, also names the Republican National Committee and conservative group Turning Point USA. In addition to the $150,000 fee per each use of the song, Hayes’ family also wants a disclaimer that they have not “authorized, endorsed, or permitted use of the Isaac Hayes Enterprises’ property at any point, now or in perpetuity throughout the universe” for the candidate. Previous musicians who have objected to Trump’s use of their songs include Bruce Springsteen, Adele, Celine Dion, Elton John, Steven Tyler of Aerosmith, the estate of George Harrison, Creedence Clearwater Revival and Earth Wind & Fire. X users were quick to point out the folly of trying to co-opt Beyonce and her song: Anna Maltese wrote, Oh, look, you’re trying to copy Kamala Harris, that’s cute! Of course, Beyonce might feel differently. Portland, Oregon-based Badd Company responded with, “And now you will be sued, again, for Copyright Infringement. You, folks, are destroying yourselves, good job!” @ZephyrRN1701G said, “Holy s–t…OH NO HE DIDN’T.

In her brief speech, Grisham said that she used to be not just a Trump supporter but also a \"true believer\" who became part of Trump's family and spent major holidays with him. \"I saw him when the cameras were off, behind closed doors. Trump mocks his supporters. He calls them basement dwellers,\" she said. Grisham shared a few anecdotes about her experience working with Trump, including a story about a hospital visit Trump made during the Covid pandemic and she said people were dying in the ICU. \"He was mad that the cameras were not watching him. He has no empathy, no morals and no fidelity to the truth,\" she said. \"He used to tell me, 'It doesn't matter what you say, Stephanie — say it enough and people will believe you.' But it does matter — what you say matters and what you don't say matters.\" Grisham said that on Jan. 6, 2021, she asked then-first lady Melania Trump if they could tweet out that while peaceful protest is the right of every American, \"there's no place for lawlessness or violence.\" \"She replied with one word: 'No,'\" she said. \"I became the first senior staffer to resign that day. I couldn't be part of the insanity any longer.\" Grisham explained that she was criticized when she served as press secretary because she never held a White House briefing in that role. \"It's because, unlike my boss, I never wanted to stand at that podium and lie,\" she said. \"Now here I am behind a podium advocating for a Democrat, and that's because I love my country more than my party. Kamala Harris tells the truth. She respects the American people, and she has my vote.\" Grisham served as Trump’s White House communications director and press secretary from July 2019 to April 2020 and then went on to be Melania Trump’s press secretary and chief of staff. In an interview on MSNBC after her remarks, Grisham said that if she can reach any undecided voters, she wants to convey that she understands what it's like to believe in Trump. But she praised Democrats for pushing a message of unity and said people may not agree on policies, but it's important to \"talk to each other like humans again.\" She said that the Harris campaign has been \"brilliant\" at communicating that people's freedoms are being taken away — that it's not just abortion rights, but also access to birth control. \"I really believe, a lot of people — especially Republican women — are going to vote for Kamala but maybe not tell their husbands,\" said Grisham, who called Trump and Vance \"short-sighted\" and \"misogynistic.\" Soon after Jan. 6, Grisham distanced herself from Trumpworld and eventually cooperated with the House committee that investigated the insurrection. In Oct. 2021, she told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that she tried to resign from the White House \"a couple of times\" but Melania Trump convinced her to stay. “In fact, I had a resignation letter written out with some very specific points in it that I was ready to hand over at any moment,” she said. “Jan. 6, of course, was my breaking point. And I was really proud that I was, well, the first in the administration to resign.”","summary":"Former Trump White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham on Tuesday evening disavowed her former boss and voiced support for Kamala Harris for president in remarks at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/former-trump-press-secretary-stephanie-grisham-endorses-harris-convent-rcna167476","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-08/240820-chicago-dnc-Stephanie-Grisham-ac-727p-014eae.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-21 00:08:23","author":"Rebecca Shabad","authors":["Rebecca Shabad"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.372},{"id":254553778,"title":"In the national spotlight, Illinois Democrats talk up abortion as 'fundamental' election issue","text":"With Illinois on the national stage this week, local Democrats Tuesday promoted the state’s status as an “oasis for reproductive freedom” as they use abortion as a key issue to drive voters to the polls. Tuesday’s theme on day two of the Democratic National Convention was “A Bold Vision for America’s Future.” “Not to discount the DNC, but I’d just like to point out that Illinois is already demonstrating what a bold progressive future looks like,” Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton said during the Illinois delegation’s daily breakfast at the Royal Sonesta hotel. “In Illinois, we trust women. And we are leading the nation in efforts to protect reproductive freedom.” Stratton called Illinois the “blueprint” for the battle over abortion rights, and called on party loyalists to help flip the U.S. House blue, increase the Senate majority, and elect Kamala Harris president to defeat Republican efforts to curtail access to abortion, birth control and in vitro fertilization. Under Democratic supermajorities in Illinois, the state has passed a slew of legal measures — both before and in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade in 2022 — from protections for out-of-state abortion seekers and providers, to a requirement that health insurance companies cover abortions without copays or deductibles. Women seeking abortions have flocked to Illinois — some 37,000 last year — with many of them coming from 14 states that have enacted abortion bans, according to the Chicago Abortion Fund, a nonprofit group that helps cover costs for women seeking the procedure. Megan Jeyifo, the organization’s executive director who spoke during Tuesday morning’s delegate breakfast, called Illinois “a beacon for access.” Illinois State Treasurer Michael Frerichs also spent most of his speech talking about reproductive issues, saying he ripped up his written remarks after watching four people tell their personal stories on stage during the convention Monday night. Frerichs credited in vitro fertilization with the birth of his two twin boys. During his first marriage, he said a doctor advised him and his then-wife to terminate a pregnancy at four months after an ultrasound detected anencephaly, a fatal birth defect. Two downstate hospitals didn’t allow abortion procedures, Frerichs said, so they relied on Planned Parenthood. Stratton equated the abortion issue with the economy in the coming election, calling it “fundamental.” “We’re here on the national stage because of exactly what we’ve done in Illinois,” she said. “We have protected reproductive freedom. We have become a safe heaven for women across the country.”","summary":"With Illinois on the national stage this week, local Democrats Tuesday promoted the state’s status as an “oasis for reproductive freedom” as they use abortion as a key issue to drive voters to the polls.","url":"https://www.dailyherald.com/20240820/news/in-the-national-spotlight-illinois-democrats-talk-up-abortion-as-fundamental-election-issue/","image":"https://imengine.public.prod.pdh.navigacloud.com/?uuid=3bd1a398-bf6f-509f-a448-8a09beeedd4b&function=fit&type=preview","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-21 00:08:09","author":"Christopher Placek","authors":["Christopher Placek"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.154},{"id":254553594,"title":"Rep.

Rick Scott wins Florida GOP primary as he seeks a second term","text":"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Rick Scott has won the Republican primary in Florida, advancing to a Nov. 5 showdown against the winner of the Democratic primary for a U.S. Senate seat. Scott — who won his 2018 race by a razor-thin margin of about 10,000 votes — has even larger ambitions as he looks to seek the Senate Republican leader seat if he wins the general election. An ally of former President Donald Trump, Scott sought the Senate leadership position in 2022 and lost by a 37-10 vote to U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell. This year, with McConnell stepping down, Scott could seek the position again Florida has shifted politically in the six years since Scott narrowly won office in 2018. At the time, Democrats outnumbered Republicans, but now Republicans have more than a 1 million-voter advantage over Democrats. Scott will face former U.S. Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell in a race that could largely hinge on the success of their parties’ presidential candidates. The former Miami congresswoman had the backing of party leaders as she defeated three other Democrats on the ballot. She now has to overcome Scott’s power of incumbency and his ability to self-fund his campaign. Mucarsel-Powell’s campaign has focused largely on abortion rights, gun safety and Latin American issues. This year, Florida also has amendments to protect abortion rights and legalize marijuana on the ballot, which have historically benefitted Democrats in elections. She will also be pinned on Vice President Kamala Harris inspiring Democrats to the polls as she faces former President Donald Trump. Mucarsel-Powell was the first Ecuadorian American and South American-born congressional member elected when she won in 2018, but she lost her reelection bid in 2020 to U.S. Rep. Carlos Gimenez. The Senate seat was not the only one in Florida to watch, since some of the state’s congressional races include the most well-known far-right lawmakers. One such example is U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz, who must defeat his primary challenger Aaron Dimmock. That race has been fueled by a barrage of campaign advertisements, with Gaetz accusing Dimmock of being a carpetbagger who moved from Missouri to the Florida Panhandle to promote diversity and inclusion. Meanwhile Dimmock has highlighted allegations of sexual misconduct against Gaetz. U.S. Reps. Byron Donalds and Mike Waltz are also widely known conservative legislators. Donalds didn’t have any primary challengers, and Waltz defeated John Grow, a software engineer. Waltz had spoken at former President Donald Trump’s campaign events, made Fox News appearances and appeared at the Republican National Convention last month. U.S. Rep. Cory Mills, who is also closely aligned with Trump and has staunchly defended Gaetz in the past, defended his seat against former Florida Senate candidate and veteran Mike Johnson. Each of these congressional members are far-right conservatives in Congress, known mostly for their alignment with Trump. They’ve led charges to defend the former president, stalled appropriations bills and budget deals, upended former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, and fought for stricter regulations on abortion access and immigration. Florida voters are deciding contested primaries in most of Florida’s 28 House districts. Among the higher-profile House races was in District 13, in Pinellas County along Florida’s Gulf Coast. Whitney Fox, a former marketing and communications director at the county transit authority, easily bested four Democratic opponents to take on GOP freshman Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, a member of the right-wing Freedom Caucus, who faced no primary opposition. The district leans Republican, but Fox expressed optimism she could prevail in November. “Our shared hopes for affordable housing, reproductive freedom, and an economy that works for everyone unite us far more than any differences divide us,” Fox said in an email. “This campaign is about putting power back in the hands of working families. It’s about ensuring that whether you’re a teacher, a small business owner, or a retiree, your voice matters.” Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The four-day vendor fair called “DemPalooza” is free and open to the public until Thursday. It includes training sessions, discussion panels and other programming as part of the Democratic National Convention. Small businesses were also on hand selling their wares and promoting their brand. Sip & Savor gave out free iced coffee samples from its pop-up cafe. The company operates five cafes in Chicago, including in Bronzeville, Hyde Park and the South Loop. “We’re more than just coffee. People love what we do,” Sip & Savor owner and CEO Trez Pugh III said. It offers financial literacy classes, mental health services and works with unhoused people, veterans and the disabled. “A lot of people knew about us already,” Pugh said. But being at DemPalooza gave him an opportunity to talk to people from Los Angeles, New York and Texas. Plus, there was the excitement of being at the DNC, where Vice President Kamala Harris is to be the first Black and South Asian woman to become the Democratic presidential candidate. “The last time I felt like this was when Obama did it,” Pugh said. “It’s electric.” Tonia Evans displayed copies of her children’s book, “The Purple Turtle,” along with toys and dolls, including one of Harris. “This is history in the making,” Evans said. “Just to be part of this moment is very heartfelt.” Angelique Chatman had sold about 25 of her handmade scented candles, which cost $15 to $30. Chatman founded Anjoli Candle Co. in 2020 from her home in Beverly after she was laid off from her accounting job. Since then her business has grown. She also found a full-time accounting position so now she has two jobs. Chatman, who displayed a Harris-inspired candle with a coconut scent called “Chucks and Pearls,” said the expo “is an amazing opportunity for us. We are able to get our products in front of people we wouldn’t get to sell to.” “We feel the energy and excitement,” she said of the convention, as music blasted through the expo hall. In addition to shopping, DemPalooza attendees can learn about grassroots organizing tools like the Reach mobile app and join polling briefings and skills-building workshops. The activities are part of efforts by the DNC to organize and reach voters. Thad Smith, founder and head beekeeper of Westside Bee Boyz, harvests and sells bee-made products like honey at farmers markets and community events on the West Side. Smith brought live bees to the DNC, and jovially spouted bee facts to everyone stopping by his booth. When asked how he ended up at the DNC, Smith said he wasn’t sure: “I guess the universe loves me.” He received an email invite that he believes came from a connection he made at a local farmers market. Vendor fair organizer Alex Sims-Jones, who owns the public relations firm APS & Associates in Chicago, said when she worked on Barack Obama’s campaign, staff couldn’t match the excitement on the streets. Vendors made unofficial T-shirts faster than the team could print the official merchandise. “That’s the sign of a good campaign — when you can’t keep up with the community,” Jones said. The businesses included in the expo extend far beyond T-shirts. The majority don’t advertise any sort of direct connection or official political affiliation. Smith said he’s not political. “I don’t care if you’re a Republican or Democrat,” he said. Smith said he ultimately agreed to the invite because of the exposure to himself and his business. “I’m a Black beekeeper,” Smith said. “There are people in this country that don’t even know we freaking exist.” Expecting crowds Designer Peter Gaona sold about 60 pins depicting Harris in bright pink and green hues for $16. The shades reflect the official colors of Harris’ sorority, the Alpha Kappa Alpha, which is among a group of historically Black sororities and fraternities commonly known as the “Divine Nine.” Gaona, owner of accessory and decor company Reformed School in Bronzeville, also displayed greeting cards, shirts, sweaters and pillows with striking silhouettes. The possibility of Harris being the first Black female president is inspiring, Gaona said. “She is saying to girls and women to make their voices heard and maybe one day they will throw their hat in the ring as well.” Graphic designer Imanuel Basley was busy printing T-shirts with images of Harris for a long queue of customers. Basley, owner of The Print Lounge in Pilsen, sold nearly 100 T-shirts, at $25 each, and expects Thursday to be “super busy.” The expo, which started Monday, allowed people from across the country to peruse Chicago-made products. Kathy Jensen, 71, drove eight hours from Nebraska to Chicago to attend the convention. The retired teacher from a rural town with a population of 740 said being at the DNC is “wonderful, so powerful. I’m not as depressed as I was.” Lacey Merica, a delegate from Omaha, said she was “excited as a younger adult to see the new generation stepping up and running for office.” Merica, 41, showed off friendship bracelets that covered her wrist. The expo included a space to make friendship bracelets, get a Kamala Harris-inspired manicure, listen to a podcast recording and watch performances. DemPalooza will be open from 9:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. through Thursday at McCormick Place. The entrance is near 24th Street and Indiana Avenue.

Critics of President Biden had long suggested he wasn’t mentally fit to serve another term, but he sought re-election until Democratic leaders effectively forced him to step aside following a disastrous debate performance against former President Trump. Throughout the entire process, Biden and White House officials have insisted he was still sharp. In a piece that largely fawned over Biden, the editorial board declared his \"willingness to surrender power deserves special recognition\" and added a tidbit that White House critics have long suspected. Four paragraphs into the piece, the Post editorial board conceded: \"The 81-year-old had shown signs of slipping for a long time, but his inner circle worked to conceal his decline.\" 30 DAYS: KAMALA HARRIS HAS NOT HELD A PRESS CONFERENCE SINCE EMERGING AS PRESUMPTIVE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE \"He and the country would have been better off if Mr. Biden had kept his implied promise from the 2020 campaign to be a ‘transitional’ figure, perhaps by bowing out after the Democrats’ surprisingly good showing in the 2022 midterm elections,\" the editorial board added. The Post even linked to the infamous Wall Street Journal report about Biden showing signs of slipping behind closed doors, which was largely dismissed by the mainstream media until the disastrous debate put fitness for office at the forefront. The White House also exploded over the report and pressed Democrats to work the newspaper's reporters and insist on the president's mental fitness. Left-wing Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin, a fanatic Biden and Democratic supporter, even fumed on June 9 that the Wall Street Journal article was \"shoddy\" and the president was still perfectly fit to lead; six weeks later, he was out of the race. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital. Washington Post senior reporter Aaron Blake wrote prior to the debate debacle that the WSJ piece \"set off a new round of teeth-gnashing about coverage of President Biden’s age,\" and said Democrats have asked why Trump doesn’t face the same criticism for his advanced age. BIDEN COMMITTED ‘IMPEACHABLE CONDUCT,’ ‘DEFRAUDED UNITED STATES TO ENRICH HIS FAMILY’: HOUSE GOP REPORT Following the debate, the mainstream media and high-profile Democrats quickly turned on Biden, with many openly calling for him to step aside. Conservatives watched as the same people who dismissed concerns before the debate suddenly wanted a new candidate to face Trump. Once Biden ended his re-election bid, the Democratic Party quickly consolidated support behind Vice President Kamala Harris to replace him on the ticket.

Fain spoke with a small group of reporters on the sidelines of the Democratic National Convention (DNC) on Tuesday, the day after he gave an impassioned speech calling former President Trump a \"scab\" and advocating strongly for Harris's victory. Meanwhile O'Brien told Fox News' Neil Cavuto in a televised interview on Tuesday that he has not yet heard from Democrats about his request to speak at the convention. Fox News Digital asked Fain what he thought of the snub, and of O'Brien's decision to speak at Trump's convention last month — the first union boss in the RNC's 121-year history to do so. UNION LEADER'S PROVOCATIVE RNC SPEECH DRAWS IRE FROM SOME IN ORGANIZED LABOR Fain stayed mum about his thoughts on Harris and Democrats ignoring O'Brien but said he did not fault the Teamsters leader on his decision — but said he did not see any use in doing so himself. \"Sean O'Brien has his reasons for doing what he's doing. I mean, you know, I think what he said is genuine, that he has members that he knows are going to vote that way. And you know, he's reaching out to both parties, I just — we have a difference in philosophy on that,\" Fain said. \"I mean, if the Republican Party gave me a reason to believe they cared about workers, we would, you know, entertain things like that.

I want our members to understand there's not any doubt where we stand in this election.\" Fain added that \"we don't tell people how to vote,\" but \"it's our job to put the facts in front of you and give you the proper information about what's best for labor.\" And Fain did make it clear where he stood during his Monday night speech, rousing the supportive crowd into chants calling Trump a \"scab.\" A UAW spokesperson told Fox News Digital that the union has sold \"thousands\" of shirts with the phrase since Fain's remarks.

In an exclusive roundtable interview for EW's Awardist in celebration of Drag Race's 10 franchise nods at the 2024 Emmys, season 16 finalists Plane Jane, Sapphira Cristál, and winner Nymphia Wind reunite to reflect on what made their recent batch of episodes some of the most entertaining reality TV of the year. But, they also discuss why they feel the show's Main Stage isn't simply a performance space meant to showcase their art, but rather a platform for the queer community at large amid the rise of anti-LGBTQ+ politics. “We, as queer people, have always been at the forefront of change,\" says Sapphira. Adding more fuel to the significance of its current Emmys campaign is a presidential election year in the United States, and it's clear that the Drag Race fandom includes powerful politicians, too. In July, following months of proposed legislation targeting drag artists and trans people, Vice President Kamala Harris made history as the first sitting VP to enter the Werk Room when she made an appearance on the All Stars 9 finale, weeks after she invited Nymphia to perform at the annual Pride in Washington, D.C. — the same event Harris enlisted season 15 winner Sasha Colby to emcee last year. Shortly after taking the crown, Nymphia also traveled to her home region of Taiwan to perform for Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen. Colby, a Hawaiian-born performer, also received special praise from Rep. Jill Tokuda at the House of Representatives after her win. These leaders' investment in the franchise represents a wave of support from political powerhouses that the contestants say they can feel. \"They start to realize there is a change coming, and we’ve definitely been at the top of it as Drag Race started to sweep everything,\" Sapphira says. \"And once you see that people are taking space — they’re not being given the space, we’re taking the space and letting people know we are here because we deserve to be — when you see that, you have two options: fight against it, like those other people are doing, or you can say, 'Yep, you know what, we’re with it, too!'\" \"That's exactly what the president of Taiwan and Kamala Harris are doing;\" she continues. \"They’re saying, we’re with this, we’re trying to grow and move forward. We can’t go back, we have to go forward. Queer people have always taken us forward.\" Nymphia says she feels that their season proudly carries that torch for the community, as she singles out the cast's musical performance of the original inspirational anthem \"Power\" as a highlight of the season, both for drag excellence and important messaging that's relatable across demographics. When it comes to appeal, the season 16 winner also doesn't think it's that complicated; good drag is good drag, and people like Harris can simply be fans of great art, while at the same time recognizing the power wielded by the demographic behind it. \"I feel like drag queens represent expression of the self and trying to be themselves despite the pushback of people telling you that you’re wrong or doing something disgusting. Despite all of that, we fight so hard to be our true selves,\" Nymphia observes. \"It’s important for leaders to connect with these kind of people to show more openness in their leadership and they support these people who are marginalized for so long.\" Sign up for Entertainment Weekly's free daily newsletter to get breaking TV news, exclusive first looks, recaps, reviews, interviews with your favorite stars, and more. As Drag Race prepares to compete for each of its 10 Emmy nominations, Sapphira sums up the admittedly light contest in powerful terms, in response to a question about the significance of the industry lifting up a queer-led, queer-made, queer-appealing series: \"It’s important and necessary for those who are not being oppressed, to lift up those who are.\" Tune in to the 2024 Emmys broadcast on Sept. 15 to find out how RuPaul's Drag Race fares this year.

We’re told Cassidy, whose “Pass the Mic” concert series became a hit during the pandemic, has curated music to represent each state. A source familiar with tonight’s convention told us Cassidy’s selection will be songs specific to the location, but will stick to the theme of Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign, “freedom, unity, hope, the future and believing in each other,” our insider shared. California delegates will nominate Harris to the tunes of “California Love” by the late rapper Tupac Shakur. New York’s song will be “Empire State of Mind” by Jay-Z and Alicia Keys. And for Texas, Cassidy will, of course, play a song by Houston born and raised child of Destiny, Beyonce Knowles-Carter, whose song “Freedom” is the theme track to Harris’ campaign. Texas delegates, however, won’t be nominating Harris to “Freedom,” Cassidy will play Beyonce’s country tune, “Texas Hold ‘Em,” instead.

Mark Kelly responds to question on serving in potential Harris Cabinet","text":"EXCLUSIVE: Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., responded to a question about his level of interest in a Cabinet-level role in a potential Kamala Harris administration. After speaking at the Veterans and Military Families Council meeting during the Democratic National Convention on Tuesday, Kelly joined Fox News Digital for an interview about the presidential race. The Arizona senator was asked by Fox News Digital if he would be interested in serving in Vice President Kamala Harris' cabinet if she won the presidential election in November, specifically in secretary positions in the Departments of Defense (DOD) or Homeland Security (DHS). GOP SENATORS KICK OFF TRUMP CAMPAIGN DNC COUNTER-PROGRAMMING: HARRIS 'DOESN'T HAVE A CLUE' \"I'm focused on doing everything I possibly can over the next 77 days to make sure that Tim Walz and Kamala Harris are successful on November 5th. That's my goal,\" he said, not indicating whether he'd want to join their administration. Kelly's answer was similar to his responses earlier this month when he was being considered and vetted as a potential running mate for Harris. He repeatedly told reporters that it wasn't about him, and he was focused on making sure Democrats win in November. STRATEGISTS PIN GOP SENATE HOPES ON TRUMP BASE COMING 'HOME' AHEAD OF ELECTION The Democratic senator's background as a 25-year Navy combat veteran puts him at a unique vantage point and makes him a very likely contender for a potential stint as the secretary of defense if he were interested. Similarly, Kelly's role as senator of a border state, who has made clear his concerns regarding illegal immigration, could leverage his standing on a list of possible DHS secretaries. One sticking point for the Arizona Democrat in the 2024 election is respect for veterans and their families. \"Do you expect somebody, Donald Trump to really care about military families when he doesn't even care about the service members that have put their lives on the line and regard them as suckers and losers?\" he asked on Tuesday. \"Of course you wouldn't.\" DEM SOCIALIST SENATOR RALLIES BEHIND HARRIS' PRICE-FIXING PLAN: 'IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD' However, former President Trump has denied the anonymously sourced report that said he called deceased soldiers \"suckers\" and \"losers.\" He has denied doing so, writing on Truth Social, \"Only a sicko with an axe to grind would suggest that anyone would make such a statement.\" But his denial hasn't stopped opponents, Kelly and President Biden included, from holding it against him. \"You need somebody who cares about our veterans and cares about our service members,\" Kelly told Fox News Digital. DEM-ALIGNED GROUP HAMMERS HARRIS' FORMER VP SHORTLISTER FOR TURNING 'HIS BACK' ON BLACK STUDENTS According to the senator, \"a President Harris will make sure that we continue to modernize our military, to make sure our service members can win in conflicts, whether it's in the Western Pacific, in Europe, in the Middle East, anywhere.\" He further described the \"tremendous amount of energy\" at the DNC, where Harris is being celebrated as the new Democratic nominee for president after Biden suspended his campaign. But Kelly said the enthusiasm isn't confined to Chicago. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Arizona is often thought of as sort of a red state,\" he explained.

The South Side, Chicago-hailing rapper energized the crowd of Night 2 at the convention center, performing his 2024 track “Fortunate,” adapting his lyrics to incorporate a message about Vice President Kamala Harris and being assisted on the chorus by gospel singer Jonathan McReynolds. “I thank God for this moment in time where Kamala Harris will change the world for the better with love, hope and grace,” the rapper-activist declared. The Grammy and Academy Award-winning rap star is no stranger to the Democratic party or the White House.

The biggest reason protesters have turned out: the war in Gaza. While the Democratic Party formally embraces a two-state solution, according to the party platform released this week, progressive elements within the party have long expressed frustration with President Joe Biden over the issue, claiming he hasn’t sufficiently pressured Israel to cease the attacks it has leveled on Gaza in the 10 months since the Oct. 7 attack. Trump, meanwhile, has issued many notable criticisms of Hamas. He said last week that if he is elected he would “deport pro-Hamas radicals,” and he has encouraged Israel to “finish the problem” in eliminating Hamas. Vice President Kamala Harris has expressed support for a cease-fire, while Trump hasn’t. Still, Republicans didn’t face the same ire at their convention, and the reason protesters in Chicago said they showed up here, instead, is to hold the party currently in power accountable. Protesters said they were more enthusiastic about showing up at the Democratic convention, which kicked off Monday, for a variety of reasons. Most prominently, they include the progressive protesters’ belief that they may have a far more viable path to persuading a Harris-led ticket to enact meaningful policy change over the war in Gaza. But many also said they’re angry with Democrats because they believe that as the incumbent party, they hold more responsibility for the war than Republicans right now. “I want to push the Democratic Party on a lot of issues,” said Jacob Smith, 32, a software engineer who traveled from Detroit and attended Monday afternoon’s protest, at which several thousand people marched. He listed “stopping the genocide in Gaza” and achieving a “permanent cease-fire” as chief among them. He said he felt both parties were “equally beholden to special and corporate interests.” “They’re both basically right-wing parties at this point,” he said, adding, “But in general Democrats are a little better than Republicans.” Smith said he hasn’t decided whom he wants to vote for yet, and he wouldn’t offer whom he’s considering, other than that it “won’t be Trump.” Smith said he felt it was more important to protest the Biden-Harris administration because “it’s the administration that has aided and abetted an ongoing, visible genocide.” “The country is run by Democrats right now. This is happening on their watch,” he said. Smith said he was hopeful that Democratic Party leaders would be more likely to listen to such protest efforts “because progressive voters are part of their base — maybe they’ll be more likely to listen to us” than Republicans. Smith didn’t attend any of the far smaller protests at the RNC. “Obviously, protesting Republican policies is a good thing,” he said, “but how much of a policy change is it really realistic to expect would happen that way.” “It’s about efficacy in a lot of ways,” Smith added. “Where are your actions going to be most effective?” Lauren Pineiro, 24, a restaurant worker from Florida, also joined the smaller protests at the Republican convention. “I was happy to protest against Trump and the racist reactionary agenda of that party. But I think the reason why it was smaller is just because the Democrats are in power right now, and they’re the ones that have been overseeing this genocide,” she said. “I think that’s why people feel more strongly to come here, even though a lot of people do care about fighting back against Trump’s agenda.” Fred Schein, 76, a lifelong Chicago resident, said, “Trump is a fascist, and I would never vote for him, but the Democrats are the ones in power during this war.” He said that while this year’s protests are centered on the war in Gaza, “they also are really wrapping in quite a lot of issues,” he said, listing reproductive rights, climate change and immigrant rights as a few examples. Annie Weiler, 28, a marketing manager from Knoxville, Tennessee, said she hoped the protest effort would help guide the Harris campaign to pivot not just on tone but also on policy when it comes to the war in Gaza. “Right now, Kamala Harris still has the option to help stop funding this war,” she said. “I am a Democrat, but it is hard to support Kamala Harris when she is openly supporting Israel in this conflict,” Weiler added. Sean Parmelee, 36, marched Monday with a sign that read, “We’re trying to help you, Kamala.” He means it earnestly. “I’m voting for her — but many people here are not,” said Parmelee, a Chicago resident. “Honestly, she is making it very hard for them.” “Look at all this energy. She can have it all if she chooses,” he said. Parmelee said he’s protesting because pushing for a cease-fire and an arms embargo on Israel “is the right thing to do.” “And it’s the right strategy for Kamala Harris,” he said. As Parmelee spoke, a protest organizer wielding a megaphone led the crowd in a loud chant of “Harris, Harris, what do you say, how many kids have you killed today?” Sydney Loving, 29, a teacher from Dallas, said she was protesting now at the Democrats’ convention instead of at the Republicans’ last month because she sees the Biden administration as “the architects of the genocide in Gaza.” “It’s just that simple fact — they’re the ones who are in office, writing the checks, who are sending the missiles and all this stuff,” Loving said. Mariana Espana, 17, a student in Chicago who will be old enough to vote by Election Day, said she was here to help push Harris specifically to “act on a cease-fire for Palestine” because “it’s such a tragedy to see these kids dying.” “I personally support Kamala. A Trump presidency would be a disaster. But I feel it’s important to push Kamala to push for a cease-fire,” she said. “I think it would help her campaign, because it would help rally this wing of the party,” she said.","summary":"CHICAGO — The protests outside the Democratic National Convention, entering its second day, have already far outnumbered the demonstrations in Milwaukee a month ago, when former President Donald Trump accepted his party’s presidential nomination at the Republican National Convention.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/protesters-dnc-far-outnumbered-republicans-convention-rcna167232","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-08/240819-DNC-2024-protest-wm-351p-b79da3.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-20 23:48:03","author":"Adam Edelman,Alex Tabet,Daniella Silva","authors":["Adam Edelman","Alex Tabet","Daniella Silva"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.132},{"id":254552454,"title":"DNC 2024: Who Is Angela Alsobrooks?

The time slot Alsobrooks was given speaks to the importance DNC organizers give her remarks and the parallels between the historic nature of her race and Harris'.In May, the 53-year-old won the Democratic primary over Representative David Trone. Trone spent $60 million on the primary, making it the most expensive primary election in the state's history.While history is on the Democrats' side in the election since Republicans haven't won a Senate seat in Maryland in over 40 years, Hogan is a formidable opponent. Hogan left office in 2023 with a 77 percent approval rating, making him one of the most popular governors in the country. His popularity was bipartisan, with an 81 percent approval rating with Democrats, according to a Gonzales Research and Media Services poll in January 2023.A June poll, however, shows the race between Hogan and Alsobrooks is much tighter than many people expected. A poll of 635 Maryland voters from Public Policy Polling found Alsobrooks is leading the Maryland Senate race 45 percent to 34 percent.\"The fight ahead will not be easy,\" Alsobrooks said after winning the primary. \"Maryland has been a blue state, but it will only stay a blue state if we put in the work. Because Larry Hogan, his BFF Mitch McConnell, and Donald Trump's Republican Party want to flip this seat.\"According to her biography, Alsobrooks is the first woman to be elected as Prince George's County Executive. She began her professional career in 1997 as Prince George's County Assistant State's Attorney and became the first full-time prosecutor assigned to handle domestic violence cases.In 2010, she became the youngest person and first woman elected to serve as the County's State Attorney.Alsobrooks graduated from Duke University with a Bachelor's Degree in Public Policy and received her law degree from the University of Maryland. She's also a Delta Sigma Theta Sorority member and has one daughter named Alex.When Harris learned that Alsobrooks won her election in 2010 after running a campaign on policies Harris deployed in San Francisco, the future vice president called to congratulate her, according to The Washington Post. Over the years, Harris and Alsobrooks have helped each other with their campaigns. In June, Alsobrooks appeared at a campaign event with Harris, President Joe Biden and Maryland Governor Wes Moore.\"Their relationship that they already have established lends to the excitement that we have in our state,\" Karen Darkes, the executive director of the Maryland Democratic Party, told CNN.","summary":"Angela Alsobrooks will speak about her 14-year friendship with Vice President Kamala Harris on Tuesday night at the DNC.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/angela-alsobrooks-dnc-2024-speaker-kamala-harris-1942132","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2454357/who-angela-alsobrooks-dnc-2024.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-20 23:47:18","author":"Jenni Fink","authors":["Jenni Fink"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.35},{"id":254552352,"title":"Executive Presence In Elections: A Lesson For Business Leaders","text":"Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Business leaders can study the executive presence of presidential candidates for lessons on how to ... [+] cultivate it in their own arena. getty In my speaker training workshops, I frequently get questions about executive presence. What is it, how to improve it, why it’s important in the first place. A lack of executive presence is frequently cited as the reason a worker is being held back from a promotion or overlooked for important projects. And feedback about executive presence is surprisingly lacking in actionable detail. Perhaps not for much longer. Communicating executive presence involves a distinct set of skills, but the measurable characteristics of executive presence are still evolving. Sylvia Ann Hewlett, author of Executive Presence: The Missing Link Between Merit and Success has been around for a decade and focused on gravitas, communication and appearance. Enter Scott Hutcheson, a senior lecturer at Purdue University and owner of a training and consulting business centered on leadership. He has worked with 4,000 leaders in 147 countries. Hutcheson cultivated an interest in executive presence over the course of his 40-year career in leadership training – “before it had a name,” he said. He set out to look at whether executive presence matters in the highest of high-stakes contests: the United States presidential election. This work will be featured in an upcoming book about executive presence. “After several conversations about who is ‘presidential’ and who isn’t, I decided to conduct research,” said Hutcheson. “I found the results fascinating and others seemed to find them quite interesting as well.” MORE FOR YOU Netflix’s Best New Movie Arrives With A Perfect 100% Critic Score ‘Emily In Paris’ Dethroned In Netflix’s Top 10 List By A New Show How Dallas Cowboys Owner Jerry Jones Accidentally Bought Into An Alleged $100 Million Mississippi Cancer Cluster Hutcheson created a model based on three traits, each with six behaviors. The 18-behavior framework was statistically validated by Dutch partner company Human Insight. They include: Warmth: Active listening and connecting with others on a personal level, which helps leaders build trust and foster a positive, engaging environment. Competence: Setting the right priorities and being well prepared, which helps leaders demonstrate expertise and reliability. Gravitas: Maintaining composure under pressure and delivering messages effectively, which are crucial for commanding respect and inspiring confidence. Hutcheson and his team of Ph.D. students used GenAI tools to analyze information about presidential candidates. Each candidate was given a score based on the model, then examined the election results. Bottom Line: Executive Presence Wins Elections Since 1960, the first election with televised debates, in every U.S. presidential election except one (Bush/Kerry), the candidate with a higher executive presence score won the popular vote. In two elections (Bush/Gore and Hilary Clinton/Trump), the candidate with the higher executive presence score won the popular vote but did not win the electoral college. Here are the top executive presence scores among candidates based on the Hutcheson model and GenAI analysis: Barack Obama (95) John F. Kennedy (92.5) Ronald Reagan (92.5) Kamala Harris (92.5) Bill Clinton (90) In an exchange about the current presidential candidates, Hutcheson points out that Harris’s background as a prosecutor has likely contributed to her ability to project confidence and maintain composure, key parts of gravitas, and her ability to connect with people supports warmth, while her lengthy government experience indicates competence. Although Donald Trump did not score high on executive presence (at a score of 62.5), he demonstrates “a unique ability to connect with a large and loyal base through his unfiltered communication style, which many perceive as authentic and relatable,” said Hutcheson. The Lesson for Leaders Business leaders who dismiss the importance of executive presence do so at their peril, because leaders must constantly win the “votes” of employees, shareholders and other stakeholders. Hutcheson stresses that executive presence isn’t something that’s achieved overnight. “It’s a continuous process of growth and refinement. With deliberate effort, any leader can elevate their presence and influence,” he said. Hutcheson has actionable recommendations that leaders should prioritize to build a stronger executive presence. Warmth: Develop an ability to connect with others by improving listening skills and showing genuine interest in people. Competence: Sharpen your expertise and be prepared. This will build your credibility and ensure that others see you as a reliable authority. Gravitas: Work on maintaining composure, especially under pressure, and communicate your ideas with clarity and conviction. I’ll add that an organization’s culture will determine which characteristics are most valued, and therefore most rewarded. My own recommendation is to take stock of the behaviors you observe in successful leaders and determine how to showcase your own best traits without feeling like you need to mimic a leader you admire.

Madison. But alas, Tuesday afternoon, none of the DNC hoopla had made the trip down Madison to her stand. No delegates — or candidates — are taking advantage of the turkey tips, smothered cabbage and other dishes she cookes fresh at home and keeps warm inside the grill. “I guess I’m too far down,” she says, but issues an invitation anyway: “Kamala Harris, come look for your girl, Vicki Victoria Davis!” Cooking for four years now, Davis streams her process on TikTok as @shortyruff3 — but aspires to have her own restaurant instead of this pop-up outfit. But, she says amid her kids and grandkids who’ve joined her, “I need some funds.” Organizers of the DNC promised that the West Side would benefit from hosting the convention that’s already drawn tens of thousands of conventioneers, protesters and dignitaries to Chicago. That’s not been Davis’ experience. Her work days have lengthened these last few years as people seem to have less money for takeout. She doubts she’ll catch any of the speech Tuesday night by Chicago-born former first lady Michelle Obama. “I’m out here to make a living,” she says. “I’ll catch up on the rest later.” Madison, historically a Black Main Street, still bustles with Chicagoans earning their way. Even at an underpass in the 4600 block where signs advise that IT IS UNLAWFUL TO SOLICIT FOR PROSTITUTION IN ANY PUBLIC PLACE. Here, artist Blake Lenoir sprays the foliage on a mural of roses commissioned as a love letter to the area. The flowers he’s painting around snippets of beautiful faces are meant to remind men to respect women and for women to respect themselves, he says. And for the area’s history of selling and buying sex to be documented, especially as gentrification inches westward from the Loop, past the United Center in a move many say started ahead of the 1996 DNC, when then-Mayor Richard M. Daley cleared out Skid Row. For Lenoir, 33, a father and new homeowner in Beverly, the upcoming election to vote in a Black woman as the country’s first woman commander-in-chief should bode well for peace — particularly he points to Gaza and Kenya — better than 250 years of male leaders have done. And as a muralist around the West Side, he says, his livelihood flourishes under folks who value the arts and issue grants for public works. None of that is included in the radically conservative Republican platform known as Project 2025. “This election is about ‘out with the old,’ literally,” Lenoir says. “We have to get a sound mind in office.” Not that any of the politicians are listening, says Macy Robinson Jr., a 79-year-old seller of watermelons whose roadside business in Austin includes responding to drive-by hollers: “ARKANSAS OR MISSISSIPPI?” The answer is Midnight, Mississippi, the Delta hometown of Robinson until, as a teenager, he migrated north like so many other West Siders to Chicago. DNC or no DNC, the prices are still $12 a watermelon, $3 a cantaloupe. He and his partner don’t see anything for themselves in the convention four miles away. Politicians never tell the truth, Robinson says, especially not to “poor folks” like him. He’ll vote for the Democrat anyway. “They do what they want to do,” the businessman says. “Lying before we got here, lying after we leave.” “I’ve been here for 60 years. I’ve still got to hustle.” MacArthur’s Restaurant, 5412 W. Madison, or 15 minutes west of the United Center as the cab rides, bulked up the cooking staff this week in anticipation that lunch lines might snake past all the framed politician photos and run out the door. No official DNC catering had been ordered. “We had some volunteers from the DNC eating here but we’d like to see those speaking for us show up too,” says manager and area pastor, Maurice Gaiter Catering slips were stacking up for watch parties Tuesday night for the Obamas and Thursday for Kamala Harris, and staff dished out chicken and turkey legs, with generous sides and desserts to a steady stream of customers. With so much at stake this election, Harris’ nomination has been a boon for Democrats, among Black voters and women. “I think the enthusiasm we have for the party is going to propel us to the White House.” But, as he stresses on the big show’s second day on the West Side, “let’s not forget those outside the walls of the DNC.”","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2024-democratic-national-convention/2024/08/20/how-west-side-workers-along-madison-are-feeling-in-the-shadow-of-the-dnc","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/185f1da/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1964x1121+0+170/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc5%2Fe4%2F7f2efe5544d09c79fa0c9eb529c7%2Fscre","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-20 23:43:44","author":"Lauren Fitzpatrick","authors":["Lauren Fitzpatrick"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.306},{"id":254552292,"title":"Kamala Harris Raises $500 Million in One Month as Enthusiasm Grows: Report","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris has reportedly raised a staggering $500 million for her presidential campaign less than one month after entering the race.Harris has been riding a wave of Democratic enthusiasm since President Joe Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed her on July 21, achieving a record-breaking fundraising haul that included an unprecedented $81 million in donations during the first 24 hours of her candidacy.Fundraising for the Harris campaign, now with the addition of running mate Tim Walz, appears to be continuing at a dizzying pace while this year's Democratic National Convention (DNC) takes place in Chicago.By Tuesday, just four weeks into her campaign, Harris had taken in around $500 million, according to a report from Reuters that cites four anonymous sources \"familiar with the fundraising effort.\"Newsweek reached out for comment to the Harris-Walz campaign via email on Tuesday evening.Of the reported $500 million, $200 million was raised during the first week of her campaign, with a total of $310 million raised in July.

SO famous that Coronation Street called a character after her – 'they had my blessing for that' – upcoming Strictly contestant Toyah Willcox, 66, pictured, was asked in Uncut magazine if it was true that she once slept in a coffin. She replied: 'I tried. We lived opposite a funeral parlour, and we got on very well with them. They also had a morgue for people who'd just died.

Kennedy’s grandson, Jack Schlossberg, compared Kamala Harris to his late grandfather in a brief speech before the Democratic National Convention Tuesday evening. “Tonight, JFK’s call to action is now ours to answer, because once again, the torch has been passed to a new generation, to a leader who shares my grandfather's energy, vision, and optimism for our future,” he said. “That leader is Vice President Kamala Harris.” Back in 2020, Schlossberg spoke alongside his mom, Caroline Kennedy, at the party’s virtual convention. This year, he had a live, in-person spot in the line-up all to himself. He spoke right after former President Jimmy Carter’s grandson. Schlossberg showed his chiseled face around the convention hall Monday night, with multiple reporters snapping pictures of the 31-year-old on the arena floor. Political heavyweights like Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi got in on the action, with the latter appearing in a photo that had echoes of one she took with his grandfather half a century before. The Kennedy heir has been openly critical of his cousin, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., for trumpeting unfounded and unorthodox proposals in his long-shot bid for the White House. Schlossberg recently got a new gig at Vogue, where he was named a political correspondent last month. But while he’s being paid about as well as the average reporter—reportedly just $250 per article—he’s gotten unusual leeway in making his political views public. In a recent Instagram post, he referred to President Joe Biden as his “hero.” In another, he shared that he was a New York DNC delegate voting for Kamala Harris. He could also be seen along the sidelines of Harris and Tim Walz’s kickoff rally in Philadelphia earlier this month, where he stood among campaign officials and fans—not the press. Still, he’s lasted longer at Vogue than his grandmother, Jackie. She allegedly quit her Vogue gig on day one because the magazine was staffed by so many women she feared she may not meet a husband there.","summary":"Mike SegarChicago, Illinois — John F.

Attorneys for two Democratic activists challenging Kennedy’s spot on the ballot said in a Harrisburg courtroom on Tuesday that Kennedy’s candidacy paperwork has a fake home address. Similar allegations are being heard in other state courts. They also argued that the third-party candidate hasn’t gathered the required number of signatures. Citing a canceled flight from Boston to Philadelphia the evening before, Kennedy showed up an hour and 40 minutes late. Commonwealth Court Judge Lori Dumas had earlier decided to continue without his testimony. Just after his arrival, the hearing was adjourned without the judge indicating when she would rule on the matter. Kennedy could snag votes from Vice President Kamala Harris or former president Donald Trump if he were to appear on the ballot in Pennsylvania, a critical battleground with 19 electoral votes. Trump won the state in 2016 but President Joe Biden won it back in 2020. The attorney for Kennedy slammed the judge’s move to continue without the candidate’s testimony. Kennedy claimed that the Democrats are trying to block the rights of tens of millions of voters. “To me, it’s a sad devolution of this party that the only way that they can win elections is to keep its opponents off the debating stage, off the ballots, and use lawfare to try to win elections rather than campaigning,” he said outside the courthouse. “I’ll be on the ballot in every state,” he added. The Kennedy campaign has called the challenge “frivolous” and Kennedy lawyer Paul Rossi said that a state shouldn’t be in the business of banning a candidate from its ballot because of a residency argument. He said that it would lead to a “patchwork” of state court rulings removing some candidates from ballots, citing the March Supreme Court ruling to reinstate Trump on primary ballots following state attempts to use the 14th Amendment to have him removed. Rossi added that a federal court ruling from 2016 which ordered a lowering of the signature requirements for candidates from smaller parties should also be used in Kennedy’s case. One of the attorneys for the activists challenging Kennedy’s presence on the ballot, Tim Ford, said that Kennedy had filed petitions that violated state law and that his late appearance “shows a total disregard for our process here in Pennsylvania and a disrespect for the voters who have to make the decision of who they’re going to vote for for president.” Ford argued that Kennedy hasn’t shown that the signature ruling should apply in this case and that the “patchwork” argument references a federal constitutional case and cannot be used in a case where the state of Pennsylvania is setting the rules governing who can appear on its ballots. Kennedy is battling challenges in other states as well, including Georgia and New York. Last week, a New York judge rejected his nominating petitions because the listed address was a “sham.” Kennedy is appealing the decision. Kennedy has listed his address as being in the Empire State, but those challenging his presence on the ballot say that he really lives in Los Angeles, California. Rossi argued that Kennedy partly pointed to the New York address to adhere to the 12th Amendment which states that a president and vice president shouldn’t be from the same state – Kennedy’s running mate Nicole Shanahan is a Californian. The attorney said that Kennedy is registered to vote in New York and that he’s set to return to live in the state. The Kennedy campaign has claimed to have collected the required signatures to appear on the ballots in all 50 states and that he’s currently officially on the ballot in 22 of them, including key states like North Carolina and Michigan.

Stephanie Grisham, who held the role from July 2019 to April 2020, is one of several Republican figures invited to the convention in Chicago to denounce the “extremism” of the former president and his campaign. During her remarks, she told attendees that the former president mocks his supporters behind closed doors, calling them “basement dwellers.” “I wasn't just a Trump supporter. I was a true believer,” Grisham said, before adding that during a hospital visit “when people were dying in the ICU, he was mad that the cameras were not watching him. He has no empathy, no morals, and no fidelity to the truth.” “He used to tell me, ‘it doesn't matter what you say, Stephanie, say it enough and people will believe you,’” the former press secretary said. She added that she resigned on January 6, 2021, because she “couldn't be part of the insanity any longer.” “Kamala Harris tells the truth, she repsects the American people and she has my vote,” she said. In a statement to NBC News, Grisham said she never thought she would be speaking at a Democratic convention. “But, after seeing firsthand who Donald Trump really is, and the threat he poses to our country, I feel very strongly about speaking out.” She added: “While I don’t agree with Vice President Harris on everything, I am proud to be supporting her because I know she will defend our freedoms and represent our nation with honesty and integrity.” Other Republicans are expected to share a similar message throughout the convention, including former Representative Adam Kinzinger, of Illinois, who is scheduled to speak Thursday. On Monday – the first night of the convention – a video compilation of former Trump voters was played to attendees, including a longer interview with a former Trumper, Rich Logis. “While Donald Trump continues to attack moderates and independents, the Harris-Walz campaign has made clear that there is a place in our coalition for voters who reject the extremism of Donald Trump and want to protect our democracy,” a Harris campaign official said. Grisham was Trump’s third White House press secretary, succeeding Sarah Huckabee Sanders and was the first White House Press Secretary to hold no press conferences. She later assumed the role of chief of staff to former first lady Melania Trump on April 7 2020. On the evening of January 6 2021, Grisham resigned from the position following the storming of the United States Capitol. In the aftermath of the insurrection and her resignation Grisham has become a fervent critic of her former boss, warning that he would “seek revenge” if not reelected. She told CNN earlier this year: “He used to tell me when I was press secretary, ‘Go out there and say this.’ And if it was false, he would say, ‘It doesn’t matter, Stephanie. Just say it over and over and over again, people will believe it.’ “He knows his base believes in him. He knows he can basically say anything and his base will believe what he’s saying.” Her inclusion on the second night of the convention, which also includes remarks from Barack Obama, Michelle Obama, and second gentleman Doug Emhoff, continues the Harris campaign’s drive to recruit Republicans to their cause. “We will be putting patriotic Republicans front and center in our convention programming to explain, in their own words, why they are putting country first and supporting Vice President Harris,” Austin Weatherford, the campaign’s national Republican engagement director, said in a statement to NBC News. The campaign launched its “Republicans for Harris” program this month to reach more moderate and independent voters who may have supported Trump in the past, specifically highlighting the controversial Project 2025 document.","summary":"Stephanie Grisham is one of several Republican figures invited to the convention in Chicago","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/stephanie-grisham-trump-speech-dnc-b2599220.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/21/00/newFile-1.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/07DjtZNh-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-20 23:31:37","author":"Mike Bedigan","authors":["Mike Bedigan"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.239},{"id":254552256,"title":"Harris to officially accept nomination while campaigning in Wisconsin","text":"Harris to officially accept nomination while campaigning in Wisconsin Vice President Kamala Harris is set to officially accept her party's nomination on Day 2 of the DNC, but she'll do it virtually, as she and her running mate will be at a campaign stop in Wisconsin.

His legacy is measured by the lives he has touched and the good he has done,\" Jason said. \"Kamala Harris carries my grandfather’s legacy.\" He continued: \"She knows what is right, and she fights for it. She understands that leadership is about service, not about selfishness. That you can show strength and demonstrate decency. And that you can get a whole lot more done with a smile than with a scowl.\" Jimmy, 99, has been in hospice care for a year and a half, and recently told family that he hopes to live long enough to vote for Harris in the upcoming presidential election. \"My grandfather can’t wait to vote for Kamala Harris,\" Jason said on the DNC stage. \"She reminds us all that the promise of America remains unchanged. We are one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all, and my grandfather knows that with her as our next president, we will keep that promise.\" Jason also gave a brief update on the former president's health, saying, \"Papa is holding on, he is hopeful, and though his body may be weak tonight, his spirit is as strong as ever.\" Jimmy served as president from 1977 until 1981. He became the longest-living U.S. president in 2019 at 94 years old, and began receiving hospice care in February 2023.

On the second night at the “mostly peaceful” gathering of leftists in Chicago, Illinois, former President Barack Obama will return to the main stage and spotlight to give the keynote address at the end of the evening. His wife, former first lady Michelle Obama, will speak earlier in the evening. Interestingly, several Democrats are quite openly referring to Michelle Obama as their “dream candidate,” which means despite the hullabaloo from across the media that Vice President Kamala Harris is not in fact the “dream candidate” for the party. The Democrats are just kind of stuck with Harris, as they had no other options when they staged a coup against the guy who happens to be the sitting president of the United States who’s from their party President Joe Biden. It’s worth noting that they, perhaps conveniently perhaps not, shoved Biden in the trunk of the car at the end of the night well after primetime on Monday night to hasten his march to being yesterday’s news. Speaking of the media, cracks are beginning to emerge across the establishment media when it comes to their close relationship with Democrats and particularly the Harris campaign. Several establishment reporters were critical of the DNC’s unfocused and unusually long and disjointed programming on Monday evening. If the party does not sort out these issues by Tuesday, things could begin to get much worse for Harris and Democrats–and it is definitely something to watch as the evening shakes out. But now that Biden is firmly squashed in history’s dustbin, Democrats will look forward to the next less than 80 days to election day on Nov. 5 and their efforts to try to make the presidential race competitive again. David Plouffe, one of Obama’s closest advisers who seems to be running things at what was the Biden campaign but is now the Harris campaign headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware, did an interview early on Tuesday with Axios where he said the battleground states have returned to the traditional fight like the nation saw in 2016 or 2020. But right after he said that, a new poll emerged out of Virginia showing Republican candidate Donald Trump has again pulled into a statistical tie with Harris in the Old Dominion, flashing more warning signs for Democrats that Trump may be again expanding the map now that Harris’s sugar high has faded. So again, the big picture this evening is a flash back to history in the good ‘ole days for modern Democrats when Obama was president–which comes after they crushed the inconvenient lump of a current president into history already–and a look at what might be the future when the other Obama might emerge in a future race for president, but not this year. Of course, while this all happens, the Democrats will continue to try to convince themselves that everything they know about Harris’s extremism and incompetence was actually a fantasy and that they do in fact have a shot at winning in November despite giant flashing warning signs emerging everywhere already less than a month into Harris’s nascent campaign. And they will try to do it while staying on schedule and not pissing everyone watching off by having pointless speeches drag on too long. Can they execute? Follow along here, because – News will watch so you don’t have to. Below, find live updates with news and analysis from the second night of DNC primetime programming.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nNight two of the Democratic National Convention (DNC) probably cannot go any&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Night 2 of the DNC Live Updates: Obama&#8217;s Comeback and a Promising Candidate for Democrats Beyond Kamala Harris first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/night-2-of-the-dnc-live-updates-obamas-comeback-and-a-promising-candidate-for-democrats-beyond-kamala-harris/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rewrite-this-title-DNC-Livewire-Night-2-Fantasy.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-20 23:29:25","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.287},{"id":254552112,"title":"Here's where Kamala Harris used to live in Evanston","text":"Long before she strode on stage Monday at the United Center as the Democratic presidential nominee, a very young Kamala Harris toddled around a house in Evanston, 13 miles to the north. Harris, born in California in 1964, owes her Illinois connection to her parents’ careers in academia. After a stint in Urbana-Champaign while both parents worked at the University of Illinois, the Harris family moved to Northwestern University in Evanston. There, Harris’ father, Donald Harris, was an assistant professor of economics during the 1967-68 school year. Her mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris, was a staff member in the Biological Sciences Department, according to Northwestern archives. In Evanston, they lived in a house at 620 Library Place, just west of Sheridan Road along the edge of campus. Now, nearly 60 years after the family lived there, Harris hopes to become the first woman — and first Black woman and first Asian American— elected president. And her former residence? It’s now home to the university’s Program of African Studies. The front of the house appears unchanged, though an addition in the back has room for classes, lecture halls and student gatherings. Kelly Coffey, a business administrator in the African Studies program, works in the building. She knew that before the program moved into the house it had been used as housing for professors and their families. But she said that until recently, the staff had no idea of the Harris connection. “I was like, ‘Oh, that’s a surprise,’” Coffey said. “How neat.”","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/politics/kamala-harris/2024/08/20/kamala-harris-dnc-2024-evanston-home-northwestern-university-education-history-politics","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/185c542/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1713+0+144/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F4d%2F7b%2Fd8caa48a4520b1c0c5bc27021372%2Fdsc0","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-20 23:27:42","author":"Mary Norkol","authors":["Mary Norkol"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.076},{"id":254551792,"title":"Kamala’s Response to Biden’s Tearful Speech: “I Gave it Everything”","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris told Joe Biden he was ‘amazing’ and made her ‘cry’ after he finished his emotional address at Democratic National Convention last night, DailyMail.com can reveal. Harris, smiling and clapping as she walked, joined the President on stage after he concluded his speech, embracing him and offering a heartfelt message of support. ‘You made me cry,’ Harris told Biden, according to a lip reader who decoded their exchange. The presidential hopeful, 59, added: ‘I love you so much, you’re amazing.’ Harris also promised the 81-year-old that ‘I’ll stay here with you’, suggesting she will continue to offer guidance to Biden – who had just past the torch to her. Biden delivered his valedictory address to delegates and supporters Monday night, saying, ‘I gave my best to you’ and basking in a long ovation that reflected the energy released by his decision to cede the stage to Harris. He insisted he did not harbor any ill will about the impending end of his tenure – despite reports to the contrary – and called on the party to unite around Harris. Visibly emotional when he took the stage, Biden was greeted by a more than four-minute-long ovation and chants of ‘Thank you Joe.’ He replied: ‘America, I love you.’ The president began by wiping away a tear as his daughter Ashley introduced him. His eyes were also visibly watery during parts of his farewell speech. ‘I made a lot of mistakes in my career, but I gave my best to you,’ Biden said. ‘For 50 years, like many of you, I give my heart and soul to the nation.’ He called his selection of Harris as his running mate four years ago ‘the very first decision I made when I became our nominee, and it was the best decision I made my whole career’. ‘She’s tough, she’s experienced and she has enormous integrity, enormous integrity,’ he said. ‘Her story represents the best American story.’ ‘And like many of our best presidents,’ he added in a nod to his own career, ‘she was also vice president.’ He also insisted he wasn’t angry about stepping aside, despite a slew of Democrats having demanded he drop out, and said he was acting for the good of the country. ‘All this talk about how I’m angry about all the people who said I should step down, that’s not true,’ he said. He noted how he had five months left in office and said: ‘I’ve got a lot to do – I intend to get it done.’ ‘It’s been an honor of my lifetime. I love the job. But I love my country more,’ the president continued. Biden, in his remarks, repeated his 2020 theme that ‘we’re in a battle for the very soul of America,’ and pressed the case for why Harris and her running mate Tim Walz were best prepared to wage it. ‘Because of you, we’ve had the most extraordinary four years of progress ever, period,’ Biden declared. And then he interjected, ‘I say “we,” I mean “me and Kamala”,’ sharing the credit for his most popular successes with the vice president. Biden also vowed: ‘I promise I will be the best volunteer Harris and Walz’s campaign has ever seen.’ Harris and second gentleman Doug Emhoff came out after his address to embrace him and his family. ‘Joe, thank you for your historic leadership, for your lifetime of service to our nation, and for all you’ll continue to do,’ she said earlier in the evening. ‘We are forever grateful to you.’ Harris’s appearance at the convention on Monday night to thank Biden for his leadership was brief and unannounced. She will travel today to Milwaukee for a rally in the swing state of Wisconsin before returning to Chicago late in the evening. Emhoff and former President Barack Obama will speak today on the second day of the convention, turning the party’s attention toward Harris and her faceoff against Republican Donald Trump. The Harris campaign said today that it will spotlight ‘trusted messengers’ from key battleground states over the convention’s three remaining days. They include Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada; Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Sen. Gary Peters and Rep. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan; Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and Sen. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin. From Arizona, Sen.

The odds were reversed when the DNC got underway in Chicago just 24 hours earlier, when Harris was listed as the slight favorite.Harris' odds of beating Trump peaked on August 15, when Polymarket gave her a 54 percent chance of winning to Trump's 44 percent. While the vice president's odds worsened by a small amount on Tuesday, they have generally been on an upward trajectory over the past few weeks.In a Tuesday post to X (formerly Twitter), Polymarket shared a short video showing the changing odds in the presidential race since June 25, when President Joe Biden was still the presumptive Democratic nominee. Trump had a relatively comfortable lead over the Democratic ticket until earlier this month, when Harris drew level with the former president.Meanwhile, rival bookmaker BetOnline.ag listed both Trump and Harris with -110 odds to win as of Tuesday evening. The company told Newsweek that Harris had been leading last week, \"but steady betting on Trump over the past two days has pulled the numbers back to even.\"Most recent polls continue to indicate that Harris has a small but significant lead over Trump nationally. An average of surveys compiled by polling website FiveThirtyEight shows Harris leading Trump by 2.8 points as of Tuesday night.In addition, the polling picture now slightly favors Harris in several key battleground states. The latest FiveThirtyEight averages show that the vice president is ahead by 0.7 points in Arizona, 1.3 points in Pennsylvania, 2.8 points in Michigan and 3.2 points in Wisconsin.Trump has a 1.2 percent lead in Georgia and a tiny 0.2 percent lead in North Carolina, according to Tuesday's FiveThirtyEight averages. The race is dead even in Nevada, where the average shows that each candidate is favored by 44.6 percent of voters.With all signs pointing to a very close race in November, both campaigns will be hoping to capitalize on whatever momentum they can achieve ahead of November 5.The Harris campaign could see some benefits from the DNC after it concludes on Thursday, as major political party conventions typically result in a slight polling bump.The first day of the DNC included speeches from Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain, first lady Jill Biden and a surprise short speech by Harris. Biden delivered the night's closing keynote address.Day two of the DNC was expected to include appearances by several pro-Harris Republicans, including former Trump White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham, along with speeches from independent Senator Bernie Sanders, former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama.","summary":"Trump's betting odds have improved as the Democratic National Convention's second day got underway.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trumps-odds-winning-election-rise-after-dnc-start-1942077","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2454301/donald-trump-betting-odds-improve-dnc-election.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-20 23:22:14","author":"Aila Slisco","authors":["Aila Slisco"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.208},{"id":254552018,"title":"John Dickerson on how Democrats are rallying behind Kamala Harris","text":"John Dickerson on how Democrats are rallying behind Kamala Harris Democrats have coalesced around Vice President Kamala Harris with ease since President Biden decided to end his reelection campaign.

Hogan attended a promotional event for his new brand of beer in Ohio on Monday. At one point during the event, the retired wrestler suggested he would be willing to perform a wrestling move on the Democratic presidential nominee. \"Want me to body-slam Kamala Harris? Want me to drop the leg on Kamala?\" asked the audience at the Ohio bar. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Hogan then questioned Harris' Indian heritage. \"Is Kamala a chameleon? Is Kamala Indian?\" the 71-year-old said. Harris, who is the Democratic presidential nominee, is bi-racial. Her mother is a native of India, while her father was born in Jamaica. WWE LEGEND HULK HOGAN HAS SUPER BOWL ASPIRATIONS FOR LIONS AFTER SURPRISE CAMP VISIT: 'I PREDICT GREATNESS' But, Hogan suggested the remarks were not a true representation of himself. He also blamed the comments on the amount of alcoholic beverages he consumed at the bar. \"I am going to get heat for that one, brother. That was not me. That was the beers talking.\" The legendary wrestler delivered a speech during last month's Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. At one point during the address, Hogan said he was upset when they \"took a shot at my hero.\" The comment referred to the assassination attempt, which occurred in Pennselyvinia in July. He then proceeded to remove his vest and rip the Hogan \"Real American\" shirt he was wearing to reveal a Trump-Vance 2024 shirt — in classic pro wrestling fashion. \"Enough was enough, and I said, ‘Let Trump-a-mania run wild, brother. Let Trump-a-mania rule again. Let Trump-a-mania make America great again,’\" he screamed while flexing his muscles. In 2015, Hogan told TMZ that he was interested in being Trump's running mate. However, Mike Pence, who was the governor of Indiana at the time, was tapped for the Republican ticket. Hogan, like Trump, is a WWE Hall of Famer. The 70-year-old’s wrestling career was over five decades as he made a name for himself in what was known as the World Wrestling Federation at the time and World Championship Wrestling. He also appeared in TNA Wrestling as well. Aside from his pro wrestling appearances, Hogan was also in several films and TV shows, including, \"Rocky III,\" \"Thunder in Paradise,\" \"Mr. Nanny\" and was the subject of the reality TV show \"Hogan Knows Best.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Georgia native is no stranger to controversy. He was wrapped up in a sex tape lawsuit against Gawker. Hogan was also removed from the WWE Hall of Fame for a few years over racist remarks. Hogan eventually apologized and was later reinstated.

Jennifer Granholm praised the party's energy at its national convention in Chicago as Vice President Kamala Harris prepares to formally accept its presidential nomination. \"It is very high,\" Granholm told ABC News about Democrats' enthusiasm. \"People will be exhausted if it stays this high all the way through. But honestly, for Democrats, it has to stay high. There is so much work to do if we can't take anything for granted. These polls are starting to look good. It's clear she's got momentum, but this is not for time to let up on the accelerator.\" Still, Granholm said, it's hard to take anything for granted. Trump remains the leader of his own movement of loyal supporters, and polling in the past has consistently underestimated his support, including in 2016, when he overcame historical trends and his own stumbles to beat former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who Democrats were virtually certain would prevail. \"Always concerned about overconfidence. You always have to run like her 10 points behind. Yes, she's got momentum, but that does not mean you let up, you accelerate. Let's keep going,\" she said. Still, Granholm said, Democrats are putting forth an inspiring candidate. Harris would be a groundbreaking president as a woman of color. But, Democrats have argued, her appeal expands beyond that. \"I do think that it is emblematic of the diversity and coalition that the Democratic Party represents,\" Granholm said. But her policies \"are what really gets and bring people in, in addition to the more than symbolism of having a first in a woman person of color.\" Harris is set to blitz the campaign trail in the sprint to Election Day on Nov. 5, even making a pit stop in Milwaukee, Wis., on Tuesday night while the convention plays out in Chicago. And, Granholm said, it would behoove Harris to have President Joe Biden tag along and allow him to talk about accomplishments that voters may not be aware of, including investments in infrastructure and science and technology. \"What he's done is given her a foundation on which to build,\" she said. \"He's also somebody who has been focused on bipartisanship, so independents and others who may not be aware of what this president has done and be able to help get the word out, for some weirdo reason, people still seem to think that Republicans have a better agenda, when, in fact, for real people, the agenda that the Democrats are putting forward is so much better, he can be a great explainer for that,\" she said.","summary":"Former Michigan Democratic Gov.
