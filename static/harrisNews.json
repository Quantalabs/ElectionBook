Ritchie Torres and a few others, nearly all top Democrats simultaneously denounced Israel and were silent in the face of the antisemitic mobs at home. \n\nWhile Republicans in Congress were condemning Ivy League presidents for failing to protect Jewish students in the face of clear intimidation, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer was privately telling the same people to “keep heads down” because their “problems are really only among Republicans,” according to a message Schumer sent that was released last week. \n\nEven now, most Dems are opposing the White House bid to rid campuses of those who openly support terrorists and call for the death of Jews. \n\nThe rush to protect Khalil is a continuation of a shameful pattern. \n\nBut thanks to Trump, college leaders no longer have the luxury of keeping their heads down and ignoring Republicans and the travesties unfolding on their campuses. \n\nWith a new sheriff in town, resistance would be very, very expensive. \n\n$5B in fed contracts \n\nColumbia, for example, gets about 25% of its operating money from Washington, and reportedly has federal contracts valued at $5 billion over several years. \n\nThe prospect of losing even $400 million in a first round of penalties set off alarms bells and led to disputes in faculty meetings about who would lose their sinecures if Trump turned off the spigot. \n\nMeanwhile, other schools on the list imposed hiring freezes over the possibility they would also have to absorb major cuts. \n\nAlready some of these schools are facing budget problems because the White House, in a bid to save money, plans to limit the overhead funds that follow federal grants. \n\nThose added funds can be as high as 75% of the grant itself and are used to pay for everything from turning on the lights to hiring assistants. \n\nIn some cases, the grants are treated as slush funds for star faculty members and university leaders. \n\nA Trump plan in the works would limit those added funds to 15% of the underlying grant, which is adding to the campus panic. \n\nNaturally, some members of the academic ecosystem are losing their minds over the changes and see Columbia’s surrender as the end of the world. \n\nThat implies a childish fantasy that it’s unfair to attach conditions to taxpayer money. \n\nBesides, what Columbia agreed to are things it should have been doing all along. \n\nBut nothing would have changed if Trump hadn’t dropped the hammer. \n\nAll the pleading and scolding and jawboning in the world would have come to nothing without his threat to take away the money. \n\nWell done, Mr. President.","summary":"The screaming headline was prophetic: “Trump’s Policies Shake Academic World and May Reshape U.S. Culture.”","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/03/22/opinion/michael-goodwin-columbia-university-is-all-about-the-money-as-they-cave-in-to-trumps-demands/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/2025-washington-dc-trump-traveling-100877532-e1742687973316.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-23 00:41:44","author":"Michael Goodwin","authors":["Michael Goodwin"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.102},{"id":303098448,"title":"Donald Trump revokes security clearances for Kamala Harris and Hillary Clinton","text":"US President Donald Trump on Saturday took away security clearances for former vice president Kamala Harris, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton and others in his latest move against his Democratic opponents. The Republican president, who in February said he was revoking the security clearance for former President Joe Biden, defeated Clinton in the 2016 presidential election and Harris in last year&apos;s election. \"I have determined that it is no longer in the national interest for the following individuals to access classified information,\" Trump said in a late Saturday memorandum that also included former Secretary of State Antony Blinken. While the revocations may not have immediate impacts, it is another sign of the growing political rift in Washington as Trump seeks revenge on his perceived enemies. The memorandum was issued hours after Trump arrived at his Bedminster, New Jersey, golf property for the weekend. Trump also targeted Republican former Representative Liz Cheney, a sharp Trump critic, former Biden White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan and Fiona Hill, a Russia expert who served on his National Security Council during his first term. Mark Zaid, a national security lawyer in Washington who represents whistleblowers, and Adam Kinzinger, a former Republican lawmaker who is a sharp Trump critic, were among several others who had their security clearances revoked. Saturday&apos;s order confirmed that Biden&apos;s security clearance had been revoked, denying the former president the traditional access to US intelligence. Former US presidents have traditionally received intelligence briefings so they can advise incumbent presidents on national security and foreign policy.

House Democrats were introduced, without staff, to 40 content creators who Democratic leaders said could help them grow their audience online.\n\nAn earlier tutorial session in February featured online personalities like the YouTube commentator Brian Tyler Cohen.\n\nThe result has been a burst of Democratic online content, including direct-to-camera explainers in parked cars, scripted vertical videos, podcast appearances and livestreams — some topping trending charts online, others drawing mockery from liberal allies and Republicans in Congress. A San Diego Democrat, for instance, warned that her colleagues must avoid “seeming too thirsty” in content.\n\nBut while the Democratic Party is largely divided over the path forward after last year’s election losses, party leaders agree that, no matter the message, how they connect with voters in the digital landscape will be key to a political comeback.\n\nAim to Double Engagement \n\nMore than a dozen Democratic senators, asked about the party’s digital strategy, pointed to Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey as the architect.\n\n“We’ve seen tremendous growth of Democratic senators now. They’re engaging in the tools and strategies necessary to elevate their voice in a new, changing media market, where legacy media is not the place that people get their news now,” Booker said. “We’re just weeks into this, but just by making key changes … we’re seeing a massive growth in engagement with the content that our senators are creating, and we’ve only just begun.”\n\nBooker said he’s aiming for Democratic senators to double online engagement with their content over the next year — and early metrics have been noticeable. Democratic senators racked up more than 87 million views on content they published in response to Trump’s joint address to Congress, according to Booker’s office.\n\nEfforts Draw Republican Mockery\n\nNot all of that online engagement is positive. After more than two dozen Democratic senators posted identical scripted videos knocking Trump’s speech, saying he should have addressed the cost of living and his support for billionaire adviser Elon Musk, conservatives mocked them as inauthentic and out of touch.\n\n“They are all actors reading a script,” Musk wrote on X, the social media platform he owns.\n\nThere’s no doubt that Democrats are playing catch-up. Trump and his fellow Republicans built a digital operation that fed on bombast and celebrity, and it’s a strategy they’ve taken with them to the White House. Official government accounts are new filled with right-wing memes, cinematic videos and pugnacious statements.\n\nThe Democratic embrace of influencers has also yielded mixed early results. Democrats were ridiculed online after Sulhee Jessica Woo, a food and wellness influencer who attended the House Democrats’ creators event, came up with a “Choose Your Fighter” video collage of Democratic congresswomen for Women’s History Month.\n\nThe White House posted a video in response that read “America chose its fighters last November,” and the Pentagon, normally known for being studiously non-partisan, posted a video stating “We chose our fighters a long time ago.”\n\nBut Booker and other Democratic leaders don’t consider the sneers to be a downside. Missteps are to be expected, they say, but the path to Americans’ attention will require some discomfort from lawmakers.\n\n“I do think that the caucus as a whole is trying to figure out how we show people that we are real people,” said Rep. Jasmine Crockett of Texas, one of the congresswomen featured in the viral “Fighter” video. Crockett, whose posts regularly garner millions of views online, said she was used to criticism for her often frank statements and was more interested in combating perceptions that Democrats are “elitist” or “robotic.”\n\n“I didn’t like the jumping, I’m going to be honest, though,” Crockett added about the viral “Choose Your Fighter” video.\n\nMore Aggressive Digital Posture\n\nDemocrats adopted a more combative stance online in recent weeks as Trump’s moves to slash the federal workforce drew protests from liberals and pushback at GOP town halls. Top Democratic digital operatives who worked for the 2024 presidential campaign of then-Vice President Kamala Harris have been in high demand, with many Democrats anticipating close 2026 races in which digital strategies may be key.\n\nSome of the most prominent Democrats across the country have been engaging more in new media since the election. \n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York has touted the party’s message on progressive podcasts over the last month, including from the comedian Jon Stewart and the progressive outlet MeidasTouch. Clips of those videos were also lampooned online but garnered millions of views.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom, a potential Democratic presidential contender in 2028, has launched a podcast of his own on which he has welcomed close Trump allies like the right-wing activist Charlie Kirk and former Trump aide Steve Bannon to discuss hot-button political topics.\n\n“We want to make sure we hit the podcasters that normally don’t have Democrats on there,” said Rep. Derek Tran, a Democrat from a competitive House district in Cypress. “The ones that are more right-leaning or independent, and be able to address a crowd and an audience that’s not typical for the Democratic base.”\n\nDivide on message \n\nSome House Democrats have expressed frustration that the guidance from Democratic leaders about social media is too vague, while others grumble that leaders are too prescriptive in their approach to messaging on platforms they don’t intuitively understand. \n\nMeanwhile, Democratic strategists have cautioned lawmakers that garnering attention online is secondary to the goal of using social media as a tool in specific policy fights and campaigns.\n\n“I think there’s a fine line before we’re being cringe and trying too hard and seeming too thirsty. I think the most important thing in any of this is being as authentic and genuine as we can be,” said Rep. Sara Jacobs, (D-San Diego).\n\n“When it comes to authenticity, it also means leaning into what makes each of us unique. Like many of my colleagues probably should not be doing ‘get ready with me’ videos. It would look super cringe. But I’m a 36-year-old woman, and I do my makeup all the time, and I watch a lot of makeup tutorial videos, so it makes sense for me to do it,” said Jacobs.\n\nSome Democrats think that the party’s messaging strategy hinges as much on the messengers as the medium.\n\n“If you know how to talk to people, it doesn’t matter what medium is going to exist,” said Sen. Ruben Gallego, a freshman Democratic senator from Arizona. “You could be the best freaking spokesperson in the world, but if you don’t know how to talk to working-class people, it doesn’t matter if you have the best TikTok following, it’s just not going to translate.”","summary":"Whether topping trending charts or drawing mockery from liberal allies and GOP foes, there has has been a burst of Democratic content.","url":"https://timesofsandiego.com/tech/2025/03/22/democrats-in-adopting-new-digital-strategy-hope-to-engage-voters-but-avoid-being-cringe/","image":"https://timesofsandiego.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/0.mast_.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-22 23:30:42","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.044},{"id":303093904,"title":"Rosie O'Donnell floats bizarre conspiracy theory about Elon Musk after fleeing US after election","text":"Rosie O'Donnell floats bizarre conspiracy theory about Elon Musk after fleeing US after election\n\nPODCAST: All the latest headlines, including Trump’s bold move to void Biden’s pardons and Gavin Newsom’s unexpected statue plans\n\nBy JAMES GORDON FOR DAILYMAIL.COM\n\nPublished: 23:10 GMT, 22 March 2025 | Updated: 23:10 GMT, 22 March 2025\n\nRosie O'Donnell has suggested the 2024 presidential election may have been stolen during her first Irish television interview since leaving the United States for Ireland.\n\nThe famously outspoken comedian and former talk show host spoke with Patrick Kielty on Friday's The Late Late Show on the Irish channel RTE One in which she implicated tech billionaire Elon Musk without naming him directly.\n\n'I question why for the first time in American history, a president has won every swing state and his largest donor was a man who owns and runs the internet,' O'Donnell said. \n\n'I would hope that would be investigated,' she added. 'Whether or not it was an anomaly... or something else that happened on election night in America.'\n\nO'Donnell told Kielty how she found Trump's win strange because then-Vice President Kamala Harris was 'filling up stadiums with people who supported her and Donald Trump was not able to do that.' \n\nNow self-exiled in Ireland, O'Donnell explained how she fled the US following what she calls a 'terrifying' sequence of political events. \n\n'The president of the United States has it out for me,' she said, referring to Donald Trump, with whom she's had a public feud spanning decades. \n\nShe explained how her critique of Trump's bankruptcies and sexual assault allegations on TV show The View had made her a long-term target.\n\nRosie O'Donnell has suggested the 2024 presidential election may have been stolen during her first Irish television interview since leaving the United States for Ireland\n\nO'Donnell implicated tech billionaire Elon Musk without naming him directly\n\nDuring a recent White House meeting with the Irish prime minister, Micheál Martin, Trump took a shot her saying the PM was 'better off' not knowing who she was \n\n'He hasn't let it go. He uses me as a punchline whenever he feels the need.'\n\n'The Supreme Court has given him ultimate power - the powers of a king or a monarch,' she warned, referring to what she perceives as the erosion of American democracy. 'That's not what the United States is about. It's terrifying.' \n\nIt appears Trump has not forgotten O'Donnell either. During a recent White House meeting with the Irish prime minister, Micheál Martin, Trump took a shot her saying the PM was 'better off' not knowing who she was. \n\nO'Donnell said she sent an apology note to the prime minister's office following the Trump meeting.\n\nO'Donnell now lives in Howth, a coastal town in Ireland, where she says her daughter Clay is thriving, charmed by the Irish pub culture. \n\n'She told me at dinner, \"Mommy, I like it here better. You can just be a normal person.\"'\n\nDespite settling into Irish life, O'Donnell insists she's not done with America entirely.\n\n'A large part of me does [want to go back and fight],' she said. 'That's what I've done my whole career.'\n\nBut before that, O'Donnell says she now plans to pursue Irish citizenship.\n\nTaking to earlier this month, the actress and comedian shared a nine-minute video in which she updated fans about her new life outside of the US\n\nO'Donnell's feud with Trump dates back to 2006, when she criticized him on The View for allowing that year's Miss USA pageant winner, Tara Conner, to keep her crown after she was caught drinking underage\n\nKnown for her harsh war of words with Trump over the years, long before he became president, the mother of five has been even more vocal to hammer his tough talk and policies in interviews and on social media since he started his first term in 2016.\n\nO'Donnell's feud with Trump dates back to 2006, when she criticized him on 'The View' for allowing that year's Miss USA pageant winner, Tara Conner, to keep her crown after she was caught drinking underage.\n\nTrump owned the Miss USA competition at the time and decided to not to strip the 20-year-old model's title, stating he believed in 'second chances' and that Conner would be going into rehab.\n\nWhen Trump heard that O'Donnell had mocked Conner's conduct, he called her 'a real loser.'\n\nOver the years, Trump has said 'The Flintstones' actress is 'dumb,' 'desperate,' 'fat,' and 'disgusting both inside and out.'\n\nHe also said that if he were in charge of The View, which O'Donnell was on for a brief time in the 2006-2007 season, he would have fired her.\n\n'I'd fire Rosie, I mean I'd look her right in that fat, ugly face of hers and I'd say, \"Rosie, you're fired,\"' he said, borrowing his catchphrase from 'The Apprentice.'\n\nTheir war of words reignited in 2015, after Trump shocked the world and announced a run for the White House.\n\nDuring a Republican primary debate in August, moderator Megyn Kelly asked the then-real estate magnate and television personality about his treatment of women.\n\n'You've called women you don't like fat pigs, dogs, slobs and disgusting animals,' Kelly said.\n\nTrump interjected with, 'Only Rosie O'Donnell.' The one-liner got a tremendous response from the audience, who filled the auditorium with laughs and cheers.\n\nHillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee in 2016, later attacked Trump in a debate, pointing out that he had called women nasty names just like Kelly had.\n\nIn that September debate, Trump once again name-dropped O'Donnell as a defense.\n\n'Rosie O’Donnell — I said very tough things to her, and I think everybody would agree that she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her,' he said.\n\nIn one of more recent critiques she shared a video on TikTok of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky hugging children and picking them up with a smile on his face.\n\n'If only the current president had a drop of his caring committed heart #resist #protest #defythem #love #FDT,' she wrote in the caption.\n\nIn December, O'Donnell took to TikTok to bash Time magazine for naming Donald Trump its man of the year for 2024, as reported by The Daily Beast. \n\n'Man of the year, Donald Trump. Well, f**k you Time Magazine. F**k you, seriously,' O'Donnell said. 'How about most dangerous man of the year? How about most criminal man of the year?

Gavin Newsom Basically Abandons All Of His Past Positions","text":"As if there were any doubt that California Gov. Gavin Newsom is prolifically dishonest and a consummate disingenuous politician, his new podcast should end it. Newsom, after a series of governing failures culminated in the historically disastrous Los Angeles fires in January, launched his podcast to try and change public perception of him and his views. Despite governing as a far-left progressive, enacting authoritarian lockdowns, mask mandates and vaccine passports, Newsom is now trying to rebrand himself as a \"common sense\" Democrat. There's just one problem: in order to do it, he's completely contradicting policy positions he supported, celebrated, and even signed into law. Gavin Newsom Gets Roasted By CNN Story Of all places, CNN (CNN!) posted a story covering Newsom's incredible about-face on a litany of important issues where his positions are now extremely unpopular. In his new podcast, This Is Gavin Newsom, the 57-year-old politician has now said he rejects the term \"Latinx,\" a nonsensical made-up term by progressive Democrats hoping to redefine language. He even said that nobody in his office uses the term, that he has no idea where it comes from. Except, of course, there are videos of Newsom himself using it repeatedly during press conferences. Whoops! Then he said that he doesn't want transgender athletes competing in women's sports, becoming one of the only prominent Democrats to acknowledge biological reality. And, per CNN, \"suggested he opposes taxpayer-funded gender transition surgeries for prisoners and detained immigrants.\" But once again, his own actions and comments paint a completely different picture. Back in 2014, Newsom posted celebrating a new California law that allowed male athletes to compete against women, an indefensible position that has just 24 percent support even in his own far-left state. READ: California Voters Might Finally Be Done With Decades Of Democrat Party Failure Then when Republicans tried and failed to repeal it, he celebrated again. Just a few years ago in 2020, Newsom then signed a new extreme bill, forced through by California's delusional legislature, which allowed male prisoners to be housed with women, while also \"acknowledging their need for gender transition care.\" He expanded the state's Medicaid program to pay for healthcare for illegal aliens and allows for taxpayer-funded \"gender transition surgery.\" Now, in his podcast, he says that taxpayer-funded surgeries are on the losing side of a \"90/10\" debate. \"‘Trump’s for you, she’s for they/them,’\" Newsom said, describing President Trump's ad campaign on Kamala Harris' position. \"Devastating. And she didn’t even react to it, which was more devastating … people that are incarcerated and illegal and illegal incarcerated individuals getting taxpayer-funded gender reassignment surgery. That is a 90/10 not an 80/20.\" Except here's the text of a law Newsom himself signed enacting that exact policy: \"Some transgender, nonbinary, and intersex people experience gender dysphoria that requires medical treatment, while others do not experience gender dysphoria,\" it says. \"Due to safety concerns, inconsistent medical and mental health care, insufficient education and resources, and other factors, incarceration often serves as a barrier to gender transition.\" Welcome to California, welcome to Gavin Newsom, welcome to endless left-wing hypocrisy. Newsom has no actual values, no principles, only the pursuit of more power and influence. He's willing to say or do anything, as long as he believes it fits with The Current Thing.

For the president, it marks another stop on his tour of major sporting events in what has been one of the most sport-focused presidencies in American history. And Trump will be there to potentially see a chapter in the sports' history, as Penn State is looking to run up a streak of four straight national titles. It would the third time Penn State wins four straight championships since 2011, as only Iowa and Ohio State have interrupted the Nittany Lions' run of dominance. And Penn State is firmly in the drivers' seat to do it, leading with 169 points – 60-point margin over second-place Nebraska. \"We're going to the big fight. The reason I'm going is in Philadelphia. They have the NCAA, world, wrestling for college. And I've always supported the wrestlers,\" Trump told reporters outside the White House on Friday. \"So I want to support them. These are the great college wrestlers from the various schools. I think Penn State is leading, and Nebraska is in second place right now. And a lot of good things.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM OutKick co-founder Clay Travis broke the news that Trump would attend the event on Tuesday when he said in an X post that he would be traveling \"with\" the president on \"Air Force One\" to the championships. The White House confirmed Friday that Trump would attend the event. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, is also reportedly joining Trump in Philadelphia, a source familiar with his plans told Fox News Digital. Jordan himself was a noted wrestling champion during his time in high school and at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where he won the NCAA Division I men's wrestling title twice. He was later an assistant coach at Ohio State University's wrestling program from 1987 to 1995. Sen. Dave McCormick, R-Pa., will also be tagging along. McCormick previously confirmed that Trump would be in attendance at the event in the senator's home state of Pennsylvania. \"I’m thrilled to be in Philadelphia this weekend with [Trump] for the [NCAA Wrestling] Championship,\" McCormick wrote on X. \"I grew up wrestling in small towns across PA and at West Point. It taught me grit, resilience, and hard work.\" LA TIMES WRITERS SUGGEST WORLD SERIES CHAMPION DODGERS SHOULD SKIP WHITE HOUSE VISIT: 'THANKS, BUT NO' This will be the second time in three years that President Donald Trump has attended the NCAA Wrestling Championships, as he went in 2023 when they were in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Trump has been seen at a few different sporting events since winning the Presidential election in November. Trump attended the Daytona 500 in February and became the first sitting president to attend two Daytona 500 races at Daytona International Speedway. He attended the race the first time in February 2020. Trump was a fixture in the pre-race festivities as he rode in \"The Beast\" for a lap before the iconic race and had a special message for drivers that was broadcast on their radios. Earlier in February, Trump became the first sitting president to ever attend a Super Bowl. When Trump was shown in the stadium, a raucous cheer was heard on the FOX broadcast from the crowd. In December, Trump attended the 125th edition of the Army-Navy football game with Vice President JD Vance, Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard among others. Trump attended the annual rivalry game throughout his presidency, first attending in 2016 shortly after winning that year's election. He also was at the game during each year of his presidency, including in 2020 at West Point.

Mystified, he wound his Ring doorbell footage back until 12.41am and caught the heist in action.\n\nThe footage showed two teenagers run up the steps, unhook the flag, and sprint back to a waiting pickup truck, laughing and hollering as they fled.\n\nKurt's neighbor caught the flag bandits in action and described the same scene - drunk teens noisily rolling up in a truck, grabbing the flag, and screeching off into the night.\n\nThe teens were 'quite loud and disturbing' and they heard the sounds of 'crunching' and 'things being thrown', according to police reports.\n\nThe witness even 'heard the suspects egging each other on throughout the incident'.\n\nBefore long, Gerrard and Kurt discovered they were far from the only victims in the tiny town of just 5,500 on Maryland's Eastern Shore.\n\nNine residents, including the local Episcopal church, reported their flags and other rainbow items stolen, and some had their yards vandalized.\n\nPolice didn't take long to track the thieves down - they had security footage, the witness' descriptions, and a ping from a license plate reader.\n\nBut when they identified them, the case took another unexpected turn. The seven offenders were teens from Amish villages 150 miles away in Pennsylvania.\n\nMuch of the religious sect communities don't let members use any modern technology, let alone ride around on pickup trucks while drunk.\n\nAn exception is during the adolescent rite of passage called rumspringa, when some rebellious Amish youth leave their villages to experience to outside world.\n\nThough almost 90 percent choose to return and commit themselves to the Amish way of life, many will enjoy a riotous time breaking the rules before they do.\n\nBut terrorizing a town in another state, raiding homes for rainbow flags, and burning them in a bonfire was too far even by rumspringa standards.\n\nMahlon Luke Fisher, 20, of Newburg, Jason Duane Smucker, 19, from Lykens, and John Caleb Stoltzfus, 18, of Gratz, were charged along with four minors aged 16 to 17.\n\nChestertown Police didn't hold back, and decided to throw the book at them - charging the whole group with hate crimes on July 15 last year.\n\nIn all there were 40 charges for each of the adults, also including theft, malicious destruction of property, contributing to the condition of a child, burglary, and fourth-degree theft.\n\n'Guys are going to be guys,' one of them told police with a shrug, explaining they 'did not stand for what the flags meant'.\n\n'Boys will be boys,' another of the juvenile suspects agreed. \n\nChestertown isn't the kind of place you expect your home to be raided, much less in a coordinated strike over several hours late at night.\n\nSo few crimes are committed, mostly driving offences, that they can be jotted down in a column of the local newspapers.\n\nFounded in 1700 and once a thriving shipping hub second only to Annapolis, it's now a sleepy settlement where many families pass down their homes through generations and mistrust outsiders.\n\nThe downtown area is an oddity for rural America. It's not uncommon to see rainbow flags flying from its 19th Century homes and businesses during pride month each June, as they were that night on June 16 last year.\n\nSo too were Kamala Harris lawn signs during the election campaign, in contrast to the town's outskirts and surrounding area that are deeply conservative.\n\nKent County, of which Chestertown is the capital, voted only 50 percent to 47 percent in favor of Donald Trump. \n\nBut it favored Republicans in the House and Senate by comfortable margins, and overwhelmingly backed conservatives in the 2022 state elections.\n\nGerrard, a social worker with a Mississippi drawl who has been with his husband for almost 31 years, thought he was safe in his charming wooden home steps from the Chester River. That being shattered still stings.\n\n'Probably the most disturbing part of it for me was when they took the flag, you heard them laughing as they ran back to their truck,' he told DailyMail.com.\n\n'That was kind of a extra blow in a way, it's like, look at these boys they're and they're laughing at what they did.'\n\nWith the Amish boys charged, the town had to figure out what to do with them.\n\nFining them was pointless, as they had little or no money and didn't need it while living in their closed communities, but a slap on the wrist wouldn't be enough.\n\nThe nine victims got together to discuss what outcome they wanted to advocate for with the court, and prepare impact statements.\n\nThey included both gay men and women, straight couples showing their support for the local LGBTQ community, and leaders of the vandalized church.\n\nReverend Claire Nevin-Field, rector of Emmanuel Episcopal Church, which puts up a rainbow flag and banner every June, was one of the key voices in the group.\n\n'I can keep ordering banners and flags as quickly as they are taken down,' she declared after erecting a new set just hours after the thefts.\n\nFor months they discussed how far to go. Some were angry and wanted to throw the book at the boys, while others refused to wreck their young lives.\n\n'The judge and state prosecutor were like, well, we can throw them in jail,' Gerrard recalled.\n\n'But we didn't really wanna ruin the boys, we just wanted them to learn a lesson... it's not like they killed anybody.\n\n'Throwing them in jail for a week, they're not gonna learn anything from that.'\n\nEventually, they came to a resolution - make the punishment fit the crime by having the Amish boys give back to the community they wronged.\n\nThe three adults fronted the Kent County Circuit Court on January 22 to learn their fate. \n\n'I was shocked at how young they were, it really almost brought tears to my eyes when they walked into the courtroom and we were sitting on the benches,' Gerrard said.\n\n'I was like, these are just boys.'\n\nState's Attorney Bryan DiGregory told the court he was issuing a stet notice on the case, which indefinitely postpones a prosecution if the defendant abides by a set of conditions.\n\nFisher, Smucker, and Stoltzfus were required to complete 80 hours of community at a center that assists the LGBTQ+ community, near their homes in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe juveniles must do 30 hours of the same community service. None of the teens face conviction if they fulfil the conditions, and can apply for expungement.\n\nAfter the verdict was handed down, the boys and two of their fathers met with several of the victims in a back room of the courthouse to apologize. \n\n'It was uncomfortable because we were across the table from these boys and they had just been sentenced,' Gerrard recalled.\n\nThe teens, still wearing modern clothes, stayed mostly silent while their fathers in traditional, plain Amish outfits, begged for forgiveness.\n\n'They were very apologetic for their behavior of their sons,' Gerrard said.\n\n'They said, \"We're not a community that does this\", and they talked about the shame that the boys had brought on the Amish community.'\n\nHaving left their villages at 4am to face judgement, the unruly rumspringa teens returned home - on a much tighter leash.\n\nThomas Maronick, whose firm represented the Amish teens, said the punishment was a good resolution that allowed them to avoid convictions.\n\n'These kids were just youngsters who made some bad decisions. They were just pranks, but they were hurtful to others,' he said.\n\n'This was a tremendous learning experience for them, they're gonna be much better people from it, and I'm happy with the result that will let them have clean records.\n\n'Bryan DiGregory worked very hard with victims to come up with this... It's a situation where you had a number of victims and they had different opinions.'\n\nMaronick said some of the teens traveled to South Carolina last year to help rebuild homes destroyed by Hurricane Helene.\n\n'It's just it's incredible to see that that level of support of people who are really in need and let's just say what happened was out of character,' he said.","summary":"Amish teens enjoying the rite of passage that allows them out into the modern world went a bit too far when they descended on Chestertown, Maryland, and were charged with hate crimes.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14491411/Amish-Rumspringa-lgbtq-pride-flags-stolen-Chestertown-Maryland.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/21/17/96392813-0-image-m-20_1742578832691.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/03/12/1961147680416315750/1024x576_MP4_1961147680416315750.mp4","publish_date":"2025-03-22 20:36:13","author":"Editor,Nic White","authors":["Editor","Nic White"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.362},{"id":303074754,"title":"James Carville says Dems were ‘stupid’ for ignoring rural US voters — and they ‘ought to apologize’","text":"Democratic strategist James Carville declared that the Democratic Party was “stupid” for ignoring rural American voters in the last presidential election, saying it should “apologize.”\n\nCarville made the statement during the Thursday episode of his “Politics War Room” podcast, arguing that the party has become “self-righteous” and written off rural voters. \n\n“You know, the stupidity of, ‘we’ve got to be the most progressive self-righteous moralistic people in the world,’” he said, describing his impression of the party’s perspective. “And, you know, ‘people who live in rural America – just you know fat, lazy, and stupid,’ which is decidedly not true.”\n\nHe added, “But that’s the way that some of the urbanist elements of our party have tried to come across and it’s stupid, and they ought to apologize to the world for being so g–damn stupid.”\n\nThe strategist was responding to a listener’s question about whether the Democratic Party should start focusing on campaigning in rural areas. The former Bill Clinton campaign political operative said it should, and rebuked the party for allegedly overlooking them.\n\n“Well, I think it was always the time for Democrats to campaign hard in rural areas. I don’t know how the party ever got away from that,” he said.\n\nCarville added that some of the “more urbanist members and commentators” representing the party have “lived in a folly of a world that we could exist in elections by just concentrating on large urban areas that are not even that strategically located.”\n\nHe said that now the Democratic Party has an opportunity to reintroduce itself to middle America and should take advantage of that.\n\nCarville has provided a steady stream of criticism for his party since its election loss to President Donald Trump in November, an election he predicted would be won by former Vice President Kamala Harris. \n\nIn a recent interview with Fox News Digital, the former Clinton advisor criticized the party’s recent anti-Trump tactics, saying they’re “not meeting the moment.”\n\nReferring specifically to their divisive outbursts during Trump’s address to a joint session of Congress earlier this month, he said, “My first commandment of politics is, ‘Thine shall not make an a– of thyself.’ And they didn’t follow the Carville first commandment.”\n\nIn a FoxNews.com op-ed published Mar. 12, Carville urged the party to take a “strategic political retreat” and allow Trump to sink himself with his policies.\n\n“I mean, it’s an old military doctrine – when your opponent is destroying themselves, do not interfere.

Sanders, an Independent, sought the Democratic nomination in 2016 and 2020.\n\nHarris’s former running-mate Tim Walz was also tied with Ocasio-Cortez at 5 percent, as was California Gov.

Now, she's allowed to speak her mind, but I'd argue that doing so requires a firm grasp of reality. If, in her opinion, cutting government waste and fraud while tightening the borders isn't her bag, she's entitled to that opinion. …or she could just completely make up an alternative narrative about everything that happened during the last election and lie to everyone in her adopted homeland. She chose the latter. During an appearance on the Irish network RTÉ's The Late, Late Show, O'Donnell was asked if she could respect that people chose to vote for her ol' buddy Donald Trump.

Alright… who wants to tell her? Who wants to tell her that Elon Musk owns X, which is not the same as the internet? My grandma who still calls it \"the Facebook\" knows the difference. And, if she's concerned about this, I'm sure she was vocal about mainstream media and the intelligence community suppressing stories that may have hurt Biden's campaign back in 2020. I thought for sure there was going to be a joke coming, but nope, she's just that deep in the throes of TDS. But there was more of Rosie's delusions to come, when she claimed that Kamala Harris was \"filling up stadiums with people who supported her, and Donald Trump was not able to do that.\" Talk about detached from reality.

Then he met Donald Trump","text":"In the wake of Donald Trump's heated Oval Office meeting with Volodymyr Zelensky last month, the European Union's foreign policy chief, Kallas Kaja declared: \"The free world needs a new leader.\"\n\nCould it be British Prime Minister Keir Starmer?\n\nWhile French President Emmanuel Macron posted about Ukrainians \"fighting for their dignity, their independence, their children and the security of Europe\", Starmer picked up the phone to Trump and Zelenskyy and started working on plan to bring peace to Ukraine.\n\nAs Mr Trump's policies continue to divide both voters in the United States and the international community too, the British PM has seemingly been among the biggest beneficiaries.\n\nDespite winning a landslide general election victory in July last year, Mr Starmer has never been particularly popular among voters.\n\nNow, that's changing.\n\nAfter an intense period of international diplomacy on Ukraine, the UK PM's favourability rating rose to a six-month high of 31 per cent with YouGov respondents in early March.\n\n\"He's a serious guy in very serious times,\" author of Keir Starmer: The Biography, Tom Baldwin, told the ABC.\n\nStarmer had been in the same Oval Office seat as President Zelenskyy some 48 hours before the now infamous clash but received a warm welcome.\n\nThe fact Starmer called Trump after he was shot on the campaign trail last year, and the UK government undertook a charm offensive in the lead-up to the US election, might have had something to do with that.\n\nUK Foreign Secretary David Lammy, who in opposition called Trump a \"racist KKK and Nazi sympathiser\", and others had spent months attempting to build bridges with Republicans.\n\nThe UK Labour Party, who would call Kamala Harris's Democrats their sister party, felt they had made progress and were delighted that Lammy was even offered a second helping of chicken at a meeting with Trump and his team — a sure sign, by all accounts, that the US president likes you.\n\nStarmer had also appointed Lord Peter Mandelson, an architect of Tony Blair's huge victory in the 1990s and one of the party's most effective political operators, as the UK's ambassador to the US.\n\nAll of which, Starmer surely hoped, would leave his government in a strong position to, as he would later call it, act as a \"bridge\" between Europe and the US when Trump returned to power.\n\nHis team wanted to leave little to chance.\n\nTrying to lock in a US security guarantee for Ukraine during his own visit to the White House, Starmer employed all the tools at his disposal, including hand-delivering an invite from King Charles for a second state visit in front of the world's media.\n\nStarmer described the offer as \"unprecedented\" and \"very special\".\n\nThat pleased Trump but received backlash from some UK MPs, who saw it as unnecessary.\n\n\"He wouldn't mind at all that some people on the left [of politics] felt he was a little bit too obsequious to Trump — he doesn't care,\" Mr Baldwin said.\n\n\"He doesn't mind when people say he looked a little bit wooden or boring … what matters is outcomes\".\n\nNo US security guarantee was locked in, nor a new US-UK trade deal signed, but the meeting landed well with a British public nervous about the disintegration of the UK's transatlantic alliance.\n\nIt signalled the so-called \"special relationship\" between the US and UK may not be in jeopardy at a time of global turmoil.\n\nStarmer's international performance welcomed\n\nStarmer himself said he wants to be a \"bridge\" between the US and Europe, but polling showed the public wasn't confident in his abilities to wrangle Donald Trump.\n\nA week after the meeting, the public had a rosier view on his performance on the issue of Ukraine.\n\nDays after the White House meltdown between Zelenskyy and Trump, Starmer hosted the Ukrainian president at Downing Street.\n\nStarmer also convened a meeting with world leaders, to discuss the war and Europe's response to it, the first of a number as he and French president Emmanuel Macron try to spearhead a new approach which, in the worst-case scenario, may not include America.\n\nCalling it a \"coalition of the willing\", the collective response could see troops from several European countries on the ground in Ukraine under a peace deal.\n\nIt is practical action Starmer excels at, Mr Baldwin said.\n\n\"He doesn't have the sort of three-word slogans and this big political vision, he comes across as a sort of grey figure, not dissimilar in some ways to [Prime Minister] Albanese, [who has] spent his life in politics … [Starmer is] a sort of ordinary person within politics,\" he said.\n\nStarmer was the first in his family to go to university. His father was a toolmaker and his mother lived with a disability.\n\nOn finishing law school, he become a prominent human rights lawyer and then top prosecutor and head of the country's Crown Prosecution Service.\n\nHis allies would say he is rarely daunted by a huge challenge and was no stranger to David and Goliath-style battles during his days as a lawyer.\n\nKnown as the \"McLibel\" case, he represented two environmentalists against McDonald's in what was the longest trial of its kind in English legal history.\n\nMr Baldwin said that Starmer's background was a \"combination of outsider-insider\" and had shaped his approach to political life.\n\n\"His own seriousness and his disdain for performative politics and that kind of shallow day-to-day politics of what passes for political debate in this country has found its moment,\" Mr Baldwin reflected.\n\nVoters critical of Starmer's performance at home\n\nStarmer's Labour Party was elected on a mandate for change.\n\nWhile his performance on the international stage has been largely well-received, Luke Tryl from think-tank More in Common (MiC) said domestically he has faced significant headwinds.\n\nAfter years of Conservative Party rule, scandals under Boris Johnson's leadership and Liz Truss's short but dramatic time in the top job helped Labour to an election victory.\n\nThe prolonged period of dysfunction also helped the far-right Reform UK party gain a foothold.\n\nSo far, polling would suggest the public hasn't been impressed by the new Labour government, or Starmer's performance.\n\nBritain's economy has struggled post-Brexit, meaning anaemic growth and the public seeing little improvement in their standard of living for several years.\n\nVoters were blindsided by a controversial decision by the Starmer government to means-test a benefit for pensioners to help with winter fuel costs.\n\nMr Tryl said it has felt as though the public's desire for a period of renewal sometimes came up against Starmer's \"stolid\" leadership style.\n\nAs with his response to the war in Ukraine, the riots sparked by the killings of three children in Southport provided him with a domestic opportunity to respond to a crisis.\n\nBut MiC polling found that at one point, Nigel Farage, the leader of far-right party Reform UK, was preferred prime minister to Starmer.\n\n\"Trump's handling of Ukraine … has provided Keir Starmer with an opportunity to reintroduce himself to the public, to reset his premiership,\" Mr Tryl said.\n\nAfter the Oval Office meeting and international work on Ukraine, he leads Farage again by six points on MiC's polling.\n\nHis approval rating has also improved by 12 points, but remains at minus 27 on MiC's numbers.\n\n\"It does seem to be directly related to his handling of Ukraine,\" Mr Tryl said.\n\n\"That kind of stolid, reassuring leadership is giving people what they need. People are feeling quite discombobulated by Trump, about Ukraine and global affairs, and they quite like the idea of having, to use that very cliched phrase, a grown up in charge.\n\n\"Thirty-seven per cent of the public say that the conflict has made them feel more positively towards Keir Starmer, including 28 per cent of those who didn't vote for Labour, and in particular, he gets plaudits for his attempts to act as a bridge between the US and Europe — 48 per cent think that's a good idea, just 16 per cent think that it's a bad idea,\" he said.\n\nDespite his change in fortunes, Mr Tryl wasn't sure Ukraine would be the defining issue of his prime ministership.\n\n\"Whilst Ukraine might give him another hearing with voters, his future is going to be decided by, come 2028, can people get GP appointments more easily, has he made progress on tackling Channel crossings, and is the cost of the weekly shop feeling more affordable for people?\"\n\nTom Baldwin wasn't so sure they would be the issues that would continue to dominate politics in the UK or Australia.\n\n\"He doesn't care if China dominates your region of the world and whether Russia dominates Eastern Europe.\n\n\"That's going to have profound consequences. I wonder whether all politics, including Australian politics, are going to be less about living standards and getting GP appointments and actually going to be about how do we stay safe in a really dangerous world in the next few years?\"\n\nUkraine an opportunity for UK-Europe reset\n\nKim Darroch is a former UK ambassador to the US, and fell foul of Mr Trump's unpredictable nature when his private communications criticising the president were leaked.\n\nHe is a member of the House of Lords and a board member at Best for Britain, which campaigns for closer ties between Britain and Europe.\n\n\"The irony here is that Donald Trump has done far more to push UK closer to Europe than any number of campaign groups, because of what appears to be the emerging US policy on Ukraine and because of his apparent intention to basically draw America back from Europe,\" Mr Darroch said.\n\nHe said the most urgent issue for the Starmer government was the economy.\n\nStarmer is under increasing pressure to choose between striking a US-UK trade deal and rebuilding Britain's trading relationship with the EU, though Downing Street has rejected the idea the two ambitions are at odds.\n\n\"The government set itself in its campaign promises before the election against rejoining the single market, against rejoining the EU customs union. I think that's a pity,\" he said.\n\n\"I think we should be much more ambitious than the rather modest proposals that the government has so far, which are a security pact with Europe and Phytosanitary agreement, and possibly something on youth movement — that seems to be a rather thin agenda for such an important challenge.\"\n\nHe said the \"coalition of the willing\" on Ukraine, and aligning views on the need for countries to increase defence spending across the continent, provided a moment to reset UK and European relations post-Brexit.\n\n\"Given the UK is one of the two major military powers in Europe alongside France, means that we are going to be thrust together. Really, it's an inevitability, but it's also, I think, desirable,\" he said.\n\nStarmer is due to meet with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in May to review the Trade and Cooperation agreement struck after Brexit.","summary":"Struggling to gain traction at home after taking the top job, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's performance on the international stage has been received differently. ","url":"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-23/keir-starmer-polling-ukraine-us-russia-negotiations/105069030","image":"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/19febd7d1fe4f9381c307372661f2aab?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=2813&cropW=5000&xPos=0&yPos=380&width=862&height=485","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-22 18:51:32","author":"Patrick Martin","authors":["Patrick Martin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"AU","sentiment":0.105},{"id":303059934,"title":"Trump revokes security clearances of former opponents, including Kamala Harris, Hillary Clinton","text":"March 22 (UPI) -- President Donald Trump formally rescinded security clearances and access to classified information for 15 people, including former President Joe Biden, members of his family, Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris.\n\nThe list includes many that he considered political opponents.\n\n\"I have determined that it is no longer in the national interest for the following individuals to access classified information,\" Trump said in the memo released Friday night. \"I hereby direct every executive department and agency head to take all additional action as necessary and consistent with existing law to revoke any active security clearances held by the aforementioned individuals and to immediately rescind their access to classified information.\"\n\nThis applies to classified briefings and any access the individuals might have had to classified information.\n\nThose listed in Trump's memorandum have had their \"unescorted access to secure United States Government facilities\" rescinded.\n\nFriday's memo also applies to \"receipt of classified briefings, such as the President's Daily Brief, and access to classified information held by any member of the Intelligence Community by virtue of the named individuals' previous tenure in the Congress.\"\n\nBiden declined to extend that courtesy to Trump.

According to their analysis, Trump won among young white men and narrowly captured support from nonwhite men in the 18-year-old demographic.\"This is the thing I am the most shocked by in the last four years—that young people have gone from being the most progressive generation since the Baby Boomers... to becoming potentially the most conservative generation that we've experienced maybe in 50 to 60 years,\" Shor stated.The data also reveals an unprecedented 23-percentage-point gender gap among voters under 30, with young men significantly more likely to support Trump than young women. This polarization appears to be part of a global trend observed in several Western democracies.According to AP VoteCast analysis, President Trump won 47 percent of the 18-29 demographic in the 2024 election, up from 36 percent in 2020. AtlasIntel's February polling shows his approval rating in this age group has improved by nearly 23 percentage points since January.What People Are SayingDavid Shor, Democratic Pollster: \"I have to admit, I was one of those liberals four years ago, and it seems I was wrong. The future has a way of surprising us.\"Ezra Klein, New York Times Columnist: \"Democrats are getting destroyed now among young voters...

That is just completely false.\"David B. Cohen, Political Science Professor, told Newsweek in a 2024 interview: \"Young voters compose a crucial part of the Democratic base, and if that is eroding, where do they make up for that? Going forward, Democrats will have to figure out how to bring young voters back to the fold—particularly young men—if they want to be competitive nationally.\"What Happens NextThe White House may develop more targeted outreach to further solidify support among younger voters, while Democrats face the challenge of reconnecting with a pivotal demographic, they previously underestimated.","summary":"This challenges long-held Democratic Party assumptions about younger generations forming an \"ascendant majority\" that would secure their electoral future.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/democratic-pollster-shocked-gen-z-conservative-shift-2049107","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2612830/gen-z-trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-22 18:04:09","author":"Adeola Adeosun","authors":["Adeola Adeosun"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.466},{"id":303083166,"title":"Reid Hoffman: ‘Start using AI deeply. It is a huge intelligence amplifier’","text":"Reid Hoffman is a prominent Silicon Valley billionaire entrepreneur and investor known for co-founding the professional social networking site LinkedIn, now owned by Microsoft. He’s also staunchly anti-Trump. The longtime Democrat donor threw his support behind Kamala Harris in the race for the White House. Hoffman spoke to the Observer about technology in the new political milieu and his new book about our future with artificial intelligence, Superagency. The book, while not ignoring the problems that AI might cause, argues that the technology is poised to give us cognitive superpowers that will increase our individual and collective human agency, creating a state of widespread empowerment for society.\n\nYou have a vested interest in being positive about AI, including a company focused on conversational AI for business, Inflection AI. Why should we listen to you? First, an economic interest doesn’t necessarily make what someone is saying wrong, and I try to be transparent and not hide mine. Second, I tend to start with my beliefs and follow with my money. And sometimes that does mean doing things that are against my economic interests. Not kissing [Trump’s] ring, like many others have, is probably an economic limiter – but it’s better to be principled. I could have put the time and energy I spent writing Superagency into my companies and made much more money, but I want to share in the intellectual discourse.\n\nWhat’s your hope for the book? I want to at the very least make people AI-curious, so they begin to explore what these superpowers we all might be getting are. There’s a flood of discussion around AI that tends to be negative and concerns a decrease in human agency. And, while that is a common response to new technologies, in previous cases it hasn’t come to pass – human agency has increased – and I predict the AI revolution will land in the same place. But there is a turbulent transition. I am calling it the “cognitive Industrial Revolution” not only because of the anticipated superpowers and superagency we will gain, but because, like the Industrial Revolution, the transition will be difficult. We can get through it with less pain and more grace, as well as improve the state that we’re moving towards, if we use a techno-humanist compass that points us towards building technologies that increase human agency.\n\nYou argue that AI chatbots such as ChatGPT have been a turning point in increasing human agency because, compared with AI technologies such as facial recognition, predictive policing and algorithmic surveillance, they work us and us rather than us and we must affirmatively choose to use them. But they can still guide us towards certain viewpoints, numb our critical thinking and, of course, potentially upend our jobs – which would seem to undermine human agency. To take jobs, they are being transformed, and information professionals will need to be using AI tools to do part of their work. If you don’t you will be under-tooled and won’t be competitive. And you may feel that as a loss of agency. You don’t want to change but you can’t choose not to. But then you begin to see the upside: repetitive tasks might be automated, creative processes accelerated. You get a lot more agency and so do other people.\n\nSo we won’t all become obsolete? I do believe AI will primarily still end up being a co-pilot, though obviously some job types will disappear. We will need to build technologies that can help people whose jobs are changing adapt or, if the job does completely goes away, find other jobs that they can learn and possibly do with AI.\n\nYou label those who fret about AI’s near-term risks and harms as “gloomers” – but isn’t it important to be critical of new technology? Yes, but where the implication is we should stop or massively slow down – it isn’t helpful. Not least because the countries that adopt the cognitive Industrial Revolution early and firmly will win massive amounts of economic strength, and their values will end up shaping the world. I want western democracies to get there ahead of others like China that are trying to embrace it through autocracy.\n\nYou get to the good future by steering towards it. Not that you don’t pay attention to the bad futures – but you do so as you’re figuring out how to navigate the right way. You adopt an iterative deployment stance – testing deliberately incremental versions en masse in the real world and then looking at where the critiques play and adjusting (which is how OpenAI has rolled out ChatGPT).\n\nWhere’s the leadership among wealthy Democrats against Trump? Or are people lying low fearing political retribution, which you have said you are worried about? Personally, I am regrouping. The point, for me, isn’t fighting Trump. It is helping humanity and making society better, including American society. And you might say that because this administration is not going to listen to my ideas about what the government should be doing on AI, maybe I should focus on contributing elsewhere. I recently launched Manas AI, centred on discovering drugs to cure cancer, and I also recently became a fellow of the London School of Economics, helping them think about how AI reinvents the university.\n\nThat said, obviously I’ve been dismayed and deeply concerned about various things that have happened since Trump took office, including seemingly allying with Russia and Putin and standing down our offensive cyber operations.\n\nYou are among the few tech moguls who haven’t cosied up to President Trump. What should we conclude about the morality of this industry as it rolls back DEI (diversity) initiatives and drops factchecking, as Meta has done? I do have some quieter friends! The technology industry should be in dialogue and taking some of its cues from a government elected by democratic vote. The fact that you don’t happen to like this government doesn’t negate that. But, on the other hand, there are things being done that are, frankly, bad for society. While one could easily argue some DEI initiatives have gone too far and it’s good to adjust them, some of DEI is civil rights – which, unequivocally, it is good to be for.\n\nI obviously disagree with some of the moves that have been made to remove factchecking. We have anti-vax claims in various social networking platforms that are pretty easily false and a double-digit percentage of Americans who believe various vaccine-related conspiracy theories. That kind of level of disinformation within society makes it hard for democracies to operate. LinkedIn gets criticised as boring – but it exemplifies a lot of what I think should be happening on social networks around factchecking.\n\nHow worrying has it been to watch the “move fast and break things” tech approach being applied to the US federal government by Doge [Elon Musk’s department of government effeciency], in some cases reportedly using AI software to identify budget cuts? I expect most business people, including myself, would think that figuring out how to make government more efficient is a good goal. But you can do it in a way that’s less destructive, less cruel and more lawful than is being done. Firing all these experts and then trying to rehire them: it is a hot mess of incompetent behaviour. Even doing it hard and fast, there are ways – they could have asked for memos about the programmes they were thinking of cutting. The “I’ll just cancel all of it and then we’ll see what happens” is a path that comes with massive external costs.\n\nYou and Elon Musk used to be friends. But he has accused you and continues to repeat the accusation that you were one of Jeffrey Epstein’s clients – which you have said is “slander and a lie” and that your only involvement with Epstein, which you have apologised for, was in helping the MIT Media Lab fundraise. Any plans to take legal action? I have yet to ever personally bring a lawsuit. I tend to be a builder and a maker and legal action of this sort is very difficult in the US. I have thought about also calling for the Epstein files to be released to bring out the truth. But then do I really want to get into that tar pit? I question Elon’s motives for saying these things given now he’s in government. I think he is trying to smear me to try to make my voice less relevant to the American people.\n\nHow do you AI-proof yourself? What’s your advice to a young adult thinking about a career path? I don’t think it is AI-proofing yourself; it is AI-amplifying yourself. The important thing is to be engaging with AI and learning the tools. And young people have a real advantage: because they are interested in and tend to adopt new technologies readily, they can bring a skill set and mindset to the workplace that can help the workplace transform.\n\nYour previous book, , is described as written “by Reid Hoffman with ChatGPT-4” and it documents your conversations with the chatbot. To what extent did you use AI to write this book? While [my co-author and I] feel we own every word here, we used it a lot! For research, to give us the pros and cons of what we were arguing in various sections, and to suggest rewrites of paragraphs to give them more zing. My recommendation to all writers is to start using AI deeply. It is a huge intelligence amplifier. And I don’t think it is necessary the way we used it – which wasn’t wholesale quoting – to say “written with AI”. It is would be like saying “written with a Mac”.\n\nHow should we regulate AI? Biden’s 2023 executive order, which was the closest the US had to any federal AI regulation and was aimed at trying to reduce its risks, has been rescinded by Trump, who described it as a barrier to American AI innovation. Regulation should be iterative – like deployment. So certainly, regulation as we go and even some regulation now. The Biden executive order was directionally right, meant as it was to tackle major harms rather than any harm you could think of, and hopefully it is just cancelled in name. But it isn’t just regulation. Feedback from customers, employees, the public are all part of steering the path here. And benchmarks and metrics can be important too as a non-legally binding way of shelving algorithms that perform poorly.\n\nAre we going to end up with chatbots built on partisan large language models (LLMs) that steer clear of truth and reinforce our own worldviews? Obviously, it’s not good for us to be in complete filter bubbles. And I think you will get some of that with some LLMs. I am a fan of identifying the principles you are training your LLM on and then articulating a reasoned argument for that. So: I’m the “anti-woke” LLM because I believe this, this and this, or I’m an LLM that will let you know when there’s a big swath of people who disagree with you because I think it is important for you to be informed. Then people will know what they are using.\n\nIs technologists’ holy grail of reaching artificial general intelligence (AGI) – in which AI can perform any intellectual task that a human can and which many expect will be achieved before the end of the decade – needed for the cognitive Industrial Revolution? Not necessarily, although it would be an even further amplification. LLMs today are enabling us to do things that no human being can do, in terms of the breadth of knowledge, and bringing things together. I do think that within three years the tools will be good enough that, if you’re not using them, it will be like a professional not having a mobile phone. But whether we are talking about AGI or even artificial super intelligence (ASI) [greatly exceeding human cognitive abilities], and which I think is at least decades away, we should try to shape them in a way that’s good for us and good for society. Let’s make sure ASIs are essentially Buddhist in their values.\n\n Superagency: What Could Possibly Go Right With Our AI Future? by Reid Hoffman and Greg Beato is published by Authors Equity (£22).

They want somebody else in there. What do you say about that? [People] in your own party saying ‘You gots to go.’”\n\nYes, this is the same King who once vacationed with the Obamas in Tahiti while portraying herself as a serious journalist.\n\nSo while Schumer was being humiliated on national television, one of the few Democrats to vote with him, Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA), assessed the current state of the party.\n\nAnd the analogy is perfect.\n\n“A sad cavalcade of self-owns and unhinged petulance,” Fetterman said. “It only makes Trump look more presidential and restrained. We’re becoming the metaphorical car alarms that nobody pays attention to — and it may not be the winning message.”\n\nA recent NBC News poll underscores just how poorly the party is perceived: Just 7% of all voters have a “very positive” view of the party. Cancer may be more popular.\n\nThe car alarm Fetterman is referring to might as well be called the Elon Musk alarm. It seems the latest genius idea some Democrats are running with is to encourage violence and potentially deadly acts against Tesla dealerships across the country, all while celebrating Tesla stock plunging as a result of liberals revolting against the top electric car company they once embraced for helping to save the planet.\n\nEnter Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN), the 2024 vice presidential nominee, who is on what comes across as a standup comedy tour.\n\n“On the iPhone, they’ve got that little stock app. I added Tesla to it to give me a little boost during the day. [The price is] $225 and dropping!” a gleeful Walz said in a recent speech to uproarious laughter from the audience. “And if you own one, we’re not blaming you. You can take dental floss and pull the Tesla [logo] off,” he continued.\n\nYes, that’s right: The guy who was almost a heartbeat away from the presidency is celebrating the value of America’s seventh-largest company falling. If it leads to some of Tesla’s 125,000-plus employees being laid off, so be it.\n\nIt’s hard to overstate just how vapid Walz is. Because according to Fox News national correspondent Bill Melugin, it’s not in his state’s best interest to root against Tesla for a cheap laugh.\n\n“As Gov. Walz gloats about Tesla stock dropping, records from the Minnesota State Board of Investment show that as of 6/30/24, the state of Minnesota had 1.6 million shares of Tesla in its retirement fund, and 211,000 shares of Tesla in its non-retirement fund,” Melugin reported.\n\nYou can’t make this stuff up.\n\nLate-night “comedians” are also getting into the act. Enter Jimmy Kimmel of ABC, who explained Wednesday night that domestic terrorism at Tesla dealerships has included scores of cars being set on fire, Molotov cocktails being thrown at showrooms, and gunshots being fired at windows. Well, that’s all justified because of the Department of Government Efficiency cuts Musk is recommending as he roots out waste, fraud, and abuse in the federal government.\n\nIn a recent interview with Sean Hannity, Musk speculated that Teslas were being vandalized because of “some kind of mental illness thing going on here.” He’s right about that, but Kimmel says it’s because of Musk’s actions with DOGE that justify overt domestic terrorism.\n\n“Well, let me see if I can explain it for you,” Kimmel told Musk, “When you pull out a chain saw to celebrate firing thousands of people, they get mad.”\n\n“Please … don’t vandalize, don’t EVER vandalize Tesla vehicles,” he sarcastically said in another monologue, clearly implying it was OK.\n\nWe’re a long way from Johnny Carson.\n\nThe clip went so viral that Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) openly asked ABC if any reprimand was coming.\n\n“Does ABC approve of Jimmy Kimmel’s on-air incitement of criminal behavior?” Lee asked. “Will ABC take any action or make any statement in response to it? If not, why not?”\n\nGood question.\n\nA recent CNN poll shows that the extremes are winning. When asking Democratic voters which figure best represents the party, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) clocked in first, with former Vice President Kamala Harris, once seen as the most liberal senator in the country, finishing a close second. Socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) was third, followed by House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY), a 2016 election denier.\n\nThe ubiquitous Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-TX) tied former President Barack Obama, who could almost pass for a centrist in the Democratic Party at this point.\n\nThis week, Crockett declared that all she wants for her birthday on March 29 is for “Elon [Musk] to be taken down.”\n\nConsidering there were two attempts on Trump’s life last summer, rhetoric involving political opponents being “taken down” has no place anywhere, especially among elected lawmakers. But instead of party leaders instructing attention-seekers to take a seat and stay off TV and social media for the near future while the party continues to tank, Democrats are only moving more to the left.\n\nThe latest example is a barnstorming tour through red states featuring Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders. Because nothing speaks better to working-class people than two self-described “democratic socialists” saying they’ll fight for them and their families by doing everything possible to shut down the government.\n\n“We need a Democratic Party that fights harder for us!” Ocasio-Cortez exclaimed at a rally in Arizona.\n\nThis prompted Fetterman to respond thusly on X: “Fight ‘harder’— a stunt that would have harmed millions and plunged us into chaos. We kept our government open. Deal with it.”\n\nAnd he’s right. It seems the only things that Democrats are fighting for are government shutdowns, American companies to fail, Teslas to burn, men to compete against women in sports, illegal immigrant gang members and pro-Hamas green-card holders not to be deported, and Ukraine and Russia to be in a perpetual stalemate.\n\nQuinnipiac University’s annual first-quarter congressional polling shows that for the first time in the poll’s history, Democrats in Congress have higher disapproval numbers than approval among their own voters, with just 40% of Democratic voters approving. Last year, 75% approved while only 21% disapproved, a stunning reversal.\n\nPerhaps not having a presidential primary and installing Harris has Democratic voters upset.\n\nPerhaps it’s the fact that despite suffering huge losses in 2024, with the GOP now controlling the White House, Senate, and House of Representatives, leadership remains the same. Schumer is still leading Senate Democrats, and Jeffries still runs Democrats in the House.\n\nJust as it occurred in 2009 as pundits wondered if the GOP was only a regional party that couldn’t win elections again, Democrats need their own Tea Party movement. But they also need a clear issue to own that is also popular among its voters and hammer home solutions.\n\nRight now, it’s as clear as mud as to what that unifying message is outside of “Trump and Elon are oligarchs!”\n\nAs a result, the civil war continues between a shrinking centrist wing and a louder far-left wing.\n\nAnd the left wing is winning right now, much to the delight of Trump and the Republicans.","summary":"The push to drive Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) into taking a permanent vacation is very real after the New York Democrat wisely decided to vote with Republicans on a continuing resolution spending bill last week.

With dates already booked in nearby New York, some weren’t sure Williams could fill the Prudential Center. \n\n“They weren’t even going to make 300 popcorn buckets,” he said. \n\nBut the comedian immediately expressed his gratitude to the raucous crowd.\n\nWilliams’s 2024 Netflix special, “Woke Foke,” was met with mixed reactions from fans. Perhaps Williams got locked into the high of the podcast appearance so much, he felt the need to retool jokes and observations around it.\n\nHis Newark routine was an abbreviated epilogue to the fallout of “Club Shay Shay” and his Netflix special. Legendary comedian and actress Monique served as the MC, regularly working the crowd between sets and hilariously quizzing them about sex acts and the effects of edibles. \n\nReferencing his previous work — and the resulting controversies around his bold and sometimes bizarre claims about Hollywood, Williams declared to the audience that he was there to report his findings from “infiltrating the Illuminati.” \n\nThe comedian used his stage, accented with a giant LED screen in the back, as a canvas to paint broad strokes on affirmations, the political tumult of 2025, and the enemies he’s making in Hollywood throughout his “era of truth,” as he referred to it in an interview with GQ.\n\nIt’s not so much that Williams had any more axes to grind, but that he is gleefully burning bridges in celebrity circles. He spoke about Jamie Foxx and “loving him and his clone,” referring to his joke about Foxx’s having a mysterious illness in his 2024 special.\n\nWilliams expressed disappointment at Mike Tyson‘s boxing loss to Jake Paul (complete with showing an infamous picture of the former boxer in the locker room before the fight). There were also smaller jokes sent the way of Dave Chappelle (whom Williams says won’t be friends with him anymore), 50 Cent (he’s confused why he’s mad at him in the first place), and Cedric The Entertainer. \n\nThe laundry list brought out laughs from the crowd as the set went in rapid succession.\n\nIt’s as if Williams tailored his set to those who came to see his responses to the viral proclamations about the industry one year later. \n\nHere’s a man whose impeccable comedic timing, hyperactive mind and southern drawl have led to a successful acting and stand-up career, complete with 13 specials. \n\nBut now Williams is speaking out about the excesses of Hollywood, drawing headlines with long monologues that veer into conspiracy theory and theology. \n\nThis isn’t to say Williams’s routine wasn’t structured. The comedian’s punchlines centered around affirmations for 2025 and a joke after that.\n\nFor example, Williams proclaimed to the crowd that in 2025, you are one change away from everything going better for you. Sometimes, that might mean changing your name. From there, he flipped it into a brief story about the spice Paprika and how it’s made from crushed bell peppers. Is the name “crushed bell peppers” enticing? Not really, and that was his point. \n\nAs a segue, Williams then moved to the political spectrum. The comedian pointed to former vice president Kamala Harris’s failed presidential bid, saying, “She didn’t win enough Electoral College votes to graduate.” \n\nWilliams’s observations surrounding President Donald Trump (or whom he called Trump Vader) saying it could be a robot due to his “Peter Griffith-like” reaction to his assassination attempt over the summer and the rash of directives he’s done in his second administration, including the executive order seeking to disband the Department of Education. \n\n“They said the kids can’t read,” Williams told the crowd. “Trump said, ‘Let’s get rid of books!‘” \n\nSome of the funniest moments of the special were when Williams observed the security guards in the crowd. Prudential Center had a strict no-phone usage policy, and people in the audience still tried to use them anyway. Security not only had to combat that with strong flashlight-assisted warnings, but Williams also made a note of all the marijuana usage and the difficulties of trying to track it.\n\nAt the end of Williams’s set, it felt like the comedian had finally started to settle in. However, the crowd could tell he was beginning to wrap up as he moved his golden mic stand to the front of the stage. \n\n“We love you, Katt!” a fan from the front row yelled as Williams acknowledged. In his 34-year career as a comedian, Williams is living in many moments (good and bad) where he’s captured the view of pop culture. \n\nRight now, it feels like he’s splitting time between his classic comedic stylings and riding the wave of his “era of truth” — no matter what. \n\nRelated coverage:\n\n10 years of ‘Emo Night’: How millennial nostalgia bled into Gen-Z one mosh pit at a timeHow Nina Simone’s grandson brought Black music back to Asbury ParkIconic metal band’s singer suing over mold in home he rented, is not down with the sicknessPopular rapper retires from music, will ‘never sing again’ after grandmother’s deathPolarizing rock star always ‘puts his foot in his mouth,’ iconic guitarist says\n\nOur journalism needs your support.

increased friction with longtime European allies.\"I mean, obviously most of the actions, and most of the gestures, tend to be the — when you come over to Europe and say, it's an America, not just America first, it's an America-only kind of position, that obviously breaks alliances,\" Hoffman said. \"And gets people to think about like, 'Well, who else should I potentially ally with?'\"Hoffman said he believes that if the country neglects diplomacy, international rivals to US-based companies become increasingly better-positioned to siphon business from estranged customers.\"And so having all these discussions with people about like, OK, what kind of technologists here say, 'Well, I'd rather buy a BYD car than a Tesla,'\" Hoffman said. \"One is kind of saying, 'Hey, I'm just trying to

the country itself can be reliable.\"Part of what I'm trying to do here is persuade folks that the US actually, in fact, can be a continuing stable partner, despite randomness of tariffs and things,\"

several officials from the previous administration of Joe Biden and members of the former president's family.\n\nThe memorandum, released on Friday, follows Trump’s announcement in February that he is “immediately” rescinding Biden’s access to classified data and stopping the former president’s daily intelligence briefings.\n\nThe document formalizes the revocation of the security clearance for Biden, the members of his family, and several other former officials, who had previously been mentioned by the White House in this context.\n\nAmong the more than dozen people affected by the measure are former Secretary of State Antony Blinken, former National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, former Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco and two former Republican representatives who were on the House committee investigating Trump’s alleged role in the January 6 Capitol events, Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger.\n\nTrump said in the memorandum that he has “determined that it is no longer in the national interest for the following individuals to access classified information.”\n\nAccording to the president, he has told the heads of government agencies to take all necessary actions “to revoke any active security clearances held by the aforementioned individuals and to immediately rescind their access to classified information.”\n\nThis means that, among other things, Biden, Harris, Clinton and the others will not be able to obtain classified briefings – such as the President’s Daily Brief – or access classified information held by any member of the US intelligence community, the document explained.\n\nThey will also be barred from “unescorted access” to secure US government facilities, it added.\n\nSome American news outlets have described the move as an attack by the president on his political opponents.\n\nWhen announcing his decision to revoke Biden’s security clearance last month, Trump referenced the 2024 report by Special Counsel Robert Hur saying it had revealed that the former president suffers from “poor memory” and, even in his “prime,” could not be trusted with sensitive information.\n\nNBC News reported on Friday that 82-year-old Biden, who had

information, CNN reported.\n\nTrump instructed all relevant government agencies to take the necessary steps to revoke any active security clearances they held and to immediately block their access to classified materials.\n\nThe action also applied to individuals who had held positions in Congress, including several from previous administrations who had access to sensitive information during their tenures.\n\n“I have determined that it is no longer in the national interest for the following individuals to access classified information.\n\n“I hereby direct every executive department and agency head to take all additional action as necessary and consistent with existing law to revoke any active security clearances held by the aforementioned individuals and to immediately rescind their access

he stripped former President Joe Biden of his clearance and halted his daily intelligence briefings.\n\nAdditionally, the memo confirmed the cancellation of clearances for key figures involved in the investigation of the January 6, 2021, insurrection, including former Republican Representatives Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, who served on the House committee that investigated Trump’s role in the attack on the Capitol.\n\nAccording to CNN, earlier this month, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard confirmed that, in line with Trump’s directives, she had revoked security clearances for several individuals named in the memo.\n\nThis included top Biden administration officials such as former Secretary of State Antony Blinken and former National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, as well as prominent legal figures like New York Attorney General Letitia James and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, who have pursued legal actions against Trump.\n\nIn a separate memo issued the same

Polling shows approval of the party and its representatives in Congress at record lows.However, Sanders' and Ocasio-Cortez's efforts appears to be breaking through with many in the country. Thousands have turned out in multiple states to attend their rallies as part of the \"Fight the Oligarchy\" tour.What To KnowOn Thursday evening, Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez spoke to a crowd of some 15,000 in Phoenix, according to the senator's communications director Anna Bahr. Photos and videos from the event showed the Arizona State University's Mullett Arena packed, with the Arizona Mirror reporting that Trump's rally in the same facility last year \"drew considerably fewer people.\"\"What does MAGA think about this Crowd size for a Senator ands congresswoman? This is the energy democrats need,\" Brian Krassenstein, an online commentator with over 860,000 followers on X, formerly Twitter, wrote with a video of Ocasio-Cortez walking out on stage to a loudly cheering crowd.The clip had some 1.4 million views as of Saturday morning.Bahr wrote on X that \"more than 123,000 people\" also watched the Arizona event live online.\"Just to be clear about the moment we're in: @BernieSanders biggest crowd in Phoenix previously was 11,300 in 2015 when he was *running for president.* Tonight, in a non-campaign year, when he is running for nothing, **15,000** Arizonans turned out. This is a big deal,\" she posted.An even bigger crowd turned out for the duo's Friday rally at Denver's Civic Center Park. Colorado Public Radio reported some 34,000 were in attendance.\"Impressive! People are clearly angry at how things are going,\" Krassenstein wrote, sharing another video panning over the massive Colorado crowd.The clip had been viewed more than 790,000 times as of Saturday morning.Sanders, who caucuses with Senate Democrats and twice sought the party's presidential nomination in 2016 and 2020, announced in February that he'd be launching a national tour to \"take on the oligarchy.\" The senator, along with many Democrats, has sounded the alarm about Trump's and Musk's efforts to make significant cuts to the federal government via the newly created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).The Trump administration's defenders say these cuts are necessary to address waste and fraud in the federal government. They also raise concerns about the ballooning national debt, saying drastic action is needed to address the issue.\"In my opinion, what Musk and those around him are aggressively striving for is not novel. It is not complicated, and it is not new. It is what ruling classes throughout history have always wanted and have always believed is theirs by right: more power, more control and more wealth,\" Sanders said in a video announcing the tour. \"They don't want ordinary people—that's you—and democracy getting in their way.\"Sanders, 83, aims to visit \"working class\" districts that former President Joe Biden won in 2020, but Republican House members carried in 2024. The tour began on February 21 in Nebraska, and has continued with stops in Wisconsin and Michigan earlier this month.What People Are SayingSenator Bernie Sanders told the crowd in Colorado on Friday: \"In the hundreds of rallies that I have done, we have never, ever had a rally as large as this. And Denver, your presence here today is not just significant for Colorado. You are sending a profound message all over the world. The whole world is watching, and they want to know if the people of America are going to stand up to Trumpism, oligarchy and authoritarianism.\"Anna Bahr, Sanders' communications director on X: \"In 2016, @BernieSanders biggest crowd was 28,356 at Prospect Park, Brooklyn. He was running for president. In 2019, his largest crowd was 25,872 in Queensbridge Park, NY. He was running for president. Tonight, 34,000 people came out in Denver. He isn't running for anything.\"Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez at the Denver rally: \"I don't believe in health care, labor and human dignity because I'm an extremist. I believe these things because I was a waitress. Because I scrubbed toilets with my mom to afford school. Because I've worked double shifts to keep the lights on. Because I did lose my dad as a kid and had to see my mom open the hospital bills a few days later, and I don't want us to live like this anymore. We deserve better.\"What Happens Next?The senator and congresswoman will hold another rally on Saturday afternoon in Tucson, Arizona.Ocasio-Cortez, 35, is touted by some Democrats as a potential 2028 presidential candidate.Recent polling by CNN showed the New York progressive in first place among potential 2028 Democratic candidates with 10 percent support. Former Vice President Kamala Harris, who lost to Trump last year, was in second place with 9 percent. Sanders came in third place with 8 percent support.","summary":"\"We have never, ever had a rally as large as this,\" Sanders told a crowd in Denver on

The season finale, which aired this month, saw two engaged couples call off their weddings—reportedly over their differing political views, as mentioned in a report by Politico.The influence of US President Donald Trump on romantic relationships became a central talking point, sparking widespread debate among fans and political commentators alike.The issue of politics creeping into relationships is not new, but the show's dramatic unraveling of engagements highlighted how ideological differences are increasingly shaping personal connections. With the 2024 presidential election looming, the cultural and political divide in the United States appears to have left its mark on the reality dating scene as well.A Reflection of Broader Political TrendsThe season, filmed a year ago, seemed to foreshadow the political divides shaping voter demographics. Polls indicated that young women overwhelmingly supported Vice President Kamala Harris over Trump, while a significant segment of young men aligned with the former president. Love Is Blind provided a microcosm of this divide, illustrating how politics has become more than just an ideological stance—it has become a core part of personal identity.Avoidance or Apathy?While political disagreements played a role in the breakups, the primary issue appeared to be the men’s reluctance to engage in political discourse, as per the Politico report.Sara Carton, an oncology nurse, and Ben Mezzenga, a sales executive, initially bonded over shared interests. However, Sara later expressed frustration at Ben’s indifference to political issues. When she asked about topics like Black Lives Matter and LGBTQ+ rights, Ben’s vague responses suggested a lack of awareness or engagement. His reluctance to discuss social issues ultimately led Sara to question their compatibility.A similar dynamic unfolded between Virginia Miller, a healthcare recruiter, and Devin Buckley, a high school basketball coach. When Virginia casually brought up politics in conversation, Devin admitted he had never given it much thought. His avoidance of the topic made Virginia reconsider their future together, leading her to call off the wedding.FAQsIs anybody from Love Is Blind still together?Amy Cortés and Johnny McIntyre are the Love Is Blind couple, who are still going strong, first met during the show's sixth season, which aired in the spring 2024. They quickly formed a deep connection in the pods and became the first pair to get engaged.Do Love Is Blind couples get paid?While participants explore whether love is truly blind, they aren't doing it without compensation.

According to the New Hampshire Campaign for Voting Rights, at least 56 people who tried to register statewide the day of the March 11 town elections were turned away, though it is unknown how many of them later completed the process.\n\nDerry’s town clerk, Tina Guilford, wonders how it will go during a November general election, when turnout is much higher.\n\n“It’s just heartbreaking to me to see people turn around and think, ‘I hope they come back,’” she said.\n\nAt least one person who tried to register in Milford on Tuesday did not return, said Joan Dargie, the town clerk.

Katie Porter certainly didn’t wait for former Vice President Kamala Harris to decide whether she, too, wants to run for California governor in 2026.\n\nBut Porter, in recently declaring her candidacy to replace term-limited Gov. Gavin Newsom, has put a bit of an asterisk next to her campaign.\n\nShould Harris decide to enter the race, Porter would bow out, her spokesperson has said.\n\nPorter is laying out her cards.\n\n“If Kamala comes into this race — especially if she comes in tomorrow, she comes in now — it’s going to have a near field-clearing effect,” Porter said on a recent episode of the “Pod Save America” podcast.\n\nIt would be “disrespectful,” Porter said when pressed on why she’s willing to defer to Harris rather than run a campaign regardless, not to acknowledge that the 2024 Democratic presidential nominee “would be an incredibly strong candidate.”\n\nMeanwhile, other candidates are ignoring the Harris-of-it-all shadow cast on the already-crowded field for governor.\n\nFormer Assembly Speaker and Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, for instance, said a theoretical Harris entry doesn’t matter. He’s in it to win it, he said during a recent event at the UC Student and Policy Center in Sacramento.\n\nSo what’s the better campaign strategy for the field of Democrats, a group that, as of now, includes legislative leaders, members of the state’s executive branch and a former congressional representative?\n\nDefer to the person who led your party in the recent presential election?\n\nOr fight for pole position, convince voters that no matter who else runs, you’re the best one for the job?\n\nIt’s politics, so predicting just which approach is the most politically savvy strategy may be a fool’s errand this early in the race.\n\nStill, it could prove to be a defining moment for Democrats, said Matt Lesenyie, who teaches political science at Cal State Long Beach, with a focus on political psychology and messaging.\n\nLikening it to an actual horse race, Lesenyie said the Democratic Party — and to some extent, Republicans, too — have struggled because they have not had their top candidates really go toe-to-toe with one another.\n\n“Their thoroughbreds haven’t actually had to run a race until it was too late,” he said. “(Former President) Joe Biden is a quality candidate but probably should have had another runner-up against him in the primary to show he still has it or he doesn’t.”\n\nBut certainly when you have a race oversaturated with quality candidates, most of them are going to take a foreseeable loss, Lesenyie said.\n\nSo some candidates may need to decide if they’d gain more by going up against a candidate like Harris — or if they can afford another loss on their record.\n\n“There’s an unwritten rule: You can only lose two races and continue on with your political career,” Lesenyie said. “Voters can sour on you because you’re a two-time loser. You may be a winner other times, but you’ve picked the wrong fights.”\n\nAnd then there’s the fundraising aspect. Lose too many races and donors may keep their wallets closed.\n\nIn that sense, “it may end up looking like either getting all the way in or staying out until Harris should decide might have been more plausible strategies,” said Dan Schnur, who teaches political messaging at USC and UC Berkeley.\n\nSchnur said a defer-to-Harris strategy is “a puzzling approach.”\n\n“The message is essentially, ‘I’m the second-best person in California to be governor. Give me money just in case the person who is better than me doesn’t run.’ It’s hard to see how a lot of donors would contribute to a candidate who might not be in the race later this year,” Schnur said.\n\nHarris reportedly said she would decide by the end of summer whether she’s entering the race.\n\nIn the meantime, other Democratic candidates have been a bit less vocal about their plans.\n\nA spokesperson for Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis has said she remains committed on her gubernatorial bid. But Politico reported that Kounalakis, who is close to Harris, is also quietly considering running for state treasurer instead.\n\nState Superintendent Tony Thurmond told Politico “we’ll see” about his campaign’s future should Harris run, but also said he was not running for anything else.\n\nBusinessman Steven Cloobeck is not one of those candidates. He unequivocally said he does not care who else is running; he’s in the race because he believes “California is worth fighting for.” He accused the other Democratic candidates of being too focused on their own resumes and wanting to “force each other into the race” to see if they’d have a better chance of running elsewhere.\n\n“Those in office now have failed us,” he said. “They have not done the job or the work.”\n\nWhile Porter has taken that defer-to-Harris approach, she’s balancing it with still casting herself as the No. 1 person for the job.\n\nPorter’s campaign, in a recent fundraising email, of course, makes no mention of Harris. Instead, it acknowledged “this race won’t be a walk in the park” with so many contenders and propped the former congresswoman up as “a leader who is ready to go toe to toe with extremists.”\n\nAnd when pressed on the “Pod Save America” podcast if she thought she’d be a better chief executive for California than Harris, Porter said, “If I didn’t think I would be the best governor that California could have, I wouldn’t be in this race.”\n\nBut Schnur, at least, isn’t necessarily convinced it’s the right approach.\n\n“‘I’m in the race for now,’ is not a particularly compelling bumper sticker,” he said.","summary":"Former Rep.

They all will no longer have access to classified information – a courtesy typically offered to former presidents and some officials after they have left public service.\n\n“I have determined that it is no longer in the national interest for the following individuals to access classified information,” Trump wrote. He said he would also “direct all executive department and agency heads to revoke unescorted access to secure United States government facilities from these individuals”.\n\nEarlier this month, the director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, announced that she had revoked the clearances and blocked several of the people named in Trump’s memo, along with “the 51 signers of the Hunter Biden disinformation letter” – referring to former intelligence agency officials who asserted that the notorious Hunter Biden laptop, which was discovered before the 2020 election, was likely a Russian disinformation campaign.\n\nTrump’s decision to remove Biden from intelligence briefings is a counterstrike against his Democrat political opponent, who had banned Trump from accessing classified documents in 2021, saying the then ex-president could not be trusted because of his “erratic behavior”.\n\nEarlier this week, Trump announced he was pulling Secret Service protections for Biden’s children, Hunter and Ashley, “effective immediately”, after it was claimed that 18 agents had been assigned to the former president’s son for a trip to South Africa and 13 to daughter Ashley.\n\nMore broadly, the security-clearance revocations issued on Friday appear to correlate with a cherrypicked list of the president’s political enemies, including the New York attorney general, Letitia James, and the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin Bragg, both of whom prosecuted Trump during the Biden era.\n\nOthers on the list include Fiona Hill, a foreign policy expert who testified against Trump during his first impeachment about her boss’s alleged scheme to withhold military aid to Ukraine as a way of pressuring its president to investigate the Bidens; Alexander Vindman, a lieutenant colonel who also testified at the hearings; and Norman Eisen, a lawyer who oversaw that impeachment.\n\nLiz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, Republicans who served on the committee investigating the January 6 US Capitol riots, were also added to the list. Trump said the information ban “includes, but is not limited to, receipt of classified briefings, such as the President’s daily brief, and access to classified information held by any member of the intelligence community”.\n\nThe move comes as NBC News reported that former president Biden and and his wife, Jill Biden, had volunteered to help fundraise for and help to rebuild the Democratic party after the stinging defeat of Biden’s nominated successor, Kamala Harris, in November.\n\nAccording to the network, Biden made the proffer last month when he met the new Democratic National Committee chair, Ken Martin, but the offer had not been embraced.\n\nAn NBC News poll published last weekend found the Democratic party’s popularity has dropped to a record low – only 27% of registered voters said they held positive views of the party. On Friday, Trump was asked about the prospect of Biden re-entering the political arena. “I hope so,” he responded.","summary":"In Friday memo, president also pulls clearances for Antony Blinken, Liz Cheney, Adam Kinzinger and Letitia James\n\nDonald Trump moved to revoke security clearances for Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and a string of other top Democrats and political enemies in a presidential memo issued late on Friday.\n\nThe security-clearance revocations also cover the former secretary of state Antony Blinken, the former Wyoming representative Liz Cheney, the former Illinois representative Adam Kinzinger and the New York attorney general, Letitia James, who prosecuted Trump for fraud, as well as Biden’s entire family.

And as President Donald Trump returns to Pennsylvania, keystone of his swing state sweep, it's no surprise it is happening at the NCAA wrestling championship. Like Eagles head coach Nick Siriani, Trump looked finished just a few years ago. But just as the Birds eventually held aloft the Lombardi Trophy, Trump returns to Philly in triumph. SCOOP: Rep. JIM JORDAN TO JOIN TRUMP AT NCAA MEN'S WRESTLING CHAMPIONSHIPS The hotels and restaurants of Center City were full of wrestling families this week, and at the elite Division I level, the wrestlers, coaches, and even the dads, in most cases, looked like squat, solid, muscular types who you could break a cinder block on. I joked with one of the coaches that in high school in Philly I played basketball and we all stayed away from the wrestlers, because, \"once they get you on the ground, forget about it.\" He assured me, \"Yeah, it's still like that.\" Saturday’s appearance at the finals of the grappling tournament is extremely smart politics from the White House. As with all of Trump's regular appearances at combat sports events, Trump was guaranteed a yuge ovation, but this time in one of the bluest cities in America. Now, a cynic might point out that most in attendance at the event are not from Philly, and that’s true. But on the other hand, Penn State blue and white was everywhere in town this week, as that university is the absolute powerhouse of the sport. Columnist Salena Zito, who has forgotten more about non-Philly Pennsylvania than most people will ever know, put it this way in describing the usual scene at Bloomsburg High School, where now Sen. Dave McCormick was a star on the mat: \"Wrestling here is everything, and all you have to do is just try to go to a wrestling match here and try to find a place to stand, let alone to sit,\" she said. It’s true, Philly is known for the Big 5 basketball colleges, for Wilt Chamberlain and Temple’s match-up zone. But in the rest of the state, it is wrestling and football that are kings. I was more careful than usual about bringing up politics. After all these families had spent thousands of dollars to come to Philly to talk about wrestling, not to appear on the \"McLaughlin Group.\" But when I did ask if they were excited the president was coming, everyone enthusiastically said yes. \"It’s really an honor for the boys,\" one Iowa wrestling mom told me. There was no need to ask where anyone was from, it was emblazoned all over their clothing. What I learned about wrestling at its highest level in those chats kind of explained why Trump is popular among the sport’s athletes and enthusiasts. These wrestlers are arguably the best and hardest-working athletes in America. The ancient Greeks certainly would have thought so. Yet there is no professional draft day when they are plied with millions of dollars. These guys are in the gym 15 times a day because they love it, even if they aren’t allowed to wear garbage bags to make weight anymore. And that is exactly the kind of hard work and dedication that many Trump voters see in the president. Back in October, I wrote in these pages that Philadelphia was Kamala Harris’ Alamo, the one place where she could make a stand in a state she was clearly losing, even if the polling couldn’t quite see it. Right now, it is hard to see how the hatred, and let’s be honest, it is mostly from the left, can be tamped down to allow Americans who love or hate Trump to hang out in peace and harmony. She won the City of Brotherly Love because, as Nancy Pelosi once put it, a glass of water with a D after its name would win in Philly. But Harris didn't win by nearly enough to make up for the heavy losses in the rest of the commonwealth. Just as during the election, there is a strong divide between Trump-hating Philly and the rest of the state where he has strong support, and if anything, that divide is growing sharper and more pointed. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Until recently, the divide in America had separated those who thought Trump was effective, if a bit over the top, and those who worried he’d be an authoritarian. Today, it is between people who think Trump is a great president, full stop, and those who truly believe he has already become a dictator. That is a far, far, greater gulf, and it explains the anger and violence we have increasingly seen. Every once in a while in high school, there would be a party, or an event, and the wrestlers were there along with the ballets, and under the right circumstances, we could tolerate, or even enjoy each other’s company.

Although he is not the first U.S. President to hear gunshots during a crowded rally, he sure was lucky enough to dodge the bullet as it just grazed his right ear. However, it still left him with a wound, and the Republican leader says that his ear “still throbs” to this day. \n\nThe perpetrator, 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, took his shot at Trump from a nearby rooftop, carrying an AR-15-style rifle. While the President, at that time the Republican Party nominee, was lucky enough to live, the bullets killed one attendee and critically injured two others at the Pennsylvania rally that day. Later, he was gunned down by a Secret Service counter-sniper team.\n\nAlmost a year later, more details about the chaos have been revealed, seemingly indicating how the assassination attempt played a role in his victory in the 2024 Presidential election. Alex Isenstadt, in his new book, Revenge: The Inside Story of Trump’s Return to Power, describes the backstage scenario of Trump and his team’s election campaign, along with more insights into the shocking assassination attempt at Butler.\n\nThe journalist explains how Donald Trump ducked behind the podium. As crooks continued to fire eight rounds, the Secret Service agents shielded him. In particular, Sean Curran’s move was applaudable, as he threw himself over Trump just to protect him from what could have put his life in immense danger.\n\n “It was chaos. Rally-goers behind Trump – some of whom just moments before were holding placards reading ‘Joe Biden: You’re Fired!’ – cowered. The agents were talking to one another, trying to figure out what was next.” Alex next describes how, despite having just been shot in his right ear, Trump told the agents, “Let me get my shoes.”\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by President Donald J. Trump (@realdonaldtrump) \n\n“Trump’s shoes had slipped off during the maelstrom. The former President had as of late been wearing shoes made by the Swiss manufacturer Bally. While the shoes were designed to be tied on, Trump had turned them into slip-ons. Trump appeared to search for them, and then stood up, looking as if he were in shock,“ Alex writes.\n\nMerely minutes later, Donald Trump pumped his fist and shouted three times, “Fight, fight, fight!“ a moment in history. While most of these were captured on camera, Isensdat provides what happened after the attempt on his life. He writes, “The detail guided Trump offstage, his typically immaculately sprayed gold hair out of place and his bloodied MAGA hat in hand. Descending the stairs, he wrapped his arms around an agent to his right. The loyal Curran was on his left.”\n\n𝐓𝐫𝐮𝐦𝐩 𝐀𝐬𝐬𝐚𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐀𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐦𝐩𝐭:\n8 bullets fired at President Trump, killing one bystander, and leaving Trump with an injury to his face.\nThe former President could be seen ducking as the crowd screamed as a shooter fired from a rooftop at the rally in… pic.twitter.com/DpcTwLmNl7\n— Oli London (@OliLondonTV) July 14, 2024 \n\nAlex further explains that it took the Secret Service agent some twenty seconds to get Donald Trump inside his SUV and that the then-Republican nominee raised his arm once more. The emergency situation further unfolded when Trump was escorted to the Butler Memorial Hospital. \n\n“Wiles, Cheung, Scavino, and Nauta headed for the emergency room. The building was going into lockdown. Secret Service agents had their long guns out; nurses were wheeling patients out of units so they could create a secure wing for Trump,“ the journalist unveiled. He continued that Donald Trump was then stretched into the emergency room. He got rid of his bloody hat, white collared shirt, and suit jacket, only wearing his pants and undershirt.\n\nHowever, in the end, the shoes he was first looking for were left on site and later retrieved and brought to the hospital. The next few moments were extremely intense. While Trump was taken into a separate room, phones flooded with calls and texts from media outlets asking for an update. One network also claimed that he had passed away, which his team quickly refuted, confirming he was “fine.“ Even in that moment, he couldn’t help but take a jab at Joe Biden. As Alex reveals, he asked a nurse, “Can you give me a copy of these [CT scan reports]? Because I want to make sure I can show reporters that my cognitive function is 100 percent. You can’t say the same about Joe Biden.\n\nHe also kept up his spirit throughout. In his book, the journalist elaborates how he exclaimed “Wow, that’s iconic. That’s the most American picture I’ve ever seen,“ after having a look at the photos from the attack. He also said, “This is going to make some news,“ and joked “This is going into the museum,“ after getting back his bloodied clothes.\n\nHowever, his injury wasn’t extremely serious as Donald Trump didn’t require extensive medical treatment. Shortly after the assassination attempt, he was discharged from the hospital and later went on to win a glorious victory against his Democratic rival Kamala Harris.","summary":"After the failed assassination attempt of Donald Trump, chaos ensued at the Butler Memorial Hospital.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/reporter-reveals-the-first-thing-donald-trump-told-secret-service-agents-after-being-shot","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Attempted-Assassination-of-Donald-Trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-22 13:49:35","author":"Moupriya","authors":["Moupriya"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.531},{"id":302993826,"title":"'Chaos and confusion': How Democrats infiltrated 'thunderous' GOP town halls","text":"Large campaign rallies and town halls are pillars of election year politics, but two months into President Donald Trump's second term, town halls are erupting across the country. While Republicans have largely been told to stay home, Democrats seem to be driving the narrative for the first time since Trump returned to the White House. Democrats last week launched a coordinated effort to host \"People’s Town Halls\" in all 50 states after disruptive protests led Republican leadership to advise against hosting in-person town halls. The first week of town halls brought a new wave of political drama and engagement resembling that of an election year. \"When folks get out of the DC bubble and into communities across the country, there is one undeniably clear trend emerging: Americans are feeling betrayed by Republicans. Across party lines, people are furious that their lives, jobs, retirement, and health care are being cast aside to enrich the already ultra-wealthy. The reception to the People’s Town Halls has been thunderous — and we’re keeping them going through all 50 states. Americans want to be heard and Democrats are listening,\" DNC Chair Ken Martin told Fox News Digital in a statement. CHAOS ERUPTS AT GOP LAWMAKER'S TOWN HALL AFTER LEFT-WING GROUPS PROMOTE PROTESTS Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., rallied nearly 12,000 Arizonans in Tempe on Thursday night on the second stop of a three-state West Coast swing. Thousands of supporters have cheered on Sanders at each stop of his \"Fighting Oligarchy\" tour. The rallies reject Trump's executive reach and Elon Musk's efforts to slash federal bureaucracy through the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which Sanders argues is wreaking havoc and turning the country into an oligarchy. Gov. Tim Walz, D-Minn., the former vice presidential candidate, has been crisscrossing the country himself, targeting Republican districts where he says representatives are refusing to meet with their constituents. Walz exchanged barbs with Musk this week after he joked about regularly checking Tesla's stock for an ego boost, which was down 41.4% year-to-date as of March amidst a string of violence against Tesla. \"Sometimes when I need a little boost, I look at the @JDVance portrait in the White House and thank the Lord,\" Musk replied on X to Walz's comment at the \"The People vs Musk\" event on Tuesday. FLORIDA DEMS STAGE TOWN HALLS IN GOP DISTRICTS FEATURING 'MISSING' POSTERS OF THEIR COLLEAGUES Democrats have been without a clear party leader since Trump defeated former Vice President Kamala Harris in November 2024. While Sanders' rallies began last month, Walz launched his own town hall-style event after Politico first reported that the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) advised House Republicans against hosting in-person town halls. Progressive protest groups last month organized disruptions at Republican-held town halls and local legislative offices, effectively shutting them down. Some lawmakers, including Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., reported safety concerns following threats of violence. Many Republicans have opted for tele-town halls as a result, citing productivity in a controlled environment. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson joined the Republican town hall deterrence, telling reporters that Republicans shouldn't give \"professional protesters\" a forum to sell their soundbites and make headlines. Trump called the protesters ‘paid troublemakers’ and said it was ’all part of the game for the Democrats.' After two months of playing defense, it seems Democrats have the ball in their court. BERNIE SANDERS, AOC TAKE AIM AT TRUMP AND MUSK, AS WELL AS DEMOCRATS, AT WESTERN RALLIES Like Walz, Democrats individually capitalized on the narrative that Republicans aren't showing up for their constituents, and town halls began popping up in red districts across the country. Following their big November losses, the Democrats' town halls have become an opportunity for lawmakers to score points with the slew of Americans infuriated with Trump's second term and Musk's DOGE cuts. Last Friday, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) seized the chance to present a united front following weeks of Republican criticism that Democrats lack clear messaging during Trump's second term. The DNC's coordinated effort includes the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), the Association of State Democratic Committees (ASDC) and Democratic state parties to \"hold vulnerable Republican members of Congress accountable for their refusal to face their constituents and answer for their votes to put billionaires above working people.\" The DNC's initial launch included at least nine town halls in Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska and Pennsylvania. As of Friday, there were at least 11 more town halls scheduled this weekend and next week. The DNC and Democratic state parties have held a total of 22 events so far in 13 states, the DNC tells Fox News Digital. As Democrats' town halls find their way to every corner of the United States, David McIntosh, president of Club for Growth, a top conservative group, is now urging Congressional Republicans to participate in town halls, Fox News confirmed. Rep. Mike Flood, R-Neb., was the only House GOP lawmaker whose office set up an in-person town hall this week while Congress is in recess. It ended in chaos on Tuesday night as angry Democratic protesters accused Republicans of trying to gut critical government programs. The audience questions accused Trump and Flood of not supporting the \"rule of law.\" The crowd repeatedly booed any mention of Musk or DOGE. DEM LEADER SWINGS THROUGH GOP-HELD DISTRICTS AFTER 'CLOWN SHOW PROTESTS' HALTED TOWN HALLS But Democrats' town halls haven't been without their own political theater. The Florida Democratic Party created \"missing\" posters of Republican representatives for their town halls. One by one in Clearwater on Saturday, Pinellas County constituents took turns addressing a \"missing\" poster of Rep. Ana Paulina Luna, R-Fla. Conservatives on social media slammed the \"missing\" posters as \"nothing authentic or compelling.\" \"I have never seen the national Democratic Party in such chaos and confusion. Whether it's childish stunts on the floor of Congress or performance art with their fake town halls, there is nothing authentic or compelling about their message, their tactics, or their delivery,\" Republican consultant Frank Luntz replied on X to photos from the event. Luntz compared the Democrats' latest move to holding posters during Trump's joint address to Congress and the coordinated effort by protest groups to disrupt Republican town halls. Others on social media called it \"embarrassing.\" Luna's spokesperson said she has been available at \"numerous events\" and that the Florida representative doesn't \"work for the leftist mob.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Pro-Palestinian protesters disrupted a town hall hosted by Rep. Sean Casten, D-Ill., on Wednesday, when a woman yelled about U.S. support for Israel and a man jumped on stage. Police had to shut down the event and escort constituents out of the venue, CNN reported. Voters also expressed their frustration to Democratic lawmakers that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer had appeased Republicans by voting to fund their continuing resolution to keep the government open last week. Reps. Glenn Ivey, D-Md., Arizona Sens. Ruben Gallego and Mark Kelly, Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., Rep. Janelle Bynum, D-Ore., and Sen.

Though it was a trend in the ’90s, Elon Musk once again reminded people how insulting this has been to people. \n\nThe CEO of Tesla, who owns several companies, used this slur publicly not just once or twice but dozens of times the previous year. He targeted prominent personalities, including Danish astronaut Andreas Mogensen, Yale historian Timothy Snyder, and actor Ben Stiller.\n\nI’m tempted to call this guy a retard, but I won’t because I’ve used that word too many times\n— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 22, 2025 \n\nThe Space X founder responding to Snyder’s criticism of the Trump administration on the X platform, where they tweeted to nearly 200 million followers in February, – “I’m tempted to call this guy a retard, but I won’t because I’ve used that word too many times.\n\nHowever, Elon Musk is not the only person solely responsible for the re-emergence of this slur, as it didn’t completely fade away from several platforms like 4Chan or among so-called “edge lord” comedians—his visibility amplifies its spread. Recent research from Montclair State University found that using this R-word on X triples when the Billionaire uses it.\n\nReservoir @DOGE pic.twitter.com/lcfR6OJ8wu\n— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 20, 2025 \n\nChristy Weir from the Special Olympics said – “Unfortunately, the R-word is a word that is starting to come back into conversation because more people in positions of power — political leaders, business leaders, celebrities — are using it as part of their normal dialogue.”\n\nThe US President, Donald Trump, who has been a close ally of Elon Musk, has taken the same path and frequently used demeaning language. On the 2016 campaign trail, he was seen mocking a reporter’s disability. During his presidential campaign recently, he took things to the limit when he referred to Kamala Harris and former US President Joe Biden as “mentally disabled.”\n\nThis language used in politics is commonly called “politics of cruelty” by critics, and it reflects on the marginalization of disabled individuals. \n\n“I feel liberated,” a Wall Street banker told the Financial Times, celebrating Trump’s election as a victory against so-called “wokeness.” “We can say ‘r—tard’ and ‘p—ssy’ without the fear of getting canceled.”\n\nCommon people are already facing these backlashes, and they have also become alarming for disability advocates like Nila Morton. As per Huff Post, Nila Morton, a graduate of Howard University, said, “They’ve tested the boundaries of what they can say and do, and many people who once hesitated to use offensive language now feel encouraged to push those limits as well.” \n\nEfforts have been made to reduce the use of this R-word, which has been prominent from the fights of several disability rights groups, where campaigns have been there like “Spread the Word to End the Word.” It gained massive traction in several schools across the United States, leading to public awareness and cultural shifts. In 2010, President Obama signed Rosa’s Law, which officially replaced “mental retardation” with “intellectual disability” in federal language.","summary":"When influential figures normalize slurs, marginalized communities bear the brunt.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/elon-musk-has-used-r-word-too-many-times-disability-advocates-feel-he-needs-to-stop","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Untitled-design-2025-03-22T184925.054.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-22 13:25:21","author":"Mayukh B","authors":["Mayukh B"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.034},{"id":302995126,"title":"Joe Soucheray: Walz is more like Trump than he would care to believe","text":"Tim Walz has been touring out of state lately, appearing at town halls, small venues, perhaps at even Chautauquas, in a mimicry of a comedy act or lecture tour, apparently to set us all straight on the error of our ways. Last week, Walz was in Eau Claire, Wis., pacing a stage on which a stool had been placed for a bottle of water, like the spartan props of Lewis Black or Chris Rock. As Walz went for the bottle, his friendly audience could absorb his latest profundity.\n\nWalz said he put a Tesla stock app on his phone to get a little boost during the day watching shares of Tesla stock.\n\n“$225 and dropping,” Tim said, thumb pointing down. The crowd cheered because, you know, Elon Musk.\n\nWe’ll be here a long time if we were to track Walz’s profundities. Outside the venue and all around the country, Tesla dealerships were being vandalized, Tesla cars shot at, keyed and kicked, and Tesla owners, who were never terribly sincere about saving the Earth in the first place, are buying bumper stickers that read “Don’t blame me, I already owned the car.”\n\nInto bed with this destructive crowd climbs Walz, supposedly a governor. Such irrationality suggests that he might not be safe around the Mona Lisa, either, lest he produce a pocket knife and disfigure her face.\n\nSupposedly a governor, who should know better. Tesla employs more than 150,000 American workers, many of whom probably voted for Kamala Harris and Walz. Those workers own Tesla stock. In Minnesota, the State Board of Investment, as of June 30, 2024, had 1.6 million shares of Tesla stock in its retirement fund and 211,000 shares in its non-retirement fund. Mutual funds in retirement plans own Tesla shares. Your Aunt Ethel probably owns Tesla stock and probably the good sisters of St. Joseph, too.\n\nNo kind of fellow preening and begging to be taken seriously as a statesman would denigrate an American company of such magnitude nor would he take glee in the company’s declining share price.\n\nWalz is more like Donald Trump than he would care to believe in the sense that you wonder if anybody can get to him and make him see the light, or at least do some homework. In 2017, Tesla purchased a Minnesota company, Perbix in Brooklyn Park, a creator of sophisticated and automated automobile manufacturing equipment. Perbix employed 150 people at the time, with Musk vowing to recruit more workers. Walz should be the new mug on their dart board.\n\nIn another whistle stop, Walz joined the governor of California, Gavin Newsom, who has a podcast along with a million other people. The two of them came to lament MAGA people and conservatives in general. Well, OK. But then …\n\n“I could kick their ass,” Walz said, meaning, again, MAGA people and conservatives in general. “I think I scare them a little bit.”\n\nYou do, Tim, you do, but not because you’ve been to the gym. You let a city burn. You commit mortal financial sins and are in denial of them. No administration in the history of the state has ever experienced such repetitive fraud. No governor has ever blown such a bountiful surplus. You signed off on an unnecessary new State Office Building, another bill down the drain. If that’s cutting-edge progressive leadership, who wants it?\n\nFull disclosure is required. I am not a Tesla owner, nor have I personally purchased any Tesla stock. Normal people call me a car nut. I need noise and big round instruments with sweeping needles. Oh, and smells, too, the sweet perfume of the petroleum miracle.\n\nI spend enough time sitting in front of a computer screen.\n\nJoe Soucheray can be reached at jsoucheray@pioneerpress.com.

The president has removed clearances from his two opponents he defeated in the race for the White House - democrats Hillary Clinton and former Vice President Kamala Harris -as well as the man who beat him in 2020. In a move seen as Trump taking revenge on his enemies, former president Biden and his entire family have also lost the right, as well as former Secretary of State Antony Blinken. The order was made in a late memorandum issued yesterday afternoon. It reads: “I have determined it is no longer in the national interest for the following individuals to access classified information.” Trump announced on social media last month he was provoking Joe Biden ’s clearance, after the ex president did the same in 2021. He wrote: “There is no need for Joe Biden to continue receiving access to classified information. Therefore, we are immediately revoking Joe Biden's Security Clearances, and stopping his daily Intelligence Briefings. “He set this precedent in 2021, when he instructed the Intelligence Community (IC) to stop the 45th President of the United States (ME! ) from accessing details on National Security, a courtesy provided to former Presidents.\" Former U.S. presidents have traditionally received intelligence briefings so they can advise incumbent presidents on national security and foreign policy. Trump also targeted a critic of the president, Republican former Representative Liz Cheney, former Biden White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan and Fiona Hill, a Russia expert who served on his National Security Council during his first term. Mark Zaid, a national security lawyer in Washington who represents whistleblowers, and Adam Kinzinger, a former Republican lawmaker who is a sharp Trump critic, were also among several others who had their security clearances revoked. Biden had previously ended Trump's intelligence briefings after Trump incited efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election and the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. At the time, Biden cited Trump's \"erratic\" behavior as a reason to prevent him from receiving the intel briefings. In his post, Trump referred to last year's special counsel report into Biden's handling of classified documents, stating, \"The Hur Report revealed Biden suffers from 'poor memory' and, even in his 'prime,' could not be trusted with sensitive information. \"I will always protect our National Security - JOE, YOU'RE FIRED.

Biden Jr.'s family , as per a report.Trump had said in February that he planned to remove his predecessor's access to classified intelligence briefings. It was payback -- Biden had done the same to him after he left office in the days after the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, NYT News Service reported.A variety of figures who've tangled with Trump at one point or another were named in Friday's memo. Some had already been mentioned by Trump officials as people who would soon have their security clearances revoked, so their inclusion in Friday's memo did not come as a shock. But taken together, the catalog of names read like an enemies list.There were New York's top two law enforcement officials, Letitia James (the New York attorney general) and Alvin Bragg (Manhattan's district attorney), both of whom took on Trump.There were prominent characters from the first impeachment brought against Trump in 2019, when he was shown to have tried to strong-arm Ukraine into helping him dig up dirt on Biden. Names included in Friday's memo: Fiona Hill, a top foreign policy expert who testified during the impeachment hearings; Alexander Vindman, a lieutenant colonel who also testified; and Norman Eisen, a lawyer who oversaw that impeachment.And there were the only two Republicans who served on the House Select Committee investigating the January 6 attack, Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger.Since returning to office, Trump has used memos like the one he put out Friday to thwack at people who have tried to hold him accountable or who have otherwise crossed him. The memos have been wide-ranging in scope. Earlier this week, he put out one that pulled security protections for Biden's adult children, Ashley and Hunter, NYT News Service reported.Last month, Trump nixed security clearances for Antony Blinken, the former secretary of state, and Jake Sullivan, the former national security adviser (both of whom were named again in Friday's memo).Trump has also stripped the security detail of his own former aides. Within hours of taking office, he targeted John Bolton, his former national security adviser turned enemy. Trump later did the same to Mike Pompeo, his former secretary of state, and a former aide, Brian Hook.FAQsQ1. Who is President of USA?A1. President of USA is Donald Trump.Q2.

Brad Schimel, a former state attorney general, is the Republican-supported candidate.\n\n“Abortion of course remains a top issue,” said Charles Franklin, a Marquette University political scientist. “But we haven’t seen either candidate be as outspoken on hot-button issues as we saw in 2023.”\n\nDemocrats are hoping voters will be motivated by the potential revival of an abortion ban from 1849, which criminalizes “the willful killing of an unborn quick child.” The Wisconsin Supreme Court is currently deciding whether to reactivate the 175-year-old ban.\n\nPlanned Parenthood of Wisconsin filed a separate lawsuit in February asking the court to rule on whether a constitutional right to abortion exists in the state.\n\nThe 19th century law was enacted just a year after Wisconsin became a state, when lead mining and the lumber industry formed the bedrock of the state’s economy as white settlers rushed into areas left vacant by forced removals of Native American tribes.\n\nIt also was a time when combinations of herbs stimulating uterine contractions were the most common abortion method, said Kimberly Reilly, a history and gender studies professor at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay.\n\n“During this time, there were no women in statehouses,” Reilly said. “When a woman got married, she lost her legal identity. Her husband became her legal representative. She couldn’t own property in her name. She couldn’t make a contract.”\n\nThis is the latest instance of long-dormant restrictions influencing current abortion policies after the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022 overturned Roe v. Wade, which had granted a federal right to abortion.\n\nThe revival of an 1864 Arizona abortion law, enacted when Arizona was a territory, sparked a national outcry last year. Century-old abortion restrictions passed by all-male legislatures during periods when women could not vote — and scientific knowledge of pregnancy and abortion were limited — have also influenced post-Roe abortion policies in Alabama, Arkansas, Michigan, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Texas and West Virginia.\n\nThose laws tend to be more severe. They often do not include exceptions for rape and incest, call for the imprisonment of providers and ban the procedure in the first few weeks of pregnancy. Some have since been repealed, while others are being challenged in court.\n\nDuring the state Supreme Court debate March 12, Crawford declined to weigh in directly on the 1849 abortion case but promoted her experience representing Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin and “making sure that women could make their own choices about their bodies and their health care.” In an ad released Wednesday, she accused Schimel of not trusting “women to make their own healthcare decisions.”\n\nSchimel calls himself “pro-life” and has previously supported leaving Wisconsin’s 1849 abortion ban on the books. He dodged questions about abortion during the debate, saying he believes the issue should be left up to voters, although Wisconsin does not have a citizen-led ballot initiative process, which voters in several other states have used to protect abortion rights.\n\nAnthony Chergosky, a University of Wisconsin-La Crosse political scientist, said Schimel has been “borrowing from the Republican playbook of avoiding the issue of abortion” by leaving the question to voters in individual states.\n\nThe message has still gotten across to many Democratic voters, who cited abortion as a top issue while waiting in line for early voting this past week.\n\nJane Delzer, a 75-year-old liberal voter in Waukesha, said “a woman’s right to choose is my biggest motivator. I’m deeply worried about what Schimel may do on abortion.”\n\nJune Behrens, a 79-year-old retired teacher, spoke about a loved one’s abortion experience: “Everyone makes their own choice and has their own journey in life, and they deserve that right.”\n\nRepublican voters primarily cited immigration and the economy as their top issues, essentially the same ones that helped propel Republican Donald Trump's win over Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris last November in the presidential election. But others said they also wanted conservative social views reflected on the court.\n\nLewis Titus, a 72-year-old volunteer for the city of Eau Claire, said restricting abortion was his top issue in the Supreme Court race: \"I believe that Brad Schimel is the one to carry that on.”\n\nWhile it's one of the key issues this year, abortion played a much larger role two years ago, when a race for Wisconsin’s highest court demonstrated how expensive and nationalized state Supreme Court races have become.\n\nThis year’s campaigns have focused primarily on “criminal sentencing and attempting to paint one another as soft on crime,” said Howard Schweber, a University of Wisconsin-Madison political science professor emeritus.\n\nCrawford also has tried to make the race a referendum on Trump after his first months in office and tech billionaire Elon Musk, who is running Trump’s massive federal cost-cutting initiative and has funded two groups that have together spent more than $10 million to promote Schimel.\n\n“Two years ago, abortion was a hugely mobilizing issue, and we saw that clearly in the lead-up to the election,” Schweber said. “We’re seeing some of this but not to the same extent, which really makes no sense. The issues and stakes are exactly the same.”\n\nThe decision to elevate other issues might be the result of anxiety among Democrats that abortion may not resonate as deeply as they once believed after significant election losses in November, despite Harris using abortion as a pillar of her campaign, several Wisconsin politics experts said.\n\nCharles Franklin, a Marquette University political scientist, said he believes abortion will motivate Democrats, but the issue may not rank high in the priorities of independent voters, who he says will be central to the race's outcome.\n\n“In the early days after Roe v. Wade was overturned, it was still a very hot issue for voters,” he said. “But as states have codified their abortion laws, the issue doesn’t seem to motivate voters to the same extent. In the fall, many Democrats believed abortion was still this magic silver bullet and would win them the presidential and Senate races. But the outcomes didn’t seem to support that.”\n\nAssociated Press video journalist Mark Vancleave in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, contributed to this report.\n\nThe Associated Press receives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.

However, one political scientist told Newsweek that the prospect of a constitutional amendment allowing the incumbent to run again is \"pure MAGA fantasy.\"Newsweek contacted the White House press office for comment on Saturday via email outside regular office hours.Why It MattersIn November, Trump secured a second White House term after convincingly defeating then-Vice President Kamala Harris in the presidential election, receiving 312 electoral votes to the Democrat's 226 and winning the popular vote for the first time.Since Trump's victory—when he became the second president in U.S. history to be elected to a nonconsecutive term—a number of his allies have suggested that he should run again in 2028, including his former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon. Trump himself has repeatedly made quips about running for a third term.What To KnowIn odds sent to Newsweek on March 21, William Hill gave Trump a 5/1 chance of winning the 2028 president election, second only to Vance on 5/2 (28.6 percent).The president and vice president were followed by Trump's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., on 9/1 odds (10 percent). Two Democratic governors—Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania and Gavin Newsom of California—rounded out the top five with 9/1 odds and 10/1 odds (9.1 percent), respectively.Trump is ineligible to serve a third term as president because of the 22nd Amendment, which—since 1951—has imposed a two-term limit on any person elected to the office of president.The 22nd Amendment says, \"No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once.\"Congress can request an amendment to the constitution with a two-thirds majority vote in both chambers. Two-thirds of all state legislatures can also call for an amendment, which would trigger a constitutional convention. To be passed into law, the proposed amendment would then need the support of three-quarters of all U.S. states.As Republicans have neither a two-thirds majority in either chamber of Congress nor control of two-thirds of state legislatures, it would be impossible for them to pass even the first of these hurdles without Democratic support.William Hill gave odds of 5/2 on Trump repealing the 22nd Amendment and running for a third term before 2029.During a speech at the New York Young Republican Club's annual gala in December, Bannon argued that Trump could run for a third term because the 22nd Amendment applied only to consecutive terms, though this interpretation is not widely held.What People Are SayingA William Hill spokesperson told Newsweek: \"It's certainly not going to be plain sailing for Donald Trump if he attempts to repeal the 22nd Amendment in order to run for a third term as president (5/2 to do so before 2029), but given his strength of support in the House and the Senate, he may be tempted to try.\"Trump ally Steve Bannon predicted this week that the POTUS would run for a third term and win, so there's certainly a feeling that it could be possible, and we're not taking any chances as we've installed him in our next president market at 5/1, behind only favorite JD Vance.\"Thomas Gift, who heads the Center on U.S. Politics at University College London, told Newsweek: \"Trump may see himself as a king, and many of his closest allies, including Steve Bannon, may be floating the possibility of a 2028 run.\"But that's just a tactic to strengthen his political capital, flaunt his current power, and keep his grip on the GOP as long as possible. A constitutional amendment to do away with the two-term limit is pure MAGA fantasy—requiring overwhelming congressional and state-level support that simply isn't in the cards.\"Dafydd Townley, an American politics expert who teaches at the University of Portsmouth in the U.K., told Newsweek: \"It would be ironic if Republicans managed to repeal the 22nd Amendment to allow Trump a third term, when it was brought in by Republicans to ensure that Harry Truman was not elected for four terms as his predecessor, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, was.\"The repeal would be exceptionally time-consuming in terms of its progress through Congress and the ratification by the states. [Thirty-eight] states would be needed to ratify the amendment, and currently only 23 are identified as being controlled by Republicans. …\"Of course, if the 22nd Amendment was repealed, that could set up not just a third Trump administration but also a third Obama administration. Republicans should be careful what they wish for.\"What Happens NextFor a realistic chance of repealing the 22nd Amendment, Republicans would need to make major gains at the 2026 midterm elections or persuade a substantial number of Democrats to support the constitutional change.","summary":"The 22nd Amendment would need to be repealed to make President Donald Trump eligible to run for a third term in 2028.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-among-2028-presidential-favorites-despite-two-term-limit-2048984","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2612717/donald-trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-22 12:41:30","author":"James Bickerton","authors":["James Bickerton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.085},{"id":302981692,"title":"Kryeministri Rama uron besimtarët bektashinj","text":"S’do kenë më akses mbi informacionet e klasifikuara\n\nTrump fut në “listën e zezë” Kamala Harris dhe Hillary Clinton\n\nKritikat e Serbisë për marrëveshjen\n\nÇfarë përmban deklarata për bashkëpunim ushtarak mes Kosovës, Shqipërisë dhe Kroacisë?\n\n“Shqipëria ka një mundësi historike për të arritur”\n\nAmbasadori Gonzato: Mbështesim ambiciet për mbylljen e negociatave!\n\n“Unë jam martuar disa herë, tani ta martojmë Shqipërinë”\n\nRama: ‘Nusen’ më të bukur ta fusim në familjen më të fortë!\n\n\"Në fund historia do kujtojë veprat, jo thashethemet!\"\n\nLëvizjet në bashkinë e Tiranës!

In Durham, an 18-year-old high school student did not get a say in who should serve on the school board or whether $125,000 should go toward replacing artificial turf on athletic fields.\n\nNeither was able to participate in recent town elections in New Hampshire thanks to a new state law requiring proof of U.S. citizenship to register to vote. Their experiences, recounted by town clerks, could prove instructive for the rest of the country as the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act advances in Congress and more than a dozen states consider similar legislation.\n\n“Everything that conservatives tried to downplay, New Hampshire told us exactly what would happen on a national scale under the SAVE Act,” said Greta Bedekovics, a former policy adviser for Senate Democrats who is now with the Center for American Progress.\n\nMarried women with changed names face extra hurdles\n\nVoting rights groups are particularly concerned that married women who have changed their names will encounter trouble when trying to register because their birth certificates list their maiden names.\n\nThat is exactly what happened to Brooke Yonge, a 45-year-old hairstylist who showed up at her polling place in Derry last week determined to show her support for public education.\n\nShe was turned away initially because she did not have proof of citizenship. When she returned with her birth certificate, that still was not enough because the name on the document did not match the one on her driver’s license. Back home she went to fetch her marriage license to prove she had changed her name.\n\n“Third trip around the sun and here we are,” said Yonge, who called the registration requirements reasonable despite the hassle. “If I did a little research, I probably would have known that is what I needed.”\n\nNew Hampshire is among the 20 states that allow voters to register on the day of an election. According to the New Hampshire Campaign for Voting Rights, at least 56 people who tried to register statewide the day of the March 11 town elections were turned away, though it is unknown how many of them later completed the process.\n\nDerry’s town clerk, Tina Guilford, wonders how it will go during a November general election, when turnout is much higher.\n\n“It’s just heartbreaking to me to see people turn around and think, ‘I hope they come back,’” she said.\n\nAt least one person who tried to register in Milford on Tuesday did not return, said Joan Dargie, the town clerk. Neither did an older woman who tried to register at Town Hall before the election. The first of the woman’s three marriages was in Florida in the 1970s and that license was long gone, Dargie said.\n\n“Sometimes people are like, ‘I didn’t save any paperwork for that. I wanted to forget all that,’” Dargie said. “It’s disenfranchising women.”\n\nWhat’s happening at the national level\n\nThe U.S. House passed legislation last year to require proof of citizenship for voter registration, but it stalled in the Senate amid Democratic opposition. With Republicans now in full control of Congress, the House is expected to take up the issue again soon.\n\nBefore the 2024 election, Donald Trump falsely claimed that noncitizens might vote in large enough numbers to sway the outcome. In fact, research and reviews of state cases have shown voting by noncitizens to be rare and typically a mistake rather than an intentional effort to subvert an election.\n\nRepublicans argue that even small numbers of noncitizens voting undermines public confidence.\n\nNew Hampshire’s new law also has had broad support. About 8 in 10 New Hampshire voters in the 2024 election favored requiring people in their state to show a passport, birth certificate or other evidence of U.S. citizenship when they register to vote, according to AP VoteCast, including about 6 in 10 who were strongly in favor. The vast majority of Trump voters were in support of the requirement, but so were more than half of voters for Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris in the race against Republican Trump.\n\nDuring the recent town hall elections, Michael Appleton had to return home to get his birth certificate and provide proof of a name change before he could register and vote. Even so, he wasn’t critical of the new law.\n\n“It’s inconvenient for me personally in this moment, but I don’t think it’s an unreasonable thing to ask,” he said.\n\nRepublican state Rep. Bob Lynn, who sponsored New Hampshire’s law, does not believe there is rampant voter fraud in the state. He also does not believe the new citizenship requirements are unduly burdensome.\n\n“It seems to me that voting is pretty important, and it’s not unreasonable to say to people, look, you’re going to have to give a little bit of forethought to what you need in order to vote,” said Lynn, a former chief justice of the New Hampshire Supreme Court.\n\nOther states also are taking action\n\nNew Hampshire is one of eight states with laws that require documentary proof of citizenship to register to vote, and similar legislation is pending in 17 states, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\nThe experience has at times been fraught in some states that have enacted a proof-of-citizenship requirement.\n\nIn Arizona, a recent state audit found that problems with the way data was handled had affected the tracking and verification of citizenship. It came after officials had identified some 200,000 voters who were thought to have provided citizenship, but had not.\n\nA proof of citizenship requirement was in effect for three years in Kansas before it was overturned through legal challenges. The state’s own expert estimated that almost all the roughly 30,000 people who were prevented from registering to vote during the time it was in effect were U.S. citizens who had been eligible to vote.\n\nIn Texas, where Republicans control both houses of the Legislature, lawmakers have introduced a bill that would in some ways expand on the proposed federal SAVE Act. It would require proof of citizenship for voter registration and compel state and local election officials to verify the citizenship status of everyone who is already registered.\n\nIf a person’s citizenship cannot be verified, that person would be notified and allowed to vote in only congressional elections.\n\nFurther changes possible in New Hampshire\n\nEven as New Hampshire’s law faces legal challenges, state lawmakers are considering further changes.\n\nThe state House gave preliminary approval last week to a bill that would create vouchers to cover the cost for indigent voters of obtaining a birth certificate, though opponents said asking voters to declare themselves poor would be demeaning. It also would instruct the secretary of state to make “reasonable efforts” to verify citizenship if someone is unable to provide documentation. Critics noted the office has access only to birth certificates issued in New Hampshire.\n\n“If you’re going to pass a bill, make sure that it can withstand litigation and make sure that it offers real solutions. This bill does neither,” Democratic Rep. Connie Lane said.\n\nIn Durham, where voting takes place in the town’s high school, students enrolled in civics classes traditionally watch the process. They got an extra lesson during the recent town hall elections. A student who was old enough to vote wanted to register but did not have the documents to prove citizenship, according to Rachel Deane, the town clerk.\n\n“The supervisors of the voter checklist are wonderful in Durham, and they walked the student through the process and encouraged them to come back,” she said.\n\nDeane said she believes the student never did return.\n\nCasey reported from Derry, New Hampshire, and Cassidy from Atlanta.
