And then the air show, she gave me a much bigger [one], and I didn’t ask her.”\n\n Toward the end of the Oct. 5 episode’s opening sketch, which featured Carvey’s Joe Biden enjoying some ice cream next to Rudolph’s Kamala Harris and Andy Samberg’s Doug Emhoff as they watched the vice presidential debate, Carvey smacks the ice cream into Rudolph’s face as she sits there seemingly surprised, trying to hold back a laugh.\n\n “I was right kinda gesturing,” Carvey recalled off the split-second decision. “I thought, ‘Here’s ice cream, big gob. Here’s Maya’s face.’ And I didn’t wanna hurt her, but I just — I thought of it, and did it within two seconds. So that’s to put to rest all the rumors and all the talk.”\n\n Later in the podcast, Carvey said he thinks there’s been a more “playful and fun” response to his Biden impression since the president dropped out of the 2024 presidential race against Donald Trump, whereas “it was a hot oven” when he was running for reelection.\n\n But overall, Carvey never wants to come across as disrespecting Biden. He views his impersonation as just exaggerating some of the president’s unique qualities. \n\n “The main thing is it’s making me laugh, and I’m definitely doing stuff that he doesn’t do,” the comedian added. “He doesn’t smash ice creams into faces. You know? He doesn’t say, ‘I can’t believe it’s not butter.’ I’m doing what I did to the first Bush.”\n\n Carvey was a castmember on SNL from 1986 to 1993, during which he played several politicians, including President George H.W. Bush. And now he’s back to play Biden during the NBC show’s 50th season.","summary":"The comedian is playing Joe Biden during the sketch comedy show's 50th season, alongside Rudolph's Kamala Harris.","url":"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/snl-dana-carvey-smashing-ice-cream-maya-rudolph-face-unplanned-1236030912/","image":"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dana-Carvey-Maya-Rudolph-Jim-Gaffigan-SNL-publicity-H-2024.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-12 23:51:52","author":"Carly Thomas","authors":["Carly Thomas"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.205},{"id":259475142,"title":"Shunned By Biden Administration, Awami League Lobbying With Donald Trump","text":"By Nitya Chakraborty\n\nThe U.S. Presidential elections on November 5 have assumed unusual significance in the shaping up of the future of Bangladesh which is presently ruled by an interim government headed by the Nobel Laureate Dr. Muhammad Yunus. In the last two weeks, hectic activities were on in both Dhaka as well as in Washington DC and New York by all the contending parties- the chief adviser Dr. Yunus, the main opposition and the aspirant for heading the post election government BNP and the disgraced, now politically shunned ousted ruling party Awami League to explain their respective viewpoints on the Bangladesh developments to the US political establishment covering both the ruling Democratic Party and the opposition Republicans.\n\nDr. Yunus did his lobbying\" 94357 target=\"_self\">lobbying at official level in New York during his visit to United Nations, from September 24 to September 27 mostly with the US administration including President Biden and the secretary of state Antony Blinken. He had no meeting with any important official of Trump camp. Dr. Yunus depended on his friends in the Democratic Party, especially the Clintons and he went back convinced that he had managed all the support that was needed from the U.S. Government.\n\nDr. Yunus’s main contender Awami League was not sitting idle. The AL, despite its ouster in Bangladesh and attacks by the present ruling establishment has the largest support base in overseas, especially in the USA and UK and its Bangladeshi diaspora with active AW supporters with high connections, were mobilized soon after Dr. Yunus’s return to Dhaka, to lobby with both the Democratic Party establishment as also the campaign committee of Donald Trump.. Sources say that the AL lobby did not get response from the Kamala Harris camp but they got very good response from the Trump’s advisers. It is not clear whether the AL people could hold a meeting with Trump himself, but certainly they were happy with the initial reaction of the advisers.\n\nThe narrative is this. Trump camp knows that Dr. Yunus is a protégé of Hillary Clinton and Trump hates Hillary the most. Even now, in private talks, he calls Hillary a witch and ‘that nasty woman’. The AL leaders harped on this and made the Trump advisers take an anti-Yunus position. . Things will move only after the elections results are out on November 5 night. The political observers of the Bangladesh politics based in Washington believe that if Trump wins, certainly, Dr. Yunus will be in trouble just because he is Hillary’s man but for no other reasons. The AL league wants that Trump should ensure the observance of free and fair elections with the participation of Awami League.\n\nThe present main political party in Bangladesh BNP has also lobbied both with the Biden administration and Trump campaign committee. They have sought for early elections in Bangladesh. They have contested the argument of Dr. Yunus that the elections can be held only after the implementation of reforms in tree key areas. They feel that the elections can be held while the reforms are on.\n\nAs regards India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has a big political stake in the outcome of the presidential elections on November 5. The Modi government is not comfortable with some of the views of the Democratic Presidential nominee Kamala Harris. She is a committed human rights lawyer and her friends in the Democratic Party are anti-Modi. Further BJP as a party is working for Trump presidency in 2024. In USA, the Overseas Friends of BJP is the party wing of its supporters.. Apart there are strong VHP units and Hindu organisations which have close ties with the BJP. PM Modi is a darling to them, many of whom are Gujaratis.\n\nAccording to a census published in 2023, the US’ 4.4 million Indians now outnumber the Chinese diaspora in the country. Moreover, they’re not just influential on the political scene. 25 of the 500 largest American companies are headed by Indians, including Microsoft, YouTube, Google and Adobe, compared with just 11 a decade ago. The rise of this diaspora is a recent development, coinciding with the arrival of Indian engineers in Silicon Valley from the 2000s onwards. In the US, Indians are the best-paid and most highly educated migrants.\n\nIn 2020 presidential elections, estimates made by Indian organisations show that 74 per cent of the Indian Americans voted for the Democratic Party despite high campaign by BJP dominated Indian diaspora with – ‘ Phir Ekbar Trump Sarkar’ in the podium at Houston in 2019. This time, in 2024 elections, the BJP government is feeling it more necessary for them for Trump to win. Accordingly all instructions have been given and the pro-BJP Indian organisations are campaigning for Trump though finally all BJP loyalists may not vote for Trump. Ram Madhav the RSS strongman is in charge of the BJP’s Indian diaspora activities in US.\n\nIn sum, Bangladesh politicians and the interim government will be anxiously waiting for the installation of the next President on January 21 , 2025.. If Kamala Harris is elected that does not mean that she will follow fully Biden and Clintons policies in supporting Dr. Yunus. Harris has her own mind. She can review policies also. Not just as President, as a human rights lawyer also, she will judge the situation in Bangladesh. As regards Trump occupying White House again, the only surety is Dr. Yunus will be bundled out but the next step is unpredictable.

Born and raised in the state, Harris previously served as California’s attorney general and remains widely popular there.\n\nIn the last presidential election, in 2020, Trump lost in California to Democrat Joe Biden by nearly 30 percentage points.\n\nIn a statement announcing the event, Trump’s campaign said the stop will seek to underscore that, “under Kamala Harris and her dangerous Democrat allies like [running mate] Tim Walz, the notorious ‘California Dream’ has turned into a nightmare for everyday Americans”.\n\nThe visit to the state has widely been viewed as an effort to shore up wider Republican support. That is particularly needed in six key races for the House of Representatives in California.\n\nControl of both the House and the Senate — the two chambers of the US Congress — is up for grabs this election season. And certain congressional districts in California are tightly split between Republicans and Democrats.\n\nA victory in the six competitive House races could help Republicans retain their hold over the lower chamber.\n\nGoing to California gives Trump the “ability to swoop in and leverage this big population of Trump supporters”, Tim Lineberger, who was communications director for Trump’s 2016 campaign in Michigan and worked in the former president’s administrations, told the Associated Press news agency.\n\nHe’s “coming here and activating that”, Lineberger added.\n\nThe move may also be an effort to boost Trump’s final vote count. In the US, the victor in the presidential race is decided by the Electoral College, a weighted voting system in which states award electors to the candidates based on the state-level vote.\n\nNearly all states award all their electors in a winner-takes-all system: Even if a candidate wins by a small margin in a given state, they receive all the electors.\n\nThat means that a candidate can lose in the overall popular vote but win in the Electoral College system, as Trump did in 2016. In 2020, however, he lost in both measures to Biden.\n\nHaving never won the popular vote has remained a sore subject for the former Republican president. California, with its population of nearly 40 million, offers the possibility to turn out supporters who might not otherwise feel it is worthwhile to go to the polls.\n\n“I believe Donald Trump is coming to California because he wants to win not only in the Electoral College, but he wants to win the popular vote,” Jim Brulte, a former chairman of the California Republican Party, told the Associated Press.\n\nBattleground blitz\n\nTo be sure, Trump is sandwiching his California visit between a stop in Nevada on Saturday and a rally in Arizona on Sunday, two battleground states more typical for the final weeks of a presidential campaign.\n\nIn Nevada, Trump attended a roundtable with Latino voters, as his campaign sought to capitalise on signs that Latino men are increasingly turning away from Democrats.\n\nFor her part, Harris visited North Carolina, which was recently devastated by Hurricane Helene. She said her visit was “first and foremost to see how they’re doing in the wake of the hurricane”.\n\nHarris was also set to promote her plan for an “opportunity economy” and meet with Black community leaders. Trump narrowly won North Carolina in 2020, but the eastern state has been trending towards Democrats in some recent polls, buoyed by its large college-educated and Black population.\n\nEarlier in the day, Harris released the results of a health exam. It said she has “the physical and mental resiliency required to successfully execute the duties of the presidency”.\n\nReleasing health exams has long been a norm for presidential candidates in the US, with Harris quickly underscoring that the 78-year-old Trump has so far not done so.\n\n“It is clear to me that he and his team do not want the American people to really see what it is that he is doing and whether or not he actually is fit to do the job of being president of the United States,” she told reporters.\n\nTrump’s campaign has maintained that the former president “has voluntarily released updates from his personal physician” and from the doctor who treated him after an assassination attempt in July.\n\n“All have concluded he is in perfect and excellent health to be Commander in Chief,” his campaign spokesman said, while charging that Harris “does not have the stamina” of Trump.","summary":"Trip to the Democratic stronghold likely underscores effort to shore up congressional Republicans, boost popular vote.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/12/trump-to-rally-in-solid-blue-california-in-unorthodox-campaign-move?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/AP24286773879838-1728772368.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-12 23:22:13","author":"Al Jazeera,Apps Support","authors":["Al Jazeera","Apps Support"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"qa","sentiment":-0.012},{"id":259476296,"title":"The CIA, a Navy Seal and a $15M bounty. This alleged plot on Venezuela’s Maduro reads like a Hollywood script, for a reason","text":"(CNN) — It was the perfect feel-good story, just in time for Christmas.\n\nOn December 20 last year, the United States secured from Venezuela the release of 10 US citizens – six of them wrongfully detained – in exchange for a close ally of authoritarian President Nicolas Maduro and a commitment from Caracas that it would stop detaining Americans to use as negotiating pawns.\n\n“The administration has made abundantly clear the expectation that additional Americans are not detained, and has secured commitments along those lines,” a cheerful US official announced at the time.\n\nThat deal, which also included the extradition of a former military contractor known as “Fat Leonard” who orchestrated the largest corruption scandal in US Navy history, was hailed as a thawing of relations in the long-running standoff between the countries that has seen the US impose sanctions on Venezuela and accuse its leader of illegally usurping power, abusing human rights and trafficking drugs.\n\nBut fast-forward to nearly a year later and the vibe has turned more Halloween trick than Christmas treat.\n\nVenezuela recently announced it had detained at least four US citizens, along with a handful of other foreign nationals, alleging they were part of an international conspiracy masterminded by the CIA and Spanish intelligence to overthrow Maduro.\n\nThat claim has been strongly denied by both the US and Spanish governments.\n\nThe US State Department has said the claims are “categorically false” and intimated that the detentions are linked to American criticisms of Venezuela’s disputed presidential election, which Maduro claims to have won despite widespread skepticism. The United States “continues to support a democratic solution to the political crisis in Venezuela,” the State Department said, pointedly, when commenting on the allegations.\n\nSo, is there anything to Venezuela’s claims? And if not, what does Maduro hope to gain by returning to an old playbook?\n\nHollywood script and a convenient bogeyman\n\nThe details of the alleged plot read like the script of a Hollywood thriller. Maduro’s interior minister Diosdado Cabello claims the detained foreigners – who also included two Spaniards and a Czech – were part of a shadowy unit who traveled to Venezuela to kill Maduro, apparently motivated by the up to $15 million reward the US Justice Department offered in 2020 for information leading to his arrest or conviction.\n\nAccording to Cabello, the plot not only involved the CIA but was led by an active duty US Navy Seal, and involved a shipment of 400 (now seized) US-manufactured rifles and other firearms.\n\nTwo other US citizens, Cabello claims, were “hackers” intent on disrupting Venezuela’s chronically inefficient power service. (Not the first time Cabello has cried foul over blackouts; he alleged “terrorist actions” by the opposition were behind a late-August blackout that affected at least nine Venezuelan states and dozens of cities including the capital Caracas.)\n\nIntriguingly, White House spokesperson John Kirby confirmed that the man Caracas identified as the alleged ringleader – Wilbert Castañeda – is an active service member in the US Navy whom, Kirby said, went to Venezuela on “personal travel.” Other media have reported that Castañeda, who is a dual Mexican-US citizen, used to serve as a Navy Seal but was stripped of his status sometime in the past.\n\nGiven the nature of the allegations, Venezuela’s claims are almost impossible to independently verify.\n\nBut then skeptics might say that’s exactly the point – that for Maduro, the CIA is merely a convenient, tried-and-tested bogeyman.\n\nMaduro has in the past also alleged, without proof, that the US government and former US President Donald Trump were behind a 2018 assassination attempt in which an explosive-laden drone detonated mid-air during one of his speeches (an ‘attack’ prosecutors initially tried to pin on then-Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos). Maduro has also alleged, again without evidence, that the CIA and Washington in general were to blame for an insurrection in April 2019, and in September of the following year his government detained US citizen Matthew Heath on allegations of spying on oil refineries in the state of Falcon. Heath was later released in a prisoner exchange, and the US government has always denied involvement in any of the alleged schemes.\n\nAll that said, Maduro knows there is an audience receptive to such narratives, precisely because the CIA does have a well-documented history of meddling in the region. And it’s likely not lost on him that the US was aware of a plot to overthrow his predecessor, Hugo Chavez, weeks before a coup d’etat was attempted in 2002.\n\n‘Loose dogs’, or a threat from within?\n\nStill, even among those in the Venezuelan government who believe the security services have stumbled on some kind of plot, there are some who are skeptical of Cabello’s claims of CIA involvement.\n\n“I think these are more loose dogs than a real involvement from the US government, because everyone knows that removing Maduro by force would only escalate the conflict around Venezuela,” said a government source who, like other people consulted for this article, asked not to be named due to the confidential nature of the topic.\n\n“But you cannot underestimate the allure of the ($15 million Department of Justice) reward especially for crazy adventurers, or do you really believe a Navy Seal on active duty travelled to Venezuela for a summer romance?” the source said.\n\nOne scenario that doesn’t seem to be under consideration in Caracas’ corridors of power is whether a plot could have originated from within the country.\n\nThat may sound surprising, given Maduro has alienated vast swathes of the population with his election ‘victory’ and subsequent crackdown on the opposition. He has also likely alienated some of those within his own government with his habit of chopping and changing key personnel on a whim.\n\nBut while it’s not impossible to imagine former Chavistas plotting to bring Maduro down, a more likely explanation may simply be that the Venezuelan leader has cooked up the whole story for political leverage against his old foe, the US.\n\nIf so, what does Maduro think he has to gain?\n\nA negotiating tactic?\n\nThe obvious answer leads back to the election. In October last year, before the release of “Fat Leonard” and Co, Maduro had promised the US that Venezuela’s election would be free and fair. And as recently as six months ago, the economic community in Caracas was hoping it would be at least fair enough for the US to lift its remaining oil sanctions and bring Venezuela back into the fold of the world’s democracies.\n\nThe subsequent electoral farce, and Maduro’s desertion of his commitments to restore democracy, pulverized those hopes and made it clear that any further steps toward reconciliation would have to be painfully negotiated by diplomats.\n\nIt would seem Maduro sees the newly detained Americans as pawns to be used in those negotiations, with a view to quieting US criticisms of the election, and as leverage in any sanctions negotiations.\n\nIt’s an approach that sends a calculated message to US President Joe Biden, whose administration has prioritized the release of US citizens unjustly detained abroad – having reached similar deals with Russian President Vladimir Putin over the releases of WNBA star Brittney Griner and the Wall Street Journal journalist Evan Gershkovich.\n\nBut beyond Biden, the detentions are also a message to the new Commander in Chief, be it Kamala Harris or Donald Trump.\n\nSince the disputed vote in Venezuela, the State Department has only minimally acted against the country, imposing personal sanctions on 16 individuals and calling for Venezuela to release the full voting ballots to clarify the result.\n\nWhile the US has imposed economic sanctions on Venezuela’s oil exports for years, a special authorization allowing oil company Chevron to operate in the country is still valid despite the international outcry this summer.\n\nWhoever wins the US election in November will have the fate of the detainees weighing on them when they are faced with deciding whether to continue that minimal approach or to turn the screw.\n\nAnd they can forget any hope that the detainees’ fate can be left to the courts.\n\n“You cannot even talk of a trial, to be honest,” said a lawyer who represented US citizens wrongfully detained in Venezuela in the past. “In most cases, there’s no file with the charges presented against your client, you don’t have access to the investigation, there are no witnesses, and you cannot present new evidence, all of those proceedings happen in a court, but they’re a farce.”\n\n“It’s frustrating, you basically go to court, and you know nothing ruled there will make any difference for your client,” said another lawyer, whose client was released after spending more than two years in jail without being sentenced.\n\nSo, what’s Maduro’s bottom line?\n\nEven for those convinced that Maduro has cooked up the plot to gain leverage with the US, there’s one mystery left: his preferred endgame.\n\nIn previous negotiations over prisoner exchanges, Maduro was able to obtain the release of his alleged money fixer, Alex Saab, and of two of his wife’s nephews who were serving time for trying to smuggle 800 kilograms of cocaine into the United States.\n\nHe was also able to secure the withdrawal of some of the oil sanctions the US imposed on Caracas in recent years.\n\nThis time around, with none of his close associates in US hands, it’s unclear what Maduro could ask at the bargaining table other than legitimacy and further sanctions withdrawal.\n\nLikewise, it’s unclear how a new US administration would entertain the idea of giving in to – and being seen to give into – an authoritarian bully.\n\nHostage negotiation is an awkward topic for any government, none more so than the United States, which has in the past made a point of refusing to engage with kidnappers.\n\nOn the other hand, the US may decide the freedom of its citizens are worth whatever limited concessions Maduro is seeking.\n\nAs one of the people involved in last year’s negotiations put it: “Free societies decide that no innocent man should be in jail. When you accept that a criminal walks free but no detainee is innocent, that is real freedom.”\n\nThe-CNN-Wire™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

They’re saying people impacted by these storms will receive $750 in cash and no more. That’s simply not true,” Biden said on Wednesday. \n\n“They’re saying the money needed for this crisis is being diverted to migrants. What a ridiculous thing to say. It’s not true.”\n\nAlthough most of the false claims spread about the storms are related to relief and rescue efforts, one falsehood relates to how the storm actually formed. \n\nBiden also slammed the “even more bizarre” claims being promoted by Georgia congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, a far-right Republican who is known for her belief in outlandish conspiracy theories.\n\nTaylor Greene, a diehard suppoter of Donald Trump, was elected to Congress on the back of her promotion of conspiracies, most notably QAnon, which casts Trump as a saviour figure battling against evil forces in the “Deep State” in Washington.\n\nShe responded to the hurricanes by claiming that the US federal government was “literally controlling the weather”.\n\n Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris on a visit to North Carolina, 5 October. Alamy Stock Photo\n\n Alamy Stock Photo\n\n‘Geo-engineering’ falsehood\n\nTaylor Greene’s suggestion was that the US government created Hurricane Helene via geoengineering, something that is not physically possible. \n\nIn a post on X, she wrote: “Climate change is the new Covid. Ask your government if the weather is manipulated or controlled. Did you ever give permission to them to do it? Are you paying for it? Of course you are.”\n\nIt drew a common link between Covid and green policies that have become popular among conspiracy theorists in the aftermath of the pandemic.\n\nTheir belief is that both the virus and the storms are manmade weapons designed to reduce the world’s population, something that conspiracy theorists believe is an objective of world elites, or “globalists” (with a corollary that government efforts to minimise Covid, like vaccines, or introduce measures to reduce climate change are oppressive).\n\nNotably, professional conspiracy theorist Alex Jones is among those who have been promoting the claim. \n\nIn another post, Taylor Greene also shared a video of former CIA director John Brennan talking about the potential for geoengineering as a way to reduce global warming.\n\n“Yes they can control the weather,” she wrote. “Anyone who says they don’t, or makes fun of this, is lying to you. By the way, the people know it and hate all of you who try to cover it up.”\n\nThere have been numerous attempts made by scientists to control the weather through geoengineering in the past. \n\nThose attempts have sought to do the opposite of what Taylor Greene has suggested.\n\nRather than making weather systems more dangerous, they have sought to weaken storms and alleviate the impacts of climate change. \n\n An overturned car after Hurricane Helene hit North Carolina.

We are expecting another hurricane hitting,” US Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in early October.\n\n“FEMA does not have the funds to make it through the season.”\n\nTrump and some members of his Republican party have accused Biden and Kamala Harris of misappropriating FEMA funds and spending them on immigrants.\n\n“They stole the FEMA money, just like they stole it from a bank, so they could give it to their illegal immigrants that they want to have vote for them this season,” Trump said in Michigan last week.\n\nIt’s a false claim that has been repeatedly debunked. Harris has described it as “extraordinarily irresponsible.”\n\nThe claims conflate FEMA’s disaster relief fund with a separate programme it administers that provides support to homeless immigrants.\n\nMoney assigned by Congress to the disaster relief fund must be used for that purpose; any other use is illegal.\n\n FEMA Urban Search and Rescue Teams with New Jersey Task Force 1 use chain saws to clear debris in the search for victims and survivors in Asheville, North Carolina. Alamy Stock Photo\n\n Alamy Stock Photo\n\nVirginia Congressman Ben Cline has made the claim too. In a post on X, he wrote: “The Biden-Harris Administration has diverted over $1 billion in FEMA funds meant for disaster relief to illegal immigrant services.”\n\nOhio congressman Jim Jordan has also posted the claim on X.\n\nBoth posts link to an article on The Federalist website, which has a history of publishing false information.\n\nDuring the Covid-19 pandemic, it featured an article by a man described as a physician, whose medical license had expired, which argued for the hosting of parties to help spread the infection in the virus. \n\n“There’s a lot of mis- and disinformation being pushed out there by the former president about what is available, in particular, to the survivors of Helene,” Harris said.\n\n“No money is being diverted from disaster response needs. None,” the White House has said.\n\nBiden has written a letter requesting a recall of Congress in order to allocate more funds for disaster relief, but House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican, has said he has no plans for an early recall. \n\n“We’ll be back in session immediately after the election,” Johnson told Fox News.\n\n“That’s 30 days from now. The thing about these hurricanes and disasters of this magnitude is it takes a while to calculate the actual damages, and the states are going to need some time to do that,” he said.\n\nRumours hurting relief efforts\n\nThere has been a slew of other falsehoods and rumours about the federal response that FEMA’s chief has criticised as “dangerous” because they plant doubt in the minds of people who need help and lead to mistrust in the agency.\n\nDebunking the false claims has also been a distraction for FEMA officials.\n\nIn fact, there have been so many rumours and lies about FEMA’s response that the agency has set up a webpage dedicated to refuting them.\n\nThey range from accuastions that FEMA is stealing land to claims that the agency is preventing people from evacuating. \n\n“They’re being treated very badly in the Republican areas,” Trump told Fox News, referring to people affected by Helene. “They’re not getting water, they’re not getting anything.”\n\nTesla and X owner Elon Musk, who is a vocal supporter of Trump, has used his social media platform to accuse the Federal Aviation Administration of blocking the flights of private disaster relief groups headed to North Carolina.\n\nReplying directly to Musk, Transport Secretary Pete Buttigieg said that no flights had been blocked. \n\n Members of the FEMA Massachusetts Task Force 1 conduct search and rescue in floodwaters caused by Hurricane Helene in North Carolina. Alamy Stock Photo\n\n Alamy Stock Photo\n\nRight-wing activists and fringe media sites have also spread claims that the government intends to bulldoze entire towns as part of a “land grab”, or that FEMA plans to take people’s homes from them.\n\nThis is playing on fears that did materialise in the wake of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, but in a more subtle way.\n\nMany social housing developments were demolished and replaced with private condominiums as land was snapped up by wealthy developers in a process the author Naomi Klein has called Disaster Capitalism. \n\nSpeaking about the rumours around the federal response in Republican states, FEMA administrator Deanne Criswell told MSNBC: “It’s frankly disappointing that we’re having to deal with this narrative.”\n\nCriswell said the fact that “there’s a few leaders that are having a hard time telling the difference between fact and fiction” has been impeding relief efforts.\n\nAccording to the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, some of the conpiracy theories spread online have been of an antisemitic nature and could lead to federal aid workers being the targets of attacks.\n\nWith recovery efforts from Hurricane Milton and Hurricane Helene still in the early stages and likely to take months if not years, the topic looks set to remain a major political issue right up until US voters go to the polls on 5 November. \n\nWith reporting from AFP\n\n The Journal’s FactCheck is a signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network’s Code of Principles.

But price problems persist","text":"(CNN) — America’s inflation continued to slow in September, reaching a fresh three-and-a-half-year low and coming in at a pace that’s similar to what was seen in 2017 and 2018, according to data released Thursday.\n\nThe Consumer Price Index, which measures price changes across commonly purchased goods and services, was 2.4% for the 12 months ended in September, slowing from a 2.5% annual rate in August, according to the latest Bureau of Labor Statistics report.\n\nThat’s less of a cooldown than economists were expecting – FactSet consensus estimates were for a 2.3% rise – however, inflation as measured by the CPI is at its slowest rate since February 2021.\n\nBut the latest snapshot also showed how challenging it is to rein in high inflation: Some price hikes remained stubborn, while other categories highlight how factors such as weather, disease and war could jolt costs higher — albeit likely temporarily.\n\nHigh inflation, rather, is “dying, but not dead,” noted Olu Sonola, Fitch Ratings’ head of US economic research.\n\nOn a monthly basis, prices rose 0.2%, in line with the advance in August but faster than economists’ projections of 0.1%.\n\nA jump in food prices — a sweeping bird flu has caused egg prices to spike — combined with ongoing, but easing, shelter-related inflation drove the overall CPI higher last month, despite falling gas prices, BLS said.\n\nStripping out food and energy costs, categories that are typically quite volatile, core CPI rose 0.3% in September, bringing the annual rate up to 3.3% after holding firm at 3.2% the past two months.\n\nSo that’s a mixed bag of data for the Federal Reserve to pore over as it considers whether to lower its interest rates again early next month.\n\n“September’s CPI report has good news and bad news for the Fed,” Eugenio Aleman, Raymond James’ chief economist, wrote in a note issued Thursday. “The good news is that shelter costs slowed down to 0.2%, month-on-month, and 4.9%, year-over-year. However, it also showed that there are still plenty of upside risks for inflation going forward.”\n\nStubbornly high housing inflation eases\n\nThe core CPI measurement was expected to be stubbornly high for the month, a reflection of persistent housing inflation and a handful of temporary lifts in prices for certain categories such as insurance, lodging costs and vehicle prices.\n\nStill, economists say that inflation is headed in the right direction, because the factors that pushed prices higher during the pandemic era have largely faded while demand has slowed to more normal levels.\n\nThe “shelter” category, which accounts for more than one-third of the overall CPI, has been the biggest obstacle to inflation’s descent. However, economists say it’s only a matter of time before that hurdle topples because of a lag in how rents and housing-related costs are tabulated.\n\nThursday’s report provided a glint of hope: Housing inflation slowed to its lowest annual rate since February 2022.\n\n“Shelter is the silver lining to all of this,” Tyler Schipper, associate professor of data analytics and economics at St. Thomas University in St. Paul, Minnesota. “It’s one data point, just like the pop up in food prices is a singular data point, but it’s at least a hopeful data point in terms of where [the Fed is] hoping shelter inflation goes. And that can be the main driver of what gets inflation actually back down in your 2% goal.”\n\nWhile it’s a waiting game for shelter inflation’s data mechanics to come back in line with what’s happening on the ground, Thursday’s CPI report showed that price pressures still sting for consumers in certain areas. And it also gave a hint of how large-scale events could cause short-term spikes in certain prices.\n\nNotably, egg prices jumped higher last month, this time by 8.4% as a deadly bird flu cripples supply. Annually, eggs are up 39.6%.\n\nHowever, overall grocery prices are running well below overall inflation and are up 1.3% for the year ended in September.\n\nRisks continue to persist\n\nStill, the outlook for overall inflation is much improved from where it was two weeks ago, when a massive dockworkers strike threatened to choke off supply at more than 30 US ports. That can was kicked down the road until at least mid-January as negotiations continue.\n\nStill, the aftershocks of devastating hurricanes, wars, geopolitical flare-ups, and even US policy actions could present risks to the current disinflationary path, economists say.\n\nIn the coming months, the category facing some of the greatest pressure could be energy prices, Satyam Panday, chief economist for S&P Global Ratings, told CNN.\n\n“Energy price is a key risk to our own baseline narrative of this disinflation,” he said. “So, it may not be a straight line of disinflation; it’s going to be a bumpy path to more normal.”\n\nThe biggest inflationary risk could come if Donald Trump is elected president and he is able to impose his plan of immense tariffs, Oliver Allen senior US economist for Pantheon Macroeconomics, told CNN.\n\nBut for now, the inflation outlook is looking positive, Allen said.\n\n“The vast majority of forces that pushed up inflation (commodity prices, strong labor market of wages and rehiring, rent spikes, consumer spending, large margins, loose monetary policy, and fiscal policies of the Trump and Biden administrations), they’ve all pretty much faded or are falling quite rapidly,” Allen said. “Although, you can’t rule out the effect you might see from some idiosyncratic price risk here or there.”\n\nOn deck: More data. And an election\n\nWith less than four weeks until Election Day, easing inflation pressure has also changed the conversation on the campaign trail.\n\nIn September, an estimated 79% of campaign ads for former President Donald Trump highlighted inflation, according to data from AdImpact. In the first week of October, just 10.5% of ads for Trump, the Republican candidate, mentioned inflation.\n\nBut for Vice President Kamala Harris, who served in an administration during which the cost of living rose the most in decades, the issue is still top of mind. On the eve of the new data, Harris unveiled a new ad outlining policies she’d pursue to keep bringing inflation down.\n\nThursday’s report was the last CPI to land before both the November presidential election and the Federal Reserve’s next policymaking meeting.\n\nOther key inflation data will follow: The latest read on wholesale inflation will land Friday; while the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, the most comprehensive look (and the Federal Reserve’s preferred gauge), will publish at the end of the month.\n\nThose likely will take a backseat to the October jobs report, which is due out November 1. With inflation mostly tamed and moving in the right direction, Fed officials have zeroed in on the health of the labor market.\n\nA robust jobs report for September helped ease fears that the US employment landscape was crumbling.\n\nThe October jobs report, although immensely critical, also will be quite noisy: The month’s employment numbers are likely to be depressed by an ongoing Boeing strike as well as the ripple effects from Hurricanes Helene and Milton.\n\nOn Thursday, a separate report from the Labor Department showed some hints of what’s to come: First-time claims for unemployment benefits spiked last week to their highest level since August 2023, a reflection of strike- and hurricane-related effects.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Thursday, Trump campaigned in Detroit, Michigan, where when he wasn’t busy insulting the city itself, he was tossing out a previously unannounced plan to make the interest on car loans tax-deductible. \n\nThis, of course, is nothing but pandering on Trump’s part, his lizard brain scrambling for something that would appeal to auto workers in a key swing state. \n\nIt’s telling that Trump didn’t propose anything that would directly change those workers’ lives for the better, such as improved safety protections or supporting strong unions as a bulwark against management. Instead, Trump, the man of the people, knows what auto workers crave: a tax break that would benefit rich people who buy expensive vehicles and would somehow magically trickle down to the workers who make those vehicles. \n\nIf this sort of thing sounds familiar, that’s because it is. When it comes to economic plans, Trump really has only one trick up his sleeve: tax relief. Well, he does have the whole “deporting millions will increase housing stock and therefore lower prices” idea, one that, besides being viciously racist, would tank the economy. Aside from that, all he’s got are vague ideas that tax credits and the like will somehow carry the election and save the economy. \n\nIt would be generous to call Trump’s car loan interest notion any more than a concept of a plan, but Trump is touting that it would “stimulate massive domestic auto production and make car ownership dramatically more affordable for millions and millions of working American families.” As one tax expert pointed out, this won’t help most people, as most Americans don’t itemize deductions as doing so isn’t typically greater than the standard deduction. \n\nBut you know who does itemize deductions? Rich people. \n\nUltimately, Trump’s idea is this: people will have so much spare cash from deducting car loan interest that they’ll buy new cars in droves, ushering in a renaissance of American car manufacturing. Since Trump has released no specifics on the plan, it’s anyone’s guess how this would happen.\n\nTrump’s plan to fix the staggering cost of long-term home health care is similarly light on details. Trump was forced to come up with something in response to Vice President Kamala Harris’ plan to expand Medicare to cover home health care costs. Costs for in-home health care are currently beyond the reach of many. Having an aide come in 40 hours per week costs almost $69,000 per year, and round-the-clock services can exceed $288,000. \n\nHome health care support would allow older adults to remain in their homes longer without resorting to a patchwork of unpaid care from family caregivers, many of whom have to quit their jobs to provide full-time care. The AARP estimates that caregivers provide $600 billion in unpaid care annually. A plan to cover these costs would be a game changer for millions. \n\nSo what would Trump do? Besides a substance-free statement that he would “take care of our seniors by shifting resources back to at-home senior care,” he would support “unpaid family caregivers through tax credits and reduced red tape.” \n\nSo, all the people who are currently trying to juggle their caregiving duties while also holding down a job and those who have had to quit a job to provide care will still have to do those things, but if they can white-knuckle it through another year, they’ll get to lower their tax bill. \n\nTrump’s other economic proposals, which are less proposals and more a product of Trump pandering to whatever audience he is in front of, are similarly tied to his love of tax cuts. He’s proposed eliminating taxes on Americans who live abroad, but given that overseas workers who make less than $126,500 already don’t have to pay, this is just another gift to rich people. \n\nHe’s also proposed getting rid of taxes on tips, overtime, and Social Security. Even if one pretends he’s sincere about that, those moves would blow a hole in the federal budget. Estimates for the cost of Trump’s tax giveaways range from $8.5 trillion to $9.75 trillion over the next ten years. Trump would fund these cuts by imposing massive tariffs. \n\nEven if one takes seriously the idea that the best plan for America is making consumer goods cost much more, the overall effects of this proposal benefit, of course, the rich. The Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy found that taxes would increase for all but the top 5% under Trump’s plan. \n\nNo one should be surprised that Trump, who managed to pay only $750 in income tax in 2017, despite reporting income of over $14 million that year, would fixate on tax abatement as What the People Really Want. However, regular folks can’t take advantage of the pro-business tax breaks that allow Trump to offset his considerable income with tax credits for his even more considerable business losses. \n\nNor did regular folks benefit from Trump’s massive 2017 tax cut, which made the extremely wealthy even more extremely wealthy but didn’t help the rest of us. A Harris presidency would instead focus on relief on issues affecting everyday Americans. In stark contrast, all a second Trump term guarantees is that the rich will get much, much richer.","summary":"Another day, another profoundly unserious economic proposal from Donald Trump.

During a recent Instagram Live session, Alabama, who recently turned 18, explained that she doesn’t feel educated on the candidates and, therefore, doesn't believe it's right to vote. She said, “It’s kinda immature if I talk about it and I’m not fully educated, but I do have an opinion, and I’ll keep it to myself. Not voting isn’t crazy, in my opinion, at all, because if I don’t feel like I have the exact education for what I’m voting for, how is it right for me to vote for something I’m not completely educated on?”\n\nAs per The Independent, she added that while she could educate herself on candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, she sees no point in doing so since she doesn’t have a strong interest in politics. In a futile attempt, she explained, “Why am I doing that if I genuinely really don’t care? I’m just honest. I don’t care to vote if I don’t know exactly what’s going on. I don’t think that’s wrong…I have an opinion on what I feel is right because of what I’ve been seeing. And just, like, I feel like one of the voters is just a mess. I mean, one of the – sorry – one of the people, the runners, candidates. See? I’m telling you, I’m not educated. I’m a little bit stupid.”\n\nAlabama's stance came as a shocker as the Kardashian family has always urged folks to vote, particularly during the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Khloé Kardashian, for instance, took to social media to dispute claims that her family hadn’t done enough to encourage voter participation. When a Twitter user suggested that Khloé and her family hadn’t used their massive influence to push for voter turnout, the reality star was quick to argue, \"My family and I have encouraged the importance of voting, registering to vote, and using your platforms. We have been posting for weeks...where people can register. Where people can vote. We have made it super simplistic/easy. Please be fully informed before you make untrue claims.\"\n\nIndeed, during the 2020 election, members of the Kardashian-Jenner family made significant efforts to urge their millions of followers to vote. Kim Kardashian posted, \"I VOTED!!!! Did you? If you are in line when the hours of operation close at the polls, they are required to stay open and allow you to vote, so do not get out of line!\" as reported by the E! News.\n\nMoreover, Khloé tweeted, \"I am seeing that so many people were unable to sleep because of the elections. Even people not from this country. Many are riddled with nerves. Try to take care of yourselves today. 30 minutes of praying or meditation may help. We will all get through this together. We have to.\"","summary":"Barker said, “I have an opinion on what I feel is right because of what I’ve been seeing...I’m telling you, I’m not educated.

The rule of law versus Donald Trump's lawlessness, kindness versus cruelty. If you are concerned about those things and are worried Harris could very well lose, well, do something,\" Brzezinski begged voters.\n\nMIKA BRZEZINSKI, 'MORNING JOE' CO-HOST: My attitude, if you will. So that's the thing, is this morning and also all week, we've been talking about the frustration among a lot of Democrats that maybe the message isn't breaking through to key voters. I mean, the polls seem so close every time a new one comes out, neck and neck.\n\nAnd there's this fear that Donald Trump is poised for victory. I think it's fair for Democrats to be incredibly depressed. I think it's fair for them to be discouraged.\n\nI think it's fair for them to explore whether Kamala Harris should be doing more. Feel free to do that. These things are all legitimate.\n\nI don't know what more she can do, especially given what happened, though, in 2016, because that was a trauma for anybody who loves this country and a trauma that didn't end that day. Obviously, Democrats want to make up for lost time as Kamala Harris has just days left to truly introduce herself to the American people. At the same time, it could be argued she's doing everything possible.\n\nRallies with tens of thousands of people, talk shows, radio, late night TV, podcasts, town halls are next. You can't claim she's not doing town halls. She wants to debate.\n\nShe's hitting the battleground states multiple times. She's sending her top surrogates out on the road for a four week blitz through swing states, including former presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, encouraging and winning over Republicans, including Liz Cheney, top military brass, top economic leaders, even members of Trump's own administration, trying to tell Americans that she is for them. The rule of law, the Constitution, that she's not a felon like her opponent, that she's not a con artist like her opponent, that she's not an adjudicated sexual abuser like her opponent, that she's not a person who devalues the truth like her opponent, that she's an honest broker who will do her best at this time of peril for the country.\n\nObviously, Democrats want to leave no stone unturned, and the Democratic National Committee even has this new ad about the danger of the undervote or those who may vote for Jill Stein. Just three percent of the vote. Take a look.\n\nAD: Jill Stein, Green Party candidate for president. So why are Trump's close allies helping her? Stein was key to Trump's 2016 wins in battleground states. She's not sorry she helped Trump win. That's why a vote for Stein is really a vote for Trump. Jill Stein, I like her very much. You know why? She takes 100 percent from them. I'm Kamala Harris, and I approve this message.\n\nSo sure, offer up all the ideas of what more Harris could be doing in these few remaining days before the election. At the same time, it's actually you, the American voter, who needs to step up.\n\nTruly look at the choice before us. Listen to Donald Trump's speeches. Truth over lies, democracy versus fascism or something like that looks like it.\n\nYour interests rather than revenge for Donald Trump's ego. The rule of law versus Donald Trump's lawlessness, kindness versus cruelty. If you are concerned about those things and are worried Harris could very well lose, well, do something.\n\nGet to work. As Barack Obama said in Pittsburgh last night, don't just sit back and hope for the best. Vote and help get out the vote.\n\nIf we care about this experiment called America, the search for a more perfect union that has the possibility of being ever more perfect every day. Don't despair. Don't be discouraged.\n\nI mean, you can be, but don't just be. Don't just criticize. And women, I'm talking to you because this is about getting back our 50 years of rights so our daughters can be safe at the doctor.\n\nWe know better. We know better than to wait for someone else to get this job done. We're women.\n\nWe always come through for each other. So let's not miss this opportunity to step up for women, for families across the United States of America. And if you're frightened by the option of Donald Trump, don't just talk about all the things you think the Harris camp is doing wrong.\n\nGet to work. I know women will. Lauren Leder, you're wonderful.\n\n Recommended\n\n \n\n Trump: I Hope Colorado Delivers A Protest Vote For Trying To Kick Me Off The Ballot, For What They've Done To Your Culture\n\n October 11, 2024\n\n Former President Donald Trump called on Colorado voters to deliver a protest vote at a rally in Aurora, Co. on Friday.\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: There's more enthusiasm today than ever before.

Ron DeSantis over the Democratic presidential nominee’s claims that the Florida governor ignored her call after the Sept. 26 storm.\n\n“This is gross,” Mostert told the outlet. “I truly can’t imagine sliding into someone’s DMs or commenting on somebody’s picture of their family talking about the skin color of my kids.”\n\n“I know who I am,” she said. “I know my heart. I know my family dynamic. I know my husband.

To me, that just seems ridiculous.”\n\nDespite the online trolling, Mostert said the majority of comments supported her stance and she’s also been commended by fellow NFL wives and girlfriends.\n\n“We all have each other’s backs,” she said.\n\nMostert said it’s more important to vote for someone who she believes will protect her kids’ futures “so I am OK with the backlash.”\n\nAnd as for Harris, she is “ill-equipped to be the next president of the United States,” she claimed.","summary":"The wife of NFL player Raheem Moster says she and her kids have received online hate after calling Vice President Kamala Harris \"textbook trash.\"","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/10/12/us-news/dolphins-star-raheem-mosterts-wife-receives-online-hate-after-calling-vp-harris-trash-report/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/wife-miami-dolphins-running-back-91512103.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/h0Kougrr-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-10-12 22:44:41","author":"Priscilla Degregory","authors":["Priscilla Degregory"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.298},{"id":259473736,"title":"Vance points out the 'biggest difference' between leadership of Trump, Harris during campaign stop","text":"Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, set the record straight on how former President Donald Trump's and Vice President Kamala Harris' leadership styles for America's veterans differ during a campaign stop in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, on Saturday. The Republican vice presidential nominee's rally was held at JWF Industries, which supplies \"Department of Defense prime contractors with reliable, on-time fabrications and sub-assemblies,\" according to its site. Vance, himself a Marine veteran, asked the crowd, \"When our own citizens suffer and our veterans are at the top of that list, [do] you know what a big difference between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris [is]?\" 'WE BELIEVE IN DONALD TRUMP': MORE THAN A DOZEN MEDAL OF HONOR RECIPIENTS ENDORSE FORMER PRESIDENT \"Donald Trump wants to put American citizens and American veterans first. He thinks the government of this country exists to serve the people of this country, not people who shouldn't be here in the first place,\" said Vance. \"That is one of the biggest differences between the leadership of Donald Trump and Kamala Harris.\" Vance's comments came on the heels of a question from a reporter asking how the Trump-Vance ticket would prioritize ending veteran homelessness in America, as Pennsylvania has the fourth-highest rate of veteran homelessness in the country. In late August, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) announced it would award over $800 million nationwide in grants through the Supportive Services for Veteran Families and Homeless Providers Grant and Per Diem programs, with $17 million of the overall grant going to Pennsylvania. According to nonprofit Mission Roll Call, an average of 35,574 veterans experienced homelessness per diem in 2023. Veteran homelessness increased 7.4% from 2022 to 2023 during the Biden administration, according to the VA. TRUMP CAMPAIGN SEEKS INCREASED SECURITY AS ELECTION DRAWS NEAR, INCLUDING MILITARY AIRCRAFT AMID IRAN THREATS \"Let's be honest here, $17 million,\" Vance said. \"While it will help, it is not nearly enough to meet the challenge of the homeless veteran population in this country. \"These guys went off to war. Some of them came back with wounds, some of them with wounds you cannot see. But all of them came back with the pride that they served their country and did what our country asked them to do,\" he added. \"How disgraceful is it that millions of our veterans are getting left behind in some form or another, and thousands of them are homeless? When we're housing illegal aliens in first-class hotels, it's a disgrace.\" In New York City alone, 119 migrant shelters contracted by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) are hotels and motels. An additional 38 hotels are contracted through different agencies. Veterans 4 America First Institute (V4AF), a self-described grassroots policy organization and nonprofit, responded to Vance's comments on Trump and Harris' differing approaches toward veterans. \"Senator Vance is 100% correct, more needs to be done for our homeless veterans, especially at a time under VP Harris when the Department of Veterans Affairs dropped the ball as veteran homelessness went up over 7% last year,\" Darin Selnick, V4AF founder and Air Force veteran, told Fox News Digital. \"Meanwhile, the VA gives special treatment to illegal immigrants by processing and paying their ICE medical claims and to special interests over veterans, such as what is happening at the West L.A. campus where VA has turned its back on homeless veterans while giving illegal leases to UCLA, Brentwood School and an oil company,\" continued Selnick. The VA was recently ruled against during a case in Los Angeles after it had been discovered that the organization had \"quietly sold off\" land deeded in 1888 as an Old Soldiers' Home to private interests instead of building housing units for veterans. U.S. Rep. Mike Bost, R-Ill., introduced a bill last December that would block VA funding for illegal immigrants nationwide called the \"No VA Resources for Illegal Aliens Act\" after reports came out of the DHS using VA funding for illegal migrants in ICE detention. Selnick added: \"It is time for VP Harris to walk the walk instead of just talking, and to do what is right for veterans instead of using veterans as a political prop.\" The Republican National Committee's official platform for 2024 includes a subsection titled \"Take Care of Our Veterans,\" saying, \"Republicans will end luxury housing and Taxpayer benefits for Illegal Immigrants and use those savings to shelter and treat homeless Veterans.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"We will restore Trump Administration reforms to expand Veterans' Healthcare Choices, protect Whistleblowers, and hold accountable poorly performing employees not giving our Veterans the care they deserve,\" the document continued.

Blood and Meg Kinnard | Associated Press\n\nCOACHELLA, Calif — With the presidency on the line in battlegrounds like Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, why would Donald Trump venture into California, one of the most solidly Democratic states, just weeks before Election Day?\n\nTrump is almost certain to lose California, and that won’t change after his scheduled Saturday stop in Coachella, a desert city east of Los Angeles best known for the annual music festival bearing its name. Still, there are practical reasons for him to visit, despite the Republican nominee’s prospects Nov. 5 in the most populous state.\n\nThe former president lost California in a landslide in 2020. He did get 6 million-plus votes, more than any GOP presidential candidate before, and his margins topped 70% in some rural counties that typically favor conservatives on the ballot.\n\nThat’s an enormous pool of potential volunteers to work on state races and participate in phone banks into the most contested states. And Trump is likely to draw extensive media coverage in the Los Angeles market, the second-largest in the country.\n\nTrump is visiting Coachella in between stops in Nevada, at a roundtable in Las Vegas for Latinos earlier Saturday — where he praised Hispanics as having “such energy” — and Arizona, for a rally Sunday in Prescott Valley. He narrowly lost those two swing states to Democrat Joe Biden in 2020.\n\nAttendees waiting in broiling temperatures that approached 100 degrees Saturday said they didn’t expect Trump to win their state but were thrilled to see him.\n\n“It’s like a convention of like-minded people,” Tom Gibbons of Palm Desert, who’s backed Trump since 2016 but been unable to see him in person until Saturday, said as he stood in line at a food truck on the polo fields that will house the crowd at the Coachella event. “Everybody understands the heartbeat of America, the plight of the working man. … It’s reassuring.”\n\nGoing to California gives Trump the “ability to swoop in and leverage this big population of Trump supporters,” said Tim Lineberger, who was communications director for Trump’s 2016 campaign in Michigan and also worked in the former president’s administration. He’s “coming here and activating that.”\n\nLineberger recalled Californians making calls to Michigan voters in 2016 on Trump’s behalf and said the campaign’s decision to go into safe, Democratic turf at this point was “an aggressive, offensive play.”\n\nCalifornia is also a fountain of campaign cash for both parties, and Trump will be fundraising. Photos with the former president in Coachella were priced at $25,000, which comes with special seating for two. A “VIP Experience” was priced at $5,000.\n\nWith congressional races in California in play that could determine which party controls the House, the Coachella rally “is a get-out-the-vote type of thing that motivates and energizes Republicans in California, when they are not as close to what is going on in the national campaign,” Republican consultant Tim Rosales said.\n\nRosales also said to look for Trump to continue his long-running spat with Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\nFor Republicans, “It’s motivating when you can pick at California a little bit and the governor … will take the bait,” Rosales said.\n\nNewsom on Wednesday predicted Trump would be denigrating the state at the rally, overlooking its strengths as the world’s fifth-largest economy. The governor said that for the first time in a decade, California has more Fortune 500 companies than any other state.\n\n“You know, that’s not what Trump is going to say,” he predicted.\n\nJim Brulte, a former chairman of the California Republican Party, said he thinks Trump is angling for something that has eluded him in previous campaigns: winning more total votes than his Democratic opponent.\n\n“I believe Donald Trump is coming to California because he wants to win not only in the Electoral College, but he wants to win the popular vote. There are more registered voters in California than there are residents in 46 of the other 49 states,” Brulte said.\n\nThe Trump National Golf Club Los Angeles sits on the Pacific Coast, south of the city. But Trump has long had a conflicted relationship with California, where a Republican has not carried the state since 1988 and Democrats outnumber registered Republicans by about 2-to-1.\n\nCalifornia was home to the so-called Trump resistance during his time in office, and Trump often depicts California as representing all he sees wrong in America. As president, he called the homeless crises in Los Angeles and San Francisco disgraceful and threatened to intercede.\n\nHe is likely to spend time on Saturday linking California’s problems to Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee and a San Francisco Bay Area native who was California’s attorney general and represented the state in the Senate.\n\nHis campaign issued a statement alleging that under Harris, “the notorious ‘California Dream’ has turned into a nightmare for everyday Americans.”\n\nJessica Millan Patterson, chairwoman of the state GOP, said she looked forward to hearing Trump contrast his agenda with a Democratic White House that “has left Californians less safe and with less money in their pockets.”\n\nRepublicans, she promised, “will do our part to secure a House majority.”\n\nTom Beaumont in Las Vegas contributed to this report.","summary":"With the presidency on the line in battlegrounds like Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, why would Donald Trump venture into California, one of the most solidly Democratic states, just weeks before Election Day?","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/10/12/why-is-donald-trump-campaigning-in-california-a-state-hes-almost-certain-to-lose/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Election_2024_Trump_75640.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-12 22:02:40","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.017},{"id":259471788,"title":"The Debrief: FEMA funding on illegal immigration versus hurricane recovery","text":"Washington Examiner Commentary Editor Conn Carroll joins Investigations Editor Sarah Bedford to discuss the accusation of Republicans spreading misinformation related to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the money it spent on illegal immigration versus hurricane recovery, the media strategy the Harris campaign had for tackling illegal immigration, and Vice President Kamala Harris pointing out what kind of cars the public will be able to drive.","summary":"Washington Examiner Commentary Editor Conn Carroll joins Investigations Editor Sarah Bedford to discuss the accusation of Republicans spreading misinformation related to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the money it spent on illegal immigration versus hurricane recovery, the media strategy the Harris campaign had for tackling illegal immigration, and Vice President Kamala Harris pointing out what [&#8230;]","url":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/the-debrief/3184803/debrief-fema-funding-illegal-immigration-versus-hurricane-recovery/","image":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Harris-Federal-Swamp-1-scaled.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-12 22:00:00","author":"Washington Examiner Staff","authors":["Washington Examiner Staff"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.094},{"id":259471624,"title":"Walz tramps through tall grass on pheasant hunting season opener but bags no birds","text":"MINNEAPOLIS -- Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Walz spent Saturday morning tramping through tall grass on the opening day of Minnesota's pheasant hunting season, giving the campaign a chance to highlight the governor's rural roots and love of outdoor sports. \n\nNeither Walz nor Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan managed to bag any pheasants as they hunted near Sleepy Eye, a town about 90 miles (145 kilometers) southwest of Minneapolis. But others in their parties shot six birds on a beautiful fall day, the governor's office said. \n\n“They can hide, they can get under the grass,” Walz could be heard saying as they searched for one downed bird.\n\nThe campaign of Vice President Kamala Harris has been openly confronting the question of whether some men are reluctant to vote for her because she’s a woman. Key supporters are starting to make more direct appeals to male voters, hoping to overcome sexism — and apathy — as Election Day approaches. Harris disclosed during her debate with former President Donald Trump last month that she's a gun owner.\n\nOn Friday, the Democratic ticket announced the launch of Hunters and Anglers for Harris-Walz, a national organizing program to engage sportspeople, conservationists and rural voters in key states.\n\nThe Trump campaign mocked the outing, accusing Walz of “desperately attempting to make up ground with male voters.” The campaign's statement also falsely said there were no guns in sight during the hunt, calling it “a sign of the future under a Harris-Walz administration.”\n\nWhile it's true that a 36-second video clip from MSNBC tweeted by the Trump campaign didn't show any guns, it was recorded before Walz and his party had donned their blaze orange safety vests and hats and and headed into the field after a safety briefing from a conservation officer. They held their shotguns raised to avoid endangering the energetic pointers and Labradors that tried to sniff out birds for the hunters.\n\nWhile Walz had a top rating from the National Rifle Association during his 12 years in Congress, he changed his positions on gun issues after a series of school shootings. As governor, he signed legislation in 2023 expanding background checks for gun transfers and a “red flag law” allowing courts to temporarily take firearms away from people judged to be in imminent risk of harming themselves or others. His wife, Gwen, has been a champion of gun safety legislation.\n\n“Sorry Tim, men aren’t voting for a gun grabber,” the Trump campaign tweeted from an official account.\n\nThe Minnesota Governor’s Pheasant Hunting Opener has been a tradition since 2011, patterned after the state’s older fishing and deer season opener celebrations. It rotates through host communities in the pheasant country of southern and western Minnesota. \n\nWalz went hunting the morning after attending a football game in Mankato, where he was once was an assistant coach.","summary":"The campaign is highlighting the governor's rural roots and love of outdoors.","url":"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/walz-tramps-tall-grass-minnesotas-pheasant-hunting-season-114752262","image":"https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/5c41c8e7-fd05-42a5-b234-73bea8e840f0/wirestory_6fcaf239867c20743efcaedfcd98029f_16x9.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-12 21:58:26","author":"Steve Karnowski Associated Press","authors":["Steve Karnowski Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.091},{"id":259471668,"title":"Kamala Harris' Doctor Releases Her 'Excellent' Health Summary as Donald Trump Declines to Share Recent Medical Report","text":"Kamala Harris’ doctor deemed her overall health “excellent” as her campaign aims to provide contrast to the limited medical information Donald Trump has shared throughout the years.\n\n On Saturday, Oct. 12, the White House published a medical report penned by the vice president’s physician, Dr. Joshua Simmons. \n\n In the two-page letter — which covers her entire medical history as well as specific figures from her most recent physical exam in April 2024 – Simmons stated that Harris, 59, “possesses the physical and mental resiliency required to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency.”\n\n The vice president “maintains a healthy, active lifestyle, despite her busy schedule,” Simmons wrote.

Ronny Jackson, R-Texas, who, before he was elected to Congress, was Trump’s physician at the White House. Jackson also treated Trump after the assassination attempt.\n\n“All have concluded he is in perfect and excellent health to be Commander in Chief,” Cheung said in a statement. The campaign press office provided links to some of Trump’s past medical reports. They included: https://tinyurl.com/yckc495b and https://tinyurl.com/4z27pk2f.\n\nIf Trump, who is 78, were to be elected next month, he would be the oldest president in U.S. history by the time his term ends in 2029.\n\nSimmons, who said he has been Harris’ primary care physician for the past 3 1/2 years, said the vice president has a history of seasonal allergies and urticaria, or hives. She has been able to “dramatically” improve her symptoms over the past three years with an immunotherapy medication that helps the body become less sensitive to allergens.\n\nSimmons said Harris’ latest blood work and other test results were “unremarkable.” Her blood pressure is not worryingly high and she is at low risk for heart disease.\n\nAccording to the summary of an exam conducted six months ago, Harris’ vital signs showed a blood pressure of 128 over 74, a heart rate of 78 beats per minute, pulse oximetry of 100% on room air with a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute and a temperature of 98.7 degrees. Pulse oximetry measures the amount of oxygen in a person’s blood.\n\nSimmons reported that Harris’ head, eyes, ears, nose and pharynx are normal.\n\nAlso in the report: Harris wears contact lenses for mild nearsightedness; her family history includes maternal colon cancer; she is up to date on preventive care recommendations, including having a colonoscopy and annual mammograms, as well as routine immunizations.\n\nHarris’ mother, Shyamala Gopalan, was 70 when she died of colon cancer in February 2009.\n\nThe vice president “maintains a healthy, active lifestyle, despite her busy schedule,” including “vigorous daily aerobic exercise and core strength training,” Simmons reported. She eats a healthy diet, does not use tobacco products and drinks alcohol “only occasionally and in moderation,” he wrote.\n\nAs Harris’ office released the medical report, her campaign highlighted recent media reports raising questions about Trump’s health and mental acuity and his reluctance to provide detailed information about the state of his health and medical history.\n\nTrump eagerly questioned President Joe Biden’s physical and mental fitness when the 81-year-old sought reelection. Since Biden dropped out of the race and was replaced by Harris on the Democratic ticket, Trump’s health has drawn more attention.\n\nLast November, Trump marked Biden’s birthday by releasing a letter from his physician that reported the former president was in “excellent” physical and mental health. The letter posted on Trump’s social media platform contained no details about his weight, blood pressure and cholesterol levels, or the results of any tests to support its claims.\n\nAssociated Press writer Nicholas Riccardi in Denver contributed to this report.","summary":"Vice President Kamala Harris is in \"excellent health\" and \"possesses the physical and mental resiliency\" required to serve as president, her doctor said in a letter released Saturday that summarizes her medical history and status.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/10/12/doctor-deems-harris-in-excellent-health-her-team-aims-to-contrast-with-trumps-scant-medical-info/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Election_2024_Harris_63567.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-12 21:53:30","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.183},{"id":259471192,"title":"Donald Trump says something terrible about Kamala Harris in a heated outburst at a gathering of billionaires","text":"Donald Trump called his opponent Kamala Harris ‘retarded’ as he lashed out at Republican donors at a private fundraiser, a new report claims.\n\nThe former president was giving a speech to some of the wealthiest Americans at Trump Tower in New York City on September 29 when things reportedly turned nasty.\n\nInstead of sweet talking them into opening their wallets, he tore into his backers for letting him fall behind Harris in fundraising all while eating steak and baked potatoes.\n\nThe vice president has raised more than $1 billion in the three months since she took over the race from President Joe Biden.\n\nThis is more than Trump raised the entire year, and in in addition to the cash on hand Biden’s campaign had when he dropped out on July 21.\n\nWhile Trump’s slur against Harris was the worst remark, but no one was spared his wrath, seven people there told the New York Times.\n\nRich donors had plenty of reasons to be grateful to him, he insisted, including lowering their taxes – though not all those listening agreed with that.\n\nTrump also complained about how many Jews supported Harris, given his hardline pro-Israel stance, and claimed they needed their heads examined.\n\nHe used the same phrase about Jews at many of his rallies, and claimed they would bear some of the blame if he lost the election.\n\nWealthy Republicans at the pricey dinner included hedge fund manager Paul Singer and investment banker Warren Stephens, both billionaires.\n\nHis former education secretary Betsy DeVos and her husband Dick was also there alongside Joe Ricketts and his son Todd – again, all billionaires.\n\nThe same moment Trump was insulting her, Harris was raising another $28 million at her own fundraiser at the JW Marriott in Los Angeles.\n\nTrump is no stranger to baselessly insulting his opponents’ mental acuity, doing it almost daily while Biden was still running against him.\n\nJust last month he called Harris ‘mentally impaired’ at a rally in Pennsylvania.\n\nHarris, by contrast, made a groveling apology after responding ‘well said’ to a long question from a voter who called Trump’s actions ‘mentally retarded’.\n\n‘That word and others like it aren’t acceptable.

Trump recently referred to his Democratic presidential nominee opponent Kamala Harris as “retarded,” according to The New York Times.\n\n Trump has been apparently becoming more frustrated as the election draws closer, and any semblance of decorum seems to be fading. This should be no surprise to anyone paying attention to the dude this country elected back in 2016 who has shown from the beginning that he has little respect for women, having been caught on tape back in 2005 saying as a celebrity he could “grab them by the pussy,” yet, SURPRISE, here we are.\n\n Per The Times, back in September the Republican presidential nominee had a dinner meeting at New York’s Trump Tower with donors that included some big wigs — billionaire hedge fund manager Paul Singer who finances Republican campaigns and pro-Israel causes, billionaire investment banker Warren Stephens, and billionaire Joe Ricketts and his son Todd among them. Rather than charming them, however, he berated them for not doing enough and disparaged his competition to boot, calling Harris “retarded” and whining about how many Jews were backing her, an apparent affront when he believes he’s done so much for the state of Israel.\n\n He also touted how much he’d done for those in the room, according to seven anonymous people The Times spoke to who had knowledge of the meal, noting he’d been great for the taxes of those in attendance, despite that not being the case for all. His financial stress has fed into his behavior: Harris has raised $1 billion in the less than three months she’s been a candidate — more than Trump has finagled in a year of campaigning.\n\n Trump has had to spend more time cow-towing to donors over rallying, according to the report due to security concerns, although he seems to be doing plenty of rallying with two rallies this weekend, and not spending as much time on the golf course. Still, his spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told the outlet money wasn’t a concern. “Kamala Harris has spent hundreds of millions of dollars and is still performing worse than any Democrat who has ever ran against President Trump. Meanwhile, President Trump is in a better financial position than ever before, and he’s leading in the polls,” she said.\n\n In late September, Trump also called Harris “mentally disabled” during one of his anti-migrant rally rants in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin.\n\n It’s not the first time he’s been publicly called out for referring to a woman as “retarded.” He had previously referred to Academy Award-winning actress Marlee Matlin as “retarded” while she was a contestant on his show The Apprentice in 2011, according to The Daily Beast’s 2016 report, where three anonymous longtime staffers said Trump “would regularly disrespect the actress and would even treat her as if she were mentally disabled.”\n\n He would, according to the report, insult her behind her back and also to her face. In one instance, he had written on a note one of the staffers found: “Marlee, is she retarded??” Another said he mocked her voice, and a different source outlined a time Trump was “insensitive” directly to Matlin, when he made a comment about her deafness while filming an episode.","summary":"There appears to be no bottom to the Republican presidential nominee's demeaning behavior toward women","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-calls-kamala-harris-retarded-donor-dinner-report-1235132681/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/TrumpinVegas-1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-12 21:51:59","author":"Althea Legaspi","authors":["Althea Legaspi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.567},{"id":259471174,"title":"Kamala Harris' Chances of Winning North Carolina as She Campaigns in State","text":"Polling shows Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, and former President Donald Trump, the GOP nominee, are neck-and-neck in the key swing state of North Carolina as Harris prepares to hold a campaign rally in the state on Sunday.As Harris prepares to visit the Tarheel State, FiveThirtyEight's poll tracker shows that as of Saturday afternoon Trump is narrowly ahead of Harris by just 0.9 points, with 48.2 percent support compared to her 47.3 percent.Harris will spend Saturday meeting with local Black elected, faith and community leaders at a restaurant in Raleigh, one of the state's largest cities. According to her campaign, she is also slated on Sunday to attend church in Greenville, a key part of a \"Souls to the Polls\" initiative designed to energize voter turnout before holding a campaign rally.The visit is part of a broader strategy to win over the state's diverse voter base, which includes Black and college-educated voters, as well as women who are concerned about the rollback of abortion protections.In addition, Harris' weekend rally will focus on the economy, a central issue in this year's election, as well as the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, which has become a political flashpoint with Trump and his allies condemning the Biden administration's response to the natural disaster.This weekend is Harris' second time in the battleground state after it was struck by Helene, which left hundreds dead and dealt massive damage to infrastructure when it ripped through the Southeast late last month.During a visit to the state last weekend, the vice president pledged ongoing federal support in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene as she has also been outspoken about ensuring that relief efforts are equitable and free from corporate price gouging.\"To any company or individual that is using this crisis to jack up prices through illegal fraud or price gouging, whether it be at the gas pump, the airport or the hotel counter, we will be monitoring and there will be a consequence,\" the vice president said at yesterday's briefing.Newsweek has reached out to Harris' and Trump's campaign via email for comment.While the state has a history of backing the Republican candidate for president, including narrowly voting for Trump in 2020, it has elected a Democratic governor in six of the last seven races and is now considered a key battleground state.Battleground states, including North Carolina, will play a key role in determining the result of this year's election due to the Electoral College, which awards each state a certain number of electoral votes based on population. A presidential candidate needs to secure 270 electoral votes for victory, and winning the national popular vote does not guarantee success. Surveys from battleground states may be more telling than those of national polls.The latest independent polls in North Carolina show Trump with a narrow lead. An Emerson College poll, which surveyed 1,000 likely voters from October 5 to 8, showed Trump up 1 point in the state (50 to 49 percent).A Wall Street Journal survey of 600 registered voters in each of the main swing states conducted between September 28 and October 8 shows that Trump is narrowly ahead in North Carolina (46 to 45 percent). In addition, he is narrowly ahead in Pennsylvania (46 to 45 percent).However, in that same poll Harris has a slight lead over Trump in four of the seven election battleground states including Arizona (47 percent to 45), Michigan (47 percent to 45), Wisconsin (46 percent to 45) and Georgia (46 percent to 45).It is thought that Harris' clearest path to victory in November would be to win the three blue wall battleground states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.Trump's most efficient path to 270 Electoral College votes would be to win the Sun Belt swing states of North Carolina and Georgia and flip Pennsylvania.","summary":"The vice president will hold a campaign rally in the swing state on Sunday amid Donald Trump narrowly polling ahead of her there.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/kamala-harris-chances-winning-north-carolina-holds-rally-1968153","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2494096/kamala-harris.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-12 21:47:23","author":"Natalie Venegas","authors":["Natalie Venegas"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.044},{"id":259470844,"title":"“Residents of Aurora, Colorado Share Impact of Venezuelan Gangs on Their Community”","text":"Migrant gang activity in Aurora, Colorado, is making residents feel threatened and some are avoiding the town all together because of it, locals told DailyMail.com. \n\nSpeaking to a crowd of thousands on Friday in Aurora, Colorado, Donald Trump hammered Joe Biden and Kamala Harris’s immigration policies, blaming them for local migrant gang activity.\n\nReports of the Venezuelan prison gang Tren de Aragua (TDA) operating in Aurora went viral in August after a video showed men with rifles and handguns threatening apartment residents before a 25-year-old man was shot and killed. \n\nColorado Gov. Jared Polis, however, has said TDA’s presence in the area does not surmount to a takeover or the ‘war zone’ Trump has described.\n\nBut the MAGA faithful who showed up to Trump’s rally Friday were adamant that safety in Aurora is worse off because of the gang activity. \n\nRecon, a Marine Corps veteran and Aurora resident, told DailyMail.com that the media has not been following the TDA gang activity close enough. \n\n‘I’m from Aurora Colorado, born and raised Denver Aurora. I went to the Marine Corps for eight years, and I came back home. As far as the migrant situation is concerned, I’m gonna be honest with you, the news and the media and Democrats are covering it up, because it’s bad for politics.’\n\nHe said the TDA gang activity is real and ‘it’s just spreading across the communities that they’re picking,’ noting how the gang activity is not happening in nicer areas. \n\n‘They’re not sending them to Highlands Ranch. They’re not sending them to Cherry Hills village. They’re not sending them to Boulder they’re not sending them to Fort Collins,’ Recon continued. \n\n‘So the facts of the matter is, they’re sending them to the black communities, which which is a conflict of interest considering that since the cost of inflation has went up, everything has gotten more expensive, and people can’t even pay for childcare.’\n\nCortney, another Aurora resident who lives 20 minutes from the apartment where the migrant gang activity was filmed, admitted ‘all of Aurora has just gone downhill.’\n\nShe said the national spotlight on the local issue has been a positive development as the gang activity has been occurring for a while\n\nBut said the problem is not specific just in her town.\n\n‘The majority of Colorado has been overrun between the homeless and the drugs and the illegal aliens,’ she added.\n\nWhen pressed on whether she has seen anything suspicious, Cortney said she had not seen anything firsthand but has been reading a lot about it on social media. \n\nAnother Colorado resident, Jen, told DailyMail.com: ‘Well, I have heard that they are taking over parts of Aurora. Oh, they’re also down in Denver, but I hear that they’re financing themselves through breaking into the gun stores and the jewelry stores.’\n\nThe Aurora Police Department has confirmed in recent weeks a sporting goods store was robbed by ‘four teen-aged Latino males,’ though the announcement did not specify whether or not they were migrants or involved with TDA. \n\nFurther, several Venezuelan migrants, one a suspected TDA member, robbed a Denver jewelry store at gun-point over the summer, according to the Justice Department.\n\n‘During the robbery, suspects pointed weapons at employees, struck several employees with their weapons, and took a large amount of gold and jewelry. The suspects were later located in the El Paso, Texas area,’ the DOJ memo said.\n\n‘They are definitely taking over the apartment buildings,’ one lifelong Colorado resident, Mark, told DailyMail.com, citing the now-viral video as evidence. \n\nHe lives in Bennett, Colorado, and he revealed that people in his town have been afraid to go Aurora because of the reports. \n\n‘Everybody talks about it.

Still, there are practical reasons for him to visit, despite the Republican nominee’s prospects November 5 in the most populous state.\nThe former president lost California in a landslide in 2020. He did get 6 million-plus votes, more than any Republican presidential candidate before, and his margins topped 70 per cent in some rural counties that typically favour conservatives on the ballot.\nThat’s an enormous pool of potential volunteers to work on state races and participate in phone banks into the most contested states. And Trump is likely to draw extensive media coverage in the Los Angeles market, the second-largest in the country.\nTrump is visiting Coachella in between stops in Nevada, at a round table in Las Vegas for Latinos earlier on Saturday – where he praised Hispanics as having “such energy” – and Arizona, for a rally Sunday in Prescott Valley. He narrowly lost those two swing states to Democrat Joe Biden in 2020.\n\nAttendees waiting in broiling temperatures that approached 38 degrees Celsius (100 degrees Fahrenheit) on Saturday said they didn’t expect Trump to win their state but were thrilled to see him.\n“It’s like a convention of like-minded people,” Tom Gibbons of Palm Desert, who’s backed Trump since 2016 but been unable to see him in person until Saturday, said as he stood in line at a food truck on the polo fields that will house the crowd at the Coachella event. “Everybody understands the heartbeat of America, the plight of the working man … It’s reassuring.”\nGoing to California gives Trump the “ability to swoop in and leverage this big population of Trump supporters”, said Tim Lineberger, who was communications director for Trump’s 2016 campaign in Michigan and also worked in the former president’s administration. He’s “coming here and activating that”.\nLineberger recalled Californians making calls to Michigan voters in 2016 on Trump’s behalf and said the campaign’s decision to go into safe, Democratic turf at this point was “an aggressive, offensive play”.\nCalifornia is also a fountain of campaign cash for both parties, and Trump will be fundraising. Photos with the former president in Coachella were priced at US$25,000, which comes with special seating for two. A “VIP Experience” was priced at US$5,000.\nWith congressional races in California in play that could determine which party controls the House, the Coachella rally “is a get-out-the-vote type of thing that motivates and energises Republicans in California, when they are not as close to what is going on in the national campaign”, Republican consultant Tim Rosales said.\n\nRosales also said to look for Trump to continue his long-running spat with Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom.\nFor Republicans, “It’s motivating when you can pick at California a little bit and the governor … will take the bait,” Rosales said.\nNewsom on Wednesday predicted Trump would be denigrating the state at the rally, overlooking its strengths as the world’s fifth-largest economy. The governor said that for the first time in a decade, California has more Fortune 500 companies than any other state.\n“You know, that’s not what Trump is going to say,” he predicted.\nJim Brulte, a former chairman of the California Republican Party, said he thinks Trump is angling for something that has eluded him in previous campaigns: winning more total votes than his Democratic opponent.\n“I believe Donald Trump is coming to California because he wants to win not only in the Electoral College, but he wants to win the popular vote. There are more registered voters in California than there are residents in 46 of the other 49 states,” Brulte said.\n\nThe Trump National Golf Club Los Angeles sits on the Pacific Coast, south of the city. But Trump has long had a conflicted relationship with California, where a Republican has not carried the state since 1988 and Democrats outnumber registered Republicans by about two to one.\nCalifornia was home to the so-called Trump resistance during his time in office, and Trump often depicts California as representing all he sees wrong in America. As president, he called the homeless crises in Los Angeles and San Francisco disgraceful and threatened to intercede.\nHe is likely to spend time on Saturday linking California’s problems to US Vice-President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee and a San Francisco Bay Area native who was California’s attorney general and represented the state in the Senate.\nHis campaign issued a statement alleging that under Harris, “the notorious ‘California Dream’ has turned into a nightmare for everyday Americans”.\nJessica Millan Patterson, chairwoman of the state Republican Party, said she looked forward to hearing Trump contrast his agenda with a Democratic White House that “has left Californians less safe and with less money in their pockets”.\nRepublicans, she promised, “will do our part to secure a House majority”.","summary":"The Republican US presidential candidate is taking a detour from swing states to launch an aggressive play on Democratic turf.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3282147/why-donald-trump-campaigning-california-state-hes-almost-sure-lose","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/10/13/ecb43f14-980f-4236-a78f-1131e69fa20b_bdc2c0b4.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-12 21:45:31","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.132},{"id":259470778,"title":"DJ Jackmaster dies at 38: Scottish musician Jack Revill suffered 'accidental head injury'","text":"Kim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSaturday, Oct 12th 2024\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRevealed: Alex Salmond collapsed after suffering 'heart attack' during lunch at conference in Macedonia - before witnesses desperately tried to revive him\n\nColeen Rooney signs huge I'm A Celebrity deal 'worth more than £1.5MILLION' - the biggest in the show's history... so will she spill the secrets on Wagatha Christie?\n\nKing Charles and Keir Starmer face demands to pay astonishing £200bn in reparations over UK's role in the slave trade\n\nKanye West accused of drugging and raping ex-assistant at Diddy party in bombshell lawsuit\n\nPETER HITCHENS: Stop worshipping MI5 - it's just a Blairite secret police force with a budget to boost\n\nHow Dele Alli is plotting one of football's greatest comebacks after two years on the sidelines with free agent's sights set on 2026 World Cup\n\nAs much-missed Dr Michael Mosley makes his final TV appearance, here are some simple, science-based tips from his bestselling book Just One Thing that could improve your life\n\nThe week Kamala's campaign collapsed!

He has even proposed taking a campaign bus tour across Pennsylvania and knocking on doors himself, in part to see how his money is being used.\n\nTaken together, a clear picture has emerged of Musk’s battle plan as he directs his efforts to elect Trump with the same frenetic energy and exacting demands that he has honed at his companies SpaceX, Tesla and X.\n\nAs early as February, Musk was speaking apocalyptically, in private, about what he considered the crucial need to defeat President Joe Biden. But even as he was meeting with advisers in Austin, Texas, in April to plot his super PAC, Musk sounded as if he considered Trump merely the lesser of two evils. He told friends in the spring that he wasn’t sure he even wanted to explicitly endorse Trump.\n\nThese days, in private conversations, Musk is obsessive, almost manic, about the stakes of the election and the need for Trump to win. He praises Trump’s courage under fire — he endorsed him on the night of the assassination attempt in Butler — and talks about how funny he is. One person who spoke recently to Musk recalled him saying, without any hint of irony, “I love Trump.”\n\nMusk’s frenzied engagement reflects his view of this moment in U.S. history. On X, he has warned in dire terms about the effects of progressive policies and censorship. He has claimed, without basis, that Democrats are trying to fill the country with immigrants in the country illegally who would reward them with permanent power, warning that the 2024 race could be the last free election in the U.S.\n\nIt may be impossible to capture the financial value of all the support Musk is providing to Trump. This is in part because of his role on X, where he amplifies so much of the former president’s message. Trump has privately used grand — and unverified — terms to describe what Musk is donating to the super PAC, telling one associate recently that the figure is $500 million.\n\nBut friends and colleagues say Musk is adopting the same strategy he has used during other crises he has considered existential. Just as Musk worked late into the night as his companies teetered on the verge of catastrophe, tinkering with rocket designs at SpaceX, sleeping on a couch in the Tesla factory or making staff cuts at Twitter, Musk has deemed this an all-hands-on-deck moment.\n\nAnd so, just as he recruited friends, family and trusted lieutenants to Twitter after he bought the company, Musk has done the same at America PAC, which he founded to help Trump. Most recently, Musk added Steve Davis, a former SpaceX engineer and the head of his tunneling company, to the group, with Davis reprising a sidekick role that he played after Musk’s takeover of Twitter.\n\nEnsconced in a war room in Pittsburgh with a team of lawyers, public-relations professionals, canvassing experts and longtime friends, Musk is trying to apply strategies and entrepreneurial lessons from his businesses to a grind-it-out political mission with just weeks to go until Election Day. This article is based on interviews with 17 people familiar with Musk’s thinking and operations as Election Day approaches.\n\n“I’m not sure there is a precedent in modern history to how Musk has inserted himself into the presidential race,” said Benjamin Soskis, a historian of the ultrarich.\n\nThe relationship between Trump and Musk has evolved over time.\n\nMusk, who once privately called Trump a “stone-cold loser,” possesses in abundance the things Trump values most: wealth, fame and a massive platform.\n\nMusk initially supported Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida for president and suggested that Trump should “sail into the sunset.” Trump replied that Musk begged on his knees for government subsidies. Still, Trump has remained fascinated by Musk.\n\nAmerica PAC declined to comment, and the Trump team declined to provide a comment for this story. Musk did not return a request for comment.\n\n Secret Support, at First \n\nThe idea for the super PAC was born out of two exclusive dinners. After DeSantis flamed out of the Republican primary, Musk began to tell friends that he wanted to find a way to support Trump — secretly.\n\nAt one dinner this year with a group of Trump-friendly billionaires including Nelson Peltz and John Paulson, Musk voiced an earnest, if naive, belief in the way that politics should work. He dismissed the power of television advertising and spoke sweepingly of an organic movement to elect Trump, with supporters persuading others to join the cause. Two voters by two voters — that was how Trump would win, he said.\n\nIn April, Musk arranged for a dinner to be held at the Los Angeles home of venture capitalist David Sacks. There, Musk and a phalanx of some of the world’s wealthiest people — including Rupert Murdoch, former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and onetime Trump supporter Peter Thiel — said that 10 by 10 voters was how Trump would win. Musk told about a dozen dinner companions that supporting Trump would be politically safe if they did it in large numbers — and so it was important for the businesspeople to organize their peers.\n\nTrump has made clear that he appreciates the help, promising to appoint Musk to oversee a government-efficiency team if he is reelected. At a rally in Reading, Pennsylvania, on Wednesday night, Trump appeared preoccupied with Musk, telling stories about his talks with Musk in three unrelated tangents and celebrating the “dark MAGA” hat that some attendees said they had bought because Musk wore it in Butler.\n\nThe relationship has proved significant in other ways. After a reporter’s publication of hacked Trump campaign information last month, the campaign connected with X to prevent the circulation of links to the material on the platform, according to two people with knowledge of the events. X eventually blocked links to the material and suspended the reporter’s account.\n\n 1 million voters \n\nAt the core of Musk’s project is America PAC, an organization that the Trump campaign is relying on for significant help in knocking on doors in battleground states and encouraging 800,000 to 1 million voters to cast ballots for the former president.\n\nThe group has spent about $80 million to help Trump, according to federal records, primarily on its canvassing program. Musk’s advisers have told donors that the group has about 2,500 organizers in the field, and the group has effectively acquired the Wisconsin assets of another group, Turning Point USA, taking on about 200 new canvassers in the state. Some canvassers, during training, have been shown Musk’s social media posts about the group, as a way to encourage them.\n\nThe scale of Musk’s personal financial commitment will not be made public until the middle of the month. Initially, Musk and his friends in the group had spoken of a budget totaling from $140 million to $180 million, almost all it from Musk himself. The group has told other prospective donors in recent weeks that it is fully funded.\n\nThe Trump campaign is conducting something of an experiment by outsourcing portions of its voter contact operation to America PAC and other groups. That is possible because of new federal election guidance that allows political campaigns to coordinate their activities more closely with outside organizations.\n\nThe campaign signed a data-sharing agreement with America PAC and several others, and it works closely with them to assess which voters are most important to speak to at their homes.\n\nStill, some people in Trump’s orbit are uncertain about how effective the outside efforts will be. Some donors to the super PAC have groused that Musk is relying on the same team that formed the core of DeSantis’ advisers when he attempted a similar effort in the Republican primaries, to no avail.\n\nVeterans of past campaigns argue that canvassing operations generally take months or even years to become effective machines. There is little precedent for successfully standing up a group of this scale just months before a presidential election.\n\nAnd turmoil has plagued America PAC at times, as Musk has repeatedly jettisoned advisers and vendors that were supplying canvassers and replaced them, at one point stranding hundreds of paid door-knockers across the country.\n\nA senior Trump campaign official, who was granted anonymity to discuss internal views about America PAC, said the team was not “relying” on the group but did consider it a “key” partner, along with many other outside groups, as “added firepower.”\n\n Spreading Misinformation \n\nIf America PAC is the most ambitious and costly manifestation of Musk’s support for Trump, nowhere has his cheerleading been more evident than on X.\n\nSince publicly endorsing the former president in July, he has posted at least 109 times about Trump and the election. And while he has said in the past that the platform should be “politically neutral,” he has used it to advance election misinformation and the baseless claim that Democrats are engaging in “deliberate voter importation” and “fast-tracking” immigrants to citizenship to gain control over the electorate.\n\nOne post with that claim this month has garnered nearly 34 million views, according to X’s own metrics, underscoring the scale of attention that Musk, owner of the platform’s most-followed account, can command.\n\n“Unless Trump wins and we get rid of the mountain of smothering regulations (that have nothing to do with safety!), humanity will never reach Mars,” Musk wrote this month in a post that has gained nearly 18 million views. “This is existential.”\n\nOnline, Musk has painted a dark picture of what would happen if Trump lost, a circumstance that could hurt Musk personally. In an interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, he acknowledged “trashing Kamala nonstop” and being all in for Trump.\n\nIf Trump loses, he joked, “how long do you think my prison sentence is going to be?”\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.\n\n© 2024 The New York Times Company","summary":"In the final weeks of the presidential campaign, the richest man in the world has involved himself in the U.S. election in a manner unparalleled in modern history.","url":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2024/10/12/breaking-news/musk-is-going-all-in-to-elect-trump/","image":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/web1_20241012_brk_msk01.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-12 21:30:00","author":"New York Times","authors":["New York Times"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.012},{"id":259471090,"title":"From Tim Walz to Will Rollins to Kipp Mueller, Democrats can’t help but inflate their resumes","text":"In a perfect world voters would evaluate candidates for office based on their credentials and comprehension of the subject matter that is impacted by the office they’re seeking.\n\nIn theory, candidates for water board should know something about water, school board aspirants should be well versed in public education, and wannabe insurance commissioners should be very familiar with that industry.\n\nSadly, more often than not, the opposite is true.\n\nIn times of hyper-partisanship, voters assume you are competent if your belief system aligns with theirs.\n\nCredentials be damned.\n\nIn fact, modern social science research backs this claim up.\n\nIn the Journal of Electoral Studies, political scientist Frederico Vegetti pooled a data set of European Election Studies from 1994 to 2009 and found that partisans are more likely to view their preferred party as the most competent and ideologically close when the environment is polarized.\n\nVegetti concluded, “as polarization increases, so does the collinearity between ideological and competence assessments.”\n\nIt’s a heck of a way to choose your government, but that’s what voters want.\n\nAnd that’s why it’s so strange that candidates keep lying about their portfolios.\n\nPoliticians running for office are like guys on a bad first date: “Yeah, I finished first in my class at Harvard Law School…my family is really rich…I’m a combat veteran…I speak seven languages…I invented Spanxx.”\n\nYou know who should really run for office? That talented Mr. Ripley guy.\n\nDemocratic Vice Presidential candidate Tim Walz stepped on this rake almost immediately after being selected by Vice President Kamala Harris to be her running mate, related to claims that he “served in war.”\n\nIn a 2018 video circulated by the Harris campaign in August, Walz referred to weapons “that I carried in war” while explaining his support for an assault weapons ban.\n\n“We can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, are only carried in war,” Walz said in the video.\n\nProblem is, that never happened.\n\nLauren Hitt, a Harris campaign spokesperson, said in a statement the governor “misspoke” in the clip.\n\n“Governor Walz would never insult or undermine any American’s service to this country — in fact, he thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country. It’s the American way…In making the case for why weapons of war should never be on our streets or in our classrooms, the governor misspoke,” Hitt said.\n\nSure. First Walz said he “misspoke” about his make-believe war experiences, then he said it was all a grammatical error. In other words, he’s lying about his lying.\n\nWill Rollins, a Democratic candidate for congress in the Corona and Palm Springs-based 41st congressional district is another liar-liar-pants-on-fire. He got caught lying about his occupation.\n\nRollins claimed to be a “counter-terrorism attorney,” as opposed to a regular, terrorist attorney.\n\nOr as I call them, a “car-bomb chaser.”\n\nUltimately, a court ruled that the Western Riverside County Walter Mitty did not truthfully describe what he does for a living.\n\n“There is no evidence before the Court that Rollins’ current principal profession can be accurately described as ‘counterterrorism attorney’” and that “the designation of ‘counterterrorism attorney’ and ‘counterterrorism advisor’ would be confusing or misleading to the voters, and therefore are not permissible ballot designations pursuant to Elections Code section 13107.”\n\nRollins was subsequently forced to change his ballot designation.\n\nThen there’s the Santa Clarita-based 23rd state senate district, where Democratic candidate Kipp Mueller claimed on his campaign website that he “served in President Obama’s Department of Justice in the Consumer Protection Branch, and joined the Santa Clara District Attorney’s Office to protect the community from sexual predators and fraudsters.”\n\nMuller reiterated these claims, and expanded on the details, in various public forums.\n\nAs it turns out, Mueller’s claim that he prosecuted fraudsters turned out to be fraudulent.\n\nHey, don’t they teach irony in law schools anymore?\n\nAs a result, the editorial board of this newspaper concluded Mueller’s false claims were “not a good look for someone asking the public to trust him to represent them. It casts real doubt about his judgment and his ability to be honest with the public.”\n\nHere’s a memo to current and aspiring politicians: Stop lying about your credentials! You’re likely to get caught, and nobody cares anyway.\n\nAs much as I hate the Internet sometimes, it’s made it a lot harder for charlatans to fabricate phony life stories.\n\nSo thanks, Al Gore!\n\nI would also note that we live in a time when RFK, Jr. endorsed Donald Trump and Dick Cheney endorsed Kamala Harris. So maybe old-school partisanship is on the way out.\n\nIncidentally, whichever of those two guys you used to hate you love now, and whichever one you loved you now hate. Maybe jot that down.\n\nJohn Phillips can be heard weekdays from noon to 3 p.m. on “The John Phillips Show” on KABC/AM 790.","summary":"You know who should really run for office?  That talented Mr. Ripley guy.  ","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2024/10/12/from-tim-walz-to-will-rollins-to-kipp-mueller-democrats-cant-help-but-inflate-their-resumes/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/LDN-L-ELX-VG-SSEND23MUELLER.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-12 21:26:17","author":"John Phillips","authors":["John Phillips"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.402},{"id":259470684,"title":"Why is Donald Trump campaigning in California, a state he’s almost certain to lose?","text":"COACHELLA, Calif (AP) — With the presidency on the line in battlegrounds like Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, why would Donald Trump venture into California, one of the most solidly Democratic states, just weeks before Election Day?\n\nTrump is almost certain to lose California, and that won’t change after his scheduled Saturday stop in Coachella, a desert city east of Los Angeles best known for the annual music festival bearing its name. Still, there are practical reasons for him to visit, despite the Republican nominee’s prospects Nov. 5 in the most populous state.\n\nThe former president lost California in a landslide in 2020. He did get 6 million-plus votes, more than any GOP presidential candidate before, and his margins topped 70% in some rural counties that typically favor conservatives on the ballot.\n\nThat’s an enormous pool of potential volunteers to work on state races and participate in phone banks into the most contested states. And Trump is likely to draw extensive media coverage in the Los Angeles market, the second-largest in the country.\n\nTrump is visiting Coachella in between stops in Nevada, at a roundtable in Las Vegas for Latinos earlier Saturday — where he praised Hispanics as having “such energy” — and Arizona, for a rally Sunday in Prescott Valley. He narrowly lost those two swing states to Democrat Joe Biden in 2020.\n\nAttendees waiting in broiling temperatures that approached 100 degrees Saturday said they didn’t expect Trump to win their state but were thrilled to see him.\n\n“It’s like a convention of like-minded people,” Tom Gibbons of Palm Desert, who’s backed Trump since 2016 but been unable to see him in person until Saturday, said as he stood in line at a food truck on the polo fields that will house the crowd at the Coachella event. “Everybody understands the heartbeat of America, the plight of the working man. … It’s reassuring.”\n\nGoing to California gives Trump the “ability to swoop in and leverage this big population of Trump supporters,” said Tim Lineberger, who was communications director for Trump’s 2016 campaign in Michigan and also worked in the former president’s administration. He’s “coming here and activating that.”\n\nLineberger recalled Californians making calls to Michigan voters in 2016 on Trump’s behalf and said the campaign’s decision to go into safe, Democratic turf at this point was “an aggressive, offensive play.”\n\nCalifornia is also a fountain of campaign cash for both parties, and Trump will be fundraising. Photos with the former president in Coachella were priced at $25,000, which comes with special seating for two. A “VIP Experience” was priced at $5,000.\n\nWith congressional races in California in play that could determine which party controls the House, the Coachella rally “is a get-out-the-vote type of thing that motivates and energizes Republicans in California, when they are not as close to what is going on in the national campaign,” Republican consultant Tim Rosales said.\n\nRosales also said to look for Trump to continue his long-running spat with Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\nFor Republicans, “It’s motivating when you can pick at California a little bit and the governor … will take the bait,” Rosales said.\n\nNewsom on Wednesday predicted Trump would be denigrating the state at the rally, overlooking its strengths as the world’s fifth-largest economy. The governor said that for the first time in a decade, California has more Fortune 500 companies than any other state.\n\n“You know, that’s not what Trump is going to say,” he predicted.\n\nJim Brulte, a former chairman of the California Republican Party, said he thinks Trump is angling for something that has eluded him in previous campaigns: winning more total votes than his Democratic opponent.\n\n“I believe Donald Trump is coming to California because he wants to win not only in the Electoral College, but he wants to win the popular vote. There are more registered voters in California than there are residents in 46 of the other 49 states,” Brulte said.\n\nThe Trump National Golf Club Los Angeles sits on the Pacific Coast, south of the city. But Trump has long had a conflicted relationship with California, where a Republican has not carried the state since 1988 and Democrats outnumber registered Republicans by about 2-to-1.\n\nCalifornia was home to the so-called Trump resistance during his time in office, and Trump often depicts California as representing all he sees wrong in America. As president, he called the homeless crises in Los Angeles and San Francisco disgraceful and threatened to intercede.\n\nHe is likely to spend time on Saturday linking California’s problems to Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee and a San Francisco Bay Area native who was California’s attorney general and represented the state in the Senate.\n\nHis campaign issued a statement alleging that under Harris, “the notorious ‘California Dream’ has turned into a nightmare for everyday Americans.”\n\nJessica Millan Patterson, chairwoman of the state GOP, said she looked forward to hearing Trump contrast his agenda with a Democratic White House that “has left Californians less safe and with less money in their pockets.”\n\nRepublicans, she promised, “will do our part to secure a House majority.”\n\nTom Beaumont in Las Vegas contributed to this report.\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 The Associated Press.

A “VIP Experience” was priced at $5,000. \n\nWith congressional races in California in play that could determine which party controls the House, the Coachella rally “is a get-out-the-vote type of thing that motivates and energizes Republicans in California, when they are not as close to what is going on in the national campaign,” Republican consultant Tim Rosales said.\n\nRosales also said to look for Trump to continue his long-running spat with Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\nFor Republicans, “It’s motivating when you can pick at California a little bit and the governor … will take the bait,” Rosales said.\n\nNewsom on Wednesday predicted Trump would be denigrating the state at the rally, overlooking its strengths as the world’s fifth-largest economy. The governor said that for the first time in a decade, California has more Fortune 500 companies than any other state.\n\n“You know, that’s not what Trump is going to say,” he predicted.\n\nJim Brulte, a former chairman of the California Republican Party, said he thinks Trump is angling for something that has eluded him in previous campaigns: winning more total votes than his Democratic opponent.\n\n“I believe Donald Trump is coming to California because he wants to win not only in the Electoral College, but he wants to win the popular vote. There are more registered voters in California than there are residents in 46 of the other 49 states,” Brulte said.\n\nThe Trump National Golf Club Los Angeles sits on the Pacific Coast, south of the city. But Trump has long had a conflicted relationship with California, where a Republican has not carried the state since 1988 and Democrats outnumber registered Republicans by about 2-to-1.\n\nCalifornia was home to the so-called Trump resistance during his time in office, and Trump often depicts California as representing all he sees wrong in America. As president, he called the homeless crises in Los Angeles and San Francisco disgraceful and threatened to intercede.\n\nHe is likely to spend time on Saturday linking California's problems to Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee and a San Francisco Bay Area native who was California's attorney general and represented the state in the Senate.\n\nHis campaign issued a statement alleging that under Harris, “the notorious ‘California Dream’ has turned into a nightmare for everyday Americans.”\n\nJessica Millan Patterson, chairwoman of the state GOP, said she looked forward to hearing Trump contrast his agenda with a Democratic White House that “has left Californians less safe and with less money in their pockets.”\n\nRepublicans, she promised, “will do our part to secure a House majority.”\n\n© Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Ronny Jackson, R-Texas, who, before he was elected to Congress, was Trump's physician at the White House. Jackson also treated Trump after the assassination attempt.\n\n“All have concluded he is in perfect and excellent health to be Commander in Chief,” Cheung said in a statement. The campaign press office provided links to some of Trump's past medical reports. They included: https://tinyurl.com/yckc495b and https://tinyurl.com/4z27pk2f\n\nIf Trump, who is 78, were to be elected next month, he would be the oldest president in U.S. history by the time his term ends in 2029.\n\nSimmons, who said he has been Harris’ primary care physician for the past 3 1/2 years, said the vice president has a history of seasonal allergies and urticaria, or hives. She has been able to “dramatically” improve her symptoms over the past three years with an immunotherapy medication that helps the body become less sensitive to allergens.\n\nSimmons said Harris’ latest blood work and other test results were “unremarkable.” Her blood pressure is not worryingly high and she is at low risk for heart disease.\n\nAccording to the summary of an exam conducted six months ago, Harris' vital signs showed a blood pressure of 128 over 74, a heart rate of 78 beats per minute, pulse oximetry of 100% on room air with a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute and a temperature of 98.7 degrees. Pulse oximetry measures the amount of oxygen in a person's blood.\n\nSimmons reported that Harris' head, eyes, ears, nose and pharynx are normal.\n\nAlso in the report: Harris wears contact lenses for mild nearsightedness; her family history includes maternal colon cancer; she is up to date on preventive care recommendations, including having a colonoscopy and annual mammograms, as well as routine immunizations.\n\nHarris' mother, Shyamala Gopalan, was 70 when she died of colon cancer in February 2009.\n\nThe vice president “maintains a healthy, active lifestyle, despite her busy schedule,” including “vigorous daily aerobic exercise and core strength training,\" Simmons reported. She eats a healthy diet, does not use tobacco products and drinks alcohol “only occasionally and in moderation,” he wrote.\n\nAs Harris' office released the medical report, her campaign highlighted recent media reports raising questions about Trump's health and mental acuity and his reluctance to provide detailed information about the state of his health and medical history.\n\nTrump eagerly questioned President Joe Biden's physical and mental fitness when the 81-year-old sought reelection. Since Biden dropped out of the race and was replaced by Harris on the Democratic ticket, Trump's health has drawn more attention.\n\nLast November, Trump marked Biden's birthday by releasing a letter from his physician that reported the former president was in “excellent” physical and mental health. The letter posted on Trump’s social media platform contained no details about his weight, blood pressure and cholesterol levels, or the results of any tests to support its claims.\n\nAssociated Press writer Nicholas Riccardi in Denver contributed to this report.\n\n© Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

During a recent campaign stop for Harris in Pittsburgh on Thursday, Obama addressed the vice president's dwindling support among Black voters, especially Black men. \"Now, I also want to say that that seems to be more pronounced with the brothers. So if you don't mind, just for a second, I've got to speak to y’all and say that when you have a choice, that is this clean: When on the one hand, you have somebody who grew up like you, went to college with you, understands the struggles [and the] pain and joy that comes from those experience,\" Obama said. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Obama even suggested that these voters aren't currently supporting Harris because she is a woman. Obama did not at any point acknowledge that the lesser support may be because of her record as vice president and deeper career history as a prosecutor. \"I’m speaking to men directly — part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren’t feeling the idea of having a woman as president, and you’re coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that,\" Obama said. Walker is one of many public figures, on both sides of partisan lines, who have criticized Obama for his comments this week. [Barack Obama], you forgot how hard we fought for our right to vote! Telling us how to vote based on color is a step backward. The bad policies of Biden/Harris have hurt us all. We need unity brother, not division!\" Walker wrote in a post on X on Saturday. Walker is a former all-American football running back who played in the NFL for 12 seasons. Prior to that, he played for the upstart USFL league that intended to compete with the NFL. Former president Trump was an investor in the league and the owner of the league's New Jersey Generals franchise, that Walker played for. NFL WIFE DEVON MOSTERT RECEIVES RACIST HATE ONLINE FOR DEFENDING DESANTIS AGAINST HARRIS Walker is most known for being part of one of the most iconic trades in NFL history in 1989. The trade sent Walker from the Dallas Cowboys to the Minnesota Vikings, in exchange for players and NFL Draft picks that the Cowboys used to build a team that won three Super Bowls in four years from 1992 to 1995. In 2022, Walker won the Republican Senate nomination in Georgia by an overwhelming majority of the vote after receiving the endorsement of Trump. However, the race between Walker and first-term Sen. Warnock went to a runoff, because neither candidate received a majority vote in the general election. Warnock ended up winning in the runoff. Still, despite losing, Walker has been a vocal proponent of other right-wing figures and principles, and he has been a vocal advocate for Trump during this election cycle. Walker also has a brief history of political interactions with Obama as well. The former president went on a long tirade mocking the former running back during a speech in Georgia ahead of the 2022 midterm elections. Obama said that Walker was \"someone who carries around a phony badge and says he is in law enforcement like a kid playing cops and robbers,\" and has a \"habit of not telling the truth.\" Obama even suggested that Walker would be so loyal to Trump, \"it means he is not going to be really thinking about you or your needs.\" Walker pushed back on Obama’s comments in a statement days later. \"President Obama was here last night. He said I’m a celebrity. He got that one wrong, didn’t he? I’m not a celebrity, I’m a warrior for God,\" Walker said. \"He needs some help, because he got with the wrong horse. Senator Warnock is the wrong horse. You know he can’t do the job, and it’s time for him to leave.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Now, Walker has taken another shot at Obama in a week of very poor press for the 44th president.

By contrast, Joe Biden won 92 percent of the Black vote in 2020.

(Anthony Souffle/The Minnesota Star Tribune)\n\nSPRINGFIELD, MINN. — Gov. Tim Walz sat on the tailgate of a red pickup on Saturday afternoon, eating venison and talking about hunting dogs.\n\nIt could’ve been any other October morning for the Minnesota Governor’s Pheasant Hunting Opener. The only difference, this year, was the roughly two dozen reporters watching him.\n\nAnd the Secret Service team.\n\nOh, right, and a pool of digital influencers waiting to chat with him.\n\nThat’s because, two months ago, Walz became part of the eye of the nation’s political storm when Vice President Kamala Harris picked him as her running mate for the White House. He’s rarely been back in Minnesota since then.\n\nHis weary staff members stood along the sidelines of Saturday’s hunt in rural Brown County, trading tales of trekking to multiple states a day, living out of hotels and growing accustomed to metal detector scans by the Secret Service.\n\nGov. Tim Walz takes a campaign break for the Minnesota Pheasant Hunting Opener on Saturday.\n\nOn Friday night, Walz’s team attended the high school football rivalry game in Mankato, watching his Mankato West High School Scarlets pick up a victory.\n\nOn Saturday morning, the governor arrived wearing a blaze orange hunting cap and toting a Beretta shotgun in quest of a pheasant. Unfortunately, for the hunting party, which included landowner Matt Kucharski, Nobles County Pheasants Forever Chapter President Scott Rall and Pheasants Forever CEO Marilyn Vetter, Walz didn’t get a bird. He didn’t even fire a shot during his time walking through the tall grass.\n\nBut Walz, — whose prowess around rural subject matter, from hunting to tinkering with vintage vehicles, has been touted by the campaign — let other hunters know when a pheasant flushed out by the inexhaustible dogs was a hen, which they couldn’t legally shoot, not a rooster.\n\nWhen a rooster did burst from the thicket and soared over the press corps, all dutifully wearing orange vests, Walz raised his shotgun vertically, making a joke about the infamous hunting mishap in 2006 when Vice President Dick Cheney shot a hunting partner in the face.\n\n“Every vice president joke that was ever made was about to be made right there,” Walz said to laughter from the crowd.\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nWalz campaigns on new benefits passed in Minnesota’s 2023 legislative session\n\nGov.

He has bagged birds at past governor hunts.\n\n“Early season discipline in the long run,” Walz said. “It was tempting [to take a shot at the bird], but it was too far.”\n\nLast month, Cheney said he would vote for the Harris-Walz ticket.\n\nLt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan also hunted during the opener; according to the Associated Press. She didn’t bag a pheasant, but others in their parties got six.\n\nAfter two hours of hunting, and a change of dogs, Walz’s team returned to the farm site for a interview with social media influencers. While the governor avoided talk of politics on the hunt, Walz did speak with Vetter about a stalled farm bill in Congress.\n\n“We passed three of them, and we did it [in a] bipartisan [way],” said Walz, who represented southern Minnesota in Congress for a dozen years before running for governor.\n\nMinnesota Gov.

In many ways, the trip resembled any year for a pheasant opener, save this time the motorcade, a dozen vehicles long, stretched out of an alley.\n\nOne patron, who declined to give her name but said she grew up in Madelia and lived in New Ulm, was buying a six-pack of beer when she told the bartender, “Is that Walz? I don’t got time for that guy.”\n\nLater, when Walz briefly emerged from a side room, a chorus of cheers greeted him from the balcony before he hustled out to the motorcade.","summary":"Gov.

Why it matters.","text":"Former President Barack Obama this week hit the campaign trail for Vice President Kamala Harris, part of a concerted effort to rally support around the Democratic presidential nominee with less than a month remaining before the election.Obama has long been known for his soaring oratory, which helped propel him to the White House in 2008. That year, Obama's diverse voting coalition was headlined by overwhelming support from Black and young voters, two groups that Harris needs to win in November.But Obama's remarks while in Pittsburgh on Thursday sparked a major debate about Black voters and their loyalty to the Democratic Party and former President Donald Trump's push to make inroads with the key group.\"You're coming up with all kinds of reasons and excuses,\" Obama said of Black male voters. \"I've got a problem with that.\"He continued: \"Part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren't feeling the idea of having a woman as president, and you're coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that.\"With Harris working to build her own voting coalition in what's expected to be a tight race, every vote will matter. Here's why Obama's remarks on Harris' presidential candidacy are so significant.In virtually every national poll, Harris boasts significant leads with female voters, buoyed by her strength on issues like reproductive rights and healthcare. Harris has recently cut into Trump's long-standing advantage on economic issues, which could be pivotal in battleground states like Arizona and North Carolina.Meanwhile, Trump continues to poll well with male voters, particularly among white men who didn't attend college.In the latest New York Times/Siena College national poll, Harris led Trump 49% to 46% among likely voters. While Harris had a 16-point lead with women, Trump had an 11-point edge with men.Obama's remarks reflected concerns among many Democrats that Black men — particularly young Black men — are gravitating toward Trump and could cost Harris the election.But some Democrats have called out the former president for his remarks, arguing that his admonishment of Black men put off by Harris' gender was misplaced.\"Why are Black men being lectured to? Why are Black men being belittled in ways that no other group [is]?\" former Ohio state senator and ex-Democratic congressional candidate Nina Turner told CNN on Thursday.Black men and Black women do not vote much differently, it’s wrong to single out Black men when Black men are the most loyal male voting block for Democrats.It’s patronizing and wrong. pic.twitter.com/2OXmq9q1TW\"Now, a lot of love for former President Obama, but for him to single out Black men is wrong,\" she continued. \"Some of the Black men that I have talked to have their reasons why they want to vote a different way, and even if some of us may not like that, we have to respect it.\"Turner and some other Democrats have noted that Black men remain among the most reliable supporters of the party.In the 2016 presidential election, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton won 94% of Black female voters, compared to 82% among Black men, according to exit polling. The results reflected the long-standing loyalty that Black voters have had with Democrats.That year, Trump won 4% of Black women votes while taking 13% of Black male votes. (Latino voters strongly backed Clinton, but both white men and white women overall supported Trump.)In 2020, now-President Joe Biden won 92% of Black voters, compared to 8% for Trump, according to the Pew Research Center.But Obama and other Democrats are hoping to get ahead of what they see as Trump's potential to win over more Black voters — and especially Black men — this time around.The newly released New York Times/Siena College poll showed that 78% of Black likely voters supported Harris, while Trump pulled in 15% support among Black likely voters.

The video, dating back to a 1993 New Year’s Eve special, shows Stern in blackface makeup with exaggerated features, repeatedly using racial slurs in a skit intended to parody actor Ted Danson’s infamous blackface performance at a roast for Whoopi Goldberg. In the clip, Stern used the N-word multiple times, igniting outrage when the video went viral on social media. Stern has since addressed the controversy, expressing regret for the sketch, which he now realizes was offensive.\n\nAs per the New York Post, in a 2020 episode of his SiriusXM show, Stern admitted, “The s–t I did was f–ing crazy, I’ll be the first to admit. I won’t go back and watch those old shows; it’s like, who is that guy? But that was my shtick, that’s what I did and I own it. I don’t think I got embraced by Nazi groups and hate groups. They seemed to think I was against them too. Everybody had a bone to pick with me.” Stern owned his past actions, but the resurfacing of the video has led to renewed outrage, with some calling for accountability.\n\nStern further shared, “The big headline is this, and this is my fear in all of this. I was able to change my approach, able to change my life and change how I communicated. If I had to do it all over again, would I lampoon Ted Danson, a White guy in blackface?... Yeah, I was lampooning him and saying, I’m going to shine a light on this. But would I go about it the same way now? Probably not. Not probably, I wouldn’t.” Despite the backlash, Harris joined Stern on his SiriusXM show recently as part of a larger media blitz ahead of the 2024 election. During the interview, Stern aligned himself with Harris in her ongoing criticisms of former President Donald Trump.\n\nAs per USA Today, Harris, who has repeatedly accused Trump of aspiring to authoritarianism, doubled down on her belief that Trump harbors a \"desire to be a dictator.\" She argued, \"I believe that Donald Trump has this desire to be a dictator. He admires strong men and he gets played by them because he thinks that they're his friends and they are manipulating him full-time and manipulating him by flattery and with favor. I grew up in the neighborhood. Some would say you're getting punked if you stand in favor of somebody who's an adversary over your friends on principles that we all agree on…\"\n\nStern, known for his sharp commentary, supported Harris’ views on the former President. As the conversation shifted to foreign policy, Harris pointed to Trump’s handling of relationships with U.S. adversaries, particularly his secretive dealings with Putin. Trump responded to the interview on Truth Social, accusing Stern of asking “softball questions” and dismissing the criticism as politically motivated. His campaign spokesperson also took a jab at Harris, claiming that her stance on Russia would embolden Putin.","summary":"In the clip, Stern used the N-word multiple times, igniting outrage when the video went viral on social media.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/howard-sterns-1993-blackface-video-has-resurfaced-ahead-of-kamala-harris-interview","image":"https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/719844/uploads/2a7ffbf0-8895-11ef-b111-ad81d2b28047_1200_630.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-12 20:45:00","author":"INQUISITR,Ishita Sen Gupta","authors":["INQUISITR","Ishita Sen Gupta"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.015},{"id":259467044,"title":"Walz tramps through tall grass on Minnesota's pheasant hunting season opener but bags no birds","text":"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Walz spent Saturday morning tramping through tall grass on the opening day of Minnesota’s pheasant hunting season, giving the campaign a chance to highlight the governor’s rural roots and love of outdoor sports.\n\nNeither Walz nor Lt.

She claims that this figure could potentially balloon to $500 million, based on statements attributed to her uncle.Meanwhile, Mary Trump doesn't mince words to describe the tech entrepreneur, referring to Musk as \"the world's richest fascist\" and a \"South African jumping bean.\" She claims that Musk's interest in supporting her uncle stems from a desire to gain influence over potential future government policies.\"In exchange for Donald's willingness to throw Musk the keys to the federal government, Musk is throwing a considerable fortune, as well as the weight of Twitter's influence, behind the Republican candidate,\" Mary Trump writes.In her blog post, she also characterizes this business arrangement as a \"devil's bargain,\" drawing parallels to Trump's alleged connections with other powerful figures, including Russian President Vladimir Putin.Mary Trump accuses the billionaire of actively working to \"keep the American electorate as ignorant as possible\" through his control of X, alleging that the Trump campaign is coordinating with Musk to suppress or remove unfavorable stories.The blog post also highlights recent activities by Musk-funded entities, including the America PAC's distribution of cash to voters in Philadelphia, which she describes as a \"maybe-legal-but-sketchy-anyway scheme to spread pro-Trump dollars around in critical swing states.\"On October 7, Musk announced a referral program through his PAC, offering a $47 bonus for each registered swing-state voter referred to an online petition. The petition requires signers to submit personal contact information.\"For every person you refer who is a swing state voter, you get $47!\" Musk wrote on X. \"Easy money.\" The $47 figure is significant as Trump would be the 47th U.S. president if elected.The petition states that signers support \"First and Second Amendment rights,\" but lacks traditional petition elements such as a recipient, delivery date, or specific demands. Upon signing, users are directed to voter registration links for seven swing states: Pennsylvania, Georgia, North Carolina, Nevada, Arizona, Michigan and Wisconsin.Musk's America PAC stated, \"The PAC's goal 'is to get 1 million registered voters in swing states to sign in support of the Constitution, especially freedom of speech and the right to bear arms.'\"Mary Trump's allegations also come amid significant developments in the relationship between Musk and the former president. Recently, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal from Musk's X platform regarding an investigation into the former president's alleged election interference.The case centered around a nondisclosure order preventing X from informing Trump about a warrant issued by Department of Justice (DOJ) special counsel Jack Smith's team.Trump faces four felony counts in the DOJ's case against him in Washington, D.C., after he allegedly tried to overturn President Joe Biden's 2020 election victory in the aftermath of his loss, which culminated in the U.S. Capitol riot on January 6, 2021. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges and claimed the case is politically motivated against him.Meanwhile, Musk has become increasingly vocal in his support for Trump as he recently appeared at a Trump campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, where he declared himself \"Dark MAGA [Make America Great Again]\" and warned that \"this will be the last election\" if Trump doesn't win in November.Newsweek contacted Trump's campaign and Musk's press contact via email on Saturday for comment.Musk's public endorsement of Trump follows a series of critical remarks by him about Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, and the current administration.On X on October 3, Musk intensified his criticism of the government and wrote, \"Unless something is done about the bureaucratic smothering of America, humanity will never reach the stars.\" He emphasized his belief that Trump getting a second term is crucial for preventing \"continued expansion of oppressive big government, making progress impossible.\"The Tesla CEO also took aim at Harris' political record on October 3 and wrote on X: \"Kamala's voting track record when she was in the Senate was to the left of Bernie Sanders! She was rated most far left of all 100 senators. Not a moderate at all.\"Mary Trump concludes her blog post with a stark warning about the potential consequences of a Trump-Musk alliance.\"Separately, Donald and Musk are both dangerous enough. Together, they are in an even stronger position to end American democracy and align this country with the world's most destructive foreign actors,\" she writes.","summary":"Mary Trump wrote that her estranged uncle has always been susceptible to financial influence and he \"has always been for sale.\"","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/mary-trump-donald-trump-elon-musk-new-owner-1968135","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2494074/donald-trump-elon-musk.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-12 20:35:53","author":"Adeola Adeosun","authors":["Adeola Adeosun"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.211},{"id":259468566,"title":"Christians flock to Washington to pray for America to turn to God — by electing Trump","text":"Tens of thousands of evangelical Christians gathered on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., on Saturday to pray for America’s atonement and for Donald Trump’s return to the White House. Organizers of the “A Million Women” event billed the gathering — and next month’s presidential election — as “a last stand moment” to save the nation from forces of darkness. For hours, the gathered masses sang worship songs, waved flags symbolizing their belief that America was founded as an explicitly Christian nation and prayed aloud for Jesus to intercede on behalf of Trump in November. “If we don’t stand now,” said Grace Lin, who traveled from Los Angeles for the rally and came wearing a red “Make America Great Again” hat, “then the enemy will take over our country. If that happens, that’s the end.” Lou Engle, the self-described prophet who organized the event, said God told him in a dream to call on a million women to march on Washington in order to restore God’s dominion over the nation. Engle is a leader in the New Apostolic Reformation, a movement of charismatic Christians who for years have portrayed U.S. politics as a spiritual clash between good and evil and Trump as a flawed leader anointed by God to redeem the nation. “Listen to the cries of your people,” Engle shouted Saturday as thousands of followers lifted their hands to the sky. “Save us God!” From a stage overlooking the Washington Monument, Engle and other speakers warned of a multitude of threats they say are facing America: crime, religious persecution, abortion and the growing acceptance of LGBTQ people. Thousands of women came wearing pink shirts emblazoned with the words “Don’t Mess With Our Kids” — the name and slogan of an anti-LGBTQ activist group that claims library books, public school teachers and pop culture are tricking children into changing genders. Susan Marsh, who drove from Maryland, said she attended because she fears if Democrats maintain power, her 10-month old grandson will grow up in a nation where he’s pressured to identify as a girl. As she sang and prayed, Marsh waved a large Appeal to Heaven flag — a prominent symbol of the Christian movement to end the separation of church and state in America. “So many people are hopeless right now,” Marsh said, choking up as she spoke to a reporter. “Our children are going through surgeries that are unnecessary because their hearts are broken and they think they’re not who they’re supposed to be.” Maryn Freitag was part of a group of about 50 people who traveled from Minnesota. She said she came “to stand with the man who God has selected as the president.” She then gestured to her hat, which spelled out “Trump 2024” in shimmering rhinestones. Freitag refused to contemplate what would happen if Trump loses to Vice President Kamala Harris: “I don’t even want to go there,” she said. Sandi Woskie, another member of the Minnesota contingent, overheard the comment. She leaned in and said: “Think armageddon.” “That’s right,” Freitag said. “If we don’t turn this nation back to the Lord, we’re on a fast slide into the abyss with no return.” Matthew Taylor, a senior scholar at the nonprofit Institute for Islamic, Christian, and Jewish Studies in Maryland, said those comments are representative of a dangerous and increasingly widespread embrace of apocalyptic political messaging on the Christian right. Taylor, who attended the march Saturday as part of his research, has spent years studying the New Apostolic Reformation and its unwavering support for Trump. He documented in his book, “The Violent Take it by Force,” how false claims about widespread election fraud by Engle and other Christian nationalist leaders helped fuel the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Taylor said he worries that the dire messaging — and the portrayal of Trump as God’s chosen candidate to defeat evil Democrats — could set the stage for more violence. “This is about activating the most ardent Christian supporters of Donald Trump, putting them into an apocalyptic mindset that says this election is do or die for America,” Taylor said. “The danger is that these folks can easily be converted over into Capitol rioters if the right circumstances come about and if their leaders give them that guidance.” Taylor — and many others in attendance — noted that the crowd was more racially and ethnically diverse than most conservative political rallies. Churches from across the country, including some majority Black denominations, chartered buses for the event. Organizers chose to hold the event on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in Judaism, because it is a day to atone for sin. LaTrece Curry, a Black mother who said she voted for former President Barack Obama in 2008, drove from Ohio with her husband and four children. She said her support for Trump — a twice-divorced billionaire who's facing a range of criminal charges related to his business practices and alleged attempts to overturn the 2020 election — has led to divisions and arguments with her Black friends and family members. But she believes he’s the only candidate who will set America back on a moral course. “I do think it is a last stand,” Curry said. “But God has given us so much time. Now judgment will come.” Phil Heilman drove with his wife from Florida. They learned about the event while attending a get-out-the-vote rally in Georgia hosted by Lance Wallnau, an evangelist who coined and popularized the Seven Mountains Mandate — a growing belief on the American right that says conservative Christians are called to occupy positions of power in seven key spheres of society, including business, education, media and government. Wallnau was among the speakers Saturday. Heilman said he gets his news from FlashPoint, a TV program that reaches hundreds of thousands of followers with a blend of pro-Trump political commentary and prophetic messages about God’s divine plans for America. He worries about what will happen if Trump loses, but he said he has faith that Satan will be defeated even if Harris and the Democrats prevail. “If that happens, it’s not going to be a political solution,” Heilman said. “God will provide other opportunities to take the country back that will be more surreptitious, or underground.” Heilman, holding a large red “Jesus Is King” flag over his shoulder, didn’t expand on what that might look like. One way or another, he said, “righteousness will prevail.”","summary":"Tens of thousands of evangelical Christians gathered on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., to pray for America’s atonement and for Donald Trump’s return to the White House.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/christians-swarm-washington-pray-america-turn-god-electing-trump-rcna175162","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-10/20241012-a-million-women-christian-march-dc-wm-1142a-91aeca.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-12 20:32:02","author":"Mike Hixenbaugh","authors":["Mike Hixenbaugh"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.001},{"id":259466370,"title":"Donald Trump Used Shocking Slur About Kamala Harris at Fundraiser: Report","text":"TCF vendors\n\nExponential Interactive, Inc d/b/a VDX.tvCookie duration: 90 (days).Data collected and processed: Probabilistic identifiers, IP addresses, Browsing and interaction data, Non-precise location data, Device identifiers, Users’ profiles, Privacy choicesmoreCookie duration resets each session.

The night he came, I had a bet with Sandy that I could make the chairman of Warner Bros. cry by 9pm, and I was completely focused on that. It was quite a big bet. She didn’t believe I could do it but I did it.”\n\nGrant added, “So, I’m afraid Donald Trump didn’t really register. All I remember is that a day or two afterwards, I got a call to say, ‘You’ve been made a member of Trump National New York.’ And like, ‘Oh, alright then’ — which was a golf club — but I don’t remember him greatly as a person.”\n\nIn Two Weeks Notice, Grant plays billionaire George Wade, whose environmentally conscious assistant Lucy Kelson (Bullock) puts in her notice after her boss becomes too dependent on her, only to realize they have feelings for each other.\n\nAfter her ABC News debate with Trump last month, Kamala Harris has accepted a CNN invite for an Oct. 23 town hall following the deadline for both candidates to agree to a presidential debate on the network. The town hall will be broadcast live from the critical swing state of Pennsylvania.\n\nAlthough Trump previously declared “THERE WILL BE NO THIRD DEBATE” for him, CNN has also proposed an individual town hall for him. He has since agreed to a pre-taped Fox News town hall focused on issues affecting women, which will air Oct. 16.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nAlthough Hugh Grant shared the screen with Donald Trump nearly 15 years&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Hugh Grant shares that he hardly noticed Donald Trump in his brief appearance in &#8216;Two Weeks Notice&#8217; first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/hugh-grant-shares-that-he-hardly-noticed-donald-trump-in-his-brief-appearance-in-two-weeks-notice/","image":"https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Sandra-Bullock-Hugh-Grant-Two-Weeks-Notice.jpg?w=300","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-12 20:19:42","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.079},{"id":259467682,"title":"What Nigeria stands to gain and lose from a Trump or Harris presidency","text":"The world is closely watching as the U.S. goes to the polls on November 5 to choose a new president during its general elections. For a nation like Nigeria, which shares close political and economic ties with the world’s largest economy, its future trade relations, investment inflows, and regulatory landscape could shift significantly depending on who takes the White House: Republican Donald Trump or Democrat Kamala Harris.\n\nAt a forum by Udo Udoma & Belo-Osagie (UUBO) partnering with Mercury Public Affairs on Thursday, policy experts and U.S.-served congressmen provided some insight into how Trump or Harris’s policies could play out in Nigeria when either are handed the presidential baton. While both candidates’ approaches will create ripples across global markets, the implications for Nigeria may vary substantially.\n\nEconomic policies and trade\n\nTrump’s protectionist agenda, characterised by tariffs and renegotiated trade agreements, raised concerns about the potential strain on U.S.–Africa trade. Between 2008 and 2018, trade between the two regions dropped from $100 billion to $41 billion.\n\nA second Trump term could exacerbate these trends, especially with the looming expiration of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) in 2025, which currently grants tariff-free access for Nigerian exports.\n\n“Trump’s ‘America First’ stance could lead to higher tariffs and more trade barriers, negatively affecting Nigeria’s exports to the U.S.,” says Ashleigh Theophanides, Chief Sustainability Officer at Deloitte.\n\nThere is confidence, however, that a Harris administration will renew and improve AGOA to promote renewable energy. Since Harris seeks to strengthen relationships with allies, emphasising multilateral agreements like AGOA could boost trade with African nations, including Nigeria.\n\nFinancial investments and aid funding\n\nUnder Biden, the U.S. development, humanitarian, and security assistance to Nigeria approached $1 billion in FY 2023. Harris, who is expected to pick up from where the president leaves off will more likely support investments in Africa, particularly in tech and digital infrastructure, experts say.\n\nHarris announced in May the formation of a new partnership to help provide internet access to 80 percent of Africa by 2030, up from roughly 40 percent now. Nigeria could potentially benefit from initiatives that encourage U.S. businesses to invest in the growing Nigerian tech and innovation ecosystem. \n\nMeanwhile, Trump’s previous administration saw a decline in U.S. foreign direct investment (FDI) in Africa, dropping from $50.4 billion in 2017 to $43.2 billion by 2019. Should Trump return, they think Nigeria could see further cuts in US investments and aid, impacting key sectors like infrastructure and healthcare. “Trump’s isolationist policies may hinder U.S. investments in Nigeria,” they said.\n\nForeign policy\n\nTrump’s foreign policy is expected to remain transactional, prioritising U.S. economic and security interests over diplomatic or democratic ideals. According to former Congressman Toby Moffett, Trump would likely favour direct, business-focused relationships with global partners, including Nigeria.\n\nHarris, on the other hand, is predicted to strengthen diplomatic ties with Nigeria, fostering cooperation on trade, security, and development. Her administration could promote collaborative efforts, enhancing Nigeria’s role in U.S. foreign policy.\n\nOil and energy\n\nNigeria has remained Africa’s largest crude oil producer, but has recently been exploring alternative energy sources such fossil fuels, Compressed natural gas (CNG) for vehicles and power generation. Experts say that while Trump’s pro-fossil fuel stance may benefit Nigeria’s oil exports, his focus on U.S. energy independence could reduce demand for Nigerian oil.\n\nHarris, with her emphasis on climate adaptation and a transition toward renewable energy, may injure the oil trade between both countries, but open a window to accelerate Nigeria’s shift away from oil dependence. Though this shift could reduce U.S. demand for Nigerian crude, it might also help stabilise global oil markets and help Nigeria break into renewable energy sectors.\n\nImmigration\n\nThere are up to 402,000 Nigerians living in the U.S. as at 2020, according to the World Migration Report. In this election, 61 percent of American voters say immigration is a priority for them according to the Pew Research Centre.\n\n“We believe that immigration should be regulated as it always has particularly on our struggling border but we don’t in scape-goating and characterising people who are trying to fight for their rights and their families and their children as animals,” says Moffett, who is confident that a Harris administration would favour liberal immigration policies and support for student and professional visas.\n\nAs president, in 2017, Trump issued a controversial order banning the admission of travellers, immigrants, and refugees from seven Muslim-majority nations, which later expanded to thirteen in 2020. As Trump’s crackdown on immigration continues, experts are concerned his presidency could tighten immigration policies, making it harder for Nigerians to move to the U.S., which could potentially impact the Nigerian diaspora’s contributions through remittances, which already saw a decline last year.","summary":"The world is closely watching as the U.S. goes to the polls on November 5 to choose a new president\n\n\nread more What Nigeria stands to gain and lose from a Trump or Harris presidency","url":"https://businessday.ng/analysis/article/what-nigeria-stands-to-gain-and-lose-from-a-trump-or-harris-presidency/","image":"https://cdn.businessday.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/trump-and-kamala-Nigeria.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-12 20:19:19","author":"Bethel Olujobi And Taofeek Oyedokun","authors":["Bethel Olujobi And Taofeek Oyedokun"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ng","sentiment":-0.002},{"id":259466450,"title":"Danni Washington on Disney Jr.'s 'Ariel' and Protecting Our Oceans","text":"The Inventory\n\nBlack News and Black Views with a Whole Lotta Attitude\n\nEntertainment\nThe Culture\n\nBeauty + Style\n\nEntertainment\nThe Culture\n\nBeauty + Style\n\nEspañolDeutschFrançais\n\nLog In / Sign Up\nSend us a Tip!Subscribe\n\nAdvertisingPrivacyJobsTerms of Use\n\nExplore our other sites\n\n© 2024 G/O Media\nWe may earn a commission from links on this page\n\nEntertainment\nThe Culture\n\nBeauty + Style\n\nDanni Washington on Disney Jr's 'Ariel'\n\nShare this Video\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\nDanni Washington on Disney Jr.'s 'Ariel' and Protecting Our Oceans\n\nDanni Washington sits down with The Root to talk about her surprising hidden talent and her role as Tanti Chantale on Disney Jr's 'Ariel'.\n\nPublished27 minutes ago\n\nWe may earn a commission from links on this page.\n\nVideo Program Guide\nMost PopularLatest VideosBlack HacksThat's So RandomSmall Town HorrorSecuring The BagWhat's Black On TVThe Root InstituteUr Fav Trak\n\nMost Popular\n\nSlide 1 of 16\n\nNow playing\n\nBlack Hack: 3 Baking Soda Hacks to Add to Your Cleaning Routine\n\nNow playing\n\nComedian Keith Robinson on His Netflix Comedy Special 'Different Strokes'\n\nNow playing\n\nThe Root's Exclusive Interview with Gov.

Whitmer’s Doritos video stunt as offensive","text":"Catholic officials in the state of Michigan, including its seven diocesan bishops, condemned Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s, D-Minn., recent viral video that many people viewed as her mocking Holy Communion. Published to feminist author and filmmaker Liz Plank’s Instagram page on Thursday, the clip depicted Whitmer wearing a Harris-Walz hat and putting a Doritos chip into Plank’s mouth as the media figure knelt down on the floor. \"It is not just distasteful or ‘strange;’ it is an all-too-familiar example of an elected official mocking religious persons and their practices,\" Michigan Catholic Conference (MCC) President and CEO Paul A. Long said in a statement representing the views of Catholic leaders in the state. MICHIGAN GOV FEEDS KNEELING FEMALE PODCAST HOST DORITOS WHILE WEARING A HARRIS-WALZ HAT Whitmer and Plank’s viral social media clip was meant to advocate for Vice President Kamala Harris’ polices ahead of the presidential election. It came from Whitmer’s appearance on Plank’s \"Chip Chat\" podcast that was published Thursday on YouTube. The caption for Plank’s video read, \"If he won’t, Gretchen Whitmer will. Chips aren’t just delicious, the CHIPS Act is a game-changer for U.S. tech and manufacturing, boosting domestic production of semiconductors to reduce reliance on foreign suppliers! Donald Trump would put that at risk.\" In its statement, the Catholic conference blasted the stunt. \"A video posted yesterday to social media platform Instagram featuring Governor Gretchen Whitmer has prompted the state’s Catholic bishops conference to express profound disappointment and offense taken at the actions in the video.\" It continued, \"In the skit, Whitmer lays a Dorito chip on the extended tongue of a woman, who as the camera pans out is shown to be kneeling in the same manner as one would when receiving Communion on the tongue. The governor then stares expressionless into the camera.\" Additionally, conservatives on social media accused the governor and media figure of mocking the Christian sacrament. Former Trump advisor Tim Murtaugh, for example, posted, \"Let’s be clear what’s happening in this video. Gov. Whitmer of Michigan is pretending to give communion to an leftist podcaster on her knees, using a Dorito as the Eucharist while wearing a Harris-Walz hat. Do they want ZERO Catholic votes for Harris?\" HARRIS CAMPAIGN DISTANCES ITSELF FROM ’60 MINUTES’ EDIT: ‘WE DO NOT CONTROL CBS'S PRODUCTION DECISIONS’ When asked for comment, a political aide for Whitmer previously told Fox News Digital, \"The governor’s social media is well known for infusing her communications with pop culture.\" \"This popular trend has been used by countless people, including Billie Eilish, Kylie Jenner, and Stephen Colbert, and the fact that people are paying attention to a video promoting President Biden’s CHIPS Act proves it’s working,\" they said. MCC President Long insisted that Whitmer’s video \"goes further than the viral online trend that inspired it, specifically imitating the posture and gestures of Catholics receiving the Holy Eucharist, in which we believe that Jesus Christ is truly present.\" He added that even if the governor denies that offending Christians was her intention, \"it has had an offensive impact.\" The MCC statement continued, noting how the video reflects a wider decline in respect for religion. \"People of this state and across the country have grown tired of and continue to express their alarm at the bar of civility and respect toward people of faith lowering by the day. Michigan is a religiously diverse state and includes thriving communities of Christian, Jewish, and Muslim believers.\" \"The time is now for those in public office, their handlers, and strategists to return a level of respect, civility, and appreciation for those who have found peace and fulfillment in life by worshiping God and serving their neighbor,\" in concluded. The governor’s office did not immediately reply to Fox News Digital’s most recent request for comment on the MCC’s statement.
