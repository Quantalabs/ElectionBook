JOHN TEICHERT: Accountability For America’s Afghanistan Catastrophe","text":"August marks the solemn four-year anniversary of the American failure in its tragic withdrawal from Afghanistan under President Joe Biden. On Aug. 15, 2021, the Afghan capital of Kabul fell into the hands of Taliban control. On Aug. 26,, thirteen military members disastrously lost their lives at Abbey Gate; and by the end of the month, the last American soldier ingloriously stepped onto a C-17 to complete the U.S. withdrawal. It was the low point in American power and prowess in my adult lifetime, providing images that have been seared into the American consciousness like the withdrawal from Vietnam had been two generations prior.\n\nThe situation in August of 2021 in Afghanistan was the biggest operational failure of the United States in decades. It provided striking images of incompetence that emboldened adversaries and embarrassed allies. It set off a chain of events that can be directly tied to Russia’s reckless invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and Hamas’s unthinkable terrorist surge into Israel in October of 2023. With American weakness on full display, adversaries around the world were enticed to fill the void.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Secretary Pete Hegseth have been unequivocal in their calls for complete accountability. Their staffs have echoed these same commitments to the American people. Several months later, Americans eagerly await results, and the anniversary offers the ideal time for the Administration to unveil its findings and to finally close this gut-wrenching chapter in American history. (RELATED: Three States To Send National Guard Troops To DC) \n\nThe voters have already held President Biden and the Vice President Kamala Harris accountable at the ballot box, with the results of the 2024 election being informed by this tragic geopolitical misstep. America’s confidence in their lackluster leadership rightfully never recovered from this self-inflicted wound.\n\nSimilarly, two senior military leaders with unique influence on the withdrawal – Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mike Milley and U.S. Central Command Commander General Frank McKenzie – have since retired. Their absence from the force is almost enough to put this operational blunder behind us.\n\nYet, there remain a slew of senior leaders with complicity in the Afghan withdrawal who were a part of the insular senior staff of U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) at the time. Accountability remains undone until the American public learns of their fate from the Trump Administration.\n\nThere are two primary elements of the Afghan withdrawal that warrant robust questioning – the strategic decision to withdraw and the operational decision about how to withdrawal. From my position in Iraq as our nation’s Senior Defense Official during that time, it was clear that U.S. Central Command ruled both decisions with an iron fist, with little room for discussion, dissent, or even boots-on-the-ground perspective from those stationed in Afghanistan or elsewhere in the region. And while the buck stops with the President, the strategic recommendations and operational planning from U.S. CENTCOM were pivotal in the final determination for the withdrawal and its details.\n\nU.S. CENTCOM includes a robust staff, with general officers responsible for operations, strategy, planning, policy, and security cooperation functions. They are charged with providing the best military advice to the President and the Secretary of Defense and are considered the unquestioned strategic and operational experts in their area of responsibility. In their role in this situation, these high-ranking officers stunningly and irredeemably failed their predecessors, the military community, and the American people. They also tragically sent a shameful signal to those who had sacrificed, bled, and died in Afghanistan that their service was in vain.\n\nThe U.S. population would be horrified to know that key leaders from U.S. CENTCOM from that time have been promoted and are serving in positions with even greater authority today. This is in spite of their substandard performance during the Afghanistan withdrawal that indicated that they had already been promoted beyond their maximum levels of competence and discernment. And unlike Biden, Harris, Milley and McKenzie, their continued service flies in the face of President Trump’s clear direction to remove them from our force. Until that happens, the anniversary of the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan brings further shame to all of us while allowing the same military leaders to run a national security establishment that needs them immediately removed for our nation’s well-being!\n\nUnited States Air Force Brig.

Comey asked.\n\n'Living her best life, producing great music and as she urged all of us to do during the podcast, not giving the jerks power over her mind,' Comey said, referring to the pop icon's recent appearance on the 'New Heights' podcast hosted by her NFL star boyfriend Travis Kelce and his brother Jason Kelce. \n\nTrump's most recent attack on Swift came earlier this month when he pitted the pop star against actress Sydney Sweeney, claiming that Swift was 'No Longer Hot' after she endorsed his 2024 Presidential rival Kamala Harris last year. \n\n'She said something about dealing with internet trolls that stuck with me - think of your energy as if it's expensive,' Comey added in his Sunday video.\n\nComey is currently under investigation for implying President Donald Trump 'should be assassinated.'\n\nHe uploaded a cryptic picture on his Instagram account back in May which featured an assortment of shells arranged to spell out: '86 47.'\n\nThat specific combination of numbers has been linked to the assassination of Trump and a 'quiet resistance.'\n\nThe number 86 is considered slang for 'to kill or murder' within some circles, in an apparent reference to a standard sized grave being eight feet long and six feet deep.\n\nTrump is the 47th president, so some anti-Trump groups use the two numbers together to indicate that Trump should be assassinated.\n\nThe former FBI Director's daughter, Maureen Comey, was fired from her post as a prosecutor in the Manhattan US attorney's office last month, a move that was announced by Trump's Attorney General Pam Bondi. \n\nThe former FBI chief channeled Swift in his Sunday video, after the singer noted during her appearance on the New Heights podcast last week to 'think of your energy as if it's expensive, as if it's a luxury item.'\n\n'Not everyone can afford it. Not everyone has invested in you in order to be able for you have the capital to care about this,' the 'Bad-Blood' singer added.\n\nBrittney Mahomes, wife of Kelce's Kansas City Chiefs teammate Patrick Mahomes, was one celebrity who reposted the clip of Swift's advice on Friday morning and wrote, with three applauding emojis: 'That. Is. The. Day.'\n\nThe star WAG duo's at times rocky friendship appears stronger than ever after the singer's podcast appearance.\n\nThis time last year, the brand new besties appeared to suddenly be at odds after Mahomes endorsed Donald Trump in the upcoming election while Swift, who has a long-running feud with Trump, backed Harris.\n\nSwift also announced her new album on the podcast, with her 12th record 'The Life of a Showgirl' to be released October 3.\n\nThree-time Super Bowl winner Patrick revealed Wednesday he had an early heads-up that Swift was finally appearing on the show, telling reporters at practice: I knew before y'all did just because they called me after the podcast was done.'\n\nHe jokingly corrected himself, adding: 'They didn't call me, they called Brittany. I was in the back of the FaceTime.'\n\nSoon enough, Mahomes and Swift will be reunited at Arrowhead Stadium once the Kansas City Chiefs start the new NFL season.","summary":"Former FBI Director James Comey has tried his best to stay culturally relevant, chiming in Sunday with his take on some viral advice from a pop-culture icon.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15008841/Democrat-ex-FBI-director-admits-learned-unlikely-wisdom-popstar-deal-Trump.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/08/17/22/101304463-0-image-m-28_1755464438164.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-17 21:19:11","author":"Editor,Victoria Churchill","authors":["Editor","Victoria Churchill"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.091},{"id":351929260,"title":"How Taylor Swift’s star power keeps growing despite Trump’s bad blood","text":"Taylor Swift has been on the road—and the political stage—longer than many presidential candidates. Her 21-month-long “Eras Tour” took to 21 counties and over 50 cities, drawing stadiums full of die-hard fans. Earlier this year, she reminded everyone of her reach with a brief but buzzy appearance on the Super Bowl jumbotron.\n\nNot everyone’s impressed, though. President Donald Trump has emerged as one of her most vocal critics, declaring in both May and August that Swift is “no longer hot.” His grudge isn’t random—Swift famously endorsed Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris in 2024, directly opposing Trump.\n\nTrue to form, he seems unable—or unwilling—to shake it off.\n\nBut Trump’s jabs don’t seem to be hurting her. A new Navigator Research poll, conducted Aug. 7-11, finds that 50% of registered voters view Swift favorably, while 36% view her unfavorably.\n\n“Donald Trump’s Truth Social attacks on Taylor Swift aren’t working, and the data proves it,” said Erica Seifert, senior director of Navigator Research. “As we have known all too well, the majority of Americans view her favorably. It’s not a fearless move to go after Swift; it’s another attempt by a failed leader to take attention away from his big, bad reputation.”\n\nHer politics have deepened partisan fault lines, though. Among Democrats, her net favorability is +49 points, and among independents, it’s +8 points. Among Republicans, however, she’s now at -22 points—a sharp drop from August 2023, when she was at +15 points. That decline accelerated after her Harris endorsement, especially among voters without a college degree.\n\nThe pessimistic view among Republicans isn’t surprising given Trump’s ongoing attacks. Last September, he blasted out an all-caps Truth Social post declaring his hatred for Swift, a message that set the tone for conservative media coverage and GOP voter sentiment.\n\nThis shift matches other polling. An NBC News survey conducted in September 2024, just days after Swift publicly endorsed Harris, found that about 47% of Republicans viewed her negatively—a sharp rise from 26% in November 2023. Positive views among Republicans fell from 28% to just 12% over the same period. Meanwhile, her favorability among Democrats increased from 53% to 58%.\n\nIt’s worth noting that not everyone was paying attention. A YouGov poll conducted before Swift’s endorsement in August 2024 found that just over two-thirds of Americans (68%) were indifferent to her political nod, while only 8% said it would make them more likely to endorse her preferred candidate.\n\nSwift’s popularity goes beyond politics, though. In the past week, she revealed the title of her upcoming album, “The Life of a Showgirl,” as well as more details about the album on an enormously popular football podcast hosted by her boyfriend, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce.\n\nAs Swift prepares for a new era, her political and cultural influence shows no signs of waning. Whether on stage or in the political arena, she remains a powerful force capable of shaping public discourse—and, for better or worse, drawing the ire of the most powerful person in the country.","summary":"Taylor Swift has been on the road—and the political stage—longer than many presidential candidates.

West Virginia Governor Patrick Morrisey confirmed that 300–400 National Guard troops would be dispatched to the nation’s capital. South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster announced the deployment of 200 troops, while Ohio Governor Mike DeWine confirmed 150 military police officers would join the operation. These deployments add to the roughly 800 troops already stationed in the city. Trump declared a “public safety emergency” on Monday, saying Washington was suffering from “complete and total lawlessness” and was plagued by “violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals.” Data Contradicts Trump’s Portrayal Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) statistics, however, contradict Trump’s claims. Homicides in Washington dropped by 32% between 2023 and 2024, reaching their lowest level since 2019. Preliminary figures show violent crime overall has declined by 26% so far in 2025 compared to the same period last year, while robberies have fallen 28%, according to MPD data cited by BBC Verify. Mayor Muriel Bowser rejected Trump’s assertions, noting that while crime spiked in 2023, it has since stabilised and fallen significantly. “The data speaks for itself,” she said. Residents Push Back The deployment has sparked anger among residents, with hundreds marching through the streets over the weekend to protest Trump’s policies. Demonstrators gathered in Dupont Circle before moving through the city, chanting “Free DC!” while others beat drums and rang bells. Many residents, 92% of whom voted for Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election, have voiced frustration with the heavy federal presence. Social media videos show residents filming National Guard patrols and questioning the need for a military build-up. Legal and Political Dispute The Trump administration previously attempted to assume command of the city’s police force under the District of Columbia Home Rule Act but backed down after legal challenges. However, Judge Ana Reyes later ruled that Mayor Bowser must comply with White House directives. Critics argue that Trump’s depiction of Washington is politically motivated. “This is about optics, not reality,” one DC resident said at Saturday’s march. Meanwhile, federal officials maintain that the troop deployments are necessary to ensure public safety.

And according to its now-former fact-checker, that missing captain is its billionaire owner, Jeff Bezos. \"He has to be committed to it. If he's not committed to it, he should find someone else to own it,\" Glenn Kessler told Fox News Digital. \"I feel like he was kind of committed to it. And then he's kind of an absentee owner, and he shouldn't be because it's, you know, one of the prime assets of American journalism.\" Kessler left the Post in July after more than 27 years at the paper — and his final years there were not the best. \"What's so saddening is that five years ago, I would not have imagined The Washington Post would be in this state,\" Kessler said. WASHINGTON POST'S EFFORTS TO COURT CONSERVATIVES COULD DRIVE AWAY ITS LIBERAL READERS, EX-FACT CHECKER WARNS Kessler never considered leaving the Post until he was presented with the buyout offer, which he accepted. The Post has been financially bleeding, so much so that it reportedly was on pace to lose at least $77 million in 2024. The buyouts had targeted the most veteran staffers, aiming to cut costs and ward off layoffs for the time being. The famed fact-checker was among several high-profile journalists and columnists who have left the paper in recent months, many of whom took issue with decisions and editorial changes Bezos himself had ordered. Kessler compared the Post to \"being on the Titanic after it struck an iceberg — drifting aimlessly as it sank, with not enough lifeboats for everyone\" in a piece he wrote on his newly-launched Substack account. \"They have to have a vision of where they want to go. And I've not seen that vision yet. Or if there is a vision, it's not been clearly articulated,\" Kessler said. \"It's gonna be a really rocky period in the news business in the next five to ten years. And the Post needs to be prepared for that. And I kind of feel like they've lost a lot of, you know, important sailors and captains to keep the ship going. So they're gonna have to make do with less.\" Before hitting the iceberg Bezos has been the target of intense blowback by liberals, who've accused him of bending the knee to President Donald Trump based on actions that have rocked the paper. First was his decision in October to halt the planned endorsement of then-Vice President Kamala Harris just days before the presidential election. Then, in February, he launched a new mission for the editorial pages to promote \"personal liberties and free markets,\" vowing to not publish any pieces that go against those principles. Both instances sparked rebellion among the paper's liberal readers, leading to the cancellation of hundreds of thousands of subscriptions. Several staffers also resigned in protest. But Kessler wasn't always a Bezos critic. He credited the Amazon founder for saving the Post when he bought it in 2013. \"Before Bezos bought the newspaper, it was in really bad shape,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"People forget how, you know, because the Graham family didn't really have the resources to keep it going in the new era. And there had been a bunch of buyouts and people were asked to leave. So it had been a pretty grim period then.\" WASHINGTON POST BOMBARDED WITH ‘CAKE’ PARTIES FOR DEPARTING STAFFERS Things at the Post were souring so much so that Kessler himself had been interviewing for a different job outside the paper. That was until he was offered The Fact Checker stint in 2011, which he accepted, thinking that if the ship went down, he himself could stay afloat with his own \"brand.\" \"But then Bezos bought the paper, and he invested a lot of money in the paper,\" Kessler said. \"So the size of the staff doubled. The number of foreign bureaus probably went up [by] at least a third. The resources devoted to engineering support surged, so the web pages started loading faster, and we could do fantastic graphics. There was investment in video… And you really felt like the Post was going places, and it was actually producing better journalism at any point in the time I had worked at the Post.\" \"And now it is just… it's like it hit an iceberg, and it's kind of drifting there, and I don't think there's a plan to rescue it. Or at least a plan to, you know, turn the ship around and get it moving in the direction it was.\" ‘The Avis Problem’ Kessler blamed management for being \"a little dazzled\" by the traffic spike that came during the first Trump administration, reaching levels \"almost equal\" to the Post's top rival, The New York Times. But then, unlike the Times, the Post failed to capitalize on its new readers by not expanding its portfolio. \"I've sat in many meetings and had many discussions and heard lots of speeches. I still have no idea what they're trying to do,\" Kessler said of his former bosses. \"It vaguely seems to say we're gonna appeal [to] the people… who don't really care about the news. And we're gonna provide products that would allow them to read The Washington Post and find out information they need to know,\" he said. \"And the problem, as I wrote in my piece, is that that's what The New York Times has been doing for ten years. They have 10 million subscribers, but a large chunk of that are people that don't get the core news product,\" Kessler continued. \"They get the recipes, they get The Athletic — the sports section, they get product recommendations, they get the games, they play Wordle.\" WASHINGTON POST REELING FROM BUYOUT EXODUS AS BOSSES HOPE TO TURN THE PAGE AT EMBATTLED PAPER He said the Post is stuck with \"the Avis problem,\" citing the car rental company's old ads that claimed \"We try harder,\" alluding to the reality it was always in the shadow of Hertz, a dynamic similar to the Gray Lady. \"The Washington Post has always been No. 2. It's never had the same size circulation as the Times. I would argue news coverage was better, but maybe I was biased about that,\" Kessler conceded to Fox News Digital. \"But now in this fragmented marketplace, people have to make a choice. What Substacks am I going to subscribe to? What newsletters am I gonna get? What networks am I going to watch? ‘Oh, I need one newspaper. I'll be willing to spend money on one newspaper,' and the default is always going to be, unfortunately, The New York Times.\" He continued, \"It's a broader product. It has better arts coverage, theater coverage. I've never gotten an understanding of how the Post was going to combat that problem. And it sounded like the solution was, 'Oh, we're going to be like a mini-me New York Times with things to appeal to people that don't follow news.' Well, they already get that in The New York Times.\" The Post has scrapped an initiative launched last year dubbed \"WP Ventures,\" meant to attract social media users. However, the paper appears to already be pivoting with Tuesday's announcement of former Axios executive editor and former Post reporter, Sara Kehaulani Goo, returning as its president of Creator Network — a new position Goo says will be \"creating personality-driven content\" and help provide advertisers \"access\" to a new audience driven by creators. The ‘meteorite’ wiping off the remaining dinosaurs The Times and the rise of new media weren't the only obstacles facing the Post. \"Midway through my journalism career, I started saying, 'I'm working for a dinosaur.' And AI is quite possibly the meteorite that will kill off the last of the dinosaurs,\" Kessler said to Fox News Digital. \"I'm greatly concerned about what AI is gonna do, because AI is gonna kill search. And search was how people often found our news articles.\" \"The statistics I had seen was that four or five years ago, every 100 searches on Google yielded six clicks on a news site. Now it's about every 100 searches yields two clicks on the news site. When people use AI, a thousand searches result in one click,\" he continued. \"So it's a dramatic difference. And if I were running a news organization, at this point, I don't know quite what I would do about that. So it's a bad time to be running a new organization. I do have sympathy for the situation that [Washington Post publisher and CEO] Will Lewis and [Washington Post executive editor] Matt Murray find themselves in right now. I just question whether or not they really have figured out what to do.\" Goo said in her announcement that \"we're going to be infusing AI with everything that we do to help us maximize efficiency and scale.\" But the buck ultimately stops with Bezos, according to Kessler. \"The Post was really at its high point [after Bezos' purchase]— the amount of stories we're producing, the quality of the stories was really significant. And then, traffic surged when Trump got elected and there was so much hunger and interest in the news we were producing. We kind of lost our way after that,\" Kessler said. \"And not only lost our way, we started losing oodles of money. A hundred million dollars one year, I think the last number I saw [in] 2023 was $77 million… I think even for a person as rich as Jeff Bezos, that counts as real money.\" \"And I have gotten the sense that he's a bit of an absentee owner. He's had other distractions, and he's committed more to some of his other enterprises, such as a space company, than he is to The Washington Post, which is really just a tiny part of his business investments. And maybe, I don't know, I hate to speculate, maybe you thought he gave us his best shot, and we blew it, and now we've got it muddled through,\" he added. A spokesperson for The Washington Post told Fox News Digital, \"The Washington Post is reinventing itself to be a trusted news source for all Americans. That means working hard each day to publish the most accurate news, alongside opinions that resonate across the nation.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP","summary":"In an interview with Fox News Digital, former Washington Post fact checker Glenn Kessler called out Jeff Bezos and the paper&apos;s top management as he says the news outlet &quot;lost its way.&quot;","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/ex-washington-post-fact-checker-hits-absentee-owner-bezos-tells-him-commit-saving-paper-sell","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/10/bezos-washington-post.png","video":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6376935375112","publish_date":"2025-08-17 20:00:19","author":"Joseph Wulfsohn","authors":["Joseph Wulfsohn"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.282},{"id":351927664,"title":"Three Republican-led states to send National Guard troops to DC","text":"Agents from several federal law enforcement agencies have spent the week patrolling Washington's most populous and touristed areas alongside the National Guard troops.\n\nMany in Washington DC, where 92% of residents voted for Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election, have expressed frustration with Trump's enforcement policy.\n\nResidents have taken to filming federal officers as they patrol and over the weekend, the frustration expanded into peaceful protests against the administration.\n\nMarchers congregated in Dupont Circle, a central hub in the city, and marched through the streets chanting \"Free DC!\" Some banged drums and rang bells as they marched.\n\nResidents in Washington, DC have expressed concerns about crime in surveys, and a former employee of the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) was attacked and beaten in the city recently.\n\nTrump has painted a portrait of the nation's capital as beset by \"violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals.\"\n\nBut Mayor Muriel Bowser has rejected Trump's claims about rampant crime in the city.

Fateh is touting his DSA credentials while also claiming he does not support the DSA position of abolishing the police (the same rhetorical walk back that Zohran Mamdani is going through in New York City).\n\nThat ballot measure failed in 2021 by a vote of 56%-44%. It is entirely possible that Fateh’s candidacy fails as well if voter sentiment is not where the Minnesota DFL is. But there is no denying that the Minnesota Democratic apparatus is backing the socialist, including the state party, five of the 13 city council members (including the council’s president and vice president), and several of Fateh’s colleagues in the state legislature. Even if voters don’t end up going in that direction, Minnesota and Minneapolis Democrats have made it clear that they are all in favor of a new socialist direction.\n\nThis story didn’t start with Jacob Frey, nor does it end with Omar Fateh. Robin Wonsley sits on the city council as an independent socialist, and multiple DFL members of the council have DSA ties. That includes Aisha Chugtai, who previously served as Rep. Ilhan Omar’s campaign manager.\n\nOmar is another key part of this Minneapolis socialist craze. She took office in 2019, and her congressional district includes parts of Minneapolis. She has become a close ally of the most prominent socialists in Congress, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY). Sanders even campaigned for Omar in her primary race last year against a former Minneapolis City Councilman who nearly defeated her in 2022. With Sanders’s help, Omar cruised to a double-digit victory.\n\nOmar was the driving force behind the “defund the police” movement, and she supported eliminating the Minneapolis Police Department in the 2021 ballot measure. Omar represents every grotesque aspect of Minneapolis’s rising socialism, from the anti-police sentiment to the rampant antisemitism (which Fateh is also guilty of) to, of course, the actual socialist policies. In 2021, Omar pushed a bill that would funnel federal taxpayer dollars to localities to experiment with “universal basic income,” and then transition the country to a universal basic income program over the following decade.\n\nOmar is not just some backbench congresswoman, either. Since her election in 2018, Omar has become a quasi-celebrity, a member of a group of lawmakers given the silly nickname of “the Squad” by liberal media. Omar appeared on the cover of Time Magazine, Rolling Stone, and New York Magazine, the former two before she was even sworn into Congress, and the latter two featuring her alongside then Democratic House leader Nancy Pelosi. Omar was being propped up by Democrats as a key piece in the future of the party, and Democrats have repeatedly rallied around her to whitewash her antisemitic comments.\n\nFeaturing Omar and her like-minded socialist antisemites has already had an electoral effect on the Democratic Party. In 2024, Kamala Harris needed to select a strong running mate for her expedited presidential campaign. The obvious choice to everyone was Josh Shapiro, the popular governor of Pennsylvania, the largest swing state in the country. Shapiro was an electoral asset in Pennsylvania and in other swing states, a progressive who could convincingly portray himself as a moderate even as he dragged nuns to court to force them to pay for birth control.\n\nShapiro’s big problem was that he was Jewish, which made him unacceptable to the antisemitic socialists taking over the party, regardless of his views on Israel and Gaza. So Harris pivoted to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, to the cheers of the Democratic Socialists of America. According to the DSA, “Harris choosing Walz as a running mate has shown the world that DSA and our allies on the left are a force that cannot be ignored.”\n\nHere is what Walz thinks of antisemitic socialist Ilhan Omar: “When I’m having a tough day or I’m out on about mile five of my run and I’m feeling kind of down, and the world is pressing on me, I think ‘Ilhan Omar is a congresswoman.’ And it just brightens you up.” Walz, meanwhile, was Omar’s top pick to be Harris’s running mate.\n\nWalz was a disaster, getting mopped up in the vice presidential debate by JD Vance and serving as Harris’s leader in male outreach for a campaign that alienated male voters. It isn’t even clear that the Harris campaign vetted him. Walz was a terrible pick, and Shapiro was the obviously correct one. It would be hard to argue with the Democratic Socialists of America, then, that they are the “force” that the Democratic Party can’t ignore.\n\nThe rise of socialism in Minneapolis can be thanked for that. Minneapolis has laid the groundwork for the rise of socialism in New York City and throughout the rest of the Democratic Party. Minneapolis has dictated the direction of the national Democratic Party, and the consequences will be felt outside the Twin Cities for years to come.","summary":"Minneapolis reshaped the country for the worse in the aftermath of the death of George Floyd and the birth of the “defund the police” movement.

Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom called for mid-decade redistricting in the state after it was reported that Texas would redraw its House lines with the intention of flipping five House seats from blue to red.\n\nIf enacted, the map would likely result in a California House delegation of 48 Democrats and only four Republicans—meaning the GOP would only control 8% of seats. Meanwhile, Texas’ new proposed map would likely result in a House delegation of 30 Republicans and eight Democrats — with Democrats likely controlling 21% of seats—still a higher percentage than the 17% of current California House seats held by Republicans.\n\n“We anticipate that these maps will completely neuter and neutralize what is happening in Texas,” Newsom told reporters Thursday after announcing a November special election for Californians to vote on the gerrymandered map. California unlike Texas requires a ballot initiative to pass its proposed mid-decade map.\n\nThe Republican incumbents the proposed California map targets are California Reps. Doug LaMalfa, Ken Calvert, Darrell Issa, Kevin Kiley and David Valadao.\n\nLaMalfa and Calvert’s districts have both been in Republican hands for decades. The gerrymandered map seeks to replace both of their seats with safely Democratic ones.\n\nLaMalfa has since 2013 represented California’s 1st congressional district, which currently covers a sprawling rural area stretching from the state’s Oregon and Nevada state lines to just north of Sacramento. The seat has been held by Republicans since 1981 and LaMalfa won the 2024 election by a landslide margin of 30 percentage points.\n\nIn California Democrats’ newly proposed map, the 1st district would be reconfigured to stretch into Sonoma County’s wine country. Failed Democratic nominee Kamala Harris won the deep blue county with over 70% of the vote in 2024.\n\nCalvert, who was first elected to Congress in 1993, represents the 41st district in Southern California, stretching from Palm Springs to Corona. Calvert won reelection in 2024 by 3.4 points in a previously safe Republican district that was redrawn to be competitive following the 2020 census.However, under the new map, Calvert’s current seat would be eliminated and replaced with a heavily Democratic district just east of Los Angeles.\n\n“I strongly oppose the scheme being orchestrated behind closed doors by Sacramento politicians to take constitutionally afforded power away from the Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission and replace it with a process that would allow legislators to draw district maps that are gerrymandered to benefit themselves and their political allies,” Calvert told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “A partisan political gerrymander is not what the voters of California want as they clearly stated when they passed the VOTERS FIRST Act and participated in the Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission process.”\n\nIssa, who was elected to Congress in 2001, represents the 48th district that reaches from California’s southern border to just east of San Clemente. While Issa easily won his 2024 reelection bid by 18.6 points, the new map would shift his district from being strongly Republican to being Democratic leaning.\n\nKiley, who is in his second term representing California’s 3rd district spanning from the Sacramento suburbs to the California-Nevada border, defeated former Newsom appointee Jessica Morse in 2024 by 11 points. The Democrats’ new map seeks to add more Democratic areas by the state capital to Kiley’s district, effectively putting reelection out of reach for the incumbent.\n\nKiley is also spearheading a bill to ban mid-decade redistricting nationwide and has called for California to preserve its Citizens Redistricting Commission.\n\n“It was the voters themselves that said, ‘We want to take the politics and the politicians out of redistricting and have this done by an independent citizens commission,’ and the voters stand by that judgment,” Kiley said during a Thursday night appearance on MSNBC. “Democrats, Republicans, Independents all overwhelmingly favor keeping the Independent Commission because they know that when politicians are in charge of drawing district lines, that’s an inherent conflict of interests, because they’re then going to go and run in those districts.”\n\nThe Central Valley-based 22nd district represented by Valadao will be redrawn to be slightly more Democratic under the new map. Valadao’s current seat, which voted for former President Joe Biden by double digits, notably swung nearly 20 points to the right in the 2024 presidential election.Furthermore, California Democrats’ new proposed map also seeks to add more Democratic voters to the seats represented by California’s half dozen vulnerable Democratic incumbents, Reps. Adam Gray, Josh Harder, Mike Levin, Dave Min, Derek Tran and George Whitesides.\n\nThe nine members of the California Republican House Delegation released a joint statement Thursday on a recent poll revealing Californians greatly disapprove of the motion to override the independent redistricting commission.\n\n“Governor Newsom is trying to grab power away from the citizens on the commission and give it to Sacramento politicians to gerrymander their own districts,” the legislators wrote in the statement. “Our delegation will stand with the citizens of California and defend their rights as they stand today in our state constitution by opposing Newsom’s ballot measure. All Californians, regardless of their political affiliation, should vote NO on this attempt to eliminate the Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission’s ability to draw fair congressional districts.”\n\nOriginally published by The Daily Caller News Foundation.","summary":"THE DAILY CALLER NEWS FOUNDATION—California Democrats released a new gerrymandered House map on Friday night that, if implemented, would carve up deep red areas of...

It is part of an investigation into council members’ residency requirements.\n\nThe alleged ballot box stuffing incident took place just before the city's latest primary election on August 5 - which Musa won with more than 1,129 votes. \n\nThe video comes days after two of Musa's councilmen colleagues, Muhtasin Sadman and Mohammed Hassan, were charged over forging ballots in the city's tightly fought 2023 election.\n\nMusa was previously named as 'under investigation' in the same conspiracy - but was not charged at the time.\n\nAccording to a document by Attorney General Dana Nessel requesting a special prosecutor in the 2023 case, Musa's colleagues 'conspired to receive unvoted absentee ballots that had been signed by recently naturalized citizens.' \n\nThe accused then allegedly proceeded to 'fill in the candidates of their choosing' during the city's 2023 elections, according to the document issued in April. \n\nMusa received the most votes in the August 5 primary election, per unofficial election results released on August 6 - receiving 12.5 percent of total votes in a field of 12 candidates.\n\nOf the total 1,129 votes received by Musa, 843 were cast by absentee ballot. The 286 total of election day votes received by Musa is only the fifth-highest tally. \n\nHamtramck's council was embroiled in the election forgery scandal earlier this year - and Sadman and Hassan were charged on August 11. Musa and another council member, Mohammed Alsomiri, were not charged at the time. \n\nThe drama was ramped up when Attorney General Nessel then decided to recuse herself from the investigation because of criticism she had faced in the past.\n\nNessel, a Jewish lesbian, previously criticized policy positions taken by the Muslim-majority council to ban Pride flags from being flown on city-owned property. \n\nThe Michigan Attorney General had also faced harsh scrutiny for her prosecutions of pro-Palestinian protestors at the University of Michigan in the wake of October 7.\n\nNessel was additionally accused of prosecuting the campus protestors due to 'bias against Muslims and/or people of Arab descent.' \n\nShe foresaw similar criticisms coming her way in this ballot forgery case, as five of the defendants 'are of Arab descent' - therefore she removed herself. \n\nHamtamack, a city in Metro Detroit, has a population just over 28,000 residents, which is over 70 percent Muslim. The city became the first in America to be governed by an all-Muslim council in 2022. \n\nDetroit's Local 4 News reported that the initial investigation began 'after the city clerk noticed unusual patterns with absentee ballots - including identical handwriting on multiple envelopes and large bundles of ballots submitted at once.'\n\nHamtramck City Clerk Rana Faraj told Votebeat that 'state laws are clear that your ballot should only be handled by you or a family member,' adding that 'everyone’s cousins around here.'\n\nThe council is made up of six members, and three slots are up for election every two years. Members serve four-year terms. \n\nDonald Trump won Michigan's 15 electoral votes in 2024 with 49.7 percent of the votes to Kamala Harris' 48.3 percent.\n\nHamtramck's Mayor Amer Ghalib made waves last year after endorsing Trump for President as the mayor of America's first Muslim-majority city.\n\nTrump later nominated Ghalib to be the Ambassador to the State of Kuwait.\n\nDaily Mail have contacted Musa for comment.","summary":"Abu Musa, city councilmember of Hamtramck, Michigan, was seen in the passenger seat of a car, watching another man deposit three stacks of ballots into a drop box.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15008401/abu-musa-michigan-detroit-video-ballot-box-trump.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/08/17/17/101300505-0-image-m-50_1755449547628.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-17 17:31:27","author":"Editor,Victoria Churchill","authors":["Editor","Victoria Churchill"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.3},{"id":351904382,"title":"Arnold Schwarzenegger Is Ready To Take On Gavin Newsom","text":"For months now, Trump’s team has been lobbying GOP lawmakers and governors to redraw state maps to ensure a Republican House majority in the 2026 midterm elections. In Indiana, for example, Trump asked Gov. Mike Braun to call for a special legislative session to redistrict the Hoosier state, even sending Vice President JD Vance to implore leaders to convene.\nBraun—who Trump relegated to the kids’ table during his star-studded inauguration—has yet to make a decision on the matter, but his counterpart in Texas, Greg Abbott, is all in on the plan, with a special redistricting session planned for this week that could net the GOP five more House seats.\nIn response, Newsom announced his own redistricting proposal Thursday, saying via X that he will call a special election “to redraw our Congressional maps and defend fair representation.” At a press conference on Thursday to promote the November 4 vote, Newsom explained that redrawing California’s electoral map would generate five Democratic house seats, effectively negating any Texas gains. It’s a move that the state must make “in reaction to a president of the United States that called a sitting governor of the state of Texas and said ‘find me five seats,’” Newsom said.\n“I know they say don’t mess with Texas. Well, don’t mess with the great Golden State,” Newsom said, even as Trump appeared to do just that: Armed and masked ICE agents assembled just outside Newsom’s press event to promote the redistricting effort, a show of force that LA Mayor Karen Bass described as “completely unacceptable” and Newsom pointed to as proof that California’s redistricting is the only way forward. The ICE agents’ presence was “pretty sick and pathetic,” Newsom told reporters, describing it as everything one needs to know “about Donald Trump’s America.”\nThat scene must have sent chills down the spine of Newsom’s fellow Californian, Arnold Schwarzenegger. The Terminator star, who had Newsom’s current job from November 17, 2003, to January 3, 2011, was born shortly after World War II to a member of the Nazi party—a group that, under Trump, has experienced a significant revival. “My father was, and so many other millions of men were, sucked into a hate system through lies and deceit. And so, we have seen where that leads,” Schwarzenegger said in a 2023 interview.\nThe former governor was so disgusted by Trump that he endorsed Kamala Harris for president in 2024, saying the convicted felon “will divide, he will insult, he will find new ways to be more un-American than he already has been, and we, the people, will get nothing but more anger.”\nBut in a somewhat cryptic Instagram post on Friday, Schwarzenegger suggested his willingness to oppose Trump only goes so far. In a photo taken at a gym, the former governor is seated at what appears to be an iso-lateral front lat pulldown machine, wearing a t-shirt that reads “F*** the politicians. Terminate gerrymandering.” Schwarzenegger’s chief of staff Daniel Ketchell tells Vanity Fair that the post was intended to communicate his distaste for any effort to redistrict, regardless of motive.\n“Governor Schwarzenegger has a 20 year history of battling gerrymandering, taking power from the politicians and returning it to the people where it belongs, and he believes gerrymandering is evil no matter who does it,” Ketchell said via email.\n“He still stands by the rule we learn in pre-school: two wrongs don’t make a right … He will continue to be on the side of the people and not politicians—from either party—on this issue.”\nIt’s a stance that Newsom’s camp finds deeply disappointing. “We agree with the former governor on the urgent need for national independent redistricting,” Courtni Pugh, an advisor to the California redistricting campaign, tells Vanity Fair via written statement. “But [we] fundamentally disagree on this moment of crisis.”\n“Trump and his Texas cronies are trying to rig the 2026 election before a single person has voted,” Pugh continued. “This is a five alarm fire for our democracy.”\nIt’s unclear how hard Schwarzenegger will fight Newsom, or what form that opposition will take. Speaking with the New York Times, Schwarzenegger says that he won’t be aligning himself with the GOP as he moves forward against the current governor’s plan. “He was kind enough to let me know what he’s up to and how he feels,” the FUBAR star says of Newsom. “I told him: ‘I totally get it. I understand it.’ I said, ‘There’s no effect on our relationship.’”\nBut on this one issue, Schwarzenegger says, he must stand up to both his party and his state’s leader. “I hate the idea of the Republicans redrawing the district lines in Texas, as much as I hate what the Californians are trying to do,” he says. “But I’m thinking now about California, and about the people of California. I promised them that we are going to create a commission that would be independent of the politicians, and there will be an independent citizens’ commission drawing the lines. So I’m not going to go back on my promise. I’m going to fight for my promise.”","summary":"The Terminator star prepares to battle his gubernatorial successor over California's redistricting

the opportunity to vote for or against him?\n\nWho coordinated four local, state and federal prosecutors to destroy a former and future president by charging him with fantasy crimes that were never

down to join a New York prosecutor’s efforts to destroy an ex-president, and who met in the White House with a Georgia county prosecutor seeking to destroy an ex-president — all on the same day — a mere 72 hours after Trump announced his 2024 reelection bid?\n\nWho but the current Democrats ever impeached a president twice?\n\nHas any party ever tried an ex-president in the Senate when he was

all with de facto legal impunity?\n\nHow do the purported destroyers of democracy find themselves winning 60% to 70% approval on most of the key issues of our times, while the supposed saviors of

federal political power.\n\nTwo, the Democratic Party is polling at record lows and yet remains hellbent on alienating the traditional sources of its power — minorities, youth and Independents.\n\nThree, Democrats cannot find any issues that the people support, nor any leaders to convince the people to embrace them.\n\nSo it is no surprise that the panicked Democrats bark at the shadows — given that they know their revolutionary, neo-socialist agenda is destroying them.\n\nAnd yet, like all addicts, they choose destruction over abandoning their self-destructive

campus Communist turned conservative kingmaker put the ‘social’ in ‘social movement’","text":"Gen Z calls it “rizz.”\n\nConservative theorist Frank Meyer radiated it.\n\nRizz is what Donald Trump exudes and Kamala Harris lacks, and this je ne sais quoi quality, at least to all who came before Gen Z brilliantly put a name on it, explains not just one’s success on Hinge but whether a political figure can pull a crowd.\n\nMarble-mouthed mumblers and shoegazers take note: It turns out people follow the very individuals in mass movements they follow around in social situations.\n\nFrank Meyer’s 3D, pops-off-the-page life illustrates this truth.\n\nAfter the Newark-born Meyer acted as the pied piper of campus Communism in 1930s England, he remarkably became in America during the 1960s, as the title of my new biography puts it, the man who invented conservatism.\n\nBritish intelligence conducted a black-bag job on his apartment, placed a mail cover on his correspondence and noted the bars he frequented, the tweed he wore and the frequent female company he kept as they tailed him. \n\nNowhere in the 161 pages of the declassified Meyer files do agents memorialize on paper that the revolutionary they followed — described therein as “the founder” of the student Communist movement — dated the big boss’ daughter.\n\nThe most Frank Meyer thing Frank Meyer ever did was enter into a relationship with Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald’s youngest child as he conspicuously called for the violent overthrow of the British government the man led. \n\nChe, Lenin and Mao never pulled off such a brash caper.\n\n“Come here at 7.0 — or if you don’t like the idea of Downing Street — even though I am the sole occupant at the moment — fix any other place you like,” Sheila MacDonald wrote Meyer in one of their letters I discovered in an Altoona, Penn., warehouse during research for “The Man Who Invented Conservatism: The Unlikely Life of Frank S. Meyer,” out Aug. 19.\n\nPredictably, the British government sought to deport Meyer (and, predictably, Miss MacDonald volunteered to intervene). \n\nThe same rizz that placed the prime minister’s daughter in his arms brought a phalanx of famous Brits to his defense.\n\nClement Attlee, future prime minister, pleaded his case in Parliament. \n\nA petition signed by philosopher Bertrand Russell, “Howards End” and “A Passage to India” author E.M. Forster and Labour Party leader (and Angela Lansbury’s grandfather) George Lansbury called the deportation “discrimination” prompted by the cause célèbre’s “left-wing politics.” \n\nStudents marched about London chanting, “Free Frank Meyer!”\n\nWomen desired his romantic attention. Rizz meant men wanted his company, too.\n\nIn 1930, an unknown Pottstown, Penn., prep-school teacher plaintively petitioned Meyer for more “scintillating conversations” and “provocative” letters. \n\nHe wished to again drink with Meyer and “to take a Cook’s Tour of this particular part of the world with you.” Without Meyer’s company, he confessed, he inhabited an “intellectual desert.”\n\nThe sycophantic missive came from the typewriter of James A. Michener long before he won a Pulitzer Prize for “Tales of the South Pacific.”\n\nBy 1949, when Meyer testified against former comrades in the Foley Square trial — the longest, most expensive court case in US history to that point — he had witnessed much evil.\n\nHe knew that Prince Mirsky, the force who pushed him to join the Communist Party, had disappeared in a Soviet gulag; his protégé, Charles Darwin’s great-grandson John Cornford, had died fighting in the Spanish Civil War; his boss on “peace” activism, Walter Ulbricht (who later built the Berlin Wall), went about making the lives of East Germans hell; and his American idol, longtime party chief Earl Browder, had transformed overnight in Communist rhetoric from a brilliant, courageous leader into a perfidious enemy of the people.\n\nSlowly, he embraced a very different outlook. Quickly, and characteristically, the conservative convert became conservative pope.\n\nPresent at the creation of National Review, the Conservative Party of New York, the Philadelphia Society, the American Conservative Union and Young Americans for Freedom, Meyer helped erect the skeletal structure of the conservative movement.\n\nGoing to Woodstock meant something very different for 1960s young conservatives. Those making the obligatory pilgrimage to his farmhouse there included Joan Didion, who credited him as the editor who first published her freelance work, Garry Wills, who said he spent more time with this mentor in the late 1950s and early 1960s than anyone outside his family, and Heritage Foundation founder Ed Feulner.\n\nHis philosophy, fusionism, became the default outlook of the American right from Barry Goldwater well through Ronald Reagan, who cheered that Meyer had “fashioned a vigorous new synthesis of traditional and libertarian thought — a synthesis that is today recognized by many as modern conservatism.”\n\nWhat made conservatives so easily follow a former Communist? Rizz.\n\nThose doubting the power of rizz may wish to apply this test to every presidential election in their lifetimes: Did the winning candidate also win the rizz contest?\n\nUndertaker-face John Kerry lost to George W. Bush in 2004. John McCain, who looked like he walked off the set of a black-and-white television show, lost to Technicolor Barack Obama in 2008. Monotone Gerald Ford lost to Jimmy Carter with his ear-to-ear grin and mellifluous diction in 1976. \n\nAnd a fist-in-the-air, “Fight”-shouting Donald Trump — far from the cranky, complaining COVID case of 2020 — triumphed over word-salad chef Kamala Harris in 2024.\n\nFrank Meyer understood the power of rizz long before Twitch streamer Kai Cenat popularized the term.\n\nThey don’t call them social movements for nothing.\n\nDaniel J.

When the film came out, I felt that those who are against Israel criticized me in a very personal, almost visceral way,” she added.\n\n“They saw me, first and foremost, as an Israeli, not as an actress. That’s the perspective I spoke from when I answered the question.”\n\nGadot, 40, wrote that the live-action Disney remake didn’t “fail solely because of external pressures.”\n\n“There are many factors that determine why a film succeeds or fails, and success is never guaranteed!” she concluded.\n\nDuring a recent appearance on Israeli TV show “The A Talks,” the “Wonder Woman” actress revealed why she believed “Snow White” was considered a “major flop.”\n\n“I was sure this movie was going to be a huge hit. And then it happened,” she said, referencing the Oct. 7 attacks in which Hamas terrorists launched a brutal attack on Israel.\n\n“And what followed, as you know, what happened a lot in various industries, including Hollywood, there’s pressure on celebrities to speak against Israel,” Gadot continued.\n\n“I can always explain and try to give context about what’s happening here and I always do that. But, in the end, people make their own decisions.”\n\nThe “Red Notice” star said she was “disappointed the movie was so affected and it didn’t succeed at the box office.” \n\n“That’s how it goes. You win some, you lose some,” she said.\n\nGadot, who played the Evil Queen, and Rachel Zegler, who portrayed Snow White, were both involved in controversies while filming and promoting the movie, which grossed $205.6 million worldwide against a production budget of $240 to $270 million.\n\nFans initially criticized Disney for casting a Latina as Snow White.\n\nZegler, 24, then faced backlash for saying the plot of the animated “Snow White” film was “dated” because the prince “literally stalks Snow White.”\n\nThe “West Side Story” star was also slammed for voicing her support for Palestine and sharing an anti-President Donald Trump Instagram post after he defeated Kamala Harris in the 2024 election last November.\n\nAfter people called for Zegler to be fired from the live-action film, she issued an apology, saying she had let her “emotions get the best of” her when she spoke about the election.\n\nMeanwhile, Gadot, who is Jewish, has been an outspoken supporter of Israel on social media, which has garnered some backlash from fans.\n\nIn March, the mom of four’s Hollywood Walk of Fame ceremony was interrupted by pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian protesters.\n\nAdditionally, Gadot had to beef up security after she received death threats about her views. \n\nIt was reported that the co-stars clashed while making the Disney film due to them having “nothing in common.”","summary":"“They saw me, first and foremost, as an Israeli, not as an actress.

The first, viral posts of sorority girls dancing, part of the #RushTok trend that's been picking up steam as university life kicks off in August. The second, equally viral posts that the left is mad about it.Social media is inundated with posts claiming that the videos of sorority girls are proof that America is \"back,\" a return prompted by the election of President Donald Trump and a cultural shift toward conservatism.If the narrative online is to be believed, the comeback has come much to the dismay of the left. But how mad is the left really? While posts outlining their outrage in response to sorority girls receive millions of views online, the outrage itself is harder to find.As the right zeros in on sorority girls as evidence of a changing political culture, they are ushered into the echelons of the conservative hot girl, a new-age political pin-up, that this time comes complete with choreographed dances and coordinated outfits.But are these videos actually having a political impact outside of the right, or is the idea that they are an invented issue to fan the flames of a culture war? Newsweek spoke with experts to find out more.The Viral Phenomenon of the Sorority GirlStanding in front of red, brick buildings, adorned by circular columns and Greek lettering, sorority girls dance in unison. The movements are synchronized, the smiles are wide, and the energy is infectious.And millions of pairs of eyes fall upon the videos. Sororities and fraternities have been a cornerstone of pop culture for decades, in part thanks to movies like Legally Blonde, The House Bunny and Neighbors. Videos like this have been going viral over the past few years, but they have largely been divorced from political conversations, until now.This interest, though, isn't surprising, according to Diana Z. O'Brien, a professor of political science at Washington University in St. Louis.\"For years, there's been extensive media coverage of how both universities and young women tend to lean left politically,\" O'Brien said. \"Against that backdrop, young women at universities participating in activities perceived as more conservative—such as joining certain sororities—is going to spark the interest of some observers.\"The direct response to these videos is often positive. The comment sections are filled with fire emojis, compliments on their outfits and replies like \"go girls!\"But with great virality comes great visibility, and there is a significant amount of negativity in response to this trend. According to a recent report from The Independent, some sorority girls have stepped away from posting, and some sororities have advised against posting, or, speaking to the press.Some sororities regularly going viral include Alpha Chi Omega, University of South Carolina; Kappa Kappa Gamma, Oklahoma State University; Alpha Chi Omega, University of Tennessee; Delta Gamma, University of Tennessee; and Delta Zeta, University of Georgia. Newsweek has contacted these sororities for comment via social media message.Looking at the content, it appears there is little either tangentially or tangibly political about it. But that hasn't stopped it from becoming a political symbol.Joe Kinsey, of the outlet Outkick, wrote in a post on X: \"The purple hair lesbians have to be furious that SEC sororities ARE BACK.\" As of press time, that post has been viewed 37 million times.In an email shared with Newsweek, Kinsey said: \"After years of being told that biological males should be in the pool winning national championships over U.S. Olympic female swimmers, and that it was the fair thing to do, this country is back to a place where sorority girls & Sydney Sweeney now run the show, and a huge swath of America seems to love that cultural shift.\"He continued: \"Have sorority girls always been doing their thing since TikTok was invented? Sure, but pop culture narratives were being run by fanatics on the coasts with the help of their sympathetic friends in the left-wing media. This country has clearly experienced a shift in the dominant voices with sororities and Sweeney appearing ready to lead the way.\"Kinsey's comments reference first the discourse over trans women competing in women's sports, something that has been a hot button issue in online culture wars for years. In February, Trump signed an executive order blocking trans women from participating in women's sports, which has been condemned and criticized by advocacy groups and the LGBTQ+ community.A post on X from Fox News about the phenomenon reads in part: \"The viral 'RushTok' trend is making waves once more, with some calling it proof that \"America is back,\" describing sorority girls as \"warriors on the frontline of TikTok\" pushing back on lockdown-era culture and showing renewed Gen Z patriotism.\" The post has been viewed more than 450,000 times as of reporting.On the other side of the coin, though, are people arguing that there isn't a real political connection here. One post shared a video of the sorority Texas Aephi, University of Austin, and was captioned \"MAGA Texas girls are beautiful.\" The post was shared by an account that highlighted that the sorority is in Austin, which is in Travis County, which voted for then-Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024.Generally speaking, when it comes to politics, young women tend to identify as liberal. Polling from Gallup shows that an average of 40 percent of young women identified as liberal between 2017 and 2024, an increase from 32 percent for 2008 to 2016, and from 28 percent for 2001 to 2007.Newsweek spoke with pop culture content creator Morgan Harris, aka @Yaptrapped, about this trend.\"The schools that are famous in Rushtok and really gave rise to it are mostly located in the South, I think these sorts of videos can act as a sort of advertisement for who conservative young women are even though in reality you have no idea of the political leanings of everyone that is in that video,\" Harris said.O'Brien echoed this, telling Newsweek that the conversations should center on the sorority members themselves, rather than \"just the political meanings outsiders attach to them.\"New Chapter in the Culture Wars PlaybookAmid the disparate online discourse about the trend lies a question: Why are social media trends like this used in online culture wars, and what role do they play?Dr. Mary Anne Franks, Eugene L. and Barbara A. Bernard professor in intellectual property, technology and civil rights law at George Washington University Law School, told Newsweek via email: \"Fabricated controversies are the currency of the online culture wars, and that is why the right tends to win them.\"\"Outrage bait like \"liberals HATE this new trend!\" doesn't just activate tired stereotypes and trigger negative emotional responses, it also serves to distract us from true outrages and exhaust the psychological resources we need to process and respond to them,\" Franks said.Newsweek also spoke with Dr. Stacey Kerr, an independent researcher, and Mardi Schmeichel, an associate professor in the College of Education and Human Sciences at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, who shared joint responses about the trend.\"The political right's framing of sorority videos as \"making the left mad,\" despite no evidence of widespread outrage, is a classic right-wing tactic: manufacturing a fake conflict as a way to signal dominance,\" they said.\"The truth of the claim doesn't matter; in fact, the falsity is part of the point. By claiming that feminists and liberals are furious, right-wing commentators get to perform a win on two fronts: they cast themselves as lighthearted defenders of \"fun\" and \"tradition\" and they invite their audience to savor the imagined spectacle of their opponents seething.\"\"Part of why this works so well in the context of RushTok is its sheer popularity: the videos draw huge audiences and have become an easy cultural reference point,\" they added.Newsweek also spoke with Deen Freelon, a professor at the Annenberg School for Communication, University of Pennsylvania, about the trend.\"This seems to be the latest iteration of a broader phenomenon in which conservative individuals accuse left-leaning people of holding views the latter deny holding,\" Freelon said.\"I think it shows how little the right understands the left [although the opposite may be true as well], and how much popularity and money there is to be gained in stoking division around even the most trivial of matters,\" Freelon added.Pom-poms, Pep, and PoliticsThe online obsession with sorority girls comes at a time when conservative politics has become obsessed more generally with women. Whether it's the rise of the conservative hot girl, the proliferation of the trad wife, or the conservative female influencer, the face of right-wing politics is changing. There's a new political poster girl in town, and she's putting on her MAGA cap with a manicured hand.While the actual politics of sorority girls is blurry, the aesthetic plays into the shift and new gendered era of politics that has been unfolding online in recent years. This may be playing a part in why conservatives have latched onto this content.Catherine Rottenberg of Goldsmiths, University of London, told Newsweek: \"These images of sorority girls dancing and ostensibly celebrating 'America'—are part of a larger MAGA gendered aesthetic.\"Rottenberg said that the celebration of these clubs and organizations, and the way they are framed, reinforces a gender binary: \"The idea that we need women to be women and men to be men.\"Rottenberg added that while distraction might be \"part of the strategy,\" with this trend, it is also indicative of a wider promotion of \"ideas of gender and femininity.\"Kerr and Schmeichel echoed this, telling Newsweek: \"Women's bodies and choices have always been a political battleground, and the women participating in these hyper-feminized sorority performances are primed to serve as avatars for a \"victorious\" traditional America, with young, white, conventionally attractive women joyfully embracing old-school femininity in open defiance of what the right paints as liberal efforts to stamp it out.\"The content creator @yaptrapped highlighted a similar theme, telling Newsweek: \"Conservatives need beautiful young conservative women to sell the dream of the traditional family to young conservative men and so I can see how those videos would be a powerful advertisement for that, even though it is a false advertisement based on details you couldn't possibly know about people in an internet video.\"","summary":"The newest political pin-up has choreographed dances and coordinated outfits, and may be a symbol of the latest chapter in a series of online culture wars.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/college-sorority-girl-rush-tok-conservative-left-liberal-america-politcs-2114120","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2702705/sorority-girls-are-rights-latest-obsession.png?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=59a3f99ed08e4ce41e3a27f279d4d0a3","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-17 09:00:03","author":"Marni Rose McFall","authors":["Marni Rose McFall"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.085},{"id":351784576,"title":"Donald Trump's Approval Rating Plummets With Millennials","text":"President Donald Trump's approval rating has plummeted with millennials, hitting its lowest level of the year in August, according to new polling.According to YouGov/Economist polling, in June, 40 percent of millennials approved of Trump's job performance while 53 percent disapproved—a net rating of -13 points. That slid to 41-57 (-16) in July before plunging to 33-56 (-23) in August.The figures show a 10-point drop in net approval in just two months, underscoring growing dissatisfaction among millennials as the 2025 political season intensifies.Why It MattersTrump, who has long highlighted strong polling at rallies and press events, now faces slipping approval ratings that could weaken his influence and hurt Republican prospects in the 2026 midterms.After returning to the White House in January with solid numbers, his support has eroded amid economic concerns, tariff backlash and political discontent. Trump and former Vice President Kamala Harris have turned to podcasts and digital outreach to court millennials, a generation wary of legacy media and traditional messaging.Millennials are defined generally as people born from 1981 to 1996. The generation has overtaken baby boomers as the largest age demographic, according to the Pew Research Center.What To KnowThe poll shows that Trump's declining popularity among millennials is being driven by worsening views on the economy and inflation.\"Millennials have yet to see the sweeping national renewal Trump promised,\" Thomas Gift, an associate professor of political science and director of the Centre on US Politics at University College London, told Newsweek.On the economy, Trump's approval among millennials slipped from 36 percent approval and 52 percent disapproval in June to 38 percent approval and 54 percent disapproval in August, showing that approval and disapproval has edged up the same.Inflation also appears to be a particular weak spot. Approval in this area dropped from 33 percent in June to 27 percent in August, while disapproval rose from 58 percent to 60 percent. The shift suggests heightened concern among younger voters about persistent price pressures.That comes as inflation rose to 2.7 percent in June despite Trump's previous promise to end inflation on day one of his second term.\"Starting on day one, we will end inflation and make America affordable again, to bring down the prices of all goods,\" he said during a rally in Bozeman, Montana, in August 2024.Meanwhile, job growth slowed sharply in July, with just 73,000 new jobs added—down from 147,000 the previous month, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. After last month's jobs report was published, Trump fired BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer. In a post, Trump accused McEntarfer—without offering evidence—of rigging the numbers to harm his administration. But that move by Trump was not popular among millennial voters, with only 16 percent saying the decision was justified.There are also concerns about Trump's tariff program. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick predicted $50 billion in monthly revenue from the new import taxes, which came into effect this month. But JPMorgan warned that 60 percent of the increased costs are expected to be passed on to American consumers through higher prices.\"On the consumer side, many remain burdened by rising prices under his tariffs, while housing in particular continues to be out of reach for a generation still struggling to get a foothold on the economic ladder,\" said Gift. According to Federal Reserve data, millennials own less than two-thirds of the real estate that baby boomers owned at the same age.But it's not all bad news for Trump. His handling of immigration remains a relative bright spot with this age group. Approval rose from 33 percent to 41 percent over the same period, while disapproval fell from 58 percent to 50 percent, marking an 8-point net improvement.Throughout his second term, Trump has aggressively expanded immigration enforcement—launching mass deportation operations, increasing raids in sanctuary cities and reviving thousands of old deportation cases.His administration has also dramatically scaled up detention capacity, allocating $45 billion to expand ICE facilities and construct large-scale temporary camps, including a facility in Florida nicknamed \"Alligator Alcatraz.\"But while Trump has continued to push the hardline immigration agenda that helped him win support in 2024, polls indicate that backing for those policies is fading across other demographic groups.Gallup polling from last month showed that 30 percent of Americans now say immigration levels should be reduced, down from 55 percent in 2024. Support for maintaining or increasing immigration has risen across the board, including among Republicans.More broadly, the number of Americans who view immigration as a \"good thing\" has reached an all-time high of 79 percent, the same poll shows, reversing a steady decline during Joe Biden's presidency and surpassing levels from Trump's first term.What Happens NextTrump's new nominee to run the BLS, E.J.

Vance reminds us that Democrats have a problem with men","text":"A recent hit piece on Vice President J.D. Vance from a British newspaper reminds me of a real and ongoing image crisis facing Democrats, and it’s largely one of their own making. However, based on everything they have done to this point and what their allies are suggesting they do next, it’s apparent that they have absolutely no idea how to solve it.\n\nIt’s not a secret that the rigid behavioral requirements and speech codes the radical left tries to enforce have contributed to the rapid flight of male voters away from the Democratic Party. Perhaps sensing it, heading into the 2024 presidential election, they correctly figured they needed a dose of masculinity on their ticket to remedy the problem.\n\nPresidential candidate Kamala Harris then did one of the funniest things possible: She chose Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate.\n\nAs many will remember, Mr. Walz did his best Elmer Fudd impression when he went hunting on the campaign trail and somehow managed to participate in the entire event without firing a single shot. The embarrassing attempt at being an outdoorsman was crammed between rallies in which the governor would flounce on stage while fluttering jazz hands all over the place.\n\nThat brings us to The Guardian’s attack on Mr. Vance. The Guardian, a lefty publication from London, published a story that was almost a parody of biased journalism. It was that silly.\n\nIt was also an obvious effort to draw blood from the clear favorite for the Republican presidential nomination in 2028. The paper attacked Mr. Vance for doing something outdoorsy (what a coincidence) with his family: a canoe excursion during a trip home to Ohio at the beginning of this month.\n\nTo effectively protect the vice president in a canoe that can operate in very shallow water, the Secret Service asked that the water flow in the Little Miami River be increased so that agents could employ motorized watercraft. Neither Mr. Vance nor his office was even aware of the Secret Service request, yet The Guardian blasted away as if it were a terrific scandal.\n\nThe story was based mainly on one source, the identity of whom the paper acknowledged it did not know. It included the fact that it “could not independently confirm” the source’s most click-baity claim that the water increase was meant to improve the vice president’s boating conditions. The story also failed to explain how allowing more water to flow from a lake could cost taxpayers anything.\n\nIn short, it was a hatchet job, not a particularly good or convincing one.\n\nThe point is that the left still knows that it has a problem on its side of the fence, and it remains utterly clueless about identifying any solutions.\n\nTake, for example, a recent piece from the same British newspaper, The Guardian.\n\nColumnist Aaron Timms lamented that the “rightwing sports bro” had emerged as a key voting demographic in the 2024 election to help propel President Trump to victory.\n\nUrging Democrats to do better, he wrote that “it’s possible to be passionate and knowledgeable about sports while eschewing the ugliness of bro culture,” keeping with the great leftist tradition of insulting the very voters they are trying to attract.\n\nThen he really went off the rails, saying that sports “offer a rich canvas for the exploration of many issues about which the left cares deeply: race, gender, class, social mobility and the corrupting influence of money.”\n\nYes, what better way to win over a 24-year-old male voter than to sidle up to him at halftime of a football game and say, “Hey, how about that first half? Can you believe that the racist patriarchy deprived us of President Harris?”\n\nYes, Democrats have a problem with men, but it’s probably more accurate to say they have a problem with a lot of humans.\n\nWho among us, male or female, wants to be subjected to hectoring and lecturing all the time? Who wants to be told always to behave and speak a certain way, to be allowed to hold only certain, approved political beliefs?\n\nAs for men, they have been told for years by the left that they’re the cause of most of the problems the world faces, which leads the Democrats to the place they are right now, with males fleeing the party.\n\nThey will not fix this by attacking the vice president for a canoe trip or by jamming lefty grievance politics down every sports fan’s throat. Democrats can fix it only by being authentic and dragging themselves out of the suicide pact they appear to have made with the radical left.\n\nWe all know that’s not going to happen.\n\n• Tim Murtaugh is a Washington Times columnist and founder of Line Drive Public Affairs.

Democrats don’t seem to have a game plan to counter his agenda. That said, midterm elections are tough and looming.\n\nThe One Big Beautiful Bill Act is the centerpiece of the president’s success since Jan. 20. It includes the largest tax cut in American history, increasing Americans’ take-home pay by as much as $13,300. It also eliminates government benefits for illegal aliens and limits Medicaid to needy families, children and seniors.\n\nCongress also passed Mr. Trump’s plan to cut $9 billion in wasteful government spending by axing funds for foreign aid scams and biased public broadcasting. Hopefully, it is the beginning of a much larger reduction in spending at the federal level.\n\nThe economy continues to grow, with a net increase of more than 670,000 jobs since January. Prices are declining, with the cost of a dozen eggs down 53% since the inauguration. Summer gas prices are the lowest since 2021.\n\nGaining control of the border has been the most significant success for the Trump administration. In June, zero illegal aliens were released into the United States. Compare that with June 2024, when 27,766 were released on the Biden administration’s watch amid the yearslong border crisis.\n\nIn addition to stopping the flow of illegal aliens into the U.S. interior, the Trump administration has removed more than 600 known and suspected terrorists from the country as part of the deportation efforts.\n\nCutting government red tape is helping lower costs for consumers and employers nationwide. Unleashing American energy is having short- and long-term success.\n\nEchoing President Reagan’s policy of peace through strength, Mr. Trump is keeping us out of endless wars while blocking Iran from having nuclear weapons. His leadership has led to numerous peace agreements, with more on the horizon.\n\nPresidential executive orders are keeping men out of women’s sports and protecting minors from chemical and surgical mutilation. Mr. Trump is also protecting Jewish students on campuses across the country, ending censorship and stopping racial discrimination through woke programs.\n\nIn contrast, Democrats do not appear to have a plan to counter Mr. Trump’s agenda, except to complain every time he says or does something. That said, they are still likely to pick up seats in the midterm elections.\n\nForty years ago, Republicans lost seats in the midterm elections even after Reagan’s historic reelection in 1984. However, the elections in 2026 could be somewhat different for various reasons.\n\nThe map of states with Senate races in 2026 favors Republicans. Democrats need to pick up four seats to retake the majority. Most of the races in 2026 are in states that Mr. Trump won easily in 2024.\n\nGeorgia, Michigan and North Carolina are considered to be “toss-ups.” Maine is considered to “lean Republican” because Sen. Susan M. Collins is running for reelection in the state that former Vice President Kamala Harris carried in November. The race could move to “toss-up” if Gov. Janet Mills gets in.\n\nMr. Trump carried Michigan, and Sen. Gary C. Peters announced he is not running for reelection. Former Rep. Mike Rogers is running again. In 2024, he fell short of victory by just three-tenths of a point.\n\nGeorgia is another state where Republican leaders are optimistic about picking up a Senate seat. Gov. Brian Kemp and the statewide Republican ticket won impressive victories in 2022. Mr. Trump carried the state by more than 2 percentage points in November.\n\nDemocrats did pick up a prime candidate by recruiting former Gov. Roy Cooper to run for the Senate seat in North Carolina. That said, I traveled the state with Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley, who will be an excellent candidate. He should keep it red.\n\nLiberals consistently claim that Texas is turning blue, but recent elections don’t support that contention. That said, a nasty Republican primary could make the general election more competitive. Just as important, it could draw money away from races where the Republicans could pick up a seat.\n\nThe chances of Republicans holding the majority in the House of Representatives, however, are much tighter than in the Senate. Since World War II, the president’s party has lost congressional seats in 18 of the 20 midterm elections.\n\nTo hold the House, Republicans must be aggressive on several key issues: prices and the economy, border security and public safety, and cultural issues such as protecting women’s sports.\n\nMr. Trump has fulfilled most of his campaign promises. In a world where voters are cynical about politicians breaking their pledges, those aligned with the president can point to big wins.\n\nThe largest area of uncertainty for voters is the economy. If prices drop and jobs are plentiful, Republican wins will be likely in 2026. The president and congressional Republicans need to focus like a laser beam on the three T’s: taxes, trade and terrible government spending.\n\nIf they get those right, prices will go down and they can hold the House, Senate and White House in 2026.\n\n• Scott Walker is a columnist for The Washington Times.

Woodson Sr. has long been a critic of the mainstream media for pushing the narrative that America is inherently racist, but he’s particularly offended by The New York Times and MSNBC’s Al Sharpton. Woodson, 88, penned an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal last week, urging the nation to \"disregard race in how we judge one another\" before it leads to \"national ruin.\" He believes the media has been \"demeaning the values of the country in the name of promoting social justice.\" Woodson has been an outspoken critic of The New York Times’ controversial 1619 Project, which aimed to \"reframe\" America’s history through the lens of slavery. The 1619 Project won a Pulitzer Prize but has been criticized for historical inaccuracies, and Woodson is furious that it has been integrated and insinuated into the curriculum around the country. \"It is embedding in America that America should be defined by its birth defect of slavery,\" Woodson told Fox News Digital. HOW MAINSTREAM MEDIA BECAME 'PART OF THE RACE GRIEVANCE INDUSTRY' HARMING BLACK NEIGHBORHOODS Because of Nikole Hannah-Jones' 1619 Project, along with other coverage, Woodson said the Times has been among the most egregious mainstream news organizations when it comes to belittling the values of the country. \"The New York Times has been the leading culprit in condemning the country, burning the flags, and celebrating those who demean these values. It is, in fact, those same values of the founders that enabled Blacks to survive slavery in Jim Crow,\" Woodson said. AL SHARPTON HITS BACK AT TRUMP ACCUSATION ABOUT PAID ENDORSEMENT OF KAMALA HARRIS A New York Times spokesperson provided Fox News Digital with the following comment: \"This 1619 Project was a piece of deep and original reporting that brought to light new and underexplored truths, and it's only natural that principled and rigorous reporting like this would spark reflection and discussion. The series deepened many readers' understanding of the nation's past, the lingering effects of slavery and its centrality to America’s story and the significant contributions of Black Americans to this country.\" The statement continued: \"Readers have benefited immensely from the groundbreaking journalism of Nikole Hannah-Jones and the full team of writers and editors who brought us this transformative work. The New York Times is proud to continue pursuing vital journalism like this.\" With regard to the comment about flag burning, the Times spokesperson added: \"In fact, the central essay of the 1619 Project, the one that won a Pulitzer Prize, made a case for why Black Americans should embrace the flag, and the illustrated book that came out last year featured a gallery of patriotic images of people with the flag.\" Woodson also has a bone to pick with Sharpton, an MSNBC weekend host who often leads divisive rallies and put his network in an awkward situation ahead of the 2024 presidential election. MSNBC admitted it was \"unaware\" that Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign paid $500,000 to Sharpton’s National Action Network nonprofit ahead of a friendly interview with the Democratic nominee.

Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom called for mid-decade redistricting in the state after it was reported that Texas would redraw its House lines with the intention of flipping five House seats from blue to red. (RELATED: ‘Fetal Position’: Newsom’s Attempt To Gerrymander Already-Lopsided California May Be Over Before It Begins)\n\nIf enacted, the map would likely result in a California House delegation of 48 Democrats and only four Republicans — meaning the GOP would only control 8% of seats. Meanwhile, Texas’ new proposed map would likely result in a House delegation of 30 Republicans and eight Democrats — with Democrats likely controlling 21% of seats — still a higher percentage than the 17% of current California House seats held by Republicans.\n\n 🚨🚨 The final draft map from the California state legislature is now public.

California unlike Texas requires a ballot initiative to pass its proposed mid-decade map.\n\nThe Republican incumbents the proposed California map targets are California Reps. Doug LaMalfa, Ken Calvert, Darrell Issa, Kevin Kiley and David Valadao.\n\nLaMalfa and Calvert’s districts have both been in Republican hands for decades. The gerrymandered map seeks to replace both of their seats with safely Democratic ones.\n\nLaMalfa has since 2013 represented California’s 1st congressional district, which currently covers a sprawling rural area stretching from the state’s Oregon and Nevada state lines to just north of Sacramento. The seat has been held by Republicans since 1981 and LaMalfa won the 2024 election by a landslide margin of 30 percentage points.\n\nIn California Democrats’ newly proposed map, the 1st district would be reconfigured to stretch into Sonoma County’s wine country. Failed Democratic nominee Kamala Harris won the deep blue county with over 70% of the vote in 2024.\n\n California’s State Constitution prohibits politicians from drawing their own districts and doing mid-decade redistricting. Yet Democrat Members of Congress, Gavin Newsom, and Democrat Legislators (some who want to be members of Congress) are conspiring behind closed doors to draw… — Rep. Doug LaMalfa (@RepLaMalfa) August 7, 2025 \n\nCalvert, who was first elected to Congress in 1993, represents the 41st district in Southern California, stretching from Palm Springs to Corona. Calvert won reelection in 2024 by 3.4 points in a previously safe Republican district that was redrawn to be competitive following the 2020 census.\n\nHowever, under the new map, Calvert’s current seat would be eliminated and replaced with a heavily Democratic district just east of Los Angeles.\n\n“I strongly oppose the scheme being orchestrated behind closed doors by Sacramento politicians to take constitutionally afforded power away from the Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission and replace it with a process that would allow legislators to draw district maps that are gerrymandered to benefit themselves and their political allies,” Calvert told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “A partisan political gerrymander is not what the voters of California want as they clearly stated when they passed the VOTERS FIRST Act and participated in the Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission process.”\n\n 64% of Californians oppose Gavin Newsom’s power grab. It’s clear there is bipartisan support for keeping the Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission and not allowing politicians to draw their district maps behind closed doors to choose their voters. https://t.co/YYlkNhZBVc — Rep. Ken Calvert (@KenCalvert) August 14, 2025 \n\nIssa, who was elected to Congress in 2001, represents the 48th district that reaches from California’s southern border to just east of San Clemente. While Issa easily won his 2024 reelection bid by 18.6 points, the new map would shift his district from being strongly Republican to being Democratic leaning.\n\nKiley, who is in his second term representing California’s 3rd district spanning from the Sacramento suburbs to the California-Nevada border, defeated former Newsom appointee Jessica Morse in 2024 by 11 points. The Democrats’ new map seeks to add more Democratic areas by the state capital to Kiley’s district, effectively putting reelection out of reach for the incumbent.\n\nKiley is also spearheading a bill to ban mid-decade redistricting nationwide and has called for California to preserve its Citizens Redistricting Commission.\n\n“It was the voters themselves that said, ‘We want to take the politics and the politicians out of redistricting and have this done by an independent citizens commission,’ and the voters stand by that judgment,” Kiley said during a Thursday night appearance on MSNBC. “Democrats, Republicans, Independents all overwhelmingly favor keeping the Independent Commission because they know that when politicians are in charge of drawing district lines, that’s an inherent conflict of interests, because they’re then going to go and run in those districts.” \n\n Once again Gavin Newsom is the great uniter. A Politico poll shows Democrats, Republicans, and Independents are all overwhelmingly opposed to his corrupt redistricting scheme. pic.twitter.com/cky77tneGK — Kevin Kiley (@KevinKileyCA) August 15, 2025 \n\nThe Central Valley-based 22nd district represented by Valadao will be redrawn to be slightly more Democratic under the new map. Valadao’s current seat, which voted for former President Joe Biden by double digits, notably swung nearly 20 points to the right in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nFurthermore, California Democrats’ new proposed map also seeks to add more Democratic voters to the seats represented by California’s half dozen vulnerable Democratic incumbents, Reps. Adam Gray, Josh Harder, Mike Levin, Dave Min, Derek Tran and George Whitesides.\n\nThe nine members of the California Republican House Delegation released a joint statement Thursday on a recent poll revealing Californians greatly disapprove of the motion to override the independent redistricting commission.\n\n“Governor Newsom is trying to grab power away from the citizens on the commission and give it to Sacramento politicians to gerrymander their own districts,” the legislators wrote in the statement. “Our delegation will stand with the citizens of California and defend their rights as they stand today in our state constitution by opposing Newsom’s ballot measure. All Californians, regardless of their political affiliation, should vote NO on this attempt to eliminate the Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission’s ability to draw fair congressional districts.”\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Red states or blue ones?","text":"Is artificial intelligence coming for your job? It may depend on who you voted for in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nIf you voted for Donald Trump, your job is likely safe.\n\nIf you voted for Kamala Harris, you have reason to be concerned.\n\nQuietly last month, Microsoft released a study of the jobs most and least likely to be replaced by artificial intelligence. The study results track closely to the socioeconomics of the 2024 presidential election and the political realignment sweeping the nation.\n\nThe jobs most likely to be displaced by artificial intelligence fit the profile of the college-educated elite who are backing the Democratic Party. These jobs include writers and authors, reporters, historians, and political scientists.\n\nThese are roles rooted in so-called knowledge work, which is the gathering and interpreting of information, producing written content, and communicating ideas. These are the tasks artificial intelligence currently does best.\n\nThe jobs least likely to be displaced are the blue-collar workers who are building the new Republican majority. These jobs include highway maintenance workers, cement masons, painters, and truck drivers. All roles with a high physical component and minimal overlap with AI’s current capabilities.\n\nNationwide, about 8.5 million jobs are at the highest risk of being replaced by AI. Based on an analysis of Microsoft and state data, in Pennsylvania, that represents a little under 300,000 jobs. Conversely, about 5.5 million jobs nationwide, and roughly 240,000 in Pennsylvania, are in categories least likely to be affected.\n\nThe Microsoft study’s methodology is worth noting. Researchers analyzed 200,000 anonymized conversations between Americans and Bing Copilot, classifying the “user goals” and the “AI actions” according to work activities defined by the U.S. Department of Labor’s O/NET database.\n\nBy measuring how frequently AI assisted with or performed these activities, how successfully it did so, and how broad the potential impact was, they created an “AI applicability score” for each occupation.\n\nThese roles share a heavy reliance on information gathering, writing, editing, and communicating, which are areas where AI already demonstrates high task completion rates and broad applicability.\n\nFrom a political standpoint, the study’s findings mirror the cultural and economic realignment of the last decade. The Democratic coalition has grown more white-collar, more urban, and more dependent on credentialed professions. The Republican base has grown more working-class, more rural or exurban, and concentrated in the skilled trades.\n\nIn short, the jobs that AI is poised to displace are concentrated in the Democratic coalition, while the jobs still untouched by AI are clustered in the Republican one.\n\nThe implication? AI disruption may accelerate the realignment – replacing jobs in industries that overwhelmingly vote blue while leaving red-leaning jobs largely untouched.\n\nBut the study also warns against simple “automation doom” narratives. Many of the most at-risk occupations are not necessarily destined for elimination; they may instead be transformed. AI can assist rather than replace, potentially boosting productivity and changing job descriptions rather than eliminating them entirely.\n\nStill, the scale of potential change is enormous. The biggest concentration is in customer service (2.85 million nationally) and sales representatives (1.14 million nationally), which are fields where AI can already answer questions, present information, and resolve issues with impressive fluency.\n\nAI’s trajectory may mirror past innovations, such as ATMs, which reduced the need for tellers but also enabled banks to expand and redeploy staff. The Microsoft study suggests we may see similar patterns with AI.\n\nYet the cultural dimension is new: automation risk is not spread evenly across the political spectrum. It clearly clusters along partisan lines.\n\nPennsylvania, poised to become the “AI capital of the United States,” will be both the factory floor and the test lab for this disruption – producing the tools that may displace thousands of its own white-collar workers while expanding opportunity for skilled trades.\n\nFor policymakers, the challenge is twofold: they should provide soft landings for those being displaced while ensuring our educational system is producing enough workers with the necessary blue-collar skills to usher in the economy of the future.\n\nDuring the era of globalization, policymakers demonstrated they either did not care or could not help the millions of displaced industrial workers who anchored the American middle class.\n\nThis is an opportunity for GOP policymakers to rise to the occasion to bring even more Americans into its Big Tent by providing solutions for these soon-to-be displaced workers, largely concentrated in the suburbs.\n\nThe study ends on a note of humility as AI’s impact is a moving target. Capabilities will evolve, jobs will adapt, and new occupations will emerge. While truck drivers are on the “safe” list today, self-driving trucks are not far away.\n\nWant to know if AI is coming for your job? Pull up a county-by-county map of the 2024 election.

Obama","text":"Former President Barack Obama railed against Texas for attempting a mid-decade redistricting to create more Republican U.S. House seats.\n\nOn social media, Obama said: “We can’t lose focus on what matters — right now, Republicans in Texas are trying to gerrymander district lines to unfairly win five seats in next year’s midterm elections. This is a power grab that undermines our democracy.”\n\nObama, in 2022, wrote: “Three years ago, I helped @EricHolder launch @AllOnTheLine, a people-powered campaign to fight gerrymandering and advocate for fair redistricting. All On The Line is driven by the core belief that voters should choose their representatives — not the other way around.”\n\nThat “voters should choose their representatives — not the other way around” reflects quite a change in thinking from a politician who skillfully used gerrymandering to protect his Illinois State Senate seat. (RELATED: Kingpin Of Politics Or Desperate To Stay Relevant? Obama Reportedly Calls Rising Socialist Star)\n\nIn 2012, the left-leaning ProPublica wrote “Obama’s Gerrymander — President Obama may have propelled his political career forward by gerrymandering a Chicago district to include rich supporters.”\n\nIllinois State Sen. Obama decided to primary Democrat Illinois U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush, a former Black Panther. Rush painted Obama as a born-and-raised-in-Hawaii, carpetbagging lecturer at the University of Chicago Law School, by way of Harvard Law, who attended prep school and did not have a clue about the life of a typical black person. It worked. Obama not only lost the primary; he performed poorly with black voters.\n\nSo, what did Obama do? He examined the election results and proceeded to gerrymander his State Senate seat to guard against losing it. He reduced the number of those who voted against him and increased the numbers of those who did. In short, Obama rejected the notion that “voters should choose their representatives — not the other way around.”\n\nThe change in his State Senate seat before and after the gerrymander was remarkable. New Yorker reporter Ryan Lizza interviewed John Corrigan, an Illinois Democrat who worked with Obama to redraw the seat. Corrigan called it “a radical change.”\n\nLizza wrote: “Corrigan remembers two things about the district that he and Obama drew. First, it retained Obama’s Hyde Park base — he had managed to beat Rush in Hyde Park — then swooped upward along the lakefront and toward downtown. By the end of the final redistricting process, his new district bore little resemblance to his old one. … Obama’s new district was wealthier, whiter, more Jewish, less blue-collar, and better educated. It also included one of the highest concentrations of Republicans in Chicago.”\n\nAgain, Obama in 2001 gerrymandered his State Senate district to make it less black, more white, more Jewish and more affluent? Presumably this did not come up during the 2024 presidential campaign, when Obama lectured “the brothers” about their reluctance to vote for Kamala Harris.\n\nWhen asked about his newly designed State Senate seat, Obama was dismissive: “The system of redistricting in the U.S. tends to allow representatives to choose people instead of people choosing representatives. It’s just politics.”\n\nObama is not the only one to flip-flop on gerrymandering. Common Cause, a left-leaning “good government” nonprofit worked in California to take redistricting away from politicians. Its website brags: “In 2008, California Common Cause led a coalition that drafted and passed the historic Voters First Act, which took a significant step toward ending gerrymandering in California. This ballot initiative stripped California legislators of the power to draw state legislative districts and created the Citizens Redistricting Commission (CRC). … The CRC is now a national model for redistricting reform.”\n\nBut Common Cause appears to be waffling. Texas is attempting a mid-decade redistricting, something unusual but legal under Texas law. In response, California Gov. Gavin Newsom wants to defy the state law that took redistricting away from the politicians. Newsom said: “If we don’t put a stake into the heart of (the Trump) administration, there may not be an election in 2028. They’re not screwing around. We can’t afford to screw around either. We have got to fight fire with fire.”\n\nWhat does Common Cause now say? A representative says the organization is “swamped” and could “circle back at a later time.” Call it the Obama Gerrymander Rule: When Democrats do it, “It’s just politics.” When Republicans do it, it becomes “a power grab that undermines our democracy.”\n\nLarry Elder is a bestselling author and nationally syndicated radio talk-show host.

It’s not fascism to deport illegal aliens. It’s not fascism to restore peace to American cities.\n\nSo many on the Left live in such a bubble that they have no concept of how fed up Americans are with the rampant looting, the illegals driving mopeds without license plates, the teens skipping subway turnstiles, and the homeless vagrants crowding the sidewalks.\n\nI live in the D.C. area, and in recent years, my best friend was robbed at gunpoint in the nation’s capital. My female co-workers were scared to drive past a certain intersection because homeless men would cat-call them. At that intersection, one homeless man threw another into the street right in front of my car, and I had to jam on my breaks to avoid slamming into him. \n\nStores like CVS have everyday items like cold medicine locked behind glass doors because the crime is so bad. \n\nIt doesn’t have to be this way, and Americans voted for change in November. \n\nThe Left’s Echo Chamber\n\nYet the Left’s echo chamber finds any reason to demonize Trump, and it can be hard to escape that narrative, even if you want to. The legacy media strains to find any outrage when it comes to deporting illegal aliens—never mind the millions who poured across the border under the previous administration. \n\nThe negative media coverage gets a tremendous boost from the organized Left. Groups like the American Civil Liberties Union find any excuse to prevent Trump from deporting illegal aliens, suing to block his policies and turning every law enforcement action into a sob story. \n\nThe Center for American Progress, which fed 60 staff into the Biden administration, now hypocritically calls for “securing the border” despite its own record encouraging Biden to treat immigration “as an asset to be managed rather than a crime to be enforced against.” It demonizes Trump’s “chaos and cruelty” without giving an ounce of credit to the man who has actually secured the border.\n\nAdd in the groups that organize protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement in cities like Los Angeles, and you’ve got real trouble on your hands.\n\nThese activist groups are more entrenched than you may realize. The nonprofits that sued the Trump administration in its first month received at least $1.7 billion in taxpayer funds under Biden.\n\nExpect More Deep State Resistance\n\nSean Charles Dunn had likely been hearing a stream of anti-Trump news on immigration, and after Trump deployed federal law enforcement to Washington, D.C., it seems Dunn just snapped. \n\nIt isn’t just Dunn. An April RMG Research poll found that 75% of D.C.-based federal employees who voted for Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in November said they won’t follow a lawful Trump order if they consider it bad policy.\n\nThese deep state bureaucrats think they know better than the American people and the leaders voters elect, and they’re listening to “experts” that rile them up.\n\nTrump has given these bureaucrats an off-ramp. He offered deferred resignation—agreeing to pay them through the end of the fiscal year (Sept. 30) if they resigned early this year.

Meghan Markle’s Florist’s Pub Reportedly Refused Him Service","text":"A comedy that seems fit for a political gag was born from US Vice President JD Vance‘s summer vacation in the Cotswolds. What started out as a family vacation in the English countryside — with his wife, Usha, and their three kids — has turned into a village commotion, police convoys, and (possibly most embarrassing of all) a supposed refusal of service at a nearby pub that Meghan Markle’s florist owns.\n\nWhen a reservation for the Vance family had been made, employees at The Bull Pub in Charlbury, a haunt for politicians and celebrities, threatened to leave in large numbers, according to reports in The Daily Mail and entertainment gossip website Popbitch.\n\nIn the Cotswolds, where Vance’s vacation has already upset the locals, the episode has become the talk of the town. The Vice President has been escorted by convoys of police cars and hovering helicopters, which have clogged small country roads and irritated locals.\n\nHigh-profile visitors are nothing new to The Bull (Kamala Harris was there just last year), but the idea that JD Vance was ignored by its staff led to controversy. The rebellious employees all said that they would not report to work if they had to serve Vance and his wife, according to Popbitch. The Bull turned away his business due to staff grievances and an upsurge of negative media coverage.\n\nALSO READ: Donald Trump’s Latest Attack on Kamala Harris Proves He’s Still Not Over 2020\n\nOn the other hand, Vance’s team has made an effort to downplay the drama.\n\n“The Bull was included as a potential option for lunch, but the family ultimately decided not to go,” a spokesperson for JD Vance insisted. “There was never any indication from the Bull that he or his family were not welcome.”\n\nEven so, the visuals are indisputable: JD Vance did not enter Meghan Markle’s florist’s pub, whether on purpose or by choice. JD Vance has been a divisive personality in Washington as well ever since he took office as vice president in January 2025. He was once an outspoken opponent of Donald Trump and used to call him “America’s Hitler,” but he is now Trump’s closest political ally!\n\nJD Vance called Donald Trump “America’s Hitler“\nDo you agree?

Journalist Helen Kirwan-Taylor, who lives close to Dean, where the Vances are staying, wrote in The i that the vice president was not just looking for a place to relax: “No one comes to the British version of the Hamptons (…) to listen to birdsong. JD Vance (…) has chosen the axis of privilege, wealth and power (…) for one reason only: influence.”\n\nLocals seem to agree. Residents have complained that security measures have them “sealed off”, satirical billboards ridiculing Vance have started appearing in nearby villages, and even TV personality Jeremy Clarkson weighed in on the mayhem.\n\n“JD Vance has taken over my village – send help,” local Jonathan Mazower told The Telegraph.\n\nActivists in the UK installed a poster in the Cotswolds to greet JD Vance as he takes yet another family vacation pic.twitter.com/M5oHf2YMXP\n— Marco Foster (@MarcoFoster_) August 12, 2025\n\nVance may have hoped for a relaxing vacation, but the trip brought attention to his odd relationship with the public both at home and internationally.

In my Jan. 26 article, “Nebraska went big for Trump—and that may kill its economy,” I warned that Nebraska’s reliance on federal programs and its immigrant labor force made it uniquely vulnerable under Trump’s policies.\n\nTurns out, I was right. A quarter later, Nebraska’s gross domestic product has shrunken more than 6% in early 2025, tying it with equally Trumpy Iowa for the worst drop in the nation. That statistic hit the headlines over a month ago, but what’s new is that Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins just had to face Nebraskans living through the fallout.\n\nFarmers’ grievances were exactly what you’d expect: Their farms were short-staffed thanks to immigration raids, tariffs raised costs and shrank export markets, and pricing controls made it harder to sell crops. \n\nThe state’s all-Republican congressional delegation had a familiar solution: more federal dollars to bail out the same pull-themselves-up-by-their-bootstraps crowd that spent years railing against “socialism.” As Sen. Deb Fischer explained, “There’s a lot of risk involved in agriculture. … You can’t control the weather. … That’s why these safety nets are so important.”\n\nRemember when “safety nets” were supposed to be a scourge?\n\nRep. Don Bacon, who will retire soon and give Democrats a prime pickup opportunity in the House, had his own fix: Expand government mandates for biofuels. \n\n“It’s the only way you’re going to move enough corn and soybeans,” he said. “Otherwise you’re going to have a depression.” \n\nIf there were a viable market case for ethanol without mandates, it would already exist.\n\nInstead, Trump’s policies may be steering Nebraska straight into a depression. Farm bankruptcies are spiking—259 filings in just the first quarter, surpassing all of last year, according to Ryan Loy, an agricultural economist at the University of Arkansas. He says the financial pressures farmers face now mirror those from 2018 and 2019.\n\nAnd who was president in 2018 and 2019? Exactly.\n\nImagine voting for economic devastation—and getting exactly that.\n\nBut in the middle of this wreckage lies a remarkable opening for Dan Osborn, a populist independent whose insurgent campaign nearly toppled a Republican Senate seat last year, even as Trump carried the state by more than 20 percentage points. Osborn overperformed Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris by 13 points in deep-red Nebraska, losing by just under 7 points. \n\nOsborn’s platform—support for small-business tax relief, union rights, legalized marijuana, protecting Social Security, strengthening public schools, securing the border, and guaranteeing the right to repair—has focused relentlessly on economic livelihood while sidestepping divisive social issues. (Yeah, yeah, the border stuff is part of the reason Nebraska is struggling, but you seemingly can’t win the state without it, at least not yet.)\n\nNow he’s running again—this time against Republican Sen. Pete Ricketts, one of the richest people in Congress. It’s the populist versus the privileged, the mechanic versus the moneyed elite.\n\nMaking breadbasket populism breathe again is no small thing. But if it can take root in Nebraska (and Iowa), it could radiate outward in future cycles. Let these states be the proving ground for a new prairie populism that can build a Senate majority on economic common ground.\n\nWhile Trump’s policies hammer Nebraska’s farms, Osborn’s rise offers something rare: a beacon of populist hope in a state teetering under economic collapse.","summary":"Every day brings fresh horrors from the Trump administration, and nothing comforts like the knowledge that Donald Trump’s supporters are paying the price.

Before losing a reelection bid last year, Brown had been the last Democrat to win statewide office in a state that has veered sharply to the right over the past decade. His entry instantly transforms the Ohio race from a distant dream to a plausible pickup opportunity for the party.\n\nIf most Democrats were ecstatic about Brown’s planned comeback bid, Amanda Litman was a bit less jazzed. To be sure, she’s a big fan of Brown, the gravelly-voiced populist who was once seen as a formidable presidential contender. (He never did run for the White House.) But Brown is now 72, and Litman, the founder of a group that encourages and trains first-time candidates, has been among the loudest voices calling for Democrats to ditch their gerontocracy once and for all. “In a year like this, if Sherrod Brown is really the best and only person that can make Ohio competitive, that’s who we should run,” Litman told me. But, she quickly added, “it is a damning indictment” of the Democratic Party in states such as Ohio that a just-defeated septuagenarian is its most viable choice.\n\nLitman has called for every Democrat over the age of 70 to retire at the end of their current term in office. A few have heeded that message: Earlier this year, Senators Dick Durbin of Illinois (80), Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire (78), Tina Smith of Minnesota (67), and Gary Peters of Michigan (66) all announced that they would not seek reelection next year. But in some of the nation’s biggest Senate races, Democrats are relying on an old strategy of recruiting—and then clearing the field for—long-serving party leaders with whom voters are already familiar.\n\nIn North Carolina, top Democrats aggressively lobbied former Governor Roy Cooper (68) to run for the Senate seat being vacated by the retiring Republican senator, Thom Tillis. And in Maine, the party is waiting to see if Governor Janet Mills (77) will challenge five-term Senator Susan Collins, the GOP’s most vulnerable incumbent, who is 72. If they run and win, Brown would be 80, Cooper would be 75, and Mills would be 85 at the end of their first Senate terms.\n\nDemocratic strategists and advocates I spoke with acknowledged the tension between the party’s broadly shared desire to elevate a new generation of leaders and its embrace of older candidates in these key Senate races. But they said the decision was easy in the states they most need to win next year. “The frustration of voters, donors, and younger elected officials is real,” Martha McKenna, a former political director of the Senate Democrats’ campaign arm, told me. But Cooper and Brown (and potentially Mills) “are brave patriots who have already shown they know how to run and win, which is thrilling to the Democratic grassroots base.” Any Democrats unhappy with their candidacies, McKenna added, “are defeatist bed wetters who would rather complain from the sidelines than get into the fight.”\n\nWinning the Senate is a long shot for Democrats in 2026. They would need to flip at least four Republican-held seats without losing any of their own, and the only blue state where a Senate race is up for grabs is Maine. But even a gain of two or three seats could put Democrats in position to take the majority in 2028, and they hope that a voter backlash to President Donald Trump’s second term, combined with the recruitment of strong candidates, could put states such as North Carolina, Ohio, Texas, Iowa, and Alaska in play next year. Republicans have also tried to woo popular governors to mount Senate campaigns, with less success: Governors Chris Sununu of New Hampshire (50) and Brian Kemp of Georgia (61) each passed on the opportunity.\n\nBrown lost to Bernie Moreno by three and a half points in a state that Trump carried by 11 points. He will likely start as an underdog against Senator Jon Husted, who was appointed by Governor Mike DeWine to fill the seat that J. D. Vance vacated when he became vice president. But even if Brown falls short, Democrats argue, his strength as a candidate could force Republicans to spend millions of dollars they would otherwise have directed elsewhere. No other Democrat in Ohio can make the same case.\n\nThe push for Democrats to get younger has been driven not only by the party’s panic over former President Joe Biden’s age and performance last summer, but by the more recent deaths of three House Democrats during the first five months of 2025. The activist David Hogg sparked an internal feud by declaring, soon after becoming the vice chair of the Democratic National Committee, that he would back primary challengers to some party incumbents in safe House seats.\n\nYounger Democrats did win key Senate seats last year in Arizona, New Jersey, and Michigan. And the party’s leading Senate contenders for 2026 in Texas, Michigan, New Hampshire, and Minnesota are in their 40s and early 50s. “We are in the fight of our lives, and that requires a truly multigenerational front,” Santiago Mayer, the founder of the youth-oriented progressive group Voters of Tomorrow, told me. “Of course we need young people running. We need young leaders who are vocal and visible around the country.” But Mayer said he had no problem with older Democrats such as Brown, Cooper, and (possibly) Mills leading the way in crucial races. “We need to be supporting the candidates who are proven winners,” he told me.\n\nNowhere are Democrats more desperate to win than Maine, where Collins’s resilience has both frustrated the party and scared off some of its rising stars. In 2020, Collins defeated a well-funded Democratic opponent by nearly nine points even as Biden carried the state by the same margin. Her approval ratings are even lower than they were at this time six years ago, and Democrats consider the state a must-win in the battle for the Senate. Yet hardly any Democrats have stepped up to take her on. (Jordan Wood, a onetime aide to former Representative Katie Porter of California, is the best-known declared candidate so far.) Representative Jared Golden, who holds a rural House district that Trump carried three times, decided to seek reelection rather than higher office. And several up-and-coming Democrats have opted to run for governor instead of challenging Collins.\n\nTo a large extent, everyone is waiting on Mills, who trounced her predecessor, Paul LePage, in his 2022 comeback bid and then drew national attention by telling Trump, “See you in court” during a confrontation at the White House earlier this year. The governor, however, is in no rush to make a decision and has evinced little excitement about becoming a freshman senator in her late 70s. “I mean, look, I wasn’t born with a burning desire to be in Washington, D.C.—any month of the year,” Mills told a local radio station last month even as she acknowledged that she was seriously considering a Senate campaign. One national Democratic strategist told me that the odds of Mills entering the race are about 50–50; another put the chances lower. The strategists showed little concern about Mills’s age, noting that she doesn’t appear any older than Collins (even though she is by five years). The issue may not resonate as much in Maine anyway, which has the oldest population of any state in the country.\n\nDemocrats have had mixed success relying on former governors to harness their cross-party popularity as state leaders in competitive Senate races. In 2020, then–Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper defeated GOP Senator Cory Gardner to help Democrats recapture the majority. And the four Democratic senators from Virginia and New Hampshire all previously served as their state’s governors. But in 2016, former Ohio Governor Ted Strickland lost by more than 20 points in his bid to oust a Republican senator. Two years later in Tennessee, former Governor Phil Bredesen met a similar fate.\n\nLitman argues that part of the Democrats’ problem is a fear of competitive primaries, which both parties try to avoid in Senate races because of their expense and the risk that the winner will emerge damaged for the general election. Some believe the lack of a presidential primary in 2024 hurt Kamala Harris’s chances against Trump. “That is how you keep Democratic voters engaged,” Litman said. “If we’ve learned anything from 2024, it’s that primaries are good.” She’s optimistic that as younger Democrats run and win at the local level, the party’s bench in red and purple states will get deeper, and the elections where its hopes hinge on aging former stars will become more rare. “It’s not like in one election cycle, everyone over the age of 70 is going to be thrown out,” she said. “This is the first big generational-change election for the Democratic Party. It’s not going to be the last.”","summary":"They’re old.","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/08/democrats-old-2026/683891/","image":"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/nJIKx6M72QeosBvdDfxhkeEM3TE=/0x0:2373x1335/720x405/media/img/mt/2025/08/2025_08_15_Older_Dems/original.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-16 12:00:00","author":"Russell Berman","authors":["Russell Berman"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.195},{"id":351752438,"title":"Palestinian Youth Movement Vows to Make Genocide Support Too Costly for Maersk","text":"After two years of continuous effort in research, agitation and direct action, the organizers of the Palestinian Youth Movement (PYM) celebrated a landmark organizing victory in late June. Their “Mask Off Maersk” campaign had sought to prove the complicity of the Danish freight-logistics titan A.P. Møller – Maersk A/S in the genocide in Gaza. \n\nMaersk, as it’s generally known, was found by PYM to be contributing to the ongoing crimes against humanity in Gaza by shipping arms transfers to the perpetrating Israeli military; these shipments included critical parts for the F-35 fighters that have been used to bomb Gaza’s civilian population. Aligning with the broad strategy of the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) movement, PYM organized to make a material difference by interrupting Israel’s still-unfolding campaign of ethnic cleansing, mass displacement and, incontrovertibly, genocide.\n\nPYM’s efforts ultimately applied sufficient pressure to Maersk to enact real, meaningful change: the company agreed to halt its work providing commercial shipping for enterprises that operate in illegal Israeli settlements. \n\nWith this strategy, pro-Palestine activists are seeking to exploit the strategic weak point that is the global logistics apparatus. As the Israeli military, having reduced its aerial bombing, continues to prosecute a genocide by other means — manipulating an aid system that is insufficient by design, creating distribution sites that are veritable death traps, and intentionally proliferating forced starvation and deprivation alongside active murder — the world’s most powerful nations and corporations continue to show up for duty as Israel’s reliable accomplices — and, of course, as eager profiteers. Some, though, are more susceptible to subversion than others. \n\nThe ability of the U.S. to blithely ignore international law, in service of abetting the supreme human crime of genocide, has thrown into relief the impunity enjoyed by the Global North in perpetrating even the most grievous legal and ethical violations. Despite the many measures taken to enact embargoes or other types of meaningful sanctions, leading global institutions have still proven unable to impose meaningful restraint on Israel and its main benefactor and arms dealer, our decaying superpower. Where the most vaunted chambers of international law have fallen short, it has been left to Palestinians themselves, and the vast and horrified publics worldwide that stand with them, to do all in their power to halt the genocidal machine.\n\nPoint of Intervention\n\nAnti-genocide activists are doing all they can to slow the ever-mounting death toll. PYM is a globally distributed network of (not exclusively) young activists, many Palestinian themselves; their efforts have earned them a considerable following and a leading role in the cause. PYM’s sense of urgency matches the ethical stakes: Their tone and moral seriousness, mocked by genocide deniers, has been so absent on cable television and the organs of the mainstream consensus.\n\nPYM organizer Aisha Nazar, a lead coordinator of the Mask Off Maersk project, characterized the group’s initial line of questioning in an interview with Truthout: “Where is the crack in the armor of genocide? Where can we be the wedge that forces it open?” \n\nTheir answer proved tactically savvy. It’s much easier, after all, to sway a shipping company to wind down a controversial part of its business, a mere fraction — as a logistics business would have many other clients — than to somehow induce a full-fledged arms corporation to dissolve itself. And by targeting logistics lines rather than the original sites of arms producers, noted Nazar, “instead of going after one arms manufacturer, with this target, we are going after them all.”\n\nInitially, PYM organizers pursued research — detailed analyses of cargo manifests, bills of lading and other logistics minutiae were required to prove conclusively that the F-35 fighter jet parts that Maersk ships were indeed destined for Israeli military use. They found evidence that left Maersk’s complicity beyond question. \n\nThe company, researchers determined, was also contracted to transport goods from companies based in Israeli settlements on Palestinian territory — colonial intrusions deemed illegal by the UN and even, at times, the U.S. The UN’s foremost human rights assembly, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), following Human Rights Council Resolution 31/36, maintains a database of commercial enterprises that are operating in these illegal settlements and are therefore complicit in infringements upon, per the UN, “the civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights of the Palestinian people.” Maersk, PYM researchers found, was contracting with settlement-based companies on the OHCHR list, some of which were also arms manufacturers.\n\nThe organizers released these findings publicly in a series of reports, compiling information that the company was not eager to publicize. PYM’s attention then turned to running direct actions, which included protests, sit-ins, and facility shutdowns at Maersk offices in New York, Copenhagen, Rotterdam, and elsewhere over the first half of 2025. As Nazar described, PYM members showed up at Maersk and generally “flooded the streets, confronted our politicians, disrupted their events [and] mobilized to city council meetings to pressure our governments and elected officials to sanction Israel and cut off arms.”\n\nNazar pointed out that Maersk’s globally distributed operation “allows us to employ a diverse set of tactics and demonstrates our movement’s strength by consolidating internationally.” By identifying and pressing into service a wide array of potential allies, their protests were able to bring together everyone from “environmental groups, to the labor sector, to migrant justice advocates,” as well as members of Parliament, lawyers, and more. They also employed tactics that were gleaned from a range of struggles like “city divestment, campus boycott[s],” and organized labor.\n\nMask Off Maersk and its allies mobilized a pointed intervention in March 2025, when, via an online campaign, they successfully urged Maersk shareholders to bring forth a resolution about its complicity. The company dismissed their resolution, but the secrecy was broken; at the meeting, Nazar said, “Maersk was forced to admit [to its shareholders] that it does indeed ship military cargo to Israel.”\n\nThose revelations led to legal challenges against Maersk from the Spanish government, a country that does have an embargo on Israel and has called for the rest of the European Union to follow suit. To avert inspection and investigation, the company elected to simply halt the use of the Spanish port of Algeciras by cargo ships en route to Israel. Then, in June, French dockworker unionists refused to work on Maersk’s Israel-bound ships, forcing the company to further reroute arms shipments; a similar labor protest action took place in Morocco. \n\nNaturally, these inconvenient workarounds are costly for the company. PYM worked to ensure that the cost of Maersk’s material support for genocide extended to their reputation, and their stock price. Clearly, Maersk corporate leaders must have rerun their cost/benefit analyses: in June, they acceded to a major demand, agreeing to halt commercial dealings with companies in Israeli settlements and promising that they would be “aligning [their] screening process with reference to UN standards.” \n\nVeteran investigative journalist and author of The Palestine Laboratory Antony Loewenstein told Truthout that PYM’s approach was worth replicating, as they’ve located a vulnerable node in the global war materiel network.\n\n“With every Western state refusing to impose any economic price on Israel for its endless genocide in Gaza,” Loewenstein remarked, “it’s up to civil society to rise up.” He raised a historical example: “American dockworkers were central in the global fight against South African apartheid, and such people can again be a vital cog in stopping the shipment of weapons and defense equipment to Israel.”\n\nNazar has also noted that PYM’s findings are “bolstering arms embargo laws and targeting the supply line to Zionism across Tunisia, Morocco, France, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Spain … A couple of volunteer researchers and youth organizers created diplomatic crises for one of the biggest shipping giants in the world; what this tells us is that an arms embargo is possible, and it is within our grasp.”\n\nPYM continues to center a “People’s Arms Embargo” as a key demand, hoping to build upon the Maersk win to further thwart the lines of industry and logistics that fuel the military machine of genocide. They are not alone: Palestine Action, the British “direct action network,” conducts direct subterfuge against military equipment and arms contractors like Elbit Systems (acts for which the group is now under severe censure and suppression), while, as Truthout reported, groups like Jews For Racial & Economic Justice and Port Workers and Communities for Palestine have also sought ways to interrupt the operations of companies like Atlas Air, ZIM, All-Ways Forwarding and others involved, to various degrees, in the flow of arms. \n\nInternational Impotence\n\nAnd yet why, we should ask, has it fallen to a small group of young activists to enforce the responsibilities of states under the 1948 Genocide Convention, not to mention numerous other strictures of international law? It’s not as if nation-states haven’t used legal and institutional means to register their dissent, even if that has not halted the unrestrained slaughter. In one notable example, South Africa has pursued a high-profile legal case charging Israel with genocide. And quite a few states, countries of the Global South in particular, have signaled substantial support for the patchwork of existing sanctions, embargoes, and arms limitations. Recently, at the Emergency Ministerial Conference on Palestine, convened by the Hague Group in Bogota, Colombia, in July, a dozen countries agreed to enforce arms transfer limitations. \n\nHowever, even the grander declarations of dissent have not always been matched by sustained material action aimed at slowing the unfolding of a genocide, and the rulings of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) have so far more closely resembled symbolic gestures than legal enforcement. Such measures are not without worth — but hopes must be tempered. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is already wanted for arrest by the International Criminal Court for egregious crimes against humanity, but it’s not yet clear that he will ever face consequences of any sort, and several countries have also expressed their lack of interest in holding him accountable.\n\nAs Jake Romm wrote for The Baffler, the international human rights model as it stands is structurally limited by the primacy it affords to the treaty-making nation-state: “States are ultimately able to decide whether they conform to [international laws] and the treaties on which they are based. All international human rights law thus … carries more or less persuasive power (but not coercive power) depending on the political moment.”\n\nBut the loftier ambitions of liberal internationalism tend to quickly run up against contrary prerogatives of capital and power. In this contest, it is clear which party is most often the victor. Between 2013 and 2023, Israel received more than 65 percent of its weaponry from the U.S., approximately 30 percent from Germany, and almost all of the remaining 5 percent from Italy. The genocide could not continue without U.S. largesse. This state of affairs, of course, leaves arms-exporting countries in the position of greatest leverage — though there are certainly other avenues that Israel’s powerful Western allies or other foreign critics could pursue. \n\nIn one telling example, a Dutch appeals court ruled in a landmark decision that the Netherlands must stop exporting F-35 parts to Israel. Yet, unfortunately, it seems compliance has been won merely in letter and not spirit; the Dutch state is now shipping the parts to the U.S., which subsequently sends them straight to the Israeli military. A wider ban on other arms exports was also rejected by Dutch courts.\n\nThe international armature of capitalist allies’ mutually reinforcing power, epitomized by the United States and its unflinching defense of its client state, have proved immune to even some of the harshest judgments of the liberal international order. In turn, U.S. unaccountability and flouting of the law reveal the fundamental hollowness of that order: a framework of justice based largely on rhetoric, bereft of economic considerations. This framework also unduly constrains the legal right to armed resistance to national entities alone. Likewise, the moral space of international human rights is invariably warped and compromised by contradictions that owe their existence to the messy allowances necessary to legitimize state-perpetrated traditional war.\n\nIt should be noted that the U.S. is equally cavalier about flouting its own standards. For one, the Leahy Law — which prevents arms transfers to countries engaged in gross human rights violations — clearly applies in this case. (The eponymous former Sen. Patrick Leahy himself agrees.) So, too, does the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, which states, “No assistance may be provided … to the government of any country which engages in a consistent pattern of gross violations of internationally recognized human rights[.]” \n\nGermany, for its role, has also faced internal calls for embargo and divestment from civil servants and academics, as well as legal challenges. Though it has at times slowed the passage of arms through its export review process in the course of legal review, Germany has been cagey at best with international courts. (Among other challenges, the nation of Nicaragua has charged Germany with Geneva Convention violations in the ICJ.) After a massive uptick, German weapons shipments have sunk back down “amid growing legal and political pressure domestically and internationally,” per Politico. Germany also recently announced a more widespread embargo — but there are signs its staunchly pro-Israel stance may be unchanged; as the BDS movement has charged, Germany has claimed to be imposing a comparable ban before, and may well continue to issue arms licenses via loopholes, contra public assurances.\n\nThe United States has done, basically, the complete opposite of anything like a ban, escalating massive continual deliveries — although the Biden administration would have liked you to think it was far more doubting and hesitant. Incredibly, former President Joe Biden and his diplomats pretended to be locked in debate with Netanyahu: a callow effort to manipulate the public’s perception in order to show far more U.S. reluctance (and moral backbone, it seems) than they ever really had. It was finally admitted by Biden staffers — after Kamala Harris lost — that at no point did the White House harbor the slightest intention of staying Israel’s hand. And naturally, the Trump administration has gleefully taken up that mantle, promising even more repugnant catastrophes extending to the wholesale ethnic cleansing and appropriation of Gaza.\n\nTo be clear, the many efforts of nations and organizations to impede the slaughter have been far from worthless; at minimum, they have measured the true degree of the world’s revulsion. But — with international law having run up against the immovable obstacle of the United States, which throws its weight around like a swaggering mob boss — it is everyday people who have broadened the boundaries of possibility and turned the world against a moral atrocity. It is the work of international organizers, and, most of all, Palestinians themselves — as journalists, or with their phones or their words — that have refused to let the world look away from this world-historical crime.\n\nAs Aisha Nazar said determinedly, “We know the truth. An arms embargo will not happen until the tidal wave of people power forces it to happen. We must enforce an arms embargo ourselves.”\n\nIt is safe to say that, when future generations reminisce on these events, the Palestinian people, PYM, and all those who saw this for what it was — those who full-throatedly condemned an utter evil and sought to put their bodies upon the gears and wheels of this odious machine, as Mario Savio famously put it — will be seen as figures of exemplary moral courage. Those who have posed gleefully with its top perpetrator, meanwhile, seem destined to be cast by history in a very different light.","summary":"Global activists aim to halt the Gaza genocide by interrupting the flow of arms to Israel.","url":"https://truthout.org/articles/palestinian-youth-movement-vows-to-make-genocide-support-too-costly-for-maersk/","image":"https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2219834710-scaled.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-16 11:30:52","author":"Tyler Walicek","authors":["Tyler Walicek"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.212},{"id":351590366,"title":"Gavin Newsom Breaks Through by Trolling Trump at His Own Meme Game","text":"California Governor Gavin Newsom is punching back at President Donald Trump — in memes and capital letters.Over the past few weeks, Newsom's official press office has turned its social media feed into a stream of all-caps threats, pop culture parodies and AI-edited meme content, aimed squarely at mocking Trump in style while countering Republican initiatives in substance. The tone is snarky, combative, and unmistakably modeled on the president's online persona.\"DONALD TRUMP, THE LOWEST POLLING PRESIDENT IN RECENT HISTORY, THIS IS YOUR SECOND-TO-LAST WARNING!!!\" read one of the governor's recent X posts. \"STAND DOWN NOW OR CALIFORNIA WILL COUNTER-STRIKE (LEGALLY!) TO DESTROY YOUR ILLEGAL CROOKED MAPS IN RED STATES.\"The missive was part of Newsom's response to a Trump-backed redistricting plan in Texas that could give Republicans up to five more seats in Congress. Newsom announced he would pursue a special election to redraw California's own congressional maps — an effort to offset potential GOP gains.At a press conference Thursday, Newsom defended both the redistricting plan — now set for a November vote his team is calling \"Liberation Day,\" a jab at Trump's use of the same phrase for his April tariff rollout — and his increasingly aggressive online presence.\"I don't know — I hope it's a wake-up call,\" he said. \"I'm following the president's example. If you've got issues with what I'm putting out, you should have concerns about what he's putting out as president... The deeper question is how we've allowed the normalization of his tweets and social posts over the last many years to go without similar scrutiny and notice.\"Newsom's memes have included calling Trump \"Donald 'TACO' Trump\" — shorthand for \"Trump Always Chickens Out\" — editing his rants into Star Wars villain voiceovers, comparing Trump adviser Stephen Miller to Lord Voldemort from Harry Potter, and mocking a post in which he criticized the Smithsonian.'Looking for a Fighter'Newsom's polling in early Democratic primary matchups has climbed sharply since February, in the aftermath of the worst wildfires to sweep through Los Angeles in decades.\"People thought his career was over. Now, he's in the top three in every poll,\" strategist Mike Madrid, a political consultant and co-founder of the Lincoln Project, an anti-Trump political action committee, told Newsweek.\"Democrats are looking for a fighter. It's not about ideology anymore. You can be centrist or progressive — what matters is that you stand up and hit back. The more aggressive Newsom gets, the more support he builds.\"A June Emerson College survey showed Newsom rising to 7 percent in the 2028 Democratic primary — up from 3 percent in March. A mid-July Echelon Insights poll placed him at 10 to 11 percent, just behind Kamala Harris and Pete Buttigieg. A UC Irvine poll in California showed his approval ratings rebounding as Trump's declined.\"Newsom, by standing up to Trump on redistricting, has landed himself in the spotlight in the Democrat presidential primary,\" said Republican strategist Carter Wrenn. \"That's not decisive, but it does give him a boost.\"Online and On OffenseWhile Democrats have struggled to match the GOP's meme machine, Newsom's team is adopting his own tactics: trolling, parody, and cultural references designed to go viral and shift the narrative in Democrats' favor.That strategy was on display when Fox News asked for comment after Newsom said Texas Governor Greg Abbott \"rolled over for Trump.\" Abbott uses a wheelchair, and the question drew a sharp, unapologetic response.\"No. But how woke of you to ask! I'm sorry Greg's feelings were hurt. Poor guy — we hope he recovers,\" said Izzy Gardon, Newsom's deputy communications director, in a statement that circulated widely online.The comment sparked outrage from conservatives but drew praise from liberal influencers. \"Still laughing at this statement from Newsom's team to Fox,\" posted the popular left-wing account MeidasTouch. \"He is absolutely ruthless & giving Republicans every ounce of their own medicine,\" wrote Democratic strategist Victor Shi.Matt Bennett, co-founder of the center-left think tank Third Way, told Newsweek the approach taps into something deeper: \"His online taunting of the president is well-crafted and funny, and it's become a source of real catharsis for Democrats who seethe all day at Trump's outrages,\" Bennett said.\"But more than that, Newsom is one of the few Democrats who's figured out how to gain actual leverage to counterattack — not just posture, but act.\"Meme Wars Go Both WaysTrump's own digital tactics are well known. His White House social media team regularly posts AI-edited images — Trump as a lightsaber-wielding Jedi, or in papal robes with the caption \"Pope Trump.\" His team has used memes to frame hardline policies, like a stylized video showing shackled immigrants being deported, as part of what analysts call a \"shock-and-spectacle\" communications model.\"Trump doesn't just provoke — he floods the zone with images and slogans until his narrative becomes the only one in the room,\" Alex Patton, a former GOP strategist, told Newsweek.But for Madrid, Newsom's approach has the potential to resonate with Democratic voters because this moment isn't about pushing a policy agenda — it's about breaking through in the online attention wars. He noted that Democrats across the spectrum, from Arizona's Ruben Gallego, a centrist, to New York's Zohran Mamdani, a socialist, have thrived by taking their own aggressive stances.\"Newsom is disrupting that model, one meme at a time. He's showing Democrats they don't have to play defense on social media — they can troll back and shape the conversation before it gets away.\"Still, some observers warn that viral appeal doesn't always translate into broad support.\"His aggressive social media speaks to and energizes a small group of people who spend a lot of time online,\" said Democratic strategist Doug Gordon. \"But social media is not real life, and most voters will never see it. What Democratic primary voters really want are leaders who can effectively push back against the authoritarian moves we are seeing from the Trump Administration.\"Gordon added that the redistricting plan will be Newsom's real test. \"If he can muscle it through before 2026, that will certainly help him if he chooses to run in 2028.\"","summary":"California Governor Gavin Newsom is punching back at Donald Trump — in memes and capital letters.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/gavin-newsom-breaks-through-trolling-trump-his-own-meme-game-2114281","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2703581/gavin-newsom-meme.jpg?w=1600&h=900&l=50&t=54&q=88&f=73ad0c0e727ff20d5fae15ca4730eb17","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-16 10:00:02","author":"Jesus Mesa","authors":["Jesus Mesa"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.332},{"id":351595572,"title":"Walters: Governor, lawmakers short on options to reduce state’s soaring electricity bills","text":"If and when Gavin Newsom launches a campaign for president, economic and social conditions in the California he’s governed for two terms will be in the spotlight.\n\nWhile Newsom brags incessantly about the state and its achievements, its chronic problems, such as a high level of homelessness, are obvious to anyone. Political media and his rivals will focus on them with laser-like intensity.\n\nGiven the dynamics of last year’s presidential contest, in which worries about rising costs of living played a role in Californian Kamala Harris’s loss to Donald Trump, California’s very high costs for housing and other fundamental living needs, would be fodder for attacks on Newsom in 2028.\n\nNewsom has been trying to insulate himself, as much as possible, from such criticism. For example, he’s signed legislation aimed at increasing housing production and ordered his administration to crackdown on cities that impede construction.\n\nLast October, just a few days before Harris lost, Newsom ordered California’s Public Utilities Commission, Air Resources Board and state Energy Commission to generate ideas on how high costs of energy, particularly electricity, could be mitigated.\n\n“We’re taking action to address rising electricity costs and save consumers money on their bills,” Newsom said at the time. “California is proving that we can address affordability concerns as we continue our world-leading efforts to combat the climate crisis.”\n\nCalifornia’s residential and commercial electricity rates are the highest in the nation’s lower 48 states, according to a monthly compilation by the California Center for Jobs & the Economy, an adjunct to the California Business Roundtable. Californians’ actual power bills are the ninth-highest due to the state’s relatively mild climate, the report found.\n\nPower bills hit low-income families especially hard, especially those living in inland communities, where summer temperatures easily pass 100 degrees, requiring extensive use of air conditioning. This week, a report from the Public Policy Institute of California confirmed that observation.\n\n“Rising household electricity costs in California over the past decade have largely outpaced rising incomes for low- and middle-income families,” wrote PPIC authors Tess Thorman, Patricia Malagon and Paulette Cha. “Just before the pandemic, income was beginning to catch up with costs for low-income households, but the high cost burden of electricity bills jumped between 2019 and 2021 — for everyone.\n\n“Geography also plays an important role, highlighted in the California Public Utilities Commission’s efforts to monitor the affordability of utility bills. Electricity is least affordable to households in hotter zones — specifically in parts of the Inland Empire, San Joaquin Valley, and the state’s northern region.”\n\nThe CPUC and the energy commission responded to Newsom’s order in February but didn’t offer much in the way of effective steps to reduce utility bills. The CPUC noted that there are existing programs to help low-income families cope with power bills, financed mostly from utilities’ overall revenues, and suggested that they could be increased with non-ratepayer money, such as budget appropriations.\n\nIt also decried the fact that homeowners who install solar panels on their roofs tend to have high incomes but don’t contribute much to support the electrical grid — an issue that’s kicked around the Capitol for years. This year, legislation that would have hit solar panel owners in the wallet, Assembly Bill 942, was watered down to little more than a token after a fierce lobbying battle.\n\nThe energy commission’s report on power costs was even thinner gruel, mostly patting itself on the back for adopting standards for appliances and other power-using devices that reduced their demands.\n\nThe bottom line is that Californians’ power costs are very high, could go even higher as utilities are pressed to reduce the danger of power lines causing wildfires, and there’s precious little Newsom and legislators can do about it, since they face chronic budget deficits.\n\nDan Walters is a CalMatters columnist.","summary":"California power costs are very high, and there’s precious little Newsom and legislators can do about it amid chronic budget deficits.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/08/16/walters-governor-lawmakers-short-on-options-to-reduce-states-soaring-electricity-bills/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/SJM-Z-OPED-WALTERS-0817.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-16 09:45:34","author":"Dan Walters","authors":["Dan Walters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.076},{"id":351577808,"title":"Trump’s New Pick for a Key Economic Role Really Does Not Inspire Confidence","text":"Sign up for the Surge, the newsletter that covers most important political nonsense of the week, delivered to your inbox every Saturday.\n\nHello!

I’m Ben Mathis-Lilley, still filling in for Jim Newell; Jim has taken the summer off to join one of those trendy goofball baseball teams, for whom he serves as a situational right-handed relief pitcher who falls into a pile of horse manure at least once a game. And you think your dry-cleaning bills are bad!\n\nThis week, a man named “Big Balls” triggered a military invasion, the government explained somewhat unpersuasively why it has decided not to cure cancer, and Chuck Schumer racked up another big-time Chuck Schumer dub. (Chuck Schumer stays winning!) But first, let’s talk about the random guy from C-list right-wing media who looks like a member of Korn and has been assigned to ruin the world economy.\n\nE.J. Antoni\n\nThe monthly unemployment data announcement will now be referred to as “funemployment happy time” and it will be hosted by an animatronic Joseph Goebbels.\n\nDonald Trump had a problem: The bill for the enormous tariffs he has unilaterally imposed on scores of foreign countries was starting to come due in the form of higher prices for consumers and rising unemployment. And after thinking on it for a few minutes, the irrepressible Mr. Trump landed on a solution: He would fire the person in charge of economic data (i.e., the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics) and replace her with someone who was willing to say every month that things are going great regardless of what the numbers show. That person, the president announced this week, should be E.J. Antoni, a 37-year-old who only earned his Ph.D. five years ago and has no professional credentials to speak of but does appear frequently on MAGA media king Steve Bannon’s podcast to praise the president. (It’s neither here nor there, but he also has the angular widow’s peak and goatee of a ’90s rap-rock bassist.)\n\nAntoni’s most notable recent economic proposal, it turns out, was to suspend the issuance of monthly employment reports, something that even Trump-friendly conservative economists like Stephen Moore identified as a bad idea that would make it difficult for businesses and banks to do a little something called “planning for the future.” Meanwhile, photos surfaced of Antoni giving previous interviews in front of a big painting of a Nazi battleship. (“The markets” did not ultimately fare that well under the National Socialists, for the record, with the Allied air forces’ destruction of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange putting a point on things in 1944.) His position requires Senate confirmation, which is usually pretty easy to obtain these days. Buckle up!\n\nVladimir Putin\n\nA high-stakes game of trying to distract the American president with a swinging pocket watch.\n\nLike any good diplomat, President Trump changes his opinion on who he wants to win the Ukraine–Russia war based on which country’s head of state he perceives as a greater threat to his ego at any given moment. At this moment, Vladimir Putin and Trump are on the outs because Trump, who wants to get credit for negotiating a peace settlement, has gradually realized that Putin has been playing him for a chump to kill time while he attempts to conquer as much of Ukraine as possible. Thus, ahead of Friday’s summit with the Russian leader in Alaska, Trump was telling whoever would listen that he wanted both sides in the conflict to agree to an immediate ceasefire that would not require the ceding of any Ukrainian territory, and he was backing up that position with threats to impose further sanctions on Russia that other foreign leaders, at least, seemed to be taking seriously. Trump is famous, though, for agreeing fully with the last person he talked to; Putin once mesmerized him so thoroughly at a one-on-one meeting that Trump took Russia’s side against the United States itself at the ensuing press conference. As of the time we had to wrap this newsletter, Trump had greeted Putin by clapping for him as he disembarked his airplane, so make of that portent what you will.\n\nThe Franz Ferdinand of our time.\n\nRemember Edward “Big Balls” Coristine? He’s a very young Trump administration staffer, initially brought on by Elon Musk’s DOGE operation, who appeared to follow several racist and super-duper antisemitic Twitter/X accounts and was previously active in an online hacker community known for harassment, extortion, and doxing. (He has not been accused of any crime.) Over a week ago, Coristine was injured in what he says was an altercation resulting from an alleged 3 a.m. carjacking attempt, an incident that President Trump is now citing as one of the main reasons for ordering the deployment of the National Guard and hundreds of federal law enforcement officers to the nation’s capital. This, the White House says, will eliminate street crime and also, somehow, homelessness. We’ll see! (It won’t.) (Also, crime in Washington recently hit a 30-year-low and is not particularly concentrated in the public spaces that Trump claims are a problem.)\n\nChuck Schumer\n\nLet’s turn up! Let’s go!\n\nThe news for Democrats these days is usually not a lot of fun. It’s hard to be in the minority in Congress when the majority enforces total loyalty to the president and the Supreme Court is basically allowed to take bribes from the president’s top donors. But the good news this week for the donkeys was twofold. One, they proved they still know how to throw a hell of a top-dollar fundraising party, assembling their most well-heeled supporters at a luxury hotel in California wine country for a discussion of how to communicate with blue-collar working-class voters. (I am not making that part up; they really did hold their seminar on how to talk to regular people at a luxury wine resort.) Two, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer secured a commitment from former Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, someone who really does have a history of winning working-class votes, to run for the chamber again in 2026. Brown lost a reelection race in 2024 to Sen. Bernie Moreno, but this time he’ll be competing for the state’s other seat, which J.D. Vance vacated to take the vice presidency. It’s currently held by a relatively low-profile state party figure named Jon Husted; two years ago, Brown finished 2.5 percentage points ahead of Kamala Harris, so the hope is that in a better environment for Democrats, he’ll be able to make the flip. If he can do that, and former Gov. Roy Cooper—whose entry into North Carolina’s Senate contest was another recruiting “win” for Dems—can hold on to his own early lead, it would go a long way toward helping secure control of the chamber.\n\nJay Bhattacharya\n\nI believe this is what is known in the scientific community as “some real circular-logic-ass bullshit.”\n\nLast week, the Department of Health and Human Services canceled hundreds of millions of dollars of research into so-called mRNA vaccines. These vaccines use RNA genetic-coding molecules to trigger the human body to manufacture specific types of proteins found in viruses like COVID-19; the body then generates antibodies against those proteins, which helps make for a more effective immune response if and when it encounters the actual virus in question. In his announcement of the policy, HHS secretary and vaccine conspiracy theorist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. wrote that mRNA immunology is not “safe” or “effective,” which was not a claim that any actual medical specialists agreed with. (The approach, researchers say, even has the potential to protect against diseases like HIV and cancer.) In response, National Institutes of Health Director Jay Bhattacharya, who is a doctor, wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post published Tuesday in which he called mRNA vaccines an “elegant” and “promising” technology, described the COVID mRNA vaccine as the triumphant fruit of a “very successful” development process, and admitted that it has not caused “mass harm.” The termination of funding for mRNA development, he explained, is actually only necessary because the approach has not earned “public trust”—something for which he blames the Biden administration rather than, you know, the years that both he and his boss have spent telling people that vaccines are dangerous and don’t work. There’s no shame with some of these people.\n\nRedistricting ad absurdum.\n\nThere is a big fight over “redistricting” going on in politics right now, and frankly, the Surge finds it a bit tedious and dispiriting. First Texas decided to redraw its districts to make them more Republican, then California Gov. Gavin Newsom said he would try to retaliate by making his state’s districts more Democratic, and now a bunch of other states might get involved too. It’s all very obviously not how the Constitution says things are supposed to work, but since it would require mutual deescalation and compromise to get resolved, it’s just going to continue getting worse and worse forever. One thing the Surge did get a kick out of, though, was the very colorful and soon-to-be-very-divorced Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton’s attempt to insert himself into the situation. (Paxton, whose Wikipedia page features a “legal issues” section of considerable length, is trying to earn Trump’s endorsement in a primary challenge against GOP Texas Sen. John Cornyn.) Having noticed that high-profile former Rep. Beto O’Rourke was raising money for Democratic Texas legislators who’ve fled the state in a procedural effort to forestall the Republican-friendly gerrymander, Paxton found a friendly judge to enjoin O’Rourke’s efforts. Now he’s claiming, on the basis of an expansive interpretation of some of O’Rourke’s subsequent comments, that O’Rourke is violating the injunction and needs to be put in jail indefinitely. Sure, why not? Let’s put Beto O’Rourke in jail for being a Democrat. Let’s steal the Declaration of Independence. Let’s start a subsistence farm in rural Canada and never check the news again!\n\nLaura Loomer\n\nThe memory-erasing thing from Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, did they ever make that in real life?\n\nLaura Loomer is a self-described white nationalist and online personality who once had her accounts deactivated by both Uber and Lyft for complaining that they allow Muslims to work as rideshare drivers. She is also, by virtue of having maintained staunch support for Donald Trump even after Jan. 6, one of the most influential people in the United States.

According to AP VoteCast, voters ages 18 to 29 supported then Vice President Kamala Harris over Trump by just 51 percent to 47 percent. In 2020, Joe Biden carried the same age group by a much wider margin, winning 61 percent to Trump's 36 percent.What To KnowTrump's standing with Gen Z voters has improved over the past month, with notable gains on the economy, immigration, and inflation, alongside modest increases in trust and confidence in his leadership, according to the polling.The August YouGov/Economist poll surveyed 1,635 adults and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percent. The July poll surveyed 1,680 adults and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 percent.On the economy, approval rose from 30 percent in July to 36 percent in August, while disapproval fell from 64 percent to 54 percent. Meanwhile, approval of his handling of inflation jumped from 23 percent to 31 percent, with disapproval dropping from 72 percent to 60 percent.Inflation rose to 2.7 percent year-on-year in June, the highest reading since February, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).Gen Z's view of economic trends also improved. In July, 12 percent said the economy was getting better, 27 percent said it was the same, and 58 percent saw it getting worse. By August, \"better\" climbed to 18 percent, \"same\" dipped slightly to 25 percent, and \"worse\" fell to 51 percent.But Trump's approval rating on the economy is still substantially lower than it was in January, when his net approval among Gen Z stood at +18 points.Job growth slowed sharply in July, with just 73,000 new jobs added, far lower than expected. After last month's jobs report was published, Trump fired BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer. In a post, Trump accused McEntarfer—without offering evidence—of rigging the numbers to harm his administration. But that move by Trump was not popular among Gen Z voters, with only 13 percent saying the decision was justified—50 percent said they were not sure.Despite that, the latest poll shows small but measurable gains in perceptions of Trump's character and leadership. In August, 22 percent described him as honest, up from 20 percent in July, while the share saying he is not honest fell from 67 percent to 57 percent.But overall, Trump's honesty rating has fallen to its lowest point since he reentered the White House, with just 31 percent of Americans viewing Trump as trustworthy as he has recently faced mounting criticism for his handling of the Jeffrey Epstein investigation.Billionaire Elon Musk has urged Trump to \"just release the files as promised,\" while author Michael Wolff has speculated that Trump may be seeking major distractions to shift attention away from the Epstein fallout. Victims and advocacy groups remain adamant that all records be made public, arguing that the current handling of the case \"smacks of a cover-up.\"Public discontent is also reflected in the polls. On the Jeffrey Epstein case, only 13 percent of Gen Z voters approve of Trump's handling, while 69 percent disapprove. And 44 percent believe he knew \"a lot\" of Epstein's crimes before investigations began—and 32 percent think he knew \"some.\" Trump has said that he had no knowledge of, or involvement, in Epstein's crimes.What Happens NextThe Republican-led House Oversight Committee subpoenaed the DOJ for its files on Epstein, with a deadline of August 19 to hand them over, suggesting the issue isn't going away for the president anytime soon.And Trump's new nominee to run the BLS hinted at suspending the monthly release of jobs data. August's numbers are due to be published in the first week of September.","summary":"Trump's standing with Gen Z voters has improved over the past month.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-approval-rating-polls-gen-z-2113481","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2702402/trump.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=de005b9d8a74db53dc3ae6e2d5d47b46","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-16 09:00:01","author":"Martha McHardy","authors":["Martha McHardy"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.283},{"id":351624160,"title":"Maher: Dems Like AOC, Mamdani, Warren Are Afraid to Come on My Show","text":"On Friday’s broadcast of HBO’s “Real Time,” host Bill Maher stated that he would like to have Rep.

Even late-breaking investigations and speculation surrounding the suicide of President Trump's late friend Jeffrey Epstein have had to compete with a ferocious partisan war within some of the states over redistricting.\n\nConsider Texas, where Republicans in the state Legislature are attempting, at Trump's urging, to redraw congressional districts in order to flip five more districts to Republican majorities. Democratic legislators have fled the state to deny the Legislature a quorum, in hopes of preventing Republicans from carrying out their plan.\n\nSome have taken refuge in Illinois, leading Texas Republicans to call for their arrest by the FBI. Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker has vowed to protect them.\n\n\"Donald Trump is trying to steal five seats from the people – frankly, of the country, not just the people of Texas – and disenfranchise people,\" Pritzker said on \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.\" \"We're talking about violating the Voting Rights Act and the Constitution.\"\n\nPritzker also declined to turn away from the possibility of a mid-decade congressional remap in his own state. He told Colbert: \"It's possible. I've said everything is on the table. We've gotta fight fire with fire.\"\n\nAre we starting to see the hardball attitude that many frustrated Democrats have been urging their national party to adopt?\n\nStill smarting from the debacle of Joe Biden's 2024 candidacy and the subsequent defeat of the Kamala Harris/Tim Walz ticket, Dems appear increasingly ready to face a real threat to their ability to regain power in 2026 and beyond.\n\nFor their part, Republicans are not trying to hide their determination to gerrymander their way out of a midterm backlash in November 2026. Vice President Vance visited Indiana to urge lawmakers to redraw their congressional map.\n\nI find it to be no small irony that these battle lines are forming on the 60th anniversary of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. Some of us are old enough to remember the feeling that a new page in American history had been turned when that law was enacted. We believed that it would finally end the denial and dilution of Black voting power.\n\nThat dream, once won, now must be defended once again. Frankly, it's been a never-ending chore. The last time House Democrats held the majority, they introduced a sweeping package of good-government reforms, including a centerpiece legislation to end partisan gerrymandering.\n\n\"The people should choose their politicians,\" then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in 2021 before the House passed the For the People Act, which would later die in the Senate. \"Politicians should not be choosing their voters.\"\n\nOf course, choosing their voters is precisely what Trump and Republican legislatures intend to do. Trump's team has pushed Republicans to redraw maps \"wherever redistricting is an option.\"\n\nDemocrats can't afford to respond with anything less. Indeed, some Democrats, such as California Gov. Gavin Newsom, are switching from their past lofty positions in favor of bipartisan redistricting commissions to embracing the idea of fighting fire with fire.\n\nPelosi, who remains a member of the U.S. House, said that while Democrats favor nationwide independent commissions to draw congressional district maps, they \"cannot and will not unilaterally disarm.\"\n\nRecent polling trends show eroding support for Trump's actions and policies, which can be aptly summed up as \"reverse Robin Hood\" with a police-state sideshow. This is especially the case among independents but is noticeable even among Republicans.\n\nA big opportunity is opening for challengers who can show voters sanity, humanity and the backbone to stand up to the schoolyard bully in the Oval Office. And Democrats have shown before that they can rise from the slough of despond to win an electoral mandate.\n\nThis normally silly season has turned sinister, and the stakes to Democrats are existential. Their first step in winning back voters is showing they're willing to fight.\n\nTribune Content Agency","summary":"Gee, what's happened to the \"silly season\" of U.S. politics?That's what many of us in the daily journalism trade used to call the periods, usually in late summer or near holidays, when news media put an unusually intense focus on…","url":"https://buffalonews.com/article_e4c2c9d8-f84d-5300-a3cd-993395456ad9.html","image":"https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/buffalonews.com/content/tncms/custom/image/661b9d20-c537-11ea-a16f-1fed0e01c517.jpg?resize=600%2C315","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-16 07:18:09","author":"Blox Content Management","authors":["Blox Content Management"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.175},{"id":351647476,"title":"‘I’m the one to beat’: is Taylor Swift’s Showgirl era set to take her to even greater heights?","text":"Taylor Swift’s podcast interview with her American football player boyfriend, Travis Kelce, this week yielded plenty of tidbits for fans. Across two hours of loose chat on New Heights, the show Kelce helms with his brother Jason – also a football player – Swift revealed she was obsessed with sourdough and lurked on baking blogs. The couple spent the summer with her family, caring for her 73-year-old father, Scott, after he had a quintuple heart bypass. She gave Kelce a lesson on Hamlet and taught him how to avoid internalising speculation about their two-year relationship. You could call them the tentpoles of the 35-year-old pop star’s brand: literary passions and professional self-awareness.\n\nOne surprising revelation came near the end. Until the record-breaking 149-date Eras tour that Swift mounted from 2023-24, she said she had “never allowed myself to say: ‘You’ve arrived. You’ve made it.’” Being the only artist to win the Grammy for album of the year four times hadn’t done it; not the records broken, the acclaimed shifts from country to mainstream pop to indie. Nor her staggeringly successful campaign to re-record her first six albums to devalue their master recordings, sold by her first record label to an industry nemesis, and then on to a private equity company. “But the Eras tour,” she said, “I was like, this is nothing like what I’ve experienced before. It was so much better than anything else.”\n\nEras leapfrogged becoming the first billion-dollar tour to become the first $2bn tour. That would be plenty of cause for celebration and a good long rest. So would, as Swift announced in May, finally owning the rights to those first six albums, having successfully negotiated to buy the asset outright. (It ended her re-recording project: her 2006 debut is done and waiting, and she barely started 2017’s Reputation.) Her legacy isn’t just culturally assured, but materially secure. But Swift evidently isn’t ready to let that feeling of having “made it” go. She appeared on New Heights to announce her 12th album, The Life of a Showgirl, arriving just 18 months after its predecessor and 10 months after Eras concluded: she is apparently congenitally incapable of rest, with a lot to process.\n\nThe public will – correctly – have long assumed that Swift has well and truly made it like no one ever has. But the record’s promised contents, intentions and release strategy are set to make Swift – and Kelce alongside her – hysterically famous at a new level, capitalising on and shifting industry norms in a way that may leave her detractors researching bunkers in which to hide from it all.\n\nSwift’s new album does not arrive until 3 October, but this week’s edition of the industry newsletter Record of the Day led with a tongue-in-cheek congratulations to “everyone at EMI and Taylor Swift on her latest No 1 album The Life of a Showgirl”. Supernova success is a foregone conclusion: last year’s introspective The Tortured Poets Department (TTPD) was the first album to pass a billion streams in its first week, reaching 1.76bn.\n\nSwift is beloved on an unfathomable scale. She is one of the last monocultural pop stars. You suspect she could have toured Eras for five years and still sold out every night. Her devout Swifties, casual pop fans and curious rubberneckers will likely propel Showgirl past TTPD’s record, such is the critical mass behind her, no matter what it sounds like. Her reign, says Annie Zaleski, the author of Taylor Swift: The Stories Behind the Songs, is unprecedented because “she’s so consistent and continuing to evolve”.\n\nBut on the podcast, Swift sounded surprisingly aware of the limitations of TTPD – too wordy, too long, too downbeat – and keen to course-correct. That project, she said, had been about “catharsis”, “mess” and “rawness” following an apparently humiliating fling with the 1975’s Matty Healy. TTPD comprised 16 songs; and on release day, Swift dropped a previously unannounced 15-track sister album, The Anthology. For Showgirl, she said she craved “focus and discipline”: just 12 songs going behind the scenes of her Eras life, with “melodies that were so infectious you’re almost angry”. She made a surprising admission about her recent quality control: “Keeping the bar really high is something I’ve been wanting to do for a very long time.”\n\nSwift recorded Showgirl with the Swedish co-producers Max Martin and Shellback in Stockholm around Eras’ spring 2024 European run. The second of her three dates in the Swedish capital was the 89th date of the Eras tour: she named her fifth album, partly produced by the Swedes, 1989 after her birth year. Given the endless number games she plays, sowing numerology clues for fans setting up her future movements, you can assume the scheduling was no accident.\n\nMartin and Shellback co-produced Red (2012), 1989 (2014) and Reputation (2017), homes to her biggest pure-pop smashes, among them Style, 22, and Blank Space. Her first subsequent album without them, 2019’s playful Lover, was regarded as ending that imperial period. Since then, Swift’s music has grown more muted and experimental, often in collaboration with the producers Jack Antonoff and the National’s Aaron Dessner, as if she were trying to carve out a sustainable future for a 30-something songwriter: 2020’s folksy Folklore and Evermore, the dusky pop of 2022’s Midnights, TTPD. They spawned no comparable radio hits; her biggest in recent years is Lover’s Cruel Summer, never officially released as a single but adopted as a fan favourite.\n\nSwift now seems to be framing those records as a phase – her art school years. The Showgirl era seems to be an attempt to recapture the kind of musical ubiquity where little kids yell your lyrics at birthday parties, as they did with 2014’s Shake It Off and now do with songs such as Chappell Roan’s Hot to Go! “My business is making music and taking care of my fans and I have ways of monitoring what they want from me and how best to entertain them, which is my job,” she told the Kelces. Eras was divided into segments reflecting each of her albums (except her 2006 debut): imagine it as a 149-night focus group.\n\nSwift’s monitoring also cannot have failed to note that her brand of hermetically sealed, grown-up pop has been ceding ground to Roan, Sabrina Carpenter and Charli xcx, who have seized culture’s centre with less inhibited and far rowdier hits than the exacting Swift has ever made. Or perhaps ever could: one insurmountable difference is that Roan and xcx are unlikely to ever monitor fan desire or cater to it. And Martin, despite being second only to John Lennon and Paul McCartney for having the most US No 1 singles, has waned as a hitmaker. “I don’t think she can get ahead of those artists because she’s such a millennial pop star,” said a publicist for comparably superstar acts who asked to remain nameless. “She can’t create trends like those younger artists because they have a lot less to lose.”\n\nThere is a sense that Swift is catching up: that she’s clocked criticisms, read the room. She released 19 physical variants for TTPD, and was accused of exploiting fans and damaging the environment with excess vinyl production, a practice Billie Eilish has called “wasteful”. Showgirl appears to have a fairly industry-standard four. She is also competing with herself: if there is a tour, says the music business expert Eamonn Forde, it will have to take a significantly different form to Eras – residency-style, perhaps Vegas or in a bespoke venue, as recently done by Adele – to avoid unfavourable comparisons to the biggest tour of all time.\n\nSwift drew mass media coverage for her appearances at Kelce’s games with the Kansas City Chiefs, prompting some aggrieved football fans to boo whenever she appeared on the jumbotron. In a trailer for her episode of New Heights, traditionally a sports show, Swift joked: “I think we all know that if there’s one thing that male sports fans want to see in their spaces and on their screens, it’s more of me.” Unluckily for them, the brand-building between Kelce and Swift looks set to make their association unavoidable.\n\nNew Heights is part of their lore: after Kelce tried and failed to land a meeting with Swift after an Eras show, he told listeners he wanted to meet her. Intrigued, she took him up on it. The synchronicity began. It can be no mistake that Kelce’s cover of GQ magazine landed the same week as Swift’s podcast. Meanwhile, Swift rarely gives interviews: New Heights offers a mutually beneficial space where the couple wield full control, albeit with a soft touch: giving cute disclosures, such as his love of wild otters or her running to tell him about getting her masters back when he was gaming with the boys. The moment capitalised on the prevailing trend for A-listers to reserve their media engagements for fairly fannish video podcasts, making traditional journalists fear for their jobs as they dutifully write up any news lines.\n\nPremiering Wednesday night in the US, the episode livestream crashed; within 24 hours it had 13m YouTube views, not including other podcast platform stats. The value to advertisers is huge, especially in anticipation of future Swift revelations. And Kelce, a comparatively old player at 35, is rumoured to be retiring after the coming season – his 13th year, Swift’s lucky number – so will be power-brokering his post-game career. He admitted to GQ he had literally taken his eye off the ball, with underwhelming stats in his past two seasons, because he was chasing other opportunities. “It’s his Steven Bartlett, Diary of a CEO move,” said the publicist. “It’s future-proofing their lives. He can’t be a football player for ever; she can’t be a pop star for ever. It makes them a unit – look at how it worked for the Beckhams.”\n\nAfter a backlash around 2015-16 resulting from her beef with Kanye West and Kim Kardashian, Swift managed to convincingly reboot her brand: a dedicated, literary songwriter who fights for artists’ rights. To onlookers outside the NFL, Kelce’s is ripe for shaping from two years of dating Swift. The couple are clearly conscious of this: Kelce told GQ he had “become way more strategic in understanding what I am portraying to people”, something you may imagine constitutes pillow talk in a business-minded household. “No man has ever said those words,” said the publicist.\n\nKelce’s image is openhearted romantic. Notably, he is Swift’s first significant boyfriend to seem undaunted by her celebrity – her previous six-year relationship with the British actor Joe Alwyn took place almost entirely in private. A sweet aspect of the New Heights episode was two beefy jocks being so excited by and supportive of a girly pop star. Swift joked of his public entreaty to date her that “this is sort of what I’ve been writing songs about wanting to happen to me since I was a teenager”. The couple riffed on memes questioning Kelce’s intelligence – “it’s so hot when she says big words,” he said when Swift called Folklore “esoteric” – which is in itself very smart: positioning Kelce as lovable and non-threatening.\n\nSwift said she immediately warmed to him for not being “judgmental”, describing him as “a vibe booster in everyone’s life … like a human exclamation point”. The implication is that he could pep up your sentences if you let him into your heart. Kelce’s post-football business is being everyone’s boyfriend, not just Swift’s. His pesky family ties to Maga Trumpists won’t hurt him in the US; if Swift, who endorsed Kamala Harris in the last election, were to be questioned about this, “her argument can be that she’s the leftwing voice in these rooms”, the publicist said.\n\nWin-win. Although Swift seemed keen to establish some distance from the voluble TTPD era, a song from The Anthology about her and Kelce’s relationship seems to outline her present mindset. “I’m making a comeback to where I belong,” she sings on The Alchemy. “Ditch the clowns, get the crown / Baby, I’m the one to beat … These blokes warm the benches / We’ve been on a winning streak.”\n\nThat streak is assured: next year marks the 20th anniversary of Swift’s self-titled debut, and she will inevitably release the re-recording to mark the occasion. Showgirl’s successor will be her 13th album, a significant moment in her lore. There are rumours of a behind-the-scenes Eras documentary to complement the record-breaking concert movie, extending the moment’s IP. Any new tour will once again recalibrate the live industry. Before Swift drops a note of music, or Kelce touches grass, they’re the coming season’s reigning champions.","summary":"Just-announced album already looks like it will make singer and partner Travis Kelce hysterically famous at a new level – and that may be precisely their plan\n\nTaylor Swift’s podcast interview with her American football player boyfriend, Travis Kelce, this week yielded plenty of tidbits for fans.

She speculated that they were 'probably' being conducted to glean citizens' 'immigration status.' \n\nPsaki - after losing roughly half of Rachel Maddow's audience during her first month in the coveted 9pm timeslot - relished in reports that some of the bystanders 'ran into a CVS to quickly make signs warning others that ICE was ahead [while] directing drivers to turn left to avoid the checkpoint. \n\n'You can see one of the signs there they’re holding,' she said. \n\n'That was DC last night,' she eventually concluded. 'The people of DC - which doesn’t surprise me. I’ve lived here a long time - pushing back in practical ways against what Trump is trying to do to the city.' \n\nPsaki is one of a number of liberals who have taken issue with Trump's bid to make the capital more safe.\n\nThey cite statistics showing that crimes have fallen since 2023. But DC has more murders per capita than Bogota in Colombia or Mexico City.\n\nIt is also plagued by far more homicides than New York City, with other liberals conceding that the capital has a serious lawlessness problem that does need tackled. \n\nAt least some DC residents have embraced Trump's forced takeover of Washington, DC's, police force with open arms, including a local black woman who uses the TikTok handle @bigdawglexi.\n\nShe took to the platform to celebrate feeling safer since the first troops started arriving Tuesday morning.\n\n 'Finally able to chill at a red light with my windows down,' she said in a self-filmed video that went viral Friday.

This is something that none of her peers, individually, have been able to do. But to understand how she operates, look no further than Loomer’s latest attempted power play, which, as always, involves a fair amount of self-humiliation (and some disgusting slander).\nEarlier this week, she leaked a private deposition that she’d given in a lawsuit wherein she explained, in her own words, why she’s published some of the most outre takes and allegations against her “enemies” on social media. The deposition was given as part of her defamation suit against HBO host Bill Maher, who claimed on a February 2025 show that Loomer was having a sexual affair with president Donald Trump. But you might have missed that context, since the social media chatter and headlines gravitated toward the sections of the deposition where Loomer was grilled about her most audacious posts: she claimed, among other things, that Sen. Lindsay Graham was secretly gay, that former Vice President Kamala Harris was a “DEI skank”, and her bitter MAGA rival Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) divorced her husband because of the “Arby’s in her pants” and was a “political prostitute [who was] sucking McCarthy’s dick all day.” \nUnsurprisingly, Loomer defended herself and her statements, both in the deposition (“I’m saying she literally—it’s so ridiculous. I’m saying she literally put Arby’s in her pants”) and in public, after the deposition was reported on by Will Sommer at The Bulwark. “I was asked about Lindsey during my deposition so I had to tell the truth. I was under oath,” Loomer tweeted — along with a screenshot of the section where she explained why she believed Graham was gay. \n[Image: Image: @LauraLoomer on X. https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-15-at-6.01.11%E2%80%AFPM.png?quality=90&strip=all]\nHBO’s lawyers immediately argued that Loomer was violating several laws by making the private deposition public, and the document was immediately re-sealed. Loomer, on the other hand, claimed that she was simply trying to showcase that her testimony “went so well that the leftist law firm [representing HBO] wanted to SEAL my deposition.” Whether it went well is somewhat debatable, given the potential legal implications for Loomer violating a court order, as well as the incontrovertibility of Loomer saying some absolutely wild things in a legal deposition, and defending them.\nLoomer described the stunt as another example of “Loomering,” the term that she uses to describe her internet bullying campaigns. At first glance, it’s a tactic honed from her time working as a secret-camera sting operator at Project Veritas, which famously recorded members of the media and academics saying things that could be spun as anti-conservative and amoral. Loomer’s stepped up her game, however, putting herself in front of the camera (and eventually the public eye) to make her point. \nThe fact that she constantly embarrasses herself only enhances the efficacy of “Loomering”: first, shame and embarrassment does not matter in the long term, so long as people are paying attention online. (She said as much the next day: “I wake up everyday to another hit piece. It’s because I am effective and it threatens a lot of people.”) Second: the internet is forever, and even if a judge orders a deposition to be resealed, gawkers will save copies, screenshot the juicy bits, and publish them for posterity. Loomer might have been recorded reading her own tweets out loud and forced to explain the gross bits, but she has also gotten several White House administration officials fired. \nWhile it remains to be seen whether her influence extends beyond Trump’s daily capriciousness, Loomer’s unnerving gift for being an internet bully remains effective as long as she has allies in the administration, who leak her the insider info she publicly uses to humiliate others. (As she said to HBO’s lawyers, her friends in the White House told her that Graham was gay.) And as long as the storm she creates can grab Trump’s attention, he will most likely keep picking up her calls.","summary":"For all the power she wields with the White House's affairs, Laura Loomer does not have the traditional tools that her rivals in the MAGA influencer industrial complex have - the highest follower count, the most political power, the most internet platforms, etc. But the fact remains that she's the influencer responsible for getting Donald [&#8230;]","url":"https://www.theverge.com/politics/760269/laura-loomer-deposition","image":"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/gettyimages-2172052612.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-15 23:36:49","author":"Tina Nguyen","authors":["Tina Nguyen"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.14},{"id":351475784,"title":"Tuvalu considers pulling out of Pacific leaders’ summit amid China-linked power struggle","text":"Tuvalu’s prime minister Feletei Teo said his country may pull out of the region’s top political meeting next month, after host nation Solomon Islands moved to block all external partners – including China, US and Taiwan – from attending.\n\nThe Pacific Islands Forum leaders meeting will be held in Honiara in September.

Even so, homelessness experts and service providers say the unprecedented spending likely prevented the crisis from getting even worse.\n\nDan Schnur, a political science professor with UC Berkeley and the University of Southern California, said the video could be an attempt to appeal to deep-pocketed Silicon Valley donors, who are increasingly turning to conservative candidates.\n\n“The campaign may have decided that there is an opportunity for support in the tech community, so they talked about the problem in San Jose rather than Los Angeles or San Francisco,” Schnur said. “On the other hand, they may have just been in the area with an hour to kill.”\n\nSchnur added that with former Vice President Kamala Harris and Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis officially out of the 2026 governor’s race, there isn’t a candidate with “a natural advantage in Silicon Valley.” Porter, who formerly represented Orange County in Congress, has deeper ties to Southern California.\n\nThe Hilton campaign said the candidate was spending time with his family and unavailable to discuss the video.\n\n“We decided to shoot our video at Columbus Park, home to one of the largest encampments in the area,” campaign spokesperson Hector Barajas said in a statement. “Residents have been asking their local and state representatives the same questions: What about us? What about our community?”\n\nWhile Hilton was quick to slam Newsom and California Democrats more broadly, he refrained from calling out San Jose Mayor Matt Mahan, a moderate Democrat, by name.\n\nLike Hilton, Mahan has been critical of the state’s homelessness response and has pursued more forceful approaches to solving the crisis. Earlier this year, San Jose adopted a controversial ordinance that Mahan proposed to cite or arrest homeless people who repeatedly refuse shelter beds.\n\nMahan’s office did not provide a comment in response to questions about criticisms leveled in the video.\n\nNewsom’s office also did not provide a response and directed questions to local officials.\n\nStarting next week, San Jose plans to clear the Columbus Park encampment, which has been the site of multiple recent fires and a fatal stabbing last year. Despite the danger, families with small children have been known to stay at the camp.\n\nAfter clearing the encampment, the city plans to spend $19.5 million on revitalizing the park, including adding soccer fields, horseshoe pits and pickleball courts.\n\nCity officials say they are working to provide shelter beds for the more than 250 people estimated to be living at the park. But even as local officials open new shelters and an outdoor “safe-sleeping” site in the city’s northside neighborhood, it’s unclear how many camp residents will ultimately be moved off the street.\n\nIn the video, Hilton took particular aim at a policy known as “housing first,” which calls for accepting homeless people into permanent housing without preconditions such as getting sober, agreeing to mental health treatment or finding employment. The idea behind the policy — backed by research and embraced by state officials and, until recently, federal officials — is that homeless people are best able to take advantage of services only after they have safe and stable housing.\n\nHilton contends Democrats’ backing of the strategy is preventing homeless people from getting treatment and leading to wasteful spending on affordable housing projects, which can cost as much as $1 million a door in expensive parts of the state like the Bay Area. Mahan, for his part, has made similar arguments to justify shifting city funds from permanent housing to homeless shelters.\n\n“They make it illegal to solve the problem,” Hilton said.\n\nIn an executive order last month, President Donald Trump directed federal officials to end support for housing first programs that “deprioritize accountability and fail to promote treatment.” Trump also demanded that state and local officials move more homeless people with mental health and drug issues into involuntary care or risk losing federal funding.\n\nAt the state level, some California Democrats have pushed legislation to amend the state’s housing first policy to allow more funding for abstinence-only treatment centers and sober living homes. But those bills have so far failed to make it through the Legislature.","summary":"\"This is Gavin Newsom's California,\" Hilton said in a campaign video.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/08/15/steve-hilton-governor-san-jose-homeless/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SJM-L-ABUNDANCE-04XX-4.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-15 23:00:59","author":"Ethan Varian","authors":["Ethan Varian"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.224},{"id":351470394,"title":"Gov.

Tim Walz is facing criticism for appointing two Democratic donors to the University of Minnesota’s Board of Regents this week, including one who gave nearly $20,000 to his campaigns for governor and Congress.\n\nWalz’s appointment of Samuel Heins, a retired U.S. ambassador to Norway, has drawn particular concern from Republicans as well as some regent finalists who weren’t selected for a spot on the U’s governing board.\n\nHeins, a longtime lawyer, human rights advocate and alum of the U’s Law School, has given Democrats hundreds of thousands of dollars over the years. He donated $11,000 to Walz’s gubernatorial campaigns, $8,400 to his past congressional campaigns and $25,000 to the Kamala Harris campaign after Walz joined the national ticket.\n\n“Samuel Heins is obviously a Democrat major donor,” said state Rep. Marion Rarick, the GOP co-chair of the Minnesota House higher education committee. “The optics are terrible. It looks like a pay-to-play.”\n\nAnother one of Walz’s four regent picks, Ellen Luger, donated at least $3,450 to his gubernatorial campaigns, state campaign finance data shows. Luger is a former minister counselor for agriculture at the U.S. Mission to the United Nations, with experience negotiating international agricultural policy. She also previously served as a trustee at Wellesley College in Massachusetts, and is married to former U.S. Attorney of Minnesota Andrew Luger.\n\nWalz’s appointments to the board come at a critical time for Minnesota’s flagship university, which cut some academic programs and hiked undergraduate resident tuition by 6.5% earlier this summer. The U’s 12 regents serve unpaid, six-year terms and are tasked with approving major policies such as tuition increases and a multibillion-dollar annual budget.\n\nA spokesperson for Walz said in a statement Friday that the governor “appointed a highly-qualified, well-respected slate of statewide leaders to the Board of Regents.”\n\n“He has full confidence in their ability to tackle the challenges facing the University of Minnesota with integrity and dedication,” the spokesperson said.","summary":"One of Walz’s regent picks, Samuel Heins, donated $11,000 to his gubernatorial campaigns and $8,400 to his past congressional campaigns.","url":"https://www.startribune.com/gov-tim-walz-criticized-for-appointing-prominent-democratic-donor-to-us-board-of-regents/601455968","image":"https://arc.stimg.co/startribunemedia/2DDVNCK5TFGOHEEQ4CDDRVPVTY.JPG?&w=1200&ar=1.91:1&fit=crop","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-15 23:00:00","author":"Coast Guard","authors":["Coast Guard"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.094},{"id":351462256,"title":"RFK Jr. claims 'the swamp' is trying to drive a 'wedge' between him and Trump and announces he's NOT running for president in 2028","text":"Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Friday blasted 'the swamp' for trying to drive a wedge between him and President Donald Trump and announced that he was not running for president in 2028. \n\nKennedy took to X to dispel rumors he was eyeing another presidential bid under the nose of Trump, who appointed him HHS head after Kennedy endorsed the Republican and ended his independent 2024 bid last August. \n\nOn Wednesday, Trump's most controversial outside adviser Laura Loomer told Politico Playbook that she wanted a top Kennedy aide ousted, over concerns the adviser was helping the HHS secretary quietly mount a White House run. \n\n'The swamp is in full panic mode,' Kennedy said on X. 'D.C. lobby shops are laboring fiercely to drive a wedge between President Trump and me, hoping to thwart our team from dismantling the status quo and advancing POTUS' Make America Healthy Again agenda.' \n\n'They're pushing the flat-out lie that I'm running for president in 2028,' Kennedy continued. 'Let me be clear: I am running for president in 2028.' \n\nHe added that 'my loyalty is to President Trump and the mission we've started.' \n\nKennedy then addressed Loomer's call for his principal deputy chief of staff and senior counselor, Stefanie Spear, to be fired. \n\nSpear served as his 2024 campaign press secretary, one of Kennedy's most visible campaign officials. \n\n'Their attacks on my staff, especially Stefanie Spear - a fierce, loyal warrior for MAHA who proudly serves in the Trump Administration and works every day to advance President Trump's vision for a healthier, stronger America - are proof we're over the target,' Kennedy said. \n\nOther conservatives in the MAGA movement took issue with Spear just weeks into the administration. \n\nIn February Axios quoted a number of unnamed sources from conservative organizations who had problems with some of Spear's previous social media posts - which expressed support for Democratic causes.\n\nKennedy started his presidential campaign as a Democrat - the party of his famous family - but switched his affiliation to independent in October 2023 when it was clear he wouldn't be able to beat incumbent President Joe Biden in the 2024 Democratic primary. \n\nA year ago, Kennedy joined forces with the Republican Trump - combining the MAGA movement with MAHA - Make America Healthy Again. \n\nThat coalition aided Trump in winning the election against Democratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris in November. \n\nLast month, Axios reported that a call that included hundreds of MAHA supporters, including controversial comedian Russell Brand, appeared to be setting the table for Kennedy to launch another presidential bid. \n\nThat move could ruffle feathers with Trump, who is constitutionally barred from serving a third term, but has already indicated that he wants to play kingmaker in the next presidential election. \n\nThe involvement of Tony Lyons on the call, who had run Kennedy's MAHA PAC, signaled to some attendees that a 2028 bid was in the making. \n\nLyons has protested that interpretation and did so again on Friday. \n\n'The story that Secretary Kennedy was running for president was a made up story. There's no truth to it whatsoever,' he told the Daily Mail. 'Secretary Kennedy never gave any indication that he was planning to run for president.' \n\nLyons said that Kennedy was 'disrupting an entrenched and deeply corrupt system that has allowed a small group of companies to make incredible profits from products that make Americans sick.' \n\n'Those companies are spending millions to attack Secretary Kennedy, Stefanie Spear and the rest of his incredible team,' Lyons continued. 'This is a desperate attempt to protect a revenue stream that is dependent on poisoning the American public.' \n\nKennedy, a prominent vaccine sceptic, was more vague in his post on who was to blame for spreading the 2028 rumors and tarnishing Spear in media reports. \n\n'The president has made himself the answer to my 20-year prayer that God would put me in a position to end the chronic disease epidemic - and that's exactly what my team and I will do until the day he leaves office,' Kennedy said.","summary":"Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

Will voters buy it?","text":"On Thursday, Gavin Newsom announced that he would ask the California legislature to vote to put an initiative to redraw the state’s congressional districts on the ballot in November.\n\nThis, of course, came in response to Texas Republicans, acting on behalf of Donald Trump, attempting to redraw their maps to give additional seats to the GOP in the House of Representatives. All the while, Newsom has roundly mocked Trump and, on social media, mimicked the president’s all-caps style of posting. \n\nNewsom is clearly eyeing a run for president. But he’s also offering something unique: between his bombastic tone and his ability to grab headlines, he’s offering Democrats their own version of Trumpism.\n\nWhen Trump first ran for president and then later stepped into the Oval Office, Republicans regularly would say, “At least he fights.” That refrain allowed them to accept Trump calling Mexicans rapists, impugning prisoners of war and his bragging about grabbing women without their consent. \n\n“The guy's a generational talent,” Mike Madrid, a Hispanic political consultant from California who worked for Republicans, told The Independent. “Most people rely on their own skillset. He's able to adjust, see the political terrain and fight on that terrain and win.”\n\nAnd Madrid saw Newsom’s skill up close in person when he worked on the campaign for Newsom’s 2018 opponent, former Los Angeles Democratic mayor Antonio Villaraigosa. That was the case in 2004, when Newsom presided over same-sex marriages during his time as mayor of San Francisco. In 2008, he famously said, “This door's wide open now. It's going to happen, whether you like it or not.”\n\n“He is best in times of tension and conflict,” Madrid said. \n\nIt’s a major change of fortune for Newsom. After Trump’s victory in 2024, he faced severe criticism for his handling of the wildfires in Southern California. \n\nWhen he launched his podcast at the beginning of 2025, he took heat from other Democrats when he agreed with conservative activist Charlie Kirk about transgender athletes in women’s sports. To this day, many Democrats and LGBT+ activists remain salty.\n\nBut many Democrats still find themselves pleased with his actions against Trump. In June, he sued the Trump administration for sending the National Guard into Los Angeles to quell protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids. \n\nNow, he’s taking Trump on directly, and it seems to have appeal. \n\nEarlier this year, Shannon Watts, a Democratic activist who raised $11 million last year for Kamala Harris, had largely refrained from giving money to Democrats in disappointment at the party’s inability to stand up to Trump. \n\nBut this week, she contributed to Newsom’s campaign. \n\n“I have been waiting for Democrats to meet the moment and to show some fight and to stand up to this administration that is so clearly wanting to be authoritarian,” she told The Independent. \n\n“And this is less of me saying with my money, oh, this is the person that I think will be president. It's more of a vote of a thank you so much for doing what is expected of elected officials and politicians in this moment.” \n\nNewsom still has his weaknesses, of course. He famously faced a recall in 2021 after facing backlash for dining indoors at the French Laundry restaurant without a mask during the pandemic. And his policies of banning homeless encampments have also angered progressives. This is to say nothing of the fact that if he runs, he will have the “Liberal San Francisco mayor” label that might put off swing voters. \n\nBut Watts said her contribution was not an endorsement of him as the Democratic nominee in 2028.\n\n“I had people in my thread say when I tweeted that I was donating, ‘You know, he's not the one,’” Watts said. “That's not the point. This is not about in 2025 who is going to be the Democratic nominee. This is about who is leading the pack in fighting in ways that are new and different, inventive and effective.” \n\nPolling consistently shows that Democratic voters increasingly do not like their leaders and see them as rolling over for Trump. That has, in turn, led to Democrats yearning for someone to fill the gap, Lakshya Jain, a co-founder of the politics website Split Ticket, told The Independent. \n\n“There's not really any way for Democrats to fight against Trump right now,” he said. “Because what letters do they have? They don't control any branch of government. They don't control the Supreme Court, but what is true is they do control the state of California, and the state of California has nine Republicans and a lot of blue turf that's kind of wasted on certain incumbents.” \n\nThat allows Newsom to step out in front and say he is the first one to stand against Texas’s actions. Specifically, the Texas Democrats who decamped to blue states said they would return to Texas because California would respond in kind if Texas passed their new maps. \n\n2028 is a long way off and plenty could change. Other candidates might be able to prove Newsom is a paper tiger. But then again, plenty of Republicans waited for Trump to implode and he laid waste to them. \n\nOn Friday, as Trump met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, Newsom’s office fired off another Trumpian all-caps tweet. \n\n“MANY PEOPLE ARE SAYING THAT DONALD J. WOULD CONSIDER “GIVING AWAY” THE FREE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO HIS ‘BEST FRIEND’ VLADIMIR PUTIN — ALL BECAUSE I, GAVIN C. NEWSOM, STOLE THE CAMERAS THIS WEEK WITH ‘THE MAPS,’ he posted.","summary":"Republicans got behind Trump because ‘at least he fights.’ Will Democrats do the same? asks Eric Garcia","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/gavin-newsom-california-trump-democrats-b2808658.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/14/20/22/SEI262148571.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/OwhkekUr-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-15 22:07:17","author":"Eric Garcia","authors":["Eric Garcia"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.185}]}
