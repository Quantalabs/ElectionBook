We all were, and we’re here today to celebrate the way he lived his life and to remember the way he changed so many of ours. So, I want to start where I know Charlie would want me to, with what was most important to him, and that was his relationship with Christ,” Trump said at the beginning of his speech.\n\nWATCH — Beautiful! Thousands WORSHIP God at Charlie Kirk’s Packed Memorial:\n\n“To say Charlie knew more about the Bible than me is an understatement, folks. It’s like saying Donald Trump knows more about being president than Hillary Clinton or Kamala Harris,” he continued, pointing to an interview of Kirk where he said he would want to be remembered for his courage and faith.\n\n“And let me tell you guys, those were not empty words. Last week, Charlie joined a long line of courageous men and women who were martyred for what they believe. According to the book of Acts, the first martyr in the early Christian church was Stephen who was stoned to death. And as Stephen was being killed, he said, ‘Behold, I see the heavens opened and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.’ Now, there are many times in the Bible where Jesus is seated at the right hand of God, but this is the only time he’s seen standing. And while the Bible isn’t explicit about this, I like to think Jesus was standing to welcome Stephen, the courageous martyr, into heaven,” Trump said, explaining that it gives him great comfort because “11 days ago, as a cowardly assassin crawled on his stomach to end Charlie’s life on Earth.”\n\n“I’m betting Charlie saw the son of God standing tall to welcome him home,” he said, adding that Kirk “always brought out the best in all of us.”\n\n“At one of the last events of the 2024 campaign at Arizona State, some lunatic called in a threat to try to keep us from going on the stage again. We went out there anyway, without fear. Charlie led the way. His message was clear then, and his message is clear now. We won’t back down. … We won’t be intimidated,” he said, noting that the Bible repeatedly says to not be afraid.\n\n“And the 100,000 people here today are a signal to the world, our message of faith, family and country will not be silenced,” he added.","summary":"A relationship with Jesus was the most important thing to Charlie Kirk, Donald Trump Jr. said during the memorial service for the Turning Point USA founder.\n\n\nThe post Donald Trump Jr.: Relationship with Jesus Was the Most Important Thing to Charlie Kirk appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/09/21/donald-trump-jr-relationship-with-jesus-was-the-most-important-thing-to-charlie-kirk/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/09/AP25264771517668-640x335.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-21 23:05:21","author":"Hannah Knudsen","authors":["Hannah Knudsen"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.09},{"id":362362048,"title":"Angelina Jolie comes out as free speech warrior as she claims she 'doesn't recognize' the US anymore","text":"Angelina Jolie has come out in defense of free speech and lamented that she does not 'recognize' the United States anymore.\n\nThe actress, 50, made the remarks while promoting her new film Couture at the San Sebastian Film Festival in Spain.\n\n'Anything, anywhere that divides or limits personal expressions and freedoms, I think, is very dangerous,' Jolie said. \n\nSpeaking about the political turmoil in the US, Jolie said that these are, 'very, very heavy times'.\n\n'I don’t, at this time, recognize my country,' she said.

Trump harangued Gabbard, saying it would scare people and that she appeared more engaged in self-promotion in order to set herself up for higher office, a person familiar with the matter said.Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!\n (You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onTulsi Gabbard security clearancesDirector of National IntelligenceJohn Ratcliffe CIATrump administration intelligence communitysecurity clearance revocations\n\n(Catch all the US News, UK News, Canada News, International Breaking News Events, and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

She wrote that Pete \"would have been an ideal partner — if I were a straight white man.\"\n\n\"But we were already asking a lot of America: to accept a woman, a Black woman, a Black woman married to a Jewish man,\" Kamala wrote, according to the Atlantic. \"Part of me wanted to say, Screw it, let's just do it.

As per an expert, she criticised Biden’s decision to seek a second term as president, describing it as an act of “recklessness” that should never have been driven by “an individual’s ego.”\nSpeaking on Stephen A Smith’s SiriusXM show, Shapiro said he had not read her book, but Harris was going to have to answer for “how she was in the room and yet never said anything publicly,” according to the New York Post.\nShapiro was among a shortlist of candidates for VP under Harris before she picked Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, after Biden pulled out from the presidential race following a disastrous debate against Donald Trump in June last year. Shapiro said he conveyed his own concerns about Biden privately to his team.\n“I was direct with them. I told them my concerns,” he said, adding that his critique was framed around battleground stakes.\nKamala Harris On Shapiro\nIn her memoir, Harris argued that she remained silent during months of growing unease about Joe Biden’s age and political viability because of what she calls her “delicate status” as vice president. She said that she remained loyal but was also as a target of indifference from Joe Biden’s inner circle.\nShe said Shapiro was unusually focused on her shortcomings during vetting, as per the NYP. A spokesperson for Shapiro called those claims “simply ridiculous” and said the Governor was focused on defeating Trump, who went on to win the election.\nBiden, 82, was diagnosed with prostate cancer, which revived questions about what health issues the former US president was dealing with while he was in the White House. The former president had long sparked concerns over his mental health after a series of public gaffes.\nRepublicans argue that Biden, who ran for re-election as the oldest president in history, was physically unfit for office.

And one is playing out in business right now.The first might be called the Direct Method: The government brings down the hammer of censorship by criminally prosecuting an individual or business directly for their speech. From World War I through the 1920s, laws like the Espionage Act authorized imprisoning activists and newspaper publishers who circulated anti-war ideas. Earlier, the Sedition Act of 1798 effectively made it illegal to criticize the sitting president, John Adams, resulting in the prosecution of at least 25 Americans.The second tradition of censorship could be called the Indirect Method, utilizing what First Amendment scholars sometimes call \"soft coercion.\" In this approach, the government leverages all the creative ways it can to punish speech peripherally — by withholding certain benefits, making regulatory tweaks, or tagging groups with toxic legal designations in national security or the tax code. This tradition came to define the McCarthy-era crackdown on Communist sympathizers, which reached its zenith in the 1950s.The suspension this past week of Jimmy Kimmel by ABC — at the apparent behest of FCC Chairman Brendan Carr — bears the features of soft coercion. Expressing displeasure at Kimmel's characterization of Charlie Kirk's assassin, Carr appeared on a podcast to announce that he would consider regulatory punishments for ABC if it didn't remove Kimmel from the air, before adding, \"We can either do this the easy way, or the hard way.\" ABC announced Kimmel's suspension hours later.What followed was a predictable ritual. As a nationwide chorus of political and business icons — from Barack Obama to Joe Rogan to former Disney CEO Michael Eisner — raised their voice in defense of free speech, MAGA partisans charged Democrats with bad faith, claiming that activists were merely being served their own medicine of \"consequence culture.\"Beneath MAGA's reversal is a point worthy of reflection. The First Amendment only prohibits censorship by government, not by private businesses. Nevertheless, corporations and universities, no less than government bureaucrats, can also practice soft coercion. \"Government is not the only thing that can make you unfree,\" Pete Buttiegieg observed when running for president — so can \"your neighbor,\" your \"cable company,\" and an employer. It's when these two forces conspire that the result, historically, spells trouble.The recruitment of private actors for government ends is the marquee feature of soft coercion. And in Carr's remarks, several scholars have identified the same DNA signature that came to define the Red Scare of the 1950s. \"This is clearly a case of unconstitutional threats and coercion of a private actor,\" Evelyn Douek, a professor at Stanford Law School who teaches the First Amendment, wrote by email. \"Like the McCarthy Era, the government is relying on private actors to carry out its speech repression on its behalf.\"In the 1950s, federal and state governments found creative ways to induce private institutions — Hollywood studios, unions, and universities — to purge or blacklist unwanted speakers. Less appreciated, but no less vast, was the pressure campaign waged on private industry. As historian Ellen Schrecker describes in her book \"Many Are the Crimes,\" the country's corporate behemoths in manufacturing and engineering — GE, Bethlehem Steel, RCA, Lockheed, General Motors, and others — were enlisted to cooperate with FBI and Pentagon loyalty screening programs, effectively monitoring the political views of thousands of employees.While some executives resisted somewhat, such as those at Ford, the overwhelmingly majority complied. The auto giants, particularly dependent on government defense contracts, were among the most galvanized by threats of investigations or lost business. GM officials repeatedly testified before Congress, required political loyalty oaths from unions, established a \"loyalty and security\" office, and preemptively fired workers flagged in reports by HUAC. In 1958, across all areas of employment, estimates suggest as many as one in five of Americans were subject to some form of loyalty review.In some respects, the second Trump administration's own efforts mirror this 1950s-era paradigm — not a Red Scare, but a Woke Scare. Under the auspices of reigning in far-left ideology, the administration has implemented a concerted crackdown on speech by foreigners (should they write an impolitic op-ed), private universities (should they fail to make ideological adjustments, like firing DEI staff), and law firms (should they advocate insufficiently for government-approved causes).As for broadcasters, Carr's rationale may be rooted in the First Amendment concept of \"government speech\": while it can't interfere with others' speech, government doesn't have to spend its money on speech it dislikes — and these are the government's licenses, after all. That argument, too, echoes 1950s-era tactics of soft coercion: Here, as then, the administration hasn't made it criminal to advocate left-wing causes, teach left-wing ideas, or litigate for left-wing clients — but if you do, you stand to lose your green card, your research funding, your security clearance, and now, your broadcast license. Corporate America has taken heed of this message, from Target rolling back its DEI policies, to Paramount paying Trump a $16 million settlement of his lawsuit over the editing of a \"60 Minutes\" interview with Kamala Harris.While vast, the Trump administration's practice of soft coercion is also easily comprehensible. It follows three basic techniques — the Heckler's Veto, jawboning, and the use of vagueness — which collectively nudge or compel Americans and their employers to suppress certain types of speech on the administration's behalf.The first tactic is known as the \"Heckler's Veto\" — in which the government outsources the task of censorship to crowds of private citizens, then looks the other way while the mob wreaks havoc. This past week, while guest-hosting \"The Charlie Kirk Show,\" Vice President JD Vance called on millions of Americans to take action. \"When you see someone celebrating Charlie's murder, call them out,\" Vance said. \"And hell, call their employer.\"It is bad morals to celebrate someone's murder. But it is bad civics for a head of state to enforce morals by punitive threat. The illegality of such a scheme would be obvious if Vance had made this request not of private citizens, but of the FBI. Vance's exhortation recalls the FBI's loyalty program but in reverse: a national snitch line, in which private citizens monitor their bosses. As Douek put it: \"The government is trying to use its power to force private actors to do for it what it couldn't do directly — suppress protected political expression.\"The second tactic is \"jawboning.\" The term refers to a strategy in which government officials improperly lobby a private actor to remove or censor third-party speech, often using vague or implied threats. Until recently, it was Democrats who had been tarred with jawboning. In 2024, a federal court ruled the Biden administration had inappropriately pressured Facebook and Twitter to combat vaccine-related and other misinformation. Carr's implied threat to ABC maps with laser precision onto the same jawboning offense.The third and final tactic of soft-coercion censorship is the use of vagueness. Instead of writing laws that articulate clearly what speech is banned, a purposefully vague law (or executive order) leaves doubt as to what speech is legal and which is criminal. Amid this confusion, citizens come to live under perpetual uncertainty that their speech — the next text, tweet, or Slack message — might or might not invite the wrath of criminal prosecution. Vagueness is a First Amendment violation because of its unusual power to achieve widespread self-censorship not by fiat, but doubt — the origin of the concept of \"chilling\" speech.Vagueness appears to be the cornerstone of the administration's censorship strategy — the entirety of which could be conceived as one massive, rolling vagueness violation. Consider two recent examples: A $15 billion lawsuit against The New York Times for defamation (dismissed this week by a federal judge as \"improper and impermissible\"), and an executive order banning flag burning (a black-letter First Amendment violation). But why bring lawsuits and executive orders that can't be enforced?These maneuvers have been described as clear attempts to make Trump's dissatisfaction plainly understood. In reality, the censorship campaign is in many ways seemingly intended not to be understood — designed not to clearly prohibit speech but instead invite the question whether it is. Trump strikes a bargain with law firms, for example, but the agreements aren't publicly written down, and no one publicly knows who has agreed to what. Trump bans the Associated Press from the White House grounds for using the phrase \"Gulf of Mexico,\" but grants access to other outlets that use the same phrase, leaving lawyers to speculate about Trump's motives in court. Even Carr's comments this past week resound in the Kafkaesque, accusing ABC of a vague failure to serve \"the public interest.\" These lawsuits and executive orders serve a similar purpose: to signal loudly that it doesn't credit the First Amendment rules we have come to accept as ironclad — and to invite the next journalist, or activist, to think twice about which free speech guarantee he might discard next.\"Unlike the McCarthy Era, the list of views that are on the forbidden list is much longer and more amorphous and growing every day,\" observes Douek. \"This is not just about suppressing Communism, for example — it seems like it has become dangerous to criticize the government or its allies in general.\"There is one crucialremaining factor that explains the success of Trump's soft coercion: the fecklessness of the institutions — law firms, universities, broadcasters — that have capitulated to it, sometimes with remarkable speed. With this phenomenon, we are reckoning with the casualties of a tragic misadventure that continues to haunt our public life: the abject failure of mainstream Democrats over the last decade to passionately defend free expression as a matter of first principle. By acquiescing to progressives who believed otherwise, the liberal and conservative custodians of these institutions weakened the resolve of their leaders to learn the vocabulary of liberal resistance. Inadvertently, then, they softened the institutional terrain for MAGA's eventual Viktor Orban-style conquest today. It takes years to become proficient in the customs of capitulation — to become acclimated to incessantly kowtowing to offended mobs, for instance, and bending to political whims. In American institutions' 10-year course in political submission, in other words, the left was their first teacher.Now, as people begin building a renewed case for free speech, they should keep two principles in mind, both drawn from the lessons of the 1950s. The first comes from Arthur Koestler. \"You can't help people being right for the wrong reasons,\" the Austro-Hungarian journalist said in 1949. In the coming months, left-wing activists will find themselves making points about free expression that match verbatim the past words of Tucker Carlson and Andrew Tate — a fact they must be prepared to credit and embrace. Anything less, warned Koestler, will poison their cause with the most lethal affliction any argument can suffer: \"Lack of self-confidence.\"The second principle comes from Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas. In 1951, Douglas immediately identified the threat of soft coercion, warning that America would soon \"enter dangerous territory to the liberties of every citizen.\" He also articulated the phenomenon that explains the First Amendment's political staying power: the confidence — faith, really — in the reasoning powers of the American public, and the inherent esteem it conveys toward one's countrymen. Famously, Douglas pronounced a \"confidence in the ability of our people to reject [the] noxious,\" whether in literature, theology, or politics. Today, a coalition of Americans must find a way to project certainty in the reasoning capabilities of every American: a new kind of public faith. This will remain true even if that certainty is later proven to have been tragically misplaced. That is, after all, what faith requires.Benjamin Wofford has written for Wired, Politico Magazine, Vox, and Rolling Stone, and is a graduate of Stanford Law School.","summary":"The three main ways the Trump administration is cracking down on speech.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/beyond-jimmy-kimmel-trump-soft-pressure-silencing-business-2025-9","image":"https://i.insider.com/68cc6418f9db348adc0bc305?width=1200&format=jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-21 15:05:50","author":"Benjamin Wofford","authors":["Benjamin Wofford"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.079},{"id":362306404,"title":"Trump pushes back on Harris’ book claim he privately praised her as a 'tough, smart customer'","text":"President Donald Trump rejected former Vice President Kamala Harris’ claim in her new book that he privately praised her during a concession phone call, saying he was cordial but never described her as a \"tough, smart customer.\" \"[I didn't call her that] that I know of, but I was nice to her,\" Trump told Fox News senior White House correspondent Peter Doocy, co-host of the new program, \"The Sunday Briefing.\" Trump sat down with Doocy for an exclusive interview for the show's debut episode, where he addressed the excerpt explored in a New York Times review of Harris' new book, which chronicles her 2024 campaign run.

It’s been quite some time since the Missouri native performed in her home country, with the end of 2024 marking a particularly rough period for her. In addition to canceling two stateside shows for mental health reasons, she faced onslaughts of backlash for everything from speaking out about predatory fan behaviors to criticizing Kamala Harris amid the presidential race, leading to her largely stepping back from the internet.\n\nChappell Roan Will Headline Laneway Festival 2026\n\nChappell Roan Is Bringing Her New Live Show to 3 U.S. Cities This Fall: Here’s Where She’s Playing\n\nChappell Roan Says She Has ‘No Idea’ What Her Next Album Will Sound Like: ‘That’s the Scary Part’\n\nNow, a packed audience dotted with pink cowboy hats and Lady Liberty crowns — nods to Roan’s getup at the 2024 Governor’s Ball, one of the last times she performed in New York — embraces her completely, every bump in the road forgotten. Looking out at a sea of arms eagerly forming the shapes of the letters “H-O-T-T-O-G-O” (“I think you get it,” she giggles, abandoning her dance tutorial after one run-through), she looks stronger than ever, strutting around the stage in a sexy Captain Hook-esque outfit without missing a note as flames erupt behind her.\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nSaturday’s concert is the first of eight pop-up performances in the U.S. that Roan has generously tacked onto her European Visions of Damsels & Other Dangerous Things Tour, and one of four dates slated for NYC. The setlist is full of high-octane numbers from her 2023 debut album, The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess, with “Super Graphic Ultra Modern Girl,” “Femininomenon,” “After Midnight,” “Naked in Manhattan” (“Can you believe it? We’re in New York!” she yells triumphantly midway through), “Guilty Pleasure” and “Casual” preceding “Hot to Go!,” as well as new single “The Subway,” which recently earned Roan her highest-ever peak on the Billboard Hot 100 at No. 3.\n\nLater in the show, she writhes around on the stage floor while covering Heart’s “Barracuda,” sensually serenades a mic stand topped with a blonde wig for the waltzy “Picture You,” line dances with her bandmates to March single “The Giver” and fills up the stadium with impressive high note after high note during “Good Luck, Babe!,” the breakout hit that catapulted the pop singer to superstardom with unprecedented swiftness in spring 2024. The latter two tracks are expected to appear on Roan’s next LP, which she plans to start work on after the tour ends in October. (“It took me five years to write the first [album], and it’s probably going to take at least five to write the next,” she warned in a recent interview with Vogue.)\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nThough Roan is a total force on stage, polished and magnetic while trouncing around a set made to look like an illustrated fairytale castle, the show is not without her signature frankness. She hilariously breaks character at one point to inform the crowd that she’d totally forgotten her entire “a—s” was on display in her outfit until she was taken by surprise at the sight of her own rear-end on one of the big screens behind her. Toward the end, while singing the vulnerable and now-deeply-ironic “California” about worrying she’ll never make it in the music business, she interjects, “I just saw someone yawn — that’s crazy.”\n\nShe also takes a tender moment to address why her return home is so momentous. “It’s been quite a year,” she tells the crowd around the halfway point in the show. “I can’t believe we’re here, honestly. It’s crazy. Thank you for sticking with me through it, I know it was … it’s been really hard.”\n\n“I’m so glad I can come to work like this,” she continues. “I just needed a place like this so bad when I was 13, 14. I just wanted to dress up however I wanted, and I wanted to wear makeup and look weird. So I hope you know that you’re welcome here, however you show up today. You are cherished.”\n\nAs Roan dives into “Kaleidoscope,” her fans band together to let her know that the feeling is very much mutual. A dazzling rainbow suddenly appears and winks back at her as she sings, with the concert-goers in the back several rows of the stadium holding up multicolored lights in one unified effort.\n\n“Everyone look behind you,” she instructs the rest of the crowd before momentarily forgetting the song’s lyrics, distracted by the emotionally charged gesture — the only hiccup in an otherwise flawless show. “You’ve got the rainbow! It’s a kaleidoscope! It’s so beautiful!”\n\nAfter her stay at Forest Hills, Roan will play two nights in Kansas City before closing out the Visions of Damsels & Other Dangerous Things Tour with two nights in Los Angeles.

And even those close to her doubt it’ll help her buttress her chances for a repeat candidacy.\n\n'It doesn’t mean anything when it comes to 2028, because that’s going to be a huge wide open field,' said one former aide.\n\nEarly excerpts show Harris painting herself as a tragic heroine in the brief period after Biden was forced from the race, reflecting on how and why Democrats collapsed spectacularly against Trump.\n\nFor critics inside the party, her reappearance threatens to repeat the Hillary Clinton playbook after her 2016 defeat — a book, a tour, bitterness, and more division. Democrats are also frustrated that Harris admits to failing to act sooner as Biden stumbled, and even reveals she avoided picking Pete Buttigieg as her running mate because he was gay.\n\n'The truth is that, like Joe Biden before her, she prioritized making sure that her running mate would not overshadow her, and she got what she wanted,' wrote journalist Josh Barro on X. \n\nHarris will face a wary audience. Some activists hope her tour will offer therapy for a grieving party, but others say it risks keeping Democrats stuck in the past while governors like Gavin Newsom and JB Pritzker step up as future leaders for 2028.\n\nHarris’ public reappearance could help the party grieve, some Democrats say, despite the awkward timing.\n\n‘Stare into the abyss and sit in the way you feel right now and see what comes of it,’ one Democratic strategist told the Daily Mail about the party’s path forward after Harris’ failure.\n\nOther Democrats believe while her book tour could be therapeutic, there is a risk of spending too much time looking back rather than turning the page.\n\nRyan Long, a progressive influencer who helped make “brat summer” go viral, said he would be watching for how Harris positioned herself after the tour.\n\n‘She’ll get to see some of her biggest supporters and fans on this tour,’ Long said ‘But I hope that once it’s over, she begins reaching out to those who didn’t vote for her if she has any ambitions for 2028.’\n\nSome Democrats are dismissing the tour as part of a normal cash grab from a failed candidate.\n\n‘She is on a book tour, which is about selling books,’ said Democratic strategist Joe Trippi, a former campaign manager for Howard Dean. ‘I don’t think it impacts the party one way or another.’\n\nThe party remains bitter too and a little bit confused.\n\nWhy is Harris focusing on her leadership failures? Not only did Harris fail to speak up when Biden should have dropped out of the race but she also revealed she was too afraid to select Pete Buttigieg as her running mate because he was gay.\n\nHarris has also left them with an enormous hangover as they try to rebuild, with the $20+ million debt from her failed campaign.\n\nThis leaves the Democratic National Committee crippled with just $15 million cash on hand after picking up the tab.\n\nIt’s one more reason Democrats are not interested in Harris trying to claim the mantle of leadership for 2028.\n\nAnyone seeking the presidency in 2028, one Democratic strategist said, would face a 'full vibrant Democratic primary.'\n\nThe failure to hold a primary was what fractured the Democratic Party in 2024, the advisor reflected, which is ultimately why she lost.\n\nHarris has enjoyed her time out of the spotlight, telling Stephen Colbert she ignored the news and watched a lot of cooking shows, but she may be surprised to find that many of her supporters have moved on in her absence.\n\nSince exiting the leadership stage, the former vice president has not stepped up to tackle any serious issues.\n\nPeople will be watching the book tour, however, for any sign of a political future.\n\nIf Harris tries to rally anti-Trump sentiment, advisors say, it will indicate she has future political goals.\n\n‘The book tour may tell us more about her level of interest in running as Governors Newsom, Pritzker, and others are garnering more attention by standing up to Trump,’ Trippi said.","summary":"Kamala Harris is set to relive her failed White House bid with the release of a new memoir, but Democrats fear her book tour will reopen old wounds and drain energy from the party","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15116123/democrats-kamala-harris-book-tour.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/09/19/21/102295131-0-image-a-4_1758313795418.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-21 14:20:08","author":"Charlie Spiering,Editor","authors":["Charlie Spiering","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.182},{"id":362289024,"title":"'This Week' Transcript 9-21-25: Sen.

A message from President Trump attacking his own attorney general and pressuring her to more aggressively prosecute his political rivals.\n\n\"THIS WEEK\" starts right now.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I just want people to act. They have to act. And we want to act fast.\n\nKARL: President Trump nominates one of his former defense lawyers to take over one of the most important U.S. attorney's offices in the country, and he lashes out at his critics, prompting a national debate over freedom of speech. Trump suggests regulators pull networks off the airwaves over critical coverage.\n\nTRUMP: I would think maybe their license should be taken away.\n\nKARL: ABC suspends \"Jimmy Kimmel Live\" over comments about Charlie Kirk following threats from the chairman of the FCC.\n\nBRENDAN CARR, FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION CHAIR: Frankly, when you see stuff like this, I mean, look, we can do this the easy way or the hard way.\n\nKARL: Prompting a widespread backlash.\n\nSEN. CHRIS MURPHY, (D) CONNECTICUT: That's censorship. That's state speech control.\n\nSEN. TED CRUZ, (R) TEXAS: That's right out of \"Goodfellas.\"\n\nKARL: This morning, Senator Chris Murphy responds to the administration’s latest threats. Chris Christie and Stephen A. Smith. And our roundtable on the political fallout.\n\nVaccine confusion. RFK Jr.'s advisory committee changes its recommendation for multiple vaccines, drawing bipartisan concern.\n\nSEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT): Vaccines are safe and effective.\n\nSEN. BILL Cassidy (R-LA): I can promise you, there will be some Hepatitis B transmission.\n\nKARL: I’ll speak to former CDC Director Dr. Richard Besser.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nANNOUNCER: From ABC News it's \"THIS WEEK.\" Here now, Jonathan Karl.\n\nKARL: Good morning. Welcome to \"THIS WEEK.\"\n\nLater today, family, friends, and supporters of Charlie Kirk will gather in Glendale, Arizona, for his memorial. The 31-year-old activist's murder shocked the nation, and it was condemned by sensible and compassionate people in and out of politics and across the political spectrum.\n\nIt has also been senselessly celebrated by some, a small minority, who didn't like what Kirk stood for and thought it was somehow, therefore, justified. Celebrating or excusing violence is abhorrent. The murder of Charlie Kirk was not a political act. It was a gruesome crime. His alleged killer now faces the death penalty.\n\nOur thoughts this morning are with the Kirk family, especially his two young children, who will now grow up without their father.\n\nWhatever you think of his political views, and there are many who are deeply offended by things he said, Charlie Kirk was an unwavering advocate for free speech. On a personal note, he was always willing to engage with me and answer my questions. He welcomed debate with those he disagreed with. He did not try to silence his critics. He listened to them and tried to change their minds.\n\nAs Charlie Kirk's body is laid to rest, that core principle is under attack in America. The very latest, a new policy at the Pentagon that would require reporters to pledge that they won't gather or use information, even unclassified information, that hasn't been expressly authorized for release and will revoke the press passes of reporters who do not obey. That's a policy you might expect to see in China, Russia, or North Korea, but not in the United States. And the move at the Pentagon follows a series of steps by the federal government to silence voices seen as critical of President Trump.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nKARL (voice over): President Trump began the week by suing \"The New York Times\" for defamation, alleging articles in a book by reporters were, quote, “specifically designed to try and damage his business, personal and political reputation.” That lawsuit was thrown out on Friday by a federal judge who called the complaint, quote, “improper and impermissible,” and said the president's lawsuit attempted to use the courts “to rage against an adversary.”\n\nWhile President Trump was suing \"The New York Times,\" Attorney General Pam Bondi said the Justice Department would crack down on what she called hate speech.\n\nPAM BONDI, ATTORNEY GENERAL: We will absolutely target you, go after you, if you are targeting anyone with hate speech, anything. And that's across the aisle.\n\nKARL (voice over): That comment drew backlash, including from some of Donald Trump's most high-profile allies.\n\nTUCKER CARLSON, HOST OF ‘THE TUCKER CARLSON SHOW’: There’s no sentence that Charlie Kirk would have objected to more than that. Any attempt to impose hate speech laws in this country is a denial of the humanity of American citizens and cannot be allowed under any circumstances. That’s got to be the red line.\n\nKARL (voice over): On Tuesday, I asked the president about the attorney general's comments.\n\nKARL: What do you make of Pam Bondi saying she's going to go after hate speech? Is that -- I mean a lot of people -- a lot of your allies say hate speech is free speech.\n\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: She’ll probably go after people like you because you treat me so unfairly. It's hate. You have a lot of hate in your heart. Maybe they’ll come after ABC.\n\nKARL: Would that be appropriate?\n\nKARL (voice over): And on Wednesday, it was the chairman of the FCC that threatened to use the power of the government to silence the president's critics.\n\nBRENDAN CARR, FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION CHAIR: We can do this the easy way or the hard way. These companies can find ways to change conduct, to take action, frankly, on Kimmel, or, you know, there’s going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.\n\nKARL (voice over): Chairman Brendan Carr was referring to Jimmy Kimmel and these comments he made after the murder of Charlie Kirk.\n\nJIMMY KIMMEL, HOST OF 'JIMMY KIMMEL LIVE': We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them, and doing everything they can to score political points from it.\n\nKARL (voice over): Shortly after Carr's threat, two of the largest owners of local stations across the country, Nexstar and Sinclair, said they would stop airing \"Jimmy Kimmel Live.\" This as Nexstar is in the middle of a merger deal with another media company. A deal that requires Carr's FCC approval to move forward.\n\nDisney ABC then announced it would indefinitely suspend \"Jimmy Kimmel Live,\" sparking an intense debate over free speech. Carr, however, suggested the FCC would continue to put pressure on television stations.\n\nCARR: We at the FCC are going to enforce the public interest obligation. If there’s broadcasters out there that don't like it, they can turn their license in to the FCC. But that's our job.\n\nKARL (voice over): President Trump praised Disney’s decision and targeted NBC late-night host Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers as the next that should go, writing on social media, “do it NBC.” And Trump suggested the FCC revoke licenses from broadcasters that are critical of him.\n\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: They give me only bad publicity, or press. I mean, they’re getting a license. I would think maybe their license should be taken away. It will be up to Brendan Carr.\n\nKARL (voice over): The FCC’s actions drew bipartisan criticism.\n\nSEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, SENATE MINORITY LEADER: That is censorship. It is disgusting. It is a violation of the First Amendment.\n\nSEN. TED CRUZ, (R) TEXAS: I think it is unbelievably dangerous for government to put itself in the position of saying, we're going to decide what speech we like and what we don't, and we're going to threaten to take you off air if we don't like what you're saying.\n\nKARL (voice over): Some legal experts doubt Carr has the right to strip licenses based on political content, but not President Trump.\n\nTRUMP: They have to show honesty and integrity. And when they take a -- when they take a good --\n\nKARL: Who determines that?\n\nTRUMP: Well, I think the people decide. That's why I'm president. When they take a --\n\nKARL: So, that means you decide?\n\nTRUMP: When they take a great success, like you often do, and you make it into like it's a loser, or you put a negative spin on it, ,I don't think that's right. So, I think Brendan Carr is a great American patriot. So, I disagree with Ted Cruz on that.\n\nKARL (voice over): And in another effort to go after his critics this week, the president forced out the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, Erik Siebert, after his office failed to find incriminating evidence of mortgage fraud against New York Attorney General Letitia James. James has long been in Trump's crosshairs after she successfully prosecuted the Trump Organization for fraud. After U.S. Attorney Siebert failed to prosecute James, Trump told me he wanted Siebert out. Hours later, he submitted his resignation.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nKARL (on camera): And overnight, an extraordinary statement from President Trump. It appeared to be a direct message to his attorney general, Pam Bondi, but it was posted on Truth Social for the world to see, pressuring her to prosecute his political enemies. The president wrote, in part, “Pam, I have reviewed over 30 statements and posts saying that essentially same old story as last time, all talk, no action. Nothing is being done. We can't delay any longer. It's killing our reputation and credibility. They impeached me twice. They indicted me five times over nothing. Justice must be served now.”\n\nAnd I am joined now by Democratic senator from Connecticut, Chris Murphy.\n\nSenator Murphy, let's start right there with those words towards Pam Bondi. The president mentioned some of his enemies, including James Comey, the former FBI director, Letitia James. It sounds like he is directly ordering his attorney general to prosecute his enemies.\n\nSEN. CHRIS MURPHY, (D) CONNECTICUT: This is one of the most dangerous moments America has ever faced. We are quickly turning into a banana republic.\n\nThe president of the United States is now employing the full power of the federal government, the FCC, the Department of Justice, in order to punish, lock up, take down off the air all of his political enemies.\n\nAs you know, this is what happens in Iran. This is what happens in Cuba. This is what happens in China and deeply repressive states in which if you have the courage to stand up and speak truth to power, you are silenced.\n\nI mean, there is no more fundamental right in America than the right to protest your government.\n\nAnd the question today is, when is enough, enough for Republicans? I was very glad to see Ted Cruz stand up and say what is simply true -- it is unconstitutional and deeply immoral for the president to jail or to silence his political enemies. And it will come back and boomerang on conservatives and Republicans at some point if this becomes the norm.\n\nBut next week, we need every Republican in the Senate, in the House, not only speaking up, but going to Donald Trump and telling him that they are not going to let him get away with this massive, new contraction of speech. This is a decisive moment for the country. It is a decisive moment for Republicans who have to decide to serve this core, fundamental American value: the freedom of speech.\n\nKARL: OK, we’ll get to the speech aspect of this in a second. But first, what we saw from him overnight with this statement about -- to Pam Bondi, and what we saw Friday with the firing -- he said it was a firing of the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, who investigated Letitia James on this allegation of mortgage fraud, and who found no evidence to move forward with a criminal charge.\n\nThe president believes that he -- well, he knows -- he was targeted for multiple criminal prosecutions, spent most of his time, after he left office, fending those off. And now, he wants to get retribution against those who he believes, he insists, went after him falsely.\n\nMURPHY: Again, it’s really important to underscore what happened here, right? This is a Republican U.S. attorney in Virginia who came to the conclusion that the attorney general of New York did nothing wrong. There was no evidence of a crime.\n\nAnd so Donald Trump, because he doesn’t care about the facts. All he cares about is the threat of imprisonment for his political enemies, so that it suppresses the speech of other people who might speak up, is now going to put his own political loyalist in charge of that investigation.\n\nAnd again, I think you have to put it in even broader context because there’s two things happening.\n\nOne, you are going to be prosecuted for political speech in this country, but you are also going to be excused, you are going to be let off for real, actual criminality if you are a supporter of the president. Witness what happened to every single, violent January 6th protester let out of jail. See what happened to Tom Homan, his border czar, who literally accepted a bag of cash, $50,000, and the investigation was dropped once Donald Trump became president.\n\nSo, there are just two standards of justice now in this country. If you are a friend of the president, a loyalist of the president, you can get away with nearly anything, including beating the hell out of police officers. But if you are an opponent of the president, you may find yourself in jail.\n\nAgain, that is Cuba. That’s Iran. That’s Russia. That is not the United States.\n\nAnd this just has to be a moment where leaders come together, whether you are a Republican or a Democrat, and say enough is enough.\n\nKARL: Let me ask you, you introduced a bill called the No Political Enemies Act. And you say it creates a specific, legal defense for those targeted for political reason -- political reasons. Doesn’t the -- doesn’t the First Amendment cover that? Is that -- is it necessary to have another piece of legislation?\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nKARL: I mean, we have a First Amendment. It is the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n\nMURPHY: Yes, listen, I think what Brendan Carr has done at the FCC is illegal and unconstitutional and if it’s contested in court, I think he will lose.\n\nThe problem, though, is that increasingly you have Trump sycophants, not just in charge of the DOJ, but sitting in courthouses all over the country. And so, you have a legal system that is increasingly getting rigged against those who are daring to speak up against the president.\n\nOur legislation just simply makes it easier for you to raise First Amendment defenses in court. It doesn’t create any new rights, new constitutional rights, it just makes it simpler for people to say when they show up to court, “Listen, I did nothing wrong here. All I did was speak my mind.” It creates an easier avenue for you to contest a prosecution that’s brought against you for just speaking politically about the president.\n\nI wish this legislation weren’t necessary, but I think we’re going to need some exceptional new tools at an exceptional moment.\n\nKARL: You’ve probably seen that a lot of people on X, and social media, are recirculating something that you said back in 2018, arguing that what you said now shows you to be hypocritical in what you’re saying now. Let me -- let me just read from this tweet from yours (ph), and it was still a tweet back then. “Private companies deciding not to let their companies be used to spread hate and lies is not the same as government censorship. If it feels the same, then we need to ask why a small handful of companies have so much control over the content Americans see.”\n\nSo, you know, a lot of the president’s allies will point to a decision like the one made by ABC Disney regarding Jimmy Kimmel in saying, look, this is a private company making a decision that a private company has a right to do.\n\nMURPHY: Well, I think there’s a real difference because these companies made that decision in the context of a threat from the FCC, right? This is a federal regulator who is using the power of government to coheres both Nexstar and ABC to take Jimmy Kimmel down off the air.\n\nListen, every single president, every single politician has drawn issue with something that a media figure has said and may use the power of persuasion to try to get them to change what they say. That’s very different than using the power of government in a coercive way. That’s actually illegal. The Supreme Court has said, no, you cannot use the regulatory power of the government to say to a broadcaster, if you don’t say what I want you to say, as the president of the United States, there will be an official, legal consequence. That’s illegal. And that’s the fundamental difference here.\n\nKARL: So, I want to turn to another subject in the brief time we have left. There was a poll out, I think about (ph) the Democratic Party, there was a poll out earlier this month from Gallup that asked views of socialism and capitalism. And I want to take a look at this part of that poll. It showed that 66 percent of Democrats have a favorable view of socialism. Independents, 38 percent. Just 38 percent. Republicans, 14 percent.\n\nIs that -- is that the future of the -- of the -- of the Democratic Party is a more favorable view of socialism?\n\nMURPHY: No, it is not. But I have seen, I think, even more interesting polling that shows you across party identities people in this country are sick and tried of corporations having so much control over our lives and are sick and tired of work not paying.\n\nSo, I think the Democratic Party has an opportunity to reach into Donald Trump’s base, to really build upon a potential realignment in this country if we are aggressively talking about deconstructing concentrated corporate power, including in the media, and we are talking about fundamentally increasing the amount of money that people make and the protections that they have when they go to work. That’s not socialism, that’s just right-sizing the economy so that people have power instead of corporations having power.\n\nAnd, frankly, I think that’s, you know, why a candidate like the -- like Mamdani in New York is doing so well, because he’s talking about transitioning power from people that don’t have it to people that have it. So, I think that’s the message that ultimately has the potential to unite a lot of right and left.\n\nKARL: We’re out of time, but very quickly, is Chuck Schumer making a mistake by not endorsing Mamdani? He’s like the only major political figure in New York, it seems, that has not endorsed him.\n\nMURPHY: Yes, I guess, I don’t sort of give advice to my colleagues about who they endorse and who they don’t endorse. I think the success of his candidacy is a really important signal to Democrats and Republicans about the power of taking on concentrated corporate power. And I hope that at least my party learns from that.\n\nKARL: All right, Senator Chris Murphy, thank you for being with us this morning.\n\nMURPHY: Appreciate it.\n\nKARL: Up next, we go to Glendale, Arizona, where supporters are lining up to pay their respects to Charlie Kirk. We’re back in just two minutes.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nKARL: That's a look at the long lines outside of State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, this morning where Vice President Vance, President Trump, and many others will be attending the memorial service for Charlie Kirk.\n\nLet's go to ABC's Matt Rivers in Arizona on the heightened security at the event and what to expect later today. Matt?\n\nMATT RIVERS, ABC NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hey, good morning, Jon.\n\nWe're just outside the venue here in Glendale, Arizona, where this memorial is set to take place at 11:00 a.m. Pacific Time. You can see it's very early in the morning, and yet there's already hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people lining up to get into the venue. Organizers saying it's going to take a long time to get in because of the added security elements that have been put in place.\n\nThis is the kind of security levels that we see for Super Bowls. I'm talking thousands of law enforcement officers that are going to be here today to make sure that this goes smoothly. And, of course, tensions ratcheted up a little bit over the weekend after authorities arrested a man pretending to be law enforcement outside of the venue. He was armed, according to police. So that gives people the sense of the sort of threats that we're facing here at this point.\n\nIt's just adding to what's been a very tense time in the country, obviously, since Kirk's killing. The threat of violence very much on people's minds including on the minds of Secret Service because we know President Donald trump and J.D. Vance, the vice president, will be here today among a long list of speakers including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, Tucker Carlson, Donald Trump, Jr. Big names within the conservative politics world. No question about that there.\n\nKirk, of course, a controversial figure in the country, but people who will be showing up here today, many of them really view him as almost a political martyr of sorts in their continued political movement and their fight in this country, Jon. A very, very big event here in Glendale and a massive security presence to boot.\n\nKARL: Our thanks to Matt. You can see full coverage of today's memorial service streaming at 2:00 p.m. Eastern on ABC News Live. \"The Roundtable\" is next. We are back in a moment.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nKARL: All right, and now the roundtable is here.\n\nFormer DNC chair Donna Brazile, Bernie Sanders campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, and the editor of “The SCOTUSBlog”, Sarah Isgur. And in a debut here on “This Week”, executive editor of “The Daily Signal”, Rob Bluey.\n\nAll right. Sarah, as a former spokesperson for the Department of Justice, I have to ask you, what is the impact when the president of the United States puts out a message like he did last night, basically slamming his attorney general for not prosecuting his enemies?\n\nSARAH ISGUR, ABC NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: This is bad for the Department of Justice. It's bad for the country. But I do think we should take a bigger view here.\n\nKARL: Yeah.\n\nISGUR: When you look at during the Obama administration using the power of the presidency to target Tea Party groups through the IRS, during the Biden administration using the power of the presidency to target social media companies. Mark Zuckerberg saying they were threatened if they didn't take down information on COVID origins. And now, using the power of the presidency, whether through the FCC or the Department of Justice, to limit criticism.\n\nWe should be talking about the power of the presidency because, frankly, there is no legislation that is going to prevent abuses of power by the president. We have to take away that power. The FCC shouldn't have this power. The IRS have this power.\n\nAnd until we're willing to talk about that, this is just going to turn into a tit-for-tat, and it's going nowhere good.\n\nKARL: So, I want to play something that Pam Bondi said at her confirmation hearing. This is when she was asked specifically about whether or not she would refrain from acting politically in that job. Take a listen.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nPAM BONDI, ATTORNEY GENERAL: That will not be the case if I am attorney general. I will not politicize that office. I will not target people simply because of their political affiliation. Justice will be administered evenhandedly throughout this country.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nKARL: Right, Donna, she's now going to have to test that proposition.\n\nDONNA BRAZILE, ABC NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Absolutely. Look, she's the chief law enforcement officer of the United States of America. That should -- she should hold that position in higher regards.\n\nWhat we're seeing now is a pressure campaign like we see a pressure campaign across the board in the Trump administration. Do as I say or else.\n\nAnd what I saw last night, I was shocked. He -- it looked private, but it became a public attack on the attorney general. I want you to, you know, go ahead and prosecute my enemies. Go ahead and find dirt on my enemies or else. That's what Donald Trump -- that's the signal he was sending to Pam Bondi last night.\n\nFAIZ SHAKIR, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: When you pull back out and you look at the politics, that the wheels are coming off the Trump train a bit, and he knows it.\n\nYou see the standing on the economy. People are getting angrier and angrier that he isn't looking out for them. Healthcare premiums higher, electricity bills higher, grocery prices higher. He's seeing that in the polls.\n\nSo, now, a couple things are happening -- distraction. So hey, I got to get on my front foot. I'm going to go attack my opponents. And he's looking for somebody to blame.\n\nSo, if I'm going down, instead of being a person, a president with honesty and credibility, says “I want to look out for people,” I'm going to find somebody else. I'm going to say it's Jon Karl's fault that things are going terribly.\n\nKARL: So -- so, Rob, we understand -- our reporting is that the leadership of the Department of Justice, Pam Bondi, Todd Blanche, opposed what Trump did on Friday, which was fire the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, because he would not -- he didn't find evidence to prosecute the president's enemies, Letitia James specifically, and James Comey.\n\nROBERT BLUEY, THE DAILY SIGNAL PRESIDENT & EXECUTIVE EDITOR: Jon, one of the most important roles of a president is obviously picking personnel, and President Trump has been known over the course of his first term and now the second term that he wants people in those positions who are going to move swiftly and get things done. And so, if the president is displeased with somebody, it's his prerogative to remove them from a position.\n\nThat's all -- “personnel is policy” in Washington, D.C., we all know that. And so, ultimately, if a cabinet secretary may disagree with the president on that, that’s a battle that will obviously play out.\n\nBut in this particular case, I think what you're seeing is a frustration by President Trump that things are not moving swiftly enough. Secondly --\n\nKARL: Swiftly enough on what?\n\nBLUEY: Swiftly enough across the board. I think that he --\n\nKARL: But about -- about he wants -- he wants --\n\nBLUEY: He wants these -- these investigations to come to a conclusion. The president said, if they're guilty, let's make sure that we pursue that. If they're not guilty, that's fine too. I mean, that was what the -- those were the president's words.\n\nSARAH ISGUR, EDITOR AT SCOTUSBLOG & ABC NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: The timing is that the statute of limitations is about to run in a week. And so they either have to bring charges or they don't --\n\nKARL: Against who?\n\nISGUR: And if they don't have evidence to bring to a grand jury, this is going to be incredibly embarrassing for them.\n\nKARL: OK. But our understanding is they spent five months, that office. This is one of the most important U.S. attorney's offices in the country, spent five months looking into this allegation of mortgage fraud and found there wasn't evidence to bring a case.\n\nISGUR: In fact, if anything, they found evidence on the --\n\nKARL: Exonerated her (ph).\n\nISGUR: -- opposite. Yes. Correct.\n\nKARL: OK. I want to move to the other part of this, which is the free speech component. An editorial in The Free Press, Bari Weiss Free Press about what happened with Disney, A BC suspending Jimmy Kimmel show. Take a look at this. They write, the circumstances under which he has been suspended should alarm anyone who cares about free speech. It is now Trump -- is it now Trump administration policy to punish broadcasters for comedy that doesn't conform to its politics? That is censorship. For the MAGA crowd who might like what they're seeing from Carr, remember that Democrats will wield this power again and when they do, they will play by new rules that Carr and the Trump administration just established.\n\nRob, let me ask you, we saw very strong words from Ted Cruz and from Tucker Carlson, highly critical of what the FCC is doing. What -- where does MAGA world break down on all of this?\n\nBLUEY: Well, John, I do have sympathy for those who have concerns about free speech. I came to Washington, D.C. My first job was to defend reporters who were facing free speech challenges. And we ourselves have suffered under the Biden administration when the Biden White House revoked the credentials of The Daily Signal and 440 other reporters two years ago, in 2023. And so I know what it's like to be on the receiving end.\n\nAt the same time, I think we need to take a step back, hopefully, and judge that Brendan Carr was asked his opinion on a podcast. He gave his opinion. He did not institute any sort of regulatory action against ABC. It was Nexstar and Sinclair that decided to preempt the show, which is what prompted ABC to do this (ph).\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nKARL: Well, that's what this editorial is about, jawboning. When an official that has the power goes out and says that kind of stuff, the Supreme Court has said that can be a form of censorship. Donna?\n\nDONNA BRAZILE, ABC NEWS CONTRIBUTOR & FORMER DNC CHAIR: Yeah. He sent a message. No question that Brendan, who in the past has spoken out in terms of free speech, he's been an advocate of speaking truth to power. And when you lose that right, when you lose that ability to hold elected leaders and others accountable, when a comic cannot make a mistake and then come back and correct his mistake, when we've reached this destination in our country where people cannot criticize official leaders, then we've -- we're losing a key guardrail of our democracy.\n\nFAIZ SHAKIR, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST & BERNIE SANDERS 2020 CAMPAIGN MANAGER: Yeah. I would just, to my friends on the right, with all due respect, I do think we're in a different moment. This isn't tit for tat. This isn't like something in the past. I believe, and you may disagree with me, that this is something very different. This isn't a person looking out for trying to object -- solve for COVID or some issue that is relevant to the American public.\n\nThis is a person who's looking out purely for their own self-interest, self-preservation. Me, Trump, my cronyism, go and defend my personal interest. Dear Department of Justice, dear IRS, dear Fed Reserve, whatever it is I want, you are supposed to do pure nonstop. That's what's being governed here. This is the interest of Trump.\n\nISGUR: I actually don't disagree on that, but the mechanisms by which to do it, saying if we will take away your Section 230 protection and the Federal Communications Decency Act, if you don't take down this speech that we don't like on your platform, is what the Biden administration did. Add in more curse words according to Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nLook, I think it's great that we saw so many voices from across the spectrum on the right, absolutely going after Pam Bondi for her statements about hate speech. But you know what sort of struck me? Ted Cruz isn't a podcaster. I mean, he said that on a podcast. He's a U.S. Senator. The actual solve for this is to do something, to actually have political accountability, which is the job of a Senator. Actually do something to rein in a president (ph).\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nKARL: We'll see where he goes. Hey, but before we go, I see that my friend Donna has got a book over there, the new Kamala Harris book.\n\nBRAZILE: It is not autographed, Jon, so it may not be worth a lot right now.\n\nKARL: So, this book has created quite a stir. It is not even out. It comes out on Tuesday, but obviously excerpt is out. I want to read from one of the excerpts where she describes a phone call that she got from Joe Biden the day of her debate with Donald Trump. Joe then rattled on about his own former debate performances. I beat him the other time. I wasn't feeling well the last one. He continued to insist that his debate performance had not hurt him much with the electorate. I was barely listening.\n\nNow, she also says that she was wondering why he was distracting her on -- when she had to be concentrating and getting ready for debate. She seems quite upset with her --\n\nBRAZILE: And you know what -- you know what Doug said to her at that moment --\n\nBRAZILE: Day 56, let it go. Let it go. Focus on what you're about to do.\n\nLook, if you've never been on a presidential campaign, if you've never run for president, this is a great book. It’s a promise, a starter for young people who want to figure out what it's like to be on a campaign trail.\n\nFrom that vantage point of view, I enjoyed reading the book. But from the vantage point of myself as somebody who knows what happened in 2024, it doesn't answer a lot of questions that we still need to learn from what happened. When you go from having 20 -- 81 million people in 2020 to a little over 75 million, there are a lot of unanswered questions in this book, but it's a read in terms of what the future might look like for Kamala Harris, not the Democratic Party.\n\nKARL: What do -- what do you think of all the score settling there? And does -- does she have a future? Is she --\n\nSHAKIR: I doubt it. No. I -- I mean, you’ve got to be somebody with -- people are looking for people with conviction and integrity in time of corruption, economic corruption, political corruption. Who’s going to have the honesty and integrity to stand up to power? And, you know, some of the decisions she's making, she said, I wasn't in control. It wasn't my fault. It was somebody else. I'm like, who? Then who was in control? You know, you got to -- you don't listen to consultants and the donor class. If you want to step into the political arena, you stand on your own two feet, you make tough decisions, and you own them, and you have a vision and a strategy, and I don't think it came through in the book.\n\nISGUR: It's a testament to the failure of the left on their increasing purity test. You have Neera Tanden out there now saying they are going to have to start looking at candidates who might not agree with them on everything. Maybe a pro-life Democrat could do more for the party than anything else right now.\n\nKARL: All right, we’ve got to take a quick break.\n\nComing up, our next guests are never afraid to speak their mind. We have Stephen A. Smith and former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.\n\nWe will be right back.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSTEPHEN A. SMITH, HOST OF SIRIUSXM'S 'STRAIGHT SHOOTER WITH STEPHEN A,' & HOST OF ESPN'S 'FIRST TAKE': There's an excerpt in there where she says, quote, “it's Joe and Jill's decision. We all said that, like a mantra, as if we’d all been hypnotized. Was it grace or was it recklessness?” My question would be, why didn't you say that before?\n\nGOV. JOSH SHAPIRO, (D) PENNSYLVANIA: I mean, look, I haven't read the former vice president's book. And -- and she's going to have to --\n\nSMITH: (INAUDIBLE).\n\nSHAPIRO: She's going to have to answer to how she was in the room and yet never said anything publicly.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nKARL: That was Stephen A. Smith, the host of ESPN’s \"First Take,\" who launched a new show this week \"Straight Shooter with Stephen A.\" on Sirus XM’s POTUS Channel 124.\n\nStephen A. joins me now, alongside with former -- alongside former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie right here in the studio.\n\nStephen A, let me start with you on the Kamala Harris book. Josh Shapiro told you, hey, she has to explain why she didn't speak up on Biden's ability to run earlier. You also said that her career, her political career is over. What --\n\nSTEPHEN A. SMITH, HOST, ESPN’S “FIRST TAKE”: Yes.\n\nKARL: Elaborate.\n\nSMITH: Well, there's nothing to elaborate about. Who cares what she has to say at this particular moment in time? I hope the book is successful.\n\nWhen you had an opportunity as the Democratic nominee for the presidency of the United States of America to address so many different issues and instead what you did was go into protective mode, you wanted to show your loyalty or what have you, and then you lose the election, and what you want to do is point out all the reasons that you didn't win and point the finger of blame it seems in everybody else's direction instead of yourself, I don't think that she's going to have any support from the Democratic Party. I can tell you that much.\n\nAnd then you have to take into consideration the level of support that she had coming in. This is an individual that was -- you know, that was used to bypass what some would say the democratic process is. There was no primary.\n\nYes, the -- he -- Biden was awful during that debate, that June 27th. Yes, he ultimately stepped away in July.\n\nBut if you talk to many people within the Democratic Party, they were talking about how this was all part of the plan because had he departed significantly earlier, when we all saw slippage in him as far as -- I was on the record a year earlier seeing the slippage. Had he departed, there would have been a Democratic primary. She would have had to compete to be the Democratic nominee.\n\nAnd there were people who did not want her to do that because clearly, they didn't believe --\n\nKARL: You know --\n\nSMITH: -- whether it was Gavin Newsom, whether it was Barack Obama or somebody else.\n\nAnd it seems like she knew it. And that was the kind of feedback she received. And to talk about all of that now, post-election loss, nobody wants --\n\nKARL: You know --\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nSMITH: -- into the win.\n\nKARL: You know, I got to say just quickly on this, she didn't speak up, but neither did Josh Shapiro. Neither did Gavin Newsom.\n\nSMITH: Yeah.\n\nKARL: Neither did all -- I mean, you know, everybody just kind of stood by --\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nSMITH: Oh, I did (ph).\n\nKARL: -- and you know?\n\nSMITH: No, no, no, no, no. Jon, don't do that. Don't do that.\n\nJosh Shapiro is the governor of the state of Pennsylvania. He has a job. He's in office. Okay?\n\nThe reality is that you were the vice president. You were swearing up and down that you were in the room for all the major decisions, and then come to find out you're acknowledging that that was not the case.\n\nSo, if you're an American voter, which I am because I am no politician. I am an American voter. I am a conscientious observer, and I'm hearing this stuff from you now, which was -- which was opposite of what you were verbalizing to America in pursuit of their vote.\n\nKARL: All right.\n\nSMITH: Now that you're trying to sell a book and we're hearing a totally different tune. All I'm trying to say to you is that folks are going to remember that and you weren't that strong of a candidate before. Respectfully, remember she didn't make it to Iowa --\n\nKARL: All right.\n\nSMITH: -- in 2020. Okay?\n\nAnd then in 2024, you lost every swing state. You lost a popular vote for the first time since 2004. Nobody wants to hear now. I believe her political career is over.\n\nKARL: Okay. So, Chris Christie, I don't think you probably disagree with much of that. So, I want to get on to something else --\n\nCHRIS CHRISTIE, ABC NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes.\n\nKARL: -- which is the extraordinary statement we saw from Donald Trump calling on his attorney general, really slamming her for not prosecuting more aggressively his political enemies and the firing of this U.S. attorney in the Easten District of Virginia. What do you -- what's going on?\n\nCHRISTIE: Well, what's going on is everything that I predicted during the 2024 campaign, Jon. Donald Trump's not contentious being president. He wants to be a prosecutor in every district where he has an enemy, so that he can make the decisions.\n\nNow look, the way our justice system has been set up since the beginning of this country is that the president designates someone with the experience and the education in every district across the country to make decisions on how federal prosecutorial powers should be used. Not the president making those decisions, who has neither the education nor the experience to judge whether there are facts sufficient to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt under a statute in this country.\n\nSo, when that doesn't happen, people believe those decisions are now being made for personal reasons, not legal ones. And that creates a slippery slope in our -- in our justice system. Now, we will have a very difficult time coming back from.\n\nAnd so, he doesn't have to agree with every decision a U.S. attorney makes. And by the way, he doesn't have the background, the experience, or the education to make an educated judgment on that.\n\nKARL: So, is Pam Bondi going to follow the orders? I mean, are we going to see prosecutions where prosecutors say there aren't evidence?\n\nCHRISTIE: I -- you know, we're all going to have to wait and see.\n\nBut I will say this, I think it's disconcerting to have a situation where the attorney general of the United States, the deputy attorney general of the United States, sit by and without a word, without a peep publicly of any concern about the fact that the president of the United States said specifically he's firing this guy because initially in the initial post he put up was because Letitia James hasn't been prosecuted.\n\nThen, someone got to him, Jon, because when he came out with the tuxedo on, he said, well, let's just make a decision whether it's innocent or guilty --\n\nKARL: All right. I see Stephen A., you want to jump in. What have you got? What do you make of this?\n\nSTEPHEN A. SMITH, HOST OF SIRIUSXM'S \"STRAIGHT SHOOTER WITH STEPHEN A,\" & HOST OF ESPN'S \"FIRST TAKE\": Well, first of all, I completely agree with my buddy, Governor Chris Christie right there. He's absolutely right on the money. And I -- but I also think that we need to highlight those who are educated, those who are experienced, that are supposed to have a spine if they're going to be in this positions and say, where are they?\n\nDonald Trump is Donald Trump. We knew what he was going to be from the standpoint of his behavior. He is on a vengeance tour. He is on a tour for retribution. He remembers every naysayer out there that has come after him, and he's going after them. And he's unapologetic about that. Well, duh, we all knew that.\n\nThe question is, what are our elected officials going to do about it? What are members of his administration who have their own careers, went to school, got their education, worked their way through the terrain, elevated themselves in this system that we're talking about here that we live under, what are you going to do if you're Pam Bondi? What are you going to do if you're Kash Patel?\n\nWhat are you going to do if you're a host of Representatives in the House or the Senate, who call yourself members of the GOP, who call yourself conservatives who live off the Constitution? So you say, and you see his willingness to bypass rules and regulations, if he can get away with it to get what he wants, what are you going to do about that?\n\nSo we can set up the lament (ph) that there's more that a Ted Cruz can do, but I applaud him for speaking up about Donald Trump in the position that he took, and Brendan Carr at the FCC Commission, and the position that he took. We need folks like that because if you're conducting yourselves based off of those principles, then we are not as concerned about accusations of authoritarianism and things of that nature, because we know you're not going to be able to get away with it when we got 435 Representatives and a hundred Senators.\n\nBut if you're not going to do anything, you're not going to show that you have a spine, then he's going to be able to do whatever he wants to do. And if his number one goal is retribution, there's a whole bunch of people that's going to be in a world of trouble.\n\nKARL: Campaign was about retribution. It's what he promised.\n\nAnd they -- look, they -- as -- and Stephen's right, they all swore an oath to the Constitution, not to Donald Trump. And so, what Pam Bondi and Todd Blanche are going to have to show now is, did they mean the oath when they took it? Because their oath was to protect the Constitution of the United States and to protect the rule of order in this country and the rule of law. And we want to see what they do there.\n\nAnd this not only applies to them, but in the other topic you're talking about with Brendan Carr, look, I did a number of organized crime cases when I was U.S. attorney in New Jersey. When someone says we can do this the easy way or the hard way --\n\nKARL: You've heard that line before.\n\nCHRISTIE: Yeah. That's not subtle. That's something you usually hear on a wiretap with some guys in Hoboken. OK? Not from the chairman of the FCC. And let's hear from somebody who's actually on Mount Rushmore, Jon. Teddy Roosevelt talked about this and he said, to announce that there must be no criticism of the president or that were to stand by the president right or wrong is not only unpatriotic and servile, it is morally treasonable to the American people. Maybe we should be listening to one of the voices that's really on Mount Rushmore.\n\nKARL: All right, with your invocation of Mount Rushmore and the Rough Rider Teddy Roosevelt, we are out of time. Stephen A. Smith, Chris Christie, thank you very much.\n\nUp next, CDC Acting Director Dr. Richard Besser on what families need to know after RFK Jr.'s handpicked Advisory Committee offered new guidance on several vaccines. We're back in just a moment.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSUSAN MONAREZ, FORMER CDC DIRECTOR: He asked me to pre-commit to signing off on each and one of the forthcoming ACIP recommendations regardless of whether or not there was scientific evidence. He just wanted blanket approval. And if I could not commit to approval of each and every one of the recommendations that would be forthcoming, I needed to resign.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nKARL: That was former CDC director Susan Monarez testifying on Capitol Hill this week giving her account of the events that led HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. to fire her last month. That testimony came just days before Kennedy's vaccine panel voted to change several vaccine recommendations.\n\nI am joined now by the CEO of The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the former acting director of the CDC, Dr. Richard Besser, to talk about those changes.\n\nBefore we get to the vaccines, Dr. Besser, what did you take away from Monarez's testimony and account directly contradicting what Bobby Kennedy has said about why she was fired just shortly after she was confirmed, nominated by the president of the United States and confirmed?\n\nDR. RICHARD BESSER, FORMER ACTING CDC DIRECTOR, ROBERT WOOD JOHNSON CEO AND PRESIDENT: Yes, you know, Jon, she had -- she had told me the same information before she was actually fired. What we saw on display was integrity. That's what integrity looks like. That's what you need to see as the director of CDC. You want someone who has a line that they won't cross, and that line has to be science and truth, because they're so entrusted in maintaining and protecting the health of people here and around the world.\n\nKARL: So this CDC panel on vaccines came out two days of rather confusing discussion and some recommendations. Can you explain to us what they changed and what it means for Americans?\n\nBESSER: Yes. This -- to someone who is not steeped in public health, this whole conversation and process is really confusing. This advisory committee makes the recommendations that affect what takes place when you see your doctor. I practiced pediatrics for over 30 years and I looked to the CDC to give me the recommendations that I could then talk to a mom about as to why we were recommending a vaccine, what the disease was we were trying to prevent, what the risks and benefits were of being exposed to the disease as well as from the vaccine.\n\nWhat we saw on display Thursday and Friday was chaos. This is a group of people -- there are a few people on there who understand vaccines, understand the process, but largely it's a group of people who are steeped in anti-vaccine ideology, who don't understand how to evaluate the key concepts. And we saw them not being exactly sure what they were voting on, and in the end, what they did was they failed to recommend the COVID vaccine to very young children and the elderly, two groups who are at the highest risk of having a bad outcome from COVID.\n\nMy biggest takeaway as a doctor is that I can't look to the CDC anymore for the trusted information. I'm going to need to look to medical societies and other groups to provide that information. But the tragic thing is that this committee determines whether insurance isgoing to pay for this for everyone -- every child in America. And that is going to cost lives.\n\nKARL: I mean, it's so confusing to Americans of all types, but especially with young children, wondering what to do with their children. Do you listen to the government? Do you listen to expert groups, doctors? What do you listen to?\n\nBut let me just ask you big picture. Bobby Kennedy came into office, obviously with a long track record of raising doubts about vaccines, an anti-vaccine crusade he was on. What kind of a lasting impact is he having on the way Americans perceive vaccines and on the health of the country?\n\nBESSER: Yeah, I mean, Secretary Kennedy was one of the nation's leading anti-vaccine crusaders, and he came in on a mission and he is moving forward with that mission. He has stocked this committee with so many people who are part of the anti-vaccine movement, who have an agenda. He is instilling mistrust in vaccines.\n\nWhat you want to do is ensure that people have the information when they're seeing their doctor to make an informed choice. And what this process over these two days did was it instilled doubt in a lot of people who didn't have doubt. And it's going to lead people who were trying to do the right thing for their families, for their children, to make wrong decisions.\n\nIt's what he was about from the beginning. It's not what he told Senator Cassidy, he was going to do when he was up for confirmation. But he came in, immediately removed the expert committee, one that we all relied on and brought in people who would move forward his agenda. And he's not done yet. I'm very worried that he's going to bring more people on, because some of the votes didn't go the way that he would've liked this week, and that is very, very concerning.\n\nKARL: And let's not forget Operation Warp Speed, which created the COVID vaccine, is something Donald Trump has, I think, rightfully appointed to as one of the real major accomplishments from his first term.\n\nDr. Richard Besser, thank you for helping us understand what went down this week. Really appreciate your time.\n\nWhen we come back, some powerful words about politics and journalism from the late Robert Redford. We're back in a moment.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nKARL: Before we go, some powerful words from Hollywood legend Robert Redford, who passed away this week. He spoke about journalism in a 2017 interview for the HBO documentary, \"The Newspapermen.\" Take a listen.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nROBERT REDFORD, ACTOR, DIRECTOR & PRODUCER: I don't have a lot of regard for politics per se, but the relationship between politics and journalism, I do have, because journalism is what keeps politics straight. It is -- is politics telling the truth or not? You know? And very often politics doesn't tell the truth. It just tells a story that's being told by one side or the other. But it's journalism that gets to the bottom line and says, wait a minute, that we're hearing this, we're hearing that. But what's the truth?\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nKARL: Wise words. Thanks for sharing part of your Sunday with us. Have a great day.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)","summary":"Sen. Chris Murphy, Dr. Richard Besser & Stephen A.

Look under my keyboard,’ Robinson said in one text. Under it, the partner found a note that said: ‘I had the opportunity to take out Charlie Kirk, and I’m going to take it.’\n\nRobinson’s next hearing has been scheduled for September 29 at 10am, and will be held using WebEx.\n\nWho is Tyler Robinson?\n\nMr Cox told reporters the suspect had lived for a long time with his family in Washington County in the southwest corner of Utah, near the Arizona and Nevada borders.\n\nRobinson did not appear to have any criminal history, according to state records.\n\nHe was a registered voter but was not affiliated with a political party, according to voter records.\n\nHe is listed as an ‘inactive’ voter, which indicates he did not cast a ballot in last year’s presidential election, when Republican Trump defeated Democrat Kamala Harris.\n\n Mr Kirk, 31, was answering a question about gun violence at Utah Valley University on Wednesday when he was shot (Picture: Reuters)\n\n The body of Charlie Kirk is carried from Air Force Two (Picture: Reuters)\n\nAt the time of the shooting, he was a third-year student in the electrical apprenticeship program at Dixie Technical College, part of Utah’s public university system.\n\nAn honour roll student in high school who scored in the 99th percentile nationally on standardised tests, he was admitted to Utah State University in 2021 on a prestigious academic scholarship, according to a video of him reading his acceptance letter posted to a family member’s social media account.\n\nHe attended for only one semester, according to a university spokesperson. He’s now enrolled as a third-year student in the electrical apprenticeship program at Dixie Technical College in St George.\n\n Images show what appears to be a young man wearing dark clothing including a shirt with what appears to be an American flag (Picture: FBI Salt Lake City/ZUMA Press Wire/Shutterstock)\n\n Utah Valley University shooting map (Picture: Metro)\n\nA neighbour, Steven Green, said he knew the family from attending the same Mormon church down the street.\n\n‘Great family, good kids,’ he said, though he added he did not know Tyler Robinson well.\n\nCanaan Timothy, 21, said he was in the year below Robinson at high school. Robinson, he said, was just a regular student with an interest in music, who hung out with members of the school band.\n\n‘I knew him in passing. Just your average kid,’ said Timothy, who lives two blocks from the Robinson family.\n\n‘Tyler, he was quiet, but not too quiet.’\n\nWho are his parents?\n\nRobinson has two younger brothers, and his parents Amber Jones Robinson and Matt Robinson have been married for about 25 years, according to social media posts.\n\nHis parents are registered to vote as Republicans but none of their social media posts appeared overtly political.\n\nPosts by Robinson’s mother reflect an active family with vacations to Disneyland, Hawaii, the Caribbean and Alaska.\n\nThey frequently spent time outdoors — boating, fishing, riding ATVs, zip-lining and target shooting. A 2017 post shows the family visiting a military facility and posing with assault rifles.\n\n Caption: People cashing in on Charlie Kirk’s death selling ‘gunman’s shirt’\n\nA young Robinson is shown smiling as he grips the handles of a 50-caliber heavy machine gun.\n\nRobert Sylvester has lived on the same tree-lined street as the Robinson family for about six years and described the family as ‘pretty quiet’, adding that the suspect’s father keeps busy as a contractor.\n\n‘They’re not unlike most families,’ he said.\n\nWhat do we know about Robinson’s alleged motive?\n\nInvestigators are still working to understand what allegedly led Robinson to that rooftop.\n\nOfficials have not yet identified a precise motive for the shooting, though they offered some clues in announcing his arrest the day after the shooting. \n\nMr Cox told reporters that a family member interviewed by law enforcement said Robinson had recently mentioned Kirk’s scheduled appearance at Utah Valley University, where he was shot.\n\n‘They talked about why they didn’t like him and the viewpoints he had,’ Cox said, without offering further details.\n\nRobinson had also become more political in recent years, the family member told investigators, and authorities said he had engraved what appeared to be anti-fascist messages on bullet casings they found with the suspected murder weapon.\n\nWhat rifle did the gunman use and what did the bullet casings say?\n\nThe governor declined to discuss possible motives for the killing.\n\nBut in describing inscriptions investigators found on ammunition recovered from the scene, Mr Cox said one of the casings bore the message: ‘Here fascist! CATCH,’ adding in response to reporters’ questions: ‘I think that speaks for itself.’\n\n To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web\n browser that\n supports HTML5\n video\n\n Up Next\n\n Previous Page\n\n Next Page\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAnother was reportedly etched with the message: ‘Bella ciao’ – the title of a Second World War Italian anti-fascist song.\n\nA third allegedly read: ‘If you read this, you are gay LMAO.’\n\nIn addition, a roommate shared with authorities messages from the chatting app Discord that involved a contact named Tyler and discussed a rifle wrapped in a towel, engraved bullets and a scope, the governor said.\n\nA Mauser .30-caliber, bolt-action rifle was found in a towel in a wooded area along the path investigators believe Robinson took after firing a single shot from a distant roof and then fleeing.\n\nGet in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.\n\nFor more stories like this, check our news page.","summary":"Footage shows the moment the alleged shooter ran from a university rooftop from which the fatal shot is believed to have been fired.","url":"https://metro.co.uk/2025/09/21/tyler-robinson-know-charlie-kirks-killer-2-24222569/","image":"https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/SEC_265838324-0bce.jpg?quality=90&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-21 13:08:00","author":"Brooke Davies","authors":["Brooke Davies"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.351},{"id":362270178,"title":"Turning Point’s Erika Kirk turns grief to mobilization for young conservative women","text":"“The cries of this widow will echo around this world like a battle cry,” she declared, calling the moment a test of “spiritual warfare.” Within hours, images of her speech circulated widely online, described by supporters as a call to “rise up.” By Thursday, the board had confirmed her ascendance, naming her chief executive and chair of Turning Point USA.\n\nPOLITICAL VIOLENCE ON THE RISE IN THE US: A TIMELINE OF KEY INCIDENTS \n\nAmong those keeping vigil outside the headquarters was Erica Rodriguez, a 24-year-old from Albuquerque, who said she first met Charlie Kirk when her Turning Point chapter at the University of New Mexico came under siege from protests and a Title IX complaint in 2022. Kirk, she recalled, flew in to stand beside her. “He came and had an event for my chapter, made sure that we didn’t feel left out or alone,” Rodriguez said. “He was my mentor, like a big brother.”\n\nShe had heard Erika speak at three of Turning Point’s Young Women’s Leadership Summits, which drew about 3,000 attendees this year. The focus on dating, parenting, and lifestyle, she said, resonated more than policy talk. “She was always kind of out there, but she was always next to Charlie,” Rodriguez said. “Now she has to be on her own, and I’m so sad for her, but having that national spotlight to repeat the message she’s always shared is powerful.”\n\nThat message struck Rodriguez at a pivotal moment in her own life. She spoke about recently calling off an engagement, explaining that after hearing Erika talk about her marriage, she realized she wanted a deeper kind of partnership. “Listening to her talk about Charlie, I could never have talked about that man the way she talks about him,” Rodriguez said. “That makes me want to go find someone even better than what I already had.”\n\nHer perspective also underscored the challenge conservatives face with women her age. After knocking on doors for Republican campaigns in New Mexico in 2024, Rodriguez saw firsthand how young men turned out in greater numbers than young women. She believes Erika Kirk could help change that, especially by challenging cultural pressures she feels are holding women back.\n\n“We have to stop telling women that we have to do all of the things,” she said. “The more they work, the less they like it. I don’t want to be working full time thinking about children at home that I should be taking care of instead, because that should be my first ministry.”\n\nAfter the 2024 election, when young men swung sharply toward Donald Trump, conservatives pointed to the numbers as proof that years of courting disaffected male voters had paid off. Men under 30 gave Trump some of his strongest margins, with only about 46% backing then-Vice President Kamala Harris, according to Catalist. Young women, however, moved in the opposite direction. Nearly two-thirds supported Harris, keeping Democrats’ advantage intact and highlighting the limits of Trump’s appeal. \n\nFor Republicans, and for Turning Point USA and its political arm, Turning Point Action, the gap has become both glaring and urgent. Winning young men helped deliver Trump back to the White House, but higher turnout and continued Democratic loyalty among young women remain a hurdle.\n\nCharlie Kirk came and converted the young men. Erika Kirk is coming to convert the young women.— Tyler Bowyer (@tylerbowyer) September 19, 2025\n\nTyler Bowyer, Turning Point Action’s chief operating officer, put it more bluntly in a post on X that quickly went viral: “Charlie Kirk came and converted the young men. Erika Kirk is coming to convert the young women.”\n\nIn an interview, Bowyer said that the line reflected both grief and optimism. For years, he explained, Turning Point focused heavily on young men, convinced a “weakening of masculinity” had rippled through politics, faith, and family life. Charlie Kirk, he said, tapped into that crisis, and the 2024 election proved it, with young men turning out in record numbers.\n\nWhat Bowyer didn’t expect was how quickly Erika Kirk would spark a parallel reaction among women. “This week my inbox has been flooded, 80% to 90% from women, saying their hearts have been changed, that now they want to get involved,” he said. “That’s never happened before. Usually, it’s almost all men.”\n\nAmong those moved was Nicole Gervais, a 26-year-old from Tucson who had followed Charlie Kirk on social media for the past five years and admired his boldness in sharing both his politics and his faith. “He was the voice of my generation,” she said. “He wasn’t afraid to share the gospel and the love of Jesus with everyone. That was so inspiring to me. I’m ready to go out there and do the same thing.”\n\nNow, Gervais says she looks to Erika Kirk as a “Proverbs 31 woman” whose example could spark a revival. “We have something so wonderful to look up to and try to follow in their footsteps,” she said. Motivated by the moment, she has begun organizing a Turning Point chapter at a nearby high school tied to the elementary school where she teaches. \n\nThe test of Erika Kirk’s appeal will come quickly, with the 2026 midterm elections offering the first chance to see whether young women rally in greater numbers.\n\nAmong those watching closely is 16-year-old Ella Udzinski of Stuart, Florida, who said Erika Kirk’s message had already pushed some of her friends to church and away from the Democratic Party. Her friend, Gracyn Rathel of Orlando, will be 18 by November 2026, and says she plans to cast her first ballot for Republicans.\n\n“I think young women are craving something the Democratic Party isn’t giving them,” Rathel said. “Voting will be my chance to help bring that change.”\n\nWhether that sentiment can be scaled beyond the vigil in Phoenix may determine how much Erika Kirk reshapes her late husband’s movement, and whether Republicans can finally make inroads with young women.\n\nOPINION: CHARLIE KIRK WAS MURDERED FOR WINNING THE WAR OF PUBLIC PERSUASION\n\nHistory suggests it won’t be easy. Since 1992, women under 30 have backed Democrats by double-digit margins in every presidential election, giving the party some of its strongest support. Midterm elections show a similar pattern. Youth turnout reached about 28% in 2018 and dropped to 23% in 2022, according to Tufts University’s CIRCLE project. Even in those lower-turnout years, young voters, especially young women, leaned heavily Democratic. It’s a reminder that shifting young women to the right would require breaking one of the most durable trends in American politics.\n\nBowyer said the mission now is to push forward anyway. “All we can do is the work that Charlie tasked us with,” he said. “To till the ground with as much effort and muscle as we can, every single day, to capture the hearts and minds of as many people as possible before 2026.”","summary":"PHOENIX, ARIZONA – Erika Kirk’s leadership after her husband Charlie Kirk&#8216;s assassination has resonated with young women and given hope at Turning Point USA that the traditionally liberal-leaning demographic will find a permanent home in the conservative movement.

Rep. Randy Feenstra (R-IA), who announced his gubernatorial bid earlier this year, told the Washington Examiner that he expects more members to quit as the midterm elections approach. \n\n“There’s a lot of institutional knowledge leaving, that’s never a good thing for the institution,” Feenstra said. “However, I do believe in term limits that people should serve a total of 12 years in the House and so those that are leaving after that, I think that’s a good thing to bring in new blood is always good.”\n\nMany House members eye the upper chamber, with Reps. Andy Barr (R-KY), Mike Collins (R-GA), Ashley Hinson, Buddy Carter (R-GA), and Barry Moore (R-AL) are seeking a Senate seat. Others are throwing their hats into a gubernatorial race, as Reps. John Rose (R-TN) and John James (R-MI) look to move back home.\n\nTwo major fiscal hawks are heading for the door as Reps. Ralph Norman (R-SC) and Chip Roy (R-TX) eye higher offices, as both sit on the powerful House Rules Committee. Norman launched his gubernatorial bid in South Carolina earlier this year, as Roy has been campaigning to be Texas’s next attorney general. Both members are known to hold their votes during many large, contentious votes in an effort to get more spending cuts. \n\n“I just think a lot of us who have been up here trying to fight the fight for the American people, there’s reasons for us to take that fight home to our states,” Roy told the Washington Examiner. “Whether you’re talking about Andy Biggs or Byron Donalds or myself or Ralph Norman or others that are running statewide.”\n\n“We recognize that a lot of the decisions that affect the people we represent are back home in our states, and there’s a lot more work left to be done in Texas and the other states and to carry this whole fight forward,” he continued.\n\nAnother fiscal hawk, Rep. Andy Biggs (R-AZ), has entered what is considered a “toss-up” race to be Arizona’s next governor. \n\nOne of the first House members to jump into a gubernatorial race was Rep. Byron Donalds (R-FL), who is vying to succeed Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL), who ran for president in 2024 and is term-limited come 2026 in a seat that is considered “solid Republican.”\n\nLongtime foreign policy hawk, Rep. Michael McCaul (R-TX), is slated for retirement after two decades in Congress. McCaul is one of the most influential voices from the massive Texas delegation, leaving large shoes to fill. The Texas Republican was term-limited in chairing the committees he led, saying that this is the right time to leave. McCaul is not the only Texas Republican heading for retirement; Rep. Morgan Luttrell announced his retirement from Congress after just two terms.\n\nSouth Carolina is shaping up to be a competitive governor’s race as Norman and Rep. Nancy Mace (R-SC) threw their hat in the ring. Norman told the Washington Examiner he is confident he could beat Mace.\n\n“Competition is good, you give people a choice,” Norman said earlier this year. “That’s what made the country great, and I love the competitive part.”\n\nMace is a major personality in the House, often ruffling the feathers of both sides of the aisle as she is known to target members regardless of their party. This week, Mace aimed to censure Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) for comments she made about the late Charlie Kirk, but four of her colleagues ultimately tanked the resolution. The South Carolina Republican then called out her four colleagues on social media. \n\nRep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) is teasing her gubernatorial run against Gov. Kathy Hochul (D-NY) after her nomination for President Donald Trump’s Cabinet was pulled over the slim House majority. The New York Republican is a close ally of Trump and has taken jabs at Hochul in recent months.\n\nOn the other end of the caucus, Rep. Dusty Johnson (R-SD) jumped into the race earlier this year, after hinting for months, to be the next governor of South Dakota, as the sitting Gov. Larry Rhoden (R-SD) has yet to announce his future plans. Johnson is a member of the Problem Solvers Caucus, often serving as a moderate voice to leadership. \n\n“Washington functions better when both sides work together on policies that will benefit the American people,” Johnson said on the Problem Solvers Caucus website. “I’m proud to be a part of a team focused on bridging divides rather than encouraging them.”\n\nRep. Don Bacon (R-NE) also heads for retirement after winning his ultra-competitive seat five cycles in a row. He held on to his Nebraska seat, anchored to the blue city of Omaha, last year even as Vice President Kamala Harris won the district by nearly 5 points. Each cycle, he is consistently rated as one of the most endangered House Republicans. The Nebraska Republican credited his success to a “killer instinct” last month in an interview with the Washington Examiner. \n\n“I just wasn’t sure I was going to have the intensity for a sixth run,” he said.\n\nBacon’s retirement instantly makes his district more of a pickup opportunity for Democrats, who must net just three seats to retake control of the House next year. It could also mean one fewer centrist Republican in a chamber that continues to become more polarized. \n\nAs these key players and personalities head for the door, “new blood” will take their seats, bringing their own personality to the lower chamber. House Democrats also face a major wave of retirements and turnover for higher offices following the party’s major loss in 2024, which will lead to a shake-up in the makeup of both sides of the aisle in the House. Although Democrats also face members leaving, only 11 Democrats are leaving now compared to the 17 Republicans.\n\nBut these numbers are not set in stone. More retirements and campaigns are expected before the 119th Congress comes to a close. Rep. Julia Letlow (R-LA) is weighing a Senate bid to run against incumbent Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA), and Rep. Diana Harshbarger (R-TN) would be under consideration for Sen. Marsha Blackburn’s Senate seat should Blackburn become governor. \n\n“These are not supposed to be permanent jobs,” Roy told the Washington Examiner. “You’re not supposed to come up here for 40 years, notwithstanding the fact people do. I think you come up here, you serve and go back home, that’s the way it was designed, so I’m good with it. New blood is good.\n\n“I think that will carry forward the fight up here, with or without me or anyone else,” he concluded.","summary":"Major House personalities head for the door as 2026 rolls around, leaving many wondering how the lower chamber will change with these shifts.&#160; The House Republican caucus comprises many different factions that bring their own concerns to the table, often making Speaker Mike Johnson’s job the “hardest job in Washington” when aiming to appease each [&#8230;]","url":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/3816384/major-house-republican-players-exit-higher-office-retirement/","image":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/retiring-house-republicans-e1758328720662.jpg?1758314157&#038;w=696","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-21 11:00:00","author":"Lauren Green","authors":["Lauren Green"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.036},{"id":362270174,"title":"Schwarzenegger’s star appeal and political reach tested in Proposition 50 redistricting fight","text":"Schwarzenegger helped create California’s independent redistricting system more than a decade ago to prevent politicians from unfairly drawing district boundaries. It’s a key part of his legacy, and he’s keen on preserving it.\n\n“They are trying to fight for democracy by getting rid of the democratic principles of California,” Schwarzenegger told hundreds of students at an event at the University of Southern California this week. “It is insane to let that happen.” \n\nThe 78-year-old said saying no to Proposition 50 was a no-brainer and argued it was more about democracy than politics. “There was no transparency here, the way they drew the maps,” he said. “That is the most important thing in democracy, is transparency.”\n\nProposition 50 is a ballot measure that would approve a new congressional map passed by the state legislature and possibly give Democrats five additional House seats. The push for new maps is a direct response to Texas redrawing its map in favor of Republicans at the request of President Donald Trump, who is seeking to hold on to power during next year’s midterm elections. \n\nAt stake is control of the House of Representatives. Republicans have a 219-212 edge in the House, with four vacancies. Trump has been able to enact his agenda because the GOP controls the White House and both chambers of Congress. If Democrats flip the House, they could stifle Trump during his last two years in office by blocking his legislation and launching congressional investigations.\n\nSchwarznegger, a frequent Trump critic, doesn’t think the ends justify the means. \n\n“It doesn’t make any sense to me that because we have to fight Trump, to become Trump,” he said. “Two wrongs don’t make a right.”\n\nLance Christensen, vice president of government affairs at California Policy Center, believes Schwarzenegger might be the perfect spokesman to thwart Newsom’s plans and get Californians to reject Proposition 50.\n\n“Schwarzenegger is especially relevant because this was his legacy policy, to have fair districts drawn by the voters, rather than politicians picking their voters,” Christensen told the Washington Examiner. “He also appeals to the independents and moderate Democrats who are not particularly swayed by Newsom’s craven political moves, because he’s also a fierce critic of President Donald Trump. He can speak to purple Californians in a way that most others cannot.”\n\nNot only has Schwarzenegger been openly dismissive of Trump’s rejection of the 2020 presidential election results, but he also endorsed Trump’s Democratic rival, former Vice President Kamala Harris, in last year’s election. That, President of Klink Campaigns, Inc. Matt Klink told the Washington Examiner, gives Schwarzenegger the credibility to influence a large swath of California voters. \n\n“Arnold’s involvement is important because he has the ability to fly above politics,” Klink said. “He is marginally a Republican and certainly no fan of Donald Trump. But, he invested significant political capital in creating the independent redistricting commission and has been vocal about its potential demise.”\n\nDespite Schwarzenegger’s recent comments denouncing Proposition 50, he has, so far, declined to record any ads for the campaigns against the ballot measure or raise money for them. His team allowed one of the committees to come to his event at USC with a camera crew to capture his opposition, which was shared on social media. \n\n“His appeal as a global superstar transcends politics and ideology,” Amy Thoma Tan, the spokeswoman for an opposition to Proposition 50 campaign bankrolled by Charles Munger Jr., said. “I think the message he delivered will really resonate with people who are tired of politics of extremes on either side.”\n\nMunger, a Republican donor, has given $30 million to the cause. \n\n“Gerrymanders are a cancer, and mid-decade gerrymanders are a metastasis,” he said in an opinion piece in the New York Times. “If we trade away California’s independent redistricting for a partisan power grab, we kill the cure. We send a dangerous message to the rest of the country that reform is conditional and principles can be abandoned when they are inconvenient. That is how cynicism spreads, trust in government erodes and citizen voices fade.”\n\nNEWSOM SIGNS LEGISLATION THAT WOULD BOOST OIL PRODUCTION \n\nFor his part, Newsom, along with national Democratic leaders such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), held an hourslong virtual rally this week. They framed the stakes of the ballot measure as nothing short of existential, saying it needed to pass to preserve democracy. \n\n“It’s all at stake,” Newsom said. “This is a profound and consequential moment in American history. We can lose this republic if we do not assert ourselves and stand tall at this moment and stand guard [for] this republic and our democracy. I feel that in my bones.”","summary":"Arnold Schwarzenegger has finally gotten into California&#8217;s redistricting fight, using his star power to tell voters to reject Gov.

Gavin Newsom signed a ban Saturday that prohibits all law enforcement officers — except the California Highway Patrol, which protects former Vice President Kamala Harris — from wearing masks. The measure is aimed at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers — over whom acting U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli said Newsom has “no jurisdiction.”\n\nAs Breitbart News reported last week, the bill, SB 627, was proposed by radical State Sen. Scott Wiener (D-San Francisco) — the same politician responsible for such extreme legislation as the “sanctuary state” for transgender surgeries for minors.

Acting U.S. Attorney Essayli said that the law will have “no effect” on ICE operations, and dared Newsom to ban masks among criminals.\n\nIronically, Newsom’s California enforced some of the nation’s toughest mask and vaccine mandates during the coronavirus pandemic.

The former three-term congressman ran unsuccessfully to unseat incumbent GOP Senator Ted Cruz last year, but as he pointed out, he did better than Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris.\"I'm proud that we outran or outperformed, whatever you want to say, our presidential ticket dramatically around the state, and in some areas where Democrats have really been struggling, like in the Valley, with huge differences, winning counties and flipping counties that [President Donald] Trump was winning as well,\" he told Newsweek in an exclusive Zoom interview on Friday.Why It MattersMany analysts expect Democrats to perform well nationally in the coming 2026 midterm elections due to a historical trend of the opposition party generally over-performing, in addition to Democrats' success in recent special elections. However, the U.S. Senate map is expected to be tough for the party. There are only a few possible pickup opportunities for the party, while two currently Democratic-held seats are in swing states won by President Donald Trump in November.Democrats have consistently hoped to flip Texas, pouring massive sums of money into statewide races for governor and Senate in recent cycles, but ultimately falling short each time. A win in the southwestern state would go a long way next year to help the party flip the Senate, or at the very least narrow the GOP's majority. With two other prominent Democrats—state Representative James Talarico and former International Space Station (ISS) commander Colonel Terry Virts—already in the race, and other big names speculated to join, Allred needs to convince Texas Democrats that he has the best shot of beating a Republican in the general election.What To KnowAllred is approaching this Senate primary campaign by working to meet voters where they are. One key strategy has been attending high school football games, something which the former NFL player said is at least partially just for his own enjoyment.\"I enjoy going to high school games and my favorite time playing any sports was high school football. I enjoyed my time in college, I enjoyed the NFL, but it was high school that I enjoyed most,\" he told Newsweek.For Allred, he uses these events as an opportunity to talk with parents, coaches and educators.\"I think in a way that setting is a setting where we can have a conversation that's just not so explicitly political, where people can be pretty honest and they're relaxed, having a good time,\" he said, who also explained that in that setting, he feels like he is \"having some of the best conversations\" of the campaign.Beyond attending sporting events, Allred said he is going to a variety of different settings to meet voters, mentioning barbershops, restaurants and constructions sites. \"There are a lot of Texans who are working harder and harder for less,\" he said, adding that he wants to be \"a voice for those folks.\"Allred expressed confidence in his campaign and Democrats' ability to flip Texas. \"We can win here, and when we do, I think it'll be something that the entire country can pay attention to,\" he said.Allred's Plan to Tackle CorruptionThe former congressman recently unveiled an anti-corruption plan that calls for specific steps he believes will improve the democratic process and curb the influence of billionaires and corporations in politics.\"I feel really strongly about this, that corruption is not just bad, it's not just wrong, but that it also hurts people, that it hurts working people in particular,\" he said.Allred's plan calls for an end to gerrymandering, addresses corporate and billionaire money in politics, aims to strengthen the Federal Election Commission (FEC), pushes to ban individual stock trading by members of Congress and calls for automatically registering eligible voters, among other key priorities.\"It's about fixing our elections and also trying to fix what I think is a broken Congress,\" he said, taking particular aim at stock trading in Congress, something that some high-profile Republican lawmakers have also pushed to ban.\"It's ridiculous to me that members of Congress are trading stocks. In six years in Congress, I never traded a single stock because I had insider information. It's an inherent conflict of interest,\" Allred said. \"For us to unrig what I consider to be a rigged economy, we also have to unrig what I considered to be rigged system, and that means taking on corruption as well.\"When it comes to gerrymandering, Texas has been in the spotlight after GOP lawmakers in the state pushed through new election maps at the behest of Trump over the summer. While nothing is certain in politics, the redrawn districts are expected to net the GOP an additional five House seats.\"I hate gerrymandering period and I think the goal has to be to ban it nationwide,\" Allred said, adding that the new Texas maps also specifically target minority communities.\"I think that a fair ruling would find this to be a racial gerrymander, which is still impermissible. Even the Supreme Court has left in place that you cannot discriminate racially in the drawing of districts, and I think this would meet that threshold in my professional opinion,\" Allred said.Despite his assessment, he cautioned that it's unclear how the courts will actually rule. The current Court has a 6-3 conservative majority, with three of the sitting justices having been appointed by Trump. Allred also said he wasn't confident that the courts would act quickly to address the issue.\"I do worry about the timing, about whether or not this can be fully heard in time, and also whether they'll just find a way to get out of doing what I think is a straightforward approach to this,\" he said.Concerns About Free SpeechAfter the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk earlier this month, some Republicans and Trump administration officials have floated crackdowns on \"hate speech\" and targeting critics of Kirk's and the administration. Allred expressed sadness for Kirk's family, and said leaders need to unite in condemning political violence. But he also raised concerns about what many see as a crackdown on \"free speech.\"\"As a dad and a husband, my first thoughts were about Charlie Kirk's family, just how horrific it was for his wife, for his children. Nobody deserves that. And this should never happen in our politics,\" he said.However, as the administration has floated targeting critics and left-wing groups, Allred said Democrats need to \"stand up for the Constitution.\"\"I feel this very strongly, that this is not about the individual being targeted. It never has been. In our entire history, it's never been about the person who's being targeted and their speech,\" he said. \"It's always been about that we as a country have committed ourselves to the idea of free speech. That's always the ground that we should defend.\"Allred said Americans have always and will continue to \"disagree strongly,\" but that throughout history Americans have \"stood up for this idea that I may disagree with everything you said but I'll fight to the death for your right to say it.\"\"In this country we don't have to worry that you can't criticize the administration,\" he said. \"Here in the United States, we're the land of the free and the home of the brave.\"What People Are SayingJames Talarico to Semafor on Allred earlier this month: \"I really like Colin already, personally. I was probably his most active surrogate in 2024. If he's the nominee, I'm 100 percent onboard. But I do think I'm tapping into something that's a little deeper than typical politics.\"Chris Gustafson, communications director at the GOP's Senate Leadership Fund, in a July statement: \"Colin Allred is an out of touch Washington, DC liberal...Texas voters have already rejected Allred for the radical liberal he is, and they'll do it again next fall.\"What Happens NextIt's unclear whether additional Democrats will enter the race, as several high-profile names—including Representative Jasmine Crockett and former Congressman Beto O'Rourke—have said they'd consider a run. On the Republican side, Senator John Cornyn is seeking reelection while facing a primary challenge from Attorney General Ken Paxton. GOP Representative Wesley Hunt also appears to be edging closer to entering the race.The Texas primary will be held on March 3, 2026.Full Transcript of Colin Allred InterviewThe transcript has been lightly edited for clarity.Newsweek: It's been over three decades since a Democrat has won statewide in Texas. Why do you think this midterm could be the moment that changes and a Democrat wins?I think Texas is in many ways, maybe the biggest test for Democrats. If we can compete here, if we can build the coalition that we need here, then we can do it anywhere. And so I think it also forces the Republicans in Texas, who have taken my great state and who have gone so far and been so extreme, it forces them to defend some of the things that I think are really indefensible that they've done here.I'm a fourth generation Texan, my boys are fifth generation Texans. I know who we are, I know what's important to Texans and I want to fight for my state and I know that there are so many folks out there who are hoping that somebody's going to see them at some point. Because there are a lot of Texans who are working harder and harder for less. They feel like nobody's listening to them. No one sees them. I talk to them all the time. When I'm working in restaurants, which I've been doing, when I'm on construction sites, which I've been going to, I want to go to barber shops, and I want to be a voice for those folks. We can win here, and when we do, I think it'll be something that the entire country can pay attention to.This is your second go around, you ran in 2024 unsuccessfully against Senator Ted Cruz. I think some would ask, why do you expect a different result going into 2026?We ran against some pretty strong headwinds in the last election. And I'm proud that we outran or outperformed whatever you want to say, our presidential ticket, dramatically around the state and in some areas where Democrats have really been struggling, like in the Valley, with huge differences, winning counties and flipping counties that Trump was winning as well. But I also felt really strongly that we needed to refocus and recenter around working people and around what they're going through. And that's my story. No one has to tell me about it. I don't have to read a white paper about it, I was raised by a single mother here in Dallas who was a public school teacher. I grew up struggling, growing up, going to our public schools, knowing exactly what folks are going through right now. I made my living by showering after work instead of before it like a lot of working folks do. As a football player, that's how I paid for my college time and made it to the NFL.I want to go fight for these working folks and re-center our politics around them, but also our policy. Because every Texan I talk to feels like they're working harder and harder for less. Like they are spending less time with their kids. They are swimming against the stream and no one is seeing them. No one is helping them. While the stock market is setting records, working people are bringing home less. And they were promised in the last election that their costs were going to go down, that inflation was going to go away on day one. They'd get an economy back where they thought that they could get ahead. And they were lied to. They were just flat out lied to, this big bust of a bill that they passed, it's one of the biggest wealth transfers from working people to the wealthy in American history.We've seen outright corruption, the kind that we've just never really experienced in the modern era in this country. And working people are noticing this. And I think we have to speak directly to them. That's how we win, but I think it's also how we bring the country to a better place.You just touched on corruption and actually that was my next question. I know you unveiled this 12-point plan. Could you just give us some of the highlights of that and why do you think that's particularly important in this election cycle?I feel really strongly about this, that corruption is not just bad, it's not just wrong, but that it also hurts people, that it hurts working people in particular. It comes in many different forms, but this is the first of actually a multi-part plan that we'll be putting out. It's about fixing our elections and also trying to fix what I think is a broken Congress.It does important things like banning gerrymandering. I think we can all see how that is affecting the country. I was a voting rights lawyer before I ever ran for Congress, and I hate gerrymandering. I think it leaves us with more extreme elected officials who are responsible and responsive to only a very small sliver of their primary electorate. I think if you look at the House of Representatives and wonder why it's so broken, you can point a lot of that to gerrymandering.I also think we need to have much stronger ethics rules in place. It's ridiculous to me that members of Congress are trading stocks. In six years in Congress, I never traded a single stock, because I had insider information. It's an inherent conflict of interest. Trying to get secret money out of our politics, stop the revolving door that we have going on with elected officials and lobbyists. And also just seeing and showing to folks that this corruption shows up in the bills that are passed that are then creating loopholes for special interests while you're getting screwed. That's what we're seeing from folks like John Cornyn for years. So, to me, for us to unrig what I consider to be a rigged economy, we also have to unrig what I considered to be rigged system, and that means taking on corruption as well.As part of your campaign, you've been attending a lot of high school football games throughout Texas. Can you talk about the goal of that strategy and why you think that could help you break through with voters?Part of it is I just like to and I enjoy going to high school games, and my favorite time playing any sports was high school football. I enjoyed my time in college, I enjoyed the NFL, but it was high school that I enjoyed most. And I'm still in touch with my high school football coaches, they're still some of the most important people in my life. What I really like doing at these games is talking to folks who work at the school, talking to the athletic directors, the coaches, the principals, and then going to talk to some of the parents in the stands while the game is going on. I think in a way that setting is a setting where we can have a conversation that's just not so explicitly political, where people can be pretty honest and they're relaxed, having a good time, they're watching their kids do what they enjoy doing. And in that setting, I feel like I'm having some of the best conversations that I have out on the road. I really enjoy it.I think there are a lot of lessons that we could learn in our politics from football, to be quite honest with you, about accountability, honesty, determination, leadership, working together as a team, seeing something as larger than yourself. And the sense of community that you'll see at a Texas high school football game is something that is probably not seen at all around the country. But it's a place where the entire community comes together and is enjoying themselves and doing something that I think has a lot of value.One of your opponents, James Talarico, has spoken quite favorably of you, but of course he's running against you. What are your thoughts about the challenge coming from him? And why are you the better candidate for Democrats?I know who I am, why I'm running and what I want to do. I always have felt like—from my athletic career that I embrace competition. I'm fine with competition. I think I do much better when I have competition. But the way I compete is by trying to be the best version of myself. I think that for me, I know why I am in this race. I'm in this race because I feel like stories like mine are getting too hard for other folks to follow, that if you're raised by a single mother, if you never met your father, my father died when I was 10 years old, he was an alcoholic and went to public schools. Let's be honest, folks who look like me and come from where I come from usually don't make it this far.So what I want to do is ensure that stories like mine are not unique, and that folks have a chance to get ahead. I see us in the business of creating opportunities, not outcomes. I think if we can communicate that to a broad coalition of folks here in Texas, of every different background, from all over, and I think the shared common goal, though, of hoping that their kids can do better than they're doing, I think not only will I be successful in the primary, but we will be successful in the general election as well.I've got the experience. I know what to do. I know what we can do to address what's going on, both in our state and the country. And I'm going to go out there and make sure that Texans know that. I've been holding town halls all around the state and go into, like I said, working in any place I can find that they'll let me come work and do a shift so I can talk to folks. I really enjoy that. And I think this is not only how I want to make sure we campaign here, but also how I want to serve, which is what the focus on what ordinary and hardworking people are going through, what they're talking about when they sit at their kitchen table at night. Those are the same conversations my mom and I had, and I want to be somebody who they think when they're sitting there, \"Well, we know one thing. We know Colin's on our side.\"You also have Terry Virts in the race and there's speculation that Jasmine Crockett or Beto O'Rourke might get in. Are you worried that this could turn into a messy primary that ultimately hurts Democrats' chances of flipping the seat?I think we all have to do everything that we can in a moment like this. I'm focused on what I'm doing, and I know why I'm doing it. I think that I've shown that not only can I win tough races, and I flipped a seat in Congress, [it was] held by Republican for 22 years. Nobody thought that we were going to beat him [Pete Sessions] when I ran in 2018. He'd been unopposed in the previous election and then hung onto that seat in tough reelections. Hundreds of millions of dollars spent against me in the last election and still overperformed our ticket significantly. I think I know what I bring to the table, but I also understand that everybody's looking for how they can serve and how they fight in this time, and I appreciate that.You mentioned gerrymandering earlier. Texas has been in the spotlight specifically because of that issue. How do you feel about the Texas Democrats' response to that moment? Do you think their pushback was effective?I think it was effective in that it gave time for the discussion to both be had in Texas, and I was holding a bunch of town halls talking about this, and folks were following it very closely. Much of my voting rights career, I was sometimes wondering, when are folks going to get angry about these laws? When are we going to see that breakthrough, the folks tie together the fact that they're trying to stop you from voting so that then when they rigged the elections, that then rigged the economy against you. And I think this gave time for us to have that discussion and for folks to be like, \"Hey listen, wait a second, they're doing what?\"Gerrymandering is not something that I think many people before this election cycle could probably give you a lot of detail on, but now they could, because they've been following this so closely. And at all my town halls, people talk about it and they raise it on their own. So I think it helped in that regard. I think it also galvanized other states to say, \"Okay well then we're gonna have to respond to this. We're not gonna let you rig the election now.\"As a voting rights lawyer I hate gerrymandering, period, and I think the goal has to be to ban it nationwide, and I've passed legislation in the House to do that. We couldn't get it to the Senate unfortunately, but we can require every state to have non-partisan independent commissions to draw their districts so there's no reason we shouldn't have that. What we need to do though, of course, is just pass that legislation. But in order to do that, we can't let them rig the elections to prevent us from doing that, if that makes sense.So I think the end goal here has to be to respond and to fight in order to end gerrymandering, period. And regardless of party, and I do talk to a number of Republicans about this, folks don't think it's right that elected officials are picking their voters. I think it should be the other way around.I think this is also something that, you know, it's good politics that we should be talking about, but this is inherently corrupt, and this is inherently about silencing voices, particularly Black and brown voices.Putting on your legal hat as a lawyer, do you anticipate that the courts may overturn this or do you think it's gonna be upheld eventually?It's tough to say. I think that a fair ruling would find this to be a racial gerrymander, which is still impermissible. Even the Supreme Court has left in place that you cannot discriminate racially in the drawing of districts, and I think this would meet that threshold in my professional opinion. Now, am I confident that the Fifth Circuit and the Supreme Court will act in a timely manner? That's where I'm worried. I do worry about the timing, about whether or not this can be fully heard in time, and also whether or [not] they'll just find a way to get out of doing what I think is a straightforward approach to this.This is to me from the very beginning from the genesis of this with the president basically saying this is what I want, give me five seats. Then the DOJ sending a letter saying you have to use race in your redistricting and you need to redraw your districts, while at the same time the state of Texas in court was saying that they were not using race as how they drew their districts then they just reversed themselves immediately in court. And now they're doing this. I think from the very beginning this has shown that this is a deeply cynical, deeply discriminatory effort to take away voting power from Black and brown folks here in Texas.Every district that was targeted was a Black or brown district. And folks should know that, that we're talking about messing with [former Representative] Barbara Jordan's district, which they did, that we are talking about messing with historic districts, that folks died in order to get this representation. And I take it very seriously. I hope the courts do as well.In Texas, gun rights and also the oil industry are very important issues to the state and to many people in the state. But at the national level, Democrats generally want more restrictions on guns. They're also pushing to reduce fossil fuels. How do you balance that as a Democrat in Texas? Just to be honest with you, I'm not running for the national party, and I never have seen myself that way. I'm a Texan first, and we have a long tradition of that here in Texas, of folks who actually, prior to this recent generation of leaders that we've had who I think have been complete followers, but who were seen as folks who looked out for Texas first and who understood our state, understood our culture, and wanted to respect that.I grew up around guns here in Texas. I grew up going to camp where we had a rifle range, and I was shooting guns when I was seven years old. When I go out of the state and talk to other folks about that, I understand that's not what they're doing in every state, but that's what we were doing. And I think that we can have a responsible culture of gun ownership. That's what had for much of my life growing up. I think what we've gotten away from is that sense of responsibility and we've got into this sort of just bizarre ideology, that to me is completely alien to the Texas that I know and to the Texas gun owners who I grew up around.When it comes to oil and gas, I mean we're the number one energy state in the country and we always will be. But for us, I think it's more that we're an energy state, in every sense, we're the number one wind energy state as well, the number two solar energy state, and for us nuclear is a big part of our mix as well. For us, we have a very diverse energy economy and one that is incredibly important for working people here. There are hundreds of thousands of good-paying jobs for working folks in Texas directly tied to our energy industry, but we also can use that and use our preeminence to try and do it in the right way.When it comes to things like capturing methane, which we focused on in the Inflation Reduction Act that I worked on, that's important. But it's also something that the energy companies themselves want to be doing. So we have incentives in that bill to try and say you need to be capturing this methane. It is a harmful greenhouse gas, but it's something that if you capture it correctly, then it'll be a benefit to you as a company. So we can balance these things, but my interest is always gonna be how can I help Texans first? And I think if you're running in Texas, that has to be your focus.Right now, Democrats are historically unpopular, according to a lot of polling, and many voters have just generally seen Democrats in Congress as weak and ineffective. If you get to the Senate, how specifically would you work with Democrats to deal with the Trump administration and the Republicans in DC?I think we've been here before. When I ran for Congress in 2018, there were a lot of similar feelings. And a lot the folks who, like me, who ran in that election, it was the first time we'd ever run for office. And whether it's me or Elissa Slotkin or Andy Kim or Abigail Spanberger, we were all friends. We were all part of the same class. And I think many of us didn't see ourselves as politicians. We wanted to serve our communities. I didn't just run anywhere. I ran in the district where I was born and raised. The hospital where I was born was in my district, the high school that I went to was in my district. So it was personal and I felt like the people who I grew up around were not being served by their member of Congress. So once we got to Washington, then we tried as much as we could to try and shake it up. I think you see many of the folks who've been trying and rattling the cages as much as possible have been folks who were part of that effort and who many of us, we still don't, and I certainly don't see myself—as politicians we see ourselves as public servants. Who are trying our best to fight for the country that we love and for the states that we love. And so part of that is being able to work with anybody if you know it's in the interest of your community.My proudest accomplishment in Congress was opening a VA hospital in Garland, which is a city in my district. It was a hospital that had closed down, a private hospital by Baylor Scott & White that we worked on for a year with the Trump administration to get donated to the VA. It was a $400 million facility, created 5,000 jobs, is helping us serve our veterans and also creating an economic driver for the city of Garland. That's working with the Trump administration, but we also have to stand up for the rights that we know are so important. I think we can do both of those things, but I think it has to be from a perspective and the focus has to not just be on the party or things like that. It has to be on people that you're trying to serve. I think when you keep that as your main focus, I think it's better politics, but I also think it leads to better policy. That when you're in the office, then you're doing things for the right reason. That you're not corruptible.I never took a single dime of corporate PAC money in my time in Congress because I didn't want anyone to think that I was making a decision based on some kind of donation. Never traded stocks. I didn't want anyone to think that I was trying to profit off my position. I was there to try and serve. That's what I want to do in the Senate as well.Turning to a more somber note, it's been just over a week since the assassination of Charlie Kirk. Unfortunately, political violence has become quite common in the past few years. How do you think Democrats or lawmakers in general should be responding in this moment?I think it's deeply personal as a dad and a husband. My first thoughts were about Charlie Kirk's family, just how horrific it was for his wife, for his children. Nobody deserves that. And this should never happen in our politics. We have to speak, I think with a unified voice in rejecting it. I think we all have a role to play. I try to, and I try and play my role in this, in keeping our political discussions, our political debates, at a level of respect and decency, to where when that fight is over folks can understand that as John Lewis used to tell us when I started with him in Congress, that we might have come here on different ships but we're in the same boat now and we are all Americans. This is our house. It's the American house. We live here together, and we have to find a way to remember that. And we have to have leaders, quite honestly, who will remind us of that. We have to have leaders who will try to bring us together around some of our shared values.We will have fights. We've always had fights. That's the nature of a democracy. For 250 years, we have been having a lot of fights. From the very beginning, we were. And we will continue to. But the way we conduct ourselves in those fights is as important as the fights themselves. And I've always tried to conduct myself in a way, that I think the folks can see, that I have a fundamental respect not only for people I'm running against, but for the process of democracy itself. And so I refuse to accept that there's nothing that we can do about this or that we have to give in to a period of increased violence. I reject that outright.I think we all have a role to play, including folks who are sitting there on their phones and in your own personal lives, that as you're having these discussions yourself, to be a part of the solution instead of part of a problem. And get out there and talk to ordinary folks, get out there and be a part of a vibrant discussion that I think we need to be having instead of being somebody who is contributing to some of the divisions.Trump and a lot of Republicans seem to be using this moment to push for a crackdown on left-wing groups or leftist ideology. There was also the cancelation of Jimmy Kimmel's show this week, which got a lot of attention. How should Democrats be responding to those actions from the administration and many Republicans?I think it's very simple. We have to stand up for the Constitution. I feel this very strongly, that this is not about the individual being targeted. It never has been. In our entire history, it's never been about the person who's being targeted and their speech. It's always been about that we as a country have committed ourselves to the idea of free speech. That's always the ground that we should defend, and regardless of who it is, or often times even what they said. Throughout our history we've stood up for this idea that I may disagree with everything you said, but I'll fight to the death for your right to say it and that's part of having a vibrant democracy. So to me as we fight this, we fight right now on the grounds that every American is infused with, that in this democracy we have freedom of speech and in this country we don't have to worry that you cannot criticize the administration. That here in the United States, we're the land of the free and the home of the brave. And that we should be civil in our discourse, but we're not always going to see that. And those rights are not negotiable.To me, I think that this is something that I feel very, very strongly about. That when you see one right being taken away, every other right is always in danger as well. And we have to fight, I think really hard, to make sure we adhere ourselves to the demands of our Constitution, which is that we do protect freedom of speech, that we have a culture and a belief in vigorous debate, and that sometimes we're going to disagree strongly, but that we're never going to allow ourselves to have a government coming down, cracking down on people for what they're saying. I think that's the grounds we have to fight on. I believe that that's what most people think. And I believe that any overreach is not what people want.Some folks on the right are trying to use this moment to target the transgender community, which has been an ongoing issue. Texas has passed legislation targeting that community. And since the election, there's been this sense that some Democrats have sort of pivoted a bit on this issue, tried to moderate a bit, thinking maybe it contributed to the loss in 2024. How do you view this issue of transgender rights and the various discussions surrounding that?I think we have to have a very clear distinction here, which is that we're against discrimination of any kind. I'm a civil rights lawyer. I believe that we always have to ensure that folks are not discriminated against for who they are, how they identify, who they love, how they pray, that that should be and is the law of the land. And we should ensure that and stand up for those values for everyone. To me, that is, I think, very clear. And I feel like what we've often seen is that Republicans have used these kinds of attacks to then on the other side, you pick working people's pockets while they're talking about something, they're actually on the side reaching in their pocket and taking away their health care, raising their cost-of-living, making this to be a more expensive Christmas, more expensive to have quesadillas, more to get your kid a birthday present. And so that I think we have to also make sure folks know is that we're against discrimination. We also, let's talk about what they're doing with the positions that they have, which is to pick your pocket and to make sure that you can get ahead. Let's not be distracted. Let's keep our focus on what they are doing and what they doing to hurt you and your family.Another big issue that's been causing tensions within the Democratic Party is the issue of the Gaza war. What is your position on how the U.S. should be responding to that? Have you or would you accept money from AIPAC (American Israel Public Affairs Committee)? Some Democrats are swearing it off.I think what's happening in Israel, Gaza and the West Bank is a tragedy, and we need to have this conflict end as quickly as possible for the hostages to come home. One of the most important roles is what comes next. And to me that has to be maintaining and building towards two independent states, a secure, safe, democratic, and Jewish Israeli state next to an independent and sovereign Palestinian state. That to me has always been U.S. policy, but also in some ways, because of how tragic this period has been, that presents almost a time to reassess as to whether or not this is something that we think we can do. And to me, this is still the only viable option going forward.With regards to things like AIPAC, listen, they endorsed Ted Cruz in the last election. They've endorsed John Cornyn in this election. I'm not expecting—my job is to talk to Texans about what I think is in our national interest, what I can do to try and bring this conflict to an end, but also to create a lasting peace. I've worked on this in Congress, I was on the Foreign Affairs Committee. I've told Bibi Netanyahu to his face that I think he's doing the wrong thing. I think part of supporting Israel, which I do, is supporting them in saying when they're doing something that you think is not in their interest, or in our interest, or in the regional interest. And that's what I think is going on right now. We have to bring this conflict to an end, and I think we have a productive role in ensuring that what comes next and the day after has to be something that's moving us back towards a two-state solution instead of away from it.Those were my main questions, but I always just like to ask, what is something interesting or unique about yourself that you think is not very well known and might surprise voters?Growing up, I was kind of a computer nerd, but I could never afford to buy a computer. I just started building them from kind of like spare parts kind of. And when I was in college, I even had a computer repair business that I created while I was playing football. I didn't make much money, but people kept asking me to fix their computers. And so I would just do it. And I was like, well, maybe I should get a little bit of money for it. And I want to teach my kids about building computers because I find it to be just relaxing, but also really interesting. And that's probably something that most folks didn't know about me.","summary":"Running for Senate, the former NFL linebacker is attempting, once again, to do what no Democrat has done in Texas in more than 30 years—win a statewide race.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/exclusive-colin-allred-free-speech-corruption-how-win-texas-2133044","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2725990/exclusive-colin-allred.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=676f4e66902582791e4373121b63c0d5","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-21 09:00:04","author":"Jason Lemon","authors":["Jason Lemon"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.123},{"id":362209436,"title":"Editorial: Buttigieg to Dems: Identity politics have to go","text":"Former Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg dropped a bombshell on Democrats last week, one lost in the chaotic news cycle following Charlie Kirk’s assassination.\n\nHe was responding to a passage in former Vice President Kamala Harris’ forthcoming book “107 Days” in which she said Buttigieg was her first choice for a running mate and “would have been an ideal partner — if I were a straight white man.”\n\n“My experience in politics has been that the way that you earn trust with voters is based mostly on what they think you’re going to do for their lives, not on categories,” Buttigieg said before a ribbon cutting ceremony at the Monroe County Democratic Party headquarters in Indiana, according to Politico.\n\nConservatives have been decrying identity politics for years, and liberals have been just as vigorously espousing them as key to winning races.\n\nButtigieg cited former President Barack Obama winning the state in 2008 and his own two terms as mayor of South Bend, Indiana, as evidence of his approach.\n\n“You just have to go to voters with what you think you can do for them,” he said. “Politics is about the results we can get for people and not about these other things.”\n\nThat’s radical thinking in Democratic circles, many of whom blamed Harris’ loss to Donald Trump on anything but her policies.\n\nObama said he was speaking to Black men in particular when he suggested some “aren’t feeling the idea of having a woman as president.” Others pointed the misogyny finger at Latino men.\n\nPundits went all in on sexism and racism tipping the scale in Trump’s favor after last November’s election.\n\nThe problem is, identity politics don’t matter as much to voters as they do to campaigns.\n\nA Pew Research Center poll released last year asked Americans how important it is that a woman be elected president in their lifetime, and found that only 18% of U.S. adults said this is extremely or very important to them. Some 64% said it is not too important or not at all so, or that the president’s gender doesn’t matter.\n\nDemocrats missed the memo.\n\n“But we were already asking a lot of America: to accept a woman, a Black woman, a Black woman married to a Jewish man. Part of me wanted to say, Screw it, let’s just do it. But knowing what was at stake, it was too big of a risk,” Harris wrote of rejecting Buttigieg.\n\nThe real risk was believing voters would check the box for Harris because of who she was, not what she was promoting, which was essentially four more years of the very Biden policies the electorate was rejecting.\n\nAll this is more than just a thorough look in the rear-view. Both Harris and Buttigieg are scoping out presidential bids in 2028. Buttigieg has proven an effective communicator, a big plus for the party.\n\nCommunication has never been Harris’ strong suit.\n\nThis is more than just a cautionary tale for Democrats who want to win races. It should be a wake-up call for candidates to listen to what Americans want, what they’re worried about, and what they hope their futures will look like.\n\nWe want solutions to America’s problems, and a clear path forward for a prosperous, safe country for all citizens. And we’ll vote for whoever makes the best case for delivering on those promises, no matter who they are.","summary":"“You just have to go to voters with what you think you can do for them.

The administration is attacking critics and using fear as a weapon to silence anyone who would speak out. \n\n'Media corporations - from television networks to newspapers - are capitulating to these threats. We cannot dare to be silent or complacent in the face of this frontal assault on free speech. We, the People, deserve better.' \n\nBut critics were quick to call out Harris for a glaring contradiction pointing to her September 2019 tweet in which she demanded the suspension of President Donald Trump's Twitter account during his first term in office. \n\n'Let's be honest, @realDonaldTrump's Twitter account should be suspended,' Harris wrote at the time. 'It's a matter of corporate responsibility. Twitter should be held accountable and shut down that site. It is a matter of safety.'\n\nThe post is a classic example in what many are calling a stunning reversal from the left. A movement once proud of silencing conservatives is now crying foul when one of their own is muzzled. \n\nObama, known for picking his political battles carefully since leaving office, also jumped into the fray slamming the Trump administration for allegedly strong-arming media companies into silencing dissenting voices.\n\n'After years of complaining about cancel culture,' Obama wrote on BlueSky, 'the current administration has taken it to a new and dangerous level by routinely threatening regulatory action against media companies unless they muzzle or fire reporters and commentators it doesn't like.'\n\n'This is precisely the kind of government coercion that the First Amendment was designed to prevent,' he continued. 'And media companies need to start standing up rather than capitulating to it.'\n\nObama linked to a New York Times piece by columnist David French defending the First Amendment. \n\n'This commentary offers a clear, powerful statement of why freedom of speech is at the heart of democracy and must be defended - whether the speaker is Charlie Kirk or Jimmy Kimmel, MAGA supporters or MAGA opponents.' \n\nYet during his presidency, his administration was accused of surveilling journalists, weaponizing the IRS, and cheering the de-platforming of conservative commentators.\n\nIt's not the first time Democrats have walked the fine line between defending speech and restricting it. \n\nDuring the Biden administration, White House aides were found to have pressured Twitter and Facebook to remove anti-vaccine content, a form of government influence that conservatives labeled 'jawboning.'\n\nNow, under Trump's return to the White House, the roles appear reversed.\n\nConservatives once decrying cancel culture are now embracing what they call 'consequence culture' with liberals are alarmed at the very tools they helped create.\n\nDeputy White House Chief of Staff Taylor Budowich dismissed the backlash entirely.\n\n'Free speech is alive & well. Kimmel can head down to Sunset Blvd & maybe even attract a bigger audience than his show did,' Budowich wrote. 'Bad jokes & bad TV are bad for biz. ABC is no longer paralyzed in fear by the woke mob.'\n\n'Welcome to Consequence Culture,' he added.\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom accused the Trump administration of fascism.\n\n'There is no such thing as free speech under Donald Trump's reign,' Newsom tweeted. \n\nAnd yet, just five years ago, it was Newsom, Obama, and Harris who stood by or actively cheered as Trump, Charlie Kirk, and others were silenced by Big Tech platforms under Democratic pressure.\n\nThe backlash from Democrats comes as Kimmel's show was abruptly pulled from the airwaves following his monologue criticizing Republicans for politicizing Charlie Kirk's death. \n\n'The MAGA gang is desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them,' Kimmel said. 'And doing everything they can to score political points from it.' \n\nThat line drew furious responses from MAGA-world - and a threat from FCC Chair Carr, who warned ABC of 'regulatory consequences.' Hours later, Jimmy Kimmel was suspended indefinitely. \n\nTrump gloated on Truth Social, calling Kimmel 'ZERO talent.'\n\n'Great News for America,' Trump wrote. 'ABC finally had the courage to do what had to be done.'\n\n'Jimmy Kimmel was fired because he had bad ratings more than anything else, and he said a horrible thing about a great gentleman known as Charlie Kirk,' Trump later told reporters. 'He was fired for lack of talent.'\n\nMeanwhile, his VP, JD Vance, backed the cancellation in harsher terms. \n\n'If you celebrate Charlie Kirk's death, you should not be protected from being fired for being a disgusting person,' Vance told Fox News.\n\n'The First Amendment protects a lot of very ugly speech - but not from consequences.","summary":"Barack Obama and Kamala Harris condemned Jimmy Kimmel's suspension as a 'frontal assault on free speech,' despite having previously supported censorship of conservatives Trump.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15118419/Barack-Obama-Kamala-Harris-free-speech-hypocrisy.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/09/21/04/102317723-0-image-m-34_1758426137592.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/09/21/2433087556761177603/1024x576_MP4_2433087556761177603.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-21 06:36:40","author":"Editor,James Gordon","authors":["Editor","James Gordon"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.296},{"id":362239082,"title":"Disney’s Kimmel suspension shows Trump’s increasing grip over media","text":"LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA, (Reuters) – ABC’s abrupt suspension of talk show host Jimmy Kimmel under pressure from the Federal Communications Commission is the latest demonstration of the power President Donald Trump wields to bend media, entertainment and digital platforms to his will, as he uses political pressure to mute criticism and punish institutions he sees as biased against him.\n\nThe move, which came after Kimmel’s remarks about the accused killer of slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk, has jolted the U.S. media and entertainment industries and intensified free-speech fears as the Trump-appointed FCC chair Brendan Carr threatened to revoke broadcast licenses from stations that carry what he called “garbage.”\n\nMajor media and tech companies are now controlled by Trump supporters or billionaire business leaders who lined up behind Trump during his inauguration, donated to his inaugural fund, or visited the White House bearing gifts. Billionaire GOP donor Larry Ellison’s Oracle is part of a consortium of investors with the inside track to take control of the U.S. operations of the video-sharing platform TikTok.\n\nThis week, the Trump administration announced it had agreed to a framework for a deal with China that would allow the sale of TikTok’s U.S. assets to continue to operate in the U.S.\n\nCompanies such as CBS, Meta Plat-forms META.O, and the editorial pages of the Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times have made editorial or operational changes following Trump’s re-election in ways that lay the groundwork for less adversarial coverage of the president.\n\n“There is a continued lurch to the right throughout much of our major media in the United States right now,” said Victor Pickard, professor of media policy and political economy at the Annenberg School of Communication at University of Pennsylvania. “I expect to see more of this to come. There’s no countervailing force against it.”\n\nThe decision Wednesday night is the second time since Trump’s re-election that ABC parent company Walt Disney DIS.N has taken action in response to on-air comments. In December, ABC News agreed to give $15 million to Trump’s presidential library to settle a lawsuit Trump had filed over remarks that anchor George Stephanopoulos made involving sex abuse claims brought against Trump by writer E. Jean Carroll.\n\n“They’re all terrified,” said Steve Kroft, who was a longtime “60 Minutes” correspondent, specifically citing the nightly broadcast news. “The thing that scares me the most about this administration is this retaliatory mindset, to go after its enemies. And I think they’re clearly going after the news people. That’s the top of their list.”\n\nDisney declined to comment.\n\n“Jimmy Kimmel is free to make whatever bad jokes he wants, but a private company is under no obligation to lose money producing an unpopular show,” said White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson. “Jimmy Kimmel’s terrible product isn’t a free speech problem; it’s a talent problem.”\n\nPressure on traditional media comes after conservatives successfully pushed digital platforms to pare back content moderation which they portrayed as biased.\n\nElon Musk acquired Twitter in 2022, which had banned Trump for “incitement of violence” after the January 6, 2021 riot at the U.S. Capitol, pand promised to restore “free speech” to the platform. Renamed X, Musk eliminated its Trust and Safety team in favor of a system that allows its users to fact-check posts, and restored accounts of conservatives who previously had violated Twitter’s policies.\n\nContent on the platform has become more right-leaning since the acquisition, according to research from Queensland University.\n\nMeta Platforms disbanded its third-party fact-checking program in the United States, changes that affected Facebook, Instagram and Threads.\n\nThe company elected Dana White, a Trump ally and the chief executive of Ultimate Fighting Championship, to its board, and elevated prominent Republican policy executive Joel Kaplan as global affairs head.\n\n“We’ve reached a point where it’s just too many mistakes and too much censorship. It’s time to get back to our roots around free expression,” CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in January.\n\nBeyond broadcast licenses, media mergers involving local broadcasters require the FCC’s blessing. The son of longtime Trump supporter Larry Ellison, David Ellison, helped secure regulatory approval for his company Skydance Media to buy ParamountPSKY.O, with the promise that the CBS network would reflect the “varied ideological perspectives” of American viewers.\n\nPrior to the deal, Paramount paid $16 million to settle a 2024 lawsuit Trump filed over a “60 Minutes” interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris, which he claimed gave a distorted view of his rival for the White House.\n\nThe FCC has said the settlement and regulatory review were unrelated.\n\nLast week, the company announced the appointment of its new ombudsman, Kenneth R. Weinstein, a former president and CEO of the conservative Hudson Institute.\n\nParamount is reported to be in talks to acquire The Free Press and bring founder Bari Weiss into a leadership role at CBS News. The former New York Times opinion writer built a national following by challenging what she views as the illiberal left and “wokism.”\n\nNow Paramount is preparing a bid to acquire Warner Bros DiscoveryWBD.O, home to CNN, while Larry Ellison’s cloud giant Oracle is in play to buy TikTok, which would put a key communication tool that reaches 170 million Americans in the hands of a conservative billionaire.\n\nWhen asked about allegations of a right-leaning shift at CBS, a spokeswoman for parent-company Paramount directed Reuters to CEO David Ellison’s previous comments about the network’s political neutrality. “We’re an entertainment company first,” Ellison has said. “Everyone – left, right, young, old – is its audience. I’m not going to be in the position of making political statements about anything.”\n\nDisney was attempting to find a way to defuse the social media backlash against Kimmel’s comments when the FCC’s Carr turned up the heat.\n\nThe regulator said Kimmel misled viewers about the alleged shooter’s affiliation with Trump’s Make America Great Again movement, and urged local stations to push back, raising the possibility of the FCC revoking the broadcast licenses of local television stations that did not comply.\n\n“We can do this the easy way or the hard way,” Carr said in an interview with conservative podcaster Benny Johnson on Wednesday.\n\nABC pulled Kimmel off the air after Nexstar Media GroupNXST.O, the largest owner of broadcast stations in the U.S., decided to preempt the show in the wake of his comments about Kirk.

Will call back.' \n\nHarris adds pointedly: '(He never did.)'\n\nThe bombshell details, included in an early copy of the book adds fresh fuel to simmering tensions between two of California's most prominent Democrats and underscores the backstage drama that followed Biden's stunning exit from the race.\n\nHarris's memoir, which lands on bookshelves next week, recounts the frenzied 107 days between Biden's exit and her eventual defeat in the general election to Donald Trump. \n\nThe book offers one of the most unfiltered looks yet at Harris's short campaign and her barely veiled frustration with Democrats who hesitated or withheld their support.\n\nShe says she called 'dozens' of Democrats seeking immediate endorsements, knowing the window was short and the media narrative was rapidly forming. \n\nSome, like Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer and Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, initially demurred but ultimately endorsed her. \n\nOf Pritzker, she wrote: 'As governor of Illinois, I'm the convention host. I can't commit.' \n\nAccording to Harris, while others took her calls or got back to her quickly, Newsom never returned hers directly. \n\nInstead, he posted a public endorsement hours later, after Harris had already secured the nomination.\n\nCaught off guard by the revelation, Newsom downplayed the drama on Friday when questioned by reporters during a press event in San Francisco.\n\n'There was an unknown number,' he said. 'Meanwhile, I was on a text chain trying to get in touch with the Biden administration, because I was completely surprised that the president dropped out.' \n\nHe claimed he was hiking at the time, received the message from an 'unknown number', and told his team he would respond later - which he insists he did via text. \n\nHarris's account, however, makes clear that she believes he never followed up with a promised phone call.\n\n'That exact same moment, [I] was working with my team to draft a statement,' Newsom added. 'I assume that's in the book as well.' \n\nHarris never mentions Newsom's eventual endorsement which came hours after the phone call attempt. \n\nInstead, she uses the anecdote to paint a broader picture of selective loyalty and political calculation from within her own party.\n\nAsked on Friday point-blank if he called her back, Newsom waved it off.\n\n'I don't know about accusations,' he said. 'I haven't read the book. So it's hard to even opine about context… it's trivial.' \n\nNewsom backed Biden early in 2024 and was one of his most loyal surrogates, even as whispers swirled about his own aspirations for a presidential run. \n\nWhen Biden stumbled in debates against Trump, Newsom's name was floated as a possible replacement.\n\nBut when Biden finally bowed out, Harris moved fast. She had 107 days to rally support, define her candidacy, and take on Trump. \n\nDuring the Democratic National Convention in Chicago where Harris formally became the nominee, Newsom appeared on Pod Save America and made a veiled jab at how quickly the party coalesced behind her.\n\n'We went through a very open process, a very inclusive process,' he said, sarcastically. 'It was bottom-up. I don't know if you know that. That's what I've been told to say!'\n\nThe remark, while delivered with a smile, was widely interpreted as a dig suggesting that the nomination had been handed to Harris without true deliberation. \n\nIn her memoir, Harris doesn't address the convention joke directly, but the bitterness is apparent in her omission of Newsom's support from her narrative.\n\nHarris has not ruled out another presidential run in 2028. \n\nNewsom, who is term-limited in 2026, has also continued to deny presidential ambitions but it would appear the two California Democrats are on a collision course in the years to come.","summary":"Harris described the moment in her upcoming memoir 107 Days while recalling how she reached out to a number of high profile Democrats seeking their backing.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15119005/Kamala-Harris-Gavin-Newsom-dodged-phonecall.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/09/21/05/102317925-0-image-a-65_1758430109347.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2024/08/24/5102400386864795265/1024x576_MP4_5102400386864795265.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-21 05:28:52","author":"Editor,James Gordon","authors":["Editor","James Gordon"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.458},{"id":362189512,"title":"In the heart of Dahieh: The daring Mossad operation that led to the assassination of Nasrallah","text":"Some Israeli security officials say preparations for the covert pagers operation were simple compared with the planning that went into a different mission, carried out under fire and at grave risk to Mossad operatives. That mission unfolded in September 2023, as Israeli warplanes pounded Hezbollah strongholds in Beirut’s southern suburb of Dahieh. Several operatives slipped into Haret Hreik, a densely built Shiite neighborhood, carrying carefully disguised packages. They knew full well that if Hezbollah men caught them, death was certain. And if the devices in their hands were discovered, Israel’s security would face a devastating blow. The Mossad team crept through narrow alleys, hugging walls, hoping their handler had coordinated with the IDF so the air force would not bomb the very path they were taking. Their destination was a high-rise apartment block. Beneath it sat Hezbollah’s most sensitive secret — the underground bunker serving as its main command headquarters. Intelligence delivered to Unit 8200 and Military Intelligence indicated that Hezbollah’s leader Hassan Nasrallah was scheduled to meet there with Iran’s Quds Force commander in Lebanon, Gen. Abbas Nilforoushan, and Hezbollah’s southern front chief, Ali Karaki, who was viewed as a possible successor to Nasrallah. Only a handful of Hezbollah’s security guards and inner circle knew the bunker even existed. The Mossad operatives were to place their devices at pre-planned points inside the building above the compound. They assessed their chances of survival at no better than 50-50. Even if Hezbollah’s men failed to spot them, they still risked being struck by shrapnel from Israeli bombs raining down nearby. Just hours before setting out, the agents held a tense discussion with their Mossad handler. They said they were prepared for the mission but demanded that the air force halt its heavy bombardments during their infiltration. The handler insisted the opposite: the raids would not only continue but intensify, forcing Hezbollah guards to take cover and giving the agents a chance to reach the bunker. Under the pounding of Israeli bombs, the Mossad team completed its mission. They planted the devices exactly where planned and slipped away undetected. What was hidden in the bunker The equipment they carried sounded like something out of science fiction. Completed in 2022, about a year before Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack, it was designed to allow precision strikes at varying depths underground. The Mossad had sought the technology not only for Lebanon but also for a potential strike on Iran’s nuclear program. The project involved the Defense Ministry’s weapons development unit, intelligence and technology specialists, the air force, and defense companies Rafael and Elbit. Together they developed guidance systems and penetrating warheads for Israel’s bombs, ensuring they could strike precisely in rocky terrain. That precision was essential. Even a one-meter deviation could mean a bomb striking beside — rather than into — a tunnel. In that case, those inside might survive with only injuries. On Sept. 27, 2023, at 6:20 p.m., 10 Israeli fighter jets dropped 83 one-ton bombs on the target. The strike involved F-15I Ra’am jets from Squadron 69, known as the Hammers, and F-16I Sufa jets. The bombs, U.S.-made BLU-109 bunker busters known in Israel as heavy hail, carried both GPS guidance and the specialized targeting system placed earlier by Mossad. Originally, the air force planned to use about half that number of bombs. But then–Defense Minister Yoav Gallant insisted the payload be doubled to ensure Nasrallah’s death. The strike killed Nasrallah, Karaki, Nilforoushan and some 300 others, mostly Hezbollah terrorists who were present. Israeli officials said the assassination marked the effective collapse of Hezbollah’s central command. Hezbollah retaliated with a barrage of rockets, drones and anti-tank missiles, naming its counteroffensive Operation Khaybar, after a 7th-century Muslim victory over Jewish tribes in Arabia. The group’s Shura Council quickly appointed Hashem Safieddine, head of its executive council, as Nasrallah’s replacement. But on Oct. 4, 2024 — just one week later — he too was killed in an Israeli strike using the same methods. Naim Qassem, Hezbollah’s deputy leader, then took over. The letter from Mossad’s chief The success against Hezbollah was the result of both Israeli strategic decisions and critical mistakes made by Nasrallah after Oct. 7. But it almost did not happen. After Hamas’ attack, Gallant and then–Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi pressed for an immediate assault on Hezbollah to neutralize its arsenal of more than 130,000 rockets and drones. At the time, Hamas’ forces inside Gaza had been pushed back, while Hezbollah posed the greater long-term threat. But Mossad director David Barnea, joined by former IDF chiefs Benny Gantz and Gadi Eisenkot, argued Israel must first deal with Hamas, which still held 251 hostages and was firing rockets daily. They warned that striking Hezbollah could trigger direct Iranian involvement and a regional war. The Biden administration also urged restraint. Netanyahu ultimately canceled a strike on Hezbollah already in motion, with Israeli jets recalled at the last moment. Ten months later, in August 2024, Barnea sent Netanyahu a letter urging a full offensive in Lebanon before the November U.S. presidential election. He argued both President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump would back Israel during campaign season, while after the vote — especially if Vice President Kamala Harris won — support might be weaker. Netanyahu approved the plan, shifting forces from Gaza to the north in September. Israel began dismantling Hezbollah’s senior command in July 2024. Fuad Shukr, Nasrallah’s top military adviser, was killed in late July, depriving Nasrallah of his main strategist. Israel then assassinated Hezbollah commanders one by one. By the time of Operation New Order, Hezbollah’s leadership was reeling. The IDF also crippled Hezbollah’s battlefield capabilities, systematically striking anti-tank squads and rocket launchers, and in mid-September carried out the pagers operation, which disabled Hezbollah communications and caused mass casualties among its terrorists. Israeli intelligence officials said Nasrallah failed to grasp the scale of Israel’s campaign. He still believed in his equation — that Israel would avoid escalation for fear of heavy losses. His conviction that Israel lacked the resolve for total war proved to be his fatal miscalculation. Even with intelligence pointing to Nasrallah’s planned meeting in the bunker, Israeli leaders remained divided. Gallant and Halevi favored alerting Washington to avoid escalation with Syria, Iran and beyond. Barnea and others argued Israel must act immediately, without U.S. coordination. Netanyahu initially hesitated. Then, while en route to the United Nations General Assembly, he received updated intelligence suggesting the opportunity might not return. He gave the order mid-flight. After a final phone consultation from his hotel in New York, the green light was given. The deception that brought down Nasrallah Another decisive factor was deception. Even after Mossad and the IDF crippled Hezbollah’s communications on Sept. 17-18, Nasrallah did not realize Israel had launched a total offensive. Israel staged its campaign in phases — first eliminating Shukr in July, then disabling communications in September, then striking rocket stockpiles in Operation Northern Arrows. Nasrallah, clinging to his spider web theory that Israel was weak-willed despite military strength, assumed Israel would not dare target him personally. But Oct. 7 had altered Israel’s national mindset. Security officials said the country’s post-Holocaust resolve — the instinct of “never again” — proved stronger than Nasrallah expected. Nasrallah’s death marked a turning point, but Israeli officials say Hezbollah remains a serious threat. Naim Qassem, its new leader, is seen as capable if less charismatic. The group has lost support among Lebanon’s Shiite population, which suffered from Israel’s strikes, and faces pressure to disarm. Yet Hezbollah retains precision rockets and drones north of the Litani River. Israeli officials warn the group still has the ability to strike Israel and destabilize Lebanon. “The story of Nasrallah has ended,” one senior intelligence officer said. “But the story of Hezbollah has not.”","summary":"Israeli spies infiltrated the Hezbollah stronghold in Beirut under fire, planting devices that guided airstrikes that killed Hassan Nasrallah, top commanders and hundreds of fighters, in an operation that reshaped the war in Lebanon","url":"https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/byb2qltieg","image":"https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/09/29/r1bTjzKL0A/r1bTjzKL0A_0_0_3000_2000_0_large.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-21 04:33:02","author":"Ron Ben-Yishai","authors":["Ron Ben-Yishai"],"language":"en","source_country":"il","sentiment":-0.148},{"id":362190878,"title":"‘Tidal wave of problems’: With harvest here, Trump’s trade war pushes some US farmers to the brink","text":"(CNN) — Farmers across the country are issuing increasingly urgent warnings that they’ll face grim consequences if they don’t get help selling this year’s bumper crop that many have begun harvesting.\n\nTrade deals many had hoped would quickly emerge after President Donald Trump slapped tariffs on some of the United States’ biggest agricultural customers haven’t come. A farm bailout is no sure thing on Capitol Hill. And farmers — many of whom voted for Trump — say time is running out.\n\n“It just seems like things have stalled all summer long,” said Brian Warpup, who grows corn and soybeans on his 3,900-acre farm in northeastern Indiana. “We’re always hopeful that those negotiations are moving forward, but yet with harvest here, patience may be running thin.”\n\nAcross the US, farmers describe increasingly dire circumstances stemming from a confluence of factors — trade wars, Trump’s immigration crackdown, inflation and high interest rates.\n\nThough the challenges vary in different parts of the country, farmers in some cases, particularly on the West Coast, are struggling to find labor to pick their harvest. Others, especially in the Midwest, said they can’t sell what they’ve produced. And many are scrambling to find storage.\n\nIt’s led to pressures reminiscent of the trade wars from Trump’s first administration, when the federal government spent billions on bailouts to farmers.\n\nThe world’s biggest soybean buyer, China, is so far this year refusing to purchase American soybeans — a critical export that the US Department of Agriculture said was worth nearly $25 billion last year — turning instead to Brazil as part of Beijing’s response to the tariffs Trump imposed on Chinese goods in February.\n\nThat standoff has added to challenges farmers already faced entering the season: Prices of commodities are low compared to 2022 peaks, while prices for fertilizer, seeds and equipment are all up. High interest rates are exacerbating the financial squeeze.\n\nWhat soybeans farmers can’t sell must be stored — and many say they’re short on grain bins. Warpup said he is rushing to sell corn that he’d typically store until spring to create room for more soybeans. Others could face even more costs as they pay for grain elevator storage.\n\nRyan Frieders, a corn and soybean farmer in Illinois, said the storage concerns are “like a tidal wave of problems coming towards Illinois.”\n\nFarm bankruptcies could rise. They were up 55% last year, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation. Ryan Loy, an extension economist for the University of Arkansas Division of Agriculture who tracks farm bankruptcies, said in July that farm bankruptcies were up again in the first quarter of 2025.\n\n“It’s going to mean that there’s going to be farmers that are so far at the end of their rope, not able to meet their financial obligations,” said Caleb Ragland, a Kentucky soybean farmer and the president of the American Soybean Association, who has voted for Trump in every presidential election since 2016.\n\nCDC data shows farmers already face higher suicide rates than the rest of the general population, something that Ragland says could unfortunately rear its head under the current situation. “They’re going to see farmers that choose to take their own lives,” Ragland said.\n\n‘We call it farmageddon’\n\nMany farmers are looking to Washington — and Trump, who they overwhelmingly supported in last year’s election — for solutions.\n\nTrump officials led by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent met this week with a Chinese delegation for trade talks in Madrid, Spain, though it’s not clear if the sides neared a deal that could lead to Chinese soybean purchases. Trump seemingly acknowledged the problem in a Truth Social post last month where he said he hoped China would “quickly quadruple its soybean orders.”\n\nTrump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act includes a $59 billion increase in spending over the next decade on farm safety net enhancements, as well as tax breaks for equipment. But congressional aides say those funding boosts won’t take effect until next year’s crop — and many farmers said they need more immediate assistance.\n\n“This is not your ordinary farm crisis. We call it ‘farmageddon,’ and it’s really a tough time,” said Joe Jennings, the chief executive officer of Daitaas Holdings, a Memphis, Tennessee-based farm tech and software company.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, aides say there are discussions underway between lawmakers and Trump officials about helping farmers. The 2018 Farm Bill, extended twice, is set to expire September 30, though a new version of the legislation does not appear close to being finalized.\n\nSenate Agriculture Chairman John Boozman has said “everything is on the table” to try to address the problem. “Our ongoing, constant efforts to gather farmers’ feedback have always proved tremendously helpful as we make clear to the administration and colleagues in Congress how serious the situation is in rural America,” the Arkansas Republican said in a statement to CNN.\n\nTurning tariffs into bailouts\n\nLawmakers have floated some out-of-the-box fixes, too. House Agriculture Chairman Glenn “GT” Thompson suggested recently in an interview with trade publication Agri-Pulse there could be other ways for the government to step in, including using revenue collected from tariffs to help farmers.\n\nBut Democratic congressional aides say it’s not clear how such a plan would work, and it would likely need congressional approval. One path to helping farmers in financial need is the USDA’s Commodity Credit Corporation, a program that allows the government to help make up losses for farmers. The problem, the aides said, is that taking such a step would require the administration to acknowledge its trade policies are hurting farmers.\n\nCongressional Democrats have argued that the quickest path to helping farmers is for Trump to end his trade war with China.\n\n“Our farmers have spent generations building these export markets, only to have them closed off by haphazard tariffs,” Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, the top Democrat on the Senate Agriculture Committee, told CNN in a statement. “We learned from the trade war during the President’s first term that these markets don’t come back overnight.”\n\nCongressional Republicans have mostly avoided criticizing Trump’s trade war with China, and the House voted this past week for a provision that restricts Congress’ power to challenge Trump’s tariffs until next March.\n\nBut the problem is getting too big to ignore.\n\n“Representing an Ag state, this has very direct consequences, particularly with regard to Asia because that’s such a big market — 60% of South Dakota soybeans are exported and mostly to China, and that market is now shut down,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune said in an interview last week with Punchbowl News. “So, we’re going to have some real issues in farm country with regard to trade and markets more generally.”\n\n‘Hush money to keep them sedated’\n\nAmerican farmers experienced the rockiness from American trade wars during Trump’s first term, too.\n\nIn 2018 and 2019, the first Trump administration paid billions to farmers who were hurt by trade wars the president had started. It was “hush money to keep them sedated,” said Chris Gibbs, an Ohio farmer who previously was the Shelby County Republican chairman and voted for Trump in 2016, but has switched parties and is now the county Democratic chairman.\n\nStill, in the 2024 election, farmers overwhelmingly backed Trump. He won rural voters by 40 percentage points, a Pew Research Center survey found.\n\nGibbs pointed to Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins’ repeated promises that a “golden age of American agriculture” is coming.\n\n“Well, farmers can’t wait any longer,” he said. “They’re squeezed on cash flow. They’re having trouble renewing loans — commodity loans. We’re in a mess — a cash flow mess. And farmers aren’t going to be able to pay the bills. So the administration needs to find some solutions.”\n\nHe said that leaving farmers begging for a bailout is antithetical to an industry that is at the core of America’s identity.\n\nFarmers, Gibbs said, “are independent people. They are proud people. And the worst thing that they want to do is to come to the government for a bailout. Yet here we are once again.”\n\nThe Purdue University-CME Group Ag Economy Barometer Index, a monthly survey that measures farmer sentiment, found last month that America’s farmers — for the third consecutive month — feel less optimistic about the future of the agricultural economy, after that survey found farmer sentiment at a four-year high in May. That four-year high was driven in part by optimism that US agricultural exports would increase in the coming years.\n\nThe August survey found a sharp split between livestock producers, who are not seeing the same dramatic price drops and market closures, and crop operations.\n\nEric Euken, a seventh-generation farmer in western Iowa with 750 acres of corn and 600 acres of soybeans, said pigs and cattle are making up for what he is losing on corn and soybeans this year.\n\nBut, Euken said: “We don’t know what’s happening next from day to day.”\n\nEuken, who said he voted for Trump over former Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024, but didn’t vote for Trump in 2020, said while he knew tariffs were coming, he “didn’t anticipate it being as bad as it is.”\n\n“It is a tough situation right now with the lack of markets that we have, or places to market our crop,” Euken said. “And it’s kind of the government that put us in that situation. So I hate to pin it on the American taxpayer, but if they want us to survive, we are going to need some help.”\n\nStill, he said, he isn’t sure Trump is willing to bail out farmers a second time — because to the term-limited Trump, he said, “it doesn’t matter anymore.”\n\n“The last time when we had bailouts, it was to his benefit to bail us out for future votes,” Euken said. “Buying a future vote is not going to help him one bit.”\n\nThe-CNN-Wire™ & © 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

We’re going to take him off the air, so ABC cannot broadcast anymore … He threatens it.”\n\nFCC Chairman Brendan Carr joined Fox News’ Sean Hannity on Sept. 17, the day the suspension was announced, and defended the move.\n\n“Broadcasters are different than any other form of communication,” Carr said, pointing to affiliate groups like Nexstar and Sinclair that announced they would no longer carry “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” \n\nHe argued that local stations acted appropriately, saying they were “standing up to serve the interests of their community.” \n\n“Over the years, the FCC walked away from enforcing that public interest obligation,” Carr said. \n\n“I don’t think we’re better off as a country for it.”\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News on Saturday that the decision to “fire Jimmy Kimmel and to cancel his show came from executives at ABC.”\n\n“That has now been reported,” Leavitt said. \n\n“And I can assure you it did not come from the White House and there was no pressure given from the president of the United States.” \n\nThe Biden-Harris administration has seen its share of censorship controversies, particularly in its interactions with social media companies during the COVID-19 pandemic. \n\nDuring a 2021 press conference, then-White House press secretary Jen Psaki said that the administration was “flagging problematic posts for Facebook that spread disinformation.”\n\nIn August 2024, just ahead of the presidential election, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg admitted in a letter that the Biden-Harris administration pressured Facebook to censor Americans.\n\nZuckerberg made the admission in a letter to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, more than a year after providing the committee with thousands of documents as part of its investigation into content moderation on online platforms.","summary":"Elon Musk took to X to highlight Kamala Harris's tweets over the Jimmy Kimmel controversy and Trump being suspended from the platform.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/09/20/us-news/elon-musk-resurfaces-kamala-harris-tweet-calling-for-trump-to-be-suspended-from-x-in-2019-amid-kimmel-drama/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/111824701.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/Y3L9dLTt-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-21 01:22:42","author":"Fox News","authors":["Fox News"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":0.056},{"id":362172096,"title":"5 brilliantly barbed cartoons about free speech","text":"SUBSCRIBE & SAVE\n\nLess than $3 per week\n\nView Profile\n\nThe Explainer\n\nTalking Points\n\nThe Week Recommends\n\nNewsletters\n\nFrom the Magazine\n\nThe Week Junior\n\nFood & Drink\n\nPersonal Finance\n\nAll Categories \n\nNewsletter sign up\n\nPolitical Cartoons\n\n5 brilliantly barbed cartoons about free speech\n\nArtists take on who gets to speak, the definition of hate speech, and more\n\nNewsletter sign up\n\nThe Week US \n\n21 September 2025\n\n(Image credit: Jack Ohman / Copyright 2025 Tribune Content Agency)\n\n(Image credit: Dave Whamond / Copyright 2025 Cagle Cartoons, Inc.)\n\n(Image credit: John Deering / Copyright 2025 Creators Syndicate)\n\n(Image credit: John Darkow / Copyright 2025 Cagle Cartoons, Inc.)\n\n(Image credit: Bill Bramhall / Copyright 2025 Tribune Content Agency)\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox\nA free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nEscape your echo chamber.

Jim Edgar remembered as the 'gold standard' of public service at Springfield funeral","text":"SPRINGFIELD — Hundreds celebrated the life and mourned the death of former Illinois Gov. Jim Edgar in services Saturday at Central Baptist Church. Political leaders, friends and relatives remembered the Republican as a “steadfast leader,” with a love for horses, reading and chocolate cake.\n\nEdgar, 79, died Sept. 14 due to complications from pancreatic cancer. He was diagnosed in January and was receiving treatment in Springfield.\n\nIn a pre-recorded video played during Saturday’s service, Edgar said he “had a good run.”\n\n“If I don’t get 10 more years like I’d hoped to get, at least I got probably 75 years of good time,” Edgar said in the video.\n\nHe was a two-term Republican governor, leading the state through much of the 1990s. He won re-election with the widest plurality any incumbent Illinois governor had ever received, securing all 102 counties except downstate Gallatin County.\n\nMany who worked in his cabinet remember Edgar, who was raised in Charleston, as someone who united Cook County and the collar counties with downstate Illinois. Despite his popularity and pressure from Republicans to run for the U.S. Senate, Edgar refused to run for a historic third term as governor.\n\nIn the 1960s, the Edgar family regularly attended Springfield’s Central Baptist Church, across the street from the governor’s mansion and about four blocks from the state Capitol. The church’s bells rang low and steady as the hearse carrying Edgar’s wooden casket pulled into the driveway. \n\nThe Rev. J.A. Stang said they were the same bells that rang during Abraham Lincoln’s funeral in 1865. \n\n“We are honored to ring that very same bell for another remarkable man,” Stang said.\n\nLike Lincoln, Edgar was known for his willingness to work across the aisle. Edgar, a moderate Republican, supported abortion access while also being a fiscal conservative. Last year, he endorsed Democrat Kamala Harris in her bid for president over Donald Trump.\n\nFelicia Norwood said Edgar never asked her what political party she belonged to. She was brought on as his senior policy adviser at the start of his first gubernatorial term in 1991. Norwood called him “demanding, but very fair.”\n\n“He asked me whether I had a passion for service,” Norwood said. “We worked together for long hours, tackling some of the state’s biggest challenges as a team. We challenged each other.”\n\nMany of his former staff members attended the service, and had also visited the state Capitol a day earlier to pay their respects to Edgar as he lay in state.\n\nJanet Mathis was Edgar’s press secretary. Mathis had traveled from Geneseo, a small town near the Quad Cities area about 150 miles from Springfield. She now runs the Edgar Fellows program at the University of Illinois — a program spearheaded by Edgar in 2012 to train up leaders in public policy. Mathis said the program has produced more than 500 fellows.\n\n“He always held a true north, and that’s something I appreciate about him,” Mathis said. He “led from the heart, solving problems for the people of Illinois.”\n\nTo Gov. JB Pritzker, Jim Edgar personified “good people.”\n\nThe Democrat was the first to eulogize him Saturday, calling Edgar “an icon of the great state of Illinois.” Pritzker and his wife, MK, were seated in the first pew, across the blue-carpeted aisle from Edgar’s immediate family.\n\n“When I was first elected governor, I looked around for experienced mentors that I could rely upon for advice and guidance,” Pritzker said. “ Fortunately for me, Illinois Gov. Jim Edgar’s values and judgment and service have been a model to follow.”\n\nPritzker remembers Edgar as being generous with his time, offering advice even as he struggled with health issues. As a fiscal conservative who inherited a $1 billion budget deficit upon becoming governor, Edgar told Pritzker that his most “important job is to pass a balanced budget.”\n\n“Every time we passed a balanced budget, like an excited kid to a parent, I’d say, ‘Look! I did what you said I should do. I passed a balanced budget,’” Pritzker said. “He’d say, ‘Good job. Now do it again.’”\n\nSeveral political luminaries attended the Saturday service, including former Gov. Pat Quinn, and Jayne Thompson, the widow of former Gov. Jim Thompson. Also attending were Rep. Nikki Budzinski, a Springfield Democrat, as well as Democratic and Republican leaders from the state Legislature.\n\nFormer Republican Rep. Ray LaHood called Edgar the “gold standard” for public service. Speaking at the pulpit, LaHood waved his arm over the crowd, saying Edgar’s lasting legacy would be the people he’s mentored, many of whom, he said, were sitting in the church’s pews.\n\n“We’ve all had mentors, every one of us,” LaHood said. “And more than 500 people in the Edgar Fellows Program benefited from the mentorship of Jim Edgar.”\n\nWhile he was a political mentor to many across the state, to Edgar’s grandchildren, he was “Papa,” or “Grandfather Sir.”\n\nJake Edgar Lowe remembers his grandfather having an endless collection of books, always taking a keen interest in what Jake and the other grandchildren were learning in school.\n\n“One of the greatest gifts our grandfather gave us was his love of learning,” Lowe said. “He set an extraordinary example of what it means to be a lifelong learner.”\n\nDakota Edgar said he will, however, remember his grandfather for his love for food. He said his “Papa Jim” was forever in pursuit of the perfect piece of chocolate cake and preferred his meals to be hot, not lukewarm.\n\n“His famous saying was, ‘You never know what your next meal will be, so you might as well enjoy the one in front of you,” Dakota Edgar said.\n\nMawa Iqbal covers state government and politics for WBEZ.

Experts say it's all part of a master plan","text":"A man had been murdered and protests were spreading across the United States.\n\nTraumatized Americans, sickened by violence, were searching their souls, asking what should be done. It was a fraught time, but the Duchess of Sussex knew she had to speak out.\n\n'I wanted to say the right thing and I was really nervous that I wouldn't, or that it would get picked apart,' she told students at her old Los Angeles high school in June 2020, after the killing of George Floyd.\n\n'I realize,' she said, 'the only wrong thing to say is to say nothing.'\n\nMeghan Markle seemed fearless back then.\n\nNow, with the country stunned once more by murder - this time of the conservative activist Charlie Kirk - and with President Donald Trump visiting her husband's homeland, Meghan's relative silence may speak volumes.\n\nNatalie Trice, who has spent 30 years advising clients about public relations and communications, senses a 'scaled-back approach' that 'feels like a deliberate shift, but maybe not one she has decided on.'\n\nAnd, Trice says, that's a bit of a shame.\n\n'Right now, look at what's happening to women's voices, and the voices of minorities,' she added. 'Meghan could use her voice not just for Hollywood visibility, but for impact, to amplify others, shape conversations and challenge the status quo.'\n\nIndeed, it's not that the 44-year-old has disappeared in the last 18 months - far from it.\n\nAsked in August whether there were any issues she was 'dying' to weigh in on but couldn't, Meghan told Bloomberg: 'No. I just make a choice of what matters to me, and what is important to me.'\n\nShe added: 'If there was anything I wanted to say or felt necessary to say then I'd say it.'\n\nMeghan relaunched her Instagram account in January and has been busily documenting date nights with her husband Prince Harry and idyllic scenes from their picture-perfect garden. Even their two children - six-year-old Archie and Lilibet, four - feature in the glossy montages: something that was once an anathema to the privacy-obsessed pair.\n\nWhen the Los Angeles wildfires broke out earlier this year, the couple visited an evacuation center and helped hand out emergency food parcels.\n\nShe tried again with a podcast.\n\nHer 12-part Archetypes series had been dropped by Spotify in June 2023 and Confessions of a Female Founder debuted in April with much fanfare, but as of today there have only been nine episodes, with the last released in June. And last month the second season of her critically panned Netflix lifestyle show, With Love, Meghan, made its debut.\n\nTrice said that Meghan's apparent pivot from meaty issues to soft-focus Instagram photos could be orchestrated by Netflix, which signed a deal to promote both her shows and her lifestyle brand, As Ever. \n\nBoth the Duchess and Netflix were approached by the Daily Mail for comment, but declined to do so. \n\nTrice said it was a delicate decision.\n\n'Meghan is walking a communications tightrope,' Trice said. 'Say too much, she's criticized. Say nothing, and she's accused of being performative. It's a classic case of \"damned if she does, damned if she doesn't\".'\n\nEden Gillott, a PR specializing in crisis communications, agrees.\n\n'She has a business brand to protect and a show built around friendship and joy that doesn't align with political hot takes,' he claimed. 'By holding back, she is repositioning her voice to be more intentional, closer to the Michelle Obama model, where people lean in when she does choose to speak.'\n\n'Holding back' is not a trait that many may associate with Meghan.\n\nShe often tells the story of her childhood activism, describing how at the age of 11 she wrote to a dishwasher liquid company and demanded they change their advertisements that appealed to only women to ones that targeted all consumers.\n\nIn May 2016, she said on a Comedy Central late-night show that Donald Trump was 'misogynistic' and 'divisive'. He, in return, called her 'nasty.' She prided herself on 'speaking her truth', claiming to the world that there was racism inside the British royal family and championing political causes such as paid family leave and voting rights.\n\nMeghan declared in Glamour magazine in 2017 that her heroines included Madeleine Albright, the first female secretary of state, and trailblazing environmentalist Jane Goodall. On moving to California in March 2020, she contacted Gloria Steinem to ask her to work on a voter-registration drive.\n\n'She reminds me that when you have anger, you have to channel that energy into something that makes a difference,' said Meghan at the time. 'That's what activism is. It's about how we show up.'\n\nOnly years later, in 2021, the Duchess told a summit why she was so passionate about paid parental leave, insisting: 'Even before I had any sort of privilege in my life - when my life and my lifestyle were very, very different - I always stood up for what was right.'\n\nFor a moment, Meghan even took up the mantle of gun-control activist.\n\nShe visited the Texas town of Uvalde in May 2022 following one of the worst school shootings in US history and sent a letter of support to members of the Moms Demand Action movement, founded after the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting. She returned with Harry in March 2024 to visit the family of teacher, Irma Garcia, who was among the 21 Uvalde victims.\n\nBut that crusading activity, too, seems to have faded: she had nothing to say about last month's Minneapolis church shooting, during which two young students were killed and nearly two dozen adults were injured.\n\nOnce, her name was even tossed around as a possible political candidate, with Meghan and Harry reportedly meeting Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, in October 2020 via Zoom to discuss her replacing then-Senator Kamala Harris.\n\nThe rumors surged once more in 2023 when Senator Dianne Feinstein died, with speculation that Meghan might seek the seat.\n\nNow she is adamant that the idea does not appeal.\n\n'No,' Meghan said in April, when asked if she would ever consider running for office. 'Never. Oh, God. I mean, you could say, \"Never say never.\" No, I'm not interested in that. No.'\n\nMark Borkowski, a crisis PR consultant, said: 'Meghan has learned, the hard way, that volume isn't the same as influence. The early phase of \"finding her voice\" became a cacophony - every speech, every podcast clip, every political nudge was amplified and often weaponized against her. The result? Fatigue. The media got bored of the sermon, the public got tired of the tone, and her commercial partners got nervous.'\n\nBorkowski said she was likely being warned to steer clear of controversy, in a bid to maintain a broad appeal.\n\n'Netflix and her other backers don't want noise - they want focus,' he said. 'A glossy docuseries or lifestyle brand can't thrive if the headlines are dominated by political spats or stray comments about the royals. Silence, in this case, is a strategy: it keeps the attention on the product, not the controversy.'\n\nWhich leaves her, well... chatting to her friends on her podcast and TV show, and making jam?","summary":"Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, was once weighing in on women's rights, gun control and politics.

This followed CBS canceling “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” shortly after the network paid a $16 million settlement to President Donald Trump over how “60 Minutes” edited an interview with Kamala Harris.\n\nVice President JD Vance and senior White House aide Stephen Miller have argued that a crackdown on left-of-center groups is necessary to stop people from telling the truth about what a bigot and conspiracy theorist Kirk was.\n\nAnd Fox News, the Republican Party’s de facto media arm, has joined the anti-First Amendment crusade as well.\n\n“For all the concern about the 'the First Amendment, the First Amendment,' what about all the amendments that Charlie Kirk lost? Because Charlie Kirk has no amendments right now. None,” said Fox pundit and former Trump press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, exhibiting her lack of knowledge of the U.S. Constitution that has served her so well for years.\n\nThe right’s attack on free speech isn’t something new that was prompted by Kirk’s death. For decades the conservative movement and the Republican Party have tried to suppress open expression.\n\nFor instance, in 1983 the Rev. Jerry Falwell of the pro-GOP Moral Majority sued Hustler Magazine after it mocked him in a parody ad. In 1988 the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the magazine and owner Larry Flynt, unanimously deciding that parody was protected speech under the First Amendment.\n\nIn another infamous moment following the Sept. 11 attacks, Bush White House press secretary Ari Fleischer went after comedian Bill Maher for criticizing the U.S. response to terrorism.\n\nFleischer told reporters that people “need to watch what they say, watch what they do,” adding, “this is not a time for remarks like that; there never is.”\n\nThe Patriot Act, which was passed by Congress and signed into law by President George W. Bush following the attacks, was used to suppress speech. Librarians were served gag orders and told by agents of the government not to speak, using claims of national security to justify censorship.\n\nMore recently, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis worked with the right-wing extremist group Moms for Liberty to push for bans on books in school libraries. The problem? The books in question contained positive portrayals of LGBTQ+ people.\n\nTrump has been the most visible figure on the right pushing for speech restrictions. When he first started campaigning for president in the 2016 election, Trump said he wanted to “open up” libel laws to go after journalists for accurately reporting on him. During both of his presidencies, but particularly in his current administration, Trump has repeatedly used the power of the presidency to attack dissent.\n\nTo give cover to their war on speech, conservatives have declared nearly everything they oppose politically as “woke,” and then pushed for the removal of “woke” things— including speech and diversity—from public and private institutions and individuals.\n\nConservatism has a serious problem when it comes to competing in an open war of ideas. Many conservative priorities, like racism and economic policies bent around the desires of the ultra-wealthy, are not popular with the public at large. To allow an open exchange of ideas is to allow for the chance that liberalism and the Democratic Party might succeed.\n\nRelated | The whitewashing of Charlie Kirk’s toxic legacy is underway\n\nInstead, conservatives have sought to rig the system. In an electoral sense, that has led to policies like gerrymandering congressional districts, redrawing borders to ensure Republicans win seats even in areas where Democrats would have a plurality or majority in a fair system.\n\nThe same practice is being borne out by the right’s crusade against the First Amendment. If ideas they don’t like are banned from public discourse, the right “wins” arguments by default.\n\nNot only does attacking speech change the rules to favor the right, but it undermines the foundation of the United States. The Revolutionary War and the subsequent drafting of the Constitution and the ratification of the Bill of Rights were meant to protect America. Battles like World War II were fought to defend the continued existence of those rights against the threat of fascism.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people died defending those rights.\n\nNow, using the murder of a bigot as an excuse, conservatives and the Republican Party are determined to erase one of the key pillars of American society.","summary":"Explaining the Right is a weekly series that looks at what the right wing is currently obsessing over, how it influences politics—and why you need to know.\n\n\n\n\nThe conservative movement has spent the days following the shocking murder of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk attacking a bedrock American value: free speech.\n\n\n\nIn the most high-profile incident, the Federal Communications Commission pressured ABC parent The Walt Disney Company to sideline talk show host Jimmy Kimmel after he made a joke mocking President Donald Trump’s response to Kirk’s death.

She writes that Buttigieg, quote, would have been an ideal partner if I were a straight white man. But we were already asking a lot of America to accept a woman, black woman, black woman married to a Jewish man. Part of me wanted to say, screw it. Let's just do it. But knowing what was at stake, it was too big of a risk. \n\nI want to go immediately to Pete Buttigieg's response, and then we can talk about it on the other side. \n\nPETE BUTTIGIEG: Well, I was surprised when I read that. I just believe in giving Americans more credit than that.

I kept the windows open as long as I could because I felt like that was such a touchstone of what was happening.”\n\nIn contrast, Kirk’s supporters are calling on everyone to express their anger peacefully at the ballot box by registering to vote and showing up for the 2026 midterms.\n\nThree, Kirk was not George Floyd. \n\nHe was a law-abiding, religiously devout, political organizer, happily married with two children.\n\nKirk was a media figure and head of a huge 501(c)(3) nonprofit whose brand was calmly debating students who disagreed with him.\n\nFloyd should not have died while in police custody. \n\nBut Floyd’s comorbidities were many. \n\nWhen arrested, he was under the influence of fentanyl and methamphetamine, with a heart condition and recent COVID infection.\n\nHe was a career felon with eight previous criminal convictions who had staged a violent home-invasion robbery and pointed a knife at the abdomen of one of the female occupants.\n\nWhen Kirk was killed, he was not on drugs. \n\nHe was not resisting police officers. \n\nAnd he was not trying to pass counterfeit currency.\n\nInstead, he eschewed violence and tried to engage in polite dialogue with students of different views.\n\nFour, Kirk was not, as alleged by the left, murdered by a right-wing shooter.\n\nHis death was not an example of right-on-right violence. Just the opposite was true.\n\nThe shooter, Tyler Robinson, was on record with his family expressing hatred for the conservative Kirk.\n\nRobinson engraved his bullets with both Antifa-like “anti-fascist” messaging and transgender references.\n\nHe lived with his transgender partner, who was a leftist.\n\nStay up to date on the shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk\n\nCharlie Kirk’s mentor reveals Turning Point USA founder’s final moments: ‘He was with Jesus’\n\nTrump says he told Charlie Kirk ‘you have a good chance at being president’\n\nJimmy Kimmel raged against Trump and his ‘MAGA mouth-breathers’ almost every night for a year before ABC pulled him off air\n\nCharlie Kirk had ‘break-up’ with Candace Owens after she went ‘too down the rabbit holes’\n\nArmed man posing as law enforcement arrested at Arizona stadium where Charlie Kirk’s funeral will be held\n\nRobinson’s aim was to end Kirk’s peaceful conservative career because he hated his politics and popularity and feared his influence.\n\nFive, the left used the death of Floyd to promote its hard-left and otherwise unpopular agenda — defunding the police, cashless bail, decriminalization of theft and DEI mandates.\n\nIt manipulated outrage, chaos and months-long violence to ram through radical cultural and top-down legal changes that otherwise had little popular support.\n\nConservatives upset over Kirk’s murder will bolster Turning Point USA. \n\nThey are determined through peaceful means to persuade more youth about the poverty and dangers of progressive thought.\n\nWhy is the left fabricating the circumstances surrounding and following Kirk’s murder?\n\nIn its signature projective style, the left is terrified that the right might follow its own example — by manipulating facts, ginning up street violence and issuing non-negotiable demands to achieve its agenda.\n\nBut the chief difference between the Kirk assassination and the death of Floyd is that the post-Floyd agenda had no majority support and so had to be rammed through in hysterical times by implied threats of unending violence beyond five months of continued mayhem.\n\nThe post-Kirk agenda eschewed violence because it was both morally wrong and politically counterproductive — since most Americans naturally favored most of what Kirk championed.\n\nVictor Davis Hanson is a distinguished fellow of the Center for American Greatness.","summary":"What a difference in how Americans reacted to Charlie Kirk vs. George Floyd&#39;s deaths","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/09/19/opinion/what-a-difference-in-how-americans-reacted-to-charlie-kirk-vs-george-floyds-deaths/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/newspress-collage-h524pnpam-1758314796995.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1758300444&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/Y3L9dLTt-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-20 19:05:25","author":"Victor Davis Hanson","authors":["Victor Davis Hanson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.465},{"id":362150976,"title":"Jimmy Kimmel's liberal bias laid bare as study reveals exact number of pro-Trump guests he hosted in the last four years","text":"Disgraced late-night host Jimmy Kimmel has only hosted one conservative guest in the last four years, according to new research.\n\nThe study noted that the only prominent conservative on Jimmy Kimmel Live! in recent years was MyPillow CEO and Trump ally Mike Lindell, according to research conducted by the conservative NewsBusters organization. \n\nThe research comes after Disney and ABC decided to indefinitely suspend the show after Kimmel's monologue about Charlie Kirk's assassination. \n\nNewsBusters is a project under the Media Research Center, which uses TV news archives and databases to collect data. \n\nA separate study from the organization claimed that 92 percent of the jokes Kimmel made on his show since January 2023 were at the expense of conservatives, and 97 percent of his political guests were left-leaning. \n\nNewsBusters also found that out of 7,797 political jokes that Kimmel made over 369 episodes, 7,189 were about right-leaning people or topics. \n\nThe study claimed that only 565 of his jokes targeted those on the left, which equates to about seven percent. \n\nNewsBusters cited Kimmel's top target as Donald Trump, with a whopping total of 3,584 jokes at the president's expense. \n\nHis second most-joked-about political figure was former president Joe Biden, with about 386 jokes targeted at him. \n\nExiled former Representative George Santos ranked third, followed by Elon Musk, Mike Lindell, Melania Trump, Donald Trump Jr., MAGA/Trump supporters, Eric Trump, and then Republicans as a political party. \n\nThe study noted that Lindell has appeared on Kimmel twice in recent years, once in 2021 and again in 2023. \n\nHowever, his appearance in 2023 was a comedic skit where he sat inside a claw machine as Kimmel trolled him, asking questions like: 'Why do you think people don't take you seriously?' \n\nNewsBusters mentioned a recent interview Kimmel conducted with comedian Bill Burr, but noted that his politics aren't consistently conservative or liberal. \n\nEven though the study claimed Kimmel had only one conservative on his show in four years, former Republican Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger appeared on the show in July when comedian Fortune Feimster guest-hosted. \n\nSchwarzenegger has latterly abandoned his GOP roots and revealed he was voting for Democrat Kamala Harris in last year's election. \n\nGeorge Conway, who was previously married to former Trump aide Kellyanne Conway, also appeared on the show last September. \n\nConway was a founding member of The Lincoln Project, a political action committee comprised of moderate and former Republicans heavily critical of Trump.\n\nKimmel has hosted several conservatives on his show throughout its entirety, including Trump, who came on the show in 2015. \n\nTrump told Kimmel during his interview that he was willing to debate Bernie Sanders and defended the temporary ban on Muslims he had proposed at the time. \n\nDuring his first presidential campaign, Trump also sat down for interviews with Stephen Colbert and Jimmy Fallon. \n\nOther conservatives to appear on Kimmel's show include: Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney in 2016, Senator Ted Cruz in 2016, and Senator Bill Cassidy in 2017. \n\nKimmel's show has become a flashpoint of partisanship following its abrupt suspension after Kirk slammed the 'MAGA gang' for using Kirk's assassination 'to score political points' by mischaracterizing his alleged killer, Tyler Robinson. \n\nHe then cut to a video of Donald Trump talking to reporters during his monologue, where the president answered a question about how he was handling Kirk's death. \n\nWhen asked how he was holding up, Trump responded: 'I think very good,' before directing the reporter's attention to construction on the White House ballroom. \n\n'He's at the fourth stage of grief: construction,' Kimmel joked. \n\nThe suspension has resulted in an outpouring of support from those who believe Kimmel's free speech was infringed upon following pressure from the Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr. \n\nHowever, those on the right have defended the federal government, claiming the move was due to Kimmel's unpopularity. \n\nDaily Mail has reached out to Kimmel's representatives and Disney for comment on the recent study.","summary":"A new study has slammed Jimmy Kimmel for a liberal bias, noting the lack of conservatives to appear on his show.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/media/article-15117605/jimmy-kimmel-left-wing-conservative-guest.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/09/20/18/102309149-0-image-m-40_1758388423407.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/09/20/8833640469793949003/1024x576_MP4_8833640469793949003.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-20 18:37:06","author":"Editor,Sophie Gable","authors":["Editor","Sophie Gable"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.269},{"id":362124920,"title":"The students who debated with Charlie Kirk: ‘His goal was to verbally defeat us’","text":"In the days after his killing, Charlie Kirk was remembered by his allies as a great debater. A quote taken from a widely shared video of Kirk discussing his life’s work – “when people stop talking, that’s when violence happens” – emblematized such eulogies.\n\nKirk toured American college campuses with his rightwing non-profit Turning Point USA, where he would set up a tent, table and microphone, and debate with undergrads. The goal, he said, was to “save western civilization”, and remembrances after his death positioned him as a budding statesman – a conservative hero who strode across the political divide for the sake of open dialogue.\n\nKirk applied basic rules of civility to his debate style, asking opponents their name and saying it was nice to meet them. He engaged young people in political discourse at a time when society has been split into bitterly antagonistic camps. But his critics are taking issue with any version of his legacy that does not account for the bigoted nature of his arguments. They are also closely examining his very style of deate.\n\n“I don’t think Charlie entered debates to come to a common consensus or to discover the truth,” said Mason, a 26-year-old graduate student who debated with Kirk on the YouTube show Surrounded last fall. “I think Charlie came to debates to verbally beat his opponents.”\n\nThis made him a formidable combatant. “He knew the arguments for nearly every conservative principle and even theological concept, and he spent years to develop that ability, so he was very great at pivoting and changing the conversation when it was not going his way,” said Mason, who is based in Los Angeles.\n\nDuring one debate, Kirk insisted on the truthfulness of a racist hoax about Haitian immigrants eating their neighbors’ pets. In another, he falsely called the term foetus “just a word for a human being”. He goaded college students, who eagerly stepped up to query or challenge him, with leading questions that were intended to elicit strong emotions – “what is a woman?” and “what is racism?” were two of his go-tos.\n\n“At its core, debate is supposed to be an academic exercise, with the goal being to be forthright and genuine in the information you present,” said Trent Webb, a professor of writing studies and rhetoric and director of the speech and debate team at Hofstra University. “In a good faith debate, the final goal is to reach consensus. If that doesn’t happen, then a lot of academics would consider it to be an exercise in futility.”\n\nAfter a Kirk debate, clips spun out on to social media, inviting millions into the fray. In celebration of perceived wins, Turning Point USA titled its YouTube videos things like: “Charlie Kirk ANNIHILATES Smart-Aleck Student Accusing Him of Propaganda”, “Charlie Kirk wrecks DEI talking points” and “Liberal Student Can’t Answer Charlie Kirk’s Simple Question.”\n\nDr Charles Woods, a professor of rhetoric and composition at East Texas A&M University, and the host of The Big Rhetorical Podcast, said Kirk distilled nuanced topics into stifling, good v bad arguments.\n\n“Charlie turned myriad opportunities for meaningful dialogic transactions rooted in civility and turned them into confrontational interactions by amplifying binaries in his argumentative structure,” Woods wrote in an email. “What we know is that there is a spectrum of ideologies and worldviews, not just two: Charlie’s and whoever is on the other side of the microphone.”\n\nHasan Piker, the popular leftist Twitch streamer who was scheduled to debate with Charlie Kirk later this month, wrote in a guest essay published in the New York Times that his would-be opponent was an “expert” at “[taking] advantage of people’s resentments and [redirecting] them toward vulnerable communities”.\n\nStill, leftists lined up to debate with him. Some, like a sociology professor who appeared genuinely curious to talk about the economic prospects of young people under Donald Trump, desired a meeting of the minds. For his part, Piker told Slate that while he is “not the biggest fan of the debate format”, he finds the forum “entertaining” and “galvanizing”.\n\nPerhaps no forum fit Kirk’s shtick better than the platform given to him by Jubilee Media, a YouTube channel that produces Surrounded, a thunderdome of debate where one person is encircled by a ring of ideological opponents who attempt to undercut his stances in lightning-fast rounds of verbal sparring, governed by literal red flags.\n\n“Can 25 Liberal College Students Outsmart 1 Conservative?” asked the series’ first episode, an hour and a half of nonstop ragebait released last September. In the show, Kirk debated with his opponents such statements as: “Abortion is murder and should be illegal” (wherein Kirk said yes, he would hypothetically make his 10-year-old daughter carry a child to term if she were to get pregnant from rape); “college is a scam”; and “Kamala Harris is a DEI candidate.” (Consider these Kirk’s greatest hits; he often debated these topics on campuses.)\n\nNaima Troutt, a 22-year-old film student at the University of Southern California, said the students made $25 for their appearance on the show, which has since raked in more than 35m views on YouTube and spawned countless viral clips.\n\nA campus organizer who was involved with Black Lives Matter and Palestinian solidarity protests, Troutt did not know who Kirk was when she showed up to set that day, which helped her see him as less of a rightwing celebrity and more as a man she disagreed with.\n\nTroutt described a “camaraderie” between the students, with some of the more “chronically online” trying to explain Kirk’s significance to her before they started filming. But Kirk was not as eager to chum it up. “He was either on his phone, or outright rude. You got the sense that you were an opponent to him even when you weren’t debating.”\n\nTroutt jumped into the hot seat twice to spar with Kirk over fetal viability, Harris’s qualifications for president and affirmative action. They agreed on practically nothing, but Troutt found some merit in debating Kirk. “I think I became much better at articulating my viewpoints and defending my viewpoints, because one thing about Charlie is that as much as I disagree with – and at times hate – everything that he believed and stated in the past, the fact is he’s one of the only rightwingers who regularly puts themselves out there,” Troutt said.\n\nTroutt is not alone in this opinion. California governor Gavin Newsom, who debated with Kirk on his podcast earlier this year (and admitted his son was a fan), wrote in a statement that he “admired [Kirk’s] passion and commitment to debate”. Representatives for New College of Florida, formerly a progressive school that fell under the control of rightwing allies of Governor Ron DeSantis, announced it will commission a statue of Kirk with his table and mic on campus. The school’s social media officer told Fox News that the statue will represent “what America is all about”.\n\nUltimately it was not rhetorical prowess but an insult that made Troutt a social media folk hero in #resistance circles: after Kirk attempted a gotcha moment by saying that “foetus” means “little human being” in Latin, Troutt called his self-satisfied smile “creepy”.\n\n“Smiling is creepy?” Kirk clapped back, to which Troutt responded: “No, your smile specifically.” The quip landed her an Interview magazine feature branding her “the college student who owned Charlie Kirk”. (Foetus in Latin actually means “a bringing forth; producing; fertile”.)\n\nIn March, Kirk asked her to come to the stage for a 10-minute debate he held at USC, where they tussled over DEI again.\n\n“I was shocked by that,” Troutt said. “I literally just roasted this man, and now he wants to debate with me again. But the second time he was a lot nicer. A lot of Trump and Kirk supporters came to watch it, and it was a more hostile environment, but he was less hostile to me.”\n\nMason, who debated with Kirk on Surrounded, describes himself as a progressive and felt it important to showcase leftist values.\n\n“They’re so often caricatured, especially for those in echo chambers of the right,” Mason said. (He asked that his last name not be shared for privacy reasons.) “As someone who feels very confident in my beliefs and convictions and my ability to communicate, I think it’s beneficial for me to go on a platform like this.”\n\nMason and Kirk’s topic was gender and transgender rights. Mason got Kirk to admit that he did not know the bimodal theory of gender, to which Kirk called him “condescending”; Mason apologized for his tone, but said he was “trying to match” Kirk’s energy toward other debaters. Despite the testiness, the pair had a lively debate.\n\n“Having a conversation with him was very easy to do,” Mason said. “I’ve consumed so much of his content that I knew what he was going to say. I wouldn’t say that it was easy for a lot of the other [Surrounded debaters], because he understands the sport of rhetoric and debate, and is really good at controlling the conversation. I had to put in a strong effort to assert myself.”\n\nWebb, the Hofstra professor, called the unmoderated format of Surrounded where claims are not factchecked, “unnerving”.\n\n“You can’t negate that it’s very interesting to watch,” Webb said, “but those students are not armed with proper data and evidence, and a lot of times they’re speaking to things that sometimes are blatantly untrue.”\n\nAfter the debate, Kirk hinted that he wanted Mason to come on his radio show. That never happened, but the two kept in touch. The second time they debated – about wealth inequality at the USC event – Kirk praised his “high IQ”. But Kirk never put the debate up online. “I like to believe that’s because the conversation didn’t go the way he planned,” Mason said, “but it could have also just been because I don’t have the same online presence as someone like Naima.”\n\nThe circus around Kirk’s social media did not just advance conservative causes. His work boosted young leftists like Troutt and to a lesser extent Mason. Gaining a platform as “the girl who owned Charlie Kirk” overwhelmed Troutt at first. “It did feel like getting thrown to the wolves,” she said. But she sustained her viral moment and has over half a million followers on TikTok, where she posts about politics.\n\nThis small online community of Kirk debaters consider themselves an influential voice of reason against “alt-right” internet stars like Kirk, Ben Shapiro and Candace Owens.\n\nHungry for another go, Troutt and other Surrounded debaters were scheduled to star in a reunion episode with Kirk later this month. On the morning of the day Kirk was killed, debaters in a Surrounded group chat were theorizing what topics might come up so they could start preparing. “It was surreal that in the middle of all of that, we got a news article sent by someone, saying: ‘Oh my God, this just happened,’” Mason said.\n\nAfter Kirk died, a range of reactions poured out on social media, with many recalling Kirk’s incendiary takes or honoring his memory. Kirk allies advocated for firing those who they said spoke against him. Meanwhile, some of the debaters were criticized by followers for their eulogies of their former opponent and the sadness they expressed about his killing.\n\nDean Withers, who appeared on the Surrounded episode and was called “the Democrats’ Bro Whisperer” by the the New York Times, mourned Kirk’s death through tears in a TikTok video. Tilly Middlehurst, a student who Kirk asked about feminism and what defines a woman at an event for Cambridge Union Society, her university’s debate club, choked up as she said the act of political violence left her “shaken and disgusted”.\n\nWithers later said that he became emotional watching the violent video of Kirk’s shooting online, because a close friend had been in the audience of the event and because he knew Kirk personally. “My tears weren’t me telling you how you should feel, but rather you happening to see me in how I felt,” he said. Middlehurst made her social media profiles private. (Neither responded to a request for comment. A representative for Cambridge Union Society wrote in an email: “Any comments made by speakers who openly debated with Mr. Kirk during our event earlier this year are expressed in a personal capacity and do not reflect the views of the Cambridge Union.”)\n\nTroutt felt “hesitant” to speak about Kirk’s death, though people looked to her for comment. “I don’t want to say the wrong thing and hurt people and lead to more violence. But I do want to help people in this moment process what this means for our country,” she said.\n\nAfter speaking with the Guardian, Troutt posted her own TikTok. “All acts of gun violence are horrible and must be condemned. That is my baseline,” she said in the clip. She added: “Mind your karma, watch what you put online.”\n\nMason believes that “two things” can be true at once: “The video [of the shooting] was incredibly grotesque, this is terrible across the board, and I do grieve for his young children, but that does not make the life or the principles that the victim stood for any more palatable.”\n\nHe found it hard to square the Kirk he interacted with, if briefly – a professional, nice enough man – with the hateful views he promoted.\n\n“I think that speaks to the dissociation that politics allows, where somebody can have these abstract concepts of what a group is, or speak ill of them, but it’s much more difficult to be insulting or vitriolic toward somebody who’s right in front of you,” Mason said.\n\nIn the aftermath of his death, Kirk’s legacy remains as divisive as one of his debates. But there is no denying his influence on public discourse.\n\n“When we teach argumentation and debate in our classrooms, it’s not necessarily agenda-driven,” said Webb, the rhetoric professor.\n\n“Social media has taught us to believe that all opinions said online are valid and require response, and because of that, people are nowadays easily baited into these ‘debates’.”","summary":"Young liberals challenged Kirk’s conservative views on the viral YouTube series Surrounded - an ‘unnerving’ spectacle, according to a rhetoric expert\n\nIn the days after his killing, Charlie Kirk was remembered by his allies as a great debater. A quote taken from a widely shared video of Kirk discussing his life’s work – “when people stop talking, that’s when violence happens” – emblematized such eulogies.\n\nKirk toured American college campuses with his rightwing non-profit Turning Point USA, where he would set up a tent, table and microphone, and debate with undergrads. The goal, he said, was to “save western civilization”, and remembrances after his death positioned him as a budding statesman – a conservative hero who strode across the political divide for the sake of open dialogue.\n\n Continue reading...","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/sep/20/charlie-kirk-debate-style","image":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71ca85b3c29512417bd36d12939f5117df2b3720/311_1054_2090_1671/master/2090.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-20 18:00:20","author":"Alaina Demopoulos","authors":["Alaina Demopoulos"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.294},{"id":362113764,"title":"Josh Shapiro says Kamala is 'going to have to answer' for why she never raised concerns over Biden's health","text":"Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro told ESPN host Stephen A. Smith that former Vice President Kamala Harris is \"going to have to answer\" for why she never raised any concerns to the public over former President Joe Biden's health in the lead-up to the 2024 election. Smith, on his \"Straight Shooter\" podcast on Thursday, asked Shapiro why Harris didn't share her concerns over Biden's health before revealing them in her new book \"107 Days.\" \"I haven't read the former vice president's book, and she's going to have to answer to how she was in the room and yet never said anything publicly,\" Shapiro told Smith. KAMALA HARRIS REVEALS WHAT BIDEN TOLD HER JUST BEFORE CRUCIAL DEBATE WITH TRUMP THAT LEFT HER 'ANGRY' Shapiro said he was \"extremely vocal\" about Biden’s fitness to run again and argued that Biden’s staff failed to fully brief him on his dwindling chances of victory. \"I can tell you that I tried to speak to them candidly about it and to do so in a constructive manner. I believe in talking directly to the individuals, not running around and talking to the media,\" Shapiro said. \"I don't mean that disrespectfully, but I think in that moment, you've got to be direct, and I was.\" Smith then asked Shapiro whether he plans on running for president in 2028, and if so, what he believed needs to be done to get the country back on the right track. KAMALA HARRIS HAD PROFANE MESSAGE FOR GOVERNORS UNEASY ABOUT SUPPORTING BIDEN Fox News Digital reached out to representatives of former Vice President Harris for comment. Before addressing whether he plans to run for president, Shapiro explained how humbled and honored he is to be the governor of Pennsylvania, and that he does not take his current job for granted. \"I also love this country, and I really believe, for the many of the reasons as you and I were talking about at the beginning of this conversation, we are at an inflection point, and I am troubled by what I'm seeing in this country, and I'm concerned about what I'm seeing in my party and I know that I have a voice that needs to be heard in that process,\" he detailed. \"How that voice ultimately gets heard, how it manifests itself, what I ultimately do, well we'll see. I don't think that's a decision that one can make sitting here right now.\" Shapiro emphasized his deep love for the country and his party, adding that he wants to help steer both in a more \"common sense direction.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE The book, \"2024: How Trump Retook the White House and the Democrats Lost America,\" by journalists Josh Dawsey of The Wall Street Journal, Tyler Pager of The New York Times, and Isaac Arnsdor of The Washington Post, described a vetting process that came down to three finalists: Walz, Shapiro, and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly. While most political experts felt Shapiro, governor of a key swing state, was the most logical choice, the book states that the interview with Harris and Shapiro \"revealed the two were not a perfect match.\" \"He came across as overly ambitious, pushing Harris to define what his role would be. He also conceded it would not be natural for him to serve as someone’s number two, leaving Harris with a bad impression,\" the book states.

Harris has weighed in on Disney’s decision to pull ABC’s \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" off the air \"indefinitely,\" defending Kimmel and slamming what she calls an \"outright abuse of power\" by the Trump administration. \"What we are witnessing is an outright abuse of power. This administration is attacking critics and using fear as a weapon to silence anyone who would speak out. Media corporations — from television networks to newspapers — are capitulating to these threats,\" Harris wrote on X about Kimmel’s suspension. \"We cannot dare to be silent or complacent in the face of this frontal assault on free speech. We, the people, deserve better.\" Many X users, including Musk, the platform’s owner, were quick to point out Harris’ own past statements, some suggested they appeared to support censorship. Musk resurfaced a 2019 tweet by Harris when Trump was serving his first time. Harris, a U.S. senator representing California at the time, was running for vice president when she made the post on X, now Twitter. \"Look let's be honest, @realDonaldTrump's Twitter account should be suspended,\" Harris wrote on Sept. 30, 2019. DISNEY’S JIMMY KIMMEL BENCHING PROMPTS CELEBRATION, BUT ALSO CAUTION, FROM CONSERVATIVES Musk re-posted the message on Friday, adding a thinking face emoji. Kimmel's show was pulled after he accused conservatives of reaching \"new lows\" in trying to pin a left-wing ideology on Tyler Robinson, who is accused of assassinating Charlie Kirk, even though prosecutors reaffirmed those ties in an indictment. \"We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it,\" Kimmel said, sparking outrage. There have been several questions about the role the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) played in the suspension. Those questioning the move are on both sides of the aisle, with Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, warning conservatives that they \"will regret\" setting the precedent. \"What he is saying is Jimmy Kimmel was lying. That's true, he was lying, and lying to the American people is not in the public interest,\" Cruz said on an episode of his podcast. \"He threatens explicitly — we're going to cancel ABC News' license. We're going to take him off the air, so ABC cannot broadcast anymore … He threatens it.\" CRUZ WARNS CONSERVATIVES 'WILL REGRET' FCC CENSORSHIP PUSH AGAINST ABC, OTHER MEDIA OUTLETS FCC Chairman Brendan Carr joined Fox News' Sean Hannity on Sept. 17, the day the suspension was announced, and defended the move. \"Broadcasters are different than any other form of communication,\" Carr said, pointing to affiliate groups like Nexstar and Sinclair that announced they would no longer carry \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" He argued that local stations acted appropriately, saying they were \"standing up to serve the interests of their community.\" \"Over the years, the FCC walked away from enforcing that public interest obligation,\" Carr said. \"I don’t think we’re better off as a country for it.\" FCC CHAIR BRENDAN CARR DEFENDS ABC AFFILIATES PULLING JIMMY KIMMEL SHOW AFTER MONOLOGUE ABOUT CHARLIE KIRK White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News on Saturday that the decision to \"fire Jimmy Kimmel and to cancel his show came from executives at ABC.\" \"That has now been reported,\" Leavitt said. \"And I can assure you it did not come from the White House and there was no pressure given from the president of the United States.\" The Biden-Harris administration has seen its share of censorship controversies, particularly in its interactions with social media companies during the COVID-19 pandemic. During a 2021 press conference, then-White House press secretary Jen Psaki said that the administration was \"flagging problematic posts for Facebook that spread disinformation.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In August 2024, just ahead of the presidential election, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg admitted in a letter that the Biden-Harris administration pressured Facebook to censor Americans. Zuckerberg made the admission in a letter to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, more than a year after providing the committee with thousands of documents as part of its investigation into content moderation on online platforms.

There were no mass riots after his death of the sort that followed Floyd’s demise.Floyd’s death was used by the Left to justify five months of rioting, arson, murder, looting, and attacking police officers.The postmortem respect for Kirk’s singular life was not characterized by $2 billion in property damage; the torching of a police precinct, a federal courthouse, and an iconic church; 35 deaths; and 1,500 injured law-enforcement officers.Instead, thousands of people peacefully joined his Turning Point USA organization and promised to redirect their lives toward peaceful political engagement.Two, after Kirk’s death, no prominent Republican or conservative is encouraging ongoing mass (and often violent) protests in the manner of high-profile leftists like former Vice President Kamala Harris.She blurted out on national television in June 2020, “But they’re not gonna stop. They’re not gonna stop, and this is a movement, I’m telling you. They’re not gonna stop, and everyone beware, because they’re not gonna stop. They’re not gonna stop before Election Day in November, and they’re not gonna stop after Election Day. Everyone should take note of that, on both levels, that they’re not going to let up—and they should not. And we should not.No conservatives—like the spouse of Gov. Tim Walz—declared of the 2020 arsons, “I could smell the burning tires, and that was a very real thing. I kept the windows open as long as I could because I felt like that was such a touchstone of what was happening.”Instead, Kirk’s supporters are calling on everyone to express their anger peacefully at the ballot box by registering to vote and showing up for the 2026 midterms.Three, Kirk was not Floyd. He was a law-abiding, religiously devout, political organizer, happily married with two children. Kirk was a media figure and head of a huge 501(c) (3) nonprofit whose brand was calmly debating students who disagreed with him.Floyd should not have died while in police custody. But Floyd’s comorbidities were many. When arrested, he was under the influence of fentanyl and methamphetamine, with a heart condition and recent COVID-19 infection.He was a career felon, with eight previous criminal convictions, who had in the past staged a violent home-invasion robbery and pointed a knife at the abdomen of one of the female occupants.In contrast, when Kirk was killed, he was not on drugs. He was not resisting police officers. And he was not trying to pass counterfeit currency. Instead, he eschewed violence and tried to engage in polite dialogue with students of different views.Four, Kirk was not, as alleged by the Left, murdered by a right-wing shooter. His death was not an example of right-on-right violence. Just the opposite was true. The shooter, Tyler Robinson, was on record with his family expressing hatred for the conservative Kirk.Robinson engraved his bullets with both Antifa-like “anti-fascist” messaging and transgender references. He lived with his transgender partner, who was a leftist. Robinson’s aim was to end Kirk’s peaceful conservative career because he hated his politics and popularity and feared his influence.Five, the Left used the death of Floyd to promote its hard-left and otherwise unpopular agenda—defunding the police, cashless bail, decriminalization of theft, and DEI mandates. It manipulated outrage, chaos, and monthslong violence to ram through radical cultural and top-down legal changes that otherwise had little popular support.Conservatives upset over Kirk’s murder will bolster Turning Point USA. They are determined through peaceful means to persuade more youth about the poverty and dangers of progressive thought.Why is the Left fabricating the circumstances surrounding and following Kirk’s murder?In its signature projective style, the Left is terrified that the right might follow its own example—by manipulating facts, ginning up street violence, and issuing non-negotiable demands to achieve its agenda.But the chief difference between the Kirk assassination and the death of Floyd is that the post-Floyd agenda had no majority support and so had to be rammed through in hysterical times by implied threats of unending violence beyond five months of continued mayhem.The post-Kirk agenda eschewed violence because it was both morally wrong and politically counterproductive—since most Americans naturally favored most of what Kirk championed.\n\n(C)2025 Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

As per the former VP’s upcoming memoir, 107 Days, it is now disclosed that things weren’t as simple as they might have looked between her and the former First Lady Jill Biden. \n\nTo be precise, fireworks weren’t the only thing sparking on July 4, 2024. That Independence Day, Harris, along with her husband, Doug Emhoff, accompanied the then-President Joe Biden and Jill Biden on the White House balcony to watch the sky light up. Usually, it should have been circled with cozy vibes, but instead, as per an information recalled by Harris, things were a bit icy. She told sources Jill turned to Emhoff and snapped. “She seemed tense, even angry. ‘What’s going on?’ she demanded. ‘Are you supporting us?’”\n\nIt seemed like Jill was a bit worried about Harris and her husband weren’t fully backing the re-election bid of Joe Biden, and despite Emhoff reassuring her, the damage was done. And as per reports, when the couple was alone, Emhoff vented, “They hide you away for four years, give you impossible, s– jobs … never fight back when you’re attacked, never praise your accomplishments. And still, they have to ask if we’re loyal?”\n\nSocial media piles on Jill\n\nAnd when netizens got to know about this, the supporters of Harris didn’t hold back either, with an X user writing, “So Jill really was a b— and a Karen to Kamala,” and this pointed at the frustration that multiple people felt over Jill Biden’s alleged treatment of the former VP.\n\nAnd Harris herself seemed to throw shade, too. On July 4, 2025, she posted a pic of herself and Emhoff watching fireworks the very night Jill went off on Doug. But in the photo, the Bidens were mysteriously cropped out. Her caption? “Things are hard right now. They are probably going to get worse before they get better.” Ouch. The snub quickly went viral. Political commentator Link Lauren called the move “symbolic.”\n\nJill snubs Kamala – on live TV\n\nThe chilly vibes didn’t end there. At Jimmy Carter’s funeral in January 2025, cameras caught Jill Biden snubbing Harris yet again. As the Bidens slid into the pew, Jill sat right next to Kamala but made zero effort to greet her. Instead, she subtly turned away — and yes, CNN’s Jake Tapper noticed. “You didn’t see a typically warm greeting between the First Couple and a Second Couple,” he remarked.\n\nHarris Memoir: “Reckless” to Let Biden Decide on 2024 Run\n• In her memoir “107 Days,” Kamala Harris calls it “recklessness” to let Biden and Jill decide alone on his 2024 run, arguing the stakes demanded broader input beyond “individual ego”\n• Harris claims Biden’s team… pic.twitter.com/HbJbztgEgl\n— Network Axis Group (@NetAxisGroup) September 11, 2025\n\n Between the balcony blow-up, the cropped photo, and that funeral frost, it’s safe to say Harris and Jill Biden’s feud has gone from whispers to full-blown Washington drama.

In the book \"107 Days,\" Harris wrote that she \"agrees\" with the concerns of parents and athletes who oppose letting males compete with females. \"I agree with the concerns expressed by parents and players that we have to take into account biological factors such as muscle mass and unfair student athletic advantage when we determine who plays on which teams, especially in contact sports,\" Harris wrote, per Politico. \"With goodwill and common sense, I believe we can come up with ways to do this, without vilifying and demonizing children.\" Harris never directly addressed the topic during her campaign, as it became one of the more influential factors in the election. Harris wrote she wouldn't turn against transgender people, and argued President Donald Trump \"was painting a bull’s-eye on their backs and putting them in peril.\" \"This is a community with which I have a deep connection,\" she wrote. \"There was no way I was going to go against my very nature and turn on transgender people.\" Trump's campaign ad with the slogan \"Kamala is for they/them, Donald Trump is for you,\" was hailed as the most effective message of the 2024 election. It highlighted the Democrats' position of enabling biological males in women's sports. Harris admitted in her book that her campaign should have \"given even more attention to how we might mitigate Trump’s attacks,\" regarding that message. The most notable instance of Harris addressing her record on transgender issues came during her interview with Bret Baier on Fox News in October. When Baier pressed Harris on her past support of tax-payer-funded gender transition surgeries for prisoners, Harris shied away from taking a stance and called it a \"remote issue.\" Still, the topic of trans athletes in women's sports may have haunted Harris on election day, according to data. A national exit poll conducted by the Concerned Women for America (CWA) legislative action committee found that 70% of moderate voters saw the issue of \"Donald Trump’s opposition to transgender boys and men playing girls' and women’s sports and of transgender boys and men using girls' and women’s bathrooms,\" as important to them. And 6% said it was the most important issue of all, while 44% said it was \"very important.\" Since the election, many key Democrats have distanced themselves from outwardly supporting trans athletes in women's sports. Meanwhile, a report by the New York Times suggests that former President Joe Biden himself did not agree with trans athletes participating in women's and girls' sports. \"According to a number of former Biden-administration officials, there remained a simmering debate inside the administration about whether those Title IX protections should extend to sports,\" the Times reported, saying that \"one side…maintained that there was no legal difference between letting trans students use bathrooms that align with their gender identity and letting trans student athletes play on sports teams that align with their gender identity.\" However, Biden was \"on the other side…who believed that the competitive, zero-sum nature of sports made them different from bathrooms — that some transgender athletes would enjoy unfair physical advantages over women. \"Most important, one of the officials holding this view was Biden himself,\" the Times wrote. The Times received a quote from a former Biden administration official who said Biden was \"particularly focused on the competition issue.\" This story first appeared on foxnews.com.","summary":"In her new book &quot;107 Days,&quot; Kamala Harris wrote that she &quot;agrees&quot; with the concerns of parents and athletes who oppose letting males compete with females.","url":"https://www.outkick.com/culture/kamala-harris-reveals-reservations-about-transgender-athletes-womens-sports-new-book","image":"https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2025/09/gettyimages-2207749841-scaled.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-20 15:18:07","author":"Jackson Thompson","authors":["Jackson Thompson"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.136},{"id":362304700,"title":"'Extremely harmful': Expert has new concern about Trump — and our 'psychological wellbeing'","text":"It was eight months ago, on January 20, 2025, that Donald Trump — following a narrow victory over Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in the United States' 2024 election — began his second presidency. Trump's diehard MAGA supporters are praising his first eight months back in office as \"promises made, promises kept,\" arguing that he is making good on his campaign promises and doing so at a rapid pace. But Trump's opponents view his second presidency as a full-fledged assault on everything from civil liberties to the economy to public health. \n\nCriticism of Trump's Health and Human Services Department (HHS) secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — the nephew of President John F. Kennedy — typically focuses on physical health.

And according to Chicago-based psychologist/author Michael Bader, the United States' \"psychological wellbeing\" is another casualty of the second Trump Administration.\n\nIn an article published by Salon on September 20 — exactly eight months after Trump was sworn into office — Bader argues that Trump is inflicting nonstop \"moral injury\" on the U.S.\n\n\"We are experiencing extreme moral injury, every single day,\" Bader explains. \"So what do I mean by moral injury? That can happen when a soldier is ordered to torture, abuse or kill an enemy combatant or, worse yet, to harm civilians. Or when a drone operator learns, after an attack, that his drone killed several children. Or when a nurse administers a painful treatment to a terminally ill patient, knowing it is not likely to change the patient's ultimate fate in any way. Or when, during the COVID pandemic, medical professionals were forced to make impossible choices due to resource shortages — to decide who got ventilators, to ration out protective equipment or to work in conditions they knew were unsafe for their patients or themselves.\"\n\nBader continues, \"Those situations, and others like them, are classic examples of moral injury. The individual afflicted feels guilt, shame and anger, but ultimately, and perhaps more important, feels — and is — objectively helpless to do anything about it…. I believe that under Donald Trump, millions upon millions of people are enduring daily moral injuries that are extremely harmful to psychological wellbeing.\"\n\nAccording to Bader, protecting one's mental health is an ongoing challenge during Trump's second presidency.\n\n\"Under Trump and his cabal,\" Bader argues, \"we are living in a nation in which tremendous harm is being perpetrated against innocent people and groups who cannot defend themselves. Every day, we see various forms of persecution, exploitation and oppression that violate our core values. The Trump Administration sends innocent people to what amounts to concentration camps for no good reason. The systems that support and guarantee our health are being defunded or otherwise undermined.\"\n\n Bader continues, \"We see institution after institution forced to bow to the corrupt authority of this administration in ways that are horrifying and degrading, and that violate basic human dignity and decency…. The only slim ray of hope offered to us is the possibility of a better electoral outcome in 2026 or 2028.\"\n\nMichael Bader's full article for Salon is available at this link.","summary":"It was eight months ago, on January 20, 2025, that Donald Trump — following a narrow victory over Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in the United States' 2024 election — began his second presidency.

The lawsuit alleges these were written with “actual malice, calculated to inflict maximum damage” on Trump, and published “maliciously” in full knowledge that the articles and the book were “filled with repugnant distortions and fabrications” about him.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social, Trump said it was a “Great Honor” to sue The New York Times for defamation and libel, calling the paper a “virtual ‘mouthpiece’ for the Radical Left Democrat Party.”\n\nMaybe the Times could sue Trump for saying that. But the discovery would kill them.\n\nThe discovery may kill the Pulitzer Prize Board, too, speaking figuratively, of course. The defendants in that lawsuit tried mightily to persuade a court to pause or toss Trump’s complaint, but that didn’t happen. Instead, Trump won some key legal victories and the case moved on to the discovery phase. Trump’s lawyers are set to depose one of the key “independent reviewers,” former Reuters Editor-in-Chief Stephen J. Adler, on Oct. 21.\n\nTrump says he was defamed by the Pulitzer Board’s statement in 2022 saying “two independent reviews” had found that “no passage or headlines, contentions or assertions in any of the winning submissions were discredited by facts that emerged subsequent to the conferral of the prizes.”\n\nGiven that the Mueller report and other government investigations found no collusion between Trump and Russia, the then-former president said the Pulitzer Board issued this statement “with knowledge or reckless disregard for its falsity.”\n\nHe has a point. And soon he may have another plaque for the donor wall at the presidential library.\n\nOne of the Pulitzer Board members, Poynter Institute for Media Studies president Neil Brown, told the court there’s a “real specter of this litigation being used to inflict irreparable harm on the Pulitzer Prizes and on the Defendants.”\n\nWhat actually inflicts irreparable harm is the refusal to acknowledge that mistakes were made. Renowned investigative journalist Jeff Gerth wrote a lengthy critique of the prize-winning reporting in 2023 for the prestigious Columbia Journalism Review. He pointed out that it was “Clinton and her campaign” that by 2016 “would secretly sponsor and publicly promote an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory that there was a secret alliance between Trump and Russia” and that “the media would eventually play a role in all that.”\n\nGerth wrote that Trump told him, during an interview at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, that in the early weeks of 2017 he was initially hoping to “get along” with the press, but the Russia stories kept coming. “I realized early on I had two jobs,” Trump said, “The first was to run the country, and the second was survival. I had to survive: the stories were unbelievably fake.”\n\nTrump has been fighting the media for survival ever since. Looking at where he is now, you’d have to say he’s winning. So it’s interesting to view his combativeness against the press not as an extension of a personality trait, but as a targeted political and media strategy for the survival of his brand as well as his political career.\n\nThe first lady is similarly combative. Melania Trump sued The Daily Mail over a 2016 article that alleged her modeling agency was an escort service. The case was settled with a reportedly multi-million-dollar payment to Mrs. Trump, a retraction and an apology.\n\nMore recently, attorneys for the first lady obtained retractions from HarperCollins UK, publisher of a book about Prince Andrew, and from a former top campaign adviser to Bill Clinton, James Carville, who repeated similar defamatory statements about an “Epstein connection” on his podcast. Carville released a statement saying, “We took down the video and edited out those comments from the episode. I also take back these statements and apologize.”\n\nIf Carville can do it, anybody can. The New York Times, the Washington Post and the Pulitzer Prize Board should admit they were wrong. If they continue to push false narratives, they may find themselves spending eternity on a donor plaque at the Trump presidential library.\n\nWrite Susan@SusanShelley.com and follow her on X @Susan_Shelley","summary":"Unbelievably fake","url":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/09/20/susan-shelley-trump-holds-the-media-to-account/","image":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Trump_73714-2.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-20 14:30:52","author":"Gqlshare,Susan Shelley","authors":["Gqlshare","Susan Shelley"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.16},{"id":362150974,"title":"Travis Barker's daughter Alabama, 19, reveals pregnancy loss in heartbreaking TikTok post… before quickly deleting it","text":"SHARE SELECTION\n\nReal Estate\n\nTaylor Swift\n\nJennifer Lopez\n\nBlake Lively\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nU.K. Showbiz\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSaturday, Sep 20th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJimmy Kimmel preparing sensational return to TV after being suspended indefinitely over Charlie Kirk comments\n\nFans devastated as beloved California theme park announces it is closing for the rest of the year\n\nEast Coasters ditch the Hamptons and turn charming summer escape into full time haven\n\nJimmy Kimmel was just the start.

In the book \"107 Days,\" Harris wrote that she \"agrees\" with the concerns of parents and athletes who oppose letting males compete with females. \"I agree with the concerns expressed by parents and players that we have to take into account biological factors such as muscle mass and unfair student athletic advantage when we determine who plays on which teams, especially in contact sports,\" Harris wrote, per Politico. \"With goodwill and common sense, I believe we can come up with ways to do this, without vilifying and demonizing children.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Harris never addressed the topic directly during her campaign, as the issue went on to be one of the more influential factors in the election. Harris wrote she wouldn't turn against transgender people, and argued President Donald Trump \"was painting a bull’s-eye on their backs and putting them in peril.\" \"This is a community with which I have a deep connection,\" she wrote. \"There was no way I was going to go against my very nature and turn on transgender people.\" Trump's campaign ad with the slogan \"Kamala is for they/them, Donald Trump is for you,\" was hailed as the most effective message of the 2024 election. It highlighted the Democrats' position of enabling biological males in women's sports. Harris admitted in her book that her campaign should have \"given even more attention to how we might mitigate Trump’s attacks,\" regarding that message. INSIDE GAVIN NEWSOM'S TRANSGENDER VOLLEYBALL CRISIS The most notable instance of Harris addressing her record on transgender issues came during her interview with Bret Baier on Fox News in October. When Baier pressed Harris on her past support of tax-payer-funded gender transition surgeries for prisoners, Harris shied away from taking a stance and called it a \"remote issue.\" Still, the topic of trans athletes in women's sports may have haunted Harris on election day, according to data. A national exit poll conducted by the Concerned Women for America (CWA) legislative action committee found that 70% of moderate voters saw the issue of \"Donald Trump’s opposition to transgender boys and men playing girls' and women’s sports and of transgender boys and men using girls' and women’s bathrooms,\" as important to them. And 6% said it was the most important issue of all, while 44% said it was \"very important.\" Since the election, many key Democrats have distanced themselves from outwardly supporting trans athletes in women's sports. Meanwhile, a report by the New York Times suggests that former President Joe Biden himself did not agree with trans athletes participating in women's and girls' sports. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"According to a number of former Biden-administration officials, there remained a simmering debate inside the administration about whether those Title IX protections should extend to sports,\" the Times reported, saying that \"one side…maintained that there was no legal difference between letting trans students use bathrooms that align with their gender identity and letting trans student athletes play on sports teams that align with their gender identity.\" However, Biden was \"on the other side…who believed that the competitive, zero-sum nature of sports made them different from bathrooms — that some transgender athletes would enjoy unfair physical advantages over women. \"Most important, one of the officials holding this view was Biden himself,\" the Times wrote. The Times received a quote from a former Biden administration official who said Biden was \"particularly focused on the competition issue.\" Follow Fox News Digital’s sports coverage on X, and subscribe to the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter.","summary":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris acknowledged transgender sports concerns while Democrats distance themselves from the issue after election defeat.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/sports/kamala-harris-reveals-reservations-about-transgender-athletes-womens-sports-book","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2021/11/Kamala-Harris.jpg","video":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6378459061112","publish_date":"2025-09-20 14:06:32","author":"Jackson Thompson","authors":["Jackson Thompson"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.121},{"id":362091856,"title":"Larry Wilson: Speak out against the rising tide of tyranny","text":"Just as you can’t reasonably discuss political violence in our nation without acknowledging that it is perpetrated by insane extremists of all stripes, so you can’t pretend that the other side is full of melty snowflakes who can’t take the heat when your side takes cancel culture to new levels without any sense at all of the double-standard irony.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, unlike any other president in modern memory, in the wake of the assassination of his ally Charlie Kirk refused to acknowledge that such violence is being perpetrated by malign forces on the right as well as on the left. But Trump as usual takes such a position to extremes. Asked at a press conference why he did not order flags lowered to honor Melissa Hortman, the Democratic speaker of the Minnesota House of Representatives who was assassinated alongside her husband this summer, as he did for Kirk, Trump initially said he was “not familiar” with the case. Uh huh.\n\nNow, more than ever, the Trump administration is on the warpath against (formerly) protected expressions of opinion. In what was already one of the most precarious moments for freedom in our society in our time, Trump is making matters radically, dangerously worse.\n\nHis vice president tells podcast listeners that if they hear opinions they don’t like from other Americans, they should contact employers in order to have people fired.\n\nWhen Trump hears TV host Jimmy Kimmel say something he doesn’t like, he doesn’t just use his bully pulpit to disagree. He says that his Attorney General Pam Bondi’s recent statement about her intent to prosecute what she sees as “hate speech” about the late Charlie Kirk could mean she will “go after” Kimmel’s employer ABC “because you treat me so unfairly. It’s hate.” Trump and his FCC chair, Brendan Carr, started talking about revoking ABC’s broadcast license, which is not really a thing that exists, except on the local-station level. No matter. It’s a threat to the network’s business by powerful people. This despite the fact, as free-speech group FIRE notes, “The FCC has no authority to control what a late night TV host can say, and the First Amendment protects Americans’ right to speculate on current events even if those speculations later turn out to be incorrect.” But, in order to protect corporate interests, ABC steps in and gets ahead of the game, cancelling Kimmel’s show on its own.\n\nIn the midst of a previous political correctness epidemic, it was the American right that created the term “cancel culture,” and insisted, quite correctly, that people can say what they will in our free society. Not anymore. It’s one more sign that this administration is not really of the right, though they play conservatives on TV. They’re something else entirely: merely authoritarian.\n\nAlthough, not if people of good will, ourselves, don’t allow it, and rebel, as good Americans always have, against the rising tide of conformity.\n\nTalking of TV hosts, I have to love what David Letterman said in response to Kimmel’s suspension: “You can’t go around firing somebody because you’re fearful or trying to suck up to an authoritarian — a criminal — administration in the Oval Office. That’s just not how this works.”\n\nAgain, it is if we let it happen without speaking out.\n\nTrump, who doesn’t believe in the First Amendment, sued “60 Minutes,” sued ABC News, sued his friend Rupert Murdoch’s Wall Street Journal. And now, in his most absurd effort yet at censoring the press, he’s suing The New York Times for a cool $15 billion for, among other things, endorsing Kamala Harris in an editorial he describes as “deranged” because the endorsement wasn’t for him, and for failing to write that Trump was already “a mega-celebrity and an enormous success in business” when he was hired for “The Apprentice” TV show.\n\nStop the assassinations. Snitch on people you know who are crazy and want to kill political figures, so their guns are taken away. And, just as importantly, stand up against these despots who want to take away the most American thing of all: your freedom of speech.\n\nLarry Wilson is on the Southern California News Group editorial board. lwilson@scng.com","summary":"Merely authoritarian.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/09/20/larry-wilson-speak-out-against-the-rising-tide-of-tyranny/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IDB-L-CONSTITUTION-0202-01.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-20 14:00:38","author":"Gqlshare,Larry Wilson","authors":["Gqlshare","Larry Wilson"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.292}]}
