The White House posted on social media, \"The Biden administration started the affordability crisis, but President Trump will end it so all Americans can achieve economic prosperity.\"Affordability is a major issue for Americans, with voters recently showing unhappiness with Trump’s economic policies by supporting Democrats whose campaigns focused on affordability, as per the report by Newsweek. To improve affordability, the Trump administration announced several measures, $2,000 rebates, possible 50-year mortgages, and removing tariffs on staples like beef, coffee, and tea.On Monday, Trump is expected to address the cost of living crisis and speak about tax cuts in his funding bill, including \"No Tax on Tips\". The McDonald’s Impact Summit will include franchise owners, operators, and suppliers. Trump said he almost \"knew I was going to win\" the 2024 election after his positive reception at a McDonald’s campaign stop.Trump’s McDonald’s momentAt the fast-food chain, Trump stood in as a fry cook and served customers at the window. He described the scene,\"Every one of them, the response was incredible. Almost like I knew I was going to win. When I saw that, I knew because the response was love. Some did a double take somewhat like that. Well, but it was, it was sort of an amazing moment\", as stated by Newsweek.During his speech, Trump made a side comment from X, Aaron Rupar, \"I said, 'why is the Gulf of Mexico called the Gulf of Mexico?' I said, 'We're changing the name.' And now it's the Gulf of America. Has nothing to do with McDonald's, but maybe it does\". Trump told the audience that \"prices are coming down\" in America and claimed the country is in the \"Golden Age of America\".Live EventsMcDonald’s 70 yearsTrump said he inherited a \"mess\" from former President Biden, claiming the U.S. had \"highest inflation in the history of our country\", though this is factually incorrect because inflation was higher in the 1920s, 1970s, and 1980s. He added, \"Now we have normal inflation. You are so damn lucky that I won that election\".Trump celebrated 70 years since Ray Kroc opened the first franchised McDonald’s in Des Plaines, Illinois, on April 15, 1955. The original restaurant was founded by Richard and Maurice McDonald in 1940 in California, and Kroc turned it into a global franchise, as per the report by Newsweek. Trump called it \"70 years of American greatness\" at the summit.Trump told the audience he is one of McDonald’s \"most loyal customers\". Trump joked about former presidential candidate Kamala Harris, claiming she never worked at McDonald’s, and recalled his own photo op where he stood in as a fry cook.FAQsQ1.

We had the highest inflation in the history of our country … and now we have normal inflation.”\n\nInflation ticked up to 3% in September over the past 12 months – the highest rate since the start of this year.\n\nThe Economist’s famed “Big Mac” index, which tracks the average price of the Golden Arches’ iconic burger, shows the sandwich cost $6.01 in July, up from $5.69 a year ago.\n\nThe surge in price comes as the cost of ground beef went up to an average of $6.32 in September — up from $5.67 a year before, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.\n\nLast week, the Trump administration eased tariffs on imports of beef, coffee, tropical fruits and other food products to help ease affordability concerns.\n\n“We have it down to a low level,” Trump said of inflation. “But we’re going to get it a little bit lower. We want perfection.”\n\nThe president, describing himself to the audience as “one of your all-time, most loyal customers,” said he’d heard from CEO Chris Kempczinski that “prices at McDonald’s are coming down,” as well.\n\nTrump touted his investment and trade deals, arguing that the economy would’ve been a “catastrophe” and the country may have gone “bankrupt” if he’d lost to former Vice President Kamala Harris last November.\n\n“You are so damn lucky that I won that election,” he said.\n\nTrump, who served french fries at a Pennsylvania McDonald’s during the 2024 election campaign, quipped that he’s “the very first former McDonald’s frycook to ever become president of the United States.”\n\n“It was not that easy!” he said of working the drive-thru.\n\nTrump argued that McDonald’s employees “know the people of our country better than anybody.”\n\n“Before the sun rises, you’re serving hot coffee to construction workers, nurses and police officers on the way to the job,” he said. “In the evening, you stand ready with the fast dinner and the smile for busy moms and their children as they race from school to soccer practice.\n\n“And late at night your lights are on, and the only one still glowing when the long haul trucker pulls up for a good meal and the best Coca-Cola in America.”\n\nTrump suggested that his go-to McDonald’s item is their Filet-O-Fish — heavy on one condiment.\n\n“I like the fish,” he said. “You could do a little bit more tartar sauce.”","summary":"“I will tell you that nobody has done what we've done in terms of pricing,” Trump argued.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/11/17/us-news/trump-promises-prices-are-coming-down-in-speech-to-mcdonalds-owners/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/newspress-collage-fvopa7q7w-1763424603909.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1763406661&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/x2SNNjG6-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-11-18 00:24:32","author":"Victor Nava","authors":["Victor Nava"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":0.123},{"id":379986920,"title":"WaPo Editorial Page Really Is Changing","text":"Jeff Bezos made some significant changes at The Washington Post, most notably to the Opinion Page. The first real signal of what was coming was his decision to quash the Post's endorsement of Kamala Harris in the election, which led to an inexorable exodus from the top echelons of the paper. \n\nHe instituted buyouts, and made clear that paper would no longer be laser-focused on being a shill for the Democrats and their further left-wing allies.

We are going to be writing every day in support and defense of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets. We’ll cover other topics too of course, but viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others. There was a time when a newspaper, especially one that was a local monopoly, might have seen it as a service to bring to the reader’s doorstep every morning a broad-based opinion section that sought to cover all views. Today, the internet does that job. I am of America and for America, and proud to be so. Our country did not get here by being typical. And a big part of America’s success has been freedom in the economic realm and everywhere else. Freedom is ethical — it minimizes coercion — and practical — it drives creativity, invention, and prosperity. I offered David Shipley, whom I greatly admire, the opportunity to lead this new chapter. I suggested to him that if the answer wasn’t “hell yes,” then it had to be “no.” After careful consideration, David decided to step away. This is a significant shift, it won’t be easy, and it will require 100% commitment — I respect his decision. We’ll be searching for a new Opinion Editor to own this new direction.I’m confident that free markets and personal liberties are right for America. I also believe these viewpoints are underserved in the current market of ideas and news opinion. I’m excited for us together to fill that void. Jeff\n\nThe answer appears to be that it was possible, and Bezos was serious about guiding the paper in a new direction. The extent to which this shift will be successful in the long term cannot, obviously, be known yet. The paper is in serious financial difficulties and is essentially a charity project of Bezos. Although there is no deep well of dedicated journalists who are not partisans, it's clear that so far, Bezos' efforts are yielding results. \n\nWaPo editorial: “Seattle’s coming socialist experiment” https://t.co/YuQYRpZP8l— Josh Kraushaar (@JoshKraushaar) November 17, 2025\n\nIt's not that the Post has become MAGA by any stretch of the imagination, although it certainly is no longer reflexively anti-Trump. Many people, including me to some extent, were surprised to see the Post Editorial defending the White House ballroom amid the Democratic freakout. \n\nWashington Post lead editorial in Sunday’s newspaper is a defense of the White House ballroom. https://t.co/1Xm0g85Dp4— James Hohmann (@jameshohmann) October 25, 2025\n\nIt's not exactly difficult to defend the construction of the ballroom, of course. No sane person honestly believes that state dinners should be held in a tent, or that foreign diplomats and leaders should be forced to use chemical toilets at such events. Even Obama officials privately admitted that the ballroom was a good idea. \n\nBut it was still notable that the Post actually SAID so, given that it undermined a Democratic Party talking point. Doing so was not unique in its history, but it was more than a little unusual, especially when it required agreeing with Bad Orange Man. \n\nZohran Mamdani’s success is a warning, the Editorial Board writes. https://t.co/mX4q5pjA4s— Washington Post Opinions (@PostOpinions) November 3, 2025\n\nOf course, breaking with the Democrats on the ballroom was hardly earth-shattering. The issue was always a tempest in a teapot, and Democrats were pouncing and seizing to distract from their shutdown failures. \n\nWhat's more significant is the fact that the Post is taking on the left, if not the Democrats per se. \n\nZohran Mamdani drops the mask, the Editorial Board writes.“Witness the mayor-elect’s change of character since his Tuesday election victory.” https://t.co/PMIPQqH696— Washington Post Opinions (@PostOpinions) November 8, 2025\n\nNow, one could argue that as the voice of the Democratic Party establishment, the Post's arguments benefit the establishmentarians who are engaged in a losing battle with the socialists, and that argument is correct on its own. The left has grown in power and is eating away at the cozy relationships and lifestyles of the liberal and powerful. \n\nCalifornia’s wealth-tax test https://t.co/xpPGOqPUMQ— James Hohmann (@jameshohmann) November 17, 2025\n\nSo the now consistent pattern of attacking the socialists is not bashing their allies—it really would be shocking to see that, if for no other reason than the fact that the Post needs to maintain its own cozy relationships with the establishment to keep cranking out stories daily. For all the talk of \"holding government accountable,\" the fact is that establishment news sources often depend on friendly relationships with those in power. \n\nAny story has to be Pulitzer-worthy to get reporters and Editorial Page-types to bite the hand that feeds them. \n\n\"Under Weingarten’s presidency, the American Federation of Teachers has reduced the intellectual level of its publications,\" Williamson M. Evers writes. https://t.co/j4DrOtXW4M— Washington Post Opinions (@PostOpinions) November 17, 2025\n\nStill, the drift to the center appears to be more than just catering to the establishment on the left and opening up ideological distance from the far left. There really does seem to be some new appreciation of the virtues of freedom and free markets. \n\nWhat does this mean in practical terms? Both less and more than we might think. Editorial pages have very little influence outside a very small circle. Ask any newspaper editor how influential their endorsements are, and you will get a chuckle. Few votes are moved, shall we say. \n\nOn the other hand, such pages do help set the Overton Window among the elite, and that matters more than you think. They help frame debates in many circles that matter. Voters may not care, but people who influence policy generally do. \n\nAnd, for those of us in the conservative intellectual circles, it means something else: we should actually pay attention to what they write. Not because we are more likely to agree with them before—they will likely still favor establishment views—but because we can't assume bad faith all the time on their part. They may actually have something to say about an issue that should be considered. \n\nStaying within our bubbles is dangerous for a lot of reasons, so it is important to find alternative voices to consider. Unfortunately, most things said in politics are said in bad faith. It is spin. So finding a source outside your bubble that isn't pure dreck is hard. \n\nCould the Washington Post Editorial Page become such a source? Perhaps. \n\nIf so, that is reason enough to be glad that they are shifting toward the center. If, every once in a while, you walk away thinking, \"Hmm, they may have a point,\" that would be a cause for celebration. It's what makes The Free Press so invaluable. \n\nAnything that makes us examine our assumptions is invaluable.

What to know about Trump admin, former presidents.","text":"Several political figures are set to attend the funeral of former Vice President Dick Cheney in the nation's capital this week.\n\nThe longtime force in Republican politics died of complications of pneumonia and cardiac and vascular disease at the age of 84 on Nov. 3, his family said. Born in Lincoln, Nebraska, in 1941, the former vice president grew up in Wyoming, where he served as a lawmaker and later retired.\n\nCheney served as vice president under George W. Bush from 2001 to 2009 and is considered one of the most powerful and controversial men to hold the role, in large part due to his role in leading the push to invade Iraq in 2003 and his views on presidential power.\n\nThe funeral will take place at the Washington National Cathedral at 11 a.m. ET on Thursday, Nov. 20. It's unclear where he will be buried. The service will be streamed on USA TODAY's YouTube channel.\n\nHere's what we know about who's going to Dick Cheney's funeral.\n\nWhy are flags at half-staff?

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nCheney became a critic of President Donald Trump after the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection, saying he voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election, USA TODAY previously reported.\n\nWhich former presidents will attend Dick Cheney's funeral\n\nFormer President George W. Bush is set to speak at the memorial. It's not clear if any other former presidents will attend.\n\nUSA TODAY reached out to former Presidents Bill Clinton, Barack Obama and Joe Biden on Nov. 17 and did not receive an immediate response.\n\nWho will speak at Dick Cheney's funeral?\n\nOther people confirmed to speak at Dick Cheney's funeral include:\n\nThe Rev.

If there is one surprising thing that both Melania and Michelle seem to agree on, it has to do with their disdain for Trump’s architectural tweaks at the White House, mainly the demolition of the East Wing.\n\nMelania’s alleged concerns about the East Wing demolition were first stated by an article in The Wall Street Journal. The news piece cited anonymous administration insiders who claimed that Melania had privately raised concerns about the demolition of the East Wing.\n\nThe report stated, “Everyone, it seems, has an opinion about the project, even first lady Melania Trump, who privately raised concerns about tearing down the East Wing and told associates it wasn’t her project, according to administration officials.”\n\nWhile Melania has largely been discreet about the East Wing demolition, in an interview with Laura Ingraham earlier this month, Donald Trump was asked if reports of Melania disapproving of the project were true. The President replied, “She loved her little tiny office.” Trump revealed that Melania eventually agreed with the idea. He said, “You know what? She is very smart. In about one day, she… if you would ask her now, she says it’s great.”\n\nIngraham asks Trump about destroying the East Wing to build his ballroom: “There was a report that Melania didn’t love this idea. Is that true?”\nTrump: “Well, she loved her little tiny office in there…If you were to ask her now, she says, ‘It’s great.'” pic.twitter.com/EK9BoXPc2i\n— The Bulwark (@BulwarkOnline) November 11, 2025\n\nTrump went on to defend his $300 million ballroom project in the same interview, adding, “I could have built the ballroom around it, but it would not have been–we are building one of the greatest balls in the world.”\n\nAs for Michelle Obama, she recently took a swipe at Trump’s Ballroom renovation at the White House, for which the East Wing was demolished. During her recent appearance on the Today show, hosted by Jenna Bush Hager, Michelle broke her silence on the East Wing demolition.\n\n“There’s pressure for every first lady, and I don’t think that other families dealt with that kind of criticism. But as you know, the first lady, it’s a strange job. Well, there’s no guidebook… There’s barely any staff. Now we don’t have a building,” Michelle Obama said during her appearance on the show.\n\nIn another interview, Michelle cryptically said, “Our view was this is not our house. We are here to do a job. We’re here for a turn. We’re here for a moment. We are caretakers of this history.”\n\nNEW: First Lady Michelle Obama slams Trump for bulldozing the East Wing: “Our view was this is not our house.

The statement carried no mention of the East Wing of the White House. The sole architectural change mentioned in the statement was about an “updated route” for the guests.\n\n“The White House will reopen its doors for public tours on Tuesday, December 2, 2025, with an updated route offering guests the opportunity to experience the history and beauty of the People’s House,” the statement from the Office of the First Lady read and as stated above, there was barely a mention of the East Wing.\n\nAmid the roaring controversy surrounding the White House Ballroom and the East Wing, critics and netizens alike have been busy speculating where Melania Trump’s office is currently stationed, especially given the fact that Melania has been largely absent during Donald Trump’s second Presidential term.","summary":"While Michelle has been vocal about the subject, Melania has been rather discreet","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/turns-out-melania-trump-and-michelle-obama-seem-to-agree-on-only-one-thing-and-it-is-this","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Melania-Trump_Michelle-Obama_1200.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-17 22:08:26","author":"Pranita Chaubey","authors":["Pranita Chaubey"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.08},{"id":379951528,"title":"Ezra Klein’s private briefing with Senate Dems raises internal concerns at New York Times: report","text":"Ezra Klein’s appearance at a private retreat for Senate Democrats earlier this year triggered internal concerns at the New York Times over whether the star columnist was edging too close to partisan politics, according to a report.\n\nSources familiar with the situation told Axios that concerns were raised within the newspaper — which has “typically has frowned on such actions by its journalists, even opinion columnists,” Axios reported — following his remarks at the one-day retreat in Mount Vernon, Va., in May.\n\nHe reportedly gave lawmakers a private briefing shortly after the release of his bestselling book “Abundance,” which “challenges liberals to create a more dynamic and prosperous society by cutting regulations and embracing new technologies,” as Axios put it.\n\nKlein’s invite to the retreat came as he’s gained influence among both lefty audiences and progressive officeholders — many of whom view the policy proposals in “Abundance” as a blueprint to recapture the White House and Congress.\n\nAsked for comment, Times spokesperson Danielle Rhoades said, “Ezra is a tremendous talent.”“He talks to people across the ideological spectrum; it’s essential for his reporting to have those conversations, and he approaches them as a journalist,” she added. “All of this makes him an ideal opinion columnist and host.”\n\nKlein’s podcast, which draws up to 500,000 monthly listeners, is consistently ranked among the most listened-to programs on digital platforms including Spotify and Apple Podcasts.\n\nHis columns are among the Gray Lady’s most-clicked pieces, according to internal data cited by Axios.\n\nKlein’s rising stardom has reportedly endeared himself to superiors including Sam Dolnick, the newspaper’s deputy managing editor and fifth-generation member of the Ochs-Sulzberger family that has controlled the Times for nearly 130 years.\n\nJill Abramson, the Times’s former executive editor, told Axios she didn’t see a conflict of interest in Klein’s talk at the Virginia retreat.\n\n“It’s true that this is a blurry line between journalism and politics and governing,” she told the news site.\n\n“But he’s in the opinion category and not covering news — that’s a little blurry itself.”\n\nKlein’s increasing influence among powerful Dems — including potential 2028 presidential candidates — has raised eyebrows in the party, according to Axios.\n\nHe has met privately with the likes of former Vice President Kamala Harris, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore and California Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\nKlein is also said to have held court with Josh Shapiro, the Pennsylvania governor who is reportedly interested in appearing on his podcast, according to Axios.\n\nSome Democrats are said to be concerned about Klein’s increasing influence in the party given the fact that it is looking to woo working class voters who have defected to the Republicans in recent elections.\n\n“You’re telling me this man who sits in a f–king West Elm-decorated office is going to be the thought leader for Democrats?” one Democratic aide to a potential presidential candidate told Axios.\n\nThe Post has sought comment from Harris, Moore, Newsom and Shapiro.","summary":"Klein, a Times columnist and host of \"The Ezra Klein Show\" podcast, took part in a retreat staged by Senate Democrats earlier this year.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/11/17/media/ezra-kleins-private-briefing-with-senate-democrats-raises-internal-concerns-at-new-york-times-report/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/115611416.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/6DCLOUsE-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-11-17 20:35:29","author":"Ariel Zilber","authors":["Ariel Zilber"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":0.24},{"id":379948488,"title":"Democrat Accuses Own Colleague Of ‘Election Subversion,’ Forces House Vote","text":"WASHINGTON – Rep.

They need people to believe that our society runs on a toxic mix of misogyny and testosterone. Every male elected to office is a slap in the face to the Left, unless that female is a Republican, in which case, being awful to a woman is suddenly in vogue. \n\nAccording to Fox News, Michelle Obama has watched as America has passed on two female candidates now, Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris, and has concluded that America just isn't ready for one: \n\n\"As we saw in this past election, sadly, we ain’t ready,\" she said on Friday.\"That’s why I’m like, don’t even look at me about running, because you all are lying. You’re not ready for a woman. You are not,\" she continued.The former first lady went on to say that she does not believe men in America are comfortable with a woman leading them.\"You know, we’ve got a lot of growing up to do, and there’s still, sadly, a lot of men who do not feel like they can be led by a woman, and we saw it,\" Obama said.\n\nTry to stop your eyeballs from rolling out of their sockets, if at all possible. \n\nObama's woe-is-women nonsense is just that: nonsense. Firstly, if she wants to blame men, I'll remind her that 46 percent of women turned out to vote for Trump over Harris. If even women didn't want her by a large margin, then this had to be a bit deeper than \"America sexist, America hate woman.\" Harris was just a bad candidate, a bad politician, and need I remind you, not chosen by Democrat voters to be their 2024 candidate.\n\nAnd as for Clinton, she was just as bad, but I don't think people truly understood that, thanks to all the media glossing she got. She was incredibly off-putting, physically frail, and had a record of failure that couldn't be spun. \n\nBut if Obama thinks men refuse to elect women, I'd point her to all the women who are currently holding office at every level of government as evidence that she's full of it. \n\nBut it does leave the question. Why hasn't America elected a woman as president in its history? \n\nRepublicans are fine with women as leaders, and if someone like an American version of Margaret Thatcher came along, I'm pretty sure you'd see half the country pull the lever for her. The thing is, most Republicans wouldn't care that she was a woman. They'd elect her because she's a good leader with a solid plan and the wherewithal to carry that plan out. Someone with the wisdom and wit to fight for the right thing. \n\nBut for Republicans, her womanhood would be a secondary, if not tertiary concern. This, I think, horrifies the Democrats who have convinced themselves that identity is the most important thing about anyone. When they choose a leader, they don't look first at merit, capability, plans, or intelligence; they look at the skin color, consider the plumbing, and go from there. \n\nAnd it's this issue that, I think, has kept women out of office. \n\nDemocrats will work tirelessly to make sure a woman from the Republican side doesn't get close to the highest seat in the land because they desperately want that honor first. Look at how they treat Republican women, especially if that woman is a little too close to the White House. Sarah Palin was the recipient of every sexist attack the Democrats profess to hate. \n\nBut the reason the Democrats have never gotten one elected despite all the king's horses and all the king's men is that they become so hyper-focused on the womahood aspect that they ignore everything about the candidate that makes her so unappealing. Democrat tastemakers have to effectively play defense the entire campaign, and even then, the best they can come up with to combat arguments against their would-be \"First Lady\" is that everyone attacking her is sexist. \n\nIt's not that America isn't ready for a woman leader; it's that we're not ready for that leader, and hopefully we never will be. \n\nA leader should be chosen to get the job done, not check an identity box. Until Democrats get that identity ultimately means little, a female president is a far-off prospect.","url":"https://redstate.com/brandon_morse/2025/11/17/michelle-obama-says-were-not-ready-for-a-woman-president-and-shes-both-right-and-very-wrong-n2196285","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2014/364/640ab6f3-d65c-4f15-9faf-12f7ba0bb75c.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-17 20:20:00","author":"Brandon Morse","authors":["Brandon Morse"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.391},{"id":379950802,"title":"NYC council member prepares Democratic primary challenge against Hakeem Jeffries","text":"Chi Ossé, a member of the New York City Council, has filed paperwork to launch a primary challenge against House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. The campaign filing, first reported by Axios and filed Monday with the Federal Election Commission, notes Ossé is running as a Democrat in New York's Brooklyn-based 8th District, which Jeffries has represented since 2013. Ossé did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but he said in a statement to Axios, “The Democratic Party’s leadership is not only failing to effectively fight back against Donald Trump, they have also failed to deliver a vision that we can all believe in.\" Ossé also publicly hinted at a run on Monday afternoon by writing in an X post, “Seems like we’re in a dire situation,” responding to another post noting Ossé had recently said he would not run for Congress and that it would take a \"dire situation\" for him to spend his twenties in the nation's capital. Jeffries, meanwhile, welcomed the challenge. “Leader Jeffries is fighting hard to lower the high cost of living, address the Republican healthcare crisis, combat corruption and win back control of the House for the good of the country,\" Jeffries spokesperson Justin Chermol said in a statement to NBC News. \"We welcome this primary challenge and look forward to a rigorous debate about the type of serious leadership required to deliver for the people of Brooklyn and the nation.” The top House Democrat has not faced a competitive primary fight in the recent past, and has run unopposed in primaries in five of his last seven elections, including last year, in the deep-blue district. Jeffries won a seventh term last year by 51 points, and former Vice President Kamala Harris won the district by 44 points, both winning more than 70% of the vote. Ossé was first elected to the New York City council in 2021 at just 23 years old, and he reportedly joined the Democratic Socialists of America earlier this year. Ossé is an ally of New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, although the New York Times reported that Mamdani discouraged Ossé from challenging Jeffries.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2026-election/nyc-council-member-prepares-democratic-primary-challenge-hakeem-jeffri-rcna244444","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-11/251117-Chi-Osse-gk-d3d4f6.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-17 19:48:27","author":"Bridget Bowman","authors":["Bridget Bowman"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.099},{"id":379936786,"title":"Swalwell supports FBI security for Patel’s girlfriend and asks for his own","text":"“I don’t want anything to happen to @FBIDirectorKash or his girlfriend.

Samir Shah told his employees in a memo seen by the PA news agency: \"We are determined to fight this.\" The US president has said he still intends to sue the corporation despite them issuing an apology over the act of deception last week. The BBC admitted their edit of Mr Trump’s speech - made just hours before the U.S. Capitol attack on January 6, 2021 - had given the \"mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action\". The broadcaster said the splicing of the speech was an \"error of judgment\", but refused to pay financial compensation. Lawyers representing Trump threatened to sue for one billion dollars in damages unless both a retraction and apology were published. In an email delivered to his staff this week, Mr Shah said: \"There is a lot being written, said and speculated upon about the possibility of legal action, including potential costs or settlements. \"In all this we are, of course, acutely aware of the privilege of our funding and the need to protect our licence fee payers, the British public.\" He continued: \"I want to be very clear with you – our position has not changed. There is no basis for a defamation case and we are determined to fight this. \"Last week I took the opportunity to speak with the Executive team and am reassured of their resolute focus on ensuring the BBC continues to deliver on behalf of audiences and staff. \"I know they plan to spend as much time as possible with their teams over the coming weeks to reinforce the importance of that work and answer your questions.\" In an interview with GB News broadcast on Saturday, Mr Trump said he had an \"obligation\" to sue the BBC, adding: \"This was so egregious. If you don’t do it, you don’t stop it from happening again with other people.\" Mr Trump also said the lawsuit would likely be filed \"someplace in the US\". The scandal prompted the resignations of two of the BBC’s most senior executives last week: director-general Tim Davie and news chief Deborah Turness. In response, the US President posted a statement on his social media platform, Truth Social, writing: \"The TOP people in the BBC, including TIM DAVIE, the BOSS, are all quitting/FIRED, because they were caught 'doctoring' my very good (PERFECT!) speech of January 6th. \"Thank you to The Telegraph for exposing these Corrupt 'Journalists'. These are very dishonest people who tried to step on the scales of a Presidential Election.\" He added: \"On top of everything else, they are from a Foreign Country, one that many consider our Number One Ally. What a terrible thing for Democracy!\" Mr Trump has a history of suing news organisations in the US. He previously settled a defamation lawsuit against ABC News after star anchor George Stephanopoulos falsely said he had been found \"liable for rape\".

The House will vote on the effort next week. \n\nWorse still, in a Republican party that virtually never openly criticizes Trump, Greene accused Trump of a “huge miscalculation” in his continued dismissal of the scandal and the Republicans pushing for more information.\n\n“Just being very honest with you, it’s something that I don’t understand,” the MAGA rep told CBS, arguing that releasing more Epstein information in the hands of federal law enforcement sends a powerful message that the government “will not protect the predators,” even if they are tied to rich and influential people. \n\nThe president, who denies being involved in any wrongdoing tied to Epstein, has called Republicans pursuing the Epstein scandal “stupid” and accused them of distracting from GOP achievements. \n\nBut the tension between Greene and Trump’s inner circle has been building for months. \n\nGreene, once better known for spouting conspiracy theories and demonizing her progressive colleagues when she entered Congress in 2021, has recently turned her considerable bully pulpit towards major parts of the Republican agenda.\n\nShe has hammered the GOP across the board, taking aim at its continued dithering on lowering health care costs.\n\nDuring the recent government shutdown, she broke from her party to join Democratic members in calling for action to keep expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies in place, though she was ultimately ignored.\n\nShe has also accused the president of abandoning Trump’s “America First” agenda by focusing too much on foreign intervention, emerging as an outspoken critic of the bipartisan support for the Israeli war effort in Gaza, and becoming one of the few American lawmakers from either party to agree with a consensus among human rights groups and a United Nations commission that have labelled the conflict a genocide.\n\nLast year, she mounted a failed attempt to oust her former ally Mike Johnson as Speaker of the House, and she has accused the top House Republican of fostering an environment that sidelines powerful women in the party, a charge she applied to the president on Saturday amid her ongoing feud.\n\n“Republicans don’t have support from women and this right here is a perfect example of why,” she wrote on X, linking back to a series of posts from Trump and allied GOP Rep. Troy Nehls dismissing the Epstein scandal as a Democratic “hoax.”\n\nThe weekend blow-up is a dramatic change from Greene’s rapid rise through MAGA world.\n\nGreene said she was inspired to seek office because of Trump, and the president praised her as a “future Republican star” and “real winner” after she won her first primary in 2020.\n\nOnce she took office, the two moved in lockstep. She wore a “Trump won” mask on the House floor at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic as she unleashed a months-long campaign against vaccination efforts and public health guidelines.\n\nTrump defended Greene after her colleagues moved to strip her from committee assignments over past inflammatory comments, while she backed the president as he and his allies in Congress sought to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election on baseless conspiracy theories that the results were rigged against him.\n\nGreene would go on to be the first of Georgia’s congressional delegation to endorse Trump for re-election in 2022, a time when the president’s political stocks were at a low ebb following a brutal round of impeachment trials and committee investigations that examined in detail how he nearly toppled a rightful election.\n\nGreene’s split with Trump is certainly notable, but those who go against the president have a way of burning brightly then fading to irrelevance within the party.\n\nFormer Republican congresswoman Liz Cheney, who supported the second Trump impeachment and helped lead the January 6 committee, lost her primary in 2022 then decided to back Democratic candidate Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. \n\nPence is now a marginal figure in the party, while Musk – despite a brief handshake with Trump in September at the funeral of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk – is no longer the omni-present fixture he was in Washington during the first months of the second Trump administration.\n\nGreene may have provoked Trump’s fury, but some in the Republican camp remain supportive of the Georgia rep.\n\n“I respect President Trump but I stand with my Congresswoman,” Emory Roy, Georgia-based activist for the conservative group Turning Point Action wrote on X, calling Greene “an America First fighter in D.C.”\n\nJim Tully, chairman of the local Republican party in the district Greene represents, wrote on X that the congresswoman enjoys the district’s “unwavering support.”\n\n“Her willingness to speak candidly on behalf of her constituents, even in the face of political pressure, underscores her courage and her fidelity to her oath,” he added.","summary":"After months of tension on everything from Epstein to inflation, Trump breaks up with his former die-hard ally","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-trump-epstein-files-b2866864.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/11/16/1/26/FILES-US-POLITICS-TRUMP-GREENE-ka2gl1m7.jpeg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/HVvn5FBf-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-11-17 17:07:32","author":"Josh Marcus","authors":["Josh Marcus"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.26},{"id":379918524,"title":"BBC ‘determined to fight’ Trump lawsuit over Panorama documentary  - Bahamas Spectator – Bahamas &amp;","text":"The BBC has announced it will mount a defence against a defamation lawsuit threatened by United States President Donald Trump, expected to be filed this week.\n\nOn Monday, Samir Shah, the chair of the BBC’s board, said the British broadcaster is prepared to fight any complaint the president files.\n\n“I want to be very clear with you — our position has not changed.

Currently, there are several Democrats in the race, including Maine Governor Janet Mills and military veteran and oyster farmer Graham Platner, who is ahead in polls.\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nMaine’s Senate race is seen as one of Democrats’ main opportunities to pick up a seat in 2026, as Collins is the only Republican representing a state won by Kamala Harris last November. \n\nHowever, the moderate Collins, who has held the seat since 1997, has a long history of holding on to her seat even as the state votes for the Democratic presidential candidate.\n\nWhat To Know\n\nThe Cygnal poll showed that 41 percent of respondents said they would vote for Collins, compared with 49 percent for a Democrat. However, she beats a generic Republican by two points.\n\nThe poll notes that Collins consistently overperforms the GOP baseline, particularly among swing voters, college-educated women and voters over 55.\n\nIt is not yet clear who the Democratic challenger to Collins will be, with several candidates declared.\n\nRecent polling shows progressive candidate Platner ahead among the declared Democratic candidates, with endorsements from several progressive organizations and lawmakers, including Senator Bernie Sanders and Rep. Ro Khanna.\n\nMaine Democratic senatorial candidate Graham Platner speaks at a town hall at the Leavitt Theater on October 22, 2025 in Ogunquit, Maine (L). Maine Senator Susan Collins speaks at the Dirksen Senate Office Building on July 09, 2025 in Washington, DC (R).\n\nAn October Pine Tree State Poll from the University of New Hampshire showed Platner ahead among the Democratic candidates, with 58 percent support compared to Governor Mills’ 24 percent. \n\nThe Cygnal poll will be a boost for Platner, as recent polling has shown conflicting results about a match-up with Collins.\n\nA poll from the Maine People’s Resource Center in October found that Platner was likely to secure the primary over Mills, and would beat Collins in the election 44.8 to 40.9 percent.\n\nHowever, another October poll conducted by Impact Research and commissioned by EMILY’s List—which has endorsed Mills—showed Platner trailing Collins after respondents were presented with information about his past social media posts. Initial exposure to the posts gave Collins a 51-42 percent lead. \n\nWhile the previously politically unknown Platner has energized the left, he has faced criticism after Reddit posts surfaced as well as a video showing him with a tattoo resembling Nazi imagery. Platner has apologized for the posts and denied knowing the symbol had Nazi associations.\n\nAccording to the Cygnal poll, one issue that could boost Collins is federal health care premium tax credits. \n\nThe survey found that if Collins votes to extend the enhanced Affordable Care Act premium tax credits, which are set to expire at the end of 2025, she would gain a six-point bump. This would put her at 43 percent support versus 45 percent for a Democrat.\n\nAnd 73 percent of Maine voters said they were concerned about the potential expiration of the credits, and 69 percent want Congress to act to extend them.\n\nThe Cygnal poll was conducted November 10—11 of 600 likely voters and has a margin of error of +/-4.\n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\nDemocratic candidate Graham Platner wrote on X on November 14: “We can defeat Susan Collins and send a message to everyone that a new dawn has come for American politics. One that is strong, one that is principled, one that is hopeful, and most importantly, one that fights and wins.”\n\nMark Brewer, a Professor of Political Science at the University of Maine in Orono, previously told Newsweek: “Collins is a multiterm incumbent and these revelations regarding Platner and the other optics around his campaign have been largely negative over the past few weeks.”\n\nWhat Happens Next\n\nThe Democratic primary will take place on June 9 next year, and the election will be on November 3.","summary":"A new poll shows Maine Senator Susan Collins trailing a Democratic challenger by eight points in the 2026 Senate election.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/graham-platners-chances-of-beating-susan-collins-get-huge-boost-11059953","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/1_5d3a15.png?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-17 16:55:34","author":"Alia Shoaib","authors":["Alia Shoaib"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.097},{"id":379892592,"title":"150 Years Of Data Destroy Democrat Dogma On Tariffs: Fed Study Finds They Lower, Not Raise, Inflation","text":"A new historical analysis is challenging the central premise that has guided trade policy, inflation forecasting, and Federal Reserve decision-making for decades. According to the study from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco spanning 150 years of tariff changes across three major Western economies, higher tariffs consistently lower inflation and raise unemployment - directly contradicting longstanding economic orthodoxy.\n\nThe authors, Régis Barnichon and Aayush Singh, examined tariff shifts between 1870 and 2020 in the United States, the United Kingdom, and France - and came to the conclusion that the conventional view of tariffs causing inflation does not survive empirical scrutiny.\n\n“We find that a tariff hike raises unemployment and lowers inflation,” they write. “This goes against the predictions of standard models, whereby CPI inflation should go up in response to higher tariffs.”\n\nThe distinction is subtle but crucial. The authors are not claiming that tariff hikes reduce the price level, only that they consistently reduce CPI inflation - the rate at which prices rise - in the short run, and that the effect is sizable. If the historical evidence is correct, policymakers may have been responding to a threat that did not exist.\n\nIf this sounds familiar, SOMEONE noted this in June of 2024...\n\nAgain, there is nothing controversial about this view: it is the definition of conventional wisdom. But what is conventional wisdom is once again dead wrong as it has been for much of the past 15 years?That is the hypothesis of none other than one of the most outspoken and contrarian Wall Street strategists, BofA's Michael Hartnett, who in his latest Flow Show writes that far from inflationary, any new trade war launched by Trump will be a substantially deflationary event. -Hartnett via ZH, June 2024\n\nA Political Divide Becomes an Economic Experiment\n\nThe study’s central methodological insight comes from American political history. For much of the period between Reconstruction and the Great Depression, Republicans and Democrats took sharply different positions on tariff policy. Republicans, aligned with industrial interests, favored higher tariffs; Democrats, representing agricultural regions, opposed them.\n\nBecause recessions did not systematically favor one party or the other, tariff changes often occurred for political - not economic - reasons. That allowed the authors to treat these shifts as a quasi-random policy experiment. When unemployment rose, Republicans often raised tariffs and Democrats often cut them, but not because of an underlying macroeconomic theory.\n\n“Since recessions did not favor one party over another, there was no general relation between the direction of tariff changes and the state of the economy,” the authors explain.\n\nThe researchers also examined eight major tariff reforms driven by long-term political considerations - including the McKinley Tariff of 1890 and the Trump tariffs of 2018 - and found similar effects.\n\nA Counterintuitive Relationship\n\nThe central finding is stark: a roughly four-percentage-point increase in average tariffs lowered inflation by about two percentage points and raised unemployment by roughly one percentage point. The relationship held across eras, from the pre-1913 globalization wave to the postwar period.\n\nOh wow, how unpossible https://t.co/1hD625mmNv pic.twitter.com/g5vNZWhqh2\n— zerohedge (@zerohedge) November 16, 2025\n\nThis pattern runs directly counter to standard economic theory, which holds that tariffs raise costs, push up consumer prices, and depress economic output. Instead, the historical record shows tariffs acting more like a negative demand shock - simultaneously tightening financial conditions and suppressing inflation.\n\n“These findings point towards tariff shocks acting through an aggregate demand channel,” the authors conclude.\n\nWhat exactly drives that channel remains unclear. The researchers note that tariff announcements often coincide with falling stock prices and spikes in market volatility, suggesting a possible link between uncertainty and weaker economic sentiment. Tariffs may also depress asset prices or alter wage bargaining dynamics. But the paper stops short of identifying the mechanism definitively.\n\nThe authors also found that: \n\nStock prices tend to fall after tariff hikes.Market volatility tends to rise.Tariff announcements may tighten financial conditions or depress household wealth.\n\nA Blow to the Economic Establishment\n\nThe implications are far-reaching. For decades, opponents of tariffs have argued that they operate as a regressive “tax on consumers.” During the 2024 presidential campaign, Kamala Harris frequently described Trump’s proposed tariffs as a national sales tax that would raise prices for American families.\n\nThe new evidence does not support that claim.\n\nInstead, the study suggests the core inflation argument against tariffs - long treated as dispositive in policy debates - was never empirically grounded. Barnichon and Singh note that surprisingly little macroeconomic research has been conducted on tariff effects, and that much of the conventional wisdom rested on theoretical assumptions rather than historical evidence.\n\nThe authors are careful not to endorse any political position, and do not evaluate Trump’s trade policy directly. But their findings significantly weaken the strongest criticisms leveled against Trump's tariff program: that it would intensify inflation.\n\nDid the Fed Misread Tariffs?\n\nThe findings also raise uncomfortable questions for the Federal Reserve.\n\nThroughout 2025, several Fed officials warned that tariff hikes risked fueling inflation, and the central bank slowed the pace of rate cuts in part because of those concerns.

David Kozak, a former professor of anthropology at Fort Lewis College, was caught on camera Nov. 7 yelling in reaction to the Associated Students of Fort Lewis College (ASFLC) voting to approve the TPUSA chapter in an emergency meeting. Their decision came after previously rejecting senior Jonah Flynn’s proposal to register the group with the university, which had sparked controversy across campus. The ASFLC's decision to reverse its earlier rejection to deny the chapter apparently angered Kozak, who flipped off the person filming and called the TPUSA supporters \"Nazis.\" He then said, \"F--- the Nazis.\" CONSERVATIVE STUDENT EXPOSES MIDWESTERN COLLEGE FOR PREVENTING TURNING POINT USA CHAPTER \"Go on, fascists,\" Kozak said. \"Go on, Nazi lovers.\" \"C’mon Nazis!,\" Kozak said repeatedly. Kozak's confrontation occurred after a challenging few weeks for the TPUSA chapter at the liberal arts college, which is based in a left-leaning area that overwhelmingly supported Democrat Kamala Harris in the last election. A Fort Lewis College spokesperson told Fox News Digital that Kozak had retired. \"Mr. Kozak retired from Fort Lewis College in 2022 and is no longer employed by the institution,\" the spokesperson told Fox News Digital. \"At Fort Lewis College, we remain committed to fostering an environment grounded in academic excellence, free expression, and civil discourse.\" COLORADO COLLEGE STUDENT GOVERNMENT REVERSES COURSE ON TPUSA CHAPTER AFTER EMERGENCY MEETING Flynn was at the center of controversy when he sought to start a TPUSA chapter, prompting a petition that accused TPUSA of causing harm to students. On Oct. 17, a petition launched by the Fort Lewis College community garnered over 400 signatures, arguing that TPUSA \"has engaged in actions that directly harm our community.\" \"At a college where many students identify as Indigenous, students of color, LGBTQ+, or from other underrepresented backgrounds, this harm cannot be ignored,\" the petition reads. \"We are calling on Fort Lewis College to take action that prioritizes student safety and well-being by refusing to recognize the TPUSA chapter as an RSO.\" COLORADO COLLEGE STUDENT VOWS TO FIGHT BACK AFTER STUDENT BOARD BLOCKS TPUSA CHAPTER Shortly after the chapter was denied, a counter-petition launched backing TPUSA, garnering over 1,000 signatures so far. The student government ultimately reversed itself, approving the chapter on Nov. 7. Kozak did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

'My nutshell [answer] is, generally they were very anti-normal guys, like...'\n\nDokoupil then interrupted: 'What do you mean normal guys?

I wasn’t here for colonialism or any of the stuff you guys are complaining about 200 years ago.\"'\n\nPortnoy took aim at the Democrats on frequent occasions before last year's election, which Trump prevailed in conclusively after winning all seven key battleground states.\n\nThe media magnate, who claims to have voted for the party in previous years, said he was left with 'no choice' but to vote for the Republican nominee because of the 'pure arrogance' of Kamala Harris' campaign.\n\nAt a different stage of the CBS interview, Portnoy also lifted the lid on the antisemitic abuse he has been dealing with 'daily', insisting he feels an obligation to speak out against it.\n\nJust last week the Barstool boss was subjected to abuse in the streets after a heckler shouted 'F*** the Jews' at him while he recorded one of his famous pizza reviews in Starkville, Mississippi.\n\nThe heckler, 20-year-old student Patrick McClintock, was arrested after a clip of the incident went viral on social media.\n\n'It’s every day now. Like, there’s a definitive shift in what’s going on. For me, being a Jewish person you got to step up,' Portnoy said about the rise of antisemitism.\n\n'You’re kind of someone people look up to in the Jewish community. You have to be like, alright, this is not normal.'\n\nThe Barstool founder, who was abused by an antisemitic heckler in Mississippi last week (pictured), also discussed the rise in hate he is being subjected to\n\nPatrick McClintock, 20, was arrested for yelling 'F*** the Jews' at Portnoy in the viral video\n\nThe incident in Mississippi was unfortunately not the first time in recent months Portnoy has been targeted with such disgraceful abuse over his faith. \n\nWhen the 48-year-old was filming a pizza review outside of Terrazza in Toronto in June, a passer-by yelled out 'f*** the Jews' from a car.\n\n'There we go,' Portnoy said, before being left furious that members of the crowd that had gathered around him on that day laughed at the incident.\n\n'What are you guys f***ing laughing about?' he shouted. They quickly fell silent, with Portnoy adding: 'Exactly.' \n\nA month before the Canada incident, he was embroiled in another Anti-Semitic scandal, after a bottle service worker was filmed holding a sign that read 'F*** the Jews' at the Barstool Sports bar in Philadelphia.\n\nPortnoy immediately fired two waitresses and identified the people allegedly responsible for ordering the sign - one being Temple University student Mo Khan.\n\nMississippiDemocrats\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nDave Portnoy reveals why he turned his back on the Democrats and opens up on sickening 'daily' antisemitic hate\n\nAdd comment","summary":"Portnoy opened up on his political stance during an interview with CBS Sunday Morning's Tony Dokoupil, while also discussing the abuse he is being subjected to on the streets.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/othersports/article-15297521/dave-portnoy-democrats-antisemitic-hate.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/11/17/15/103947943-0-image-m-36_1763394763075.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-17 16:21:29","author":"Editor,Oliver Salt","authors":["Editor","Oliver Salt"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.121},{"id":379893842,"title":"BBC ‘determined to fight’ Trump lawsuit over Panorama documentary  - Dominica Gazette – Dominica &amp;","text":"The BBC has announced it will mount a defence against a defamation lawsuit threatened by United States President Donald Trump, expected to be filed this week.\n\nOn Monday, Samir Shah, the chair of the BBC’s board, said the British broadcaster is prepared to fight any complaint the president files.\n\n“I want to be very clear with you — our position has not changed.

(RELATED: Leaked Dossier Accuses BBC Of Doctoring Trump’s Speech In Documentary: REPORT)\n\n“The evidence, Brian, is overwhelming that the BBC misled viewers. They falsely portrayed Trump, as you showed it, inciting violence in a clear case of what I think is defamation,” Jarrett said. “They deleted his caution to act peacefully and they spliced the video to give the opposite impression, almost certainly defamatory. Or else why would the BBC apologize retract and remove the story, but the problem for it doesn’t erase the damages that Trump sustained over three years.”\n\n“I mean, they ran this thing constantly over a long period of time and they did the same thing two years earlier, same phony clip, causing harm to Trump’s reputation not just in Great Britain but worldwide,” Jarrett continued. “Disparaging, dishonest propaganda, quite deliberate. Shameful journalism, Brian.”\n\nThe Telegraph obtained a 19-page dossier by Michael Prescott, a former external advisor to the BBC’s Editorial Guidelines and Standards Committee, which detailed how the network used spliced clips of Trumps speech that were 54 minutes apart to make it seem like he encouraged the riot at the Capitol building. Telegraph associate editor Gordon Rayner broke down how the video was edited to present the appearance that Trump endorsed the riot in a video posted by the newspaper on YouTube in which he held up a copy of the dossier, noting that the first part of the statement the BBC aired took place at 12:16 p.m. EST.\n\n“The BBC spliced together two clips that took place 54 minutes apart,” Rayner said in the video after replaying the BBC’s clip. Rayner then demonstrated that the second part of the clip the BBC aired was from remarks made at 1:10 p.m. EST.\n\n“We’ll sue them for between a billion and $5 billion probably some time next week,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One. “I think I have to do it. I mean, they have even admitted that they cheated.”\n\nThe BBC apologized to Trump Thursday in a letter from chairman Samir Shah after two top officials at the company resigned following the dossier’s release, saying the program would not air again.\n\n“Do you think he’s going to get significant damages?” Kilmeade asked Jarrett. “Do you think that money is shoot for the sky and get what you get?”\n\n“It’s hard to put a value on it at this early juncture, but it’s considerable. Two top executives resigned in disgrace when they removed the slander and yet the BBC still claims it wasn’t defamatory, which is absurd,” Jarrett said. “They knew it was wrong. Equally ludicrous is their insistence there is no institutional bias at the BBC. Really? Take a look at their own internal memo from their standards adviser exposing the newsroom for its pervasive, liberal bias corrupting the network’s reporting.” (RELATED: Coincidence? Major Outlet Reportedly Made 100 Mistakes Each Year About War In Gaza)\n\nTrump has won settlements from media outlets over their coverage of him. He secured a $15 million settlement with ABC in December 2024 after he sued the outlet on March 19, 2024, for defamation over “This Week” host George Stephanopoulos falsely saying Trump was found “liable for rape” during a contentious March 10, 2024, appearance by Republican Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina.\n\nParamount announced it settled a $10 billion lawsuit filed by Trump over the editing of an October 2024 interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris, who was Trump’s opponent in the 2024 presidential election, on “60 Minutes” on July 2.\n\nJarrett noted that he thought Trump would sue the BBC in the United States. “I don’t know if he is going to file in the United States or Great Britain,” Jarrett told Kilmeade. “Here in the U.S. it’s harder for a plaintiff. You have to prove actual malice knowingly false or in reckless disregard. In Great Britain, just the opposite, the burden of proof shifts to the defendant to disprove the defamatory video. My guess is he will sue here in the U.S. But I think his damages are considerable.”\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

The event, part of the rollout for her new book The Look, drew immediate international attention when clips of her comments circulated widely on social media.'As we saw in this past election, sadly, we ain't ready', Obama said. 'That's why I'm like, don't even look at me about running, because you all are lying. You're not ready for a woman. You are not. So don't waste my time'.The conversation, which was recorded and published to Obama's YouTube channel on 14 November, saw the former first lady elaborate further: 'We got a lot of growing up to do, and there's still, sadly, a lot of men who do not feel like they can be led by a woman, and we saw it'.A Pattern of Presidential LossesObama's assessment acknowledges a stark reality. Two of the Democratic Party's last three nominees — Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Kamala Harris in 2024 — were women, and both ultimately lost presidential elections to Trump.Clinton's 2016 defeat came despite winning the popular vote by nearly three million ballots. Harris's 2024 loss was more decisive, with Trump securing both the Electoral College and popular vote.Obama campaigned heavily for Harris in 2024, drawing large crowds to campaign events, advocating for women's health care and pleading with men to vote for Harris. At a Michigan rally days before the election, she asked the crowd: 'By every measure, [Harris] has demonstrated that she's ready. ... The real question is, as a country, are we ready for this moment?'The answer, Obama now argues, is clear.'Don't Waste My Time': Shutting Down 2028 SpeculationObama's comments come as social media campaigns urging her to run in 2028 have proliferated, with 'Michelle 2028' signs appearing at protests and online petitions gaining traction. An Ipsos poll published in March 2024 indicated that 50 per cent of registered voters would favour Obama as the Democratic candidate, compared to 40 per cent for both Joe Biden and Trump.Yet Obama has been consistent in her refusal to pursue elected office, a stance she first articulated publicly in 2016 whilst still serving as first lady. 'I will not run for president. No, nope, not going to do it', she said at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas.In a Netflix special, Obama acknowledged that 'Politics is hard', adding: 'It's got to be in your soul, because it is so important. It is not in my soul'.More recently, she has cited her daughters — Malia, 27, and Sasha, 24 — as a primary reason for staying out of politics. 'My daughters have already served their time', she said on the Not Gonna Lie podcast with Kylie Kelce, describing another White House term as 'unthinkable'.Obama has since returned to advocacy work, recently launching a coalition through the Obama Foundation's Girls Opportunity Alliance aimed at ensuring girls in economically disadvantaged areas overcome educational barriers.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/you-all-are-lying-michelle-obama-doubles-down-claim-us-men-refuse-led-woman-president-1755625","image":"https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1769312/former-first-lady-michelle-obama-has-denounced-apparent-double-standard-which-two-white-house.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=ec84a49b342a2191320f941823acf52d","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-17 15:42:29","author":"Justin Price","authors":["Justin Price"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.057},{"id":379896190,"title":"BBC ‘determined to fight’ Trump lawsuit over Panorama documentary","text":"The BBC has announced it will mount a defence against a defamation lawsuit threatened by United States President Donald Trump, expected to be filed this week.\n\nOn Monday, Samir Shah, the chair of the BBC’s board, said the British broadcaster is prepared to fight any complaint the president files.\n\n“I want to be very clear with you — our position has not changed. There is no basis for a defamation case, and we are determined to fight this,” Shah wrote in a letter to BBC staff.\n\nThe letter follows an announcement on Friday from President Trump, saying that he planned to proceed with a lawsuit in the coming days.\n\n“We’ll sue them for anywhere between a billion and $5bn, probably some time next week,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One. “I think I have to do it.”\n\nThe controversy stems from the editing of a documentary for the investigative television series Panorama, titled Trump: A Second Chance?\n\nThe documentary aired in October 2024, days before Trump won his second term as president that November.\n\nTrump and his allies have alleged that the Panorama documentary sought to misrepresent his statements on January 6, 2021, when a group of his supporters violently stormed the US Capitol in an attempt to disrupt the certification of the 2020 election.\n\nThe Republican leader had lost that election to his Democratic rival Joe Biden. But he has falsely maintained that his defeat was due to widespread voter fraud.\n\nThe Panorama documentary edited together two separate quotes from Trump’s speech on the day of the riot that were delivered nearly an hour apart.\n\nTogether, they appeared to show Trump encouraging his supporters to “fight like hell” after walking down to the Capitol.\n\nTrump and his supporters say that the edit was misleading and that it leaves out critical context. At one point in the speech, for example, Trump told his supporters “to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard”.\n\nTrump also followed his appeal to walk down to the Capitol by calling on his supporters to “cheer on our brave senators and Congressmen and women”.\n\nTumult at the BBC\n\nThe controversy over the documentary has roiled the BBC at a time when the broadcaster faces allegations of internal bias, leaked to the media.\n\nEarlier this month, The Daily Telegraph published an internal BBC memo in which a former adviser, Michael Prescott, expressed concern about “systemic problems” in the broadcaster’s coverage of hot-button topics, including transgender rights and Israel’s war on Gaza, which experts have identified as a genocide.\n\nThe BBC has repeatedly denied institutional bias, and its leadership has stood by the quality of its reporting.\n\nBut the scrutiny has led to a shake-up in the broadcaster’s leadership. On November 9, its director general Tim Davie and its news head Deborah Turness both resigned in separate letters to BBC staff.\n\n“Overall the BBC is delivering well, but there have been some mistakes made and as director general I have to take ultimate responsibility,” Davie wrote in his letter.\n\n“Our organisation is a critical ingredient of a healthy society, as well as a thriving creative sector. We should champion it, not weaponise it.”\n\nLast week, amid Trump’s threats of a lawsuit, the BBC issued a “personal letter” of apology to the US president.\n\nIt said Shah and the BBC were “sorry for the edit of the President’s speech”, according to a spokesperson’s statement. It also confirmed that the documentary would not be rebroadcast.\n\nBut Shah and the BBC nevertheless stood firm against the prospect of a lawsuit.\n\n“While the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim,” the statement said.\n\nA history of suing the news media\n\nTrump has a history of pursuing legal claims against news media he finds disfavourable, even when experts say his claims lack legal merit.\n\nLast year, for instance, Trump filed a defamation lawsuit against ABC News after an anchor in a live interview incorrectly said the US president had been “found liable for rape”.\n\nHe had been found liable for sexual abuse, not rape, in a civil case brought by writer E Jean Carroll.\n\nABC News agreed to pay $15m to settle the lawsuit in December 2024.\n\nTrump also sued CBS News for its editing of an interview with his 2024 election rival, Democrat Kamala Harris, on the TV programme 60 Minutes.\n\nIn July, CBS’s parent company Paramount agreed to a settlement of $16m, which came as the company sought the Trump administration’s approval to proceed with a merger.\n\nLast month, Trump also refiled a separate defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, one month after a federal judge threw it out.\n\nIn Monday’s letter, BBC chair Shah noted the cost such a lawsuit could exact on the BBC and its viewers, who pay a licensing fee to watch its products.\n\n“In all this we are, of course, acutely aware of the privilege of our funding and the need to protect our license fee payers, the British public,” Shah wrote.\n\nLegal experts believe Trump’s claims against the BBC face an uphill battle, particularly in the US, where the First Amendment of the Constitution includes strong safeguards for the news media.","summary":"In a letter, BBC Chair Samir Shah argued there remains &#039;no basis for a defamation case&#039; against the British broadcaster.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/17/bbc-determined-to-fight-trump-lawsuit-over-panorama-documentary?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AP25316389227050-1763388954.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-17 15:32:56","author":"Al Jazeera,Apps Support","authors":["Al Jazeera","Apps Support"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.291},{"id":379870730,"title":"Barron’s private comment to Joe Biden moments before Donald Trump’s fiery inauguration leaks","text":"Barron’s private comment to Joe Biden moments before Donald Trump’s fiery inauguration leaks\n\nA brief handshake between Barron Trump and Joe Biden sparked widespread speculation earlier this year.The moment went viral almost instantly, with people trying to decode what the president’s youngest son had said.Now, Eric Trump is setting the record straight about the quiet exchange that happened minutes before Donald Trump launched into his harsh inaugural address.A small but widely discussed moment from the 2025 presidential inauguration is back in the spotlight after Eric Trump revealed what his younger brother, Barron Trump, actually said to Joe Biden.

Curious about the rumors himself, Eric said he eventually called Barron directly. “So one night … I call Barron, I go, ‘Buddy, look, what did you actually say?’ And he goes, you know, like — it was something so polite I almost wouldn’t even get it right — but [something], like, ‘Congratulations and best of luck to you’ — or something like that,\" he shared. \"Something very respectful.”Eric went on to explain that Barron has never been one to escalate situations. “He doesn’t have that in him,” he said. Describing his brother’s personality, Eric added, “He’s a nice guy. He’s probably thinking it. He definitely has it up here [motioning to his head], but like, he’s too courteous to actually go out there and say it.

He pledged to end what he called censorship of free speech, direct the government to recognize only two genders, and ensure students “don’t feel ashamed” of their curriculum. He also emphasized an aggressive energy agenda, urging the country to “drill, baby, drill.”Trump closed his speech by promising a dramatic national shift, declaring, “Our golden age has just begun.”The family moment stood in contrast to the sharp political tone of the day.

After Oswalt praised Democratic New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on the podcast, Maher said she would need “some deprogramming” to become “a fantastic candidate.” (RELATED: ‘They’ve Reduced The Smear To Just People They Don’t Like’: Gutfeld Rips Democrats For Giving ‘Hitler A Makeover’)\n\n“What do you mean deprogramming?” Oswalt asked.\n\n“She’s never going to resonate with people outside of the bubble that she lives in, in the very, very far left,” Maher clarified. “And The New York Times of all people, the people I’ve been, like, squabbling with for the last seven, eight, ten years, whatever, when I was all about, ‘Democrats have gone too far left’ — they just put out a huge editorial basically saying exactly what I’ve been saying.”\n\nMaher appeared to be referencing an Oct. 20 New York Times editorial board piece arguing for both parties to moderate — a piece he also referenced on “Real Time with Bill Maher” on Nov. 14. The editorial asserts that there are no far-left candidates like Ocasio-Cortez who represent swing states or districts.\n\nOswalt asked if the piece argues that the New York Democrat is “too far left.”\n\n“Yes. And that the only way the Democrats will ever win again … is to be more moderate,” Maher said. “But we don’t have to argue about her.”\n\n“If people think she’s too far left, then that shows another way this country is broken right now,” Oswalt retorted.\n\nMaher pushed back, saying, “Well, I don’t think it’s necessarily broken in that way, but it just shows how the country is not there. That is not where the country is.”\n\nOswalt suggested that America is immature and “freaked out” after former President Barack Obama’s election.\n\n“We’re still living in that freakout. We are not as progressed and evolved and intelligent as we think we are because we keep freaking out about this stuff,” he said.\n\n“The left freak out, too. The left freaked out about a lot of bullshit too,” Maher replied.\n\nOswalt inquired about what Maher was referring to, prompting him to provide a comprehensive list.\n\n“Gender, race, parenthood, schools, homelessness, crime, the border, education,” he said. “We stopped being a scientific people.”\n\nOswalt disagreed, claiming “the left certainly stayed scientific.”\n\n“No, they didn’t! … they think gender bullishit that they went way too far with,” Maher said. “That’s not scientific.”\n\nPortraying former Vice President Kamala Harris and the Democratic Party as excessively far left on transgender issues was one of the most effective advertising campaigns in increasing support for President Donald Trump and GOP candidates during the 2024 election, according to multiple reports.\n\nMoreover, just two House Democrats voted in favor of the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act in January — which would prevent biological males from participating in female sports — as it passed 218-206. Senate Democrats blocked the act in March, with 45 voting to defeat a cloture vote on the bill.\n\nRoughly 80% of Americans feel that biological males shouldn’t be able to participate in women’s sports, according to a January New York Times/Ipsos poll.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Her silence over the past fortnight, as the Trump administration used tracks from her new album The Life of a Showgirl in a series of official posts, has become a talking point in both political and entertainment circles.Music from the album has already appeared in three posts linked directly to the administration. The first surfaced on the official White House TikTok account, which used her single The Fate of Ophelia over a patriotic slideshow. As Swift sings “pledge allegiance to your hands, your team, your vibes”, viewers were shown images of the American flag, President Trump, vice president JD Vance and the first and second ladies. Team Trump later posted two more clips. One featured Father Figure with the caption “this empire belongs to @President Donald J Trump”. The other, celebrating Melania Trump’s Patriot of the Year award, used Opalite as its soundtrack.Row over the administration’s use of popular music is not new. The White Stripes and the estate of Isaac Hayes have tried to sue in the past. Celine Dion, Beyoncé, Rihanna, Abba and Foo Fighters have all demanded that Trump stop playing their songs, according to the Guardian. Olivia Rodrigo slammed the administration, after the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) used her track All-American B***h in a video promoting deportation efforts. Instagram later removed the clip.Swift’s lack of response stands out because she is usually quick to challenge unauthorised use of her music. In the past, she has taken action against a theme park for using her music without a licence, pushed back against Etsy sellers making merchandise with her lyrics, pursued YouTubers over copyright breaches and even demanded retroactive songwriting credits from younger artists such as Olivia Rodrigo.Her quiet approach also feels at odds with the political stance she has taken in recent years. In her documentary Miss Americana, Swift spoke about her decision to address social issues and elections, saying she needed “to be on the right side of history”. She has backed Democratic candidates, supported Kamala Harris in 2024. Yet she has not commented on ICE raids, immigration debates or the Israel-Gaza war this year.Furthermore, Trump has recently praised her, saying, “I think that she’s a terrific person”.","summary":"","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/why-is-taylor-swift-silent-on-trump-administration-using-her-songs/articleshow/125387735.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-125387735/125387735.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-17 14:23:30","author":"Toi World Desk","authors":["Toi World Desk"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.358},{"id":379842070,"title":"Breaking Down the BBC’s Bias","text":"Progressives insist that you read, watch, and listen to what is obviously left-wing propaganda and “bear it” as unbiased commentary. So much so, in fact, that in my book, “The Ten Woke Commandments (You Must Not Obey),” the Seventh Commandment is “You Shall Bear False Witness (Trust the Media).”\n\nThere, I broke media bias down into nine categories and gave examples for each.\n\nWhile my book only references U.S. media like ABC, CBS, and NPR, it would have been easy to include the British Broadcasting Corporation, the United Kingdom’s state-owned media juggernaut. \n\nRecently, the Daily Telegraph, a conservative-leaning British newspaper, obtained a copy of an internal BBC report produced by Michael Prescott, a former external advisor to their Editorial Guidelines and Standards Committee. Informed by this report, President Donald Trump has called out the BBC for glaring bias in coverage of his first administration.\n\nAs British establishment wagons circle to defend the “Beeb” against this assault on its imagined integrity, let’s take a look at the broadcaster’s recent record. \n\nTrump’s specific complaint is that the BBC news program Panorama, which is a bit like CBS’s 60 Minutes, spliced together two clips of him speaking on Jan. 6, 2021, to make it look like he was encouraging people to commit violence and possibly insurrection. \n\nPreviously, Trump successfully sued CBS for editing then-candidate Kamala Harris’s answer to a question before the election. Harris’s original answer was lengthy and confusing, and 60 Minutes edited her response to make her appear (slightly) more cogent.\n\nThat’s unprofessional. But deliberately splicing two videos to make it appear Trump said something he didn’t is worse—and it appears to have been deliberate deceit by Panorama to vilify Trump. \n\nWhat other kinds of more subtle bias does one regularly find at the BBC? Here are a few. \n\nEditorial Bias\n\nAs part of the British government’s export of “soft power” to influence foreign audiences, the BBC operates services in foreign languages. The BBC Arabic service has a reputation for bias against Israel and for hiring or citing journalists who, at best, are sympathetic to the Palestinian cause at best and, at worst, are downright antisemitic.\n\nThe Prescott report claims that 215 of BBC Arabic’s stories about the October 7, 2023 attacks by Hamas on Israel and the ensuing war “were found to be biased, inaccurate or misleading,” and over 100 of them had to be corrected.\n\nIn one instance, a documentary about children in Gaza commissioned by the BBC was narrated by the son of a Hamas official and had to be pulled. In another instance, in October 2023, a BBC reporter immediately speculated that Israel was responsible for an explosion at the al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza, as Hamas had claimed. The AP news agency and others later concluded that the damage was caused by a “failed militant rocket.” \n\nAppeals to Experts\n\nOne way media outlets bring in bias is by selectively citing so-called experts from one side only. That’s a practice the BBC is no stranger to.\n\nFor example, the outlet was recently criticized for its sympathetic coverage of claims that the “milk” produced by males given drugs to induce secretions from the breast is comparable to mother’s milk. They interviewed a supposed expert from University College, London who “stated that there was persuasive evidence to support the nutritional value of trans women’s milk and dismissed any health concerns about the potential presence of male hormones in milk produced by trans women.”\n\nIn response to a complaint, the BBC agreed that “it should have been made clear to audiences that more research is needed before such conclusions can be drawn with confidence.” Indeed. \n\nOpinion Bias\n\nThe Prescott report concluded that pro-gender ideology BBC reporters did their best to kill stories and opinions from critics, thus “celebrating the trans experience without adequate balance or objectivity.” For example, the BBC uses people’s “preferred” pronouns in its coverage of contentious cases over allowing trans-identifying men into women’s spaces from changing rooms to prisons.\n\nHeadline Bias\n\nA random look at the BBC online headline page shows where the editors’ hearts are. On Nov. 12, for example, the top story was about an unproven allegation linking Trump to Jeffrey Epstein many years ago, while a more recent story about major corruption in Ukraine ranked below it.\n\nStories about Trump are generally negative. Stories about migration concentrate on the plight of illegal immigrants rather than on the hardship of the communities housing and paying for them. Stories about the Gaza war are generally more sympathetic to Palestinians than Israelis.\n\nSelective Coverage Bias\n\nMost news outlets send notifications to subscribers about breaking stories. According to the Prescott review, out of 219 “push” notifications of news stories sent to the BBC News app’s seven million users, only four were about the ongoing asylum claims crisis. Three of these alerts focused on how bad things were for migrants instead of the conditions for the communities forced to host them. Several major stories about asylum costs, including about the government renting hotels and even boats to house asylum seekers, were ignored.\n\nThe BBC review politely said, “It is not clear why none of these stories were sent out as push notifications, when perhaps less significant stories were extensively covered.” But it is clear. The BBC has an obvious bias in favor of asylum seekers and suppresses voices who are opposed to mass migration. \n\nThe BBC has fierce defenders, and as the world’s oldest broadcaster, it is a British tradition. But with the decline of television and radio and the rise of podcasts and alternative video platforms, the future of the UK’s state-run media—which requires everyone to pay around $200 in license fees a year—was already in question. Trump’s well-supported accusations of bias will not help the Beeb’s cause.","summary":"Progressives insist that you read, watch, and listen to what is obviously left-wing propaganda and “bear it” as unbiased commentary.

The BBC is independent of the UK Government - it's a matter for them and the US administration.'\n\nLiberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said: 'After a year of sucking up, the PM can't even get Donald Trump on the phone as he tries to destroy one of our most important institutions, the BBC. Was the state visit really worth this?'\n\nIt came as Mr Shah used an email to BBC staff to insist there was 'no basis' to Mr Trump's legal case and vowed to 'fight' the US President's action.\n\nMr Shah said in the email: 'There is a lot being written, said and speculated upon about the possibility of legal action, including potential costs or settlements.\n\n'In all this we are, of course, acutely aware of the privilege of our funding and the need to protect our licence fee payers, the British public.\n\n'I want to be very clear with you - our position has not changed. There is no basis for a defamation case and we are determined to fight this.'\n\nOn Friday, Mr Trump told reporters on board Air Force One he would sue the BBC for 'anywhere between $1billion and $5billion, probably sometime next week'.\n\nHis comments followed an apology from the BBC on Thursday in which it said the edit of Mr Trump's speech on January 6, 2021 had given the 'mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action'.\n\nThe broadcaster apologised and said the splicing of the speech was an 'error of judgment'.\n\nBut the BBC refused to pay financial compensation after the US President's lawyers threatened to sue for $1billion in damages unless a retraction and apology were published.\n\nOn Saturday, a BBC spokesperson said: 'We have had no further contact from President Trump's lawyers at this point. Our position remains the same.'\n\nIn an interview with GB News broadcast on Saturday, Mr Trump said he had an 'obligation' to sue the BBC, adding: 'This was so egregious. If you don't do it, you don't stop it from happening again with other people.'\n\nMr Trump also said the lawsuit would be likely to be filed 'someplace in the US'.\n\nOn Thursday, Mr Shah sent a personal letter to the White House to apologise for the editing, and lawyers for the corporation wrote to the President's legal team, a BBC spokesperson said.\n\nThe spokesperson added: 'While the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim.'\n\nMr Trump has a history of suing news organisations in the US, and settled a legal dispute with CBS News over an interview it broadcast on its 60 Minutes programme with former vice president Kamala Harris.\n\nThe Panorama scandal saw the resignations of two of the BBC's most senior executives: director-general Tim Davie and news chief Deborah Turness.\n\nThe programme, broadcast a week before the 2024 US election results, spliced two clips together so that Mr Trump appeared to tell the crowd: 'We're going to walk down to the Capitol… and I'll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.'\n\nThe BBC has said it will not air the Panorama episode Trump: A Second Chance? again, and published a retraction on the show's webpage on Thursday.\n\nBBC News reported on Saturday that the broadcaster had set out five main arguments in its letter to Mr Trump's legal team as to why it did not believe there was a basis for a defamation claim.\n\nIt said the BBC did not distribute the Panorama episode on its US channels and it was restricted on iPlayer to viewers in the UK; that the documentary did not cause Mr Trump harm as he was later re-elected; that the edit was not done with malice and was designed to shorten a long speech; that it was not meant to be considered in isolation but as part of an hour-long programme; and that an opinion on a matter of public concern and political speech is heavily protected under defamation laws in the US.\n\nAddressing staff earlier in the week, Mr Davie, who will remain in the position until a successor is appointed, said: 'We have to be very clear and stand up for our journalism.\n\n'We are a unique and precious organisation, and I see the free press under pressure, I see the weaponisation.\n\n'I think we've got to fight for our journalism. I'm really proud of our work, and the amazing work locally, globally, that we're doing is utterly precious.'\n\nThe process to appoint his successor is under way, the BBC said.\n\nAdditionally, Mr Shah has started a review into the EGSC (Editorial Guidelines and Standards Committee), with a 'focus on improving its processes and the way that it works', the corporation added.","summary":"No10 said the Prime Minister was yet to hold talks with Mr Trump more than a week on from his threat to leave TV licence fee-payers with a huge bill.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15298435/Keir-Starmer-spoken-Donald-Trump-threat-sue-BBC-1bn-corporations-chair-vows-fight-US-President.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/11/17/13/103943881-0-image-a-27_1763384842450.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/11/15/9171160942995918158/1024x576_MP4_9171160942995918158.mp4","publish_date":"2025-11-17 13:46:59","author":"Editor,Greg Heffer","authors":["Editor","Greg Heffer"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.39},{"id":379880632,"title":"Affordability tops concerns for Colorado Latinos, but criticism mounts for immigration crackdown","text":"Many members of Colorado’s Latino community fear they could be arrested by federal immigration authorities and have changed their daily lives to avoid it, a recent poll found — even as Latinos remain predominantly focused on economic concerns ahead of next year’s midterm elections.\n\n“In every aspect of life, Latinos have attenuated their normal behavior and avoided critical locations, like work and school, in order to stay clear of the immigration (enforcement) surge,” pollster Gary Segura told reporters upon releasing the results.\n\nThe issues identified more broadly in the Colorado Latino Agenda poll, which was released earlier this month, reflect a growing national consensus among all voters, not just Latinos. The overwhelming concern with affordability — respondents’ top four issues all related to the cost of living and the economy — shows that economic fears have endured through President Donald Trump’s first nine months in office, with recent elections across the country notching wins for Democrats who focused on the issue.\n\nBut the results also revealed mounting fear about an erosion of civil rights and discontent with the Republican president’s efforts to rapidly arrest and deport millions of immigrants without proper legal status.\n\nForty percent of the registered voters who participated in the survey said they or their communities feared that immigration authorities would arrest them, even if they’re U.S. citizens or have some kind of legal status. And 30% said they or their communities feared interacting with or calling the police, while 28% said they or their communities feared attending regular immigration proceedings because they could be arrested.\n\nAsked whether civil rights had improved under Trump, 62% said they hadn’t, compared to 20% who said they had.\n\nThose results also reflect that Latino voters are aware of how the federal government is carrying out its immigration agenda. Immigrants have repeatedly been arrested while attending regular immigration hearings, as advocates have said and court filings reviewed by The Denver Post have indicated.\n\nProPublica, a nonprofit news outlet, reported last month that more than 170 U.S. citizens have been detained by immigration authorities nationwide this year. Immigrants with legal status and work permits, like a Douglas County teacher arrested last month, have also been caught up in raids and arrests.\n\n“The actions of the Trump administration are fundamentally changing the way that Latino citizens are interacting with their government,” said Phil Chen, a political science professor at the University of Denver who reviewed the poll. “A quarter of them say that they or their community are missing classes because parents are worried about being arrested driving to school. I read (those results) as deeply, deeply troubling.”\n\nAbout 23% of Colorado residents are of Hispanic or Latino origin, according to the State Demography Office.\n\nThe poll was conducted by a bipartisan polling team last month. It surveyed 400 Latino registered voters in Colorado (meaning all respondents are U.S. citizens). Its margin of error was plus or minus 4.9 percentage points.\n\nConcerns with Trump, Republicans\n\nLatino Coloradans, who have tended to vote Democratic but not monolithically, also expressed mounting concerns with the Trump administration and Republicans who control Congress. Eighty-one percent of respondents said they were concerned that Congress wasn’t acting as a check on Trump. Asked who was to blame for the recent government shutdown, 61% said the president and his party, compared to 23% who blamed Democrats. Two-thirds disapproved of Trump’s performance in office. \n\nThere was also a “very concerning” bleed of support from formerly Trump-supporting Latino voters, Segura said. More than a third of respondents said they’d voted for Trump in 2024.\n\nThe vast majority of that group — 80% — said they would vote for him again. But 13% said they wouldn’t, and the remaining 7% said they were unsure. Of those who supported then-Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, 91% said they would vote for her again, and the remaining share said they weren’t sure.\n\n“When there’s a party that holds all of the levers of power in the federal government, (voters) are going to blame that party for things they think are not going well and probably give them credit for things that are going well,” Chen said. “This is the pattern we expect to find in every off-year and midterm election.\n\n“So if you were (U.S. Rep.) Gabe Evans or the state Republican Party, I think it’s really important to start thinking about how you talk about issues around affordability — around housing costs, food costs, inflation, job opportunities, things like that.”\n\nEvans, a Republican, represents the 8th Congressional District stretching from the northern Denver suburbs to Greeley, and it’s one of the most contested congressional seats in the country. Much of his successful 2024 campaign focused on immigration and public safety.\n\n‘Latinos are looking for leadership’\n\nStill, criticism of Trump doesn’t necessarily mean Latino voters are running straight into the arms of the Democratic Party, said Alex Sánchez, the president and CEO of Voces Unidas, which is part of the coalition that released the poll.\n\nFifty-two percent of self-identified independents surveyed in the poll said they either didn’t know which party they’d support next year or that they wanted to support someone else. (A plurality of independents, 35%, said they would support Democrats, compared to 12% for Republicans.)\n\n“There are warning signs to both parties in the data,” Sánchez said in an interview. “While, yes, Colorado Democrats fare better … they’re not too far from the danger zone. That’s what we see in the data: a clear sign that Latinos are looking for leadership, are looking for results.”\n\nHe added about Latinos: “We are not brand loyal. We don’t carry the party loyalty the same way that other voters do. Latinas and Latinos historically vote based on value and vote based on results, instead of party sticker and party label.”\n\nDespite the unpopularity of the Trump administration’s mass-deportation efforts, affordability concerns were still far and away the top concerns for voters. Forty-eight percent of respondents said the cost of living and inflation were their top priority.\n\nHousing affordability, jobs and the economy, and health care were the next-highest priorities, followed by gun violence and, in sixth, immigration. More than half of respondents said it was most important for election officials to tackle either prices and affordability, or wages and good jobs.\n\nThat’s unsurprising, Chen said. Affordability was a dominant issue in elections elsewhere in the U.S. earlier this month, he said, and has remained a top issue for all Colorado voters for years.\n\nWith next year’s midterms approaching, the New York Times reported that the Trump administration had begun floating new affordability ideas in recent weeks as it faces the reality that Americans are still pessimistic about the economy as they struggle with higher prices.\n\n“You can think of (the immigration crackdown) as a problem. It can affect your impressions of President Trump,” Chen said. “But when it comes to how (Latinos) are going to vote, (they’re) going to vote on the thing that’s really affected me, which is the economy.”\n\nStay up-to-date with Colorado Politics by signing up for our weekly newsletter, The Spot.","summary":"\"In every aspect of life, Latinos have attenuated their normal behavior and avoided critical locations, like work and school, in order to stay clear of the (enforcement) surge,\" a pollster says.","url":"https://www.denverpost.com/2025/11/17/colorado-latinos-poll-immigration-crackdown-trump-affordability/","image":"https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/TDP-L-immigrant-rights-RJS-13431.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-17 13:00:22","author":"Seth Klamann","authors":["Seth Klamann"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.303}]}
