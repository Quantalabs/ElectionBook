In May, while performing in Manchester, England, Springsteen branded the Trump administration “corrupt, incompetent and treasonous” and railed against DOGE cuts and ICE deportations.\n\nIn response, Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social: “I see that Highly Overrated Bruce Springsteen goes to a Foreign Country to speak badly about the President of the United States.\n\n“Never liked him, never liked his music, or his Radical Left Politics and, importantly, he’s not a talented guy — Just a pushy, obnoxious JERK, who fervently supported Crooked Joe Biden, a mentally incompetent FOOL, and our WORST EVER President, who came close to destroying our Country.”\n\nThe President went on to call Springsteen “dumb as a rock” and a “dried out prune of a rocker.” In a new interview with Time magazine, Springsteen was asked what he thought of Trump’s insults.\n\n“I absolutely couldn’t care less what he thinks about me,” said Springsteen. “He’s the living personification of what the 25th Amendment and impeachment were for. If Congress had any guts, he’d be consigned to the trash heap of history.”\n\nThe 25th Amendment of the Constitution covers, among other things, the process that allows for the removal of a president who is deemed unable to fulfill the duties of the office.\n\nSpringsteen also spoke about his concerns that many of the working-class Americans he sings about have become Trump supporters.\n\n“A lot of people bought into his lies,” said Springsteen. “He doesn’t care about the forgotten anybody but himself and the multibillionaires who stood behind him on Inauguration Day... You have to face the fact that a good number of Americans are simply comfortable with his politics of power and dominance.”\n\nThe “Born To Run” singer-songwriter had strong words for the Democratic party too, taking aim at their inability to provide an effective opposition to Trump.\n\n“We’re desperately in need of an effective alternative party, or for the Democratic Party to find someone who can speak to the majority of the nation,” said Springsteen. “There is a problem with the language that they’re using and the way they’re trying to reach people.”\n\nSpringsteen has consistently and vocally opposed Trump. Before last year’s election, he endorsed Trump’s opponent Kamala Harris.","summary":"The President described the rock legend as ‘highly overrated’ earlier this year","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/bruce-springsteen-donald-trump-trash-heap-b2833978.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2020/10/29/09/BeFunky-collage%20%2883%29.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/4rdgWwj6-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-25 22:43:02","author":"Kevin E G Perry","authors":["Kevin E G Perry"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.249},{"id":363510318,"title":"Video: Kamala Harris’ NYC Book Tour Disrupted by Anti-Israel Protesters","text":"I wonder who would actually spend money on Kamala Harris’ book, “107 Days.” Up to now, what we’ve heard about the book suggests it primarily involves placing blame on others for her lack of success.

We Watched Fox News to Find Out","text":"Those living inside a liberal bubble surely heard overwhelming praise for Jimmy Kimmel’s monologue Tuesday after his suspension. Yet the most flattering reviews might have inadvertently come from Fox News Channel, not in terms of what its hosts said, but rather what they didn’t.\n\nFox seemed to spend all day Wednesday trying to decide on a line of attack over Kimmel’s return to ABC. By the time the primetime hosts hit the stage that evening, they seemed to settle on three: That Kimmel never formally apologized; the left had turned him into a “First Amendment martyr,” as Fox’s Will Cain put it; and never mind him, Democrats were hypocrites for Biden administration policies and all the people they allowed to be canceled without offering a “free speech” defense at the time.\n\n“He wasn’t sorry, so he didn’t say ‘I’m sorry,’” Fox’s Laura Ingraham offered with customary disdain, addressing Kimmel to add, “The government did not get you suspended.”\n\nPerhaps the biggest proof that Kimmel offered a compelling argument is Fox News didn’t spend that much time discussing it — certainly, not compared to CNN and MSNBC. Barely any of the clips on Fox News’ YouTube channel from after Kimmel’s return are about the late night host, with the network opting instead to focus on Kamala Harris’ book tour. Indeed, there was an almost obligatory quality to the coverage, which mostly reinforced Kimmel’s argument that if you didn’t like him before the controversy, very little he could say that would change your mind.\n\nOnly a few Fox hosts or pundits, like Jesse Watters, sought to echo Trump’s fairness complaint, and the question of the late-night shows heavily tilting against Republicans in their guest lineups and the targets they choose to lampoon.\n\nOthers, like Sean Hannity, swung back to the contention this was really just a business decision by ABC, unrelated to pressure from FCC Chairman Brendan Carr. Hannity’s eager-to-please Fox News contributor, Joe Concha, went with the “Democrats as hypocrites” line, given that Disney had previously fired Roseanne Barr and “The Mandalorian” co-star Gina Carano in 2018 and 2021, respectively, for what were seen as offensive comments — the distinction being, just to close the loop, that the FCC played no role in those events.\n\nAll told, Kimmel received relatively little coverage on Fox, which has a habit, when a story isn’t particularly hospitable to President Trump, of simply changing the subject and zooming in on other matters.\n\nGranted, part of that has to do with the vagaries of the turbo-charged Trump news cycle, and a story that felt more conducive to Fox’s habit of seizing on events to express outrage — in this case, a fatal shooting at an ICE facility in Dallas, which Republican politicians and Fox hosts directly linked to Democratic rhetoric.\n\nThen again, the sad truth about the U.S. right now is coverage of a horrific act of gun violence is often pushed off home pages by some new violent event. (On the left, there was a different distraction: The renewed threat of Trump using the Justice Department to target his political enemies, with reports of a possible indictment of former FBI director James Comey).\n\nKimmel’s non-apology is something Watters acknowledged as recognizing from experience — a notable aside, given that some have seized on a joke the Fox News host made this week about bombing the United Nations building as the kind of comment that would merit a response from the network. While Watters hasn’t addressed that, “Fox & Friends” host Brian Kilmeade was forced to apologize after saying that homeless people should be given lethal injections.\n\nThe apology, or lack thereof, was also brought up on “Gutfeld!,” Fox’s late-night alternative, although host Greg Gutfeld’s vaguely coherent riff mostly kept coming back to mocking Kimmel for fighting back tears when he discussed Kirk’s death.\n\nAs for Kimmel, the second night of his show reflected a return to business as usual, which included skewering Trump for his low poll numbers, noting that Trump continued to threaten ABC and comparing the president to “An old-fashioned ‘80s movie-style bully.”\n\nIn a way, though, the most significant comments Wednesday might have come from an unexpected source in a different venue: Senate Majority Leader John Thune, who told CNN that in terms of Trump and Carr using the levers of government to exert leverage over late-night comics, “This isn’t an area that I think the FCC ought to be wandering into.”\n\nThune followed other GOP senators, as well as conservative podcasters like Joe Rogan, in expressing discomfort with Trump and Carr’s tactics in seeking to silence criticism.\n\nKimmel’s most significant line in his widely seen Tuesday monologue centered on the larger issues at play, saying, “This show is not important. What is important is that we get to live in a country that allows us to have a show like this.”\n\nDespite the huge audience that greeted his return, the ABC affiliate groups that are still balking at airing the show means Kimmel is hardly out of the woods in keeping “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” alive and viable. Yet if the larger fight isn’t over, Fox News’ muted response suggests he clearly won this round.","summary":"The all-over-the-map reactions to the ABC host's return from the conservative network suggest Kimmel won this round of the larger battle\n\n\nThe post How Well Did Jimmy Kimmel Do in His Return to TV?

Stewart suggested on his podcast, which featured an interview with Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin, that her decision was “reverse affirmative action” and an example of Democrats not believing their own rhetoric. (RELATED: Kayleigh McEnany Derides Kamala Harris For Blaming Biden White House For Bad Reputation)\n\n“The reason we’ve lost trust is because people don’t believe that we actually believe the shit we’re selling them, that we’re saying, we’re telling them what they want to hear,” Martin said before Stewart interrupted him.\n\n“To my point in the book, when she says, ‘I didn’t go with Pete Buttigieg ’cause he’s gay and that’d be too far,'” Stewart said. “And you’re like, ‘Oh my God, it’s actually reverse affirmative action.’ It’s like, ‘What!?'”\n\nHarris also appeared to blame President Donald Trump for her selection of Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz over Buttigieg on MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” on Monday.\n\n“No, no, no, that’s not what I said, that, that’s, that he couldn’t be on the ticket because he is gay. My point is, as I write in the book, is that I was clear that in 107 days, in one of the most hotly contested elections for president of the United States against someone like Donald Trump, who knows no floor, to be a black woman running for president of the United States, and as a vice presidential running mate, a gay man,” Harris said. “With the stakes being so high, it made me very sad. But I also realized it would be a real risk.”\n\nThe former vice president hastened to assure host Rachel Maddow that she supported the “LGBT community.”\n\n“You know, I’ve been an advocate and an ally of… of the LGBT community my entire life,” she said. “So it wasn’t about it wasn’t about… so it wasn’t about any, any prejudice on my part, but that we had such a short, we had such a short period of time and the stakes were so high.”\n\n“I think Pete is a phenomenal, phenomenal public servant and I think America is and would be ready for that,” she continued. “But at when I had to make that decision with two weeks to go, you know, and maybe I was being too cautious, you know, I’ll let our friends, we should all talk about that.”\n\nMoreover, Buttigieg told Politico on Sept. 18 that he was “surprised” to read what Harris wrote and that he believed in “giving Americans more credit” than presuming they were unwilling to vote for a presidential ticket featuring a black woman and a gay man.\n\n“My experience in politics has been that the way that you earn trust with voters is based mostly on what they think you’re going to do for their lives, not on categories,” Buttigieg told the outlet.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

I get it. I get it.”\n\nProtestors at the event in The Town Hall venue in Manhattan halted the event with “repeated interruptions,” The Washington Post reported. Protestors were also seen outside of the venue, bearing Palestinian flags and signs that read ‘Harris: Genocide is your legacy’ and ‘717 Days of Genocide,’ according to the Post.\n\n“You guys, listen, please, I actually also write about this, ok?” Harris said. “Which is — about what I know about how and why you are saying what you are saying now, and how I felt about it.

The war in Gaza is not a binary issue, but too often the conversation about it is,” Harris added. “I wanted to acknowledge the complexity, nuance, and history of the region, but it seemed very few people had the appetite for that or the willingness to hold two tragic narratives in their mind at the same time, to grieve for human suffering both Israeli and Palestinian.”\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

But if we waited for some personal stories about working with me and what qualities he had seen that led him to endorse me, they weren't there.\"'Reckless' DecisionsElsewhere, Harris recounts the ongoing discussion of whether or not Biden should have even considered dropping out of the race, revealing how much former First Lady Jill Biden played a part in her husband's decision to run again.\n\n\"'It's Joe and Jill's decision.' We all said that, like a mantra, as if we'd all been hypnotized. Was it grace, or was it recklessness?\" she wondered in her book.\n\nHarris continues: \"In retrospect, I think it was recklessness. The stakes were simply too high. This wasn’t a choice that should have been left to an individual’s ego, an individual’s ambition. It should have been more than a personal decision.\"Biden's TurnBiden's camp was bracing for a drubbing even before the book's release, and reportedly were ready to counter any spilled tea by sharing secrets of their own.\n\nPresidential expert Leon Wagener said: \"Kamala has a chip on her shoulder and she's been told by everybody in the party to keep her mouth shut or 'we'll bury you.'\n\n\"Everyone knows there is a deep well of dislike and distrust between them – and it's going to be an all-out war if she talks and the Biden team goes after her.\"\n\nPolitical reporter Mark Halperin claimed before the book Biden was preparing to bite back: \"If the Biden people feel threatened, you will hear stories about Kamala Harris as vice president that will not make her look good.\n\n\"I'm telling you, if Joe Biden feels threatened, if his people feel threatened by her, this is going to escalate in a big way.\"","summary":"The former vice president complains in her new memoir she wasn't treated warmly by Biden or his staff during her hurried campaign.","url":"https://radaronline.com/p/kamala-harris-complicated-relationship-joe-biden-hurt-disappointment-campaign-book/","image":"https://media.radaronline.com/brand-img/JUJ261GbQ/0x0/kamala-harris-joe-biden-duo-1758825634176.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-25 20:06:29","author":"Daniel Gura","authors":["Daniel Gura"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.398},{"id":363510216,"title":"Senate Majority Leader John Thune on Jimmy Kimmel & Free Speech | #trending","text":"Senate Majority Leader John Thune on Jimmy Kimmel ...\n\nFormer California Republican Governor Arnold Schwa...\n\nKartik Aaryan and Vidya Balan learning garba toget...\n\nSaree goals?

During a heated NewsNight segment, conservative radio host Ben Ferguson tore into California Governor Gavin Newsom for calling the Trump administration “authoritarians” and “fascists,” arguing that loaded language fuels violence. \n\nPhillip paused the debate, then rolled a montage of Donald Trump calling his opponents “communists,” “Marxists,” and “fascists,” putting Ferguson’s logic in question. The supercut came right after Ferguson agreed that branding people with words like “fascist” can lead to violence.\n\nThe timing could not have been better. The segment aired amid a partisan brawl over rhetoric in the wake of a deadly shooting at an ICE facility in Dallas. The tragedy triggered a political firestorm, with critics blasting Democrats for demonizing immigration enforcement, and Democrats pointing back at years of hard-right fire from Trump and his allies.\n\nPhillip pressed Ferguson on the core claim. If certain labels are too dangerous to use, should they be off limits for everyone. Then came the supercut. In clip after clip, Trump labels Joe Biden and Kamala Harris “radical left communist Marxist fascists,” and frames the election as a choice between “communism and freedom.” The juxtaposition undercut the idea that only one side’s words are dangerous. It also echoed earlier moments when networks used compilations to test consistency claims.\n\nFerguson tried to steer back to policy, saying that when leaders “demonize law enforcement,” it invites attacks on ICE. Phillip granted the general point about demonization, but did not let go of the double standard, asking if he wanted to ban those words outright or only when political opponents say them. The exchange left Ferguson threading a needle, condemning some rhetoric while giving his own side more room.\n\nThe broader fight did not start in the studio. Newsom has been at the center of a separate storm over immigration enforcement, from signing a California law that limits ICE tactics to ripping the administration’s approach. Conservatives say his language helped light a fuse before the Dallas shooting, while Newsom and his allies argue Republicans have normalized apocalyptic talk for years. The back-and-forth spread quickly across cable and social media, keeping the focus on how leaders talk about each other, and about law enforcement.\n\nOn one side, conservatives say words like “authoritarian” and “fascist” dehumanize officers and inflame unstable actors. On the other side, Phillip’s montage shows Trump deploying the same labels against his rivals, often to cheers at rallies. The point was less about a single politician and more about a mirror. If language is the accelerant, the standard has to run on both sides of the political aisle.\n\nIn the end, the clip did what good TV does: it cut through spin with something undeniable on tape. Whether the moment changes minds is another question. But for one night, a debate about dangerous words ended with the loudest voice in the conservative movement speaking for himself, on loop, and a MAGA guest left to explain why those words only count when someone else says them.","summary":"CNN's Abby Phillip rolls the tape, and a MAGA pundit runs out of excuses.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/cnn-cuts-off-maga-guest-with-supercut-of-trumps-own-words","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Ben-Ferguson.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-25 18:45:00","author":"Cnn,Frank Yemi","authors":["Cnn","Frank Yemi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.49},{"id":363505246,"title":"Stephen A. Smith Torches Crockett, AOC And Newsom In Blistering Rant","text":"SiriusXM’s Stephen A. Smith rebuked Democratic Reps. Jasmine Crockett of Texas and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, along with Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom, on “Straight Shooter” on Wednesday.\n\nRepublicans lead Democrats by 7% on the economy, 13% on immigration and 22% on crime, according to a Washington Post/Ipsos poll conducted Sept. 11 to 15. During a rant on his show about Democratic political strategy, Smith condemned Crockett’s rhetoric, cast doubt on Ocasio-Cortez’s presidential viability and scrutinized Newsom’s record. (RELATED: Democrats Divided Over Whether They Should Keep Calling Trump ‘Wannabe Hitler’ Post Charlie Kirk Assassination)\n\n“Jasmine Crockett, you’re calling [Presidential Donald Trump] everything under the sun,” Smith said. “How’s that going to work if it serves to alienate folks because they’re saying you’re just him on the other side of the aisle acting the same way you’re accusing him of acting, and then you get dismissed?”\n\nCrockett has called Trump an “enemy to the United States” and repeatedly compared him to Hitler.\n\n“AOC, I believe, can win the Senate seat in New York over Chuck Schumer!” Smith added. “I don’t think she’ll win the presidency.”\n\nThe SiriusXM host then turned his attention to Newsom, whom he said he believes will be pursuing the presidency in 2028.\n\n“You going to pull it off with the record that took place in California all of these years under your stewardship!? It’s nice to see him sticking his chest out and going off!” Smith said. “You think they don’t have clips of how you embraced extreme leftist policies during the whole woke movement and cancel culture and everything else!?”\n\n“You think they didn’t see people getting arrested and let out of jail the same day!? You think they don’t have footage of crime ravaging the streets of Los Angeles or homelessness!?” he added. “You think they don’t know about the cost of living and how it’s the highest in this republic right now!?”\n\nHomelessness has been a pervasive issue in California for several years under Newsom’s tenure, with the state allocating billions of dollars attempting to tackle it. The governor has attributed the problem on California’s policies that have prevented adequate housing construction.\n\nWhile Newsom claimed that neither he nor his office used the term “Latinx” during a March episode of “This Is Gavin Newsom,” CNN proved him wrong later the same month, showing footage and past social media posts.\n\nNewsom leads the pack of potential 2028 Democrats with 21% among registered voters who are Democrats or Democratic-leaning Independents, while Ocasio-Cortez is in third place with 12%, according to a Yahoo/YouGov poll conducted from Aug. 29 to Sept. 2. Former Vice President Kamala Harris ranked second at 19%.\n\nCNN chief data analyst Harry Enten expressed surprise on Monday at how closely Ocasio-Cortez trails Newsom because of how “liberal” she is. She is a Democratic Socialist and one of the authors of the “Green New Deal,” a multi-trillion dollar proposal to move the U.S. toward net-zero emissions and guarantee jobs in the process.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Indeed, in their responses to this whole kerfuffle, Democrats have revealed that their solution is not a solution at all, but a threat to up the ante the second they regain power.\n\nTo recap, Kimmel's removal from the airwaves has alarmed many defenders of free speech—not because Kimmel has the right to a stage, a show, and an audience, but because the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) involved itself in a decision that should be made by private entities. By threatening to take regulatory action against media companies that platform Kimmel, FCC chair Brendan Carr earned a rare rebuke from several members of his own party, including Republican Sens. Ted Cruz (Texas), Rand Paul (Ky.), and Dave McCormick (Pa.).\n\nWhen a government actor tries to extort a private actor into taking some action, it's called jawboning. In this case, the desired action was the silencing of Kimmel, who used his show's opening monologue last week to imply that the alleged killer of Charlie Kirk, Tyler Robinson, was part of the \"MAGA gang,\" i.e., that the shooter was identified with the right. This was neither funny nor true. Kimmel can and should suffer the market consequences of his claims: His viewers can desert him, his bosses can punish him, and companies that broadcast him can find something else to air in the 11 p.m. hour. The government shouldn't force him off television, however, and the FCC shouldn't imply that it will makes things very difficult for his corporate masters unless they muzzle him.\n\nLike I said last week, there's absolutely nothing unprecedented about what's going on here. Carr's directly threatening language—address the Kimmel situation \"the easy way or the hard way\"—was perhaps a less subtle example of jawboning, but it's well in keeping with the previous administration's actions on disfavored speech. Biden White House Digital Strategy Director Rob Flaherty, for instance, repeatedly pressed social media companies to take down content that was contrary to Biden's interest.\n\nSo perhaps it should come as no surprise that Democrats are not responding to the Kimmel situation by demanding some new limit on the FCC's ability to regulate speech. They are not vowing that a future Democratic administration would respect the sacrosanct First Amendment rights of private speech. On the contrary, they are promising to punish the victims of the jawboning—the private companies.\n\nSen. Chris Murphy (D–Conn.) made this explicit during a recent interview on MSNBC.\n\nMurphy: \"The second remedy is for the Democratic Party to make clear that if you give us power, we're gonna break up these corporate monopolies, and in particular these media monopolies … if we want to be credible as a critic of Trump's slide to totalitarianism, then we have to… pic.twitter.com/cjIHBcF0IP\n— Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) September 25, 2025\n\nMurphy said that if the Democrats regained control of the presidency and Congress, they would move swiftly to regulate and break up large media companies—and presumably, Big Tech companies—that kowtowed to Trump. If you think about it, what he's basically saying is kowtow to us, not the GOP, or else!\n\nOne can't help but feel a little sympathetic to the owners of the companies, who really just want to be left alone, make profit-maximizing decisions, and avoid punitive regulation. But they're damned if they do—MAGA will hurt them—and damned if they don't—Democrats will hurt them.\n\nAs long as Democrats remain the party that is more inclined to favor sweeping regulatory action aimed at breaking up the largest and most successful tech and media companies in the U.S.—in other words, the party of Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders—the Republican Party might seem like the more welcoming team, even if Trump is as bad a jawboner (heh) as anyone else.\n\nSpeaking of Censorship\n\nYouTube has announced that everyone kicked off the platform for violating pandemic-era content rules is now welcome back, following an investigation by House Judiciary Committee Chair Jim Jordan (R–Ohio) into the Biden administration's jawboning of parent company Alphabet. Reason's Elizabeth Nolan Brown had an excellent write-up of this decision in her own newsletter, so I won't dwell on it in too much detail.\n\nI am particularly satisfied by this outcome, however, since my show, Rising, was unjustly suppressed by YouTube in 2022. The platform suspended us for a week, ostensibly because we violated an election integrity policy: denying the validity of the 2020 election. But of course, no one on the show made any such claim—rather, we played a news clip of Trump making the claim. In any case, it's always nice to get some recognition that the moderation policies of that era were heavy-handed and motivated by government malfeasance.\n\nHere was my commentary on Thursday's episode of Rising, discussing YouTube's change of heart.\n\nThis Week on Free Media\n\nI'm joined by Amber Duke to discuss Kamala Harris's revenge tour, and much else. Also, I'm currently recording an episode with Andrew Heaton, which will debut later this week!\n\nWorth Watching\n\nI just finished two things I've been working on: The second season of Netflix's Wednesday, and the Cormac McCarthy novel Blood Meridian. One is a timeless meditation on man's inherent capacity for violence and the savage roots of the American experiment, and the other is about cowboys.","summary":"Democrats are vowing to break up media companies that kowtowed to Trump if they take back power.","url":"https://reason.com/2025/09/25/democrats-to-trump-stop-jawboning-thats-our-job/","image":"https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/09/P20220608ES-0526_52258737704.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-25 18:30:08","author":"Robby Soave","authors":["Robby Soave"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.308},{"id":363526434,"title":"Barack Obama Hints at Major Marriage Issues With Wife Michelle as Former First Couple are 'Secretly Divorcing'","text":"Rumors of Barack and Michelle Obama parting ways have reignited after the former president admitted to having marriage issues, RadarOnline.com can reveal.\n\nDuring a conversation with historian David Olusoga at the O2 Arena in London, Barack opened up about the dark times his relationship has seen following his time in the White House.What Did Barack Say?\"I was digging myself out of the hole I found myself with Michelle,\" Barack said during the event on Wednesday, September 25. \"Now I'm at about level ground.\"\n\nThe 64-year-old's comments came after the former First Couple were spotted together for the first time in months in Portofino, Italy, as they both stepped on director Steven Spielberg's $250million superyacht this past weekend.

So we had a lot of fun times, a lot of adventures, and I have become a better person because of the man I'm married to.\"\n\nHowever, the 61-year-old has also admitted to having tough times with her man, as she previously said: \"People think I'm being catty for saying this: it's like, there were 10 years where I couldn't stand my husband...\"\n\n\"Marriage isn't 50/50, ever,\" she added. \"There are times I'm 70, he's 30. There are times he's 60, 40.\"\n\nDespite the ups and downs, Michelle later elaborated she's sticking by Barack: \"We've been married for 30 years, and we will be married forever.

And if 10 of those years were bad, you know, anybody would take those odds.\"Splitting Up Their Millions?While both Barack and Michelle are trying their best to hit back at rumors, speculation is still running rampant, with one insider claiming the pair are quietly attempting to divide their $70million empire.\n\nA source previously claimed: \"They want to have everything ironed out in advance. The last thing they want is an ugly fight with lots of nasty legal filings.\"\n\nThey continued: \"They have homes in D.C., Martha's Vineyard, and Chicago-plus a stock portfolio in excess of $25million. There are also substantial revenue streams from their various media projects to divide and manage going forward.\n\n\"It's far from easy to untangle a life of three decades with someone, but maintaining the illusion of a happy and stable marriage is no longer a solution. They both are of the mind that they will be better off on their own.\"Another insider claimed the couple were enjoying their \"separate lives\" at the moment, before things took a turn when Barack wanted to dip his toe into the political side of things again.\n\nThe source claimed: \"They'd already been living separate lives on opposite coasts for some time, but that was no longer an option after Michelle refused to run and Barack was forced to back Kamala (Harris)...\"","summary":"Barack Obama appeared to open up about his marriage to wife Michelle, hinting the couple has been confronted with tough times.","url":"https://radaronline.com/p/barack-obama-michelle-marriage-issues-secretly-divorcing/","image":"https://media.radaronline.com/brand-img/t_RfV4w6b/0x0/barack-obama-michelle-marriage-issues-secretly-divorcing-pp-1758823021041.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-25 18:30:00","author":"Bryan Brunati","authors":["Bryan Brunati"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.147},{"id":363505238,"title":"‘You Will Be The Next Charlie’: Glenn Youngkin Urges Crowd To Continue Kirk’s Legacy","text":"Republican Virginia Gov.

Youngkin said at the Virginia Tech rally that he viewed the attendees as “the next Charlie.” (RELATED: ‘I Did See Him Fall’: Jason Chaffetz Provides Eyewitness Account Of Charlie Kirk Shooting)\n\n“I wish Charlie were here tonight. I wish we were engaging in that amazing moment where Charlie speaks truth, there is a dialogue, a respect, a recognition of the beauty of freedom of expression,” Youngkin said. “And we will have that tonight. But I know we all wish Charlie was here.”\n\n“But see, the truth is that the question that has been asked over and over again is, ‘Who will be the next Charlie?’ And as I look out in this room and I see thousands of you, I want to repeat the best answer that I have heard,” he continued. “You will be the next Charlie.

The former vice president writes of a time her and her husband got in an argument on her birthday, which ended with a staffer intervening to fix the situation. (RELATED: Kamala Humiliates Tim Walz One Last Time By Revealing Why She Chose Him For VP)\n\n“Throughout the flight, I was looking forward to a special evening with Doug. Though we were apart a lot those days, campaigning in different cities, for my birthday our staff conspired so that we’d meet up in Philadelphia,” Harris writes of celebrating her 60th birthday on the campaign trail.\n\n“I was wondering what he’d planned for our evening. The simple answer: Nothing. Not a thing,” she says.\n\nThe former vice president adds that she did not realize at the time how the campaign and the attacks on her had worn on her husband. Harris then lists all the ways she says Emhoff didn’t meet expectations on her birthday.\n\n“He hadn’t put any thought into where we’d stay that night, so staff had picked a place for us that they thought would be a bit more special than the usual campaign hotel,” Harris writes.\n\nShe then details how one of her aides had picked two special restaurants for the couple to eat at to celebrate Harris’ birthday. The aide asked Emhoff for help on the menu, but he shrugged and told the official to ask Harris, according to the book.\n\n“Doug at least had thought to get a gift for me,” the former vice president writes, noting that the pair of earrings he had gotten her was from the same designer who made the gift he got her for their anniversary.\n\n“When I turned it over, I saw that the pearls’ backing had been engraved with the date. How thoughtful, to commemorate the milestone of my big birthday. But then I looked closer,” Harris writes.\n\n“The date was not my birthday. It was the date of our wedding anniversary. He’d obviously intended to give me both pieces on our anniversary, until it occurred to him that by repurposing one piece, he could kill two birds with one stone,” she continues.\n\nThe final straw was after Harris went to take a bath, forgot a towel and had a hard time reaching Emhoff for help, according to her book.\n\n“And then we got into it. The stress had finally gotten to both of us. It was one of those fights that every married couple has had,” Harris writes. “But we weren’t every married couple. Doug stopped the argument cold. As soon as his words were out, the truth of them landed on me like a bucket of ice water. ‘We can’t turn on each other.'”\n\nAfter revealing how the dispute ended, the former vice president explains that her aide —referred to as Storm in the book — ordered the former Second Gentleman to fix the mess Harris believed he created.\n\n“The next day she told Doug, ‘Mr. Second Gentleman, you have to fix this.’ She handed him a set of note cards. She’d numbered them one through five, for the nights we’d be apart through the end of the campaign. She instructed him to write a note on each one,” the former vice president writes.\n\n“From then till the election, no matter what city each of us had landed in, at the end of the day I would find a note on my pillow, in Doug’s chicken scratch, telling me how much he loved me,” she concludes.","summary":"'We weren’t every married couple'","url":"https://dailycaller.com/2025/09/25/kamala-harris-doug-emhoff-2024-campaign-trail-argument-love-letters-aide/","image":"https://images.dailycaller.com/image/width=1280,height=549,fit=cover,format=webp,f=auto/https://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2194336682-scaled-e1758816983898.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-25 16:51:38","author":"Reagan Reese","authors":["Reagan Reese"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.056},{"id":363434494,"title":"Fox News ‘Antisemitism Exposed’ Newsletter: UN Ambassador Waltz takes on the haters","text":"Fox News' \"Antisemitism Exposed\" newsletter brings you stories on the rising anti-Jewish prejudice across the U.S. and the world. IN TODAY’S NEWSLETTER: - Waltz vows to root out antisemitism, eliminate 'woke' programs, at United Nations- Hate crime charge for suspect in Florida synagogue arson- Kamala accuses Biden of offering Israel 'perceived blank check' in Hamas war TOP STORY: Newly confirmed U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Michael Waltz will work to \"Make the U.N. great again,\" while working to root out antisemitism, eliminate \"woke\" programs and become more aggressive in telecommunications, aviation, space and more, sources familiar with his priorities told Fox News Digital. Waltz, a retired Army National Guard colonel and former Green Beret, previously served as a House Republican from Florida before being tapped to serve as Trump’s national security advisor. VIDEO: Daily Wire co-founder Ben Shapiro joined \"The Sunday Briefing\" to react to American allies formally recognizing Palestine as a state. WATCH HERE: HATE IGNITED: The man suspected of setting a fire inside a Florida synagogue has been charged with a hate crime, authorities said Monday. Blake Richard Hoover, 31, of Charlotte County, was charged with arson and criminal mischief for the blaze that broke out at the Chabad of Charlotte County in Punta Gorda on Friday. NEW EXCUSE: In her new book, former Vice President Kamala Harris suggests that President Joe Biden's unpopularity harmed her 2024 presidential bid, writing that among the issues hurting her was the president's \"perceived blank check to [Israeli leader] Benjamin Netanyahu in Gaza.\" ISRAEL DERANGEMENT SYNDROME: The shooter who killed a man and wounded two other adults during a wedding at a New Hampshire country club on Saturday yelled \"Free Palestine\" as the chaos unfolded, according to a witness. The New Hampshire Attorney General's Office identified the suspect as 23-year-old Hunter Nadeau. He is accused of fatally shooting 59-year-old Steven DeCesare. Authorities said there is no known connection between the two men. 'GRIP OF TERROR': A leading independent watchdog organization published a report this work on how the Hamas terrorist movement took control over the education system in Gaza and Lebanon from the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). The watchdog group — UN Watch — titled its 220-page report \"Schools in the Grip of Terror: How UNRWA Allowed Hamas Chiefs to Control Its Education System.\" HATE RISES: A shocking new report has found that Jew-hatred in the U.S. dramatically spiked in August. The report from the Combat Antisemitism Movement monitored 694 antisemitic global incidents, an average of 22.4 incidents per day. The volume of antisemitism amounts to more than15.7% more incidents worldwide compared with August 2024. The United States recorded the highest number of antisemitism incidents in August, with 162 incidents. That represented a 13.3% increase from the 143 incidents recorded in July, noted the CAM report. GUEST EDITORIAL: Yoav Gallant, former Israeli defense minister and retired IDF major general, writes that Israel's decades-long effort to work in good faith with the UN has proven hopeless. He cites a new report from the world body that condemns Israel while barely mentioning Hamas' network of tunnels, ceaseless attacks on Israel and even the fact that it still holds hostages two years after the Oct. 7 attack.

We all hope to have support from those who come before. Sometimes it happens, sometimes it doesn't. And certainly that's true of politics. Hillary Clinton is one of those people that believes in lifting people up and supporting people,\" Harris said from the stage of The Town Hall, a theater venue in midtown Manhattan, where she kicked off her book tour that will take her across the country in the coming weeks. \"And she follows through,\" Harris said. Harris released her new book Tuesday, which reflects on her experiences on the 2024 campaign trail as the Democratic presidential nominee after Biden dropped out of the race on July 21, 2024, amid mounting concerns over his mental acuity. OBAMA, PELOSI, OTHER TOP DEMS RESISTED INSTANT HARRIS ENDORSEMENT CITING NEED TO 'EARN IT,' 'HIKING' EXCUSE The 300-page memoir takes a handful of shots at Biden and his leadership as president, including arguing it was reckless for the octogenarian president to run for re-election, describing that Biden staffers did little to defend her from negative press when she served as vice president, as well as critiques of Biden's botched debate against Donald Trump that ultimately served as a death knell for Biden's re-election efforts. The book, including excerpts that were released in the lead-up to it hitting store shelves, set off condemnation from former White House staffers who claimed Harris was attempting to scapegoat Biden instead of owning her own alleged failures. Harris told the crowds at the theater that the book was not focused on Biden, but instead on her personal experiences on the campaign trail, and her efforts to \"fight\" and \"win.\" And as she launched that fight, she said, Clinton, as well as former President Bill Clinton, had been rallying support for her campaign since the moment Biden dropped out. KAMALA HARRIS BREAKS SILENCE ON BIDEN DROPOUT, ADMITS SHE HAS REGRETS ABOUT HER HANDLING OF SITUATION Harris set the scene for the day Biden dropped out, telling the audience that she was in the midst of cooking a pancake breakfast for her young great-nieces who were enjoying the last days of their summer before they headed back to school, when she got a number from a blocked call. \"I got my old Howard sweatshirt on … so I was there in my sweats when my phone rang from a blocked number and there's only one person who did that. So I answered the phone, ‘Hey Joe, Mr. President,’ and, and then he told me he wasn't gonna run,\" she said. \"And so then all hell broke loose,\" she continued. Harris said she began making calls, including to the Clintons' home phone number. \"So I have their home number, for Hillary and Bill, and it was the cutest thing. So I called and Hillary picked up and then Bill was in the other room, and she's like, ‘It’s Kamala on the phone, Bill, pick up the other phone,'\" she recounted. Harris said that the former first couple immediately offered to travel to campaign for her presidential ticket, including taking public transportation. HARRIS TAPS DEM EMAILS LISTS TO MARKET NEW BOOK, SPARKING PARTY NEUTRALITY CONCERNS The former vice president included anecdotes of the exchange in her book as well, saying Hillary Clinton offered to hop on an Amtrak train to help her campaign, while Bill Clinton told her, \"Send me anywhere.\" \"Hillary: We’re thrilled the president endorsed you. We’ll do whatever we can—we’ll jump on a plane, we’ll get on Amtrak. I want to be part of your war council,\" her book reads, according to notes she jotted down during the call. \"Bill: Oh my God, I’m so relieved! Send me anywhere. Make this your own campaign,\" the book added of the former president's reaction. Harris focused her talk Wednesday evening on the future of the party, her support of \"rising stars\" among Democrat politicians, as well as providing readers a real-life discussion of the anecdotes on her failed 2024 election. The event yielded a packed house, as well as pro-Gaza protesters who banged drums and chanted outside the venue during the event, including accusing Harris of \"setting Palestine on fire\" amid the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas. Harris' book tour launch included continuing claims that the 2024 election was \"the closest\" of this century, as well as a handful of attacks on Trump, including lambasting him as one who \"lied\" to the public on the campaign trail about bringing costs down for Americans.

You can watch this interview here.\n\nPerry Bacon: Good morning, everybody. I’m Perry Bacon. I’m the host of the New Republic show Right Now. I’m really excited and honored to be joined by a special guest today. It’s E.J. Dionne, who was one of my former colleagues at The Washington Post, a longtime columnist. He’s now a contributing writer at The New York Times. He’s also a professor at Georgetown. He’s also one of the smartest, wisest, most thoughtful people about politics for several decades now. So somebody, I think my guess is everyone who’s watching, will have read and will have liked. You’ve also probably seen him on TV, on PBS or MSNBC or heard him on NPR. So I could go on and on and on. E.J. also is a very nice, optimistic, humble, great person to be around. And that’s more unusual in high-level politics than I wish it were. So E.J., glad to see you. Welcome.\n\nE.J. Dionne: May I do this every day, Perry? That was the sweetest, kindest introduction I think I’ve ever gotten. And right back at you, as you know, I have been such a big fan of yours ever since you started out—since, to your benefit, you are a bit younger than I am. And I’m just so honored to be here with you. Thank you so much.\n\nPerry Bacon: So let me start. We were talking about something that I don’t know much about, which is that there were two congressional races last night that were decided. So talk about that a little bit, E.J.\n\nDionne: Yeah. There was one last night and one a little earlier this summer. And what’s significant is not [that] the Democrats won them.\n\nBacon: One in Arizona was last night. \n\nDionne: Correct. You know, the earlier this summer for Jerry Connolly, the Democratic Congressman that died and James Walkinshaw was the Democratic nominee in 2024. Jerry Connolly won big two to one. Walkinshaw won by three to one. Last night in Arizona, the daughter of former Congressman Grijalva, Adelita Grijalva, won her dad’s district. But again, looking at the votes count so far, about last I looked, about 87 percent in, she was running maybe 10, 15 points ahead of her father, even in a very Democratic district. So I think that tells you something that’s going on out there. By the way, the new Congresswoman would be the 218th signature on the discharge petition to try to force a vote on releasing the Epstein files. We’ll see if any of the Republicans on that petition drop off. Otherwise, there’s going to be some action there. I mean, discharge petitions are very hard to execute. I’m sure that Speaker Johnson will try to stop it, but that’s significant. \n\nWhat does all this show us? The other thing, and we were talking a bit about this before we started, the polling number I pay a lot of attention to for any president is not just approval or disapproval. A lot of the polls ask, do you strongly approve of X or strongly disapprove of X?\n\nAnd that number really shows a lot about where the energy is in the electorate. And I looked up yesterday the latest Economist YouGov poll. What you’ve got is 48 percent of the country strongly disapprove of President Trump. Only 24 percent strongly approve. That’s less than half his vote. Two things about that. One, it shows that everything Trump has done so far has not only ignited his opposition, obviously, but it hasn’t really appealed to parts of his base. They may say they still approve of him, but there’s no enthusiasm there. And that number has been quite predictive, not directly, but indirectly predictive of turnout in midterm elections.\n\nAnd if you’re an incumbent president, you don’t want to go into a midterm with only 24 percent of the people strongly approving of you. So I think, you know, I think there’s a lot of despair and anger. And believe me, I’m somebody, I’m usually... quite an optimistic person, a friend once accused me of being a ‘feliciopath,’ which is a great term. And I share a lot of the alarm of a lot of people. But I think that we should have some confidence in the broad electorate that a lot of people are looking at all this And they’re saying, this isn’t what we voted for. This isn’t what we wanted. And so I think,\n\nyou know, there is, you know, I think Trump is losing the argument with the electorate. And we’ll see how much power he’s willing to exercise to try to push back against that.\n\nBacon: It looks like in a lot of ways the polling is in this 2006-2018 zone where the president is unpopular. The one difference being we don’t know if they’re going to try to gerrymander every seat possible to prevent a loss. But in a pure polling sense, they’re in real trouble right now. He is fairly unpopular. And even though the Democratic Party is not looking popular polling-wise, in a midterm, usually it’s a vote against the incumbent if they’re unpopular. \n\nDionne: Just on that point, Steve Kornacki did a great bit on MSNBC, I think it was, a few weeks ago, where he showed next to each other attitudes toward the Democratic Party, which were negative, and how people would vote in the midterms. And if I remember right, the Dems had a four or five point lead on the midterms.\n\nSo a lot of that negative on the Democratic Party comes from Democrats. who want the party to push back harder or this or that. But when push comes to shove, they’re still voting Democratic. And I think you’re seeing that in the two big, two of the three big races this November.\n\nAnd actually you’re seeing it in Zohran Mamdani’s race too. But in Virginia and New Jersey, Democrats, Abigail Spanberger in Virginia and Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey are running well ahead. So people can be mad at the Democrats, dislike them, but still end up voting for them. And I think that’s going to be something we’ll keep an eye on for a long time.\n\nBacon: Speaking of positive news, I want to emphasize free speech and people have been silenced. There are people who have been, you know, there are people who have been deported for or people who’ve been arrested for their op-eds. And, you know, the college students have this... We’re not in a great environment. That’s said, it is great to see that Jimmy Kimmel was, you know, back within a week. His suspension was ended. ABC backed down. Disney backed down. Even the Trump administration on some level appears to have conceded they lost this fight. And what he said last night was I think it’s worth quoting from. I think it’s something he said, “this show is not important. What is important is that we get to live in a country that allows us to have a show like this.” And I did not I’ll be honest, I was not I’m not a huge Jimmy Kimmel watcher.\n\nI think maybe Stephen Colbert is a more interesting host, to be totally honest. But I’m proud of Jimmy Kimmel in this moment. I think he’s done something really useful. I think he’s been a forceful figure. I love the fact that people from all walks of life have combined actors... Barack Obama, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, all these people,\n\nregular Americans saying, I will cancel Disney Plus because of this. We have seen a useful moment of resistance here that I’m really excited about. How do you feel about E.J.?\n\nDionne: Did you ever expect that so early in your podcast, you would be praising Ted Cruz? That was an amazing moment. God bless Jimmy Kimmel, if I may say that. I think that you’re absolutely right in everything you underscored. I think, you know, point number one, he didn’t back down. He was polite. He said he didn’t want to offend anybody, which he obviously didn’t. But he was really strong that De Niro Mafia routine was just so powerful. You know, just a powerful message got sent by that. And the fact that he did not use his script to grovel or to appease anybody, but to come right out there as strongly as possible to defend free speech. \n\nAnd again, I think, you know, I’m now returning to my ‘feliciopath’ roots here. But I think it is really significant that, a corporate sponsor, the ABC yanked him, just yanked him. And the backlash against that really mattered. And I think it shows that going forward, there is economic power that individual people have to send a message that, okay, if you’re going to play along with these authoritarian actions, you got a problem with a lot of the people who watch these shows, people who make, you know, make shows for these networks in the case of ABC. And so, you know, I don’t want to exaggerate it. We still got a heap of trouble in front of us, but I thought it was very significant. And I thought it’s hard to think how Kimmel could handle that better. And, you know, I think it’s important that he did. I think the other thing we need to point out is, you know, a whole bunch of stations, the Sinclair Nextar stations didn’t carry him. I think there’s another fight we’re going to see going forward about... You know, what happens with those stations?\n\nHow do people in local communities react to that sort of thing? It’s about, I think, a quarter of ABC’s affiliates. You know, we’ll see. I think that’s the next kind of conversation we’re going to have. But this was a win.\n\nBacon: And I don’t want to make this a Washington Post podcast, but I do want to note that our former colleague who, Karen Attiah, stayed on at the Post after they decided to impose their personal liberties and free markets ideology, and then they seemed to have fired her last week on what I think are sort of trumped up reasons. So we are not, and she has actually made some great statements about the importance of free speech and civil discourse as well. So I want to emphasize that it’s not just Jimmy Kimmel.\n\nA lot of people are fighting corporations and the Trump administration to speak out and we should like rally behind all of them.\n\nDionne: Yeah. And you know what’s important? I think it’s really important to stand up for people, whether you agree with them or not. I’m not referencing Karen here particularly. I’m referencing anybody. And, you know, and I think that it is very dangerous and you saw that in the days after the killing of Charlie Kirk, which was an awful, evil thing. And we should say that. And I think people do have a right to expect people to say that a killing is awful, but... And I believe that. But you cannot use an event like this as an excuse, which the Trump administration clearly wants to do, not only to go after sort of individual people, which is bad. They really are talking about using it to go after opposition groups.\n\nYou know, this executive order banning an idea, basically, Antifa. And as somebody said the other day, aren’t we an anti-fascist country? Didn’t we fight a war to defeat fascism and are still proud of the men and women who fought in that war all these years later? Yeah, so I agree with you. It’s very important to stand up for everyone whose speech is threatened right now. And by the way, that would include our friends on the right.\n\nBacon: Yes. Yeah, exactly. Whatever cancel culture means. And, you know, I’ve never been for people losing their jobs or their or particularly their freedom for whatever they write or what they say. The first image should apply to everybody. I think that’s an important point. And I want to disagree with people, but be in spaces where we’re allowed to disagree without it being so threatening. And we’ve you know, this and this government really is opposed to that.\n\nDionne: And just by the way, an important point you just made there, you know, this is one step beyond the cancel culture. \n\nBacon: This is what I’m trying to say. \n\nDionne: And we can have a whole conversation, and I tend to be a free speech absolutist, but this is using government power against people. And, you know,\n\nand I think that that is something, as Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, and a few others showed, is something that conservatives should oppose.\n\nBacon: So government funding expires September 30th. Schumer and Jeffries did two things I think are important. One is they listed some real demands, particularly around health care policy, that they want to be part of this next government funding bill. And then two, they asked Trump for a meeting to discuss this and to be formalized this.\n\nAnd Trump has said no to their demands. And yesterday said, no, I will not meet with you either. So, how do you feel? I know there was a lot of criticism in March about how the leadership handled government funding then. Like, do you think they are on the right track, Schumer and Jeffries, this time?\n\nDionne: Yeah, I think that where we are now compared to where we were then and where Chuck Schumer is now compared to where he was then tells us a lot about what happened. The last time Schumer basically said, look, if we shut down the government, we will actually be surrendering more power to Musk and Trump to make these cuts, because shutdowns really end up conceding a lot of power to the executive. I think if I had been in Congress, I still would have voted to sort of have the fight then. But I got where Schumer was coming from. And I don’t know if you had this experience, but I talked to Democrats who were opposed to what Schumer did, but basically said, yeah, I get his point. This isn’t crazy what Schumer said. I think this time there’s a very different feeling. Why is that?\n\nI think one of the principal ones and in some ways the most important demand in this shutdown is that it concerns what Trump and Russell Vaught have done to bust up deals that Democrats and Republicans in Congress made and to say, you may pass it, but we won’t spend that money. Or we’re going to send rescission bills and Republicans will pass it with a majority vote. They don’t need it.\n\nBacon: Making the budget process essentially irrelevant even after you sign the deal.\n\nDionne: Right so you know the point is if we negotiate something and it’s meaningless why should we negotiate and why should we vote for any budget when we know that what we vote for may not come to fruition because of Trump’s use of executive power so I think that is central to it. And then I think they have been very wise to put the health care issue as, you know, what they are going front and center on, particularly because the people who get health care through Obamacare, because of the cuts in the subsidies that the Republicans have supported, are going to see their premiums go up a lot in about a month.\n\nAnd so their argument that we got to deal with this now has a lot of weight. And I think that, you know, apparently Trump walked away from the negotiations because Republicans in Congress told him to and said, we think we have the upper hand here. But I do think that really strengthens the Democratic hand.\n\nAnd they’re saying we don’t want a shutdown. We want to negotiate this. And here, President Trump is saying, we won’t negotiate. So how can we give our votes to something that we oppose because it doesn’t protect healthcare? We oppose because it probably may not mean anything anyway, and you won’t even talk to us.\n\nAnd so I think that is creating a kind of consensus among Democrats. And look, shutdowns are very hard to win. But here’s the last thing. Those numbers we talked about at the beginning about Trump’s approval rating, it is easier to win a fight like this when the president is as unpopular as President Trump is now, so that there will be less of a benefit of the doubt on the Republican side of this right, I think, now than there might have been if Trump were still reasonably popular, or at least not that unpopular.\n\nBacon: We move to what I think is another element of what I think of as good news. I’ll be curious what you think. It looks like in New York, a few congressmen over the weekend endure. I think Yvette Clarke endorsed Mamdani. You know, the governor did maybe a couple weeks ago. Hakeem Jeffries sounds like he’s getting closer to that space as well. Like, I guess whatever you think of Mamdani, and I actually like what he said, he’s won the primary. He’s running with two people who are three people, but really two Cuomo and Adams who might be Democrats in name, but are not people we should be proud of as Democrats to have an office. So to me, I want to see a consolidation around Mamdani. And I think that’s finally happening. He’s done a good job keeping the door open. And I think the party, even the more, even people to his right are beginning to realize he’s going to win and he can be a team player. And I think we’re seeing a good consolidation toward him. And I think that’s a positive step. And I saw Kamala Harris, you know, endorsed him in the most enthusiastic way. But how do you feel? I feel like we’re moving toward a resolution that’ll be positive here.\n\nDionne: I think no matter what your politics are, you have to look at Mamdani and say, this is one of the most talented politicians we have seen come along in quite a while. I have sort of thought about it as a comment, a bit of a Clinton or Obama of the left in his political skills. And I wrote a piece about Mamdani where I said that the best pundits about Mamdani were the people in his middle school who gave him the award for the best smile. Because it’s really hard to say that a guy with that demeanor is some kind of dangerous radical. \n\nBacon: I agree. \n\nDionne: You know, his positions are left wing and he’s had to answer for some stuff that the national Democratic Socialists of America passed that, you know, I suspect you disagree with a bunch of that stuff, too. You know, he’s got to answer for all that. But there’s there’s a talent there. And to me, one of the lessons of what Mamdani did lies in what he started to do when he was at 1 percent in the polls. And he made these videos. And it wasn’t just he made good videos. He went to Trump voters in the Bronx and asked them, why did you vote for Donald Trump?\n\nAnd how many people expect progressives who are seen as very censorious of people who disagree with them, expect progressives to go out and say, hey, I care about what you think. I want to know. What do we miss here? And of course, it played a role in his shaping his strategy where they talked a lot about prices and his whole campaign has been oriented around the cost of living. Interesting fact, if you look, you couldn’t have – Mandani is very different from Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill, the Democratic candidates for governor in Virginia and New Jersey we talked about earlier. All three of them are running on prices.\n\nAll three of them are running on the cost of living. And I think if in the end, as looks likely right now, that three of them all win, it’ll be a real lesson that Trump has completely lost the issue that may have been most important to electing him in the first place.\n\nSo, yeah, I basically share your view. And I think Mamdani has an interesting opportunity here. There’s another politician that I know you and I both really, really respect who was in the news a bit, and that’s Michelle Wu up in Boston. \n\nBacon: She’s the mayor of Boston. \n\nDionne: Who is a very successful progressive mayor, so successful that the guy who got into the runoff against her, Josh Kraft of the Kraft family that owns my football team, the New England Patriots, he got clobbered in the first round. He dropped out and she’s going to be unopposed in this election. And I think there is a way to be a very practical progressive mayor.\n\nAnd if you listen to what the Mamdani people are saying, they are saying, take a look at Michelle Wu if you want to know what we’re going to do. And Michelle Wu, who got over 70 percent of the vote in the first round there, is not a scary figure. She is a very competent progressive leader. And that’s, I think, what progressives need to show in cities around the country.\n\nBacon: Final thing, and this is maybe not as positive, we’ll find something positive to finish on, but I want to talk about the Kamala Harris book and discourse a little bit. I mean, let me start with the... I mean, I guess some of the things she said, I’ll be curious, what have you been remarking upon?\n\nI mean, some of the things she said I think are just... Unfortunately, sort of realities. I’m not surprised Kamala Harris, black woman, black Indian woman, did not pick gay man Buttigieg for vice president. I think she was sort of being honest about the realities. You know, Obama picked Biden for VP in part because Biden was an older white man. So, you know, and so I just I think she was acknowledging some realities there. And I’m most of what I’ve seen. I haven’t really been... She’s been a little more candid about how politics works, but I’ve not I was not I’ve not been like, you know, Shapiro is other politicians are ambitious and maybe not overly trustworthy at times, you know, news at seven. So, you know, so I’ve not been that struck by anything in a negative way. But I’ll be curious, anything struck you so far?\n\nDionne: Yeah, I’ve got the book sitting right in front of me here and I want to read the whole thing. But yeah, no, I was surprised by how candid she was on some of those things. And, you know, when you lose a race in retrospect, you say, well, maybe Pete Buttigieg would have clobbered J.D. Vance in that debate, which he probably would have. And I think she says somewhere that she wasn’t happy with Tim Walz’s performance in that debate. Which is another piece of candor you don’t expect in a book like that. You know, she went on Rachel Maddow and said, you know,\n\nit wasn’t because that’s how she felt about Pete. She admired him. You know, she admired him enormously. That was the point of what she was saying. But of course, it makes, you know, makes anybody who cares about LGBTQ rights uneasy that somebody would even say that. But it was candor. And we, you know, we always say we want politicians to be candid and then we bash them when they are. You know, in general, I guess I have this reaction and I’ve had this with Republicans. I know I’ve called Republicans who lost races and I happen to know, and I didn’t agree with them on anything, but the whole world turns on you when you lose. So I have this little instinct to be that says, you know, this woman got this nomination as she underscores in the title, 107 days before the election, are there things that you and I might look back on and say she should have done differently? Sure.\n\nI can think of things that I would have done differently if I’d been running that campaign, which I wasn’t. But, you know, it’s so easy to dump on a losing candidate. So I have this little instinct always to kind of side with a losing candidate trying to... trying to defend themselves.\n\nI think that the most interesting stuff in the book, from what I have read that’s in it again, I haven’t read the whole book yet, is how complicated the relationship was with Joe Biden in the end and with the people around Biden.\n\nAnd look, a lot of those folks are people I’ve known for years and I’m friendly with. We’re of the same generation and I respect a lot of them. But I always thought that if they made a mistake, it was that they should have known that at some point Kamala Harris was going to be really important to them, either for Biden’s reelection or in this circumstance, no one anticipated. And, you know, I think her beef that they should have done more to help her out for those three years. I think that’s a legitimate thing. to discuss in retrospect, because I think there were ways in which she could have entered that race a little stronger than she was. I think the critique of her, that she has always struggled to make clear what are her policy bottom lines. I think she lost the nomination In 2020, in part because she was really torn about whether she should run to the left or run to the middle. And I think that sometimes she conveys that uncertainty. And I think that’s something that, you know, hurt her in 2020 and may have hurt her a bit in 2024.\n\nBacon: Even her Mamdani answer was a little bit like, I support the nominee. It was sort of like... \n\nDionne: I know. I think if you’re going to do something like that, just do it.\n\nJust do it. He’s a Democratic nominee and I’m proud to support him and move on.\n\nBacon: He’s a great candidate. You don’t have to buy all of his policies on free buses or free grocery stores to say he’s a charismatic candidate. Young people love him. I support him. He’s a great figure in our party. So is Abigail Spann. There’s a way to say that that’s less kind of clenched teeth, I think. Yeah. \n\nDionne: Yeah. And, you know, it’s a way, you know, Governor Hochul, Kathy Hochul in New York sure as heck doesn’t agree with Mamdani on everything. I don’t think she’s going to sign a bill which she would have to do if he were to raise taxes in New York City on wealthy people.\n\nAnd she made clear I don’t agree with him on everything. I think she made a very shrewd call in what she did, by the way. I think it was because she is going to need the left in New York, which is substantial. It’s not a trivial group of people to support her for reelection.\n\nAnd she knows that if there are things Mamdani wants or does that are unpopular, she’s got time to distance herself between now and November. We’ll see how it plays out. And also, I think if Mamdani is going to win, It’s really better for the governor of New York and the mayor of New York if they’re in the same party to try to get along. You know, and that’s a very that’s always been one of the hardest relationships in American politics, even when the mayor and the governor of the same party. That’s a hard one. But we’ll see. I think this was smart political management on her part.\n\nAlso, I don’t think she likes Andrew Cuomo, which I expect is a personal thing there, too.\n\nBacon: Last thing, we’ve mentioned a few of them already, but I do want to finish on a, like, I think, I hear people say, you know, who do the Democrats have coming up? And without, you know, who should we be excited about? And without getting into a full 2028 who’s going to win speculation, which I think is too early for that, I want to say there’s a lot of people who I think have distinguished themselves in a positive way this year. Mamdani we’ve mentioned. Michelle Wu we’ve mentioned, the mayor of Boston who’s done a great job, I think. I interviewed Greg Casar yesterday. I thought he was very impressive, House member, progressive caucus leader, but really thinking about how do we find progressive ideas that work in purple and red areas. I think Chris Murphy of Connecticut has really done a great job from the beginning of connecting the sort of authoritarianism with the sort of like economic billionaire takeover of Musk with the sort of democracy questions that this administration brings. Chris Murphy’s been distinguished in a way I didn’t expect. \n\nGavin Newsom, who I’ll be honest, I didn’t have a very high opinion of when this started, really did on the redistricting fight and when the National Guard came, really sort of has stood up and been very strong. And like, I’m maybe to the left of him on some policy issues, but he’s been a very strong figure. \n\nI didn’t know much about J.B. Pritzker before this year, but I think if I had to vote for somebody in 2028, I’d vote for him right now. If you remember when the National Guard was thinking about coming to Chicago, he was like, hell no. organized people and really made Trump decide, do I want to fight this guy or not? And unfortunately, I don’t want the National Guard in Memphis either, but it seems very clear Trump went into Chicago and wimped out when J.B. Pritzker said, absolutely not. And that was a real moment of leadership.\n\nI’d say my governor, who’s running for president very explicitly, Andy Beshear, I like the way he’s been out there saying essentially, look, you can be in a red state you can be a moderate person but still support transgender rights and immigrant rights so you don’t we don’t have to like abandon everything we feel to be Democrats and to win because I’ve won and so I think there’s been a I think those, I named eight people there there’s been some great performances from Democrats this year I get I’ve not loved everything Hakeem or Schumer have done but I think they’re getting better. But I do want to highlight at the end that there are some Democrats who I think are, I’d say, over-performing. So I gave a long list there. So maybe you could talk to two or three of those if you agree with me or not.\n\nDionne: Yeah, no, broadly, I agree with that list. I think, you know, when you look at potential candidates the next time, I think the guys who use the summer best are Newsom and Pritzker. And I think they really gained stature with the Democratic primary electorate. And I don’t think just them by being strong this summer.\n\nAnd I agree, Bashir, Cesar, and everybody you named. So I’ll just throw out a couple more. You said earlier about the importance... My first column for The Times was about the need to make the threat, the authoritarian threat, central to American politics. \n\nAnd I argued, of course, economics is important. Of course, winning back working class voters, everybody agrees that that has to be a central task of progressives generally, not just the Democratic Party. And that’s right. But the immediate threat before us is the authoritarian reach. And I decided it’s really better to talk about the danger rather than just to defend democracy, because I believe passionately in democracy. Pat Buchanan once called me a democratist, which he makes as a negative. God bless him for saying that. I am one of those. But I think people understand better when you talk about, do you want to yank a comedian from television at the behest of the government? Do you want the Justice Department to prosecute people who are not found to have committed any crime because the president tells you to and fire prosecutors who don’t do that? \n\nBacon: I think people understand these people who are with bribes on video if they’re your friends. \n\nDionne: Right. And not to mention people who killed police officers and attacked the Capitol and all that. So let me just add a few names because I mentioned that because one of the people I quoted in my column is Jamie Raskin, who made a really great whom I think deserves to be on this on this list. who made a really great argument that, you know, the defense of democracy also means defending the material achievements of democracy. And we would not have had, you know, the National Labor Relations Act, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, civil rights laws, if we didn’t have a democracy. That democracy, you know, the Labor Party of Britain, under both its center leadership and its left leadership, has always used the phrase, we are for the many, not the few. And guess what? Democracy is good for the many. And that’s the way we have to think about it. \n\nSo Raskin is somebody I would really salute. I think Governor Cooper down in North Carolina is going to become a very interesting figure because that Senate race is really important. And, you know, I think he is sort of very much in the Andy Beshear mode as a Democrat, I think, who is very makes moderate voters feel comfortable, but is actually saying the things that are necessary and true about the dangers we face.\n\nBut your list was so good, I’m not going to try to add to it too much because I broadly agree. I could name a bunch of other people, but we’ll leave it at that. It’s interesting that if I can, we’re near the end, I know. I am really fascinated by these disapproval numbers that the Democratic Party has.\n\nAnd I think it’s going to be interesting to see what happens to those numbers if Democrats put up a real fight around the budget as we get closer to the election. And I think that the party has to show that it can actually sort of create a coherent view of the world.\n\nBut I think we also have to be realistic. These numbers are bad because Democrats are so angry that they lost the last election because of the danger that defeat created for the country. And it’s very hard to to unite around anyone when there is no formal leader of the party until the presidential process.\n\nOnly other two people I’d shout out because they are really going to be important in about a month and a half are Spanberger and Mike and Cheryl. These are two women national security Democrats, actually roommates. And I think if you have Cheryl, Mamdani and Spanberger winning on this night, you’re going to have victories for the entire, every wing of the Democratic Party.\n\nBacon: So my guess is that E.J. Dionne and Perry Bacon will think, oh, that’s good, different kinds of Democrats can win. And then I worry our factions will be like, see, Mamdani won and you can only win this way. I don’t worry. This could be a unifying thing.\n\nI wrote one of my early pieces on we need to think of ourselves as a coalition. Bill, Crystal, and Perry do not agree on maybe police funding or Israel policy, but we can agree on lots of things about authoritarianism. And I think appreciating that we can be a diverse party would be a useful thing. I don’t think people – my worry is most people want their faction to win, and that’s kind of my kind of concern all the time.\n\nDionne: As you know, I wrote a book before the 2020 election called Code Red, How Progressives and Moderates Can Unite to Save Our Country. And I think right now, both progressives and moderates or centrists or center left people, however you want to call that group, they have to realize they can’t win on their own.\n\nAnd that there is a need for a big tent. And if you look at Trump’s approval ratings, there are a lot of Americans prepared to oppose what is going on. And there’s plenty of time. I think there should be and there will be a kind of philosophical policy and intellectual debate going on alongside Trump.\n\nBut I think people have to realize the big fight now is to oppose authoritarianism and advance democracy. And that’s where a lot of people, including some Republicans, but there ain’t many of them right now. And, you know independents moderates there are a lot of people who say yeah I might not agree with you Perry or me E.J. but yeah I agree with you on this and that’s how you win in a democracy every coalitions are big and Democrats are a more diverse party in every way and they have to accept that reality \n\nBacon: You said something about the party’s poll numbers. And I was talking to Amanda Littman for one of these. She runs the group Run for Something, which I’ve been a very useful group. Her point was that we’re in this period where institutions are unpopular, whether that’s the police, the mainstream media, et cetera.\n\nAnd her point was like, maybe we should stop looking at the Democratic Party’s approval rating. Because the goal is not to elect the Democratic Party to the goal is to elect individual candidates in races like Roy Cooper is who we’re trying to elect in North Carolina or House Member X. Ultimately, Pete Buttigieg, Gavin Newsom,\n\nGretchen Whitmer people are voting for against J.D. Vance, not the Democratic Party against the Republican. And I think that’s useful to think about. But I’d be curious. I get that. Gretchen Whitmer is part of the Democratic Party, but we’re trying to elect people, not parties. We’re not a parliamentary system. We actually do elect people, not parties. And I’d be curious, is that worth thinking about?\n\nDionne: Well, I think two things about that. I think I mentioned at the beginning Steve Kornacki’s numbers where there are people who give a negative view of the party and still are voting for them against the Republicans. So I think analytically that point’s correct.\n\nI don’t think it’s a bad thing, however, for a Democratic Party to look at itself. And, you know, you can have two kinds of internal debates. You can have a debate where you tear the party apart and make it a useless form of opposition.\n\nBacon: That’s what I worry what happens often.\n\nDionne: Yeah. And Democrats are good at that. Or you can have a debate and say, you know, where have we gone wrong? What have we missed? Why is it that, you know, young voters, particularly young men are so alienated? Why did we lose so many of those Latino votes? How can we shore up support among working class voters? Why are they unhappy? And there’s a very substantive debate to be had there about, you know, economics and culture and how they interact. So I think that, you know, um, using those negative numbers as a spur to useful self-reflection and self-criticism, that’s okay. Pretending they mean what they don’t, as your interlocutor says, is not a good idea. So again, I think you can keep those two ideas in your head at the same time.\n\nBacon: Okay, that’s a great note to end on. E.J., I always love talking to you. Glad. We always have good conversations. I’m glad more people get to clue in, get to hear your insights. So hopefully you’ll join us again. And EJ, you’re writing for The Times. And what else? You’re writing a book. Can you talk about your book you’re doing? \n\nDionne: Yeah, thank you. My friend, the great historian, I thought that before he was my co-author, the great historian, Jim Kloppenberg and I taught a seminar on the crisis of social democracy. And we are writing a history of social democracy. You know, that idea that, you know, in some ways grew out of socialism, in some ways grew out of liberalism. And, you know, it was sort of dissident people who came together and said, as in Sweden and Norway and Denmark and Britain and all, and the U.S. in the New Deal era, you know, came together and said, we’re not going to blow up the market, but we don’t want the market should not be the sole determinant of our values or people’s opportunities in life. And this is a noble movement going back to the 19th century. And we’re writing about a history of it with eyes wide open about the challenges it is facing in all over the world. \n\nAlthough I noted this recently in another podcast, you know, the social Democrats did just win an election in Norway. So maybe as Norway goes, so goes the world. I don’t think so, but I like to say that. And, but, you know, it’s about the challenges facing this movement, but it’s, it’s been a really complicated thing to write. Because we’re talking about 130 years and potentially 25, 30 countries and more than that. But we’re almost there. So it’s I think it is important, at least something I enjoy doing, but I also think it’s important that we never look at our own country’s politics in a vacuum. There are a lot of people around the world experiencing some of the same issues and problems. And you’re certainly seeing that in politics across the democracies right now.\n\nBacon: And on that point, thanks for joining me, E.J. Great to see you. \n\nDionne: Thank you. Take care.","summary":"The following is a lightly edited transcript of the September 24 episode of\nRight Now With Perry Bacon.

I'm going to tone it down. I will. You're going to see.\"\n\nHowever, Trump's post didn't seem to address Harris' allegation of him being a 'con man', and instead focused on her appearance on the talk show.\n\nTrump shared his response on his social media platform Truth Social, writing a capital-studded rant in his typically restrained and tasteful style, which was directed at the former Vice President.\n\nThis was her claim that the 2024 election was close, an assertion that Trump took extreme issue with, even going so far as to call Harris 'dumb as a rock'.\n\nTaking to Truth Social, Trump posted: \"Kamala Harris, who is DUMB AS A ROCK, is going around and using, as a standard part of her Speech on why she lost the Election, that 2024 was the “closest Presidential Election in the 21st Century.” Everyone knows this is a lie, and was covered as such by Fox News!\"\n\nHe continued: \"I won the Electoral College, 312-226, a LANDSLIDE, Counties Nationwide, 2,600 to 525, a LANDSLIDE, all seven Swing States, a LANDSLIDE, and, despite the fact that California’s Fake Mail In Ballots came in at ridiculous numbers (It was RIGGED!), I still won the Popular Vote by MILLIONS! Bush, as an example, won the Election by 537 Votes, and many other Elections were very close.\"\n\nThe president went on to say that he is now expecting an apology, writing: \"Kamala’s 'closest in the 21st Century' soundbite was, like everything else in the Democrat Party, A TOTAL LIE! I expect an apology. Thank you for your attention to this matter!\"\n\nWhile Trump did win all the swing states and secure their electoral college votes, the margins in many of them were thin.\n\nThe states that Trump managed to flip were all on thin margins, with Michigan saw Trump win by just 1.4 per cent, Wisconsin was 0.9 per cent, and Georgia a difference of 2.2 per cent.\n\nIt was enough to secure a comfortable victory for Trump in the electoral college, but the margins in the swing states paint a picture more akin to a photo finish rather than the resounding landslide that Trump's allies trumpeted.","summary":"![CDATA[Trump responded furiously to Harris' claims]]","url":"https://www.unilad.com/news/us-news/donald-trump-kamala-harris-truth-social-row-469219-20250925","image":"https://images.ladbible.com/resize?type=webp&quality=70&width=1200&fit=contain&gravity=auto&url=https://images.ladbiblegroup.com/v3/assets/blt949ea8e16e463049/bltc631b43d37d60873/68d554464e35da0a52993616/trump-scathing-message-kamala-harris-leaked-convers","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-25 15:21:06","author":"Kit Roberts","authors":["Kit Roberts"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.185},{"id":363435910,"title":"Take A Listen To Kamala’s Audiobook, Slowed Down","text":"Kamala Harris’ dishy new book, “107 Days,” is making political headlines for how her team, one year out from President Joe Biden’s decision to drop out of the race, was already hatching a transition plan. It also includes her reasoning behind picking Tim Walz as her running mate.\n\nBut, perhaps most notably, the book is also ticking off some Democrats, with one anonymous adviser to a potential 2028 Democratic candidate telling Politico that Harris “chose to write a gossip book that prioritizes the pettiness of her politics.” (RELATED: Kamala’s Memoir Is So Bad, It’s Hard To Believe She Read It)\n\n“At a time when people are looking for a vision and leadership … and want to see leaders rise to the level of threat facing the country, it’s pretty crazy she chose to write a gossip book that prioritizes the pettiness of her politics,” the adviser said. “It’s embarrassing for her, and for all Democrats, considering she was the leader of the party less than a year ago.”\n\nOn a much lighter note, however, on Tuesday, a talk radio show out of Philadelphia brilliantly played a snippet of Harris’ book, albeit slowed down. The result was hilarious, and it certainly sounded as if Harris were drunk. The way her words get draaaaaaaaawn out is usually a tell-tale sign of inebriation.\n\n Are we sure Kamala Harris wasn’t drinking while recording her new audiobook?🍹🍷🍸 HILARIOUS! @stuntbrain was ON FIRE on today’s Kayal and Co!🔥🔥 @NickKayal @DawnStensland @MattRooneyNJ @GREGSTOCKER @AlmquistOnAir pic.twitter.com/dIijccL9ZK — Talk Radio 1210 WPHT (@1210WPHT) September 23, 2025\n\nBack in July, Harris posted a TikTok in which she claimed she had not been slinging adult beverages during her absence from the public eye.\n\n“Everyone thinks you’ve been kicking back, drinking margaritas on the beach, but really you’ve been hard at work writing a book, meeting with leaders, thinking about the future of our country,” Harris said, a reference to a dorky TikTok trend at that time in which participants turn their heads away from the camera, concealing their mouths while delivering audacious statements.\n\n“Who said that?” she jokingly asked.\n\nOf course, she probably wasn’t drunk during the recording; however, it wouldn’t shock me if she was. I also wouldn’t blame her.

His faith in human over synthetic creativity may hold some truth in the literary space. But on our screens – from film, art and satire to the algorithmically turbo-charged, factually opaque, monetised churn of the 24/7 news cycle – AI is already making us laugh.\n\nDeepfakes – synthetic audio and video of people doing and saying things they never said or did – are the chief comedic disruptors in a suite of increasingly persuasive AI tools shaping the post-truth reality envisioned by the Microsoft engineer Eric Horvitz, where fact and fiction are indistinguishable. In eight short years, deepfakes have risen from cultural outlier to mainstream meme, embodying the futurist Roy Amara’s Law: we overestimate the effects of new technology in the short run, but underestimate its long-term impacts.\n\nAnd with some experts predicting 90% of online content could be AI-generated by 2027, the extent to which synthetic replicas will change how we trust and interact with on-screen depictions of real people is now an urgent question for creators, policymakers and viewers.\n\nWhen deepfakes emerged in 2017 as incel-produced nonconsensual porn, the alarm they generated was justified. But as soon as deepfakes started being used a political tool, concerns snowballed into panic. Philosophers labelled them an “epistemic threat” to evidentiary systems; corporations mounted costly (and unsuccessful) detection programs; and pundits warned of an “info-apocalypse”, in which a convincing deepfake of a world leader could start world war three. Less dramatic but equally chilling was the prediction that the mere awareness of deepfakes would collapse civic trust altogether. In 2018 Jordan Peele made a prophetic deepfake of Obama urging viewers to rely on credible news sources, lest we become a “fucked up dystopia”.\n\nCut to 2025, and satirical deepfakes are part of the news cycle. Shortly after attending Pope Francis’ funeral, US president Donald Trump posted a viral deepfake of himself in papal regalia. In response to Doge cuts to public services, a deepfake of Trump fellating Elon Musk’s foot appeared on a DC government lobby screen. Following Trump’s declaration he would transform Gaza into a Middle Eastern “Riviera”, a satirical deepfake appeared on Instagram, showing Trump sipping cocktails with Israel prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu in an AI-slop fantasy of Gaza as a beachside resort, full of gold Trump statues and happy Palestinian children. And just last month, South Park’s deepfake of Trump with a micro-penis elicited an official rebuke from the White House.\n\nDeepfakes in fact have been disrupting democratic processes since 2018, when Indian nationalists circulated a deepfake porn video of the journalist Rana Ayyub, in an attempt to silence her. But the elevation of deepfake satire as a weapon in mainstream politics is a more recent trend. During the 2024 US election campaign, Trump posted absurdist deepfakes of Kamala Harris addressing a communist rally and admitting she was a DEI hire. A surreal Republican attack ad showed a deepfake Joe Biden winning the presidency and its AI-imagined consequences: war with Taiwan, bank closures and US cities destroyed by crime. Echoing warnings that the rise of deepfakes could be used to discredit authentic recordings, Trump falsely accused Harris of deepfaking her crowd sizes.\n\nAnd AI “slopaganda” is coming for Trump too. Viral platforms Make AI Great Again and Global Presidents are generating billions of views for videos featuring a panoply of strongmen – from Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy to Kim Jong-un – emasculating Trump in slapstick pranks. (That Chinese leader Xi Jinping is largely absent from these clips has prompted speculation about their origins and goals.)\n\nIn stark contrast to this perniciously populist deepfakery, progressive artists and activists are using AI counterfeits to provoke, astonish and speak truth to power. Stephanie Lepp’s Deepfake Reckonings imagines a “morally courageous” US justice Brett Kavanaugh; and Kendrick Lamar’s The Heart music video deepfakes him as OJ Simpson and Kobe Bryant, to destabilise assumptions about black identity. Compil des Bleues inserts the faces of France’s soccer stars on to the bodies of its female World Cup team, to highlight the women’s equal athleticism; while the Lincoln Project’s posthumous deepfake of Trump’s father Fred labels his son “a fuck up”, “trash” and “a disgrace”; declaring “I’ve been dead for 30 years and I’m still ashamed of you.”\n\nProfessional film-makers are also manipulating deepfakes to play with the truth. Black Mirror’s Joan is Awful depicts a matryoshka-like dystopia where characters are deepfakes of deepfakes; Sassy Justice by the South Park creators portrays Trump as a corruption-slaying TV journalist; and the Polish biopic Putin delivers an unflinching AI portrait of its titular hero. The documentary Welcome to Chechnya deploys deepfake masks to protect its persecuted gay subjects; while A Life Uncharted uses real audio of its deceased protagonist, Thunderbirds creator Gerry Anderson, to construct a candid deepfake interview.\n\nDeepfakes come with very real risks that demand urgent regulation: cybercrime, corporate fraud, intimate image-abuse and political disinformation among them. But it is vital that AI’s escalating persuasive power is regulated without stifling creativity and innovation.\n\nOn this, at least, film-makers and big tech are aligned. When xAI unveiled its new Grok AI tool, German satirists used it to make a deepfake of Elon Musk committing an armed robbery – and thanked him for supporting free speech.\n\n Dr Anna Broinowski is a film-maker, author and synthetic media researcher at Sydney University. She will be speaking on a panel about AI at Curious festival, held at Sydney Opera House on Sunday 28 September","summary":"Deepfakes come with risks that demand urgent regulation.

The book was released earlier this week surrounded in controversy as the former vice president offers new criticisms of Joe Biden and his White House.\n\nWhile speaking to a crowd of 1,500 in Midtown Manhattan, Harris distanced herself from the Biden administration by noting she would have handled the Israel-Hamas war differently than her former boss.\n\nApproximately 20 minutes after the event began, a protester started screaming over Harris by accusing the former vice president of supporting genocide, according to the Washington Post.\n\n‘The blood of the Palestinians is on your hands,’ one male protester shouted at Harris.\n\nThe crowd of supporters drowned out the protester by shouting over him. Harris then began discussing her position on Gaza in her book before another demonstrator interrupted her remarks.\n\n‘You’re not letting me talk! I respect your right to talk, but you’re not letting me speak!’ she told the protester.\n\n‘Let’s bring the temperature down,’ Harris added. ‘Unlike the current president of the United, I understand what’s happening right now in Gaza, what is happening to the Palestinian people is outrageous and it breaks my heart. I get it.’\n\nAs the chaos continued within the crowd, Harris shouted back: ‘I’m not president right now. There’s nothing I can do!’\n\nThroughout the 2024 election, the Democratic party remained divided over Biden’s policy on Israel amid the war in Gaza.\n\nHarris tried to defend her history regarding Israel by claiming she rebuffed the country for their treatment of Palestinian civilians in Gaza five months after the October 7th attack.\n\n‘I was the first person at the highest level of our United States government or administration to talk about the fact that the people in Gaza were starving,’ she said. ‘I took a lot of heat from the administration for doing that.’\n\n‘There are a lot of people that did not like that I spoke out so forcefully and candidly about my concern about what was happening in Gaza.’\n\nHarris also slammed the Trump administration’s handling of the war in Gaza. She said Trump is allowing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to do whatever he wants despite civilian deaths.\n\n‘Donald Trump has given Netanyahu a blank check to do whatever he wants,’ she noted. ‘Anybody see that spectacle of the UN yesterday?’\n\nAt that point a third protester interrupted Harris by stating the crisis in the Middle was the ‘fault’ of the former vice president, according to the Hollywood Reporter.\n\n‘I understand the pain that that person just expressed,” Harris replied. ‘I understand what this moment is it, whether it be what’s happening in Gaza or just so many things right now that are absolutely unconscionable and so painful to know could happen and that our president and our government is standing by and allowing people like [Vladimir] Putin and Kim Jong Un and Xi [Jinping] to get away with whatever.’\n\n‘They’re laughing at us right now. They’re laughing at us. And so I get it, but I would like to continue with the conversation,' she said.\n\nWhile speaking on the campaign tail back in 2024, Harris regularly faced protesters at campaign rallies who accused the Biden administration of supporting ‘genocide’ in Gaza.","summary":"Approximately 20 minutes after the event began, a protester started screaming over Harris by accusing the former vice president of supporting genocide.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15133099/Kamala-Harris-Palestinian-protesters-book.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/09/25/13/102444867-0-image-m-18_1758804844870.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-25 14:58:41","author":"Editor,Phillip Nieto","authors":["Editor","Phillip Nieto"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.529},{"id":363410932,"title":"Jimmy Kimmel Gets Back to Normal on Late Night, Tearing Trump a New One","text":"Skip to main content\n\nSeptember 25, 2025 7:40am\n\nShare on Facebook\n\nShare to Flipboard\n\nSend an Email\n\nShow additional share options\n\nShare on LinkedIn\n\nShare on Pinterest\n\nShare on Reddit\n\nShare on Tumblr\n\nShare on Whats App\n\nPrint the Article\n\nPost a Comment\n\n'Jimmy Kimmel Live!'\n\nRandy Holmes/Disney\n\nShare on Facebook\n\nShare to Flipboard\n\nSend an Email\n\nShow additional share options\n\nShare on LinkedIn\n\nShare on Pinterest\n\nShare on Reddit\n\nShare on Tumblr\n\nShare on Whats App\n\nPrint the Article\n\nPost a Comment\n\nOur long national late night-mare has ended, and Jimmy Kimmel Live! is back on the airwaves — well, in most of the country. Can we all get back to normal now, please? On Wednesday, one week after his show was first suspended, Jimmy Kimmel did, more or less.\n\nIn his second show back, Kimmel got a rousing ovation and a “Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy!” chant a la The Jerry Springer Show. Kimmel opened with a few preemption jokes and another about fellow ABC program The Golden Bachelor. And then he settled right back in to his old schtick: mocking President Trump.\n\nRelated Stories\n\nKamala Harris' First Book Tour Appearance Disrupted by Gaza Protesters\n\nDisney Hit With Legal Salvo From Shareholders Over Jimmy Kimmel Suspension\n\nKimmel is especially adept at that, not that it’s an especially tough task when Trump is active on social media, as he has been since Kimmel’s suspension and reinstatement.\n\n“I can’t believe ABC Fake News gave Jimmy Kimmel his job back. The White House was told by ABC that his Show was cancelled! Something happened between then and now because his audience is GONE, and his ‘talent’ was never there,” Trump posted to his Truth Social platform. “Why would they want someone back who does so poorly, who’s not funny, and who puts the Network in jeopardy by playing 99% positive Democrat GARBAGE. He is yet another arm of the DNC and, to the best of my knowledge, that would be a major Illegal Campaign Contribution. I think we’re going to test ABC out on this. Let’s see how we do. Last time I went after them, they gave me $16 Million Dollars. This one sounds even more lucrative.”\n\n“Only Donald Trump would try to prove that he’s not threatening ABC by threatening ABC,” Kimmel quipped.\n\n“A true bunch of losers!” Trump’s post concluded. “Let Jimmy Kimmel rot in his bad Ratings.”\n\nWell, Kimmel certainly did not have bad ratings in his Tuesday return. Even with nearly a quarter of the country blacked out due to affiliate preemptions — protests and temper tantrums by station groups and owners, basically — Jimmy Kimmel Live! had its largest-ever audience for a regular episode in the show’s 22-year history.\n\n“He does know bad ratings,” Kimmel acknowledged of Trump, accompanied by a chyron of the president’s poor approval ratings.\n\nLater in the Wednesday monologue, before Ethan Hawke so rudely interrupted things, Kimmel helped Fox News Channel’s Jesse Watters investigate escalator-gate, our latest controversy in which somebody appears to have stopped a working escalator inside of the UN building just as first lady Melania Trump and the POTUS board the moving stairway. Fortunately, tragedy — in this case, maybe a stubbed toe or awkward-looking step — was averted.\n\nOK, so maybe our long national nightmare is just getting started.\n\nKimmel was benched a week ago after a monologue joke made reference to MAGA Republicans scrambling to distance their politics from the ideologies of conservative pundit Charlie Kirk’s alleged shooter, Tyler Robinson. The remarks were interpreted by many on the right as an incorrect classification of Robinson’s beliefs and a direct or indirect placement of blame for Kirk’s murder on extreme-right politics. Sponsors and some station owners retaliated after Trump and his FCC chair Brendan Carr made their feelings about the matter known, and Disney/ABC shut the late-night show down — temporarily, it turns out — amid the mounting pressure.\n\nSupport for Kimmel (and for free speech) brought the show back in short time.\n\nTHR Newsletters\n\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\n\nLouis Partridge\n\n‘House of Guinness’ Review: Netflix’s 19th-Century Family Saga Serves Frothy Fun and Not Much Substance\n\n‘Alice in Borderland’ Stars on Dealing With Trauma in Season 3 of Netflix’s Japanese Survival Drama\n\nTrey Parker\n\n‘South Park’ Mocks Social Gambling, Israel-Gaza Conflict and FCC Chair Brendan Carr\n\n‘Big Mouth’ Producer Hannah Myers on Working Through the Rise of Adult Animation\n\n‘The Morning Show’ Women Are “Nakedly Ambitious” in Season 4: “It’s Fun to Hear Them Say the Quiet Thing Out Loud”\n\n‘Jimmy Kimmel Live!’ Draws Record Ratings in Return from Suspension\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter is a part of Penske Media Corporation. © 2025 The Hollywood Reporter, LLC.

Santiago/Getty Images\n\nWhile the United States is mired in one Donald Trump controversy after another, much of the rest of the industrialized world is steadily moving into the future. Other nations can’t ignore America, but they can try to figure out new ways to proceed with less American involvement, and many of them are doing just that. China, in particular, is taking advantage of this situation, and that’s especially true when it comes to renewable energy.\n\nChina has been leading the world in the production of renewable energy components for years, and it will only become more dominant in the sector as the United States withdraws from it. More than just withdrawing from what other countries see as the future of energy, the Trump administration is reportedly telling our European allies that climate change is “overhyped,” and to stop worrying about it so much and join the administration’s fossil fuel agenda.\n\n“It’s going to have exactly the opposite effect,” David Victor, a distinguished professor of innovation and public policy at the University of California, San Diego, tells Rolling Stone. “Trump. 2.0 is like Trump 1.0 in the sense that they do things and then the reaction from the rest of the world is to do the opposite.”\n\nAt the United Nations on Tuesday, Trump went on a bizarre rant about climate change and renewable energy, which he loves to attack whenever he can. The president railed against wind power, called the idea of a carbon footprint a “hoax,” and told diplomats from around the world: “If you don’t get away from this green scam, your country is going to fail.”\n\nAs for China, the country is continuing to produce massive amounts of components for solar energy, wind energy, and battery storage. It’s also producing a huge number of affordable, trendy electric vehicles. China has invested more than $625 billion in clean energy last year, and the country has been investing hundreds of billions into its EV industry. \n\n“They have so much capacity that they’re exporting products at really low prices,” says David Hart, a senior fellow for climate and energy at the Council on Foreign Relations. “This is causing many other countries to adopt, especially solar, really quickly.”\n\nEditor’s picks\n\nThe 250 Greatest Albums of the 21st Century So Far\n\nThe 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time\n\nThe 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\n\n100 Best Movies of the 21st Century\n\nThanks to the fact China’s government under President Xi Jinping has near total control over the country’s economy, it can basically move in whatever direction he wants it to, and he’s betting big on the future of renewable energy. He has made it clear he wants China to dominate in this space for years to come. \n\n“That’s the thing about authoritarian governments. If they decide to do something and they really put their mind to it, they can turn much quicker than less authoritarian governments are used to,” says Catherine Wolfram, a professor of energy and applied economics at MIT. “China has pretty clearly decided that that’s where the world is going and has invested heavily in electric vehicles.”\n\nThe Chinese car company BYD has been getting a lot of attention lately, because it’s producing attractive EVs and hybrids that are affordable, dependable, and stylish. The company has over twice the global market share of Tesla, and it is quickly gaining traction in Europe — but it likely won’t be selling cars in the U.S. anytime soon.\n\n“They are aggressive competitors, especially for lower cost vehicles. It’s incredible what they’ve done,” Victor says. “Europe and America have had two very different strategies. The European strategy has been to allow them in, but to kind of keep an eye on it, and then boom, they’ve come. … The U.S. strategy has been that almost no Chinese EVs are sold in the United States.”\n\nRelated Content\n\nJimmy Kimmel Responds to Trump’s Threats: ‘An Old-Fashioned Eighties Movie-Style Bully’\n\nMigrant Detainees Shot in Attack at Dallas ICE Facility\n\nTrump and RFK Jr.’s Autism Fixation Is Becoming a Public-Health Risk\n\nGavin Newsom Says His Social Media Strategy Reveals ‘the Absurdity of Donald Trump’\n\nChina’s success can be seen as good news if you care about the world transitioning to clean energy. It’s not such good news if you care about the U.S. remaining economically competitive on the world stage in the future. While other industrialized nations are making progress in building the markets of the future, the U.S. is slowing its pace and forcing reliance on antiquated fossil fuel technology. \n\n“If we slow down, we’re not walking away from renewables. The fundamentals are still there,” Victor says. “The overall effect of it is we’re going to just deploy fewer renewables.” \n\nThe U.S. isn’t completely giving up on clean energy. It’s integrated into the economy, and many American clean energy companies are doing well. However, at a time when the renewable energy sector is moving quickly and large sums of money are being invested, the U.S. is essentially ceding the space to other world powers. While China is investing billions, the Trump administration is withdrawing billions of dollars of federal funding from renewable energy projects around the country.\n\nIf the U.S. decides to shift gears in the not-too-distant future and wants to increase its share of the renewable energy market, it may want to cooperate with China to some degree, rather than just trying to beat it. Wolfram says she thinks that could actually become a beneficial relationship.\n\nTrending Stories\n\nNate Bargatze Says He Didn’t Plan on Donating His Own Money for Failed Emmys Bit\n\nDarius Rucker's New Supergroup With Members of R.E.M., Black Crowes Announce Tour\n\nEmma Watson Says Conversation With J.K.

The U.S. is really good at innovating. We can work together.”\n\nWhether that ends up being the right move, the Trump administration is clearly putting the country in a position where it will have to play catch up in the future. Furthermore, considering the U.S. is one of the largest climate polluters in the world, it’s actively making the fight against climate change substantially more difficult for the rest of the world. Trump reminded everyone in his address at the UN on Tuesday that as long as he’s in charge, the U.S. will remain a disruptive force. \n\nNewsrooms Can Learn From Bill McKibben’s Climate Journalism\n\nMark Hertsgaard and Kyle Pope\n\nMigrant Detainees Shot in Attack at Dallas ICE Facility\n\nDallas Shooting\n\nNikki McCann Ramirez\n\nTrump and RFK Jr.’s Autism Fixation Is Becoming a Public-Health Risk\n\n‘Demoralizing’\n\nNikki McCann Ramirez\n\nKamala Harris Acknowledges Campaign Mistakes, Slams Trump’s ‘Fragile Ego’ on ‘The View’\n\nLooking Back\n\nLarisha Paul\n\nEducator, ACLU Sue University After Firing Linked to Kirk Criticism\n\nNot So Fast\n\nTim Dickinson\n\nGo to PMC.com\n\nMost Popular\n\nJimmy Kimmel and Disney Working to Reach Compromise to Bring His Show Back\n\nEx-Disney CEO Michael Eisner Weighs in on Jimmy Kimmel Suspension: \"Where Has All the Leadership Gone?\"\n\nJamie Lee Curtis’ Post About Jimmy Kimmel’s Suspension Is as Subtle as It Is Chilling\n\nStatue of Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein Holding Hands Mysteriously Appears in D.C.\n\nYou might also like\n\nTaylor Swift to Appear on ‘The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon’\n\n2 hours ago\n\nPrince William & Kate Middleton's Royal Reset Marks the End of 'Unhappy Memories'\n\n4 hours ago\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Nilufar Fetes 10 Years, Nina Yashar Poises In-house Design Collection for Growth\n\n15 minutes ago\n\nIf AI Was Really Used to Censor ‘Together’ in China, It Represents a Potentially Terrifying Future\n\nESPN, NFL Try to Sack Gastineau’s $100M ’30-for-30′ Lawsuit\n\n58 minutes ago\n\nRolling Stone is a part of Penske Media Corporation. © 2025 Rolling Stone, LLC.

The incumbent Democrat defeated far-right MAGA Republican Doug Mastriano by roughly 15 percent in 2022, and some Democratic strategists are hoping he will run for president in 2028 — arguing that he is moderate enough to go the distance not only in Pennsylvania, but also, in other swing states such as Arizona, Georgia, Michigan and Wisconsin. \n\nBut Republicans in the Keystone State are feeling bullish about Pennsylvania State Treasurer Stacy Garrity, who is seeking her state's 2026 GOP gubernatorial nomination. And according to Philadelphia Inquirer reporters Gillian McGoldrick and Katie Bernard, Garrity's latest \"unprecedented\" move may be carefully designed to improve her chances should she become the nominee and go up against Shapiro in the general election.\n\nIn an article published by the Inquirer on September 24, McGoldrick and Bernard report, \"Pennsylvania Treasurer Stacy Garrity stepped in on Wednesday to offer counties and early education programs $500 million in low-interest loans to hold them over until a final state budget deal is complete, sidestepping the General Assembly and Gov. Josh Shapiro as they near the start of a third month at an impasse. Garrity, a Republican who last month announced her bid to challenge Shapiro in next year's gubernatorial election, announced the unprecedented move to allow the (Pennsylvania) State Treasury to offer the loans to county human service departments for the many social services they provide, as well as for early education Head Start programs, at a 4.5 percent interest rate.\"\n\nThe reporters adds, \"Counties, schools, and social service providers have pleaded for months with the legislature to finalize a budget so they can begin receiving their expected state payments, which have been on hold since the beginning of the fiscal year on July 1…. The move would allow counties to access millions of dollars for early education programs serving 35,000 children across the state, as well as for county social services — all of which have been operating for months without their state appropriation, with no end to the budget impasse in sight.\"\n\nShapiro's Democratic allies tout him as a problem-solver who can cut through partisan politics and get things done in a volatile swing state that went to ex-President Joe Biden in 2020 and Donald Trump in 2024. And he was on Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris' short list for a running mate last year, although she ultimately chose Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. \n\nBut Garrity's allies, according to McGoldrick and Bernard, are hoping to convince voters that she is the real problem-solver in the race.\n\nGarrity denies that her move has anything to do with running for governor, but Pennsylvania State Senate President Pro Tempore was quick to praise her — saying, in a statement, \"Today, Treasurer Stacy Garrity made a bold move that shows what 'get stuff done' actually looks like. Treasurer Garrity's leadership is on display as her solution-driven option is exactly what we need, but has been glaringly missing from the present administration.\"\n\nMcGoldrick and Bernard explain, \"Garrity's decision to act unilaterally without the action of the (Pennsylvania) General Assembly allows her to capitalize politically on the ongoing budget crisis over Shapiro, challenging his image as a moderate Democratic governor of a politically 'purple' state willing to work across the aisle in a divided legislature. That brand, which he has built nationally as he is rumored to have interest in running for president in 2028, has been tested as he has so far been unable to secure a budget deal or a recurring funding stream for the state's beleaguered mass transit agencies, including SEPTA. Shapiro, for his part, has described his role in budget negotiations as being a go-between for Senate Republicans and House Democrats, who control their respective chambers, and has said that the two caucuses remain 'diametrically opposed' on some issues.\"\n\nRead the full Philadelphia Inquirer article at this link (subscription required).","summary":"Pennsylvania Republicans know that incumbent Democratic Gov.

In 1835, when Harriet Jacobs tried to carve out dignity from the hell of enslavement, her owner stalked her for years because he was determined to possess and break her. When Celia, a 19-year-old enslaved girl in Missouri, finally resisted her master’s rapes and killed him in 1855, the law itself chased her down, tried and hanged her to prove that the system would sooner destroy a Black woman than admit her right to defend her own body. And when Margaret Garner ran across the frozen Ohio River in 1856, her white master was right behind her, desperate to drag her back into bondage. The history of this country is haunted by white men hunting down Black women because their flight, their freedom, and their refusal to bow threatened the whole architecture of white power. And now, here we are again. Donald Trump, a racist convicted felon, has made Lisa Cook his obsession. She is a Governor of the Federal Reserve Board, the first Black woman ever appointed to that role, a position no white man in history has ever had to defend so fiercely just to exist in. Trump tried to fire her. The courts told him no. He tried again. They told him no again. Twice defeated, Trump escalated. And now, like a slavemaster who cannot abide the idea of a Black woman out of his grip, he has dragged her case all the way to the Supreme Court, demanding Cook’s immediate removal. Because he cannot — he will not — let the rulings stand. He cannot allow a powerful Black woman to defy him, to survive him, or outlast his fury. Like the slavemasters before him, Trump cannot sleep while the “runaway negress” remains beyond his grasp. Why is he so fixated? Because Lisa Cook embodies the one thing Trump cannot control: legitimacy. She has the credentials, the expertise, the history-making role. She is a Black woman sitting in one of the most powerful positions in global finance and is entrusted with decisions that move markets and shape economies. Her presence alone dismantles his myth that only white men like him can govern. Her survival after his assaults would prove that Black women cannot be so easily erased. And for Trump, that is a wound his ego cannot survive. But why her? Why Lisa Cook and nobody else on the Board? Trump has fumed about Jerome Powell for years, threatened to demote him, even mused about firing him outright. But he never dragged Powell into court. He never filed emergency appeals to erase him. Because Trump does not chase competence when it comes in a white suit and tie. He chases it when it comes wrapped in Black womanhood. Every other governor represents continuity, but Cook represents rupture and the breaking of a ceiling that white men have guarded for over a century. She is history standing in his face. She is proof that the Fed’s power does not belong exclusively to men like him. That’s why she is the target. That’s why he cannot let her stand. Trump’s war on Cook is not about mortgage forms. This is about power. It is about whether a president can bend independent institutions to his will. The Federal Reserve was designed to be insulated from political interference, precisely so that decisions about inflation, interest rates, and monetary policy could not be weaponized for partisan gain. If Trump can remove Cook for allegations that predate her tenure, then every Fed governor is vulnerable. Independence collapses. Markets lose faith. Policy becomes hostage to presidential tantrums. But Cook has not been Trump’s only target. Since clawing back the presidency in January, Trump has waged a systematic campaign against Black women in public power. He fired Carla Hayden, the first Black woman Librarian of Congress, and the first librarian ever to hold the role, by email. Because the Library of Congress is the nation’s memory, he could not tolerate a Black woman guarding the nation’s knowledge, curating its memory, shaping what history gets preserved. Better to purge her than endure the sight of her authority. He tried to oust Gwynne Wilcox, the first Black woman on the National Labor Relations Board, in a move so flagrantly unlawful that a judge ordered her reinstated. For a moment, the courts forced Trump to back down. But like Lisa Cook, Wilcox has been caught in his endless appeals with her reinstatement stayed, her seat in limbo, her work stalled. Wilcox represents labor, the workers who make the economy run. And Trump made clear that when a Black woman sits in that chair, her presence itself is intolerable. As it stands now, the Supreme Court has frozen her reinstatement, leaving Wilcox off the Board while the legal battle drags on. He stripped former vice president Kamala Harris of her Secret Service detail. He ended the protection Joe Biden had extended, leaving her exposed as she steps out on a national book tour. In a country where political violence is not an abstraction but a daily threat, Trump deliberately made her vulnerable. That was a signal to his base that even a former vice president could be put in danger if she is a Black woman who defied him. Even at the local level, the smear campaigns follow. Newark City Council President LaMonica McIver’s indictment for assault against immigration officers in June didn’t happen in a vacuum; it came straight out of Trump’s Justice Department. She is the first sitting member of Congress criminally charged under his new term, and the target was no accident. McIver is a Black woman wielding oversight power at the very site of Trump’s immigration crackdown, and for that, she was criminalized. Check the hypocrisy: Trump pardoned white Jan. 6 rioters who stormed the Capitol and assaulted officers, yet his DOJ is dragging McIver into court for allegedly “impeding” federal agents during an oversight visit. Then the media chorus chimed in, with Politico dismissing her indictment as a “flop,” trivializing her struggle and feeding Trump’s larger narrative that Black women in power are illegitimate. So insurrectionists get to walk free, but a Black woman doing her job is treated like a criminal. Piece all these attacks together, and you can see the blueprint. Hayden represents knowledge. Wilcox represents labor. Cook represents money. Harris represents security. McIver represents politics. One by one, Trump has gone after every pillar of American life that a Black woman dared to hold. This is a racialized purge. And the hypocrisy couldn’t be any louder. Trump is a convicted felon, found guilty on 34 counts of falsifying business records. His empire is built on fraud, bankruptcy, and deceit. And yet he dares to call Lisa Cook dishonest, paint Carla Hayden as unfit, treat Gwynne Wilcox as expendable, and end Kamala Harris’s protection as if her life is not worth guarding. His corruption is permanent, but theirs is invented. His sins are excused, but their competence is criminalized. The chase is the point. Just as Jacobs, Celia, and Garner were hunted in their time, Trump is hunting now. The slave master has been replaced by a racist president, the hounds by court filings, the auction block by political headlines. But the logic is identical: when a Black woman runs, resists, or simply stands her ground, the whole machinery of white power mobilizes to drag her down. Lisa Cook’s case is the sharpest edge of that blade. If Trump succeeds at the Supreme Court, the precedent will be devastating. The Federal Reserve will no longer be independent. Presidents will be able to purge governors for any reason, real or imagined. Every dissenting voice can be silenced. And the symbolic message will be even worse: if Lisa Cook can be erased, no Black woman in power is safe. If she prevails, the meaning is just as powerful. It will prove that the law still places limits on presidential vengeance. It will prove that a Black woman can fight back and win. It will prove that independence is stronger than rage. That is why Trump cannot let Lisa Cook win. Because her survival would expose the weakness of his authoritarian grip and shatter the centuries of epigenetic inheritance that told white men they could always chase, catch, and crush Black women with impunity. The courts told him no. Twice. Now all eyes turn to the Supreme Court to see if they will finally slam the door on his obsession. But here’s the truth: whether Lisa Cook stays or goes, the pattern is undeniable. Trump has declared war on Black women in every arena of American life — knowledge, labor, money, politics, even safety itself. And that war is not new. It is the oldest story in this country: white men chasing, hunting, punishing Black women for daring to stand free. Every lash, every chain, every courtroom ambush has been about protecting the lie at the center of white supremacy. The lie is that white men are the only ones born to rule, and everyone else exists to serve, obey, or be destroyed. Lisa Cook is not just fighting for her seat on the Fed. She is standing in a river of history, and every “no” to Trump is a “yes” to the generations of Black women who refused to bow.

It was very difficult. I know many people experienced it in different ways.\"\n\nAs for actually thinking about election night all over again, Harris confessed that she and her husband had not discussed election night until she was writing the book.\n\n\"That chapter of the book was probably one of the most difficult things that I had to reflect on and write about,\" she said.\n\n\"It wasn't until I was writing that chapter that we ever talked about election night.

Of those opposed, 25% were a definite no vote, 8% said no, but they might change their mind and another 3% leaned toward a no vote. The poll’s margin of error is 4%.\n\nJen Loving, the CEO of Destination: Home — the nonprofit that funded the poll — said they wanted to make sure the community was “looking at options for protecting the health care of the most vulnerable people.”\n\nThe “Big, Beautiful Bill,” which Trump signed into law on July 4, calls for $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid over the next decade and instills new work requirements that could kick 5.3 million people off the federally-funded health insurance program, according to estimates from the Congressional Budget Office. In Santa Clara County, one in four residents rely on Medicaid — called Medi-Cal in California — and 50% of the Santa Clara Valley Healthcare system’s revenue comes from Medicaid reimbursements.\n\n“Behavioral health and physical health care is an integral part of our work in terms of protecting people who are homeless and on the streets,” Loving said. “The loss of that was a deep concern to us. We wanted to see if there was something that we could do to mitigate that.”\n\nCounty officials estimate that the recent federal cuts will lead to a roughly $1 billion annual funding gap in the budget in the coming years. The proposed sales tax increase is expected to generate approximately $330 million annually.\n\nCounty Executive James Williams told The Mercury News that while the county didn’t fund the poll, they provided input on the ballot language that was tested. He called the results “heartening,” and said it signaled that “many residents are paying attention to what’s happening and care so passionately about these critical services.”\n\nMost respondents surveyed were familiar with Trump’s “Big, Beautiful Bill” — 71% said they “heard a lot” about the legislation, and another 23% said they had “heard some.” A majority of those polled ultimately viewed the bill poorly, with 64% strongly opposed and 8% somewhat opposed. Negative views of the president were even higher with 70% viewing Trump as very unfavorable and 6% as somewhat unfavorable.\n\nSeventy percent of respondents voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris and 19% voted for Trump in the last election — the remaining 11% voted for someone else, didn’t vote or declined to answer. During the 2024 election, 68% of Santa Clara County voters cast their ballots for Harris and 28% for Trump.\n\n“This is a public health system that we have collectively invested in over decades,” Williams said. “That jewel of a public health system is something that the community recognizes, the community supports and that we have an opportunity to, notwithstanding what the president and Congress are doing, push back and preserve that incredible system for the benefit of all of us.”\n\nRishi Kumar, a former Saratoga councilmember and the chair of the No on Measure A campaign, said at a press conference earlier this week that the group hadn’t conducted any polling, but has surveyed many residents who say they’re against taxes — largely seniors.\n\n“This time around the seniors are going to be 60 to 70% of the total vote,” Kumar said, noting that it bodes well for the opposition. “It’s going to be a huge number because this is a special election.”\n\nOpponents of Measure A argue that increasing the sales tax rate will hurt seniors and families. They also are raising concerns about it being a general tax, meaning the money isn’t dedicated and can be spent at county officials’ discretion.\n\nDestination:Home’s Loving, however, doesn’t see why people wouldn’t support the measure.\n\n“We still have an obligation to serve our community,” she said. “I’m glad that there could be a pathway to look at least some portion of this money being supplanted so the worst of the cuts don’t have to come to fruition. There’s a lot of divisiveness, but this in my opinion shouldn’t be. This about care for about 30% of people that live in our community. That’s a massive amount of people that could be affected by federal cuts.”","summary":"The poll was conducted several weeks before the Board of Supervisors placed the measure on the November ballot.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/09/25/santa-clara-county-poll-shows-support-among-likely-voters-for-measure-a/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/SJM-L-ELECTGEN-10XX-010.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-25 12:00:01","author":"Grace Hase","authors":["Grace Hase"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.07},{"id":363434036,"title":"‘Fact-Checkers’ Pounce on Trump, Skip Over Kamala","text":"President Donald Trump’s address to the United Nations General Assembly was the latest example of how our “independent fact-checkers” are better defined as Democrat-dependent messaging machines. Their selection bias is transparent.\n\nPolitiFact was live-blogging and throwing “Pants on Fire” rulings on its X account. For example, Trump claimed we were losing 300,000 Americans to fentanyl, which is exaggerated. Trump can’t say grocery prices are down. They’re up 2.7% in 2025.\n\nCNN’s Daniel Dale was on speed dial from Canada for a televised pounce. Like the other “independents,” Dale couldn’t stand Trump taking credit for ending a list of wars, and then comes the nitpicking that some of these were disputes, not hot wars, and temporary ceasefires could be temporary. CNN’s “Facts First” website is dedicated to attacking Trump.\n\nOne may certainly argue that an American president making a speech at the United Nations is a news event worth fact-checking. But it’s all in the targeting. Try to remember Dale or PolitiFact touching on President Joe Biden’s speech to the U.N. last year. Biden was a “lame duck” in an election year, so why bother?\n\nKamala Harris is now going on a book tour. Does anyone think the “fact-checkers” will get involved? On “The Rachel Maddow Show,” Harris uncorked a whopper about Trump: “I called him at my speech on the Ellipse a tyrant. We used to compare the strength of our democracy to communist dictators. That’s what we’re dealing with right now in Donald Trump, and these titans of industry are not speaking up.”\n\nTrump is a communist dictator? That’s what’s implied. Last year, PolitiFact threw a “Pants on Fire” when Trump called Harris a communist. We can only guess that they won’t do the same in reverse. Democrats have routinely called Trump a “fascist” and compare him to Hitler and Mussolini, and PolitiFact and its ilk sit on their hands.\n\nThey don’t “fact-check” Maddow and the rest of the cable-news hotheads. Maddow said to Harris: “I feel like a lot of the defenses that we tried to build up in advance of this type of a sort of would-be authoritarian takeover were about warning people about how serious the threat was.”\n\nYou can say “authoritarian playbook” every 30 seconds and know the “fact-checkers” will not point out that Trump and the Republicans were democratically elected.\n\nHarris then boosted Jimmy Kimmel: “As it relates to the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel. We saw the power of the people over the last few days, and it spoke volumes, and it moved a decision in the right direction.”\n\nKimmel can lie his face off about Charlie Kirk’s assassin being a Trump supporter, and the “fact-checkers” didn’t ding the “comedian.” His heart’s moving in the “right direction,” so facts, schmacts.\n\nHere again, PolitiFact was perfectly partisan. There was no fact check for Kimmel’s shameless lie. But they threw a “False” flag at Fox host Sean Hannity when he suggested, “I can’t find a single, prominent conservative voice in the country that even remotely wanted or hoped or was pushing to get Jimmy Kimmel taken off the air.” He meant over the last few days. PolitiFact cried “False”—because Trump had previously tweeted that Kimmel shouldn’t be on the air.\n\nJimmy Kimmel only has two PolitiFact checks over the 18 years of their existence. “Comedians” get a break when they lie.

While it may make for good gossip, it’s a decided failure when it comes to her political future. Indeed, it is just one more major mistake that will keep her out of the 2028 campaign. Keep in mind that Harris has had a charmed life. From her upper-middle class upbringing in California, to her silver-spooned resume as San Francisco district attorney, California attorney general, U.S. senator and vice president, she has acquired quite a resume. What she hasn’t built is credibility as a leader — and her latest book only makes that matter worse. HARRIS TAPS DEM EMAILS LISTS TO MARKET NEW BOOK, SPARKING PARTY NEUTRALITY CONCERNS As the great Reagan biographer Craig Shirley recently reminded us, successful politics is a game of addition. With her latest book, \"107 Days,\" which is a tell-all about her 2024 presidential campaign, Harris reminds everyone that she never understood that basic principle. Here are five major career mistakes along those lines and why they spell doom for any 2028 presidential hopes. 5. Harris’ \"Political\" Breakup With Willy Brown. The world knows about Kamala Harris’ romantic relationship with Willy Brown. However, many likely don’t know that Brown used to provide Harris with sage advice for her career. Willy Brown was, and remains, a smart politician. As a leader in California politics, he got things done and never let ideology or partisanship stop him. He was a practical politician. Brown essentially made her the San Francisco district attorney and while she listened to him, Harris was not too far left. Indeed, while she was campaigning in 2019, Harris had to distance herself from her middle of the road record as a DA. The farther Harris has traveled from Brown, including an unceremonious political breakup, the farther left Harris became and the less practical — losing independents along the way. 4. Harris Never Properly Engaged in Retail Politics. Harris has always taken her good political fortune for granted. The field was cleared for her to run for California attorney general — so, she hardly campaigned. She had an easy go of it in becoming US senator from California (a one-media state with lopsided voter registration) — even though she lost a post-Senate debate poll to me, 38 percent to 32 percent, in April 2016 in that race. What she should have done in those years was work within the state relentlessly to build alliances with voters, politicians and leaders — the game of addition. By not developing those necessary alliances, when it came time to run for president in early 2020, she was placing fourth in California primary polling with candidates like Elizabeth Warren ahead of her. By being weak in California, instead of the runaway leader in California and locking up its nearly 500 delegates, Harris was not taken seriously in Iowa and South Carolina in January 2020. That is why I was the first in the nation to predict on national TV, (Fox and Friends), that Harris would not enter the Iowa Caucuses. She didn’t enter Iowa and dropped out. No addition, no race. 3. Harris Never Cultivated Democrat Leaders. Even though Harris didn’t enter the presidential race, she was picked as Biden’s vice president — she was the right identity politics choice at the right time among Democrats. Even so, she squandered that amazing fortune and opportunity. Any vice president with presidential ambitions has a very clear path to follow. Go around the country and help other people in your party get elected. Vice presidents should add friends relentlessly so that when they run, they can use those relationships for help. Addition. Harris was not famous for doing that. If you are not famous for that as vice president, you failed at that. Harris failed at that. 2. Harris Never Took Responsibility for Her Campaign. The scuttlebutt about her book, \"107 Days,\" is that Harris didn’t take ownership for not winning in 2024. Instead of taking responsibility for why she fell short, Harris decided to blame others. Nor has Harris ever taken responsibility for how money was spent wildly on her campaign, including the purchasing of celebrity endorsements. Donors like accountability and responsibility. A billion spent, but no addition. Indeed, blaming others and attacking them is politics by subtraction. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION 1. Harris Has Never Established Her Vision For The Future. Finally, amidst it all, Harris has spent her time not establishing her vision for the future. Her first post-election book represented a huge opportunity for someone who wants to be considered a leader. Her whole career she has been considered light on policy and she could have used this entire book to address that weakness. Instead of using that opportunity to outline her vision of the future, Harris spent her time writing about the past. Everyone knows, however, that elections are about the future. Leadership is about addressing the future, not lamenting the past. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Willy Brown always knew that. Harris never learned that. In the final analysis, Harris has never been up to the job of a leader. She was handed much of her success and didn’t earn it. She doesn’t have the instincts or drive to be president — no matter how many days she was given in the spotlight.","summary":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris faces criticism for her new book and leadership approach, with experts questioning her political future after the 2024 campaign.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/from-tell-all-end-all-former-vice-president-kamala-harris-5-big-career-mistakes","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/09/kamala-harris-book-107-days.jpg","video":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6380034262112","publish_date":"2025-09-25 11:00:32","author":"Tom Del Beccaro","authors":["Tom Del Beccaro"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.163},{"id":363389274,"title":"'Very talented': Harris reveals Jasmine Crockett was part of 'secret project' of lawmakers she was mentoring","text":"Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, was among a select group of Democrats who then-Vice President Kamala Harris sought to bolster via a top secret \"Stars Project,\" the 2024 White House hopeful’s new memoir reveals. Harris dove deep into her brief presidential campaign in a new book released on Tuesday called \"107 Days,\" with the title referencing the time between the beginning and end of her 2024 bid. In one section, Harris discussed planning the Democratic National Convention (DNC) and said it was \"in the party’s interest to highlight our stars, while we make it as entertaining as possible.\" 58 HOUSE DEMS VOTE AGAINST RESOLUTION HONORING 'LIFE AND LEGACY' OF CHARLIE KIRK \"When I became VP, I had a secret project – I called it the Stars Project – that only my senior team knew about. We’d brainstorm about the younger talents in the party and then, on Friday afternoons, I’d invite one or another to visit my office in the West Wing or the residence,\" Harris wrote. Several were nervous, she recounted, but Harris recalled telling them, \"No, I think you’re very talented. What are you working on, and how can I help you?\" FAR-LEFT FIREBRAND SAYS SHE 'NEVER HAD A CONCERN' ABOUT BIDEN'S MENTAL STATE \"Many of those on my list spoke at the convention: Lauren Underwood, Robert Garcia, Angela Alsobrooks, Lateefah Simon, Maxwell Frost, Joe Neguse, Lina Hidalgo, Jasmine Crockett,\" Harris listed. Crockett, who has received backlash from conservatives for comparing ICE to \"slave patrols\" and supporting defunding police, appeared to reference the passage in content she cross-posted on her personal Instagram account. The post was from a Texas politics-based account called \"howdypolitics\" that shared, \"Kamala Harris had a secret project only known to senior staff called the ‘Stars Project,’ to privately mentor rising stars in the party. She made sure that many of them received speaking slots during the convention. That is what Jasmine Crockett was talking about in her speech at the DNC.\" Crockett did reference a meeting with Harris in her speech at the DNC in summer 2024. \"When I first got to Congress, I wasn't sure I made the right decision. The chaos caucus couldn't elect a speaker and the Oversight Committee was unhinged. I was going through all of this when I visited the vice president's residence for the first time. As I approached Vice President Harris for our official photo, she turned to me and asked, ‘What's wrong?’\" Crockett recalled. \"Mind you, we'd never met. But she saw right through me. She saw the distress. I immediately began crying, and the most powerful woman in the world wiped my tears and listened.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP She said Harris told her, \"You are exactly where God wants you. Your district chose you because they believe in you. And so do I.\" \"The next month I went viral for the first of many times to come for hitting Republicans with a dose of their own medicine. That brief but impactful interaction gave me my legislative legs and I've been running ever since,\" Crockett said. Crockett recently ignited backlash from conservatives after slamming White lawmakers for honoring Charlie Kirk after his assassination. \"And to be clear, you can wave all the flags you want to, but I am telling you right now that the most unpatriotic people that we have in this country are MAGA and this president. We are the real patriots. And it is time for us to take our flag back and show people what America is about,\" she said.

Let’s see how we do,” the president wrote on Truth Social. “Last time I went after them, they gave me $16 Million Dollars. This one sounds even more lucrative.”\n\nTrump has leaned heavily on the courts during his second term to challenge media outlets, but as of Wednesday night, the president’s legal team has not brought a new lawsuit against ABC, for predictable reasons, according to experts.\n\nBrett Kappel, a campaign finance attorney with Harmon, Curran, Spielberg & Eisenberg, told Forbes that Kimmel’s on-air comments are “clearly covered” as protected speech by the Federal Election Commission’s media exemption and do not amount to campaign contributions, as Trump claimed.\n\nWhile the FEC explicitly bars media corporations from directly contributing to campaigns, the media exemption specifically allows for broadcasting stations or periodical publications to publish “any news story, commentary, or editorial” that may influence an election, as long as an involved candidate or political party does not own the station or publication.\n\nElection law scholar Ned Foley similarly wrote in a Wednesday blog post that Trump’s threat is “incredibly alarming” on First Amendment and election law grounds. \n\n“Accusing ABC of being an arm of the DNC and its content as being an illegal campaign contribution is the equivalent of accusing any media outlet of engaging in prohibited speech simply for engaging in political commentary,” he wrote, pointing to the FEC’s media exemption. “There is no credible claim, despite Trump’s insinuation, that ABC is ‘owned or controlled by’ the Democratic National Committee, just as there would be no credible claim that The New York Times or any other liberal-leaning media outlet is.”\n\nWhite House officials directed inquiries about a possible new lawsuit against ABC back to the president’s Tuesday statement on Truth Social.\n\nThe Supreme Court previously ruled in 1963’s Bantam Books v. Sullivan that government officials or bodies cannot leverage government authority to censor private parties.\n\n“People do not lightly disregard public officers’ thinly veiled threats to institute criminal proceedings against them if they do not come around,” Justice William J. Brennan Jr. wrote at the time. “It would be naïve to credit the state’s assertion that these blacklists are in the nature of mere legal advice, when they plainly serve as instruments of regulation independent of the laws against obscenity.”\n\nAnd the court itself reaffirmed Bantam Books last year, when the National Rifle Association, defended by the American Civil Liberties Union, claimed a New York state official had violated the First Amendment by pressuring companies to end their ties to the NRA in the wake of the 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.\n\n“Bantam Books stands for the principle that a government official cannot do indirectly what she is barred from doing directly: A government official cannot coerce a private party to punish or suppress disfavored speech on her behalf,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in a unanimous opinion for the court.\n\nTrump does have a long history of suing media companies, including a handful of successful lawsuits filed on the 2024 campaign trail and since entering office in January.\n\nIn December of last year, as referenced in Trump’s Tuesday night statement responding to Kimmel’s return, ABC settled a defamation lawsuit brought by Trump against the network and anchor George Stephanopoulos for $15 million.\n\nParamount settled a lawsuit with the president’s legal team in July for $16 million regarding an interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris that aired ahead of the 2024 general election.\n\nThough the White House technically lost a lawsuit brought by the Associated Press this spring, the president was still able to spin it as a win for his base by amending the way that all wire publications were included in the routine press pool rotations.\n\nStill, a number of the president’s legal fights with the media remain unresolved or have been thrown out of court.\n\nEarlier in September, a federal judge threw out Trump’s $15 billion defamation suit against the New York Times, although the decision did give Trump’s legal team a month to refile.\n\nAnd in July, the president brought a $10 billion lawsuit against The Wall Street Journal and owner Rupert Murdoch regarding the paper’s coverage of a letter, allegedly penned by Trump to disgraced financier and sex criminal Jeffrey Epstein, to be included in a book gifted to the latter for his 50th birthday.","summary":"President Donald Trump’s hints at bringing a new lawsuit against ABC appear to lack legal teeth, according to experts and recent judicial precedent.

On Monday, Harris appeared on MSNBC’s The Rachel Maddow Show to promote her new book, 107 Days, which reveals many bombshells about her short-lived campaign last November.\n\nKamala Harris’s comments came as she tried to explain the “unprecedented” nature of her candidacy during the 2024 election. “The sitting vice president enters the race against a former president of the United States who’s been running for 10 years, with 107 days to go. And it ended up being the closest presidential election in the 21st Century,” the former VP mused.\n\n“And there was so much about those 107 days that, for me, and this is really a behind-the-scenes look at those 107 days, was about seeing people who seemingly had nothing in common coming together by the thousands, with a level of optimism and, dare I say joy, about the possibilities for America. And I hope to remind people about that light that people brought to it, and to remind people that that light is still there,” she added.\n\nHowever, Donald Trump seemed to disagree with the Democrat, as he branded her statement as a “lie” in his Truth Social post on Wednesday. “Kamala Harris, who is DUMB AS A ROCK, is going around and using, as a standard part of her Speech on why she lost the Election, that 2024 was the ‘closest Presidential Election in the 21st Century.’ Everyone knows this is a lie, and was covered as such by Fox News!”\n\nTrump then pointed out the metrics of his wins in the Electoral College. He wrote, “I won the Electoral College, 312-226, a LANDSLIDE, Counties Nationwide, 2,600 to 525, a LANDSLIDE, all seven Swing States, a LANDSLIDE, and, despite the fact that California’s Fake Mail In Ballots came in at ridiculous numbers (It was RIGGED!), I still won the Popular Vote by MILLIONS!”\n\nThe POTUS continued, “Bush, as an example, won the Election by 537 Votes, and many other Elections were very close. Kamala’s ‘closest in the 21st Century’ soundbite was, like everything else in the Democrat Party, A TOTAL LIE! I expect an apology. Thank you for your attention to this matter!”\n\nAlthough it remains unclear, based on which metric Kamala Harris made her comments, last year’s contest wasn’t the closest since 2000, according to several indicators. According to the Daily Beast, the 2024 Electoral College margin of 312-226 was the fifth smallest, among the seven elections held since 2000.\n\nThe former Vice President hasn’t yet revealed how she arrived at that conclusion, and whether she would issue an apology remains unknown.","summary":"Trump branded her statement as a \"lie\" and demanded an apology.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/everyone-knows-this-is-a-lie-donald-trump-demands-apology-over-kamala-harriss-bold-claim","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Donald-Trump-Takes-Offense-At-Kamala-Harriss-Election-Claim.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-25 10:24:42","author":"Moupriya","authors":["Moupriya"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.019},{"id":363362022,"title":"Graham Platner Hopes to Win Susan Collins’s Maine Senate Seat in 2026","text":"The video was produced by Morris Katz, a top political strategist for New York City’s Democratic mayoral candidate, Zohran Mamdani. “Within a few minutes of talking to him, I was, like, ‘This guy owes it to the country to run for Senate,’ ” Katz recalled, of his first meeting with Platner. The video was meant to present the forty-one-year-old Maine native as a rugged and likable working-class Democratic candidate running to unseat Susan Collins, but it could just as easily have been the opener for a reality-TV show called “Oyster Man.” A macho pastiche with a Jeep-commercial soundtrack, it shows him diving in his wetsuit, chopping wood, hauling oyster cages, and doing kettlebell swings. There are closeups of his tattoos, along with shots of him holding hands with his wife, Amy Gertner, as they walk along a beach with their two dogs. Standing at the helm of his boat, Platner tells the camera, “When I tell people around here that I’m running for Senate, sometimes the initial reaction is, ‘What the ——?’ ” There’s a bleeped-out expletive, and Platner laughs. Then he gets serious: “It seems like the fabric of what holds us together is being ripped apart by billionaires and corrupt politicians profiting off destroying our environment, driving our families into poverty, and crushing the middle class.”\nThe campaign rollout, which was orchestrated by Platner’s senior adviser, Joe Calvello (John Fetterman’s former director of communications), raised half a million dollars in its first four days; volunteer sign-ups for the campaign averaged three hundred a day. “No one was expecting this,” Calvello told me. The Times, ABC, NBC, and Fox News covered the launch, focussing on Platner as a political novice who represented a new approach for the Party. “Platner has never run for office and seldom wears a suit,” Mother Jones noted. The launch video was viewed more than two and a half million times on X in the first twenty-four hours alone. The streamer and leftist commentator Hasan Piker showed it on his Twitch channel, where comments included “TAX THE RICH AND EAT THE OYSTERS” and “Wow this guy looks like a progressive mind in [a] MAGA body.”\nThat morning in August, I met Platner at the launch, and he drove us out on his boat to his oyster farm on the bay. It’s situated off an island with a ledge so rocky that lobstermen know not to drop traps there; Platner keeps tow ropes on hand in case he needs to help stranded boaters. The haze from Canadian wildfires, which covered the bay for much of the summer, had lifted, and Mt. Cadillac, on Mt. Desert Island, was a bright green. Once we were moored, Platner pointed out the busy wildlife: bald eagles, osprey.\nEarlier in the summer, a few weeks before Graham Platner fever swept Maine and beyond, a group of mostly millennial Democrats, coördinating with Maine labor leaders, community activists, and volunteers, many of them Bernie Sanders campaign alums, had been scouting the state for a candidate who could unseat Collins. These Democrats thought that the five-term, seventy-two-year-old Republican senator was vulnerable: her approval ratings were down, and Kamala Harris had won the state in 2024. After they saw a video featuring Platner—this one made by the local Frenchman Bay Conservancy in 2020, to stop a commercial salmon farm from building in the bay—they decided that he was exactly what they were looking for: a working-class guy with a military background and a deep connection to Maine.\nJason Shedlock, the president of the Southern Maine Labor Council, was involved in the search (and was the only member of the group who would speak on the record). “What we’re looking for is someone who understands that solidarity is not a spectator sport, it’s an action word,” Shedlock said. He heard that Platner was “the real deal.” They had their first conversation over Zoom. “The Zoom camera was bobbing up and down because he was on an oyster boat, and I just got off of a job site, and we had the conversation right then and there, with the wind blowing, and it was like talking to somebody who I would meet in a union hall.”\nSeveral Maine labor figures reached out to Katz and Calvello, who closed the deal. Platner was taken by surprise by their interest. “They’re, like, ‘We think that right now Susan Collins is uniquely weak,’ ” he told me. “We think the Democrats are going to choose a bad candidate for this race specifically, and we think that you’re a good candidate for this. And Amy and I promptly told them, ‘That’s fucking insane. We work full time. We don’t have any money.’ . . . We’re just normal fucking people who have very busy schedules, and running for U.S. Senate is the most ridiculous thing that I could’ve ever heard for myself.” Platner pulled up a cage. He lifted out a mesh bag full of tiny oysters, each the size of a pumpkin seed, explaining that as the oysters grow they need more space. “It’s very much like gardening,” he said. “I’m just thinning.”\nThe scouting group told Platner and Gertner that they had two weeks to think it over. “About three days into it, we were, like, ‘All right, we don’t really want to, but we might have to,’ ” Platner said. “This might be another sacrifice that needs to be made in the service of the country.”\nKatz considered this hesitancy a good sign. “So much of what’s broken in our politics is we have these people who think about running for office through the lens of attaining more power for themselves,” he told me later. “They’re eager. They think they’re, you know, entitled to something, and Graham was kind of the opposite. And I think reluctant public servants tend to be the best ones.”\nPlatner heard through some friends in D.C. that the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee wasn’t thrilled with the idea of his, or any other upstart’s, candidacy. “They’re not psyched about a larger primary field,” Platner told me. (The D.S.C.C. did not respond to a request for comment.) The growing field of candidates running in the June 2026 Democratic primary includes the Maine Beer Company co-founder Dan Kleban and Jordan Wood, who served as the former California congresswoman Katie Porter’s chief of staff, and who has raised more than $1.3 million so far; the New York senator Chuck Schumer has reportedly encouraged Maine’s two-term governor, Janet Mills, to enter the race.\nIn our conversation on his boat, Platner seemed undaunted. “I want the community that I am from to succeed,” he said. “I want the state that allowed me to come home, to give me this frankly spectacular life that I get to live, I want that to work, because there is no point in living a good life if all of your neighbors are getting fucked.” He interrupted himself. “Oh, there’s the harbor seal right here. The seals always come over. They want to see what’s going on.” There at the stern of the skiff was a small harbor seal locking eyes with me.\nIt would be a big leap from harbormaster to senator. Did he worry about not having enough qualifications? “We’ve been sending qualified people up there for a long time, and it’s just fucked everybody,” Platner said. “If you have a good read of American history, it shows that almost every single good thing we have ever gotten comes from people organizing, building power, and fighting for the shit that they need.”\nPlatner went to the United States Marine Corps School of Infantry and deployed to Iraq in 2005. “It was a relatively calm deployment for the first few months, mostly because the Battle of Fallujah just happened, and much of the insurgent activity in the area had been crushed in that fight,” he told me. Later, while he was on patrol at Abu Ghraib, there was an attack on the prison. (It was nearly two years after human-rights abuses were first reported at the prison; Platner was not involved.) “That was my first real taste of combat,” he said. It was an odd juxtaposition discussing Platner’s experiences in the Iraq War while looking out at the islands on Frenchman Bay. “I loved infantry combat,” he said. “It was like this kind of high-stakes game where everything you do matters and you need to make decisions under immense amounts of stress that are going to impact both your life, but more importantly, the lives of your men.”\nHis next deployment was in Ramadi. “From the moment we step off the birds, it is just eight months of essentially constant contact. I look back on it now, and I really don’t quite know how any of us got through it without breaking. We didn’t have a day off,” he said. Platner’s third tour was with a Marine Expeditionary Unit. “We bounced around the Indian Ocean. We’d go ashore and do some training in Kuwait, Djibouti, some liberty ports, stopping in the Seychelles. We did some anti-piracy stuff off of Somalia.” He returned to the U.S. in 2008 with only a few months left in his contract. “I have a bunch of leaves saved up, so I take something called terminal leave, which allows me to leave the Marine Corps early.”\nPlatner enrolled in George Washington University, but he felt out of place among his fellow-students. “I hated going to school, but I loved the learning part,” he said. He tried to rejoin the Marines but he had several forearm tattoos, which were newly banned by Marine policy, so instead he joined the Army. “I’m in Afghanistan, watching my unit do the same dumb bullshit that I watched my unit doing outside Fallujah, in ’05. It’s six years later.” Disillusioned with American foreign policy, Platner returned to Washington, D.C. He remembers it as a dark period in his life: “I hit thirty, dealing with all the usual things that come out of heavy combat service—depression, anxiety, loss of sense of belonging.” Platner moved around D.C. and bartended at the Tune Inn, on Capitol Hill, but he knew that he was in rough shape. “I clearly had a lot of undiagnosed P.T.S.D.”\nWhile Platner was in D.C., Jock Crothers, a resident of the town of Sorrento, Maine, and the founder of the Waukeag Neck Oyster Company, reached out. He was getting older and knew that he needed someone to take over the business. He and his wife, Lisa Heyward, a Frenchman Bay Conservancy board member, had read about how farming was an ideal job for veterans. “It’s not nine to five,” Crothers told me. “You have to pay attention to what the tide and the weather’s doing. You’re working with your hands, and you’re outdoors.” In a coastal community where everyone knows one another, Crothers had been acquainted with Platner’s family for years. He had seen Platner at a friend’s holiday gathering and “knew he was a little bit at loose ends.”\nAs Platner pulled an oyster cage from the water and tied the line onto the skiff he thought back to when he didn’t know how any of it worked. “The first time I ate the oysters, I was, like, Holy shit,” Platner said. “I’m ready to be an oyster farmer.” With the aid of a Department of Veterans Affairs low-interest mortgage, Platner bought a house down the street from where he grew up. He feels indebted to the Maine V.A., which gave him a higher disability rating, resulting in higher compensation: “It provides me with all of my health care, provides me with a ton of support, and, without exaggeration, it saves my life.”\nPlatner had already met Gertner, an elementary- and middle-school art teacher, through friends before they matched on Bumble, and the couple wed last fall. “She married a small-town oyster farmer,” he observed. “Running for U.S. Senate was not part of that fucking deal.”\nI asked Platner if he plans to stop swearing when he runs for office. “I know what rooms not to swear in,” he said. “But what I’m not gonna do is purposely change my personality, or put on some kind of adaptation to try to appeal to folks.”\nPlatner’s campaign launch was big news at the local boatyard, where several Trump supporters said that they would vote for him. A local yard worker who had voted for the man he referred to as “Uncle Donnie” stood nearby during his lunch break and spoke with a faint Down East accent. “So I’ve actually known Graham for years,” he told me, “and his service to our country is a really big thing, and, you know, his values in that manner I really respect. . . . He’s kind of a redneck, blue-collar guy, and, you know, I think he could represent us really well versus what we have for options.” He added, “He’s not really a politician, which I love about him.”\nThe man told me that he was most concerned about health care and sanctuary cities. When asked about his own health care, he replied, “Well, we don’t have any. It costs—you know, to get insurance or whatever—it’s astronomical. I’m a father of six kids. I have a wife at home.” He told me that he recently received a thirty-thousand-dollar bill for emergency surgery for a ruptured appendix, a bill that he cannot pay.\nI arrived early at the Unitarian Universalist Church in the city of Ellsworth, a building that could almost be mistaken for a mid-century ranch home, for Platner’s official Senate launch. (The church is also where Acadia Action, a local activist group, regularly meets; Platner co-organized the organization’s anti-Trump protest in Ellsworth last March.) In the parking lot, I saw several bumper stickers for Sara Gideon, the Democratic candidate who lost to Collins in 2020. Inside, volunteers were setting up in the modest sanctuary. Platner’s official speech was scheduled for 7 P.M. “Graham Platner for U.S. Senate” posters hung on the walls; large, blue campaign buttons were spread out on one table, volunteer and donation sign-up sheets on another. Gertner walked in with a large container of clipboards.\nThere were more than a hundred people in the packed sanctuary and almost five hundred watching on Zoom. Leslie Harlow introduced her son and, after she mentioned that she and Platner’s father had been confused when their child joined the military, Platner’s father, Bronson, called out from the audience, “I wasn’t confused. I was just opposed!” The crowd laughed. Platner addressed the mostly white older audience for twenty-two minutes about his concerns over policy failures and the unchecked power of billionaires. He also went after his party. “The Democrats have lost the working class,” Platner told the room. “Instead of showing up for working people over the past thirty years, in many ways they sold them out.”\nPlatner’s first meet and greet as a candidate was three nights later at the Sorrento Library. He wore a white button-down shirt with the sleeves rolled up, revealing his forearm tattoos. There, Platner spoke to an audience of a hundred and ten, from a makeshift lectern made of a floating lobster crate and a wooden side table, adorned with red-white-and-blue bunting. In the back, several volunteers were shucking a hundred and fifty Waukeag Neck oysters. It wasn’t that long ago that it would have been Platner doing the shucking. Platner looked tired but relaxed in front of the crowd, many of whom have known him his entire life. He spoke off the cuff about the issues affecting folks in Maine and across the nation: health care, the cost of living, Social Security, and how grassroots organizing can beat the establishment. He seemed more himself than he had been at the church. There were eruptions of applause and nodding heads as Platner told the gathering,“There’s a great saying in the nautical world: a rising tide lifts all ships.”\nAfter his speech, supporters lined up to talk, hug, and take selfies with the candidate. He told several people that no one from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee had called him. He also broke the news that his company’s oyster tours would be cancelled for the rest of the season, as he needed to focus on the campaign. A week later, Bernie Sanders endorsed Platner, before appearing with him at a Labor Day rally: “He’s a Mainer through and through, and he is building a movement strong enough to take on the oligarchy that is making Maine unaffordable for all except a privileged few.”\n“It’s going to be a knife fight,” Joe Calvello, Platner’s senior adviser, said, of his chances. “Maine has eluded Democrats for a long, long time. This Senate seat, specifically, we thought they had it in ’20. . . . It’s the white whale.” A recent internal poll has Platner ahead of Collins by twelve points, with a fifteen-point lead over Mills, who has not officially entered the race, in a one-on-one contest. According to the same poll, after two weeks, he was already at forty per cent name recognition among Maine Democratic primary voters. Calvello was most excited by that number. “It’s a tough race. Many have gone and failed,” he said, “but we’re not going to fail.”\nIt’s too early to say whether this relatively unknown oyster farmer can carry his current momentum all the way to the Senate, but some people think he can. Cora Hilts, who carpooled with Platner to John Bapst Memorial High School, in Bangor, an hour’s drive each way, remembered him as someone who defied expectation. “He was the captain of the wrestling team at the same time that he was playing Henry Higgins in a musical,” she said, of the teen-age Platner, who had starred in a school production of “My Fair Lady.” When Hilts’s mother read about Platner’s Senate run, she told her daughter, “Well, I guess Henry Higgins is going to the Senate.” ♦","summary":"Graham Platner, a local veteran, is angling to take on Susan Collins, who may be vulnerable in her 2026 reëlection bid—and is drawing support from both sides of the aisle.","url":"https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-political-scene/can-a-maine-oyster-farmer-defeat-a-five-term-republican-senator","image":"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/68d17fc4c538643b1202dbe8/16:9/w_2376,h_1337,c_limit/Shapiro_Platner_GRybus_NY-Platner-HR-01-1831.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-25 10:00:00","author":"Lisa Wood Shapiro","authors":["Lisa Wood Shapiro"],"language":"en","category":"sports","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.109},{"id":363401496,"title":"How Leonardo DiCaprio Gets Away With It","text":"Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nWhat is it with our affection for famous actors who don’t want to be famous actors? It’s a unique kiss of reputational death for a public figure to be too interested in being a public figure. The more an actor eschews public affection, the more affection we have for him—Cillian Murphy, for example, now promoting his Netflix movie Steve, is making a meal out of hating public attention as a part of the movie’s promotional cycle. But has anyone been more famous and yet less entrenched in fame than one of the most celebrated actors in the world, recognizable even by a nickname, an undeniable face since he was a kid wearing flannel and denim on ’80s shows? No one hates and therefore courts fame quite like an actor with no real interest in it, and Leonardo DiCaprio has, for his entire career, remained dutifully disinterested in a main part of the gig.\n\nYou know him already: delicate hairless jaw in the ’80s and ’90s, hair falling effortlessly over his forehead like Tuxedo Mask’s, Siberian husky blue eyes, lips lightly pursed as if he has a secret (the secret is he knows you want to fuck him). For Gen X and elder millennials, DiCaprio was the blueprint for an attractive straight white man, someone sensitive enough to get you to cry with him in Romeo + Juliet but still masculine enough to make you clench your jaw with desire when he danced with Rose in Titanic. Even going back to 1998, Seventeen magazine labeled him “the reluctant Romeo” in their cover story, right after Titanic came out and made nearly $53 million domestically at the box office on its opening weekend. Former co-stars, casting directors, magazine editors, hairstylists, and crew members waxed poetic about DiCaprio’s dual charm and inconspicuousness. “He’s one of those young men who doesn’t want to be a movie star,” a casting director told the magazine. “He really wants to be known for his acting, not for his looks.” Kate Winslet called him “the world’s most beautiful-looking man, but yet he doesn’t think that he’s gorgeous.” Alan Thicke called him a “cutup, clown, and lighthearted free spirit” on the set of Growing Pains. An old teacher called him “disruptive in a charming way.”\n\n“What’s his secret?” Seventeen asked when DiCaprio was just 23. “Leonardo is a thinking, sensitive girl’s heartthrob. He exudes a vulnerability that girls crave.”\n\nNow 50, DiCaprio has had the kind of career trajectory most overly buff male leads could only dream of: child star to teen heartthrob to prestige-drama actor to climate activist, all while remaining mostly scandal-free. Through it all, DiCaprio has somehow maintained a game audience of Scorsese-heads and squealing 42-year-old girl-women with a decades-long crush. People want to see his movies and root for him at the Oscars. DiCaprio is no stranger to awards-bait, and his latest movie, One Battle After Another, is premiering to rave reviews. Even the lesbians love him.\n\nBut take a closer look at his more recent record, and DiCaprio starts to get a little slimy. At his big age, he seems pathologically incapable of dating a woman older than 27. His filmography remains pretty unimpeachable, but his record as a climate activist is a joke; lately, he’s been spending time on megayachts with Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez. (Much like Katy Perry, fellow Bezos friend and bleeding-heart Democrat, DiCaprio stumped for Kamala Harris while Bezos killed op-eds in the Washington Post supporting her presidential candidacy.) His relationships with the uber-rich go well beyond the founder of Amazon—his friendship with fugitive businessman Jho Low landed DiCaprio in at least one deposition. His latest business stunt is his co-financing of a luxury hotel near Tel Aviv, one being built not too far from an active genocide.\n\nLeo might be the last true Gen X star, someone who’s managing to get away with it all. He’s an untouchable Hollywood actor who only works on the most impressive prestige projects with select directors, and who can fuck around without ever seeming to find out. Fellow big-time movie stars like Tom Cruise and Johnny Depp and Brad Pitt have incurred some light reputational damage, either for rumors around their own cultish behavior or allegedly abusing their wives or children. But DiCaprio has evaded almost all criticism, and almost all retribution. His hypocrisy is noted, but never really held against him. While other famous people have all been raked over the coals for their participation in the Sánchez-Bezos wedding (all women, no less), DiCaprio skated on by from behind a black baseball cap.\n\nHow does he manage to get away with it all? Is he just the right age—and perhaps the final age—for an actor who can double-dip as both a pious liberal and a member of the indulgent class? Are his movies actually just that good? Or is there something pleasing for us, as a rapt audience, in watching a guy be an Actor’s Actor without being all that harmful or annoying? Our Overton window for bad male behavior has moved so much in the past decade; is it so bad that this 50-year-old multimillionaire has a penchant for dating women barely old enough to rent a car?\n\nChild stars come in a few forms, but DiCaprio is the luckiest version of them: no drug scandals, no noisy affairs, no children, no marriages, no divorces. Born and raised in Los Angeles in the mid-’70s, he started acting in commercials like this ’80s-era ad for Bubble Yum and this one for Kraft Cheese as a kid. DiCaprio wasn’t a child star in the way we think of it now—a kid crowded by a parent pushing him to make YouTube shorts or to become an influencer, though his high school drama teacher said his mother was “determined” to make him “a famous television and movie star.” In the early ’90s, he was cast as yet another precocious kid on ABC’s Growing Pains before getting the first of several lucky breaks, when he was cast alongside another Tiger Beat fixture, Johnny Depp, in What’s Eating Gilbert Grape. His role, as the intellectually disabled son of a physically disabled woman (a movie unlikely to be made today), got him his first Oscar nomination when he was still just a teenager.\n\nBut oh, nothing turned DiCaprio into “Leo”—a household name said, ideally, with a heavy, yearning, virginal (for me, at least) sigh—quite like his 1997 role as Jack in Titanic. In one movie—back when he was still an unknown, and when a three-hour movie about a boat by James Cameron was considered a huge gamble—he rewrote the rules of what a leading man should be. He lacked the punchable jaw or heaving pecs of an action star of the era, and instead made audiences fall in love with a gentler version of a man. “DiCaprio, 23, doesn’t have the size or muscled body of most movie heroes; he’s very young, slender, even rather delicate,” read New York magazine’s review. “DiCaprio’s cockiness is completely engaging (there’s a fundament of gallantry and decency in it).” Review after review of Titanic called DiCaprio “feminine,” not said as an insult but more with bewilderment. Male reviewers and audiences seemed to be wondering out loud: Women like this? \n\nLetting go of that flotsam and drowning in the Atlantic Ocean was the first in a career of stellar role choices. In fact, DiCaprio has hardly ever done a bad movie; since Titanic’s release almost 30 years ago, he has acted in 22 movies, and there’s not one true bomb among them. Catch Me If You Can, The Departed, Gangs of New York, The Wolf of Wall Street, Django Unchained, The Revenant, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood—DiCaprio has perfected the role of an unforgivable, highly suspect, morally duplicitous man either at the height of his power or at the nadir of his competence. In this clear way, DiCaprio has set himself apart from other actors around his age: He makes good movies that people want to see, and that reviewers want to lavish praise upon.\n\nBut he also picks characters with clear, unmistakable rot, and surely opposites attract even in art. Could someone actually evil play a slave owner in Django Unchained? Could a real liar be so good at playing a master con artist in Catch Me If You Can? DiCaprio has never been more pathetic than when playing a mostly ignored scientist who eventually cheats on his very nice wife with a cruel television news anchor in Don’t Look Up; at the same time, he was dutifully unmarried and doing whatever the fuck he wanted because he could. His characters are often morally compromised (Blood Diamond) or delusional (Shutter Island) or despairing beyond repair (Inception) or terrified (The Departed). Only sometimes do they get catharsis, and only in a cruel way: His character in Catch Me If You Can gets to work with the FBI, but not before losing everything he scammed so hard to get. His character in Gangs of New York kills and steals in order to maintain dominance. His character in Don’t Look Up dies, alongside everyone else. He’s such a good actor that DiCaprio doesn’t just feed into the myths about these characters (like the scammer with a heart of gold in Catch Me If You Can), but into the mythos around himself, too.\n\nHe’s rarely in comedies or romances—unless you count Don’t Look Up, which was more of a horror movie that continues to be a little too prescient about our current moment—and he frequently works with the same prestige directors over and over again. Six movies with Martin Scorsese, two with Quentin Tarantino, two with Baz Luhrmann, and one each with Steven Spielberg, Christopher Nolan, and Paul Thomas Anderson. It’s a page taken, it seems, from actors a decade DiCaprio’s senior: Brad Pitt, George Clooney, Tom Cruise. The bigger the movie star, the more he returns to the same director, creating a canon that speaks not just to creative interests but the stories the actor wants to tell. DiCaprio isn’t a mere participant in a movie, he’s a co-conspirator. He’s no longer a mere actor: He’s a director of our culture.\n\nThere is also an adroitness in the projects DiCaprio picks. He’s unflinchingly sincere in his performances, and he picks projects that demand such earnestness and good faith. In his latest movie, One Battle After Another, he plays a washed-up former revolutionary, out of whack and out of shape, now tasked with saving his teenage daughter from ruthless enemies. “DiCaprio is a perfect vessel,” the Atlantic wrote in their review. “He’s still plausible as the youthful action hero of the first chunk of the film, but he’s also loaded with pathos and expert comic timing.” It’s an underrated tactic for getting people to be more interested in your work than your sometimes-lurid personal life: Don’t shit where you eat, and be really good at your job.\n\nYou know the old joke, right? Leonardo DiCaprio gets older, but the girls he dates stay the same age. For the past 30 years, he’s been linked to women in their mid-20s while he’s aged his way into an AARP membership. In the ’90s, there were models like Naomi Cambell and Amber Valletta. In the early aughts, there were models like Gisele Bündchen and Bar Refaeli. In the 2010s, there were models like Erin Heatherton and Kelly Rohrbach. These days, he’s dating Italian pharmaceutical engineer Vittoria Ceretti. (Just kidding: She’s a model.)\n\nBefore Ceretti—who is a decrepit 27 years old—there was the Leo 25 Rule, since it seemed he had an age limit for who he’d date, capped at a tender 25. It’s even a joke within Hollywood circles. When Sabrina Carpenter turned 25 in 2024, she blew out candles on a cake with DiCaprio’s face on it alongside the caption from a meme about him: “Nooo don’t turn 25 your so sexy aha.”\n\nThere’s nothing inherently wrong or duplicitous about DiCaprio’s dating life. In fact, he seems to have taken a page out of the pre-Amal Clooney handbook: Make good movies, and enjoy your flavor(s) of the week. The women he dates, though young, are consenting adults, and there are virtually no substantive rumors about cruelty, abuse, unkindness, or even indifference between him and the women he courts. DiCaprio isn’t a pervert, just a cad, and a mostly traditional one: His version of womanizing is more reminiscent of early Hollywood tomfoolery than sexual manipulation. It’s almost a relief for an exhausted female audience to be able to enjoy a lightly slutty man without worrying too deeply about his secret malfeasance. You want to hurt a 45-year-old straight woman’s feelings? Tell her DiCaprio just got #MeToo’d.\n\nEven if DiCaprio is a quasi-famous lothario, it’s still hard to track his personal romantic history with the sincere excellence of his artistic work. There were several members of the “Pussy Posse” in the late ’90s—that is, the group of young men running around Hollywood back then, as coined by New York magazine—who seemed perfectly suited to the gang. Kevin Connolly, who would later star in Entourage, and exhausting magician David Blaine were unofficial members, and yes: That makes sense. But DiCaprio’s participation is but a tidbit in the grand story of his celebrity. Now he’s the guy who won an Oscar for that bear movie instead of being the top-ranked Pussy Posse member.\n\nIn his romantic exploits, DiCaprio may have the most in common with Jack Nicholson than with any other male actor of the past 50 years. Notorious for being a Hollywood bachelor, Nicholson also spent most of his life single but in the company of much younger, very beautiful women, like Lara Flynn Boyle or this host of nameless, supine models on a boat in the south of France in 2009 when he was 72 years old. Publicly known as a very single, very horny old man, Nicholson got away with it by being insanely charismatic—go watch him in 2003’s Something’s Gotta Give and tell me you don’t want to fuck him, you coward!!!—but also by refusing to answer any questions about it.\n\nWhat also helps re-create his mythos is that DiCaprio too eschews most press. The closest we get are a few weeks around the release of a new movie, but his interviews hew tightly to the topic at hand. More often than not, DiCaprio is busy highlighting his female co-stars, like he did in countless interviews with Lily Gladstone to promote Killers of the Flower Moon.\n\nAnd in that prestige, Leo stays safe, not just from too much incisive critique about his personal life, but from the degradation of his public brand, his public image, and his public perception as a real actor. He doesn’t do many domestic advertisements, save a few ads for luxury cars or Rolexes, or some old Japanese credit card spots. Any brands he associates himself with are highbrow enough that it boxes out the average consumer anyway. Meanwhile, you’ve never seen a DiCaprio tweet or Instagram post, a podcast series or a newsletter. He’s staunchly offline, and so we only hear from him through his work and a few errant tabloid stories.\n\nIt’s a tale as old as Hollywood glamour! He’s just having fun, and who does it hurt if we have fun with him?\n\nIn 2016, DiCaprio talked about climate change during his Oscars acceptance speech: “Climate change is real,” he said. “It is the most urgent threat facing our entire species, and we need to work collectively together and stop procrastinating.” DiCaprio has spent much of his adult career lending his name to environmental missions, like in the late ’90s when he founded the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation. (The organization continues to be referenced by other climate groups, but it’s unclear what it does exactly.) What DiCaprio mostly employs is his star power, to bring attention to droughts or deforestation. Within the confines of the attention economy, he often uses the keen interest in him well. Remember when Ryan Gosling went to the 2005 MTV Movie Awards in a T-shirt that just said “DARFUR”? That move was, spiritually, all Leo.\n\nBut nearly 10 years after DiCaprio made that speech at the Oscars, his record in climate activism would take a public and obvious hit. Earlier this year, he was seen covering his face with his omnipresent black baseball cap on his way to the opulent, wasteful, and disruptive wedding of the third-richest man in the world. Few are taking their daily cues on climate change from famous actors, but it certainly reeked of a particular kind of hypocrisy.\n\nPlenty of celebrities were criticized for attending Jeff Bezos’ wedding to Lauren Sánchez, not least because Bezos had been so instrumental in Donald Trump’s reelection. The wedding was a vivid display of an oligarch’s climate selfishness; Bezos has long considered himself a climate activist, too, while also causing direct harm to the environment. In 2023, Bezos and DiCaprio entered the Protecting Our Planet Challenge, wherein a $200 million donation in partnership with the Brazilian government was earmarked to help achieve zero deforestation in the Amazon. It certainly didn’t seem to work: The next year, a University of Maryland study said 2024 was the worst year for deforestation around the world thus far. Meanwhile, transportation pollution wrought by Bezos’ Amazon has surged.\n\nStill, it wasn’t DiCaprio who received the lion’s share of criticism for joining Bezos on his wedding blitz, even as he’s put both his money and his mouth on the line for climate change reform. Instead, it was mostly women: Oprah, Gayle King, Katy Perry, the Kardashians. Female celebrity is oft held to account more than the men are, but somehow, DiCaprio’s glaring hypocrisy was hardly considered. Why would Kim Kardashian owe us more moral clarity around Bezos’ brand of brutalizing capitalism than the guy who invested in two different cell-based meat companies?\n\nDiCaprio was similarly Teflon-like when he got wrapped up in the investigation around Malaysian billionaire (and now, fugitive) Jho Low. In the spring of 2023, DiCaprio testified that Low had plans to donate millions of dollars to Obama’s 2012 campaign—which is, of course, very illegal for a foreign entity to do. But Low threw his money around DiCaprio in a few ways, including toward his charitable organizations, and in helping fund The Wolf of Wall Street. One New Year’s Eve, Low flew DiCaprio and a group of others between Australia and Las Vegas so he could celebrate two new years in one night.\n\nBut DiCaprio’s involvement with a billionaire’s scam didn’t mar much of his reputation. Frankly, none of his personal life choices or charity work or famous friends have changed his box-office bankability or his likeability.\n\nIt remains to be seen if DiCaprio’s latest venture will turn viewers off. DiCaprio currently has a 10 percent stake in a new “eco-hotel” being built near Tel Aviv. The 365-room hotel includes commercial spaces, restaurants, and a yacht marina accessible directly through the hotel. How eco-friendly could a 14-story hotel be? Well, it’s being “designed” for “sustainability,” and in 2018 DiCaprio said the project would “serve as a model for environmentally friendly hotel development for the entire world.” But clear climate concerns aside, how eco-friendly can anything be if it’s built on occupied land?\n\nPut aside the actual acting for a minute, and DiCaprio is almost a parody of a famous actor. He courts attention but only in the ways he wants: charity work on a topic almost everyone can agree on (trees = good), but not in a way that impacts his personal relationships with billionaires. He seeks privacy in his dating life while also maintaining a pretty mundanely common one: He’s a man in his 50s who likes young, pretty women. This public performance of morality twined with a greasy romantic history might make DiCaprio feel unwholesome, but the work is so good that it obfuscates any queasiness an audience may have. Maybe his choice of roles is intentional in that way—he can live however he wants so long as the work is superior, and so long as discussion of that work is more interesting than discussion of his personal choices.\n\nBut it’s not that Leo didn’t want to be a famous actor, like people said about him when he was in his early 20s and just taking off as the star of Titanic. He did, because the only way to get Gen X–famous was to really want it, and to court it. He just plays the game of aloof artist perfectly, and in a way that no contemporary actor can quite achieve. Guys like Glen Powell or Austin Butler can’t engage audiences by being unknowable the way DiCaprio is, or by avoiding the gaze of the internet. What works for him is the kind of thing that works against a younger actor: distance, disinterest, and disengagement.\n\nIn 2015, Martin Scorsese directed a 15-minute-long short film as an ad for the Studio City Macau Resort, featuring DiCaprio along with Brad Pitt and Robert De Niro. DiCaprio and De Niro play slightly less interesting versions of themselves both auditioning for the same role in Manila. De Niro, an established member of the nouveau Rat Pack of the ’70s and ’80s, is quarrelling with the younger but still spiritually similar DiCaprio: two blowhard actors loudly trying to impress a director who came of age during Hitchcock’s prime.\n\nBut it’s not a regular ad, is it? It’s a Scorsese ad. A Scorsese film. And even though it’s just an advertisement for some hotel, it somehow feels different. It’s more prestigious. Here’s DiCaprio again, selling you something you don’t need, and likely can’t afford. Somehow, you don’t mind hearing the pitch.","summary":"Why do we love this modelizing Oscar winner so much?","url":"https://slate.com/life/2025/09/leonardo-dicaprio-one-battle-after-another-movie-jeff-bezos-girlfriend.html?via=rss","image":"https://compote.slate.com/images/08fc6a67-30d3-48ac-acee-3a08606e6c60.jpeg?crop=1560%2C1040%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-25 09:40:00","author":"Scaachi Koul","authors":["Scaachi Koul"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.245},{"id":363385958,"title":"Saree goals?

John McCain, rails against ‘nepo baby’ Violet Affleck after UN speech","text":"Social media users have slammed Meghan McCain for branding Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner’s daughter, Violet, as a “nepo baby.” \n\nMcCain, the daughter of late 2008 Republican presidential candidate John McCain, commented in reference to Affleck’s speech at the United Nations.\n\n\"Every single thing about all of this is why people hate nepo babies so much,\" McCain wrote before taking the post down minutes later. \n\nHowever, some social media users were quick to point out the irony in McCain’s since-deleted post. \n\nIn the formerThe View co-host’s bio on X, she describes herself as a “nepo baby”. \n\n“Is that the Meghan McCain who, on a daily basis, reminds people that Senator McCain is her dad,” one user wrote.\n\n“Meghan McCain saying anything about Nepo Babies as if she isn’t the Boss Nepo Baby is wild,” another said. \n\nMcCain’s post had been in response to a speech made by Violet Affleck at the UN, where Affleck had advocated for greater awareness of the “long Covid crisis” and for the importance of clean air. \n\n“We can create clean air infrastructure that is so ubiquitous and so obviously necessary, tomorrow’s children don’t even know why we need it,” she said.\n\nHowever, McCain said that Affleck had “no business” speaking at the UN and described her speech as “patently absurd”.\n\nMcCain, author of the children’s book My Dad, John McCain, is best known for appearing on The View, where she regularly clashed with her more liberal co-hosts.\n\nShe later went viral in 2024 when she admitted to voting for her own late father in the presidential election. \n\n\"I wrote in my dad,\" she said on the Katie Couric podcast. \n\n\"Is that cliché?” McCain added.\n\nThe former host went on to say that she could “never” vote for Trump, since she felt that she could “never explain” casting her ballot for him to her children. \n\nShe also said that she did not vote for Kamala Harris because Harris’s running mate, Tim Walz, “scared” her as a “pro-life, pretty hardcore conservative” voter. \n\nMinnesota has some of the most progressive abortion laws in the United States, with Governor Walz signing a law that bans the arrest of doctors providing abortions in the state. \n\nMinnesota became the first state to pass a law protecting abortion rights after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. \n\nThe law stated that local governments cannot control a person’s choice to obtain an abortion. \n\nThe Independent has approached The McCain Institute and Meghan McCain for comment.","summary":"McCain worked on her father’s campaign to win the Republican presidential nomination in 2008","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/meghan-mccain-violet-affleck-nepo-baby-b2833391.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/07/01/21/GettyImages-1485576612.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/1cEX5P9C-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-25 09:19:16","author":"Owen Scott","authors":["Owen Scott"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.108},{"id":363385972,"title":"Festive charm meets elegance — Sreeleela stuns in her latest look","text":"Festive charm meets elegance — Sreeleela stuns in ...\n\nSaree goals?

She was pressed on why she thought she didn't win and on a key interview she did in 2024 where she failed to differentiate herself from former President Joe Biden. \"Harris’ recent media tour to tout her memoir — ‘107 Days’ — has reminded me of something I think I have long known: She is simply not a very good politician. And she hasn’t gotten much better over her decades in the business,\" former CNN journalist Chris Cillizza wrote in his Substack. KAMALA HARRIS AIDE URGED 'THE VIEW' HOSTS TO ASK AGAIN AFTER VP FLUBBED QUESTION ON DIFFERENCES WITH BIDEN In a post to X, Cillizza said Harris’ return to the political world reminded him that she’s not good on her feet, adding, \"She speaks in word salads.\" KAMALA HARRIS' NOD TO PETE BUTTIGIEG TEES UP POTENTIAL 2028 RUN: DNC VICE CHAIR CNN's Kasie Hunt and former Democratic Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel discussed Harris' admission on \"The View\" that she didn't fully appreciate voters wanted to see a difference between her and Biden. \"Didn‘t fully appreciate how much of an issue it was? Just the entire ballgame,\" Hunt said Tuesday, asking Emanuel to react. Emanuel said all great presidents have a deep appreciation for politics. \"To not appreciate that question, given that the people thought at that time that the country was headed — 70% thought it was headed in the wrong direction, they wanted to see a change — is to totally misread where the American people were. And that, I‘m a little shocked at, to be honest,\" he said. Harris told the co-hosts of \"The View\" she lost to President Donald Trump because she didn't have enough time. KAMALA HARRIS COMPLAINS ABOUT 'IMPOSSIBLE' LACK OF SUPPORT FROM BIDEN'S COMMS TEAM, INNER CIRCLE Emanuel also called out Harris for her reasoning in not picking Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg as her running mate. The former vice president wrote that Buttigieg was too big of a \"risk\" as a gay man. \"We were already asking a lot of America: to accept a woman, a Black woman, a Black woman married to a Jewish man. Part of me wanted to say, ‘Screw it, let’s just do it.’ But knowing what was at stake, it was too big of a risk,\" she wrote. \"And I think Pete also knew that — to our mutual sadness.\" Maddow told Harris her rationale for not picking Buttigieg was \"hard to hear,\" forcing Harris to scramble to explain herself to the MSNBC audience. One Democratic strategist told The Hill that Harris' book couldn't have come at a worse time. KAMALA HARRIS BREAKS SILENCE ON BIDEN DROPOUT, ADMITS SHE HAS REGRETS ABOUT HER HANDLING OF SITUATION Gary South, a California Democratic strategist, told the outlet that excerpts of the book \"show pretty clearly that she came out with arms flailing and guns blazing, blaming everyone but herself for her loss.\" \"It is a curiously negative and ungracious tome for someone who reportedly thinks she can run again in 2028,\" he added. CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE \"In an era where Democrats need all hands on deck in the fight to protect the country and the Constitution from the lawlessness of the Trump administration, she had a real opportunity to be a critical voice in the resistance,\" Michael Hardaway, a former senior advisor to House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., told Politico. \"This book seems to be unhelpful and divisive in a way that makes it hard for her to be the face of the party as we look to the future.\" Former Obama advisor David Axelrod criticized the book last week in a statement to Politico. \"If there’s a political strategy here, it’s a bad one. There’s an awful lot of grievances and finger-pointing that really doesn’t serve a political agenda,\" he said.
