Kathy Hochul is filling the upper echelons of her re-election team with alumni of campaigns in battleground states and other recent high-stakes political fights – a signal she may be expecting a tough race even in deep-blue New York.\n\nThe governor has taken former staffers from high-profile statewide races in battlegrounds such as Michigan, Georgia and Wisconsin, as well as some advisers from her gubernatorial run atop the ticket in 2022.\n\nHochul’s campaign manager, Preston Elliott, ran Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s 2022 re-election campaign and had a recent stint at the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, or DSCC, the Democrats’ campaign arm managing independent spending in Senate races.\n\nElliott’s deputy, as reported by POLITICO Friday, will be Lexie Kelly, previously finance director on Minnesota Sen. Tammy Baldwin’s campaign.\n\nHochul’s comms team is headed by Sarafina Chitika, who worked on Georgia Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock’s (D-Ga.) campaign before Vice President Kamala Harris’s presidential bid. \n\nRyan Radulovacki, just off incoming New Jersey Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill’s race, will be the Hochul campaign’s press secretary.\n\n“Democrats have made New York one of the most unaffordable states in America, and everyone knows that,” said Bill O’Reilly, a GOP consultant told The Post. “It’s an axiom. No wonder the governor is beginning to freak out about the race.”\n\nJack O’Donnell, a Democratic consultant whose raised money for Hochul, said, “You can see from this battle-tested team that she’s ready for a fight, and I suspect when her campaign files their fundraising numbers next month, you will see she’s quite well-prepared for the fight, too.”\n\nHochul’s campaign is retaining some older hands from her rocky 2022 bid, too, including Stacey Lynch, a progressive ex-New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio aide who left her position in Hochul’s government office as chief of staff to join her campaign this summer as a senior adviser.\n\nThe gov is also keeping on Abigail Erwin, the architect of her highly effective fundraising apparatus, as a senior adviser, according to POLITICO.\n\nNorth Country Rep. Elise Stefanik, Hochul’s main GOP foe at this point, said the governor’s record means more than her staff picks.\n\n“The Worst Governor in America Kathy Hochul is clearly in campaign free fall as New Yorkers know she has driven our state off a cliff as the most unaffordable state in the nation and the most unsafe,” Stefanik wrote in a statement to The Post.","summary":"The governor has taken former staffers from high-profile statewide races in battlegrounds such as Michigan, Georgia and Wisconsin, as well as some advisers from her gubernatorial run atop the ticket in 2022.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/12/05/us-news/hochul-beefs-up-campaign-staff-in-sign-of-looming-gop-threat/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/116812700.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/rFFaNCOA-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-12-05 23:42:26","author":"Vaughn Golden","authors":["Vaughn Golden"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.165},{"id":385483214,"title":"Trump’s new national-security plan beats Biden’s but muddles our biggest threats","text":"The White House’s just-released National Security Strategy wisely jettisons the Biden administration’s misguided emphasis on sexual identity and climate change as security priorities, but what emerges in its replacement is a mixed bag.\n\nIts combination of muddled rhetoric and limited ambition, for starters, will keep America’s allies jittery about our plans, as rivals like Beijing and Moscow probe for weaknesses.\n\nThe best National Security Strategies accurately describe the world as it is, align finite national resources to potentially unlimited aims and, most important, inform decision-making in a crisis.\n\nThe Trump 1.0 strategy largely accomplished all three of these objectives, declaring in no uncertain terms that China and Russia were overt challengers to American power and influence. The Trump 2.0 strategy is less clear.\n\nInstead of decisive language and a bold recognition of immediate dangers from China, Russia or the clerical regime in Iran, the new strategy buries Trump’s priorities under layers of befuddling rhetoric.\n\nWhat does it mean that America’s foreign policy is “pragmatic without being ‘pragmatist,’” or “realistic without being ‘realist’?”\n\nLanguage like this reads more like Kamala Harris’ word salads than Trump’s signature plain talk. Worse, these vagaries will not be useful when the chips are down.\n\nIf a terrorist hijacked an American airliner, is it pragmatic or pragmatist to shoot it down? If Russian special forces make a limited incursion into the Baltic States, is it realistic or realist to defend our allies?\n\nAnd what does it all mean in operational terms? Emergencies will require immediate answers the NSS doesn’t provide.\n\nOne area where the new strategy shines is its honest recognition of America’s finite resources and the nearly unlimited international problems the administration is asked to address.\n\nPrevious strategies ignored this fact. They opted instead for laundry lists of wishes or desired end states.\n\nA useful strategy should set clear priorities, as the new plan itself notes upfront.\n\nWhat, then, should be at the top of Trump 2.0’s list?\n\nRight now, China is flexing its military muscle in the Pacific, ramming ships and wargaming threats to Taiwan.\n\nNATO generals warn that Russia could be ready to attack Europe in under five years.\n\nThe clerics in Tehran are still in power and overtly antagonistic to America and its friends.\n\nAlas, the Trump 2.0 strategy gives these issues lower priority, focusing more on Western Hemisphere affairs, fair trade deals and grievances about current account deficits.\n\nThese are all important, but not nearly as much as the enormous, overt dangers from nuclear-armed opponents.\n\nThe United States cannot win a high-stakes rivalry with serious players like Beijing or Moscow if we don’t adequately confront the severity of our competition and the complexity of the threats they present.\n\nTake Taiwan: The new strategy rightly asserts that “deterring a conflict over Taiwan, ideally by preserving military overmatch, is a priority.”\n\nIt adds that “American military cannot, and should not have to, do this alone.” The same could be said for our military posture in the European theater.\n\nHowever, the speed at which the Trump 2.0 strategy seeks to shift the burden onto the shoulders of allies could be too fast for them to keep up.\n\nGaps in our deterrent power will be the predictable result if we don’t account for the real-world limitations of our allies to mobilize their defense production, recruit soldiers and pick up the slack.\n\nInjecting a healthy spirit of patriotism into American foreign policy, rejecting the expansive aims of unrestrained globalism and recognizing the limits of US resource constraints are all welcomed and needed additions by the new NSS.\n\nThe danger, however, is that the new strategy provides an excuse not to act decisively and with a clear purpose when opponents test our limits or allies call on us to honor our covenants and treaties.\n\nEnsuring our freedom in the world and the prosperity that Americans have come to expect will require both.\n\nPresident Trump has said: “My priority is to end conflicts, not to start them, but I will never hesitate to wield American power, if it’s necessary, to defend the United States of America or our partners.”\n\nLet’s hope the president’s national-security team remembers this when the next crisis breaks.\n\nIt could be more useful than their unwieldly NSS.\n\nPeter Doran is an adjunct senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a nonpartisan research institute focused on national security and foreign policy.","summary":"The White House’s just-released National Security Strategy wisely jettisons the Biden administration’s misguided emphasis on sexual identity and climate change as security priorities, but what emerges in its replacement is a mixed bag.

Tim Walz. The illegal alien, Abdul Dahir Ibrahim, from Somalia, has had a deportation order against him since 2004 and courts have rejected all of his appeals. Ibrahim has a criminal history that includes convictions in Canada for asylum and welfare fraud before he entered the United States, according to a Department of Justice document reviewed by Fox News Digital. On January 23, 2002, Ibrahim was also convicted in the Dakota County District Court for providing false information to police and driving without a valid license. He was fined and sentenced to one year's probation. Ibrahim has also received 12 traffic or parking citations in the U.S. Ibrahim is unmarried but at one point claimed that his sister was his wife and her children were theirs, which was later found to be fictitious, according to the document. ICE OPERATION IN MINNEAPOLIS NABS A DOZEN 'WORST OF THE WORST' CRIMINAL ILLEGAL ALIENS, INCLUDING SOMALIS Per ICE, Ibrahim entered the United States in 1995, in New York, following deportation from Canada. On April 3, 2004, an immigration judge ordered Ibrahim removed. In the decision, the judge highlighted the significant amount of fraud associated with him. His appeals were denied, and in 2006, a circuit court upheld the immigration court’s decision. Despite this, Ibrahim was granted Temporary Protective Status (TPS) for approximately 10 years. He has a pending TPS application that has still not been adjudicated since 2023. Ibrahim has been photographed with several high-profile politicians in Minnesota, including Walz, Squad member Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., Minneapolis Democratic City Council Member Jamal Osman and state Sen. Omar Fateh, who was unsuccessful in his recent Minneapolis mayoral race. He has been photographed with Walz on at least two different occasions. Osman and Fateh both wrote letters of recommendation on behalf of Ibrahim during his immigration proceedings. DOJ LAWSUIT CLAIMS MINNESOTA SANCTUARY POLICIES ALLOW 'DANGEROUS CRIMINALS' TO AVOID REMOVAL President Donald Trump has recently announced a flurry of new actions to crack down and investigate fraud schemes in Minnesota, which he has assailed as a \"hub of money laundering activity,\" and cited as the basis of his decision to terminate deportation protections for hundreds of Somali migrants. Senior Trump administration officials announced fresh investigations this week, including a new Treasury Department probe into how taxpayer dollars were allegedly diverted to the terrorist organization al-Shabaab, according to Secretary Scott Bessent. Last month, Trump cited the fraud as a driver of his decision to terminate the Temporary Protected Status designation for thousands of Somali migrants living in Minnesota, saying in a Truth Social post that they should \"go back to where they came from.\" FEDERAL PROBE TARGETS ALLEGED MINNESOTA SOMALI FRAUD ‘NETWORK’ AS COVID-AID CRIME RINGS PERSIST Meanwhile, city officials in Minneapolis are bracing for an influx of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents after the agency announced plans for a new operation in the state.

Gavin Newsom kept a low profile as he swung through the nation's capital this week, holding meetings with a handful of lawmakers Friday on Capitol Hill as he renewed calls for billions in federal recovery aid following the Los Angeles fires. For a governor who has spent recent weeks in the spotlight — trailed by cameras at the U.N. climate summit in Brazil last month and featured at the New York Times’ DealBook Summit on Wednesday — the muted Washington stop stood out. As he moved between offices on Friday, the halls were quiet, with many lawmakers already en route home for the weekend. The governor's office disclosed little before his trip about Newsom's schedule in Washington, saying afterward that he met with five lawmakers, including three who serve on the Senate and House committees on Appropriations, as well as Sen. Alex Padilla (D-Los Angeles) and Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks). Newsom told The Times that the Federal Emergency Management Agency denied his request for a meeting, a setback that underscored the political friction with the Trump administration surrounding California’s $33.9-billion appeal for long-term disaster funding nearly a year after the devastating Los Angeles fires ignited. The governor said his visit was meant to make \"the universal case for support for recovery,\" not just for California, but for other states that were hit with disasters, such as Texas and North Carolina. \"We're getting to the point where we need to see action, and so that's why we're stepping up our efforts,\" Newsom said as he left a meeting with Sen. John Boozman (R-Ark.), a tenured member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. Newsom noted that the funding is vital for fire victims. \"They should not be revictimized through politics, or by politics or politicians,\" Newsom said. \"There's nothing more American than being there for people in need. That's foundational.\" Newsom did not say whether he attempted to request a meeting with the White House when asked by a reporter. The White House did not respond to a request seeking comment. When asked if he thought his discussions with lawmakers had been successful, Newsom said he was glad to have been able to meet with \"folks on the other side of the aisle,\" and he characterized the meetings as an example of \"remarkable graciousness.\" Newsom's office said the governor also met with Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) and Rep. Adriano Espaillat (D-New York). Newsom is urging the Trump administration to send Congress a formal request for $33.9 billion in recovery aid needed to rebuild homes, schools, utilities and other critical infrastructure destroyed or damaged when the fires tore through neighborhoods beginning Jan. 7. The governor said there is bipartisan support in Congress for long-term aid. But, he said, the Trump administration has not advanced any recovery proposal since his initial request was filed in February. That request was for nearly $40 billion, but has since been decreased by what has already been paid out, according to a letter Newsom sent to Congressional leaders Wednesday. “Back in January, the President looked me in the eye on the tarmac at LAX and promised me, and the people of LA, that he’d 'take care of it' as we rebuild and recover,\" Newsom said in a statement Thursday. \"That commitment isn’t being met, and instead he’s leaving survivors behind. It’s time for Trump to wake up and do his job.” The fires burned thousands of structures across Los Angeles, displacing families and uprooting businesses. In the first six months after the fires, California received reimbursement for direct response costs and more than $3 billion in individual assistance and small-business loans. The governor's visit to Washington comes as Republicans in the House and Senate have launched two congressional inquiries into California officials' response to the Palisades fire and how organizations have distributed disaster relief funds to victims. As part of the congressional inquiries, lawmakers have requested a trove of records from dozens of agencies at the local, state and federal level. Newsom has welcomed the congressional scrutiny, saying his administration has \"embraced transparency because Californians deserve nothing else.\" Newsom has kept a low profile since news broke that his former chief of staff Dana Williamson was arrested on federal corruption charges. Newsom has not spoken publicly about the indictment, besides an interview with the Sacramento Bee, where he described his reaction to the indictment as \"real surprise and shock.\" The governor told the Bee how Williamson was placed on leave last November when she informed his office of the federal investigation. He said he \"wasn't privy to the details\" and that his hope was that \"it would be worked out.\" Asked by The Times on Friday during a three-minute interview whether he knew anything about the ongoing investigation, Newsom said, \"I really don't.\" Newsom also said he has not been interviewed by the Department of Justice regarding the investigation. Newsom has not been accused of wrongdoing. Williamson’s attorney McGregor Scott, a former U.S. attorney in Sacramento, told The Times in November that federal authorities had approached Williamson more than a year ago seeking help with some kind of investigation of the governor himself. Newsom was a featured speaker Wednesday at the New York Times' DealBook Summit, where he dodged questions about whether he will run for president in 2028, but was not asked about the indictment that has reverberated through Sacramento political circles. Asked during the DealBook event about where the Democrats went wrong in the last presidential election, Newsom reiterated harsh criticism of his party. \"The party's knitting itself back together,\" Newsom said at the event. \"We got shellacked in the last election, and there's been a lot of forensic analysis, perhaps not enough, about what happened. Donald Trump crushed us in the last election.\" Newsom added that the issues with the Democratic party go beyond what went wrong with the passing of the baton between Biden and Kamala Harris. \"We have to be more culturally normal,\" Newsom said. \"We have to be a little less judgmental. We have a party that, I think, needs to design and develop a compelling economic vision for the future where people feel included, to reconcile the fact that if we don't democratize our economy, we're not going to save democracy.\"","summary":"Gov.

Consider this: suspect Brian Cole, Jr., is alive and probably talking, unlike, say, Jeffrey Epstein and Thomas Matthew Crooks in other matters of public interest. Let’s hope he is under FBI protection in custody, lest something. . . say. . . happen to him.\n\nDressed for government work?\n\nAs of early this morning, the country knows next to nothing else about Cole and what he was up to the night of Jan. 5, 2021.\n\nThe FBI has not even said how he is employed. But his photo shows a young man dressed for office work. . . he lives in a nice house in the DC suburbs of Virginia. . .and you might infer that he is, possibly, a federal government worker. Oh, and the FBI was unable to catch him through the whole four years of “Joe Biden?”\n\nYou can suppose at this point that the story of that four-year botched investigation will be a way bigger thing than the pipe bomber’s little prank itself.\n\nIt probably leads to the story of wholesale corruption in Christopher Wray’s FBI, and even more consequentially, to the realization that the so-called J6, 2021 “insurrection” was a government op from top to bottom, aimed at eradicating Trump and Trumpism.\n\nFirst, what was supposed to happen in a joint session of Congress that day?\n\nAnswer: certification of electoral college votes in the 2020 election. What else was liable to happen that day? Answer: under the Electoral Count Act of 1887 (3 U.S.C. §§ 5–6, 15–18) — as amended, and by the rules laid out in the U.S. Constitution (Article II and the 12th Amendment) — objections to several states’ slates of electors were expected to be entertained, triggering debate and possible rejection of those states’ electors on the basis that the votes were not “lawfully certified” (under 3 U.S.C. § 6), or not “regularly given” (meaning the vote was marred by fraud, corruption, or violence). Any state’s electoral votes could be rejected if both the House and Senate voted by simple majority, after up to two hours of separate debate.\n\nAt mid-day, objections meeting the written requirement (one House member + one Senator) were filed for Arizona and Pennsylvania. The objection to the Arizona vote (Rep. Paul Gosar + Sen. Ted Cruz) was the first scheduled to be debated shortly after 1:00 p.m. It was not allowed to happen. Instead, Congress evacuated the chamber. When Congress returned at 8:00 p.m., votes objecting to Arizona and Pennsylvania slates failed and no others were taken up. Senators who previously had committed to debating the votes of several other swing states demurred, citing the breach of demonstrators into the Capitol. The full tally concluded at 3:44 in the morning, Jan 7, “Joe Biden” and Kamala Harris were certified as winners of the 2020 election.\n\nHere are some things to know about the pipe bomb subplot in the J-6 story.\n\nKamala Harris, vice president-elect, still a sitting Senator (CA), was not in the chamber for the certification process. She arrived at the DNC headquarters some blocks away from the Capitol by motorcade at 11:30 a.m. and stayed until she was evacuated from the DNC at 1:14 p.m. Couple of questions about that? 1) did she not want to be present in the chamber at the momentous instant that her election as veep was certified? 2) Did she not have a duty to be present for voting on any of the procedure? Weird, a little bit. She has never explained what she was doing at the DNC that day.\n\nKamala Harris was in the DNC building when the pipe bomb was discovered there, around 1:07 p.m. The pipe bomb at the RNC had been discovered some 20 minutes prior, and it was the discovery of that bomb, at 12:44 p.m. that prompted the evacuation of the joint House / Senate session in Congress, not any breach of the Capitol building, which did not occur until 2:13, p.m., more than an hour later.\n\nNow, to the FBI response to all this. \n\nThey quickly collected tons of closed-circuit video of a suspect planting these pipe bombs. The footage they released showed the suspect at a one-frame-per-second recording rate which, as Mike Benz points out, is a hundred times slower than any common gas station closed circuit camera nowadays. The FBI also doctored the recordings, specifically blurring out the section of the suspect’s face at one angle captured by a CC camera about eight meters away. The rectangular blur patch over his eyes can be clearly seen. How’d that happen?\n\nThe FBI also managed to botch every other aspect of the investigation into the act that actually triggered the evacuation of Congress that day — which was (repeat) not the breach of the Capitol building but the pipe bombs. In the months afterward, FBI Director Wray took agents off the case. He had in place as chief of the FBI’s Washington office an assistant director named Steven D’Antuono who had been in charge previously, as Detroit field chief, of the Gretchen Whitmer kidnapping case in which at least 12 confidential informants and three FBI agents were involved in what looked like an entrapment scheme. D’Antuono had demonstrated considerable skill in constructing skeezy FBI ops when he was put in charge of the DC office. The agency managed to lose the chain-of-custody for much of the evidence in the case, including originals of the videos, cell phone records, communications records between Capitol police, DC metropolitan police, Secret Service, and the FBI, and more.\n\nSo, the pipe bomber has been a cold case lo these many years. And now we’re informed as of yesterday’s FBI / DOJ press conference, that the FBI under Director Patel cracked the case using only information and evidence already in the FBI files. So, get this: there must be a record of exactly which agents were on the pipe bomber case those four years under Christopher Wray. There must be a record of who, by name, was in charge of chains-of-custody for all that evidence. And there must be a record of the senior agents and deputy directors who oversaw all their activities, all the way up to Director Wray. Why would they not be subject to charges of obstruction of justice?\n\nAll of this is just the pipe bomber subplot of the J6 story. There remains the weird business with then House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her failure to request national guard protection at the US Capitol that day. And there remains the question of how many agents, assets, and confidential informants the FBI had in-place at the Capitol on J6, 2021, including Antifa members, and which actions, including the breach inside the building, they instigated. Then there is the question of the House J6 committee, how it was constructed with the help of lawfare ninja Norm Eisen, and how it deliberately destroyed all the evidence it collected over the months of its existence.\n\nBe prepared to learn how the J6 “insurrection” was a government-sponsored seditious conspiracy and then ponder who, by name, will be held responsible for it. That’s the tapestry that Brian Cole, Jr.’s little thread leads to.\n\nShout out to Mike Benz for his nearly four-hour discussion about the pipe bomber case on “X”.","url":"https://www.zerohedge.com/political/was-j6-insurrection-government-sponsored-seditious-conspiracy","image":"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/16_9_max_700/public/2025-12/httpssubstack-post-media.s3.amaz%20%287%29.jpg?h=ad60de56&amp;itok=q4QUnNu6","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-05 21:20:00","author":"Tyler Durden","authors":["Tyler Durden"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.168},{"id":385460302,"title":"These voters backed Trump in 2024 and Democrats in 2025. What will they do in 2026?","text":"Voters who backed Democratic governors in New Jersey and Virginia this year after voting for President Donald Trump in 2024 have a message for both parties: reject your party’s extremes and run campaigns about more than just Trump. In new focus groups, 14 swing voters from New Jersey and Virginia revealed sharply negative views of both parties — and of politicians broadly. They explained that they were drawn in last month's elections in their states to Govs.-elect Mikie Sherrill and Abigail Spanberger, who cast themselves as moderates and transcended the damaged Democratic Party brand. And while 10 of these voters disapproved of Trump’s job performance so far and voiced concerns about high prices, a majority said they did not view their votes for governor as a protest vote against Trump. An anti-Trump message alone may not be enough to sway them and voters like them next year in the midterm elections. Instead, their consistent refrain serves as an important message to Republicans and Democrats as they look to sway swing voters in key races across the country next year: Candidate quality matters, ranging from positions on issues to personality to professional background. “I mean, look, I’m a Republican, but let me tell you, if somebody is checking all the boxes for me, if they’re a Democrat, I’m going to go with my gut and what I feel,” Cynthia G., a 52-year-old from New Jersey, said of Sherrill, who served in Congress before she won the governorship. “And Mikie is just proven to me. Naval officer, formal federal prosecutor, mother of four. She’s tough, but she’s like the quiet storm. She’ll get things done,” said Cynthia, who participated in the recent focus groups, which were produced by Syracuse University and the research firms Engagious and Sago and observed by NBC News as part of the 2025 “Deciders” series. Exit polling from the New Jersey and Virginia gubernatorial races show Sherrill and Spanberger, another former House member, both had some crossover appeal as they sailed to double-digit victories, each winning 7% of voters who cast ballots for Trump in 2024. Unlike a poll, which uses statistical methods to demonstrate the views of a larger population, focus groups dig deeper into how individual panelists view key questions facing the country and make decisions. These focus groups shed light on why some voters backed Democrats despite sharply negative views of the Democratic Party and illustrated nuanced views of Trump and how he now factors into their political thinking. “The most important lesson for both parties in 2026 is to not run flawed candidates,\" said Rich Thau, president of Engagious. \"While affordability, political moderation, and President Trump’s job performance all mattered in Virginia’s and New Jersey’s gubernatorial races, what mattered most to swing voters was candidate quality.\" Candidates matter These voters — including 12 self-described independents, one Republican and one Democrat — said they supported Trump in 2024 because they were optimistic he could better handle the economy. They also viewed then-Vice President Kamala Harris as unqualified and out of touch. And while these voters view both parties negatively, they were especially critical of the Democratic Party, describing Democrats when asked to offer a brief assessment as “dishonest,” “weak,” “unfocused,” “self-serving,” “wishy-washy, and “ineffective.” But Sherrill and Spanberger, a former CIA officer, were still able to win them over by casting themselves as pragmatic moderates and stressing their national security backgrounds. Spanberger “was the closest thing to what you can call a moderate nowadays. She worked across the aisle. She wasn’t an extremist,” said Bruce L., 40, of Richmond, who noted that her congressional office also helped resolve issues for him and his family. Michael C., 60, of Brick, N.J., said he backed Sherrill “because of her veteran status. Because being in the military, when you have a job that needs to get done, you get it done, you make sure you find a way to do it.” Other voters described Sherrill and Spanberger as “sensible,” “pragmatic” and “down-to-earth.” None said they backed the Democrats solely because they would oppose Trump’s policies. “It’s easy to see these Democratic wins in Virginia and New Jersey as a referendum on President Trump, but what these swing voters told us is not quite that simple,\" said Margaret Talev, director of Syracuse University’s Institute for Democracy, Journalism & Citizenship. \"Moderation, competency and personal appeal is the combination they crave.\" Some voters were turned off by the GOP candidates’ embrace of Trump, even though these voters supported him last year. The president endorsed Jack Ciattarelli, a former state legislator, against Sherrill in New Jersey. And while Trump did not back Virginia Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, she broadly embraced his policies. “Winsome Earle-Sears just seemed to be an extremist who actually just kept defining herself in comparison to others than rather what she stood for, and would propagate the worst of the Trump policies,” said Robert L., a 54-year-old from Springfield, Virginia. Christian G., 25, of Clifton, New Jersey, described Ciattarelli as a “phony” who was “piggybacking off of Trump a lot, or just utilizing Trump’s name in general.” All but one of the New Jersey voters said their state has been going in the “wrong direction,” but they still voted for a Democrat after two terms of Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy. Some saw Ciattarelli as part of the same “good old boys’ network” as Murphy. They viewed Sherrill as the candidate more likely to bring a change and were drawn to her proposals to lower the state’s rising utility bills. Meanwhile, nine of the 14 focus group participants said their votes for Sherrill and Spanberger were not about protesting Trump. But the five voters who did view their votes as a protest against Trump voiced a wide range of concerns with his administration so far. “Trump made a lot of promises, but most of them could not be delivered,” said Rebecca H., 52, of Falls Church, Virginia. “For me, it’s kind of a testament to how I guess trust was lost over the year,” said Christian, the Clifton, New Jersey, resident. “Whereas I voted for him back in ‘24, now, a year later I’m feeling let down.” Down on Trump The former Trump voters have some significant disagreements with the president — including over health care, his immigration policies, the Defense Department’s attacks on suspected drug boats from South America, and the handling of documents related to the federal investigation into Jeffrey Epstein. But the economy loomed especially large. Some, like Cynthia G., the 52-year-old New Jersey Republican, believe that the economy is moving “in the right direction, to a degree.” She’s been heartened by seeing prices for goods like eggs going down, even though most of the groups said they’ve seen significant price increases broadly. Others who feel the country is now more stable economically cited their view of Trump as a businessman with a plan or the strength of the stock market. And some see Trump’s aggressive tariff policy as an important way to eventually bring jobs back from overseas. “I agree with the tariffs. I think, honestly, I wish it would force all manufacturing to come back to the United States,” said Ashley E., a 40-year-old Virginia independent. But other participants were fiercely critical of Trump’s handling of the economy, particularly tariffs. “People tried warning him before the elections that the foreign companies don’t pay them [tariffs], it’s reflected in the price. And he said, 'Oh, that’s not true,'” said Robert L., a 54-year-old Virginia independent. “If he’s such a great dealmaker, he should have used them [tariffs] as a potential stick,” Robert continued. “Instead, he’s a bull in a china shop and greatly impacted the economy and inflation. Presidents can affect inflation and the economy for the worse much more easily than for the better. And he’s done it for the worse.” Some grounded their frustration with Trump’s policies in what they saw as a general abdication of his campaign promise to lift up everyday Americans. “It’s a bait and switch with him where he said he was for the average person but he actually favors big business, and then just does whatever he wants and there’s no consequences,” said Justin K., a 39-year-old independent from Arlington, Virginia, who added that he thinks the “big tech companies” have Trump’s “ear.” In total, the group was largely down on Trump’s actions on immigration, with just two of the 14 respondents saying they approved, on the whole, of the administration’s policies. Some who had positive things to say about the administration clamping down on illegal border crossings were still deeply critical of its mass deportation policies and the widespread arrests being carried out by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. “He’s tightening the border control — I approve of that and I approve of restricting the refugees. But I don’t like how ICE is kidnapping people,” said Rebecca H., a 52-year-old independent from Virginia. On the U.S. military strikes ordered by Trump on alleged drug boats from Venezuela, or Trump accusing Democrats of “seditious behavior” for making a video calling on members of the military to refuse illegal orders, those who had heard about the episodes largely disagreed with the president. Only one participant backed using the military to strike suspected drug traffickers overseas, arguing America has a “right to defend ourselves from any country, or any person, who’s trying to bring in illicit substances that kill people.” The others criticized the administration for exceeding its authority. Meanwhile, fewer had heard about Trump’s clash with Democratic lawmakers over their social media video about illegal military orders. Some were skeptical about the Democrats' move in the first place. One voter called it a “great political stunt,” another said it was “insulting” to troops who already knew the rules, and another hesitated because “it’s going to make people start to question everything that’s going on.” But there was near unanimity in their belief that Trump’s response — posting social media messages labeling the lawmakers’ actions as “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH” — was not appropriate. “The last comment, punishable by death — I don’t think you should even go there, calling them traitors and everything like that,” Cynthia G., the 52-year-old New Jersey Republican, said. “He just has to word things a bit better.”","summary":"Voters who backed Democratic governors in New Jersey and Virginia this year after voting for President Donald Trump in 2024 have a message for both parties: reject your party’s extremes and run campaigns about more than just Trump","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/voters-backed-trump-2024-democrats-2025-will-2026-rcna246847","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251202-mikie-sherrill-donald-trump-abigail-spanberger-vl-417p-e6e408.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-05 21:00:42","author":"Ben Kamisar,Bridget Bowman","authors":["Ben Kamisar","Bridget Bowman"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.152},{"id":385458438,"title":"Connie Chung blasts ‘greedy’ CBS News owners, Bari Weiss as she claims network’s crashing ‘into crumbles’","text":"Veteran news anchor Connie Chung blasted CBS News and its new editor in chief Bari Weiss – saying she can’t even watch the network anymore as it undergoes a “crash into crumbles.”\n\nChung – who made waves at CBS News as the first Asian American and one of the first women to co-anchor a major network’s nightly newscast – took aim at Shari Redstone, who sold parent company Paramount to Skydance Media in an $8.4 billion deal in August.\n\n“CBS is a whole different organization than I had worked for,” Chung told Pablo Torre on an episode of his podcast, “Pablo Torre Finds Out.” “CBS has now been taken over, thanks to greedy owners, Shari Redstone partnering with David Ellison, Larry Ellison’s son.”\n\n“Their greed has caused the venerable CBS to actually disassemble, to crash into crumbles, and they’ve hired this – I don’t know what to call Bari Weiss,” Chung said, pausing to laugh. \n\nIn an attempt to bring balance to the network, Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison hired the pro-Israel, anti-woke Weiss in October. \n\nThe company also shelled out about $150 million to buy The Free Press, her buzzy, contrarian news site.\n\nWhen Torre asked Chung and her husband, Maury Povich, former host of the tabloid talk show “Maury,” what it’s like to watch CBS News today, she quickly replied: “We don’t.”\n\n“I mean, I can’t. The paradigm has completely changed in news and we have so much opinion that the truth doesn’t hold value anymore,” Chung continued.\n\n“What we end up doing is trying to – we, as consumers – is trying to find the truth.

And you don’t have to put this on, because I don’t wanna embarrass you,” the Republican commander-in-chief told O’Donnell.\n\nWhile the comments were not included in the original broadcast, O’Donnell mentioned the suit at the start of the episode and noted that CBS did not apologize as part of the settlement.","summary":"Chung – who made waves at CBS News as the first Asian American and one of the first women to co-anchor a major network’s nightly newscast – said she can't watch the network anymore.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/12/05/media/connie-chung-blasts-greedy-cbs-news-owners-bari-weiss-as-she-claims-network-has-undergone-crash/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/116797430.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/tdTZFJQq-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-12-05 20:42:43","author":"Taylor Herzlich","authors":["Taylor Herzlich"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.354},{"id":385441648,"title":"Dan Bongino On Past Pipe Bomb Conspiracy Theories: ‘I Was Paid For My Opinions’","text":"WASHINGTON – Dan Bongino, the deputy director of the FBI, admitted Thursday his past support for a Jan. 6 conspiracy theory was motivated by money. \n\nIn recent years, Bongino repeatedly said on his podcast that the pipe bombs discovered near the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, which did not explode, were some sort of “inside job,” the work of a government official out to get President Donald Trump and his supporters. \n\nOf the pipe bomber, Bongino said just this January: “This was an inside job. And it is the biggest scandal in FBI history.”\n\nIn an interview on Fox News this week, host Sean Hannity confronted Bongino about his past statements in light of Bongino’s FBI having finally identified a suspect in the case, a 30-year-old Virginia man with apparently no connection to the government. \n\n“Listen, I was paid in the past, Sean, for my opinions, that’s clear, and one day, I’ll be back in that space,” Bongino said. “But that’s not what I’m paid for now. I’m paid to be your deputy director, and we base investigations on facts.”\n\nIt was a stunning admission from a prominent voice in the right-wing media ecosystem — someone who held himself out as unafraid to tell truths the mainstream media and the government wanted to hide — that he wasn’t bothering to base any of it in fact. \n\nIt’s not the first time this year that Bongino and other prominent MAGA voices have walked back statements they made before becoming part of the second Trump administration. Earlier this year, the Justice Department announced that contrary to claims made by Bongino, FBI Director Kash Patel and Attorney General Pam Bondi in their pre-government roles, the government isn’t hiding a list of sex predator Jeffrey Epstein’s pedophile clients. But Bongino is the first one to come out and say he was just getting paid. \n\nBongino had claimed the pipe bomber wanted to help Democrats by disrupting Republican objections to the congressional certification of Joe Biden’s 2020 victory. The plan went awry, Bongino said, after a violent mob of Trump supporters disrupted the proceedings. But it was still the biggest scandal in history, he said, because the FBI knew the bomber’s identity and was protecting him.\n\n“It is a Democrat insider or an anti-Trump lunatic who was trying to stop on Jan. 6, four years ago, the Republicans from objecting to the election,” Bongino said on his podcast. “So they figured if they planted a bomb there that they could rush into the Capitol and go, ‘Stop the objections! Kamala Harris was almost killed by you!’”\n\nThe FBI now alleges the pipe bombs were left outside Democratic and Republican national committee headquarters buildings by Brian J. Cole Jr., a 30-year-old who reportedly told investigators he believed the 2020 election had been stolen from Trump. If that’s true, it’s possible he had the same motives as hundreds of Trump supporters who stormed the Capitol that day, namely that the 2020 election had been rigged in Biden’s favor. \n\nThe Blaze, a right-wing media site, retracted a November story that named a former Capitol Police officer as the pipe bomber based on “gait analysis.”\n\nOther proponents of pipe bomb conspiracy theories quickly adjusted to the news without admitting any error. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), who has said multiple federal agencies are implicated in the planting of the bombs, suggested the FBI’s failure to find Cole for five years is suspicious and that it would be “very suspect” if authorities claim Cole had no accomplices. The right-wing commentator Julie Kelly, a frequent guest on Bongino’s podcast, said it’s possible the FBI previously held off on arresting Cole because he’s Black. \n\nOn Friday morning, Bongino cheered himself by posting a quote from former President Theodore Roosevelt dismissing those criticizing from the sidelines. \n\n“The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena,” the quote goes, concluding that “if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.”","url":"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/dan-bongino-pipe-bomb-opinion-hannity_n_69332fe9e4b03cea5ab42fdd?origin=home-politics-feed-unit","image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/69333029190000086f7f365e.jpeg?ops=1778_1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-05 20:04:15","author":"Arthur Delaney","authors":["Arthur Delaney"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.592},{"id":385451682,"title":"Dan Bongino On Past Pipe Bomb Conspiracy Theories: ‘I Was Paid For My Opinions’","text":"WASHINGTON – Dan Bongino, the deputy director of the FBI, admitted Thursday his past support for a Jan. 6 conspiracy theory was motivated by money. \n\nIn recent years, Bongino repeatedly said on his podcast that the pipe bombs discovered near the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, which did not explode, were some sort of “inside job,” the work of a government official out to get President Donald Trump and his supporters. \n\nOf the pipe bomber, Bongino said just this January: “This was an inside job.

But it was still the biggest scandal in history, he said, because the FBI knew the bomber’s identity and was protecting him.\n\n“It is a Democrat insider or an anti-Trump lunatic who was trying to stop on Jan. 6, four years ago, the Republicans from objecting to the election,” Bongino said on his podcast. “So they figured if they planted a bomb there that they could rush into the Capitol and go, ‘Stop the objections! Kamala Harris was almost killed by you!’”\n\nThe FBI now alleges the pipe bombs were left outside Democratic and Republican national committee headquarters buildings by Brian J. Cole Jr., a 30-year-old who reportedly told investigators he believed the 2020 election had been stolen from Trump. If that’s true, it’s possible he had the same motives as hundreds of Trump supporters who stormed the Capitol that day, namely that the 2020 election had been rigged in Biden’s favor. \n\nThe Blaze, a right-wing media site, retracted a November story that named a former Capitol Police officer as the pipe bomber based on “gait analysis.”\n\nOther proponents of pipe bomb conspiracy theories quickly adjusted to the news without admitting any error. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), who has said multiple federal agencies are implicated in the planting of the bombs, suggested the FBI’s failure to find Cole for five years is suspicious and that it would be “very suspect” if authorities claim Cole had no accomplices. The right-wing commentator Julie Kelly, a frequent guest on Bongino’s podcast, said it’s possible the FBI previously held off on arresting Cole because he’s Black. \n\nOn Friday morning, Bongino cheered himself by posting a quote from former President Theodore Roosevelt dismissing those criticizing from the sidelines. \n\n“The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena,” the quote goes, concluding that “if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.”","url":"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/dan-bongino-pipe-bomb-opinion-hannity_n_69332fe9e4b03cea5ab42fdd?origin=home-latest-news-unit","image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/69333029190000086f7f365e.jpeg?ops=1778_1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-05 20:04:15","author":"Arthur Delaney","authors":["Arthur Delaney"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.592},{"id":385449692,"title":"Study: Persuasive AI Chatbots Could Play Major Role in Future Elections","text":"According to a recent study, researchers have discovered that AI chatbots can be more effective than traditional political advertisements in influencing voters’ opinions and preferences. AI chatbots that already display a consistent leftist bias could play a key role in the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nMIT Technology Review reports that a recent collaborative study conducted by researchers from multiple universities has revealed that AI chatbots possess a remarkable ability to sway voters’ political views, even surpassing the impact of conventional political advertisements. The findings, published in the prestigious journals Nature and Science, shed light on the potential of generative AI to reshape the landscape of elections in the near future.\n\nThe study involved over 2,300 participants who engaged in conversations with chatbots two months prior to the 2024 US presidential election. The AI models were trained to advocate for either of the top two candidates and demonstrated a surprising level of persuasiveness, particularly when discussing candidates’ policy platforms on crucial issues such as the economy and healthcare.\n\nThe results were striking: Donald Trump supporters who interacted with an AI model favoring Kamala Harris shifted 3.9 points toward supporting Harris on a 100-point scale, a shift approximately four times greater than the measured effect of political ads during the 2016 and 2020 elections. Similarly, the AI model championing Trump moved Harris supporters 2.3 points in his direction.\n\nExperiments conducted in the lead-up to the 2025 Canadian federal election and the 2025 Polish presidential election yielded even more pronounced effects, with chatbots shifting opposition voters’ attitudes by around 10 points.\n\nBreitbart News reported in 2024 on an academic study of the 24 most popular LLMs that demonstrated essentially of them showed leftist political views when tasked with taking political orientation tests:\n\nResults from the study revealed that all tested LLMs consistently produced answers that aligned with progressive, democratic, and environmentally conscious ideologies. The AI models frequently expressed values associated with equality, global perspectives, and “progress.”\nTo further investigate the phenomenon, Rozado conducted an additional experiment by fine-tuning GPT-3.5. He created two versions: LeftWingGPT, trained on content from left-leaning publications like the Atlantic and the New Yorker, and RightWingGPT, which was fine-tuned using material from right-leaning sources such as National Review and the American Conservative. The experiment demonstrated that RightWingGPT gravitated towards right-leaning regions in the political tests, suggesting that the political leanings of AI models can be influenced by the data used in their training.\n\nA separate study published in Science delved deeper into the factors contributing to the chatbots’ persuasiveness. Researchers deployed 19 large language models (LLMs) to interact with nearly 77,000 UK participants on over 700 political issues. They discovered that the most effective way to enhance the models’ persuasiveness was to instruct them to include facts and evidence in their arguments and provide additional training using examples of persuasive conversations. The most persuasive model shifted participants who initially disagreed with a political statement by an impressive 26.1 points toward agreeing.\n\nHowever, as the models became more persuasive, they increasingly provided misleading or false information, raising concerns about the potential consequences for democracy. Political campaigns employing AI chatbots could shape public opinion in ways that compromise voters’ ability to make independent political judgments.\n\nBreitbart News Social Media Director Wynton Hall, author of the upcoming book Code Red: The Left, the Right, China, and the Race to Control AI, underscores the importance of understanding how AI will be used to influence elections in the United States:\n\nWe’ve long known that LLMs are not neutral and overwhelmingly exhibit a left-leaning political bias. What this study confirms is that AI chatbots are also uniquely adept as political persuasion machines, and are willing to hallucinate misinformation if that’s what it takes to sway human minds. When you combine bias, AI hallucinations, and Ciceronian-style persuasiveness, that is clearly a wakeup call for conservatives heading into the midterm and presidential elections.\n\nRead more at MIT Technology Review here.\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.","summary":"According to a recent study, researchers have discovered that AI chatbots can be more effective than traditional political advertisements in influencing voters' opinions and preferences.

He bought them from Home Depot, Lowe's, Walmart and Micro Center.\n\nCole was seen on grainy surveillance video, but it was difficult to make out any characteristics, prolonging the investigation. The pipe bombs were made of 1-inch galvanized pipes, 8 inches long with end caps, homemade black powder, wires, metal clips and a kitchen timer.

Democrats said Russian collusion and meddling won the election for Trump and posed a grave threat to our democracy. But as we're fond of saying, it's (D)ifferent when Democrats do it.\n\nLast year, during the presidential election, members of the U.K. Labour Party came to the U.S. to campaign for Kamala Harris. Politico reported the Labour government was \"scared\" of the outcome of the election and feared Donald Trump would win a second term; when American voters objected to this interference, Prime Minister Keir Starmer said it was perfectly normal for Brits to \"volunteer\" to work on American Democratic Party presidential campaigns.\n\nBut the rot goes so much deeper than that. Starmer and his government actively worked to silence American conservatives, including Breitbart News and other outlets, during the 2020 election.\n\nDrop Site News reported on the story.\n\nDrop Site’s Ryan Grim joined Steve Bannon’s War Room to lay out how PM Keir Starmer’s chief aide Morgan McSweeney oversaw a project called “Stop Funding Fake News,” which sought to demonetize the U.S. conservative publication Breitbart and to kneecap any publication perceived to… pic.twitter.com/3yOt4s7t29— Drop Site (@DropSiteNews) December 4, 2025\n\nHere's more:\n\nAs Keir Starmer rose to power in Britain, the political machine responsible for his rise ran a behind-the-scenes campaign to demonetize the U.S. news outlet Breitbart. The attacks on Breitbart were part of a targeted campaign against media outlets on both the left and right considered hostile to the centrist faction of the Labour Party, according to a trove of documents that expose the operation. Many of the documents were revealed for the first time in my recent book – called “The Fraud: Keir Starmer, Morgan McSweeney and the Crisis of British Democracy” – and are expanded on significantly there.The campaign succeeded in effectively destroying the left-wing British outlet The Canary, which is only now recovering. Breitbart News persists.The project was run through an organization called Stop Funding Fake News (SFFN). SFFN was incubated and resourced by a think-tank called Labour Together under the guise of fighting misinformation and “fake news.” Between 2018 and 2020, the anodyne-seeming think-tank received £739,000 in donations that it failed to report to the UK Electoral Commission, in violation of electoral law. Labour Together was found guilty and fined in September 2021 for the offense.Morgan McSweeney, now Sir Keir Starmer’s chief of staff, was Labour Together’s company secretary during this period. He also listed himself on LinkedIn as Labour Together’s “Managing Director.” In October 2024, the prominent UK journalist Andrew Marr commented that McSweeney held a position “of unparalleled power in Labour Party history.”\n\nOf course, Breitbart picked up on the story as well, as they were one of the outlets targeted by Starmer and his government.\n\nRemember Sleeping Giants? Equivalent operations in Britain, which targeted our company with demonetization campaigns, were reportedly masterminded by Keir Starmer's chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney.McSweeney’s well-funded \"Labour Together\" think tank spun off organizations… pic.twitter.com/1WRcuLO1kB— Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) December 4, 2025\n\nHere's more:\n\nThe crackdown on freedom of expression and dissenting thought by the UK’s Labour government was hard-baked into its DNA long before it took power, with the “the most powerful unelected official in British politics” having run a shadowy astroturf organisation working to destroy unaligned news outlets including Breitbart, a report states.A Labour Party thinktank cutout posing as a grassroots anti-“Fake News” group worked to kneecap left-wing outlets that were a threat to its globalist-left worldview, and right-wing outlets that positively covered U.S. President Donald Trump and ‘Mr Brexit’ Nigel Farage, it is claimed. The revelations come in an article published by Dropsite News by South African investigative journalist Paul Holden, citing “a trove of documents that expose the operation” and promoting his forthcoming book.\n\nBreitbart became a target of the aforementioned SFFN in October 2019 when a now-deleted Twitter account by user Slaro Vekonai (@slarethestoic) sent a tweet to the U.K. Parliament's Twitter account. That tweet read, \"You may not know it, but you advertise on Breitbart, a toxic and extremist American site. Can you please adjust your programmatic ad buy so your ads don't show up there due to retargeting? Thank you!\" That tweet also tagged the @slpng_giants and @SFFNews accounts, with SFFN later amplifying the tweet and accusing Breitbart of being a \"bigoted, conspiracist fake news site.\"\n\nThe Associated Press then contacted Parliament, which announced it was suspending the ads. Later in October 2019, SFFN confirmed that the U.K. Cabinet Office had created a \"white list\" of approved sites to advertise on, and several, including The Canary, Evolve, Rebel, and Breitbart, would no longer receive government advertising. But the attacks didn't stop there. The U.K. account for Ford was also tagged about ads appearing on Breitbart, and Ford responded that it was \"investigating the ad placement\" before confirming that Ford \"does not share the views expressed on the website.\"\n\nTwo years later, SFFN was targeting Breitbart's YouTube account, too, complaining the website \"consistently denied climate change, promoted sexism, [and] published racist conspiracy theories\" on their monetized YouTube channel while encouraging companies to block ads on Breitbart's YouTube content.\n\nIt's no coincidence that Starmer's government recently passed the \"Online Safety Act\" that age-restricts websites and censors social media. The goal is not to protect children from harmful content, but to institute government control of the Internet.\n\nThis is important because, back in October, former President Barack Obama was making the rounds and pushing for sweeping, globalist censorship of the Internet. In June, he spoke of the need for \"new forms of journalism\" and said, \"We don’t want diversity of facts. That, I think, is one of the big tasks of social media. By the way, it will require some government...regulatory constraints.\"\n\nAll of this is connected, of course. The global Left sees free speech — mainly American free speech — as a threat to its agenda, and clearly fears unregulated social media. And the U.K. government used its power to try and silence an American media outlet because it didn't like its reporting.\n\nThat cannot stand and we must fight back against it.\n\nEditor’s Note: The Democrat Party has never been less popular as voters reject its globalist agenda.\n\nHelp us continue exposing Democrats' plans to lead America down a dangerous path.

It’s stunning! I think the word of the day, to borrow a phrase from the current president – yuge, yuge.”\n\nHe pointed out that just 31 percent of 18 to 24-year-olds voted for Trump against Joe Biden in 2020, according to CNN exit polls, but, in 2024, the Republican nominee won 43 percent of the same demographic, helping him beat Kamala Harris with ease.\n\n“There was more of a jump in his support among Generation Z than any other generation. They were key for him,” Enten said.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the president’s astonishing comeback victory last year, much of the credit was given to his youngest son, Barron Trump, for steering him towards guest spots on right-wing podcasts like those hosted by Joe Rogan, Theo Von, Logan Paul and others to secure the votes of the disaffected young men making up the “manosphere.”\n\nHowever, Rogan, for one, appears to have become increasingly critical of Trump of late and has called his crackdown on undocumented migrants “f***ing nuts” and, most recently, ridiculed him for texting like a “79-year-old kid.”\n\nThe comedian has also walked away from the man he endorsed’s ongoing insistence that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from him by an elaborate conspiracy to hack voting machines and destroy ballots.\n\n“I don’t think they have any evidence,” Rogan said in August. “I think there’s a lot of speculation and there’s a lot of consideration about mail-in ballots. There’s a lot of shenanigans. There’s a good record of shenanigans and there’s the reality of any kind of electronics can be hacked.”\n\nAnother recent CBS News/YouGov poll from late November offered plenty of clues as to why young people might be feeling disillusioned at the close of Trump’s first year back in office. \n\nThat survey revealed widespread disapproval of his administration’s aggressions towards Venezuela, concern about the inflated cost of groceries, anxiety about the president’s mass deportation program and a desire for more disclosures about Jeffrey Epstein, with respondents expressing distrust of Trump’s rhetoric on all four subjects.\n\nNovember, meanwhile, saw the youthful democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani win the New York City mayoral race at a canter by running an inspirational campaign on an affordability agenda that caught the imagination of younger voters.\n\nEnten noted that data from another pollster, Gallup, had recently revealed that 49 percent of people aged 18-34 now hold a favorable opinion of socialism, compared to 43 percent who still feel warmly about capitalism.\n\nYet another recent poll, this time from McLaughlin and Associates, looked ahead to the question of Trump’s successor and found that while Vice President JD Vance was way out in front, his August lead of 20 points had been reduced to 18 by Donald Trump Jr. \n\nThe president’s eldest son remains a popular figure among his MAGA base.

What a privilege! To be welcomed into your homes night after night, delivering the news / meeting extraordinary people and telling their stories. A couple weeks to go; until then, see you on The CBS Evening News every night at 6:30.\"\n\n DuBois' announcement comes just weeks after his co-anchor, Dickerson, confirmed that he will be leaving the network as well.\n\n On Oct. 27, Dickerson said in an Instagram post that he will exit CBS after 16 years at the end of the year.\n\n \"I am extremely grateful for all that CBS gave me — the work, the audience’s attention and the honor of being a part of the network’s history — and I am grateful for my dear colleagues who’ve made me a better journalist and a better human,\" he wrote in the caption.\n\n DuBois' exit comes amidst several changes at CBS News following Skydance’s $8 billion acquisition of Paramount, CBS' parent company. The merger came after CBS News settled a lawsuit with President Donald Trump, who accused 60 Minutes of deceptively editing former Vice President Kamala Harris' 2024 campaign trail appearance on the show.\n\n Paramount agreed to pay $16 million to the president's future presidential library. Initially, the lawsuit sought $10 billion in damages, and led to concerns over the precedent Paramount would set for media companies by giving into Trump's demands.\n\n Additionally, in October, Bari Weiss, who is best known for running the opinion website The Free Press, was named editor in chief of CBS News, despite having no experience running a news organization of CBS' size.\n\n Dickerson and DuBois were announced as the new co-anchors of CBS Evening News in August 2024. Their appointment came amidst Norah O'Donnell's exit after 12 years as anchor.\n\n “With Norah’s decision, we began reimagining and redesigning the Evening News,\" CBS News and Stations president and CEO Wendy McMahon said in a statement at the time. \"The strength of CBS News has always been in its ensemble of journalists, both in front of and behind the camera, and our goal with John, Maurice, Margaret and Lonnie at the Evening News is to elevate the best in their fields every night for our viewers.\"\n\n Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\n Following DuBois' announcement on Thursday, Dickerson paid tribute to his co-anchor in an Instagram post as he shared a photo of them together and a shot of DuBois covering the L.A. fires.\n\n He said his co-anchor was \"always ready to race off to cover a shooting, fire, riots, devastating floods, or the changing of a Pope — all of which he did — and cover all with empathy and equanimity.\"\n\n \"What I learned in the dance we go through every evening is how much he cares about words, the important stories, conveying exactly the precise thing and minimizing the b.s. We had a glitch the other night and we improvised on the fly without issue, relying on instincts we’d built together, which felt like a fitting end,\" Dickerson continued. \"Maurice, I am grateful to have worked with, and learned from you.\"\n\n During his 21 years at CBS, DuBois anchored CBS New York and appeared on CBS Mornings, 48 Hours, 60 Minutes Sports and CBS Sunday Morning. He previously worked at NBC News, appearing on Today, Dateline, MSNBC and NBC News at Sunrise.","summary":"DuBois and Dickerson have co-anchored the show since January, following Norah O'Donnell's exit","url":"https://people.com/maurice-dubois-announces-exit-from-cbs-evening-news-11862780","image":"https://people.com/thmb/ub6thzHIAJNz9hWex8jjc0xwJ7M=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(969x329:971x331)/Maurice-DuBois-from-CBS-News-120525-1-157b47f26b0d4e5e95437e53b28ba2a9.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-05 17:00:56","author":"Julia Moore","authors":["Julia Moore"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.088},{"id":385401712,"title":"Memo to the GOP: Stop Enabling Your Destroyers — and If You Want Names, I’ll Give You Names","text":"When Muslim martyrs die, they spend eternity in heavenly bliss with 72 sexy, gorgeous virgins. (Among many other perks and goodies.) But after Saint Peter — one of the greatest Christian martyrs — was crucified upside-down, he somehow ended up manning the Pearly Gates’ admissions desk ‘til the end of time.\n\nIt’s an interesting contrast: Would you rather spend eternity in a never-ending ménage-à-many, or stamping hands, working for the admissions office? \n\nCultural interpretations reveal more than you think.\n\nObviously, the implication of Saint Peter’s vocational fate (in popular culture, at least) is that it’s a divine honor to welcome new arrivals into Heaven. It’s not a punishment, but an extra-special blessing for an extra-special saint.\n\nAnd I agree: All groups — whether they’re heavenly, earthly, or anything else — must have a system for separating the wheat from the chaff. It’s even inscribed in the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nFreedom of association necessarily implies the freedom to disassociate, too.\n\nBut before we delve into the heart of our essay, let’s take a brief detour: Do you realize how close President George W. Bush came to giving the Democrats our entire country?\n\nForget about the Iraq War: THIS was President Bush’s greatest mistake, because the Iraq War was recoverable. Had the Democrats stayed unified, it would’ve been game, set, and match for our two-party system.\n\nThe Democrats, you see, came within a whisker of a permanent monopoly in 2007. It was all within their grasp — and then it slipped through their fingers because they got too damn greedy.\n\nRepublicans should consider it a cautionary tale.\n\nPresident George W. Bush pushed hard for comprehensive immigration reform. So, in the final years of his presidency, he offered America’s 12 million illegal aliens a clean, open path to U.S. citizenship.\n\nWhich would mean, of course, 12 million new Democratic voters.\n\nPresident Bush’s only preconditions were a series of “triggers” designed to close the border first. After that, the 12 million illegals “living in the shadows” would be as American as you and me.\n\nThe immigration reform bill needed to reach the 60-vote threshold in the Senate to end debate. The closest they got was 46-53.\n\nAmazingly, 16 Democrats voted AGAINST the bill. Had they stayed unified, the bill would’ve passed.\n\nAnd today, since the southern border is now closed (we just hit a six-month streak of zero illegal crossings), all those millions of foreigners would be U.S. citizens. All the Democrats had to do was keep their mouths shut and not obstruct!\n\nBut they couldn’t resist, because the bill didn’t give them EVERYTHING on their wish list. For example, President Bush wanted to cap the “family reunification limit” to the illegal alien’s nuclear family; ultra-liberal senators demanded that their extended family — all the cousins, nephews, and in-laws — gain U.S. residency/citizenship rights, too.\n\nIf their amendment (sponsored by Democrats Chris Dodd and Robert Menendez) to expand family reunification had passed, more Democrats would’ve undoubtedly voted yes. \n\nFortunately, it failed.\n\nWhen Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) explained why he voted no, he specifically cited the bill’s prioritization of skilled workers over unskilled “family preferences”:\n\n[T] the current Senate bill dramatically changes more than 40 years of family-based legal immigration by eliminating existing family preferences in favor of well-educated, higher-income workers — workers who would provide even further competition for American jobs. Under this provision, it is entirely possible that my mother would have been prevented from immigrating to this country. \n\nKeep in mind, Donald Trump beat Kamala Harris by less than 2.3 million votes. If Sen. Harken and the rest of the Dems valued victory over “legislative perfection” (or platitudes about dear ol’ mom), the bill would’ve passed with a whopping 62 votes — and President Bush would’ve signed it into law.\n\nAnd Kamala Harris would be president today.\n\nMost of the time in politics, you’re not gonna get everything you want. The entire process was designed to be slow, grinding, and inefficient. You’ve gotta be smart enough to take the win, even if the win isn’t 100% perfect.\n\nIt’s called “The Art of the Deal.”\n\nWhich is why it’s absolutely critical for political parties — and political movements — to act like Saint Peter and exercise their freedom of disassociation, excising and disregarding the demands of the dopes, morons, nutjobs, and absolutists.\n\nAn example of a GOP absolutist is Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.). He’s more concerned with performative perfection than advancing the football. \n\nThat doesn’t work in legislative bodies like the House or the Senate, because nothing moves forward without partisan teamwork.\n\nRelated: PR Jiu Jitsu: Agree to a Full, Independent Investigation of the Boat Strike — But With One Condition\n\nNormally, I love nutjobs. Always have: If there are two guys sitting at the bar, and one of ‘em is in a business suit, reading the Wall Street Journal, and the other is missing six fingers, wearing an eyepatch, and downing shots, I’m gonna sit next to the guy in the eyepatch, ‘cause he has AT LEAST one really good story to tell.\n\nSome of my best friends are nutjobs. (They’re good people.)\n\nBut for the love of God, you can’t put them in charge of your movement. They’re designed for entertainment — not leadership positions.\n\nEven worse are the nutjobs who want to hijack your political party to advance their own agenda. Because they don’t care about your political party; they only care about what your political party can do for them. They’re not in it for the same reasons as you and me.\n\nFor them, it’s a means to an end — and the end of our party.\n\nNick Fuentes, Tucker Carlson’s favorite neo-Nazi, is quite candid about his strategy: Infiltrate conservative groups, attack ‘em from the right, and turn white nationalism into a mainstream Republican issue.\n\nHe’s openly telling you what his game is:\n\nThis is why we need to be negative. This is why we need to threaten to withhold our support. This is why we need to make it unignorable and visible. Because if we do, then Trump will be forced to pander to us. […]How do you get the politicians to do what you want them to do? Threaten to withhold support. Critique them, attack them, do it from the right. It doesn’t matter if you do it from the left. The left is already the enemy. Do it from inside, do it from within the right wing. That’s what they’re worried about. And that’s the model. [emphasis added]\n\nTheir goal is division. (And they’re really good at it.)\n\nThe GOP better wake the hell up and realize that the Carlson/Fuentes path is political suicide: Donald Trump won 55% of the white vote in 2024, plus record-setting numbers of minorities.\n\nThose were the ingredients of his landslide victory in the Electoral College.\n\nBut if we lose all minority support by becoming a party of white nationalists, even if our 2028 nominee gains an incredible 75% of the white vote… he’d still lose by 12 points.\n\nThe math doesn’t work. Stop listening to the nutjobs!\n\nSigh. Where’s Saint Peter when you need him?\n\nOne Last Thing: The Democrats are on the ropes, but make no mistake: The donkeys are still dangerous.

But it remains unclear whether the redistricting plan, which President Donald Trump has pushed, has sufficient support for passage in the state Senate. \n\nRepublicans hold supermajorities in both chambers. \n\nThe new map, which passed the state House by a vote of 57-41, would target the two Democrat-held seats: Rep. Frank J. Mrvan’s 1st District in the state’s northwestern corner and Rep. André Carson’s Indianapolis-centered 7th District. \n\nUnder the new map, Carson’s seat would be dismantled, with the Democratic stronghold of Marion County split among four districts. The 7th District, which backed Kamala Harris by more than 41 points last year, would shift to one that backed Trump by 38 points, according to calculations by Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales. \n\nMrvan, who is already a GOP target this cycle, would see his Gary-anchored district shift from one that Trump lost by less than half a percentage point to one he would have carried by 12 points. \n\nIn all, Trump would have carried every Indiana seat by double digits under the redrawn map, according to Inside Elections. \n\nThe Indiana Senate is expected to take up the measure when lawmakers return to the state Capitol on Monday, but several Republican state senators have already declared they will oppose the bill. On Friday, 12 Republicans in the state House joined Democrats in voting against the new map, Indiana Capital Chronicle reported. \n\n“The issue of redrawing Indiana’s congressional maps mid-cycle has received a lot of attention and is causing strife here in our state,” Senate President Pro Tempore Rodric Bray said in a statement last month announcing his chamber would meet the week of Dec. 8 to consider “any redistricting proposal sent from the House.” \n\nBray had initially resisted the redistricting effort, declaring that there weren’t enough votes in his chamber.\n\nThat prompted an angry reaction from Trump, who has urged Indiana to join other GOP-controlled states in redrawing their congressional lines to help House Republicans flip seats and maintain their majority in next year’s midterm elections. \n\nTrump referred to Bray and state Sen. Greg Goode as RINOs, or Republicans in Name Only, and signaled he would support primary challengers against GOP state senators opposed to the effort. Amid the public criticism from Trump, at least 11 elected Indiana Republicans have been targets of swatting incidents since the state Senate’s initial decision to forgo mid-decade redistricting. \n\nThey included GOP state Sen. Jean Leising, who said over the weekend that her house was the target of a pipe bomb. Leising said last week that she remained opposed to redrawing Indiana’s congressional lines. \n\n“It is disappointing that redistricting is taking attention away from issues relevant to my constituents,” she said in a statement. “I will not cave on my position against redistricting but will stay focused on the needs of my seven-county district and the state of Indiana.”\n\nAttempts to redraw congressional lines have spread across the nation to both red and blue states.\n\nTexas Republicans kicked off the process with a new map that could help the GOP gain up to five seats. That map received the green light from the Supreme Court on Thursday, reversing an earlier lower-court ruling. \n\nCalifornia responded to Texas’ move with a map, approved by state voters via a ballot measure last month, that could flip an identical number of seats for the Democrats. Republicans could see one-seat gains in Missouri and North Carolina under those states’ new lines. A new map in Ohio could help Republicans flip two seats there, while Utah’s new map gives Democrats a clear shot at gaining a Salt Lake City-anchored seat. \n\nOther states pursuing mid-decade redistricting include Democrat-controlled Maryland and Virginia, and GOP-led Florida, where a state House redistricting committee met Thursday.\n\nAndrew Menezes contributed to this report.","url":"https://rollcall.com/2025/12/05/indiana-house-congressional-map-republicans/","image":"https://rollcall.com/app/uploads/2025/12/house_votes705_051823.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-05 16:22:40","author":"Posted December 5, 2025 At 4:22pm","authors":["Posted December 5, 2025 At 4:22pm"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.304},{"id":385379472,"title":"Gavin Newsom&#039;s Presidential Chances Get Major Boost","text":"California Governor Gavin Newsom’s chances of becoming the Democratic Party’s next presidential candidate have improved, according to polling.\n\nEmerson College’s latest polling shows that the proportion of people who would vote for Newsom in the Democratic presidential primaries has increased by 13 points from August to December.

He has also delivered a number of speeches around the country criticizing the Trump administration and recently trolled President Donald Trump on social media by copying his posting style and taking umbrage with his policy offerings, which has boosted his profile. The governor has also led a redistricting push in California to help Democrats win future elections.\n\nWhoever wins the Democratic presidential primary will set the party’s agenda and bear a lot of responsibility for healing rifts between moderates and progressives and for beating the Republicans in 2028.\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom speaks during a rally with Harris County Democrats in Houston, Texas, on November 8, 2025.\n\nWhat To Know\n\nAccording to Emerson’s poll of 567 likely primary voters, 36 percent would vote for Newsom, while 16 percent would vote for former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.\n\nWhen Emerson polled people in August, Newsom led by a narrower margin—23 percent to 17 percent for Buttigieg.\n\nThe new poll, conducted between December 1 and 2, also found that New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez had 13 percent of the vote and former Vice President Kamala Harris had 9 percent. Fifteen percent said they would support someone else, and 11 percent said they were undecided.\n\nIf Newsom leads the Democratic Party, he is likely to take a moderate approach.\n\n“We have to be a party that understands the importance and power of the border, substantively and politically,” he said during a Wednesday talk at the New York Times‘ DealBook Summit. He added that Democrats need to develop a “compelling economic vision for the future where people feel included.”\n\nMeanwhile, according to an Emerson College poll from October, if Newsom were pitted against Vice President JD Vance in the next election cycle, 46 percent would support Vance, while 45 percent would opt for Newsom. Commentators have suggested Vance might run to succeed Trump.\n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom told CBS News in October: “Yeah, I’d be lying otherwise,” in response to a question on whether he would consider a presidential bid. “I’d just be lying.

While the Trump administration has all but stopped the crush of migrants that occurred during Biden’s term, neither the government nor the nonprofits that were largely responsible for resettling this vulnerable population of unaccompanied minors have been able to tell RealClearInvestigations where they are living.\n\nExperts say it’s likely that the overwhelming majority of unaccompanied minors remain off the grid because their parents, guardians, and caregivers do not want to draw the attention of immigration authorities. But they also acknowledge the likelihood that some of the migrant minors have been picked up by human traffickers and forced into exploitative labor and sexual roles – a criminal trend that’s on the rise in the U.S. \n\nThis story has been forgotten as politicians and the media have turned their attention away from immigration after Trump virtually closed the southern border. But the recent shooting of two members of the National Guard in Washington, D.C., by an Afghan refugee who had collaborated with the U.S. special forces has brought the issue of a broken immigration system back to the forefront. \n\nNearly half a million unaccompanied minors under the age of 18 were apprehended at the border between 2021 and 2024, overwhelming the immigration system. Taxpayers spent more than $23 billion on a network of government agencies, construction companies, and nonprofits charged with finding them a safe place to live while sponsors were sought. \n\nNow the entities that took the money are unwilling to address the whereabouts of the minors. Nor are they forthcoming about how they spent – or misspent – the funding that was supposed to avoid the very problem the nation faces of missing migrant children.\n\n“They don’t want to talk about it,” said Mark Krikorian, the executive director of the conservative Center for Immigration Studies. “Those groups are the very ones that were pressing to release the unaccompanied kids faster.” \n\nThe Biden Migrant Surge\n\nThe problem of unaccompanied minors began when Joe Biden took office and embraced more lax policies at the border. During Trump’s first term, an average of 43,707 minors annually crossed the border alone; the figure dropped to 15,381 when the pandemic emerged in 2020. In 2021, however, that figure skyrocketed to 122,731, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). In 2022, the number hit an all-time high of 128,904 before tapering off to 98,356 in 2024. These numbers represent the unaccompanied minors that were encountered by U.S. officials and do not include “gotaways,” so the actual total is significantly higher.\n\nAll told, the average annual number of unaccompanied children coming to the U.S. under Biden was nearly double the highest single prior year of 2019, ICE figures show. More than half of those who came each year since 2019 were 16 years old or younger, with nearly a quarter aged 12 or younger. \n\nThis year, monthly data indicates the problem of newly arriving unaccompanied minors has virtually disappeared. In October, the average number of “children in care” was 2,244.\n\n“Sealing the border had made a huge difference,” said Laura Lederer, a former senior advisor on trafficking in persons for the State Department. “Stopping illegal immigration is essentially a human trafficking prevention program.”\n\nRise in Human Trafficking\n\nFor undocumented minors already in the U.S., they are at risk of falling victim to predators who can take advantage of their separation from family and caregivers. Recent press accounts have described horror stories, with minors allegedly exploited from North Carolina to Los Angeles. Precise figures on victims of sexual trafficking or forced labor are impossible to find because the illegal operations are underground.\n\n“For everyone we know about, there could be two, three, or even four times more,” said Lederer, a leading American researcher on human trafficking. \n\nThe process of illegal immigration, which has been a cash cow for smuggling organizations, also claims victims. Minors may fall prey to groomers or recruiters and be forced to function as lookouts, guides, or spies, according to the Department of Defense’s Combating Trafficking in Persons unit.\n\nEven federal agencies involved in finding minors are tight-lipped about their operations. In recent weeks, a Memphis Safe Task Force, led by the U.S. Marshals Service and including teams from ICE and Customs and Border Protection, has rescued 116 juveniles. How many of those were unaccompanied minor border crossers is unclear. The U.S. Marshals Service did not respond to questions.\n\nIowa Republican Sen. Charles Grassley has been following the issue for years. Federal whistleblowers at his hearings have described a haphazard system for caring for unaccompanied minors, in which information is not shared among federal agencies, contractors, and law enforcement. Last year, Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) whistleblowers said that contractors would release minors to sketchy, unverified partners, suspicious strip-mall businesses, and, in one Michigan case, in an open field.\n\nPrompted by those reports, Grassley sent referrals to the FBI and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) regarding potentially criminal behavior by more than “100 suspicious sponsors” last year. But the Biden-Harris administration failed to fully respond to two-thirds of the subpoenas issued by law enforcement. In the last four years, there were more than 65,000 reports of possible illegal acts ignored or dismissed, of which roughly 7,300, or 13%, involved human trafficking, according to an Inspector General’s report.\n\nThe Trump administration claims it has processed some 28% of the backlog, leading to 36 investigations accepted for prosecution, seven indictments, 25 arrest warrants, 11 arrests, and three convictions.\n\nBlaming the Problem on Paperwork\n\nWhen Vance spoke about the exploitation of unaccompanied minors in the October 2024 vice-presidential debate, he took his 300,000 figure from a recent report from the DHS’s Inspector General. Within hours, left-wing groups and press outlets sprang to the Biden administration’s defense, downplaying the severity of the situation and insisting the huge number “lacked context.”\n\nSome pro-immigration groups said it was merely “a missing paperwork problem,” according to the Acacia Center for Justice’s Unaccompanied Children Program. It was a “premature” conclusion that they were lost, said the American Immigration Council, while the Young Center for Immigrant Children’s Rights said they were not “effectively lost.”\n\nRCI reached out to all three of those groups repeatedly, asking how they assessed the current situation with unaccompanied minors and whether it has improved under Trump. Only the Acacia Center responded, and then only to repeat its point about paperwork.\n\n“This figure stems from gaps in ICE paperwork, not actual disappearances,” the center’s Deputy Chief of Programs Michael Corradini said. “Many children were never issued Notices to Appear in immigration court, so their absence from court records does not mean they are missing.”\n\nBut Vance’s total was not inaccurate, according to the inspector general’s report. It found that, in addition to the 32,000 cases in which no address was given for where the minor went, there were another 43,000 cases where the minor failed to respond to a summons to immigration court, and 233,000 cases where neither addresses nor phone numbers received a response. In other words, more than 300,000.\n\nThe $23 Billion Network that Flopped\n\nSince the DHS was created, most of the unaccompanied minors have been handled by the ORR. That agency, in turn, will release the minor to a sponsor, and it is at this point that the government often loses touch with the immigrant, several experts told RCI.\n\nNeither ORR nor those agencies above it – the Administration for Children and Families and the Department of Health & Human Services – responded to multiple requests for comment.\n\nThrough ORR, taxpayers spent $23.1 billion on unaccompanied minor-related grants and contracts during Biden’s term, according to usaspending.gov. The office relies on a sprawling network to house the migrant minors and put them together with sponsors. Contracts and grants related to unaccompanied minors comprise the biggest chunk of the office’s spending each year, accounting for more than 91% in FY2021. \n\nConstruction companies like Rapid Deployment Inc., of Mobile, Ala., were paid at least $3.5 billion, and nearly $200 million went to the defense contractor General Dynamics of Connecticut. Much of the funding went to nonprofits, religious charities, and non-governmental organizations that operate foster homes and release the minors to sponsors. Consulting companies, lawyers, and universities also benefited.\n\nDespite the big outlays of money, it seems no group of officials kept tabs on the minors. \n\nCongress has identified some misspending in the program. North Carolina Republican Rep. Dan Bishop said last November that more than $100 million was obligated, and nearly $40 million spent, for an unaccompanied minor home in Greensboro, N.C., that never housed anyone.\n\nAt least one major vendor, Southwest Key Programs Inc. in Texas, has been sued for mistreatment of minors. As the largest housing provider for unaccompanied children, the group received at least $2 billion over just three years, from FY2021 to FY2023, according to government records. Last summer, the Justice Department sued Southwest Key, alleging that for years “multiple Southwest Key employees subjected unaccompanied children in their care to repeated and unwelcome sexual abuse, harassment, and misconduct and a hostile housing environment, including severe sexual abuse and rape.”\n\nFederal tax returns for some of these nonprofits show that the ORR contracts and grants proved very lucrative. Southwest Key, for example, went from reporting revenues of $417.8 million in 2020 to more than $900 million in 2023 and 2024. In those last two years, the Austin-based nonprofit’s CEO, Anselmo Villarreal, was paid more than $1.1 million, while dozens of top executives received annual pay packages ranging from $250,000 to $700,000. In those same two years, Southwest Key spent 76% of its nearly $1 billion in revenue on “salaries, other compensation and benefits,” according to tax returns collected by ProPublica.\n\nEndeavors, a San Antonio-based nonprofit, was paid more than $2 billion, including a $1.3 billion contract in FY2022, and at least $720 million in the other three years of Biden’s term. According to an audit, the nonprofit had minuscule revenues from 2011 to 2020. In 2020, when the nonprofit reported $52.5 million in revenue, it had 10 executives making six figures, topped by CEO Jon Allman at $317,301. In 2023, those in the Endeavors’ C-suite fared even better, with CEO Charles H. Fulghum pulling down $638,472 and three other executives making between $390,000 and $493,000, tax records show.\n\nAnother San Antonio nonprofit, Compass Connections, grew exponentially through unaccompanied minor-related government deals worth nearly $700 million. Compass reported less than $300,000 in revenue for the years 2019 to 2021. Then Compass caught fire, reporting $192 million in revenue in 2023 and $434 million the following year. In 2023, its Chairman Kevin Dinnin received more than $1.3 million in compensation from Compass and related organizations, tax records show.\n\nSouthwest Key, Endeavors, and Compass didn’t respond to requests for comment on the services they provided. Other groups that received much smaller sums, such as the Vera Institute for Justice and the Los Angeles County Fair Association, also declined to reveal anything about how they helped the undocumented minors. \n\nThis prodigious spending appears to have come to a halt in FY2025, which ended last month. In that year, the ORR spent $51.9 million.\n\nSen. Grassley has also been stonewalled by these same groups when he sought information on their services, according to his office. Concerned about possible waste and fraud, Grassley wrote to two dozen contractors twice in 2024, and while some did not respond at all, those that did “provided incomplete and obstructive responses.”\n\n“It really is horrific, what’s been going on,” said Lederer, the former government advisor. “Unfortunately, we usually only learn about it when a child is rescued or is hurt badly. The people that facilitated all this have circled the wagons about what went very, very wrong.”","summary":"On the campaign trail, Vice President JD Vance repeatedly chastised the Biden administration for allegedly losing track of some 320,000 minors who had crossed the border unaccompanied.","url":"https://www.realclearinvestigations.com/articles/2025/12/04/out_of_sight_following_the_money_trail_of_missing_child_border_crossers_1151337.html","image":"https://assets.realclear.com/images/70/703877_6_.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-05 16:08:12","author":"James Varney,RCI","authors":["James Varney","RCI"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.594},{"id":385480634,"title":"FBI deputy director brushes off his claims FBI hid pipe bomb suspect - USA Today","text":"POLITICSDaniel BonginoFBI deputy director brushes off his claims FBI hid pipe bomb suspect\"That’s not what I’m paid for now.\" FBI deputy director brushes off previous claims FBI covered up pipe bomb suspect.

Bongino said the FBI was “pretty comfortable we have our guy.”“Listen I was paid in the past, Sean, for my opinions,” Bongino said. “That’s clear. And one day I will be back in that space, but that’s not what I’m paid for now. I’m paid to be your deputy director, and we base investigations on facts.”On Dec. 4, the Justice Department announced in a news conference they had arrested Brian Jerome Cole Jr., 30, of Northern Virginia.More: Before being picked as deputy director, Bongino suggested in a January 2024 episode of his podcast that the FBI knew the name of the pipe bomb suspect but “just doesn’t want to tell us, because it was an inside job.”The pipe bombs were placed near the offices of the Democratic and Republican national committees on the night of Jan. 5, 2021, the FBI previously said. The explosives did not detonate, but were viable.During their years as far-right media personalities and podcasters Bongino and FBI Director Kash Patel repeatedly cast doubt on the investigation into the pipe bombs found outside the facilities, specifically the one found at the Democratic National Committee headquarters because Kamala Harris, who was then-vice president-elect, was at the facility. “I have zero doubt it was a setup,” Bongino said on his show in January 2024. “Was it government? I don't know. I'm not going to speculate on who did it. Someone who hated Donald Trump planted those bombs there.”During a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in September, Patel defended himself and Bongino as being “private citizens” when those comments were made.“What we have the ability to do is set aside our personal beliefs to deliver the mission of justice for this country, and we're doing it day in and day out,” he said.Contributing: Rebecca MorinSeniors Born 1939-1969 Receive 11 Benefits This Month If They AskSuper Saving Online | AdAdUndoWhy Fans and Whiskey Lovers Are Racing to Own the Commemorative whisky bottleA standout gift — perfect for fans, collectors, or anyone who loves football historyGlosritystore | AdAdUndoCouncil Bluffs: This Is How Much New Windows Should Cost in 2025The True Cost of High-Performance Windows May Surprise YouModern Energy-Saving Windows | AdAdUndoHere Are 27+ Insanely Cool Gifts For Hard To Buy For MenCuratedly | AdAdUndoA Hat Made to Withstand Long Hours in the Winter Cold.FANYIL | AdAdUndoReplace Your Entire Roof in as Little as 1 Day!Don't buy a new roof until you check this out.

Readers also sought life advice from Mel Robbins, campaign books by former Vice President Kamala Harris, among others, and the posthumous memoir from one of Jeffrey Epstein’s accusers, Virginia Giuffre.\n\nHere are 10 notable books of 2025, in no particular order.\n\n“Sunrise on the Reaping,” by Suzanne Collins\n\nSuzanne Collins once swore she was done with “The Hunger Games,” but the author has not given up on her blockbuster series and neither have her readers. “Sunrise on the Reaping,” a prequel set 24 years before the first book, sold more than 4 million copies worldwide, according to Scholastic, even as the press-shy Collins declined to promote it or give any interviews except for one with her editor, David Levithan.\n\nCollins began the series in 2008 and many fans have grown up with it. At an opening night event in February, numerous attendees were in their 20s and 30s and spoke of how their teenage appreciation had deepened for Collins’ dystopian world, in which contestants hunt and kill each other — all while being broadcast live. “As a kid you focus so much on the plot and the action,” explained 26-year-old Savannah Miller. “As an adult I connected to the characters a lot more and had more of an emotional response.”\n\n“The Let Them Theory,” by Mel Robbins\n\nThe year’s most talked about self-help book, Mel Robbins’ “The Let Them Theory,” offered familiar and assuring messages for a troubled time: Focus on the inner self, don’t try to change what you can’t change. Robbins acknowledged debts to everyone from the ancient Stoics to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., and the title of her opening chapter reads like a variation of the Serenity Prayer: “Stop Wasting Your Life on Things You Can’t Control.” Released late last year, Robbins’ blockbuster was high on bestseller lists throughout 2025 and the author appeared everywhere from “Meet the Press” to “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.” Time magazine named Robbins among its top 100 creators: “She’s empowered millions to stop overthinking, start exercising and ignore their inner critic.”\n\n“Flesh,” by David Szalay\n\nLiterary fiction traveled in 2025, from India to New York ( Kiran Desai’s “The Loneliness of Sunny and Sonia”), from Houston to Japan (Bryan Washington’s “Palaver”), from the recent past to the 22nd century ( Ian McEwan’s “What We Can Know”).\n\n“Flesh,” winner of the Booker Prize, was a physical, economic and social travelogue. It’s a deadpan account of a working-class, half-dead Hungarian, István, who proves equally attractive to women and disaster as life pulls him along through sexual improprieties, juvenile detention, military service in Iraq, the good life in London and back down again. Happiness beyond the fleshy kind is almost entirely absent from David Szalay’s novel, but “Flesh” has a subtle, uncanny rhythm that made admirers out of everyone from Dua Lipa to Booker judge Roddy Doyle, who told reporters after the award was announced: “It is, in many ways, a dark book but it is a joy to read.”\n\n“Careless People,” by Sarah Wynn-Williams\n\nSome books make news just by existing: Anticipating an angry response from Meta, Flatiron waited until just days before publication to announce an unflattering insider take on Meta by Sarah Wynn-Williams, a former director of global public policy at was then Facebook. Wynn-Williams alleged that CEO Mark Zuckerberg had offered to accommodate the Chinese government’s demands to censor the social media platform and that Sheryl Sandberg, Joel Kaplan and other executives had enabled an abusive workplace that included sexual harassment.\n\nMeta countered that “Careless People” was a mix of “out-of-date” information and “false accusations,” and it convinced an emergency arbiter that Wynn-Williams had violated a confidentiality agreement and should be barred from promoting her book, which went on to top The New York Times’ nonfiction list. A headline from Vice read: “Meta Tries to Kill Damning Tell-All Book, Accidentally Promotes It to Bestseller.”\n\n“Nobody’s Girl,” by Virginia Giuffre\n\nThe very existence of “Nobody’s Girl” made news, and kept on making news. Six months after the death of Virginia Giuffre, publisher Alfred A. Knopf released her posthumous “Nobody’s Girl: A Memoir of Surviving Abuse and Fighting for Justice.” Her painful accounts of her years as a “sex slave” helped build GOP support for releasing Justice Department files on Epstein, who died in prison in 2019, and to President Donald Trump’s reversing his earlier objections. Her explicit memories of one Epstein client, the former Prince Andrew, helped lead King Charles III to strip his brother of his royal title and banish him to a private residence.\n\n“Their Majesties wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse,” a statement from Buckingham Palace read at the time.\n\n“The Fate of the Day,” by Rick Atkinson\n\nThe second of Rick Atkinson’s planned three-volume history of the Revolutionary War was published to wide acclaim and helped establish him as one of the foremost military scholars of his time, one given a leading voice in Ken Burns’ documentary on the country’s independence. With some 50 pages of source material listed, “The Fate of the Day” combines precise and bloody details of battles fought between 1777 and 1780 with vivid sketches of protagonists known and obscure. “There is no better writer of narrative history than the Pulitzer-winning Atkinson,” a New York Times review read in part.\n\n“Shadow Ticket” (and “Vineland”), by Thomas Pynchon\n\nAt age 89, Thomas Pynchon was back after a yearslong hiatus. “Shadow Ticket” was a characteristically shaggy tale of a 1930s private detective, Hicks McTaggart, whose search for a missing cheese heiress lands him everywhere from Milwaukee to Budapest. Meanwhile, filmmaker Paul Thomas Anderson transformed Pynchon’s 1990 novel about aging radicals, “Vineland,” into one of the year’s most celebrated movies, “One Battle After Another.” Anderson, who faithfully adapted Pynchon’s “Inherent Vice” in 2014, is apparently one of the privileged few to be in contact with the famously private author.\n\n“Realistically, for me, ‘Vineland’ was going to be hard to adapt,” Anderson observed in the movie’s press notes. “Instead, I stole the parts that really resonated with me and started putting all these ideas together. With (Pynchon’s) blessing.”\n\n“Original Sin,” by Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson (Reliving 2024, Part I)\n\nBooks on the winning candidate in 2024, Trump, proved less attractive to readers than accounts about the losing side. “Original Sin,” by CNN’s Jake Tapper and Axios’ Alex Thompson, was among several notable works that looked back and wondered how it went so wrong for the Democratic Party. The Tapper-Thompson book centered on the aging of President Joe Biden, made painfully public when he debated Trump, and on the aides and family members the authors alleged were keeping his cognitive decline a secret. “The original sin of Election 2024 was Biden’s decision to run for reelection — followed by aggressive efforts to hide his cognitive diminishment,” the authors concluded.\n\n“107 Days,” by Kamala Harris (Reliving 2024, Part II)\n\nThe title refers to the hurried (and unsuccessful) campaign the vice president led when she took over from Biden after he dropped out in the summer of 2024. Harris pointed fingers in many directions: at Biden’s staff (“Their thinking was zero-sum: If she’s shining, he’s dimmed”); at herself, and her answer on “The View” that nothing “comes to mind” when asked how she would govern differently than Biden (“I had no idea that I’d just pulled the pin on a hand grenade”); and at the speed of time (“One hundred and seven days were not, in the end, long enough to accomplish the task of winning the presidency”).\n\n“Independent,” by Karine Jean-Pierre (Reliving 2024, Part III)\n\nFormer White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre gained notice simply from the title of her book, “Independent,” an early tip that she had left the Democratic Party. The subtitle promised harsher takes: “A Look Inside a Broken White House, Outside the Party Lines.” Unlike other critics, she didn’t argue that the party had become too “woke” or had stayed with Biden for too long. She objected to how Biden was treated by the press and by fellow Democrats and contended he “remained thoughtful, clearheaded, and well-informed,” however poorly he came across in his debate with Trump. “We had a major miss,” she concluded about the 2024 campaign, “and I was starting to take a hard look at my party.”","url":"https://www.orlandosentinel.com/2025/12/05/notable-books-2025/","image":"https://www.orlandosentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/YE-Books_08961-1.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-05 15:50:58","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.342},{"id":385391520,"title":"10 notable books of 2025: A memoir about Epstein, 'Hunger Games'","text":"By HILLEL ITALIE, AP National Writer\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — The year in publishing saw such notable releases as the latest “Hunger Games” novel and the first book in years from Thomas Pynchon.

The Tapper-Thompson book centered on the aging of President Joe Biden, made painfully public when he debated Trump, and on the aides and family members the authors alleged were keeping his cognitive decline a secret. “The original sin of Election 2024 was Biden’s decision to run for reelection — followed by aggressive efforts to hide his cognitive diminishment,” the authors concluded.\n\n“107 Days,” by Kamala Harris (Reliving 2024, Part II)\n\nThe title refers to the hurried (and unsuccessful) campaign the vice president led when she took over from Biden after he dropped out in the summer of 2024. Harris pointed fingers in many directions: at Biden’s staff (“Their thinking was zero-sum: If she’s shining, he’s dimmed”); at herself, and her answer on “The View” that nothing “comes to mind” when asked how she would govern differently than Biden (“I had no idea that I’d just pulled the pin on a hand grenade”); and at the speed of time (“One hundred and seven days were not, in the end, long enough to accomplish the task of winning the presidency”).\n\n“Independent,” by Karine Jean-Pierre (Reliving 2024, Part III)\n\nFormer White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre gained notice simply from the title of her book, “Independent,” an early tip that she had left the Democratic Party. The subtitle promised harsher takes: “A Look Inside a Broken White House, Outside the Party Lines.” Unlike other critics, she didn’t argue that the party had become too “woke” or had stayed with Biden for too long. She objected to how Biden was treated by the press and by fellow Democrats and contended he “remained thoughtful, clearheaded, and well-informed,” however poorly he came across in his debate with Trump. “We had a major miss,” she concluded about the 2024 campaign, “and I was starting to take a hard look at my party.”","summary":"Suzanne Collins' prequel “Sunrise on the Reaping” sold over 4 million copies.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/12/05/notable-books-2025/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/YE-Books_08961-1.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-05 15:50:58","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.342},{"id":385379686,"title":"10 notable books of 2025: A posthumous memoir about Epstein, ‘Hunger Games’ and reliving 2024","text":"By HILLEL ITALIE, AP National Writer\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — The year in publishing saw such notable releases as the latest “Hunger Games” novel and the first book in years from Thomas Pynchon. Readers also sought life advice from Mel Robbins, campaign books by former Vice President Kamala Harris, among others, and the posthumous memoir from one of Jeffrey Epstein’s accusers, Virginia Giuffre.\n\nHere are 10 notable books of 2025, in no particular order.\n\n“Sunrise on the Reaping,” by Suzanne Collins\n\nSuzanne Collins once swore she was done with “The Hunger Games,” but the author has not given up on her blockbuster series and neither have her readers. “Sunrise on the Reaping,” a prequel set 24 years before the first book, sold more than 4 million copies worldwide, according to Scholastic, even as the press-shy Collins declined to promote it or give any interviews except for one with her editor, David Levithan.\n\nCollins began the series in 2008 and many fans have grown up with it. At an opening night event in February, numerous attendees were in their 20s and 30s and spoke of how their teenage appreciation had deepened for Collins’ dystopian world, in which contestants hunt and kill each other — all while being broadcast live. “As a kid you focus so much on the plot and the action,” explained 26-year-old Savannah Miller. “As an adult I connected to the characters a lot more and had more of an emotional response.”\n\n“The Let Them Theory,” by Mel Robbins\n\nThe year’s most talked about self-help book, Mel Robbins’ “The Let Them Theory,” offered familiar and assuring messages for a troubled time: Focus on the inner self, don’t try to change what you can’t change. Robbins acknowledged debts to everyone from the ancient Stoics to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., and the title of her opening chapter reads like a variation of the Serenity Prayer: “Stop Wasting Your Life on Things You Can’t Control.” Released late last year, Robbins’ blockbuster was high on bestseller lists throughout 2025 and the author appeared everywhere from “Meet the Press” to “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.” Time magazine named Robbins among its top 100 creators: “She’s empowered millions to stop overthinking, start exercising and ignore their inner critic.”\n\n“Flesh,” by David Szalay\n\nLiterary fiction traveled in 2025, from India to New York ( Kiran Desai’s “The Loneliness of Sunny and Sonia”), from Houston to Japan (Bryan Washington’s “Palaver”), from the recent past to the 22nd century ( Ian McEwan’s “What We Can Know”).\n\n“Flesh,” winner of the Booker Prize, was a physical, economic and social travelogue. It’s a deadpan account of a working-class, half-dead Hungarian, István, who proves equally attractive to women and disaster as life pulls him along through sexual improprieties, juvenile detention, military service in Iraq, the good life in London and back down again. Happiness beyond the fleshy kind is almost entirely absent from David Szalay’s novel, but “Flesh” has a subtle, uncanny rhythm that made admirers out of everyone from Dua Lipa to Booker judge Roddy Doyle, who told reporters after the award was announced: “It is, in many ways, a dark book but it is a joy to read.”\n\n“Careless People,” by Sarah Wynn-Williams\n\nSome books make news just by existing: Anticipating an angry response from Meta, Flatiron waited until just days before publication to announce an unflattering insider take on Meta by Sarah Wynn-Williams, a former director of global public policy at was then Facebook. Wynn-Williams alleged that CEO Mark Zuckerberg had offered to accommodate the Chinese government’s demands to censor the social media platform and that Sheryl Sandberg, Joel Kaplan and other executives had enabled an abusive workplace that included sexual harassment.\n\nMeta countered that “Careless People” was a mix of “out-of-date” information and “false accusations,” and it convinced an emergency arbiter that Wynn-Williams had violated a confidentiality agreement and should be barred from promoting her book, which went on to top The New York Times’ nonfiction list. A headline from Vice read: “Meta Tries to Kill Damning Tell-All Book, Accidentally Promotes It to Bestseller.”\n\n“Nobody’s Girl,” by Virginia Giuffre\n\nThe very existence of “Nobody’s Girl” made news, and kept on making news. Six months after the death of Virginia Giuffre, publisher Alfred A. Knopf released her posthumous “Nobody’s Girl: A Memoir of Surviving Abuse and Fighting for Justice.” Her painful accounts of her years as a “sex slave” helped build GOP support for releasing Justice Department files on Epstein, who died in prison in 2019, and to President Donald Trump’s reversing his earlier objections. Her explicit memories of one Epstein client, the former Prince Andrew, helped lead King Charles III to strip his brother of his royal title and banish him to a private residence.\n\n“Their Majesties wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse,” a statement from Buckingham Palace read at the time.\n\n“The Fate of the Day,” by Rick Atkinson\n\nThe second of Rick Atkinson’s planned three-volume history of the Revolutionary War was published to wide acclaim and helped establish him as one of the foremost military scholars of his time, one given a leading voice in Ken Burns’ documentary on the country’s independence. With some 50 pages of source material listed, “The Fate of the Day” combines precise and bloody details of battles fought between 1777 and 1780 with vivid sketches of protagonists known and obscure. “There is no better writer of narrative history than the Pulitzer-winning Atkinson,” a New York Times review read in part.\n\n“Shadow Ticket” (and “Vineland”), by Thomas Pynchon\n\nAt age 89, Thomas Pynchon was back after a yearslong hiatus. “Shadow Ticket” was a characteristically shaggy tale of a 1930s private detective, Hicks McTaggart, whose search for a missing cheese heiress lands him everywhere from Milwaukee to Budapest. Meanwhile, filmmaker Paul Thomas Anderson transformed Pynchon’s 1990 novel about aging radicals, “Vineland,” into one of the year’s most celebrated movies, “One Battle After Another.” Anderson, who faithfully adapted Pynchon’s “Inherent Vice” in 2014, is apparently one of the privileged few to be in contact with the famously private author.\n\n“Realistically, for me, ‘Vineland’ was going to be hard to adapt,” Anderson observed in the movie’s press notes. “Instead, I stole the parts that really resonated with me and started putting all these ideas together.

Warner: The Uniformed Military May Help Save Us From President Trump00:45Continetti: Trump Has Stuck With Hegseth Because He Is Mission OrientedClose \n\nTrafalgar Group chief pollster Robert Cahaly said Republican Matt Van Epps' nine-point margin of victory in last night's special election for Tennessee's seventh congressional district, where Trump won by 22 points last year, is a warning sign that the MAGA message is not getting out. \n\n\"The Republican Party isn't doing the job it needs to at putting out the record... That messaging isn't getting out there beyond conservative media,\" Cahaly said Wednesday night with FNC's \"Ingraham Angle.\"\n\n\"We just got through Thanksgiving Day with three football games that had incredible ratings. Where were the ads touting Republican accomplishments? This is something that needs to be a year-round project. The Democrats have the entire mainstream media hitting 90% of the Republican electorate,\" Cahaly said. \"We cannot rely on just the President and just conservative media to do it. There has got to be real work put into this.\"\n\nROBERT CAHALY, CHIEF POLLSTER, THE TRAFALGAR GROUP: Well, the nine-point victory is a little more concerning when you look at the fact that [former Rep. Mark Green] won by 21.5 when Trump was on the ballot. But if you go back to 2022, he also won by 21 points then. And the fact is, that was an election that was supposedly not a very good election for Republicans.\n\nSo to me, that causes a lot more concern, comparing it with the 2022 midterms—the high-water mark. This is very significant. \n\nThe problem, I think, is a messaging problem. I don't think it's time to panic, but to retool. I think we need to recognize the system is broken, and the Republican Party isn't doing the job it needs to at putting out the record: no tax on tips and overtime, and MAHA making your food better, people aren't crossing the border. To people across the board, that messaging isn't getting out there beyond conservative media. \n\nLAURA INGRAHAM: Doesn't it come down to what Trump and Scott Bessent were talking about yesterday? The economy is moving in the right direction. Obviously, interest rates have to come down, and the President wants that to happen. That's been artificially hurting the economy.\n\nBut if Bessent is right, and the economy really takes off in the first half of next year, moving into the fall, that's really it. Isn't that going to be the bellwether for whether Republicans hold their majorities or even, perhaps, increase their majorities? He's either right or wrong on what's going to happen.\n\nROBERT CAHALY: Absolutely. I mean, if you ask the average Republican, would you rather the economy be great in the fall of 2025 or the fall of 2026? They would obviously say 2026. And you add an increasingly improving economy, with interest rates that may at that point be falling, and maybe the home mortgage game going again—it could be a really good mix.\n\nThe one thing the Republicans should take—and you were right, the President can't lift all of this—there needs to be a better effort to put the message out there. You know, just waiting to dump a bunch of money in the last few weeks in a few specific states or congressional districts, that system is broken.\n\nWe just got through Thanksgiving Day with three football games that had incredible ratings. Where were the ads touting Republican accomplishments? This is something that needs to be a year-round project. The Democrats have the entire mainstream media hitting 90% of the Republican electorate.\n\nAnd we cannot rely on just the President and just conservative media to do it. There has got to be real work put into this.\n\n Recommended\n\n \n\n Speaker Johnson Puts Trump on Speakerphone At Rally For Van Epps In Tennessee District 7 Special Election\n\n December 01, 2025\n\n House Speaker Mike Johnson put President Trump on the speakerphone at a rally Monday morning for Matt Van Epps, in a special election for Tennessee's 7th Congressional district in the Nashville area. \n\nA recent Emerson College poll showed Republican Matt Van Epps leading Democrat Aftyn Behn by...\n \n election 2025matt van eppsTennessee 7Donald TrumpHouse Republicansmike johnson\n \n\n \n\n TN Dem House Candidate Won't Say If She Disagrees With Kamala Harris: \"Honestly, Haven't Thought About It\"\n\n December 01, 2025\n\n Democratic congressional nominee and Tennessee State Rep.

Tim Walz appears keen to clutch pearls and hold President Donald Trump to a different standard than Walz did the previous president — especially after Trump called Walz \"seriously retarded.\"\n\nQuick background\n\nDuring a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Trump leaned into his criticism of Somalia, the rampant fraud in Minnesota's Somali community, and Somalia's top spokeswoman in Congress, Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.).\n\n'This is on top of all the other vile comments.'\n\n\"Somalia, which is barely a country, you know, they have no, anything. They just run around killing each other. There's no structure,\" said the president. \n\nSomalia is a Sunni Muslim nation on the easternmost part of Africa with a population of just over 19 million, a high rate of female genital mutilation, a GDP of $12.94 billion, and an adult literacy rate of 54%.\n\nThe country is a haven for crime and terrorism, ranking 34th out of 193 countries for criminality on the Global Organized Crime Index. With 10 being the most severe, Somalia scores 8.5 for human trafficking; 8 for human smuggling; 9.5 for extortion and protection racketeering; 9 for arms trafficking; 7 for financial crimes; and 7 for trade in counterfeit goods.\n\nTrump appears to suspect that America imported some of Somalia's chronic problems when accepting its refugees. \n\nFollowing a report detailing instances of alleged and confirmed fraud perpetrated by numerous members of the Somali community in Minnesota, Trump announced on Nov. 21 that he was terminating the Temporary Protected Status designation for Somalia.\n\nRELATED: DHS to increase operations in Twin Cities region as Somali fraud becomes unignorable \n\n Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\n\"Somalians ripped off that state for billions of dollars. Billions every year. Billions of dollars, and they contribute nothing. The welfare is like 88%. They contribute nothing,\" continued Trump. \"I don't want them in our country; I'll be honest with you. Some might say, 'Oh, that's not politically correct.' I don't care. I don't want them in our country. Their country is no good for a reason. Their country stinks, and we don't want them in our country. I can say that about other countries too.\"\n\nTrump added, \"We're at a tipping point. I don't know if people mind me saying that, but I'm saying it. We could go one way or the other, and we're going to go the wrong way if we keep taking in garbage into our country.\"\n\n\"Ilhan Omar is garbage. She's garbage. Her friends are garbage. These aren't people that work,\" Trump said, leaving no room for ambiguity. \n\n\"These are people who do nothing but complain.\"\n\nWalz whines, gaslights\n\nWalz made a big show on Thursday of denouncing Trump's remarks and calling on others to do likewise.\n\n\"Donald Trump's calling our Somali neighbors 'garbage' and the state of Minnesota a 'hellhole' is, I'm assuming, is unprecedented for a United States president,\" said Walz, who has bent the truth to his benefit on numerous occasions.\n\nThe use of the term \"garbage\" by an American president in reference to a group of people is not unprecedented. In fact, Walz downplayed former President Joe Biden's use of the term to describe nearly half the country just last year.\n\nWhen stumping for then-presidential candidate Kamala Harris in October 2024, Biden fixated on a joke made by comedian Tony Hinchcliffe about Puerto Rico during a humorous speech at a Trump rally in New York City — a rally that Walz had likened to a Nazi rally. Rather than brush off the joke, Biden apparently tried to outdo Hillary Clinton's \"deplorables\" smear.\n\n\"A speaker at his rally called Puerto Rico a 'floating island of garbage.' Well, let me tell you something,\" said Biden. \"In my home state of Delaware, they’re good, decent, honorable people. The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters.\"\n\nAfter Biden suggested that the over 77.3 million who would ultimately vote for Trump were \"garbage,\" Walz downplayed the remark when asked in a \"CBS Mornings\" interview whether that comment and others like it undercut the Democratic campaign's \"closing message of unity.\"\n\n\"No, certainly not,\" said Walz. \"I think that the frustration we've seen since January 6, the frustration with Donald Trump's rhetoric of division, it does fire passions.\"\n\nAfter suggesting on Thursday that Trump's \"garbage\" remark was a first, Walz, a champion of racist DEI initiatives, said that \"demonizing an entire group of people by their race and their ethnicity — a very group of people who contribute to the vitality, economic [sic], culture of this state is something I was hoping we'd never have to see.

Josh Shapiro critiqued former President Barack Obama's infamous \"bitter\" comments from 2008 in an interview this week, as part of a broader conversation about Democrats struggling to win back the working class. Obama made the controversial comments during a fundraising event in San Francisco, arguing that small towns in the Midwest saw jobs disappear over the previous decade and have begun to \"cling\" to harmful beliefs. \"And they fell through the Clinton administration, and the Bush administration, and each successive administration has said that somehow these communities are going to regenerate and they have not,\" Obama said at the time. \"And it’s not surprising then they get bitter, they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren’t like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations.\" GOV. JOSH SHAPIRO RECALLS GIVING BIDEN BRUTAL REALITY CHECK ABOUT HIS 2024 CAMPAIGN Shapiro told The Atlantic in an interview published Wednesday that Obama's comments likely insulted the working class rather than motivate them. \"I think his understanding of the challenges in those communities was real. But I think instead of offering his prescription for how he’d make it better, he insulted the very folks who were suffering,\" Shapiro said. He compared the comments to former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's \"basket of deplorables\" remarks at a New York City fundraiser, saying he sympathized with the working-class voters who turned to President Donald Trump as a result. HILLARY CLINTON RIPS WHITE MEN OF 'A CERTAIN RELIGION,’ SPARKS BACKLASH FROM CONSERVATIVES \"We can’t ignore the fact that elections are binary choices. And so you’re asking people, at least in the last case, to choose between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump,\" he told The Atlantic. \"We can have this kind of theoretical conversation about Trump, but, like, it was always Trump versus somebody.\" Fox News Digital reached out to Obama's team for comment. In the same interview, Shapiro also denied what former Vice President Kamala Harris alleged in her book, \"107 Days,\" which included discussions of Shapiro and others she vetted to be her running mate. JOSH SHAPIRO SAYS HARRIS IS 'GOING TO HAVE TO ANSWER' FOR WHY SHE NEVER RAISED CONCERNS OVER BIDEN'S HEALTH Harris said Shapiro had asked her staff lots of questions, including \"how he might arrange to get Pennsylvania artists’ work on loan from the Smithsonian.\" She also accused him of wanting to be involved in every decision and said she reminded him that \"a vice president is not a co-president.\" \"That’s complete and utter bull----,\" Shapiro said in response to the unflattering description of him in her book. \"I can tell you that her accounts are just blatant lies.\" Elsewhere in the interview, Shapiro praised Trump as a gifted communicator but said he'd lied to voters to get ahead.

The left is filled with people who use our fraught history of racial discrimination to bludgeon people into silence on any number of issues that could be, even tangentially, related to racial disparities. \n\nUntil recently, the people who are constantly attacked for being racists or white supremacists have been cowed because we don't want to be tarred as racists. \n\nThe taboo is breaking down, now that accusations about racism are as common as grains of sand on a beach. Since we can't avoid being called racists, we are no longer scared of calling it like it is, and unfortunately, some, like Nick Fuentes, seem to revel in dropping racial slurs and accusations, but that is a topic for another day. \n\n— Ann Bauer (@annbauerwriter) December 5, 2025\n\nSomalis have not one, but three units of \"oppression\" in the oppression Olympics, and they and their advocates are trying to use every advantage they have to push back on people noticing that they have been terrible guests in our country.

Somalis have brought with them all the ills of their home country, and in many cases, they are quite proud to have imported their failed culture to Minnesota. Far from acculturating, they have, as a group if not in all individual cases, found that Minnesotans are sheep and they are happy to be wolves. But we have not been able to point any of this out because it is \"racist\" to do so. \n\n.@realDailyWire’s @MaryMargOlohan: “The Mayor of Minneapolis, Jacob Frey, is saying that he’s actually proud to have the largest Somali community in the country and his police chief —President Trump: “Well then he’s a fool.”Olohan: “— well, his police chief is also saying —”… pic.twitter.com/clrlZoIOzG— Curtis Houck (@CurtisHouck) December 3, 2025\n\nTrump: “I wouldn’t be proud to have the largest Somalian [sic] — look at their nation.

Look, these Somalians [sic] ave taken taken billions and billions of dollars out of our country. They’ve taken billions and billions of dollars. They have a Representative, Ilhan Omar, who they say married her brother. It’s a fraud. She tries to deny it now, but you can’t really deny it because, you know, just happened. She shouldn’t be allowed to be a congresswoman and I’m sure people are looking at that and she should be thrown the hell out of our country and most of those people — they have destroyed Minnesota, okay? Minnesota, you have an incompetent governor, you have a crooked governor — he’s crooked as hell, but he’s incompetent. Waltz is — he should be ashamed. That beautiful land, that beautiful state, it’s a hell hole right now and the Somalians [sic] should be out of here. They’ve destroyed our country and all they do is complain, complain, complain. You have her — she’s always talking about the Constitution provides me with a — go back to your own country and figure out your constitution. All she does is complain about this country. And, without this country, she would not be in very good shape. She probably wouldn’t be alive right now. So, Somalia’s considered by many to be the worst country on Earth. I don’t know. I’ve never — I haven’t been there. I won’t be there anytime soon, I hope. But what Somalia and what the Somalian [sic] people have done to Minnesota is — is not even believable. It’s not even believable and a lot of it starts with the governor. ...\n\nAs the fraud that has been officially uncovered tops a billion dollars (and that is just the tip of the iceberg), and people are speaking openly now about the sexual predation of Somalis with less fear, the liberal elite has gone into overdrive to rehabilitate the reputation of the Somalis. \n\nBEYOND PARODY: Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey says he will refuse to cooperate with ICE and then begins speaking in Somali mid-speech pic.twitter.com/5r3pgWJztF— TheBlaze (@theblaze) December 2, 2025\n\nFar from being, as a group, a plague upon our state, they are among the best citizens we have.

Somalia is a total disaster, rivaling Yemen, yet refugees from Somalia (many of whom are members of clans that actively participate in the violence back home and fund it from here), yet Minnesota politicians pretend that their \"diversity\" is our strength. \n\nMinnesota Democratic lawmakers recieved over $50k from Feeding Our Future Fraudsters https://t.co/4R2a4k623c pic.twitter.com/ugqFyCTFR6— New York Post (@nypost) December 4, 2025\n\nIt is striking that the endorsement for the Mayor of Minneapolis, which originally went to Somali Omar Fateh, had to be voided due to...fraud. It is striking that fraud and violence are now common at Democratic Party endorsing conventions because Somalis have brought their culture here. \n\nThe Democrats all shilling for the Somalis may be right that they have become part of the 'fabric\" of Minnesota, but if so, the fabric is getting very frayed. At least when it comes to Democratic party politics. \n\nIlhan Omar threatenes anyone working with the Trump administration that they will “pay a costly price”This is a direct threat against all Trump’s staffers and the entire administration.Will @TheJusticeDept do something? pic.twitter.com/tbDRLRpS23— Libs of TikTok (@libsoftiktok) December 4, 2025\n\nThe Democrats here are very much in a bind, and it is not just their ideological commitment to intersectional politics.

Despite Donald Trump's well-documented and often vitriolic disdain for Taylor Swift—culminating in his infamous declaration of hatred for the pop star—White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt has been unmasked as a secret fan.The revelation comes courtesy of the annual social media ritual known as Spotify Wrapped, which exposed the 28-year-old's listening habits to the world, proving that while she may toe the party line by day, she is jamming to the President's nemesis by night.While the President has spent much of the last year attacking the singer for her political allegiances and branding her as 'woke', his chief spokesperson has seemingly tuned out the noise.Leavitt took to Instagram to share a slide from her 2025 Spotify Wrapped, a personalised summary of a user's most-streamed audio, inadvertently revealing that her musical taste directly contradicts her boss's political enemies list.Karoline Leavitt Reveals Her Top Artists of 2025Like many of her Gen Z peers on social media this week, Leavitt shared her musical highlights with her followers. The list itself was largely dominated by genres that align with the administration's conservative base.Country music star Morgan Wallen secured the top spot as Leavitt's most-listened-to artist of the year. Following Wallen, the list took a distinct turn toward contemporary Christian music, with singers Forrest Frank, Brandon Lake, and Anne Wilson claiming the second, third, and fourth spots respectively.However, it was the artist sitting at number five that raised eyebrows. Despite the frequent and public feuds between the 79-year-old President and the 35-year-old superstar, the Life of a Showgirl singer rounded out the Press Secretary's top five favourites. This inclusion suggests that even within the inner circle of the Trump White House, Swift's cultural dominance is impossible to escape, regardless of political directives.How Karoline Leavitt Navigated Trump's Public Attacks on SwiftThe irony of Karoline Leavitt's playlist is compounded by the fact that she is professionally tasked with defending the President's erratic outbursts against the singer. As many will recall, Trump has made his feelings on Swift abundantly clear for years.Most recently, in August, the President launched an attack on the 'woke' pop star amid a bizarre rant regarding actress Sydney Sweeney's campaign for American Eagle denim.Trump took to Truth Social to defend Sweeney, declaring her controversial 'good jeans' campaign the 'HOTTEST ad out there', while strangely comparing the PR moment to Jaguar's rebrand, which featured androgynous models and a pink car. In a twist that confused many observers, Swift was roped into this diatribe.'Just look at Woke singer Taylor Swift,' Trump wrote in the post. 'Ever since I alerted the world as to what she was by saying on TRUTH that I can't stand her (HATE!). She was booed out of the Super Bowl and became, NO LONGER HOT.'The comments made headlines immediately, forcing Karoline Leavitt to field questions from the press corps regarding her boss's fixation on the singer's appeal. When Fox News' Peter Doocy asked what the President meant by claiming Swift was 'no longer hot', Leavitt managed to keep her secret Swiftie status under wraps with a diplomatic pivot.'Look, he is speaking about Taylor Swift's political views and how perhaps it has impacted the support of the American public for her work, and I will leave it at that,' she answered at the time.A History of Bad BloodThe friction between the White House and the Cruel Summer singer dates back to 2018, when Swift broke her long-standing political silence to endorse Democratic candidates in Tennessee over Republican Marsha Blackburn.At the time, Swift wrote in a lengthy Instagram post that she would 'always will cast my vote based on which candidate will protect and fight for the human rights I believe we all deserve in this country.'Trump's response at the time was dismissive but measured, stating: 'I'm sure Taylor Swift doesn't know anything about (Marsha Blackburn). Let's say that I like Taylor's music about 25 percent less now.'However, that percentage dropped to zero following Swift's endorsement of Kamala Harris over Trump last year, which sparked a massive surge in voter registration. The endorsement led to Trump's now-infamous all-caps declaration on Truth Social: 'I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!'Despite the President's unequivocal hatred, it appears his message failed to reach the Spotify account of his own Press Secretary.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/karoline-leavitts-secret-swiftie-status-reportedly-revealed-spotify-wrapped-post-1760556","image":"https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1770323/karoline-leavitt.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=4ccf8e80c0bd6264a1a7d45f3e0feec9","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-05 13:17:19","author":"Welbert Bauyaban","authors":["Welbert Bauyaban"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.4},{"id":385304886,"title":"Does the World Cup have a Trump problem in the Bay Area?","text":"When President Donald Trump and FIFA President Gianni Infantino announced in August that the World Cup draw — which will determine team groups for the 2026 games, some of which will be played in the Bay Area — would take place Dec. 5 at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., a video circulated globally showing a grinning Trump wearing a red hat that read, “Trump Was Right About Everything.”\n\n“It’s for winners only, and since you’re a winner, you can touch it,” Infantino said, handing the World Cup’s 14-inch, 13.5-pound, 75% pure gold trophy to Trump.\n\n“Can I keep it?” Trump said. “I am not giving it back.”\n\nThe exchange was emblematic of a relationship that blossomed between the U.S. president and the president of soccer’s governing body as the United States prepares to host a majority of the matches in next year’s global tournament. Infantino, who assumed his post in 2016, has spent the last year cozying up to Trump, making appearances at the president’s inauguration in January and a peace summit in Egypt in October where Trump helped broker a ceasefire between Gaza and Israel.\n\nIn early November, Infantino and FIFA created a peace prize to be awarded during the draw ceremony on Friday, when national teams will be assigned to twelve groups of four each; the official locations, venues and times for these matches will be announced a day after. It is widely assumed that the prize will go to Trump, who has been coveting public recognition for his perceived global peace efforts.\n\nWith that gesture and others, FIFA and Infantino have positioned Trump as the face of the 2026 global competition, which is the first World Cup to be hosted by three countries: Mexico, Canada, and the United States. Yet, Trump is unpopular in many of the eleven U.S. cities and regions hosting the matches, including in the Bay Area.\n\nWhat’s more, the president has targeted Democratic-run cities and states in the first year of his second term, threatening to revoke federal funding and cracking down on immigrants living in the country illegally. Trump’s federalizing of the National Guard in cities like Los Angeles and Portland has been met with fierce pushback from Democratic leaders and sparked a deluge of litigation trying to block his control of the troops.\n\nWhether Trump might try to meddle with the status of a U.S.city set to host games next year – most of which are run by Democrats – became a real possibility following a Nov. 17 Oval Office press conference. Flanked by Infantino and Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, the president issued a veiled threat to mayors and governors, telling them to “behave.” Trump also said he’d be happy to send in the National Guard to any city that might want their assistance with keeping soccer fans safe.\n\n“If we think there’s going to be a sign of any trouble, I would ask Gianni to move that to a different city,” Trump told reporters. Trump had suggested moving the World Cup out of “unsafe” cities before.\n\nCostly preparations for the 2026 World Cup, however, have been underway for years – the 16 host cities, which include three in Mexico and two in Canada, were announced in 2022.\n\nThe Bay Area Host Committee, which is covering the cost of putting on the six matches at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, is expected to shell out between $45 million and $50 million. A spokesperson for the organization did not respond to a request for comment about Trump’s remarks. FIFA also did not reply to a request for comment on its close alliance with Trump.\n\nBut U.S. Rep. Ro Khanna, whose congressional district encompasses Santa Clara, said that moving any of the matches six months out would be the wrong decision.\n\n“If Trump really followed through on moving any of the games, it would cause chaos and make the events less safe,” he said in a statement. “There has been years of planning and coordination going into these games, including security.”\n\nSanta Clara County is one of nine counties hosting matches next year that overwhelmingly voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris – the two other U.S. counties, Miami-Dade County in Florida and Tarrant County in Texas, went for Trump.\n\nThat follows a trend that Johan Rewilak, an associate professor of sport management at Loughborough University in the United Kingdom, has noticed. In his research, Rewilak has found a correlation between soccer’s popularity and Democratic voters.\n\n“There’s a strong positive correlation between voting intentions and those who have an affinity with soccer,” he said. “So, typically those who are more Democratic in terms of the polling are those who are pro-soccer and support soccer more than those who are Republican-voting.”\n\nHowever, Rewilak suggests that FIFA and Infantino, instead of solely catering to traditional soccer fans, might be targeting individuals not typically interested in the global sport. Trump, he said, is “very proactive using social media and whether you agree or not, he has a lot of influence.” Many of his voters “will be like ‘it’s OK for us to go watch soccer games, maybe this is for us. If our president is very pro-soccer, maybe we should be.’”\n\nBut Trump’s popularity has plummeted since he took office, with only 36% of Americans approving of his overall performance in November – a 4% drop from the month prior, according to pollster Gallup. That number is even lower among Democrats, with only 3% approving of him nationwide.\n\nJosh Woods, a professor of sociology at West Virginia University who has studied the role of politics in sports, said in an email that “world soccer culture is incompatible with Trump’s nativism and nationalism.” But, Woods added, “given his fondness for the spotlight and high-profile sporting events, his early show of support for the tournament and warm ties with FIFA president Gianni Infantino may hold.”\n\nSome Democratic lawmakers, like Rep. Sam Liccardo, aren’t concerned with Trump’s proximity – or influence – on FIFA officials like Infantino. In an email, Liccardo, who previously served as the mayor of San Jose, said that he met with FIFA during the site bidding process.\n\n“I know that they understand that nowhere else in the U.S. offers a better venue, safer environment or more soccer-crazed fans than we do,” he said.\n\nAs for Trump’s comments on possibly moving matches, the congressmember doesn’t make much of them.\n\n“Everyone in the South Bay is hustling to ensure we’re ready to host an epic World Cup,” he said. “Anything else is a silly distraction.”\n\nDecades prior, a fascist government ruled Italy when it hosted the 1934 World Cup and a military junta presided over the World Cup in Argentina in 1978. In 1986, Mexican President Miguel de la Madrid was widely booed during the inauguration of the World Cup at Azteca Stadium in Mexico City due to his government’s dreadful response to the 1985 earthquake in the city. This year, Trump was also booed at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey during the FIFA Club World Cup final. \n\nRewilak believes people will attend U.S. games regardless of who is the face of the tournament. Case in point: FIFA has already sold millions of tickets for the 2026 World Cup. During the World Cup, the “common goal is supporting the United States national team, and the United States is very patriotic as a country,” Rewilak added.\n\nBut, Woods is not so sure: “Situating President Trump in a prominent role around the final draw for the FIFA World Cup would be like choosing Nancy Pelosi to drive the pace car for the Indianapolis 500, or making Bernie Sanders a guest star on a reboot of Duck Dynasty.”","summary":"The Bay Area will set to host six 2026 World Cup matches as President Trump has threatened to take away games from cities governed by Democrats.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/12/05/donald-trump-2026-world-cup-democratic-cities-santa-clara/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/SJM-L-TRUMPCUP-1205-2.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-05 12:00:05","author":"Gabriel Sama,Grace Hase","authors":["Gabriel Sama","Grace Hase"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.087},{"id":385297022,"title":"Turning Point USA-affiliated tour coming to NJ public school Friday","text":"An event at a Central Jersey middle school is drawing the ire of parents and groups that describe it as nakedly partisan — featuring U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon on a 50-state tour in partnership with conservative groups such as the Charlie Kirk-founded Turning Point USA.\n\nIn a letter to Cedar Drive Middle School families, Colts Neck Superintendent MaryJane Garibay celebrates the visit — part of the History Rocks! Trail to Independence Tour in celebration of the country’s 250th birthday — as an “extraordinary opportunity to highlight the remarkable work of our students, educators, support staff, and Board of Education.”\n\nThe letter describes History Rocks! as a “key component” of the America 250 Civics Education Coalition, which federal Department of Education materials say includes Turning Point USA, Moms for Liberty, the Conservative Partnership Institute, the Heritage Foundation, and other conservative and religiously oriented policy groups. But the letter doesn’t say what, if any, involvement any of those groups would have in Friday’s event.\n\nGaribay’s letter describes the History Rocks! program as “a meaningful, nonpartisan initiative designed to inspire students’ interest in U.S. history and civic responsibility.” It says the event will include a schoolwide assembly, classroom visits and a small-group roundtable with students, teachers and local officials.\n\nSoon after the district’s announcement, a petition began circulating urging the school to keep groups like Turning Point USA out of instructional settings.\n\nMichael Gottesman, founder of the New Jersey Public Education Coalition, said his Facebook and email inboxes were full of messages from people alarmed by the district’s decision to host the event during the school day. Gottesman founded the group to oppose what it calls “right-wing extremists” on school boards amid the growing influence of “parents' rights” groups and efforts to bar books from school and public libraries.\n\n“Our concern is not that the secretary of education is appearing. Our concern is that it appears it's being run by Turning Point USA,” Gottesman said. “Turning Point USA is … a religious organization, and in the past they have had ideologies that are anti-people of color, racist, antisemitic and anti-LGBTQ.”\n\nLGBTQ advocacy organization Garden State Equality also released a statement condemning the event, highlighting the History Rocks! connections to conservative organizations.\n\n“It is outrageous that Dr. Garibay expects the Cedar Drive Middle School community, and the community at-large, to believe that ‘History Rocks’ is a ‘non-partisan initiative,’” Justine Evyn Saliski, the group’s senior director for education and youth development, said in the statement. “Cedar Drive LGBTQ+ middle school students deserve better than this. It is unethical and dangerous to bring such hate-fueled representatives into a public education building.”\n\nNeither Garibay nor the Colts Neck Township Board of Education President Angelique Volpe, whom Garibay credited with bringing the event to Cedar Drive Middle School, responded to requests for comment. An email to the U.S. Department of Education also went unanswered.\n\n“We have to keep an eye on it because it's part of the bigger plan to introduce these types of ideologies into our public school system and to introduce religion into our public school system,” Gottesman said.\n\nLast month, the Colts Neck education board adopted a “Parental Bill of Rights” that mirrors conservative efforts across the country. The policy allows parents to opt students out of lessons that run counter to their religious beliefs. It also gives parents access to information about the name, pronouns, bathrooms and mental health programs their children use.\n\nThe district was also one of several to adopt, but then later repeal, so-called “Policy 5756,” which was based on Gov. Chris Christie-era guidance and generally barred schools from alerting parents about students’ gender identities.\n\nThe vote also follows a pitched legal battle over gender-inclusive education regulations the state Board of Education adopted in 2023. An appeals court upheld the state regulations in September.\n\nColts Neck leans Republican and larger Monmouth County voted for Donald Trump in 2024 by more than 10 points over Kamala Harris.","summary":"U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon\n\n\n  \n\nThe tour is also connected to conservative groups such as Moms for Liberty and the Heritage Foundation.

(Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)\n\nWhich Democrats Are At Risk in Texas?\n\nGreg Casar \n\nAmong the biggest changes affects Texas’ 35th congressional district, which Casar represents. \n\nThe new map moves the district away from Austin and into that of Representative Lloyd Doggett, potentially pitting the two Democrats into a race for the only remaining seat representing Austin or running in a newly created Central Texas district outside of San Antonio that Trump would have won by 10 points in 2024, according to VoteBeat. Casar has said if the new map went into effect, he would run in the Austin-centered 37th congressional district which Doggett currently represents.\n\nLloyd Doggett\n\nAfter the lower court blocked Texas from using the new maps, Doggett said he would run for election in the 37th district. \n\nHe had previously said he would not seek reelection if the newly drawn congressional map went into effect.\n\nJulie Johnson \n\nJohnson’s 32nd congressional district, currently contained mostly in Dallas County, is being expanded into east Texas to favor Republicans.\n\nThe move would shift it from one that voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris by nearly 24 percentage points in 2024 to one that would have favored Trump by nearly 18 points, according to The Dallas Morning News.\n\nMark Veasey\n\nVeasey’s 33rd congressional district would remain solidly blue under the new map, but drops all of Fort Worth, his hometown and political base. \n\nThe new district is based solely in Dallas County and could lead to a primary between Veasey and Johnson, according to the Texas Tribune.\n\nParts of Green’s 9th congressional district, which currently covers the southern part of Harris County, would shift to the eastern part of Houston and become a district hat Trump would have won by 15 points, according to VoteBeat.\n\nHenry Cuellar\n\nCuellar’s 28th congressional district, which is overwhelmingly Hispanic, would become slightly more favorable to Republicans, making reelection more difficult, according to the Tribune.\n\nVincent Gonzalez\n\nGonzalez would see the 34th congressional district, which he represents, become more favorable to Republicans, making his chances of winning reelection harder. He won reelection by just three points last year.\n\nNewsweek has contacted the lawmakers for comment via emails sent outside regular business hours.\n\nWhat People Are Saying \n\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton said in a statement that the Supreme Court’s order “defended Texas’s fundamental right to draw a map that ensures we are represented by Republicans.”\n\nHe said: “Texas is paving the way as we take our country back, district by district, state by state. This map reflects the political climate of our state and is a massive win for Texas and every conservative who is tired of watching the left try to upend the political system with bogus lawsuits.”\n\nTexas Governor Greg Abbott said in a statement on X: “We won! Texas is officially—and legally—more red.”\n\nDemocratic National Committee chairman Ken Martin said in a statement that the Supreme Court’s decision “to allow Texas Republicans’ rigged, racially gerrymandered maps to go into effect is wrong—both morally and legally. \n\n“Once again, the Supreme Court gave Trump exactly what he wanted: a rigged map to help Republicans avoid accountability in the midterms for turning their backs on the American people.”\n\nRepresentative Greg Casar wrote on X after the lower court’s decision last month: “The Trump Abbott maps are clearly illegal, and I’m glad these judges have blocked them. If this decision stands, I look forward to running for reelection in my current district.

The claim was made by several royal experts who spoke to Fox News Digital after the Duke of Sussex joked that President Donald Trump is America’s \"king\" during a cameo appearance on \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.\" The remarks came nearly three months after Trump visited the U.K. for a state visit where he met with the monarch, who is still undergoing cancer treatment. \"Harry’s jab at President Trump on Colbert wasn’t clever – it was reckless,\" Kinsey Schofield, host of YouTube’s \"Kinsey Schofield Unfiltered,\" told Fox News Digital. \"Honestly, how does he think he can hold on to a royal title while taking public swipes at the head of a foreign government?\" MEGHAN MARKLE ACCUSED OF CLINGING TO ROYAL TITLE AFTER RECENT INTERVIEW: EXPERTS \"It’s also a slap in the face,\" Schofield insisted. \"Buckingham Palace put significant effort into a major state visit for President Trump to support diplomatic relations. And, frankly, it’s a slap to President Trump as well, considering he agreed to ease up on Harry’s immigration situation out of personal respect for King Charles.\" Joking about his desire to play the \"Gingerbread Prince\" in a fictional Hallmark Christmas movie, Harry told Colbert, \"Well, you Americans are obsessed with Christmas movies, and you’re clearly obsessed with royalty, so why not?\" \"Hold on, I wouldn’t say we’re obsessed with royalty,\" Colbert replied. WATCH: PRINCE HARRY'S TRUMP JOKE FALLS FLAT WITH LATE NIGHT AUDIENCE \"Really? I heard you elected a king,\" Harry responded, as the audience booed. Harry’s jab echoed anti-Trump sentiment from October’s \"No Kings\" protest, during which scores of liberals and Trump critics demonstrated nationwide to oppose the president’s second-term agenda. Organizers of the protest said they were defending democracy from what they saw as Trump’s authoritarian rule. \"Harry did himself no favors,\" British royals expert Hilary Fordwich told Fox News Digital. \"And to hear that decidedly left-leaning New York City audience boo him – he went from cheers and a standing ovation at first, to that. A few minutes’ summary, if you ask me, of his entire trajectory.\" \"His ghastly, self-defeating swipe at both President Trump and his own royal family signaled yet again his terrible judgment,\" said Fordwich. \"While he still trades on his title, he attacks the monarchy and chronically misreads public mood on both sides of the Atlantic. Instead of healing the wounds he caused, he scratches them open – all while claiming to want to heal.\" CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER Harry followed up by poking fun at Americans for electing \"king\" Trump after \"making such a big deal about my great-great-great-great-great-great-grandfather, George III\" – a reference to the American Revolution. \"Well, he was kind of a jerk,\" Colbert shot back. \"OK, let it go,\" Harry joked. The prince continued, asking Colbert what else he needed to do to convince Americans to cast him in a Hallmark film. \"I’ll record a self-tape, I’ll fly myself to an audition, settle a baseless lawsuit with the White House – all the things you people on TV do,\" he said. WATCH: PRINCE HARRY POKES FUN AT AMERICANS FOR ELECTING KING TRUMP DURING COLBERT APPEARANCE The line was meant as a dig at Colbert’s parent company, CBS, which settled with Trump earlier this year after the president sued the broadcaster for allegedly editing its interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris ahead of the 2024 election. LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS Fox News Digital reached out to the White House for comment. In September, Trump opened a two-day visit to the U.K., calling his meeting with the king, 77, \"one of the highest honors of my life.\" During the trip, he made time for a quiet tribute at Queen Elizabeth II’s tomb. During his visit, Trump was welcomed with the largest guard of honor in living memory – featuring 120 horses and 1,300 troops – as well as carriage rides, an air show and a Windsor Castle state dinner. The 79-year-old also met with Prime Minister Keir Starmer to discuss trade, technology and geopolitical issues. No U.S. president, or any other world leader, has received the honor of a second U.K. state visit. Trump’s first was in 2019, during his previous term. \"The Andrew saga has already left the royal family exposed, and the king is trying to manage those issues while carrying out daily duties and undergoing regular cancer treatment,\" said Schofield, referring to the disgraced ex-Duke of York. \"For Harry to stir up more controversy connected to the family only accelerates internal discussions about removing his titles,\" Schofield claimed. \"If anything, this moment underscores that there is no path back for Harry. For those insisting he could still be a valuable asset, he just proved what a liability he is.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Schofield noted that before Kate Middleton announced her cancer diagnosis in March 2024, Colbert jokingly linked her absence from public life to rumors of an alleged affair between her husband, Prince William, and Rose Hanbury, the Marchioness of Cholmondeley. Colbert later expressed remorse for the jokes after Kate’s diagnosis became public, Vanity Fair reported. \"That was one of the hardest years of William’s life, and he’s acknowledged that publicly,\" Schofield said. \"Colbert’s nasty monologue deeply upset both the prince and princess, who were already under immense pressure as they quietly navigated Catherine’s cancer diagnosis while trying to protect their children from fear or confusion.\" \"While they were living with that burden, Colbert and others used their platforms to push cruel theories, which William was regularly briefed on,\" she continued. \"It caused real pain. Rose was prepared to sue. And for Harry to run onto Colbert’s stage and crack jokes with him tells you everything about where that relationship stands. It’s irrevocably broken.\" The outlet reported that Hanbury's lawyers sent a legal notice to CBS, stating the allegations were false. Harry has been estranged from his family since 2020, when he and his wife, Meghan Markle, stepped back as senior royals. They said the decision was driven by unbearable press intrusion and a lack of palace support. After moving to California, they aired their grievances in interviews and documentaries. Harry’s 2023 memoir, \"Spare,\" further worsened his relationship with the royal family. In May, Harry told the BBC: \"I would love reconciliation with my family. There’s no point in continuing to fight anymore. I don’t know how much longer my father has.\" KING CHARLES' BIRTHDAY OVERSHADOWED BY EX-PRINCE ANDREW 'NIGHTMARE' AS NEW EPSTEIN SCANDALS ROCK MONARCHY Harry met his father before Trump’s state visit, sparking hope among royal watchers of a reconciliation between father and son. Sources previously told People magazine that the king wasn’t responding to Harry’s calls or letters. But not everyone believes Harry’s late-night appearance was catastrophic. \"It was clunky, but not cancerous,\" Doug Eldridge, founder of Achilles PR, told Fox News Digital. \"Objectively speaking, it was pretty benign – this was about visibility.

But the silent treatment won't do","text":"The setting: a two-story home in Whittier prettied with holiday decorations, pet beds, American flags and a shelf of tchotchkes dedicated to John Wayne. The face-off: 63-year-old Gloria Valles and her daughter, 33-year-old Brittney Valles-Gordon. The debate: What else these days? Politics. For two hours on a recent morning, the two went at it like the philosophical equivalent of UFC fighters. Trump. Abortion. The economy. Democrats. Whether ICE agents should wear masks. Trump. Trump. Brittney, a Democrat who works in L.A.'s dining scene, lobbed barbs from the comfort of a couch with an elder shih tzu mix named Chuy by her side; Gloria stood her Republican ground from a recliner covered in a giant Dallas Cowboys blanket. Soon they were going mano-a-mano over an issue roiling many Latinos: Trump's unleashing of ICE and Border Patrol in many of their communities. “Grandma came here as an illegal immigrant,” Brittney reminded her mother, referring to Gloria's mother. “But she made sure to make herself legal.” “ICE doesn’t care about that — they would’ve netted Grandma.” They’re one of many families across Southern California and the country split right now about what President Trump has wrought upon us in his second term. The divisions are especially pronounced among Latinos, a demographic that voted for him in record numbers last year — Gloria and three of her brothers included. Trump had made historic gains among Latinos in the last presidential election, only to drop those gains faster than Tommy \"The Hit Man\" Hearns did Pipino Cuevas. Among the likely reasons, which include the shaky economy: His rancid, malevolent policy toward immigrants, especially those in the country without papers. Too many Latino families I know in this situation aren’t talking right now because of these deep political divisions — including some in my own life. Such scenarios sadden me. But so do the public and private shamings I'm seeing on social media and in my private world of Trumper tíos or cousins who now regret their choice as the president has unleashed the dogs of deportation on Latinos regardless of citizenship status. While it's fun to be right, is schadenfreude really the best way to wean them off Trumpism once and for all? The Valles family provide an intriguing case study that says as much about how Latino politics have evolved over the decades as about the power of patience with those you love. Born in El Paso, Gloria grew up in L.A.'s Eastside in a family where John F. Kennedy was held in such esteem that one of her nieces was named Jacqueline. “It was Democrat, Democrat, Democrat all the way,” she said, a party preference further instilled in her by a mother who raised five children on her own with the help of welfare. “But they [the federal government] told her, ‘You need to go get trained into a job,’ and she did,” eventually working for the Housing Authority of Los Angeles. “Now, we’re just giving out welfare to anyone. ‘You’ve never been here? Here you go.’” Gloria’s politics changed in 1979, after she met her husband. They shared El Paso and Eastside roots — but, unlike her at the time, Jaime Valles was a “straight up Republican.” “He would get political pamphlets for us to read and say, ‘Think for yourself. Don’t vote one way just because people think Mexicans should vote one way.’” For her first presidential election, she chose Ronald Reagan — \"He was handsome, and he believed in rehabilitation [for welfare recipients]. 'You're not going to get free money if you're not going to better your life.'\" The couple raised their four children on the values of hard work and faith. Jaime specialized in satellites for Northrup Grumman; Gloria volunteered as a catechist at the San Gabriel Mission while employed as a school health clerk, a job she still holds. Brittney remembers nights sitting alongside her late father watching Fox News. At Gabrieleno High School in San Gabriel, she started a Republican Club — “just six members” — that mostly amounted to “me telling everyone else, ‘You are all idiots.’” Brittney was such a committed Republican that her AOL Instant Messenger handle was a tribute to John McCain and Sarah Palin’s failed 2008 presidential run. But the first seeds of political doubt started at a confirmation retreat, where she became upset when someone said her brother wouldn’t get into heaven because he was gay. Other family members said homophobic things about him — “the Venn diagram of being Catholic, Republican and Latino,” Brittney said as Gloria shook her head in disagreement. Working in the food industry exposed Brittney to anti-Latino discrimination. Then she went to Rio Hondo College — “You take one Chicano Studies class, and wow. ... My dad always said he regretted letting me go to higher ed,” Brittney said, as Gloria laughed. Brittney nevertheless voted for Mitt Romney in 2012 for her first presidential vote and admitted that Trump initially intrigued her when he announced his candidacy in 2015. “I read ‘The Art of the Deal’ and thought, 'Maybe this is what we need.' But then you quickly saw his cruelty on display,” mentioning his infamous remark secretly recorded about grabbing women “by the pussy.” “There was times I was offended, but sometimes he said the truth and the truth hurts,” her mother responded. “How can I say it…” “Just say it, girl!” Brittney exclaimed. “We needed new blood.\" Brittney went with Hillary Clinton in 2016 and has voted for every Democratic presidential candidate since. But she became frustrated as progressives kept dismissing Latino Trump supporters like her parents as assimilated anomalies even as more Latinos drifted toward Trump every time he ran. The end result: 48% of them chose him in 2024 — the highest share of the Latino vote by any Republican presidential candidate. \"Liberals can be intolerant,\" said Brittney, a flash of her old GOP days emerging. “You don’t change someone's opinion by being a bully to them. You do it with empathy. And don’t expect someone to flip overnight. It makes them hold on to their beliefs more when you tell them that they’re dumb.” Gloria voted for Trump a third time in 2024 because she felt Kamala Harris was “going to continue [Joe Biden's] bulls—” but also because Trump’s promise to deport violent criminals resonated with her. She remembered shopping trips in Ciudad Juarez with family members that had to end because of cartel violence in the Mexican border town. “Yes, this is what we need — clean it up,” she thought. “We want him to take out everyone who’s breaking laws and not trying to do things right.” Then for the first time all afternoon, her tone turned serious in a kind of self-correct. “That’s not happening.” “Deporting people who are making an honest living — that’s wrong. Or people who are trying to legalize themselves. They’re doing it the right way and what we want them to do, but you’re killing their hope” by grabbing them during court appointments,\" she said. \"That upsets me a little.” Gloria sounded like the living incarnation of a recent Pew Research Center poll that showed an 11% drop in support for Trump among Latinos who voted for him and that 47% of Latino Republicans think the Trump administration \"is doing too much\" on the deportation front — up from 28% in March. Then, just as quickly, the Republican in her roared once more. She said Trump didn't deserve the blame for the cruelty of immigration agents (\"His rhetoric is what inflames them,\" Brittney countered) and blasted pro-immigrant activists for their protest tactics. She described how a family member earlier this year was nearly pulled out of their car when high school students protesting Trump marched on the 101 Freeway waving the flags of Mexico and other Latin American countries. “They should be chill,” Gloria said. “Mother! What ICE is doing is very violent!” Brittney replied. “It’s insane to say we [pro-immigrant activists] should be the ones to chill out.” “Fine,\" her mother agreed. \"Both sides should be chill.” Brittney shrugged. “No lie on that one.” I concluded my visit with the Valles ladies by asking why it’s important for politically split families to not reject each other. Gloria pointed to the wall beside her. High school graduation portraits of her, Jaime and their four children hung on the wall. “If we had a world where everyone agreed on everything, it would be boring. I don’t expect my kids to be like me and my husband. My kids, we trust them.\" She then looked at Brittney. “You shouldn’t lose out on your child’s life because you’re not the same politics. You’ll miss out and regret it.”","summary":"Split on Trump, this family provides a glimpse of how Latino politics have evolved over the decades as well as the power of patience with those you love.","url":"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-12-05/latino-families-trump","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5e4d66a/2147483647/strip/false/crop/5742x3828+0+0/resize/1486x991!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F35%2F8e%2F49618a4b4769b4fe757dfce3e082%2F1531362-me-arellano-m","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-05 11:00:00","author":"Gustavo Arellano","authors":["Gustavo Arellano"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.324},{"id":385290378,"title":"Joe Rogan mocks Donald Trump for texting like a ‘79-year-old kid’","text":"Joe Rogan mocked Donald Trump for texting like a “79-year-old kid” in his latest sideswipe at the president, whom he endorsed just 12 months ago. \n\nRogan revealed that the president also uses the “big” iMessage effect, which causes texts to expand to fill the receiver’s screen. \n\nThe podcaster revealed Trump’s quirky habits while speaking to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang on Wednesday’s episode of the Joe Rogan Experience, miming the texts swelling in size as he said, “He makes the text go big.”\n\n“Like ‘USA is RESPECTED again,’ all caps, and it makes the text enlarge. It’s kind of ridiculous,” Rogan added.\n\nHe also described the president as an “odd guy” who is “very different” from how people perceive him publicly. \n\nDuring the 2024 presidential campaign, Rogan praised Trump constantly and claimed that many of the United States’ most famous celebrities “thanked” him privately for doing so. \n\nTrump even appeared on Rogan’s podcast for a three-hour interview, which racked up 38 million views in three days. \n\nKamala Harris did not appear on the podcast, though, despite claiming to have repeatedly tried to set up an interview with Rogan. \n\nHowever, Rogan’s relationship with the commander-in-chief has seemingly turned sour in recent months, with the podcaster criticizing the president for his hardline crackdown on immigration into the United States. \n\nRogan described the president’s raids on workers as “f***ing nuts” and argued that ICE agents should focus on catching drug dealers and cartel members, instead of migrant workers. \n\nHe has also criticized Trump’s claim that the 2020 election was fraudulent and rigged by former President Joe Biden, despite previously allowing the current president to ramble about his conspiracy theory during his 2024 appearance on the podcast.\n\nIn 2024, Rogan seemingly sympathized with Trump’s claim, drawing comparisons between doubting the election and being labelled as an “anti-vaxxer if you question some of the health consequences that people have from the Covid-19 shots.”\n\nHowever, as Trump’s own popularity plunges, Rogan has claimed that he does not believe that the president’s administration has “any evidence” that Biden stole the election.\n\n“I don’t think they have any evidence,” Rogan said in August. “I think there’s a lot of speculation and there’s a lot of consideration about mail-in ballots. \n\n“There’s a lot of shenanigans,” Rogan added. “There’s a good record of shenanigans and there’s the reality of any kind of electronics can be hacked.”","summary":"Joe Rogan revealed that Donald Trump also uses a strange texting feature in order to emphasize his points","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/joe-rogan-donald-trump-text-podcast-b2878655.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/11/19/20/59/Screenshot-2025-11-19-at-3-50-52-PM.png?crop=2473.5,1649,x240.8,y0&trim=0,214,0,240&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/bT1jpKUa-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-12-05 10:32:19","author":"Owen Scott","authors":["Owen Scott"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.079},{"id":385273564,"title":"Biden’s EV boondoggles","text":"For you non-math majors, that comes out to a cost of just under $5 million per electric truck. How’s that for a bargain?\n\nTRUMP TO ANNOUNCE NEW FUEL STANDARDS, REVERSING BIDEN-ERA RULES\n\nThat is not quite fair, as the USPS also now has nearly 9,000 electric vans that can also help deliver mail. However, nearly 7,000 of those are doing nothing because they can’t cover the routes that the electric trucks were designed to cover — money well spent.\n\nThis may remind you of a similar multibillion-dollar EV-related dud, when Biden allocated $7.5 billion to build “tens of thousands of electric vehicle chargers across the country” under his 2021 infrastructure law. Two years in, the program built zero new charging ports. Two years later, we now have a total of 384 ports at 68 charging stations, a total of one charging port for every $19.5 million spent.\n\nBiden even threatened during his term to make people pay more money for his EV climate dreams in the form of EV mandates. His administration wanted to mandate that half of all new cars sold by 2030 be EVs, artificially restricting the supply of gas-powered vehicles and forcing people to buy more expensive EVs, with car manufacturers knowing they would not have a choice otherwise. Biden intended to increase that percentage to 67% by 2032.\n\nHOW CONGRESS, THE COURTS, AND TRUMP FREED DRIVERS FROM THE EV MANDATE\n\nBiden was not alone in this mission. Former Vice President Kamala Harris was even more authoritarian when it came to climate policy. In 2019, she co-sponsored a bill that would have banned the sale of new gas cars (and gas and EV hybrid cars) by the year 2040. Much like her home state of California, Harris wanted to force people into EVs, which would not have been able to be charged at any of the vacant lots where she and Biden funneled billions of dollars for EV chargers that were never built.\n\nThose billions upon billions of dollars will not come back, and they very clearly will not pay for the promised fleet of trucks or fields of EV chargers that were pitched to voters in the first place. It is yet another way that Biden set Americans back billions of dollars with ambitious promises that he was never going to be competent enough to uphold. Voters should remember this every time their paychecks are delivered by non-EV USPS vehicles with chunks taken out for taxes.","summary":"Former President Joe Biden‘s time in office may be long forgotten by voters (and perhaps by Biden himself), but the nation is still feeling the effects, especially the billions of dollars he wasted in appeasing climate change activists and their delusional panic.

entrepreneur Lucy Guo to become the world’s youngest self-made female billionaire.\n\nLuana Lopes Lara, co-founder of prediction market firm Kalshi, snatched the crown from 31-year-old Scale AI co-founder Guo after the platform hit an $11 billion evaluation and her net worth skyrocketed to $1.3 billion, Forbes announced Tuesday.\n\nGuo held the title of world’s youngest self-made female billionaire since June, when the AI company she co-founded as a 21-year-old put her net worth at $1.3 billion, overtaking Swift, whose popularity from her 2023 Eras tour boosted her past Kylie Jenner.\n\nLopes Lara, a Brazilian native, attended the famed Bolshoi Theater School in Brazil to study ballet before she graduated and moved to Austria to pursue a career as a professional ballerina.\n\nShe stayed in Europe for nine months before trading in her pointe shoes for her thinking cap at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where she studied computer science and met fellow student Tarek Mansour.\n\nLopes Lara and Mansour — who both also worked at hedge fund Citadel — co-founded Kalshi in 2018. In six years, their firm raised $1 billion to achieve a valuation of over $11 billion.\n\nThe two received internships at Five Rings Capital in New York City in 2018, where they hung out at night and came up with the idea for a prediction market business.\n\nDuring their time in Manhattan, the two found many financial decisions were driven by predictions about future events, but there was no “straightforward way” to directly trade on event outcomes, according to Kalshi’s website.\n\nLopes Lara and Mansour spent the COVID pandemic building the company, fighting for federal regulation approval and getting investment from significant companies, including Charles Schwab and Sequoia Capital.\n\n“Right out of college, we were taking on an insane amount of risk. It was two years without a single product — nothing launched — and if we didn’t get regulated, the company would just go to zero,” Lopes Lara said.\n\nIn November 2020, Kalshi received approval from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and was listed on Forbes 30 Under 30 in 2022.\n\nThe company won a lawsuit ahead of the 2024 US presidential election and became the first company to offer legal election contracts.\n\n“We really wanted to do things the right way because our vision was to build the biggest financial exchange in the world,” Lopes Lara said. “Doing it legally was something we couldn’t compromise on.”\n\nUsers bet over $500 million and correctly predicted President Donald Trump would defeat Vice President Kamala Harris in the election.\n\n“It’s actually the best mechanism to get more truth about who’s actually going to win,” Mansour told The Post’s NYNext ahead of the election. “We’re letting the market speak instead of pundits, pollsters, people, political figures, people with biases or conflicts of interest, people that had incentives or not.”\n\nKalshi bills itself as “the world’s largest global prediction market company.”\n\nThe two 29-year-olds each own an estimated 12 percent of the company — pegging their net worths at $1.3 billion each.\n\nKalshi ranks above its main competitor, Polymarket, which has a valuation of $9 billion, according to Forbes.\n\nCNN recently inked a deal with Kalshi that will inject real-time prediction market probabilities into the network’s coverage across TV, digital and streaming.\n\nCNN will display the data through a real-time ticker on air and allow anchors and correspondents to reference Kalshi probabilities across its platforms when discussing political, cultural, news and weather forecasts, according to Axios.\n\nThe company is seeking to become the “most authoritative source of information about the real-time probabilities of major cultural and political future events,” Mansour said.\n\nThe 35-year-old “Life of a Showgirl” pop star is currently worth $1.6 billion, ahead of Guo’s $1.25 billion. Jenner lost her billionaire status after Forbes claimed her company, Kylie Cosmetics, inflated its income to spark the billion-dollar valuation, Axios reported.\n\nJenner, 28, is currently estimated to be worth $670 million.","summary":"A former ballerina and MIT graduate made history, unseating Lucy Guo, Taylor Swift and Kylie Jenner to become the world's youngest self-made female billionaire.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/12/05/business/kalshi-co-founder-luana-lopes-lara-29-becomes-youngest-self-made-female-billionaire-passing-taylor-swift-and-ai-founder-lucy-guo/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/newspress-collage-kfqr2hgvp-1764915770938.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1764897817&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/tdTZFJQq-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-12-05 07:47:36","author":"Nicholas McEntyre","authors":["Nicholas McEntyre"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":0.151}]}
