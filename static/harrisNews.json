Gloria Johnson emerged the victor in Tennessee’s closely watched Democratic Senate primary and will take on incumbent Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn in November’s election. Johnson took home the victory by garnering 74% of the vote over challengers Marquita Bradshaw, Civil Miller-Watkins and Lola Brown, at the time the race was called by the Associated Press Thursday night. KAMALA HARRIS EYES GOVERNORS FROM BATTLEGROUND STATES AS POSSIBLE VP PICKS The race garnered interest from Democrats nationwide after Johnson, who was seen as the front-runner in the race, attracted widespread attention last year by staging a protest on the floor of the Republican-controlled state House in the aftermath of a deadly shooting at a Tennessee elementary school. Johnson’s protest was joined by two other lawmakers, state Reps. Justin Pearson and Justin Jones, both Democrats, who together became known as the \"Tennessee Three.\" Pearson and Jones were both expelled for violating House rules after the protest, though they were later reappointed. Johnson’s toughest primary challenger was thought to be Bradshaw, an environmental activist who secured the party’s nomination in 2020 before being soundly defeated by incumbent Republican Sen.

Democrats expressed new outrage this week at the former president’s derisive and false charge that Vice President Kamala Harris, who is of Jamaican and Indian heritage, only recently “turned Black” for political gain. Some Republicans — even from within Trump’s own campaign — seemed to distance themselves from the comment. But Trump’s rhetoric this week, and his record on race since he entered politics nearly a decade ago, indicate that divisive attacks on race may emerge as a core GOP argument in the three-month sprint to Election Day — whether his allies want them to or not. A Trump adviser, granted anonymity Thursday to discuss internal strategy, said the campaign doesn’t need to focus on “identity politics” because the case against Harris is that she is “so liberal it’s dangerous.” The adviser pointed to Harris’ record on the Southern border, crime, the economy and foreign policy. In a sign that Trump may not be coordinating his message with his own team, the Republican presidential nominee doubled down on the same day with a new attack on Harris’ racial identity. He posted on his social media site a picture of Harris donning traditional Indian attire in a family photo. Sen. Cynthia Lummis, a Wyoming Republican who has endorsed Trump, was among a number of lawmakers on Capitol Hill who said Thursday that the rhetoric around race and identity is not “helpful to anyone” this election cycle. “People’s skin color doesn’t matter one iota,” Lummis said in an interview. Trump turned to an old tactic against Harris It’s been less than two weeks after President Joe Biden ended his reelection bid and endorsed Harris. Trump has had to pivot from campaigning against an 81-year-old white president showing signs of decline to facing a 59-year-old biracial vice president who is drawing much larger crowds and new enthusiasm from Democratic donors. Trump went to the National Association of Black Journalists convention on Wednesday. In an appearance carried live on cable news and shared widely online, he falsely suggested Harris misled voters about her race. “I didn’t know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black and now she wants to be known as Black. So, I don’t know, is she Indian or is she Black?” Trump said Wednesday. At a Pennsylvania rally hours later, Trump’s team displayed years-old news headlines describing Harris as the “first Indian-American senator” on the big screen in the arena. And Ohio Sen. JD Vance, Trump’s running mate, told reporters traveling with him that Harris was a “chameleon” who changed her identity when convenient. Harris attended Howard University, the historically Black institution where she pledged the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority, and has often talked throughout her career about being both about being Black and Indian American. Some Republicans argued that Trump’s message on race is part of a broader pitch that may appeal to some Black voters. “We’re focused on policy and how we can actually make waves and changes in the Black community. Economics, education, inflation, lowering costs. That’s what the message is,” said Diante Johnson, president of the Black Conservative Federation, which supports Trump’s efforts to win over more Black voters and hosted him at a gala in February. Veteran Republican pollster Frank Luntz said he explored the issue during a Wednesday focus group with swing voters almost immediately after Trump’s interview. He found that Harris may be vulnerable to criticism based on her gender, but race-based attacks could hurt Trump among the voters that matter most this fall. Much has changed, Luntz said, since Trump rose to prominence by questioning the citizenship of Barack Obama, the nation’s first Black president. “Trump seems to think that he can criticize her for how she’s dealt with her race. Well, no one’s listening to that criticism. It simply doesn’t matter,” Luntz said. “If it’s racially driven, it will backfire.” Eugene Craig, the former vice chair of the Maryland Republican Party, said that Trump “got what he wanted” at the NABJ convention but that the substance of his argument risked being more offensive than appealing. “The one thing that Black folks will never tolerate is disrespecting Blackness, and that goes for Black Republicans too,” said Craig, who is Black and worked as a staffer for conservative pundit Dan Bongino’s 2012 Senate campaign. He is now supporting Harris. Trump has a long history of racist attacks Trump has frequently used race to go after his opponents since he stepped into presidential politics nearly a decade ago. Trump was perhaps the most famous member of the so-called “birther” movement questioning where Obama was born. He kicked off his first campaign by casting Mexican immigrants as “rapists” and drug traffickers and later questioned whether a U.S. federal judge of Mexican heritage could be fair to him. While in the White House, Trump defended a white supremacist march in Charlottesville, Virginia, and suggested that the U.S. stop accepting immigrants from “shithole” countries including Haiti and parts of Africa. In August 2020, he suggested Harris, who was born in California, might not meet the Constitution’s eligibility requirements to be vice president. And just two weeks after formally entering the 2024 campaign, he dined with notorious white supremacist Nick Fuentes at his Mar-a-Lago residence. Trump won in 2016 but lost reelection in 2020 to Biden by close margins in several swing states. He swept the 2024 Republican primary even while facing a raft of criminal charges. “I hope Trump’s attacks on Harris are just him flailing about ineffectively. But put together Trump’s shamelessness, his willingness to lie, his demagogic talent, and the issue of race — and a certain amount of liberal complacency that Trump is just foolish — and I’m concerned,” Bill Kristol, a leading conservative anti-Trump voice, posted on social media Thursday. The Harris campaign thinks there’s little upside for Trump A Harris adviser described the moment as an opportunity to remind voters of the chaos and division that Trump breeds. But the adviser, granted anonymity to discuss internal strategy, said it would be a mistake for Democrats to engage with Trump’s attacks on race at the expense of the campaign’s broader focus on key policies. So long as the campaign does not get distracted, the adviser said, Harris’ team believes there is little political upside for Trump to continue attacking Harris’ racial identity. Harris told a gathering of a historically Black sorority on Wednesday that Trump’s attack was “the same old show: the divisiveness and the disrespect.” On the ground in at least one swing state, however, there were signs that Trump’s approach may be resonating — at least among the former president’s white male base. Jim Abel, a 65-year-old retiree who attended a rally for Vance in Arizona on Wednesday, said he agreed with Trump’s focus on Harris’ racial identity. “She’s not Black,” Abel said. “I’ve seen her parents. I’ve pictures of her and her family and she’s not Black. She’s looking for the Black vote.” But several high-profile Republican voices disagreed. Conservative commentator Ben Shapiro posted on X a picture of a road sign with two directions. One led to, “Attack Kamala’s record, lies and radicalism,” while the other, “Is she really black?” “I dunno guys, I just think that maybe winning the 2024 election might be more important than having this silly and meaningless conversation,” Shapiro wrote. ___ Brown reported from Chicago. AP writers Stephen Groves, Mary Clare Jalonick and Farnoush Amiri in Washington; and Gabriel Sandoval in Glendale, Arizona, contributed to this report.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nNEW YORK – Donald Trump has found tremendous success from the very&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump focuses on Harris&#8217; race in his 2024 campaign, despite Republican preferences first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/trump-focuses-on-harris-race-in-his-2024-campaign-despite-republican-preferences/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rewrite-this-title-Trump-is-making-his-2024-campaign-about.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-01 23:55:01","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.108},{"id":253187510,"title":"What was Harris' role in prisoner swap with Russia?","text":"What was Harris' role in prisoner swap with Russia?

The precipitious decline is due to the changing value of Trump’s stake in Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG), the parent company of his Twitter clone Truth Social. Trump has over 114m shares in TMTG, whose value has declined 23 percent since July 21, from $4bn to about $3.1bn, according to CNN. TMTG stock has often served as a stand-in for Trump’s political fortunes, declining during his hush money trial, then spiking when he bested Joe Biden at the debates and bumping up again when he survived an assassination attempt. The latest plunge follows a season of bad news for TMTG. The platform has suffered some of its worst-ever audience numbers as of late, according to a media analysis. In June, the site had just over 2.11m unique visitors down 38 percent compared to the same period last year. It is the second lowest site traffic has dipped since June 2022, when Truth Social attracted 1.8 million visitors, according to Howard Polskin, of media monitoring firm TheRighting, who based his analysis on Comscore data. And it’s a world away from the site’s more than 3.2 million visitors upon launch in February of 2022. “The diminishing audience levels for Truth Social suggest a rejection of the harsh rhetoric expressed by the ex-president and his political allies that is one of the hallmarks of the two-year-old platform,” Polskin told The Guardian. “If this softness persists, it might portend trouble for Mr Trump at the ballot box in November,” he added. That hasn’t stopped the company from continuing to try and grow Truth Social. Earlier this month, it announced its first major purchase, of technology that would help stream TV on Truth Social. One of the companies involved in the deal is JedTech LLC, a Louisiana-based firm controlled by James E Davison, a major Republican donor with business interests impacted by the federal government, according to ProPublica.","summary":"Truth Social has experienced declining audience numbers too","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-net-worth-truth-social-b2589954.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/07/31/19/SEI215154435.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/nRdT7ePM-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-01 23:48:25","author":"Josh Marcus","authors":["Josh Marcus"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.374},{"id":253186952,"title":"Deadline nears for Harris to make VP pick","text":"Deadline nears for Harris to make VP pick Vice President Kamala is facing the biggest decision yet of her presidential campaign, who to pick as a running mate.

The decision by the Appellate Division in Manhattan means the Republican presidential nominee cannot comment publicly about individual prosecutors and others in the case until Justice Juan Merchan sentences him on Sept. 18, seven weeks before the Nov. 5 election. Trump’s lawyers have argued that the gag order violated Trump’s constitutional free speech rights under the First Amendment. “The gag order is blatantly un-American,” Steven Cheung, a spokesperson for Trump’s campaign, said in a statement. A Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Tuesday showed Trump locked in a tight race with Vice President Kamala Harris, who is poised to become the Democratic nominee. Harris led Trump 43%-42% among registered voters, within the margin of error. On Thursday afternoon, Trump’s lawyers renewed their demand that Merchan recuse himself, citing his daughter’s work as a Democratic political consultant and her “long-standing” relationship with Harris. They also said the “unjust and unconstitutional” gag order restricts Trump’s ability to respond to Harris, saying she framed her candidacy as that of “prosecutor vs convicted felon.” Harris served as California’s attorney general earlier in her career. Merchan rejected a similar recusal request by Trump before the trial began, and another recusal request last year. The judge imposed the gag order a few weeks before the trial began on April 22, saying Trump’s history of making threatening statements could undermine the proceedings. Merchan’s original order prevented Trump from commenting on prosecutors, court staff, witnesses and jurors. A separate order against naming the anonymous jurors remains in effect. Merchan lifted the restrictions on witnesses and jurors following Trump’s May 30 conviction. The Appellate Division, a mid-level appeals court, said threats that Bragg’s staff received in the wake of the verdict continue to pose a “significant and immediate” threat. “Justice Merchan did not act in excess of jurisdiction by maintaining the narrowly tailored protections,” the five-judge panel said. The appeals court upheld Merchan’s original gag order in May, citing the need to protect people from “threats, intimidation, harassment, and harm,” and rejecting Trump’s First Amendment argument. The order leaves Trump free to speak about Bragg and Merchan. Jurors found Trump guilty on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, for covering up former personal lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen’s $130,000 payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels. The payment was made in exchange for Daniels’ silence before the 2016 election about a sexual encounter she says she had with Trump a decade earlier, which Trump denied.

The moment of levity occurred before Biden’s first public appearance since he dropped out of the race, according to The Washington Post. When he landed in Austin, Texas, Biden was met with uproarious applause, upon resurfacing after what many pegged as a career-ending chain of events. Now Harris is the heir apparent – a fact that Biden has seemingly taken in stride despite showing hesitance initially. ‘I didn’t sense any regret at all,’ said Al Sharpton, who had been aboard the plane at the time. ‘He’s made his decision. He’s at peace with it,’ Sharpton continued. ‘I sensed a man at peace with where he is and trying to move forward.’ ‘He is reflecting,’ added National Urban League boss Marc Morial, who accompanied Biden all day Monday. ‘He’s in a reflective mood,’ he went on. ‘It’s very natural and very human to be in such a reflective mood after such a long and unique career. ‘Try to think of who has had a career of such length and breadth,’ he continued, referencing how the politician assumed his post on the New Castle County Council in Delaware way back in 1970 ‘I have trouble thinking of anyone else, because he got elected so young,’ he said. That career will inevitably come to a close in six months when a new candidate takes the reins, as Biden continues to come to terms with the situation. Those close to the president told the Post that process has been surprisingly streamlined, as Democrats champion Harris to challenge Trump, with Biden himself offering his official endorsement. Big names like the Obamas have followed suit, and the vice president’s burgeoning campaign is quickly picking up steam. This week, CBS News obtained a firsthand account from Austin Rep. Lloyd Doggett, who was there when Air Force One landed in his city Monday. He was the third person who greeted Biden on the tarmac, after weeks earlier becoming the first sitting Democrat to beg him to drop his reelection bid. ‘Thank you for suggesting it,’ Biden reportedly told him, in a non-combative tone as Doggett thanked him for bowing out. Rep. James E. Clyburn, one of Biden’s biggest political allies, also spoke favorably of how the commander-in-chief is doing, revealing the 81-year-old is already looking to the future. ‘He was particularly focused on where to go from here,’ the South Carolina rep told The Post of Biden’s attitude Monday on Air Force One. ‘Martin Luther King’s last book was Where Do We Go From Here, Chaos or Community? That’s pretty much where we are today,’ he continued. ‘Are we going to have chaos going forward or community going forward? That’s what’s on the president’s mind more than anything else.’ ‘I think he’s looking at these six months as determined to prove his legacy by winning this election and being able to finish things he started,’ Sharpton added. ‘I definitely think he’s now seeing himself in historic terms rather than tomorrow’s newspaper or this evening’s TV show.’ The election, as of writing, is 96 days away. As of Thursday, Harris – not yet the official Democrat nominee – has yet to declare a running mate.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nJoe Biden was riding aboard Air Force One with civil rights leaders last&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Biden&#8217;s True Sentiments on Being Pressured to Withdraw from 2024 Race and Kamala&#8217;s Role first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/bidens-true-sentiments-on-being-pressured-to-withdraw-from-2024-race-and-kamalas-role/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rewrite-this-title-How-Biden-REALLY-feels-about-being-forced.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-01 23:47:06","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.021},{"id":253186904,"title":"Vance border speech hits Harris in latest barrage of attacks between campaigns on migrant crisis","text":"The crisis at the southern border has become a centerpiece of the 2024 presidential race, as GOP vice presidential candidate Sen. JD Vance of Ohio hit out at Vice President Kamala Harris at the border on Thursday over her handling of the crisis — days after her campaign sought to draw a contrast between her and former President Trump on the hot-button issue. \"It's hard to believe until you see it with your own eyes, just how bad the policies of the Kamala Harris administration have been when it comes to the southern border,\" Vance said in Cochise County, Arizona. \"They started their administration, Kamala Harris came into office... they stopped deportations on day one. They stopped construction of the border wall.\" Vance tapped into Republican arguments about how the Biden administration ended what they see as successful Trump-era policies and unleashed havoc at the border. 2024 SHOWDOWN: TRUMP CAMPAIGN REJOICES AFTER HARRIS LEANS IN ON KEY ISSUE HAUNTING HER VICE PRESIDENCY \"We see the border wall sitting here, ready to be completed behind us. And that can't happen because of Kamala Harris' administration. They reinstated catch-and-release and they stopped Remain in Mexico,\" he continued. \"So all these asylum claimants who come to our border, they can now get released into our country because they're not forced to stay in Mexico while we adjudicate their asylum claims.\" Vance also described securing the border as \"not rocket science.\" \"You just have to re-implement some commonsense policies. You've got to re-implement Remain in Mexico. You've got to stop catch-and-release,\" he said. \"You've got to force these asylum seekers to stay in Mexico while their claims are being adjudicated. And you've got to finish this border wall and re-implement deportations.\" Vance’s border visit came after former President Trump also said he will visit the border before November, potentially multiple times. Republicans have hammered Harris on the southern border, given not only the crisis there but Harris’ leadership in international diplomacy on root causes, which led to her being dubbed the \"border czar\" by the media and Republicans. But Harris has pushed back, highlighting an endorsement by a group of mayors in Arizona border towns \"praising her long record of fighting to secure the border and fix our broken immigration system, including her work going after transnational gangs smuggling weapons and drugs as California Attorney General and bringing border crossings to their lowest level in years with tough border policies in the White House.\" This week, Harris released an ad contrasting her support of a bipartisan border package unveiled in the Senate which would have increased border funding and placed some limits on entries into the U.S. The Biden administration has said it would help tackle the border crisis, but Trump and his allies killed it off. FLASHBACK: HARRIS FUMED AT AMERICANS FOR SAYING ‘MERRY CHRISTMAS’ BEFORE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS GOT PROTECTIONS The video argued that Harris \"helped lead the way to record low border crossings and has spent her entire career keeping our communities safe,\" and charged that Trump \"sided with drug traffickers and the cartels to block the strongest, fairest reforms to secure the border in decades.\" The Trump campaign instantly pilloried the video. \"Every statement in Kamala’s border ad is an absolute lie. The truth is that President Trump handed the most secure border in history to the Biden-Harris Administration, and they opened it up by erasing every one of his good policies,\" the Trump campaign charged. \"As Border Czar, Kamala Harris has overseen the worst immigration crisis in American history, enabling drug cartels to smuggle deadly fentanyl across our border and allowing more than 11 million illegal criminals and terrorists from all over the world to enter our country.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF THE BORDER SECURITY CRISIS Harris criticized Trump at a rally in Atlanta earlier this week, saying he \"has been talking a big game about securing our border, but he does not walk the walk.\" She charged that the former president \"tanked the bipartisan deal because he thought it would help him win an election\" and pledged that \"as the president I will bring back the border security bill that Donald Trump killed.\" After Vance’s speech on Thursday, Harris' campaign took aim at both Trump and Vance. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Donald Trump and JD Vance are not offering Americans solutions — only insults, chaos, and fear. They don’t want security at our border, they want to spread fear. They don’t want to help working families, their Project 2025 agenda only hurts them,\" Harris for President spokesperson James Singer said. Fox News' Greg Norman and Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.","summary":"Sen.

She is the present Vice President of the country, married to a Jew, and step mother to an adult son and daughter. Most significantly she is now the accepted-by-Democratic Party contender for the presidential elections scheduled for November, pitting herself against Donald Trump who was soaring high against Biden – showing signs of aging, slowing down and making mistakes in speech. Trump has been stumped, thank goodness we say, even though we are miles away and need not have vested interests in American politics. At least, it will save one Sri Lankan woman from migrating to Britain which she threatened to do if Trump became Prez of the USA again. Women power or feminine power has emerged mightily in America. This power is a force that has been assured Kamala Harris after being endorsed by retiring Biden to contest to be President. Many powerful Democrats including the Clintons and Obamas endorsed her. Now, within this pair are two powerful women so Harris has the support of Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama. But more importantly. Kamala has been fully endorsed by Nancy Pelosi. No sooner had Joe Biden announced his endorsement of Kamala Harris to become the 47th President of the United States of America with his stepping out of the race on July 21, former Speaker of the House than Nancy Pelosi followed suit in a strong voice. She was soon discerned as the power behind Harris’ bid. Pelosi had been instrumental in a behind-the-scenes campaign to have Biden step aside. She then endorsed Harris with, as she announced, “immense pride and limitless optimism for our country’s future.” She added that her support was “official, personal and political,” Other endorsements came in thick and fast as did donations to the campaign fund. Three possible contenders for the post of President, Governors Gretchen Whitmer, Michigan; J B Pritsker of Illinois and Andy Beshear of Delaware backed Harris. At her first appearance to fete Biden, she referred to his presidency as a “legacy of accomplishment unmatched in modern history.” It was interesting to watch her reception to visiting Israeli PM Netanyahu. Biden smiled and warmly greeted the Head of Israel as an old buddy and again promised aid to Israel. Kamala Harris showed less warmth and much less support. She also mentioned the fact that horrors of war could not be overlooked. Said she in an interview: “I also expressed with the prime minister my serious concern about the scale of human suffering in Gaza, including the death of far too many innocent civilians.” Of course, she had to be very civil to Netanyahu and not offend Jews, but she, as Cass said before, gives a glimmer of hope for the Palestinians. Wondering about her religion, Cass googled and found she is a Baptist with faith that traces back to Martin Luther King and Gandhi. Her mother would have been a Hindu and her father is an Anglican Christian. Her husband probably follows the Jewish faith. So, let’s hope Kamala Harris wins the presidency of the US of A, a great honour to women around the world. Though not openly sexist, Harris has shown she is sympathetic to women’s issues. She seems to be against the SC’s putting aside Roe V Wade and thus stamping down on women’s right to abortion. Re-elected Another outstanding woman is the re-elected President of the European Union – Ursula Gertrude von der Leyen – serving as the 13th Prez of the EU since 2019. She served in the German federal government between 2005 and 2019, holding positions in Angela Merkel’s cabinet, lastly as Federal Minister of Defence. Cass read when Merkel resigned that Ursula von der Leyen was tipped to be the next German Chancellor but preferred her post as head of the EU. Born in 1958, she higher studied in the London School of Economics – 1978 and followed a medical course in the Hanover Medical School graduating in 1987. Married to a medical physician, the pair have seven, yes, seven children. She is outstandingly beautiful, composed, and though more sedate and restrained, is regal in posture and manner. Unfortunate Leader The travails of Aung San Suu Kyi have been long, included tragedies, separation from husband and two sons, and imprisonment. Born in 1945 to national hero father Aung San and wise mother Khin Kyi, she studied in New Delhi both secondary and higher at the University of Delhi till 1964, then proceeded to London and joined St Hugh’s College, Oxford, graduating in 1968. She joined the UN in New York while her fiancee Dr Michael Aris was in Bhutan; a keen student of Tibetan language, Buddhism and culture. Married in 1972, they settled in UK and had two sons. She joined SOAS to follow a doctorate course. In 1988 she returned alone to Myanmar to care for her ill mother. She stayed on joining and then leading the National League for Democracy (NLD). Her party won the parliamentary election in 1989 but was not allowed to form a government by the military government which names itself the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC). She suffered house arrest for three decades -1989 to 2010, then won an election in 2016 and was appointed State Counsellor of Myanmar, equal to Prime Minister. In 19 91 she won the Nobel Prize for Peace. Her life continued to be wrought with troubles and tragedies. Her husband suffering terminal cancer was not given a visa to enter Myanmar though world leaders appealed for this. The SPDC said she could go but Suu Kyi sacrificed her spending time with her husband and sons because she suspected this to be a ruse to get her out of the country and not allow returning. Another problem faced by her was world censure on her personally for allowing the genocide of the Rohingyar in Rakhine State. She even had to appear before the International Court of Justice in the Hague in 2019. But her hands were tied. She could not act counter to the military. After elections in November 2020 when her party again won a landslide victory, she was arrested in 2021 and several charges leveled against her of corruption, inciting violence etc. She was convicted several times adding up to 33 years in prison, reduced to 27. She is now under house arrest, said to be because she is ill. Cass listened to a YouTube interview with her elder son, ponytailed and unimpressive, saying he was spearheading her full release since she is very ill. No definite news is out about her condition, delicate and frail as she looks. She’s proved to be hero and martyr for her country like her father who is named The Father of the Nation.

Namal Rajapaksa has been referred to as Namal Baba even in press editorials, cultivating his face to resemble his father’s and emerging to the limelight; however, Cass surmises too protective of himself to be a candidate in September 21 elections. He sure will be up front in 2029/30. Our women? There are one or two good women politicians in parliament but no one in the political firmament.

She suffered house arrest for three decades -1989 to 2010, then won an election in 2016 and was appointed State Counsellor of Myanmar, equal to Prime Minister. In 19 91 she won the Nobel Prize for Peace. Her life continued to be wrought with troubles and tragedies. Her husband suffering terminal cancer was not given a visa to enter Myanmar though world leaders appealed for this. The SPDC said she could go but Suu Kyi sacrificed her spending time with her husband and sons because she suspected this to be a ruse to get her out of the country and not allow returning. Another problem faced by her was world censure on her personally for allowing the genocide of the Rohingyar in Rakhine State. She even had to appear before the International Court of Justice in the Hague in 2019. But her hands were tied. She could not act counter to the military. After elections in November 2020 when her party again won a landslide victory, she was arrested in 2021 and several charges leveled against her of corruption, inciting violence etc. She was convicted several times adding up to 33 years in prison, reduced to 27. She is now under house arrest, said to be because she is ill. Cass listened to a YouTube interview with her elder son, ponytailed and unimpressive, saying he was spearheading her full release since she is very ill. No definite news is out about her condition, delicate and frail as she looks. She’s proved to be hero and martyr for her country like her father who is named The Father of the Nation. Local It’s still full preoccupation with presidential elections; who joins which Party and the SLPP deciding not to support independent candidate Ranil Wickremesinghe. Namal Rajapaksa has been referred to as Namal Baba even in press editorials, cultivating his face to resemble his father’s and emerging to the limelight; however, Cass surmises too protective of himself to be a candidate in September 21 elections. He sure will be up front in 2029/30. Our women? There are one or two good women politicians in parliament but no one in the political firmament. Hirunika is on the fringe in spite of her spending a couple of days in prison for the offence of abduction. Notwithstanding, Cassandra places bets on Hirunika becoming a leader in this country. She demonstrated woman power in her active criticism of Prez Gotabaya. What is brightest is the honour brought to our country by sports women. Our cricket team led by Chamari Athapaththu won the Asian cricket cup recently. Not for them glamour and panache and vanity, displayed recently by some male cricketers; and losing games. The women, as is wont, train hard and play the game as it should be played. Our two women athletes at the Olympics may not win medals but them qualifying to compete is honour enough. Congrats and thanks to all of them!","summary":"By Lalin I De Silva In Sri Lanka, adverse possession allows an individual to claim ownership of land after occupying it openly, continuously, and without the owner&#8217;s permission for a period of typically 10 years.

Once the FTC votes to authorize the study, major grocery chains would be ordered to provide information on the costs and prices of common products. Khan made the announcement at a public meeting with Justice Department officials on pricing practices. The biggest U.S. industry players include Walmart; club grocery chain Costco Wholesale Corp; Amazon.com, which operates Whole Foods; and big box retailer Target. Food prices have risen 25% between 2019 and 2023, faster than other consumer goods and services, U.S. Department of Agriculture statistics showed. An FTC study showed food prices for U.S. consumers rose 11% between 2021 and 2022, while profits for food retailers went up more than 6%. “We want to make sure that major businesses are not exploiting their power to inflate prices for American families at the grocery store,” Khan said. The FTC has played a major role in the Biden administration’s efforts to cut costs for U.S. households, targeting high prices and junk fees on products and services ranging from airfare to credit cards. Billionaire Democratic donors, some affiliated with businesses the FTC has sued, have urged Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, to replace Khan if elected. The agency last week launched an inquiry into services that could let companies set different prices based on the shopper’s personal information. The FTC earlier this year sued to block Kroger’s acquisition of smaller grocery store rival Albertsons, citing concerns the deal would hike prices for millions of Americans.","summary":"The Federal Trade Commission will probe why grocery prices remain high even as costs for retailers fall, Chair Lina Khan said today, a key theme for the Biden-Harris administration as it heads towards the presidential election.","url":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2024/08/01/breaking-news/ftc-targets-surging-grocery-prices-in-latest-probe/","image":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/web1_20240801_brk_gro01.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-01 23:45:00","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.128},{"id":253187026,"title":"Billie Eilish tells Charli XCX ‘I’d hit it’ on ‘Guess’ remix","text":"Just when you thought Brat summer couldn’t get any bigger, Charli XCX released the remix for “Guess” featuring Billie Eilish on Thursday (August 1). In an accompanying music video directed by Aidan Zamiri, the two pop stars climb a mountain of lingerie, playing off Charli’s lyrics: “You wanna guess the colour of my underwear.” Eilish enters the video driving a forklift, smashing through the wall of a room where Charli is hosting a wild party with revelers in – you guessed it – their underwear. During her verse, Eilish sings: “Charli likes boys, but she knows I’d hit it. Charli, call me if you’re with it.” On the outro, the pair tease: “You wanna guess what me and Billie have been texting about... You wanna guess if I’m serious about this song.” In the comments section, fans reacted to Eilish’s flirtatious lyrics with one writing: “THE SMILE CHARLI DOES WHEN BILLIE SAYS THE CHARLI LIKES BOYS BUT SHE KNOW I'D HIT IT LINE I'M SCREAMING.” ““Charli likes boys but she knows id hit it’ LIKE BILLIE AHHHH,” said another. The new video arrives less than a week after the “Ocean Eyes” singer left fans blushing with her appearance on Amelia Dimoldenberg’s Chicken Shop Date web series. Since its release on June 7, Charli’s latest album Brat has generated one of the defining moods of 2024, capturing an attitude that rejects other TikTok-friendly trends such as “clean girl living” and instead embracing a messier, more hedonistic outlook. “You’re just like that girl who is a little messy and likes to party and maybe says some dumb things sometimes,” Charli explained in a clip on TikTok. “Who feels like herself but maybe also has a breakdown. But kind of like parties through it, is very honest, very blunt. A little bit volatile. Like, does dumb things. But it’s brat. You’re brat. That’s brat.” The trend has been co-opted by new Democrat nominee Kamala Harris, as she looks to woo the cynical Gen Z vote with memes and TikToks ahead of the US election in November. Charli endorsed the presidential candidate last week, writing on X/Twitter: “Kamala IS Brat.” Reviewing for The Independent, critic Helen Brown praised Charli XCX for untangling the contradictions of her “cult classic” status. “BRAT is a hedonistic, ultraviolet collection of songs whose thumping – slightly disorienting – club beats more than succeed in their aim of ‘capturing a feeling of chaos’,” she wrote.","summary":"‘Guess’ is the third single from Charli XCX’s wildly popular ‘Brat’ album","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/charli-xcx-billie-eilish-guess-lyrics-b2589949.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/02/00/newFile.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/rEmAbjFS-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-01 23:43:21","author":"Tom Murray","authors":["Tom Murray"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.332},{"id":253186674,"title":"Hip-Hop Group EARTHGANG's Olu Takes His Mental Health Awareness to the Next Level After 200-Plus Hour Yoga Class ","text":"Olu and Doctur Dot formed EARTHGANG after a school field trip in their freshman year of high school — and since then the group has gone on to be honored with their own day in Atlanta. Though the musicians have collected their fair share of musical accolades, their work off the stage has also helped put them on the map. During the COVID-19 pandemic Olu had a realization that while the group had been on an upward trend, he still felt something was missing. “I had just reached a point in my life, in my career where I felt like I had accomplished a lot, but spiritually I hadn't grown as much as I had in the past,” Olu tells PEOPLE. “I think it's because I was focused on the outside and what things look like outside.” This feeling is what pushed Olu to take his 200-plus hour yoga instruction course in Bali rather than locally. “I could have done it here in Atlanta over five weekends, eight weekends and got my 200,” says Olu. “But I was like, nah, I need a complete reset, a complete break. Beautifully enough that the school that I went to really, really focused on blending the Eastern philosophy with the Western world, because a lot of times, we look at yoga as just like, oh, let's do some cool stretching ​​but it's a lifestyle.” While in Bali, Olu decided to create his company COMPXSS, which teaches mindfulness, movement and wellness to his fan base. This decision has opened the doors to not only his fans but also professional teams such as the Toronto Raptors and Memphis Grizzlies, which have reached out for the musicians' teachings. With all the work that Olu and EARTHGANG have put into creating an accessible way for his fans and others to better themselves, he has also worked to form the EARTHGANG Foundation which works to combat environmental injustices through climate and environmental conservation. “We created the foundation in 2022 under our foundation President Dr. Jaz. She has a PhD in environmental science,” says Olu. “She's just been such a blessing for us because as artists, we don't have all of the knowledge, but our role as artists is to be the conduit from our fan base to the people with the knowledge and to the people with the resources, and to create community.” The work in these foundations and business ventures is what allowed the group to receive their own day as well as be invited to Vice President and current Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris’s home to learn about “climate awareness and Indigenous peoples,\" he notes. “That's something that was never on my vision board,” says Olu. “I think we've always just wanted to give back because that's where we come from. We come from community. So even though we have hundreds of thousands of fans across the world, we still want to find a way to build that into a community, and the city recognized us for that, and that was really fire.” Olu and EARTHGANG will be looking ahead to releasing their album, Perfect Fantasy in the coming months, as well as working with other organizations to build the EARTHGANG Foundation.","summary":"The Atlanta-based hip-hop group is continuing its community advocacy through both mental health awareness courses and environmental work","url":"https://people.com/earthgang-olu-takes-mental-health-awareness-next-level-8687124","image":"https://people.com/thmb/vbdK8K3lo40mJQBf1K_PeOpg6WU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(438x238:440x240)/OLU-from-Earthgang-073124-3-3a147dd3282a48b5af2e7f7b6a15fb21.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-01 23:41:38","author":"Matthew Acosta","authors":["Matthew Acosta"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.153},{"id":253187174,"title":"Kamala Harris’ poll surge and Fed rate cut odds deflate ‘Trump trade’","text":"In the 11 days since President Joe Biden declared he wouldn’t seek a second term and Democrats united behind the candidacy of Vice President Harris, strategies seen benefiting from a win by Donald Trump have lost steam. The dollar has stagnated, Treasuries have rallied and Bitcoin has slid. Polls now suggest a dead heat between Harris and Trump in swing states, handing markets a harsh reminder on the risk of betting on political events. Just weeks ago, an assassination attempt and doubts over Biden’s age were seen as helping Trump, who is seen embracing looser fiscal policy, higher trade tariffs and softer financial regulation if he returns to the White House. “We have seen some Trump trades unwinding,” Neeraj Seth, chief investment officer and head of APAC fundamental fixed income at BlackRock, said in a Bloomberg Television on Thursday. “We’ll go back and forth between now and the fifth of November.” The markets aren’t solely reacting to the electoral outlook. Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged this week the central bank could pare rates in September, also pushing investors to favor Treasuries and doubt the dollar. That signaling is likely to annoy Trump, who recently told Bloomberg Businessweek a rate cut just weeks before the vote is something officials “know they shouldn’t be doing.” What Bloomberg’s Strategists Say… “Investors have received a cautionary lesson in the dangers of underestimating how rapidly political landscapes can shift. The more likely outcome, especially with the Fed putting a rate cut on the table for next meeting, is for trades tied to US politics to go to sleep until September ends.” — Garfield Reynolds, MLIV Asia team leader. Click here for more Here’s a rundown of how the Trump trades are faring: Bond Trades Focus in the world’s biggest bond market has recently been more tied to monetary policy then politics. Treasuries rallied to cap a third-straight month of gains in July — the longest winning streak for US bonds in three years — after Powell spoke on Wednesday. That runs counter to one iteration of the Trump trade, which posits the Republican’s return to the White House would likely lead to tax cuts and add to the national debt, casting a shadow over longer-dated Treasuries. However, a favorite way to express that concern, via bets on a steeper yield curve, remains a good play for traders thanks to the Fed’s shift toward cuts. An easing Fed is likely to support a so-called bull steepener, where short-dated Treasuries rally more than bonds with further-out maturities. BlackRock’s Seth sees the Fed policy path as “more important” from a 12-to-18 month time horizon, rather than trying to speculate on where the elections are going. “We are moving toward the easing cycle, that’s unambiguous,” he said. Dollar A gauge of the US dollar has stalled since Biden pulled out of the race. Some traders had been wagering that the dollar would rally into a Trump victory on the premise that it would benefit from a haven bid before the election and then from trade tariffs thereafter. But that bet got a lot more complicated when Trump weighed in last month to argue that a highly-valued greenback is a “tremendous burden” on US companies, and chose strong-dollar skeptic and Ohio Senator JD Vance as his running mate. Roughly two-thirds of respondents to a Bloomberg MLIV Pulse survey conducted between July 22 and 26 said they expected a second term for Trump would ultimately undermine the greenback as the world’s reserve currency. Still, 26% saw the dollar as the best refuge from volatility if he were to win. Given the competing impulses, the Fed’s shift is arguably the more consequential driver for the dollar going forward. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index suffered its worst day in more than two months on Wednesday as Powell confirmed the central bank’s growing bias toward easing. A softer dollar is “the path of least resistance until the election outcome reduces the uncertainty associated with post-election trades,” Steven Englander, head of global G-10 FX research at Standard Chartered, wrote Thursday. Stocks Prison companies GEO Group Inc. and CoreCivic Inc. are expected to benefit in case of a Republican sweep, given Trump’s tough stance on immigration. But their shares have slid since Biden dropped out of the race. By contrast, gun stocks like Smith & Wesson Brands and Sturm Ruger & Co. are faring well so far. Bank stocks — which have been called out as a key potential beneficiary from a Trump administration because of optimism for regulatory relief — have largely held on to their July gains amid the broader market’s rotation trade. Meanwhile, Trump Media & Technology Group Corp., parent of Truth Social, has slumped over 20% since July 21. The stock had seen some wild swings lately among all the election headlines. “What was viewed as a cake walk has become very competitive leading many to question whether the Trump Trade was done a bit premature,” said Peak Capital Management CEO Brian Lockhart. “I expect there to be a lot of ‘noise’ in the markets that will likely mean higher levels of volatility through the election.” China Risk Belying expectations the yuan will be hammered as Trump trades gather momentum, the offshore unit strengthened 1% against the dollar in July — the best performance since November. Recent gains in the yuan have been partly driven by a surge in the yen, with the two currencies increasingly moving in lockstep. Investors agree that Chinese assets remain at risk regardless of who wins the election, though they’ll likely fare worse under Trump. The former president has floated slapping 60% tariffs on imports from China and 10% duties from the rest of the world. Harris may continue existing national security and industrial policy measures directed against the world’s second-largest economy. The developments can favor regions like India and defensive stocks such as Asia REITs, which are less exposed to trade risks and stand to benefit from a lower rate environment, said Ray Sharma-Ong, head of multi-asset investment solutions for Southeast Asia at abrdn. Cryptocurrencies Rising doubt that Trump will get a chance to implement his pro-crypto agenda has undermined Bitcoin in recent days. The original cryptocurrency has become something of a proxy for Trump’s odds of returning to the White House after he pledged to make the US the “crypto capital of the planet and the Bitcoin superpower.” Crypto stocks Coinbase Global Inc., Marathon Digital Holdings Inc. and Riot Platforms Inc. have also fallen since Biden dropped out. Kyle Doane, head of trading at Arca, said some of the recent Bitcoin weakness may be due to Harris “inching up in the polls.” Harris Trade Unlike the Trump trade, strategies associated with a Harris win have been touted less so far. With the expectation that she will inherit Biden administration’s policy stance, market watchers are placing more weight on macro drivers. “We would favor more bullish positioning on Asian equities on unhedged basis if Harris wins, since Harris is unlikely to introduce large inflationary shocks to the global economy,” said Homin Lee, senior macro strategist at Lombard Odier Singapore Ltd. “The core drivers of the ongoing disinflation in the US will be preserved.” For abrdn Plc, the Harris trade has yet to emerge because it’s not clear what the composition of the US Congress will be. “Should we get a blue wave in Congress, we expect the Democrats to push for the reintroduction of their pandemic-era child tax credits and an increase in corporation tax,” Sharma-Ong said. “This will be a drag on the bottom line of corporates, and markets will favor stocks with strong margins.” For some, it’s just too early to play the Harris trade. “Her lead, for now, isn’t due to anything she has done but rather because nothing has been done or initiated, leaving room for optimism to grow,” said Hebe Chen, an analyst at IG Markets in Melbourne.","summary":"Polls now suggest a dead heat between Harris and Trump in swing states, a harsh reminder on the risk of betting on political events.","url":"https://fortune.com/2024/08/01/kamala-harris-poll-surge-fed-rate-cut-trump-trade/","image":"https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2164054795-e1722555574160.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-01 23:41:26","author":"Bloomberg,Carter Johnson,Tania Chen,Winnie Hsu","authors":["Bloomberg","Carter Johnson","Tania Chen","Winnie Hsu"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.017},{"id":253186788,"title":"White House announces new defensive military deployments to aide Israel against Iran, proxies","text":"The White House on Thursday announced new defensive military deployments to help Israel defend itself against Iran and its proxies.

Sheila Jackson Lee as champion of justice","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday lauded Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee as a “fierce champion of justice” at the funeral of the prominent voice on African American and women’s rights within the Democratic Party. Jackson Lee announced in June she had pancreatic cancer and was undergoing treatment. The Texas lawmaker died on July 19, aged 74. Harris was the highest-ranking U.S. official at Jackson Lee’s Houston service, acting as consoler in chief for the 15-term representative who promoted legislation addressing social justice, economic inequality and public health. “To know her was to marvel at her mastery of the legislative process,” said Harris, who is poised to become the Democratic presidential nominee after President Joe Biden quit the race last month. Harris recalled her work with the congresswoman on a bill to recognize “Juneteenth” as a federal holiday commemorating the end of the legal enslavement of Black Americans. She recognized they were both members of Alpha Kappa Alpha, a historically African American sorority for female students at U.S. universities and colleges. The vice president’s rival, Republican Donald Trump, on Wednesday falsely suggested to the country’s largest annual gathering of Black journalists that Harris had previously downplayed her Black heritage. Harris, who is of Indian and Jamaican heritage, has long identified as both Black and Asian. The service at Fallbrook Church included a gospel choir, singers and tributes from fellow Democrats ranging from U.S. Representative Pramila Jayapal to former U.S. President Bill Clinton, who lauded Jackson Lee’s commitment to democracy. She “really believed that we were all created equal,” said the 42nd president. Jackson Lee, a graduate of Yale College and the University of Virginia Law School, was a vocal proponent of police reform in the face of congressional roadblocks after the 2020 police killing of George Floyd, a Black man whose death sparked nationwide protests. Civil rights attorney Ben Crump said she was among the first to support the families of Black people killed by police, ranging from Breonna Taylor to Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown. He was among speakers who said she prepared the ground for Harris to become the first Black woman to be a major party’s presidential candidate. The Reverend Al Sharpton called on the audience to follow in Jackson Lee’s footsteps fighting for criminal and racial justice. “We will fight every bigot and racist whether they’re Black of white or orange,” said Sharpton.","summary":"Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday lauded Rep.

When I saw the July 10 headline about textile waste in China’s landfills, my first reaction was guilt. I’ve made many purchases from fast fashion companies that contribute to this growing waste problem. It feels like every purchase I make worsens the climate crisis and I have little power to fix it. I was able to find hope in a bill in the California Legislature that could reduce wasteful practices in the fashion industry, not only in California but across the globe. The Responsible Textile Recovery Act (Senate Bill 707) would establish regulations that hold clothing companies responsible for creating a statewide textile recycling program to divert their garments from entering landfills. This bill can change the entire fashion industry because it sets a precedent for similar legislation across the globe. As Californians, we have the opportunity to initiate a sustainable fashion movement by calling on our representatives to pass SB 707. Radha Feist Berkeley Promoting vaccines overseas protects U.S. Re: “U.S. must honor vaccination promise” (Page A6, July 26). Ricardo Narvaez’s recent letter about vaccines makes an excellent point about their value. An abundance of air travel to anywhere in the world is making our planet seem smaller and smaller. To protect ourselves and our families from the many contagious diseases we must encourage our representatives to support GAVI, the international vaccine alliance. Florida lost more than 404 per 100,000 people due to COVID in past years, while California lost 256. This was because of our state’s high vaccination rate. The more we protect the world, the more we protect ourselves. Bill Nicholson Martinez Like Trump, Vance is in race for himself Re: “The unnerving changeability of JD Vance” (Page A7, July 30). In her column, Michelle Goldberg suggests psychological factors that might explain JD Vance’s political transformation. I think the appeal of choosing to be Donald Trump’s running mate is much simpler. If Trump wins and JD Vance becomes vice president, by certifying only an election result he approves of, he alone will choose the president who follows Trump. If he runs for election, he may certify his own victory. Chris Brown Oakland Liars in both parties make Haley best pick On the right, we have Donald Trump’s big lie that he actually won the last election. And now the left has its own big lie: that Joe Biden was perfectly healthy and able to function in his capacity as president. Kamala Harris, now the Democrats’ candidate for president, helped propagate that lie. The fact that both major candidates for president are proven liars shows how the lust for power has corrupted our major political parties. The Democrats have gone so far as to dispense with any democratic process in the selection of Harris. Neither party is deserving of the presidency, and neither Trump nor Harris is qualified or fit to be president. Our democracy is in trouble — from the Democrats as much as the Republicans. The solution is a new, moderate party. Absent that, the only viable presidential candidate to emerge is Nikki Haley. In November, write in Nikki for president.

I’m not done talking.” I’m proud of him. I’m also proud of Kamala Harris, who embodies a heart and a soul, and who, I am confident, has the grit, experience and wisdom to create a forward trajectory for all inhabitants of our country. Kamala’s talking and I’m listening. Sharon Brown Walnut Creek Harris administration would offer hard lesson I can understand why many young, first-time voters, especially those right out of high school, will flock to Kamala Harris. It gives them the exciting opportunity to make history by electing our first woman president with the promise of a lot of free stuff and a comfortable life. It will take them a few election cycles to learn that all politicians lie and that there is no such thing as a free lunch. They will also learn that most presidents do more harm than good, and some are so bad their policies and decisions get people killed. Right now, our volunteer military enlistments are falling short of their goals and the world is a tinder box in part because of our country’s perceived weakness. How the bad guys act under a Harris presidency versus a Donald Trump one may result in a life-altering change of plans for those first-time voters of draft age.

Fred talks about his own experiences and shows a pretty disturbing side of his uncle. Growing up in Jamaica, Queens, Fred had a close relationship with Donald due to his own father's struggles with alcoholism. He recounted, \"I had a bike stolen by three Black kids,\" Fred explained. When the police recovered the bicycle, it was Donald who accompanied young Fred to retrieve it. \"Donald was — he absolutely wanted to see this kid put in jail,\" Fred recalled. Despite being just 10 years old at the time, Fred said he objected, not wanting to ruin another child's life over a bicycle theft, as per The Raw Story. The conversation took a darker turn as Fred described hearing his uncle use racial slurs. \"I was there. I have absolutely no doubt whatsoever. Twice, he used the N-word,\" he stated firmly. Fred talked about how this incident tied into what Donald did later, like when he loudly criticized the Central Park Five, who are now called the Exonerated Five. But the most surprising part was when Fred talked about his son, William Trump, who was born with a rare genetic disorder causing serious disabilities. Fred said that when he asked Donald for more money to help with William's medical care, his uncle's response was chilling. \"Without hesitation, [Trump] said, 'Your son doesn't recognize you. Let him die and move to Florida,'\" Fred told the visibly shocked hosts. He added, \"I don't think you could hear something like that and not be surprised. But that is what he has become. It's sad.\" The Donald team quickly shot down these accusations. Steven Cheung, who handles Trump's communications, put out a statement saying the claims were \"completely fabricated and total fake news of the highest order.\" Cheung said, \"Anyone who knows President Trump knows he would never use such language.\" Fred has been pretty open about not liking his uncle's politics. On a show, he said he's gonna vote for Vice President Kamala Harris in the next election. \"I believe in policy over politics, and without question, Kamala Harris's policies are what I get behind,\" he declared. Fred's book and interviews offer a unique peek into the private life of a very well-known political figure. Fred was on The View as part of a media tour for his book. Earlier that same day, he was on Good Morning America, where he called his uncle \"atomic crazy\" and said he had really made a mark on the family, as per The Hill.","summary":"&#34;I was there&#34; and heard him &#34;use the N-word,&#34; Fred Trump III stated firmly.

Trump was directly asked if he believes Vice President Kamala Harris is a “DEI hire,” and his response was to criticize Harris for previously leaning into her Indian heritage only to “turn black” and embrace her African American heritage. Some Republicans were disconcerted by his retort. “Race and gender have nothing to do with why Kamala Harris is the most unpopular Vice President in history,” Karoline Leavitt, the Trump campaign National press secretary, told the Washington Examiner. “Kamala failed at her job as Border Czar, supported all of Joe Biden’s disastrous policies, and lied to the American people about Biden’s cognitive decline,” Leavitt added. “She is weak, dishonest, and dangerously liberal, and that’s why the American people will reject her on November 5th.” Harris publicly supported Biden to remain as Democrats’ presidential nominee up until the point that he dropped his reelection bid and endorsed her. She has not signaled any knowledge or feeling that she believes his mental acuity has been impaired. Republicans, such as Trump and his campaign, however, have accused her of covering for her boss. From a longtime NABJ member’s point of view Tariq Nasheed, a longtime member of the NABJ, shared his thoughts on Trump’s messaging on DEI with the Washington Examiner. Nasheed said that “Trump needs to drop the DEI messaging” because people used the term as “another boogieman code word meant to vilify Black people.” He warned that “it would be hard for Trump to get away from the racism allegations while still using racial code words, that everyone understands to be racial.” Nasheed, who has been critical of Harris regarding her black identity before, said he doesn’t believe the vice president was “a DEI hire,” but he doesn’t consider Trump’s comments about her racial identity to be “an attack.” “This has been a major discussion within Black American society,” he said. “Many Black people question why Kamala Harris, who does NOT come from a Foundational Black American lineage, starts engaging in performative Blackness during every political season. We remember when she was absolutely being promoted and identified as an Indian American woman.” He added, “She has a practice of cosplaying Foundational Black American cultural aesthetics, and this legitimately causes many Black people to question her motives and authenticity.” Black commentators warn Trump not to ‘take the bait’ Three black conservative or conservative-leaning political commentators told the Washington Examiner how they would recommend Trump reshape his messaging on DEI going forward. The commentators, all of whom have been critical of Harris before, agreed that the former president should turn his focus away from race and slam Harris on policy. “DEI is a tired dog whistle for Democrats,” Armstrong Williams, radio host and part owner of the Baltimore Sun, said. “Trump & Co. don’t need to take the bait. Make this race NOTHING about color. No one cares.” Williams said inflation is “killing the black community” just as much if not more than it is the white community. He also listed fentanyl use, housing, immigration, and wage growth as issues that are hurting black people the most. “You name the policy, and Harris is weak on it.” “So don’t chase these DEI and other fake words,” he added. “Stay on mission: she’s a failed border czar who can’t govern on the issues that matter most.” Stacy Washington, an Air Force veteran and ambassador for black leadership network Project 21, agreed with criticism of Harris leaning into her black heritage “after years of her using her Indian heritage to identify with voters in California,” but warned that focusing on this distracts the public from Harris’s far-left record. Washington told the Washington Examiner that Harris leaning into her black heritage “smacks of rank opportunism” but “that is her personality, and she will continue to distract from her far left viewpoints as long as we dance to her tune.” “From here on out,” Washington said Trump should focus on the issues voters by and large agree on. “Americans want the southern border closed, lower interest rates, lower inflation, and less foreign entanglements (less war),” Washington said. “President Trump gave America all of these things and can do so again.” Deroy Murdock, Fox News contributor and emeritus media fellow with the Hoover Institution, said, “Kamala Harris and the far-Left Democrats want Donald J. Trump to focus on race” so that anything “he says will be turned into, ‘Racist!’” “Rather than play their game,” he offered, “Trump should focus on public policy.” He recommended Trump ask voters if they are better off now than they were under his first term, if they are “happier now paying higher prices for energy, food, and housing,” if they prefer the Biden-Harris administration’s “wide-open border” to Trump’s “much-tighter border,” and if they “feel safer on America’s streets and with this country’s place in the world” under the current administration. What is a ‘DEI hire’? When ABC’s Rachel Scott asked Trump if Harris was a “DEI hire,” before mentioning her race, he asked for a definition of “DEI.” Scott told him that it stands for “diversity, equity, and inclusion” but did not elaborate, possibly standing as the reason Trump did not directly answer the question. Featured in many colleges, businesses, and government agencies, DEI initiatives were designed to foster the participation and equitable treatment of all people regardless of their race, sex, and other categories. However, these initiatives have resulted in such categories being considered for college admittance, job roles, and other positions that are traditionally awarded through merit. When Scott asked Trump if Harris was a “DEI hire,” she was really asking him if the vice president was selected based on her race, sex, or some other unchangeable category. As Nasheed, the longtime NABJ member, noted, this language has adopted racial undertones, and some people have used the term “DEI hire” to describe any woman or minority chosen for a prominent role. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER However, accusations of Harris being a “DEI hire” were fed by then-presidential hopeful Joe Biden’s 2020 promise to select a woman as his running mate. He additionally vowed to put a black woman on the Supreme Court before eventually nominating Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson in 2022. As of 2024, 10 states have signed anti-DEI legislation into law and 16 other states have proposed similar legislation.","summary":"Former President Donald Trump’s messaging on diversity, equity, and inclusion was put under the microscope during a hostile interview at the National Association of Black Journalists convention on Wednesday.

Vance, speaking in front of the border wall in the town of Hereford, called Harris a failed “border czar” and said she should have worked with U.S. agencies to deal with illegal crossings, even though Harris was tasked with a narrower role of addressing migration from Northern Central America. “Kamala Harris as border czar was asked to coordinate all these functions in government and she’s done nothing,” he said. Republicans have tried to hold Harris responsible for high levels of illegal immigration under President Joe Biden, a Democrat who dropped his presidential bid last month. Biden’s exit paved the way for Harris to become the likely nominee. Harris has responded by emphasizing her support for a bipartisan U.S. Senate border security bill introduced earlier this year. Republicans rejected the bill after Trump came out in opposition. “Donald Trump does not care about border security,” Harris said during a speech in Atlanta on Tuesday. “He only cares about himself.” While the number of migrants caught illegally crossing the border soared to record levels under Biden, they have plummeted since Biden issued new border restrictions in June. U.S. Border Patrol caught around 57,000 migrants crossing illegally in July, two U.S. officials told Reuters, the lowest monthly total since September 2020 when Trump was still president. Vance, a Republican U.S. senator from Ohio who often speaks of his childhood exposure to drug addiction, said Harris’ policies had allowed fentanyl to enter the U.S. although most convicted fentanyl traffickers in recent years were U.S. citizens. Vance said American children “feel overwhelmed with migrant children who shouldn’t be there” and that hospital wait times “have exploded” because migrants are seeking healthcare. The Trump campaign did not immediately provide supporting evidence for either assertion. “The human toll of this is the thing that we cannot forget,” Vance said.","summary":"HEREFORD, Arizona >> Donald Trump&#8217;s running mate JD Vance blamed Vice President Kamala Harris for illegal immigration during a visit to the U.S.-Mexico border in Arizona on Thursday and claimed that migrants were overwhelming U.S. schools and hospitals.","url":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2024/08/01/breaking-news/vance-blames-harris-for-illegal-immigration-during-border-visit/","image":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/web1_2024-08-01T200757Z_1_LYNXMPEK7027N_RTROPTP_3_USA-ELECTION-VANCE-BORDER.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-01 23:22:00","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.486},{"id":253186178,"title":"Trump is making his 2024 campaign about Harris’ race, whether Republicans want him to or not","text":"NEW YORK (AP) — Donald Trump has found tremendous success from the very first moment he stepped onto the presidential stage by stoking racial animus. Democrats expressed new outrage this week at the former president’s derisive and false charge that Vice President Kamala Harris, who is of Jamaican and Indian heritage, only recently “turned Black” for political gain. Some Republicans — even from within Trump’s own campaign — seemed to distance themselves from the comment. But Trump’s rhetoric this week, and his record on race since he entered politics nearly a decade ago, indicate that divisive attacks on race may emerge as a core GOP argument in the three-month sprint to Election Day — whether his allies want them to or not. A Trump adviser, granted anonymity Thursday to discuss internal strategy, said the campaign doesn’t need to focus on “identity politics” because the case against Harris is that she is “so liberal it’s dangerous.” The adviser pointed to Harris’ record on the Southern border, crime, the economy and foreign policy. In a sign that Trump may not be coordinating his message with his own team, the Republican presidential nominee doubled down on the same day with a new attack on Harris’ racial identity. He posted on his social media site a picture of Harris donning traditional Indian attire in a family photo. Sen. Cynthia Lummis, a Wyoming Republican who has endorsed Trump, was among a number of lawmakers on Capitol Hill who said Thursday that the rhetoric around race and identity is not “helpful to anyone” this election cycle. “People’s skin color doesn’t matter one iota,” Lummis said in an interview. Trump turned to an old tactic against Harris It’s been less than two weeks after President Joe Biden ended his reelection bid and endorsed Harris. Trump has had to pivot from campaigning against an 81-year-old white president showing signs of decline to facing a 59-year-old biracial vice president who is drawing much larger crowds and new enthusiasm from Democratic donors. Trump went to the National Association of Black Journalists convention on Wednesday. In an appearance carried live on cable news and shared widely online, he falsely suggested Harris misled voters about her race. “I didn’t know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black and now she wants to be known as Black. So, I don’t know, is she Indian or is she Black?” Trump said Wednesday. At a Pennsylvania rally hours later, Trump’s team displayed years-old news headlines describing Harris as the “first Indian-American senator” on the big screen in the arena. And Ohio Sen. JD Vance, Trump’s running mate, told reporters traveling with him that Harris was a “chameleon” who changed her identity when convenient. Harris attended Howard University, the historically Black institution where she pledged the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority, and has often talked throughout her career about being both about being Black and Indian American. Some Republicans argued that Trump’s message on race is part of a broader pitch that may appeal to some Black voters. “We’re focused on policy and how we can actually make waves and changes in the Black community. Economics, education, inflation, lowering costs. That’s what the message is,” said Diante Johnson, president of the Black Conservative Federation, which supports Trump’s efforts to win over more Black voters and hosted him at a gala in February. Veteran Republican pollster Frank Luntz said he explored the issue during a Wednesday focus group with swing voters almost immediately after Trump’s interview. He found that Harris may be vulnerable to criticism based on her gender, but race-based attacks could hurt Trump among the voters that matter most this fall. Much has changed, Luntz said, since Trump rose to prominence by questioning the citizenship of Barack Obama, the nation’s first Black president. “Trump seems to think that he can criticize her for how she’s dealt with her race. Well, no one’s listening to that criticism. It simply doesn’t matter,” Luntz said. “If it’s racially driven, it will backfire.” Eugene Craig, the former vice chair of the Maryland Republican Party, said that Trump “got what he wanted” at the NABJ convention but that the substance of his argument risked being more offensive than appealing. “The one thing that Black folks will never tolerate is disrespecting Blackness, and that goes for Black Republicans too,” said Craig, who is Black and worked as a staffer for conservative pundit Dan Bongino’s 2012 Senate campaign. He is now supporting Harris. Trump has a long history of racist attacks Trump has frequently used race to go after his opponents since he stepped into presidential politics nearly a decade ago. Trump was perhaps the most famous member of the so-called “birther” movement questioning where Obama was born. He kicked off his first campaign by casting Mexican immigrants as “rapists” and drug traffickers and later questioned whether a U.S. federal judge of Mexican heritage could be fair to him. While in the White House, Trump defended a white supremacist march in Charlottesville, Virginia, and suggested that the U.S. stop accepting immigrants from “shithole” countries including Haiti and parts of Africa. In August 2020, he suggested Harris, who was born in California, might not meet the Constitution’s eligibility requirements to be vice president. And just two weeks after formally entering the 2024 campaign, he dined with notorious white supremacist Nick Fuentes at his Mar-a-Lago residence. Trump won in 2016 but lost reelection in 2020 to Biden by close margins in several swing states. He swept the 2024 Republican primary even while facing a raft of criminal charges. Some Trump critics worried that his racial strategy might resonate with a significant portion of the electorate anyway. Voters will decide in November whether to send a Black woman to the Oval Office for the first time in the nation’s nearly 250-year history. “I hope Trump’s attacks on Harris are just him flailing about ineffectively. But put together Trump’s shamelessness, his willingness to lie, his demagogic talent, and the issue of race — and a certain amount of liberal complacency that Trump is just foolish — and I’m concerned,” Bill Kristol, a leading conservative anti-Trump voice, posted on social media Thursday. The Harris campaign thinks there’s little upside for Trump A Harris adviser described the moment as an opportunity to remind voters of the chaos and division that Trump breeds. But the adviser, granted anonymity to discuss internal strategy, said it would be a mistake for Democrats to engage with Trump’s attacks on race at the expense of the campaign’s broader focus on key policies. So long as the campaign does not get distracted, the adviser said, Harris’ team believes there is little political upside for Trump to continue attacking Harris’ racial identity. Harris told a gathering of a historically Black sorority on Wednesday that Trump’s attack was “the same old show: the divisiveness and the disrespect.” On the ground in at least one swing state, however, there were signs that Trump’s approach may be resonating — at least among the former president’s white male base. Jim Abel, a 65-year-old retiree who attended a rally for Vance in Arizona on Wednesday, said he agreed with Trump’s focus on Harris’ racial identity. “She’s not Black,” Abel said. “I’ve seen her parents.

After a New York appeals court upheld his gag order Thursday, he won't be for a while. By MICHAEL R. SISAK Associated Press August 1, 2024 at 11:16PM Former President Donald Trump sings along with “God Bless the USA” as he takes to the stage at a rally at the Herb Brooks National Hockey Center on July 27, 2024 St. Cloud, Minn. (Glen Stubbe/Star Tribune) NEW YORK — Two months after his felony conviction, Donald Trump still isn’t allowed to say everything he wants about his historic hush money criminal case. After a New York appeals court upheld his gag order Thursday, he won’t be for a while. The state's mid-level appellate court denied the Republican former president and current nominee's latest bid to lift the restrictions, swatting away a last-minute argument that he's unfairly muzzled while Vice President Kamala Harris, his likely Democratic opponent, pits herself as an ex-prosecutor taking on a ''convicted felon.'' At the same time, Trump's lawyers are again asking trial Judge Juan M. Merchan to exit the case, saying his daughter's work for Harris' 2020 presidential campaign underscores questions about his ability to be impartial. Merchan rejected two prior recusal requests, last year and at the start of the trial in April, saying the defense's concerns were ''hypothetical'' and based on ''innuendos'' and ''unsupported speculation.'' In a letter to Merchan made public Thursday, Trump lawyer Todd Blanche said Harris' entry into the presidential race makes those issues ''even more concrete'' and said the judge hasn't addressed them \"at a level of detail sufficient to repair the lack of public confidence in the integrity of these proceedings.\" Separately, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, sent a letter to Loren Merchan demanding she turn over any documents pertaining to Harris' campaign, President Joe Biden's abandoned reelection campaign, and any discussions she or her firm may have had about Trump's hush money prosecution. Jordan's request Thursday includes any conversations she may have had with her father about the case. A message seeking comment was left with Loren Merchan. In its gag order ruling Thursday, a five-judge panel found that Judge Merchan was correct in keeping some restrictions in place until Trump is sentenced because the case is still pending and his conviction doesn't constitute a change in circumstances that warrants lifting it. ''The fair administration of justice necessarily includes sentencing,'' they wrote. The gag order bars Trump from speaking out about the prosecution team, court staffers or their families, including Merchan's daughter, a Democratic political consultant. In June, Merchan lifted a ban on Trump commenting about witnesses and jurors, and he has always been free to speak about the judge and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, an elected Democrat whose office prosecuted the case. Trump is scheduled to be sentenced on Sept. 18, but the case and gag order could end before that if Merchan grants a defense request to throw out his conviction in light of the Supreme Court's presidential immunity ruling. Merchan said he plans to rule on Sept. 6.

The appeals court ruled a day after Blanche tried filing papers asking it to immediately lift the gag order. With a decision imminent, the court rejected the filing, which called the restrictions an ''unconstitutional, election-interfering'' restraint on Trump's free speech while he seeks to retake the White House. In a copy of the prospective filing provided to The Associated Press, Blanche wrote that Harris' entering the race had given the matter new urgency and that it's ''unconscionable that Harris can speak freely about this case, but President Trump cannot.\" The defense also revived complaints that prosecutor Matthew Colangelo was biased because he was a Justice Department official under Biden. Trump is unable to air those grievances himself because of the gag order. Trump's lawyers have made several efforts to lift the gag order. Their latest fight landed in the state's intermediate appeals court — the Appellate Division, one rung up from Merchan's trial court level — after they struck out with the state's top court. The Court of Appeals last month declined to hear Trump's gag order challenge, finding it did not raise ''substantial'' constitutional issues that would warrant immediate intervention. Merchan imposed the gag order in March, restricting Trump from commenting about witnesses, jurors and others connected to the case, after prosecutors raised concerns about his habit of attacking people involved in his legal matters. The judge soon expanded it to prohibit comments about his own family after Trump lashed out on social media at the judge's daughter and made false claims about her. During the trial, the judge held Trump in contempt of court and fined him $10,000 for violations, and he threatened to jail him if he did it again. Trump, who has denied any wrongdoing, was originally scheduled to be sentenced July 11. Merchan postponed it until September while he considers the impact of the Supreme Court's ruling, which gave broad protections to presidents and insulated them from prosecution for official acts. The ruling also restricted prosecutors from citing any official acts as evidence in trying to prove a president's unofficial actions violated the law. Trump's lawyers argue his trial was ''tainted'' by evidence that shouldn't have been allowed, pressing their case in a new court filing Thursday. Prosecutors contend the high court's opinion ''has no bearing'' on the hush money case because it involves unofficial acts for which the former president is not immune. A Manhattan jury convicted Trump on May 30 of falsifying records to cover up a potential sex scandal, making him the first ex-president convicted of a crime. Trump's conviction, on 34 felony counts, arose from what prosecutors said was an attempt to cover up a hush money payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels just before the 2016 presidential election. She claims she had a sexual encounter with Trump a decade earlier, which he denies. Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen paid Daniels and was later reimbursed by Trump. Prosecutors said Cohen disguised the reimbursements with Trump's knowledge by submitting monthly invoices for retainer payments as his personal lawyer. Trump's company logged the payments to Cohen as legal expenses. Prosecutors said the Daniels payment was part of a broader scheme to buy the silence of people who might have gone public during the 2016 campaign with embarrassing stories alleging Trump had extramarital sex. Trump has pledged to appeal his conviction, but he would not be able to do so until he is sentenced.","summary":"Two months after his felony conviction, Donald Trump still isn't allowed to say everything he wants about his historic hush money criminal case.

Called Your Voice, Your Power, Your Vote, the non-partisan initiative is meant to educate artists, songwriters, industry professionals and communities across the country about voter registration. Its website offers resources to register to vote, check voter registration status and request a ballot. The site also provides free imagery that can be used on social media and other platforms to encourage others to vote. Originally launched ahead of the 2020 presidential election, the project is presented in partnership with APIAVote, Black Futures Lab, National Black Justice Collective, Rock the Vote, Vote.Org, Voto Latino, and When We All Vote. “2024 is another important election year in the U.S., and we know that people can make their voices heard through voting,” said Towalame Austin, executive vp for global philanthropy and social impact at Sony Music Group. “We helped bring more voters out to the polls in 2020 with our partner organizations and we’re hoping to contribute to an even higher turnout this year. SMG is proud to once again use our platform to support civic participation.” The music industry is getting involved with the presidential election in increasingly prominent ways, with Megan Thee Stallion performing and Quavo speaking at a Kamala Harris rally in Atlanta earlier this week and the presumptive Democratic nominee also garnering support from artists including Charli XCX and Beyoncè, whose “Freedom” soundtracks Harris’ debut campaign video. Meanwhile, Republican nominee Donald Trump has gotten support from artists including Kid Rock and Jason Aldean. Additionally, the Music Sustainability Alliance recently announced a new monthly webinar series called The Green Room. The free series launches Sept. 3 with a session called “Turning Fans Into Activists,” which will focus on how artists are encouraging fans to become politically active and how they can do so without alienating them.","summary":"First launched in 2020, the non-partisan initiative is meant to educate artists, songwriters, industry professionals and communities about voter registration and turnout.","url":"https://www.billboard.com/pro/sony-music-voter-registration-campaign-2024-election/","image":"https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/american-flag-july-4th-2019-billboard-1548.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-01 23:12:57","author":"Katie Bain","authors":["Katie Bain"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.397},{"id":253185666,"title":"This election is really between Trump and the cultural institutions that are myth-building Kamala","text":"Live from New York, it’s Kamala Harris’ presidential myth-building. Deadline reported Wednesday that Maya Rudolph will return to “Saturday Night Live” this fall to reprise her role as Harris. If history is any indication, Rudolph, who has already portrayed Harris on the show 10 times and even won an Emmy for it, will give us the veep as a fun, fierce wine aunt — “Funt” — ready to disembowel her stuffy opponents with a withering takedown. It is true that both Harris and Trump have much to offer in terms of parody potential. Trump with his bombastic speech, stiff mannerisms and flag hugging. Harris’ word salads and off-putting cackle. Just imagine what “SNL” could do with her interview with Lester Holt — the one where he pointed out that she, the “border czar,” had not yet been to the actual border. “And I haven’t been to Europe,” she responded with an uncomfortable laugh. But I predict only one candidate will be made to look like a buffoon, because “SNL” has abandoned its old both-sides approach to political skewering. Gone are the days when the left and the right got the equal walloping they deserved — a precedent that disappeared once Obama came into office and former show writer Jim Downey noted the president had no “flaw or hook that you can caricature.” Really? It’s disappointing, but it also falls in line with how Harris’ nascent campaign has been treated. Because it turns out that Trump isn’t just running against Harris — he is running against liberal media and cultural institutions that are building a cocoon around the vice-president, creating a Kamala character the nation can see in the Oval Office. The media is allowing the Democratic Party to rewrite Harris’ history, from her far-left policy stances to her role heading up the border. Over the weekend, Politico ran a story about her stance on fracking, which she explicitly said — on camera in 2019 — that she wants to ban. “Harris campaign pledges she won’t ban fracking after Trump accusation,” Politico reported. After coming under fire, they dropped the “Trump accusations” from the headline but kept it in the story text. We’ve been told repeatedly by the media that Harris was not in charge of the border, despite a deluge of stories and clips from 2021 to suggest otherwise. This week’s New York Magazine’s cover proclaims “Kamalot,” with a picture of a laughing Harris on top of a coconut, while Gen Z Tiktok crowns her “brat“ (as we all know by now, that’s a good thing) with memes galore. Esquire dug into her cookbook collection. The Los Angeles Times actually ran a story headlined, “Kamala Harris is a cook — and she knows her LA restaurants. Will it help her win?” If it does, god help us. We get what we deserve. We’re all burnt toast. In the absence of real reporting, those frothy features are ridiculous. Every publication from the New York Times to the New Yorker has covered her “vibe shift” but not much about her policy shift. Harris has backed scrapping ICE. She was a Green New Deal sponsor and ranked the “most liberal” member of the Senate by GovTrack in 2019 — though that’s been memory holed. GovTrack changed their mind recently, retracting the label and saying rankings using data from a single year “was not sufficient to create a reliable portrait of the activity of legislators.” Funny how it just became a problem. Don’t forget, Harris has insisted all along that Biden is spry and healthy. She has not endured the primary process, and the campaign she ran in 2019 revealed her to be an unserious candidate with many flaws and little substance. She has had two political rallies, including one where she essentially acted as an MC for a Megan Thee Stallion’s performance. The Dems are running the same campaign they did in 2020 for Biden: from the basement. And with only three months to keep up this charade, it’s entirely possible she’ll be smuggled into the White House. So much for saving democracy. Meanwhile, Trump is saying he wants to renegotiate the terms of their debates, which he agreed upon with Biden, not Harris. But at least he is open to entering hostile territory. On Wednesday, he attended a National Black Association of Journalists panel which — depending on which social media echo system you inhabit — was either a smashing success or a Hindenburg-level disaster. But let’s not pretend Harris is running. She’s maneuvering through this new campaign one of those anti-gravity treadmills, moving her legs but not feeling the impact of pavement — or reality. And Team Trump is allowing it. Instead of exposing this nonsense and focusing on his opponent’s true political identity, Trump is getting into the mud on her racial identity. The Trump camp needs to focus on substance and less on personal attacks. Or they can add themselves to the list of people they are running against.","summary":"Live from New York, it's Kamala Harris' presidential myth-building.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/01/opinion/liberal-media-cultural-institutions-giving-kamala-an-easy-pass/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/screenshot_2024-08-01_at_4.08.19___pm_720.png?w=720","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-01 23:12:09","author":"Kirsten Fleming","authors":["Kirsten Fleming"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.312},{"id":253186694,"title":"Dan Bongino shocked over new phone footage capturing Trump’s would-be assassin","text":"Former Secret Service agent and talk show host Dan Bongino questioned how security missed former President Donald Trump’s would-be assassin, as newly unearthed footage captured on a cellphone was able to spot the shooter on the roof.

He also called the assassination attempt of Trump a “failure on multiple levels” Rowe took over as acting director after Kimberly Cheatle resigned from the position following her testimony before the House Oversight Committee last month.

Ever since she launched her first presidential campaign back in January of 2019, Kamala Harris has not held one US press conference. She has not done anything resembling a tough interview. She’s really no different from Joe Biden: Take away her teleprompter and her script, and things go sideways in a hurry. Compare that to Donald Trump, who on Wednesday was invited to appear before the National Association of Black Journalists in Chicago. Trump, in an effort to expand his inroads with black voters by making himself accessible, accepted the invitation. Smart move — because he has shown he can connect with minority voters across the board, especially during this campaign cycle. Recall his visits to the South Bronx and Harlem this spring, his sneaker convention appearance before a largely minority and Gen Z audience and his rally in the blue state of New Jersey with an estimated 100,000 people in attendance. His NABJ appearance was classic Trump, sparring out of the gate with the hopelessly biased ABC News correspondent Rachel Scott. Scott accused Trump of racism based on his criticism of Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg — a profoundly ridiculous premise, given how critical Trump has been of prosecutor Jack Smith, who at last check was a white guy. But when Trump was actually asked relevant questions about inflation and illegal immigration by Fox News anchor Harris Faulkner, he hammered Kamala on both issues, underscoring that during his time as president, black voters were far better off. The facts and numbers back that up: Inflation was lower, employment was higher. And illegal immigration under Biden-Harris has greatly impacted citizens in urban areas, where they’re seeing their jobs and social services like sanitation and education and police taken away. The Trump outreach is paying dividends: A recent CNN poll shows the Republican getting an eye-popping 30% of the black vote compared to Harris, who gets 63%. Usually the split is around 90/10 for the Democrat — so needless to say, if Trump can get even half that level of support, this race is over. For her part, Harris also received an invitation from the NABJ, but declined to appear live and will only do so at some point by Zoom (sound familiar?). The reason is simple: Harris and actual journalists asking germane questions about her radical policy positions simply cannot co-exist. And as we’ve seen from the Queen of Word Salads, she does not possess the ability to speak extemporaneously with anything resembling coherent arguments. She would have to answer questions on ending the fossil-fuel industry, abolishing ICE, ending all private health insurance and providing free health care to illegal immigrants, for starters. Harris would also be asked to explain her support of late-term abortion, sanctuary cities, allowing violent criminals to vote from jail and everything from her desire to expand the Supreme Court to allowing biological men to compete against biological women in sports. Team Harris thinks she can win not on the issues (outside of abortion), but on thin-sliced identity groups working on her behalf, such as the testosterone-challenged White Dudes for Harris, and perhaps the occasional interview with RuPaul’s drag queens. All foam and no beer. That’s Kamala Harris. And at a time when Americans face a raft of serious problems, from inflation to crime to an open border to an increasingly unstable world, we can’t have another candidate who hides from questions and accountability while going up against a fearless candidate like Donald Trump.

For the most part, that’s meant heavily scripted rallies with high-level entertainers (in popularity, not quality) doing the heavy lifting. On Thursday, she was put in a different position, though. Appearing in Houston, Harris gave the eulogy for recently passed Democrat politician Sheila Jackson Lee, and things got really weird. At one point, Harris started touting her own political record. She then called herself “the president,” which led to the room bursting out in applause. Remember, this is a funeral. Kamala Harris accidentally calls herself ‘the president’ during late Dem Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee’s eulogy — causing crowd to go wild pic.twitter.com/vAmOOuPl09 — New York Post (@nypost) August 1, 2024 HARRIS: It was Sheila Jackson Lee whose bill made Juneteenth a federal holiday (applause), which as a United States senator I was proud to co-sponsor, and then as president, as vice president, it was my honor (long applause)…with the president, with the president, it was my honor, it was my honor with our president Joe Biden to stand beside Shelia Jackson Lee as our president signed her bill into law. To make things even more uncomfortable, as all the ravenous applause is happening, the camera shot changes to a wide shot of Jackson Lee’s coffin. Harris then begins laughing as she stumbles through the rest of her statement. In response, many cited the Paul Wellstone memorial back in 2002 which turned into an anti-Republican event, complete with cheers and jeers. Those were simpler times when the press tried to maintain some facade of fairness, and the Democrat choice to turn a funeral into a campaign rally turned into a bonafide scandal. The blowback was so severe that it may have tipped the scales toward Republicans in an election they were predicted to lose. While I sincerely doubt that the press will have anything to say about Harris’ use of a funeral to play politics or the very disrespectful actions of the audience, it’s still disturbing. Is nothing sacred anymore? Who brags about their own political record at someone else’s funeral? And who cheers for that person as they are doing so? It’s just such a foreign concept to me (and likely most of you). The Democrat thirst for power knows no limits, though. They will use any opportunity to boost their prospects, no matter how inappropriate. In other words, they play for keeps, and in an environment where there are no consequences for anything they do, can you blame them?","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nKamala Harris&#8217; handlers have been carefully curating all of her public appearances&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Kamala Harris makes a campaign appearance at a funeral and refers to herself as &#8216;the President&#8217; in a strange and unusual moment first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/kamala-harris-makes-a-campaign-appearance-at-a-funeral-and-refers-to-herself-as-the-president-in-a-strange-and-unusual-moment/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rewrite-this-title-Kamala-Harris-Campaigns-at-a-Funeral-Calls.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-01 23:05:57","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.23},{"id":253184974,"title":"Trump campaign reveals substantial July fundraising haul that’s likely to fall short of Kamala Harris’ windfall ","text":"Former President Donald Trump raised nearly $139 million last month, a massive fundraising haul in itself — but likely not enough to surpass Vice President Kamala Harris’ eye-popping July total. The 78-year-old Republican nominee and his authorized committees raked in $138.7 million in July and had $327 million in cash on hand, his campaign announced Thursday. “These numbers reflect continued momentum with donors at every level and provide the resources for the final 96 days until victory November 5th,” the Trump campaign said in a statement. Trump’s July haul came during a chaotic month that saw the former president survive an assassination attempt, formally receive the GOP nomination at the Republican National Convention and have to face a new opponent after President Biden dropped out of the race. His July sum eclipsed his $111.8 million June total but fell short of the $141 million in contributions he received in May, the same month he was found guilty in the Manhattan hush-money case. The Harris campaign has not announced its July totals, but they are expected to easily surpass Trump’s. Harris, 59, quickly locked up support from top Democrats after the 81-year-old president ended his re-election bid and endorsed her in a historically unprecedented move. Last week, her campaign claimed that the vice president enjoyed a mind-boggling $200 million fundraising bonanza in the days after Biden’s July 21 withdrawal. The quickly rebranded Harris for President campaign said that 66% of those donations came from first-time contributors during the 2024 cycle. Harris’ haul does not include funds the vice president inherited from Biden’s campaign and committee accounts, which the Trump campaign has asked the Federal Election Commission to look into, arguing that the transfer is the “largest campaign finance violation in American history.”","summary":"The 78-year-old Republican nominee and his authorized committees raked in $138.7 million in July and had $327 million in cash on hand, the Trump campaign announced Thursday. ","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/01/us-news/trump-campaign-reveals-substantial-july-fundraising-haul-thats-likely-to-fall-short-of-kamala-harris-windfall/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/trump-campaign-reveals-substantial-july-86699861.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/Z3HXEpOH-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-01 23:00:52","author":"Victor Nava","authors":["Victor Nava"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.42},{"id":253185520,"title":"Katie Couric says Democrats have 'kind of lost' working class votes, urges party to 'do better'","text":"Former NBC \"Today\" show host Katie Couric warned this week that Democrats have \"kind of lost\" working class voters and urged the party to \"do better\" to regain their trust before the November election. \"I think that there needs to be a greater connection between the working class and the Democratic Party because, let’s face it…the Democrats have kind of lost the working class,\" Couric told former Obama White House deputy chief of staff Alyssa Mastromonaco on the \"Hysteria\" podcast. \"It was never that way during all my years of covering politics,\" Couric added. \"You had the head of the Teamsters at the RNC, you have people buying into this notion that Republicans care about dinner table issues much more than Democrats.

Desalination is an unjust greenwashing scheme that can privatize water, is costly and energy-intensive, and could harm communities and ecosystems already affected by climate change. As someone born and raised in the Bay Area, I was shocked to see a false water solution that is so awful for people and the environment popping up in my own community. That’s why organizations like Food & Water Watch advocate for true, sustainable climate-resilient solutions like water conservation. An emphasis on so-called technological solutions like desalination blames water shortages on a lack of natural resources instead of short-sighted water policy.

Francesca Rossi Saratoga Let Trump’s behavior set terms of sentence The problem with sentencing Donald Trump is that half the country will be seriously upset if his Sept. 18 sentencing is strict and the other half will be equally upset if it isn’t. The solution is to make Mr. Trump directly responsible for his own sentence. If he upholds the convictions, Judge Merchan should inform Trump that sentencing takes into consideration many factors, but foremost is whether the defendant takes responsibility for his behavior and shows remorse. He should then allow Mr. Trump a few days to file a statement of what he requests the judge to consider. If nothing is filed, Donald Trump’s behavior, including 10 gag order violations, sets the tone for justifying a stern sentence, including incarceration. Same if a filing made lacks responsibility. But if he takes responsibility and expresses remorse, Judge Merchan could cite that as the basis for leniency. Todd Lowenstein San Jose GOP fears competitive women and minorities Republicans despise Diversity Equity and Inclusion policies. They claim that Democratic Vice President and presumptive nominee Kamala Harris is where she is in her career because of DEI. The advantage they had in business and government, based on their gender and race is now in contention, as women graduate from college in greater numbers than men. Positions once exclusively held by White men are now competitive for women and minorities because of education and experience, which is exactly what Kamala Harris embodies.

For years, rivals and critics have lodged accusations that Harris shifts her personal identity to her political advantage and that she is, in fact, not who she claims to be. Those attacks, based on falsehoods, misinformation and conspiratorial notions, have increased dramatically in the week and a half since she emerged as Democrats’ all-but-certain standard-bearer. Just hours after President Joe Biden announced that he would not seek a second term, right-wing agitator Laura Loomer posted on social media site X that Harris “pretends to be black” as part of what she called a “delusional, Democrat DEI quota.” The next day, Tucker Carlson, the former Fox News host who spoke at the Republican National Convention last month, said on his popular interview show that the vice president was “sort of Black, sort of Indian.” Rapper Lil Pump, a Trump supporter who has some 20 million followers across Instagram, TikTok and X, said Sunday that “Kamala Harris isn’t even black…she’s Indian.” Their comments, seemingly aimed at suggesting to Black voters that the Democratic candidate does not represent them and, more broadly, planting the idea that Harris is inauthentic, helped turn what had been a trickle of such content into a gusher. Overnight, conservative corners of the internet, long fixated on Biden’s age, swung to what looked to be their newest target. Years-old video clips of Harris acknowledging her South Asian heritage found fresh currency, along with memes mocking her speaking style and even a Billy Joel song modified to say that “she’s not Black or white, Indian, Jamaican.” In fact, the vice president is the daughter of a Black Jamaican father and an Indian mother, both of whom immigrated to the United States before Harris was born in Oakland, California. She has long identified as both Black and Indian. “This is something she’s dealt with her entire career,” said Neil Makhija, president of the advocacy group Indian American Impact. He pointed out that Harris attended Howard University, a historically Black university, and belongs to a prominent Black sorority, Alpha Kappa Alpha. “Trump questioning her identity and heritage is nothing new, and it’s part of a long-running strategy of employing racial division and animus.” On Wednesday, Trump embraced the discourse wholeheartedly while sitting for a Q&A session at the National Association of Black Journalists convention in Chicago. “I didn’t know she was Black,” Trump said, “until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black.” He later followed that statement, which drew gasps from the room, with a post on his social network, Truth Social, that Harris was “stating she’s Indian, not Black” and that she was a “stone cold phony.” Defenders of Harris compared the remarks to birtherism — the debunked idea that Barack Obama should not have served as president because he was not a natural-born citizen. Trump is widely credited as an originator of the birther conspiracy. Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., who is on the short list to be Harris’ running mate, called the former president’s comments Wednesday “overtly racist.” The campaign against Harris similarly began with questions about whether she was legally able to serve. As far back as January 2019, Chris Cuomo, then a CNN anchor, responded to a claim by Jacob Wohl, a right-wing activist and Trump supporter, that she was “not eligible to be president” by suggesting that Harris, then a senator, could settle the matter by producing “proof.” Harris responded weeks later, saying, “This is the same thing they did to Barack” in an interview on “The Breakfast Club” podcast, which has three Black hosts. “This is not new to us. And so, I think we know what they are trying to do.” By August 2020, when she was selected to be Biden’s running mate, copies of Harris’ California birth certificate began circulating on social media, often amplified by conservative voices looking to discredit her. They wrongly pointed to a line on the document noting that her father’s “color or race” was “Jamaican” as evidence that she was not in fact Black. While more than 92% of Jamaicans have Black ancestry, some people have falsely asserted that because her father, Donald J. Harris, was descended from a man who had owned slaves in the early 19th century, he could not be Black. But it was quite common for slaveholders to father children with women held as slaves. Donald Harris is credited as the first Black scholar to receive tenure in Stanford University’s economics department. Lavern Spicer, a prominent Trump supporter who is running for Congress in Florida, referred to Kamala Harris as Black in late 2020 but soon began claiming that the opposite was true, stating on social media in January 2021 that Harris “can play the Black card because the media covers for her, but that girl is not Black.” Since then, Spicer has hammered on that point in scores of posts, including one last week asserting that Harris was not Black but an “Indian woman married to a Jewish man.” Other critics have also challenged her Indian identity, claiming that she hides it for political benefit. “Show me a picture of Kamala in a sari,” said Vish Burra, executive secretary of the New York Young Republican Club, while discussing Asian American identity on a panel hosted by Vice in late 2022. Burra, who is of South Asian descent, quipped, “I’ve seen Justin Trudeau wear Indian clothes before her.” (Trump, continuing his false line of attack on Harris on Thursday, posted a photo that has been widely circulated among right-wing influencers in recent weeks of Harris wearing a sari.) So far, Harris and her campaign have largely tried to avoid debates about her background, focusing instead on the divisive nature of such rhetoric. Speaking at an event for a Black sorority in Houston on Wednesday evening, Harris avoided any rebuttals to Trump’s statements, saying simply that “the American people deserve better.” But later in the evening, her campaign’s rapid response team took on the matter more directly, posting on X that “Kamala is both Black and Indian” and that “you can be two things at once.” Regardless, some of Trump’s most avid supporters have dug in. On Wednesday afternoon, Loomer resurfaced Harris’ birth certificate, writing on X that it “proves she is NOT BLACK.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times. © 2024 The New York Times Company","summary":"When former President Donald Trump questioned Vice President Kamala Harris&#8217; racial identity Wednesday, he lifted a long-standing and false line of attack from the fringes of political discourse to the very center of a presidential campaign.","url":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2024/08/01/breaking-news/trump-elevates-false-fringe-attacks-on-harris/","image":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/web1_20240801_brk_tru02.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-01 23:00:00","author":"New York Times","authors":["New York Times"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.04},{"id":253185944,"title":"Scrapped fundraisers and watching from the treadmill.

Another watched TV commentators speculate about his viability as the pick while getting in a workout. A third is sticking to praising the new presidential candidate who is closing in on a decision. As Vice President Kamala Harris prepares to decide on a running mate, three Democrats thought to be on her short list — Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly — did nothing Thursday to suggest they aren’t still in contention. Shapiro scrapped three weekend fundraisers in the seaside communities on the coast of Long Island, New York, and his press secretary, Manuel Bonder, offered little explanation as to why. “The governor’s trip was planned several weeks ago and included several fundraisers for his own campaign committee,” Bonder said in a statement. “His schedule has changed and he is no longer traveling to the Hamptons this weekend.” One Shapiro fundraiser was to be hosted by Michael Kempner, a member of President Joe Biden ‘s national finance committee. Kempner said in a note to invitees that the gathering had been postponed and openly advocated for Shapiro to be Harris’ No. 2, writing that “many are speculating that this is a sign he will be the vice president.” “While this has not been confirmed, I continue to believe he is the best person for the job. And hope the speculation is true,” Kempner wrote. “As I learn more and get a new date for an event, I will keep you updated. There will also be many other events coming up to support Kamala, I will be sending out that information soon. I hope you will participate.” Harris has intensified her travel and fundraising schedule since Biden announced that he was abandoning his reelection bid and endorsing her on July 21. It’s given new hope to some Democrats who worried about the 81-year-old Biden’s prospects against Republican former President Donald Trump in November. The vice president and her team were still poring through reams of vetting material submitted by her choices for possible running mate, and staff have interviewed a number of potential picks. Harris is expected to conduct final interviews herself before making a selection. The Democratic National Committee is using virtual voting among delegates to compete the process of formally nominating Harris — and her yet-to-be-named running mate — by Monday, two weeks before the party’s convention opens in Chicago. The vice president and her No. 2 then plan to head out on a seven-state swing of key battlegrounds, including Pennsylvania, Arizona and North Carolina. Harris aides were looking to make the public announcement of her choice in the hours between when she officially becomes the Democratic nominee on Monday evening and a Tuesday rally in Philadelphia, where she is set to introduce her running mate to the country. Walz said Thursday that he’d watched commentary on his chances while running on his treadmill. “I don’t know if every high school geography teacher expects to be in this position,” joked Walz, who taught and coached football. He also acknowledged that he’s still in contention to join the Democratic ticket at an event in Bloomington, Minnesota, highlighting a state law increasing criminal penalties for gun crimes. Asked what set him apart from the other vice presidential contenders, Walz said he was excited about all of Harris’ possible choices, but pointed to his work implementing federal policy as a governor. “I’m not interviewing for anything. I just am who I am and put it out there,” Walz said. “I’m just going to say this, Yes, I’m a bit biased. I’m the chair of the Democratic Governors Association and Democratic governors have implemented the Biden-Harris administration in a way that has improved lives.” Kelly, meanwhile, refused to discuss his upcoming schedule or say whether he’d been vetted by Harris’ team. “It’s so obvious, she’s the person to bring us into the future,” Kelly said of Harris. “Donald Trump is about divisiveness and about taking away rights from women. Now he’s talking about voting rights, he did this week.

After a New York appeals court upheld his gag order on Thursday, he won’t be for a while. The state’s mid-level appellate court denied the Republican former president and current nominee’s latest bid to lift the restrictions, swatting away a last-minute argument that he’s being unfairly muzzled while Vice President Kamala Harris, his likely Democratic opponent, pits herself as an ex-prosecutor taking on a “convicted felon.” At the same time, Trump’s lawyers are again asking the trial judge, Juan M. Merchan, to step aside from the case, saying his daughter’s past work as a Democratic political consultant for Harris’ 2020 presidential campaign underscores questions about his ability to be impartial. Merchan rejected the defense’s two prior recusal requests, last year and at the start of the trial in April, saying its concerns were “hypothetical” and based on “innuendos” and “unsupported speculation.” In a letter Thursday to Merchan, Trump lawyer Todd Blanche said Harris’ entry into the presidential race makes those issues “even more concrete” and said the judge has failed to address them “at a level of detail sufficient to repair the lack of public confidence in the integrity of these proceedings.” In its gag order ruling Thursday, a five-judge panel found that Merchan was correct in keeping some restrictions in place until Trump is sentenced because the case is still pending and his conviction doesn’t constitute a change in circumstances that would warrant lifting it. “The fair administration of justice necessarily includes sentencing,” they wrote. The gag order bars Trump from speaking out about members of the prosecution team, court staffers or their families, including Merchan’s daughter, who has been the target of Trump’s wrath in the past. In June, Merchan lifted a ban on Trump publicly commenting about witnesses and jurors in the case, and he has always been free to speak directly about the judge and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, an elected Democrat whose office prosecuted the case. Trump is scheduled to be sentenced on Sept. 18, but the case and the gag order could be terminated before that if Merchan grants a defense request to throw out his conviction in light of the Supreme Court’s presidential immunity ruling. He said he plans to rule on Sept. 6. Trump lawyer Todd Blanche and a spokesperson for the Manhattan district attorney’s office declined to comment on Thursday’s ruling. The ruling came a day after Blanche tried to file papers asking the appeals court to immediately lift the gag order. With its decision imminent, the court rejected the filing, which had called the restrictions an “unconstitutional, election-interfering” muzzle on Trump’s free speech while he seeks to return to the White House. In a copy of the prospective filing provided to The Associated Press, Blanche wrote that Harris’ recent entry into the presidential race had given the matter new urgency and that “it is unconscionable that Harris can speak freely about this case, but President Trump cannot.” The defense also revived complaints that Merchan has a “glaring conflict of interest” because of his daughter’s ties to Harris and that one of the prosecutors, Matthew Colangelo, was biased because he was a Justice Department official under President Biden, a Democrat. Trump is unable to air those grievances himself because of the gag order. Trump’s lawyers have made several efforts to have the gag order lifted. Their latest fight landed in the state’s intermediate appeals court – the Appellate Division, one rung up from Merchan’s trial court level – after they struck out with the state’s top court. The Court of Appeals last month declined to hear Donald Trump’s gag order challenge, finding it did not raise “substantial” constitutional issues that would warrant immediate intervention. Merchan imposed the gag order in March, restricting Trump from commenting about witnesses, jurors and others connected to the case, after prosecutors raised concerns about his habit of attacking people involved in his legal matters. The judge soon expanded it to prohibit comments about his own family after Trump lashed out on social media at the judge’s daughter and made false claims about her. During the trial, the judge held Trump in contempt of court and fined him $10,000 for violations, and he threatened to jail him if he did it again. Trump, who has denied any wrongdoing, was originally scheduled to be sentenced July 11. Merchan postponed it until September while he considered the impact of the Supreme Court’s ruling, which gave broad protections to presidents and insulated them from prosecution for official acts. The ruling also restricted prosecutors from citing any official acts as evidence in trying to prove a president’s unofficial actions violated the law. Trump’s lawyers argue his trial was “tainted” by evidence that shouldn’t have been allowed, pressing their case in a new court filing Thursday. Prosecutors contend the high court’s opinion “has no bearing” on the hush money case because it involves unofficial acts for which the former president is not immune. A Manhattan jury convicted Trump on May 30 of falsifying records to cover up a potential sex scandal, making him the first ex-president convicted of a crime. Trump’s conviction, on 34 felony counts, arose from what prosecutors said was an attempt to cover up a hush money payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels just before the 2016 presidential election. She claims she had a sexual encounter with Trump a decade earlier, which he denies. Trump’s former lawyer Michael Cohen paid Daniels and was later reimbursed by Trump. Prosecutors said Cohen disguised the reimbursements with Trump’s knowledge by submitting monthly invoices for retainer payments as his personal lawyer. Trump’s company logged the payments to Cohen as legal expenses.

Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas) on Aug. 1, delivering a eulogy honoring the congresswoman’s decades of service to the United States at a church in Houston. Jackson Lee, 74, died on July 19, just more than a month after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. She was one of the most prominent black congressional leaders since she began representing Texas’s 18th district in 1995. She led the charge to make Juneteenth a federal holiday, worked to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, supported the Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell Repeal Act, and founded the Congressional Children’s Caucus. “No matter the issue—from delivering racial justice to building an economy for working people—she was unrelenting in her leadership,” President Joe Biden said in a statement after Jackson Lee’s death. In her eulogy, Harris called Jackson Lee a “fierce champion for justice” and a dear friend, recounting the congresswoman’s work firsthand while serving as a senator from California. “There was no task too big or too small for the congresswoman,” Harris said. “To know her was to marvel at her mastery of the legislative process … Sheila Jackson was one of the smartest and most strategic legislators in Washington, DC.” Harris thanked the congresswoman’s family for allowing “her to give so much to our country” after many years of support. The vice president was joined by former President Bill Clinton, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. Harris spoke of Jackson Lee’s battle to keep public pools open during a historic Houston heat wave after the city proposed closing them to save money during a budget shortfall. She worked with local business leaders to raise the funds to keep the pools open. “She never lost an opportunity to fight for the people she served, and her fight was born out of love. She had a big, big heart. Very few people have loved the people of Houston more than Sheila Jackson Lee,” the vice president said. Harris recounted calling the congresswoman a few days before her death to thank her and express gratitude for the “impact on me and my life.” “She was a force, but she never allowed anything to be mediocre. She always expected, in all of us, that we would rise to a point of excellence, knowing life was too short and there’s too much to be done,” Harris said. “I expressed to her my personal gratitude for her long-standing friendship and inspiration … her courage and her conviction and her relentless focus on those who are too often left out and left behind, and her unwavering belief in the power that we each have to change our country for the better.” The vice president called Jackson Lee a “change-maker” for her community and the country at large. “She worked with all her heart to lift up the people of her city, of her state, and of our nation. “And to honor her memory, let us continue to fight to realize the promise of America—a promise of freedom, opportunity, and justice—not just for some, but for all.” In the meantime, Harris has another important date on her calendar. She said she would name her running mate ahead of a campaign stop in Philadelphia on Aug. 6. The names believed to be on her vice presidential shortlist include Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, and Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg. The United Auto Workers endorsed her on July 31, joining the AFL-CIO, the American Federation of Teachers, and other unions that have endorsed Harris since she launched her campaign on July 21.","summary":"'She never lost an opportunity to fight for the people she served, and her fight was born out of love,' Harris said.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/harris-honors-sheila-jackson-lee-as-fierce-champion-of-justice-in-eulogy-5698135","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/08/01/id5698266-GettyImages-2164219797-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-01 22:50:46","author":"Jacob Burg","authors":["Jacob Burg"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.036},{"id":253185062,"title":"Walz sidesteps questions about being a candidate for Kamala Harris’ running mate","text":"Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is still playing coy about his prospects of joining the Democratic ticket as Kamala Harris’ vice presidential pick. In public remarks on Thursday, after an unrelated press conference in Bloomington, Walz didn’t acknowledge being in the final mix. But he said it’s been surreal being part of a shortlist of candidates considered. Walz avoided questions about whether Harris’ campaign is vetting him for the post or requesting an interview. “I don’t know if every high school geography teacher expects to be in this position at some point. But it is very strange to be running on my treadmill and have people talking about the things that are there and, and scream back, ‘This guy is too old,’ ” he said. “I’m running my butt off here on the treadmill.” Walz, a two-term governor and former six-term congressman, is said to be among a group of Democratic governors, including Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, in the running. Harris’ campaign is also considering U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona days ahead of an expected announcement. Walz encouraged Harris to pick a Democratic governor. As chair of the Democratic Governors Association, he said a governor could be a strong running mate. He didn’t say whether he viewed himself as a strong candidate. “I’m not interviewing for anything, I just am who I am and put it out there,” Walz said, adding, “I think there’s just that’s a decision that needs to be made by the vice president, and she will make it on what she sees.” Harris, who could be declared the official Democratic nominee by Monday, is expected to announce her pick in the coming days. That person will make the rounds with her next week on a five-day tour through several swing states, including an event in neighboring Wisconsin on Wednesday. Walz made the rounds appearing on national television outlets for interviews this week and distinguished himself by branding former President Donald Trump’s policy platforms as “weird.” It’s a line that landed and that other Democrats have repeated, while Republicans have attempted to deflect the moniker.","summary":"Walz, a two-term governor and former six-term congressman, is said to be among a group of Democratic governors in the running.","url":"https://www.twincities.com/2024/08/01/walz-sidesteps-questions-about-being-a-candidate-for-kamala-harris-running-mate/","image":"https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/AP24040636278458.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-01 22:44:54","author":"Dana Ferguson","authors":["Dana Ferguson"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.224}]}
