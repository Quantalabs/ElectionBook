{"offset":0,"number":50,"available":280,"news":[{"id":392289278,"title":"The YIMBY Hero Everyone Is Shouting At","text":"Scott Wiener has an unusual distinction in American politics: He upsets almost everybody. In the months before I met the California state senator—who is now running for Nancy Pelosi’s congressional seat—he had been harangued at one public meeting after another. In October, pro-Palestinian protesters disrupted his campaign’s pumpkin-carving event to shout: “Wiener, Wiener, you can’t hide; we charge you with genocide.” (This was not an isolated incident.) His usual response in these situations is to wait calmly and then carry on as normal.\n\nAt another event a few days later, the singer Tish Hyman, who identified herself as “the only Black lesbian here,” confronted Wiener about his far-reaching support for transgender inclusion. “What would you say to women who are seeking assurance that their safety will be protected from men who by California law can self-ID as women in women-only spaces?” asked Hyman. Wiener replied that he was committed to the safety of all women—trans women included. Video of the confrontation went viral.\n\nIn an era when many politicians try to make only the most cautious public statements, or the ones most palatable to their side of the political spectrum, Wiener is an outlier. As a gay, Jewish politician, he defends Israel in ways that get him in trouble with the left. His LGBTQ advocacy not only has made him a target of the right but also goes too far for people such as Hyman, who voted for Kamala Harris. And as a YIMBY—an acronym that stands for “Yes in My Backyard”—he’s faced down San Francisco’s powerful homeowner class, who wrap their aversion to new housing in the language of environmentalism and social justice. His successful housing legislation has attracted national attention—to get homes built in San Francisco, you have to be something close to a magician. He “works on thorny issues of policy and politics with a wonk’s focus and a jock’s tenacity,” a recent Mother Jones article declared. The New York Times’ Ezra Klein credited him for being, “for a very long time, this lonely voice trying to radically expand housing supply.”\n\nWiener stands athwart some of the touchiest fault lines in today’s politics, and his extreme tolerance for pushback has made him one of the most effective legislators in the country. He also might be the most shouted-at politician in America. “I have supporters in San Francisco who don’t love my housing work,” Wiener told me, “but they either don’t love it, but they understand why I’m doing it—or they don’t love it, but they tolerate it and they like me because of other issues, right?”\n\nAlthough in other ways you couldn’t imagine two more dissimilar men, Wiener’s ferociously active spirit resembles the Bolshevik antsiness of Donald Trump. The current president is attractive to some voters who might not agree with his values, or his language, or even his policies, but who like that the president is, well, presidenting. Last year, Trump bulldozed the East Wing of the White House, one of the most recognizable historic sites in the United States. In Democratic cities, people demand 38 meetings and three dozen environmental assessments before tearing down a crack den to build a nursery for sad orphans. Voters, Wiener argues, want politicians who are “willing to break glass to get those things done.”\n\nIn any shot of the California legislature, Wiener is instantly recognizable—a 6-foot-7 figure in a crisp suit and tie. He studied law at Harvard, where Ketanji Brown Jackson, now a Supreme Court justice, was a classmate. He moved to San Francisco in the 1990s to take a job with a law firm, where he worked on LGBTQ issues and housing policy. “As a young attorney in the late 1990s, I represented a long-term HIV survivor facing eviction,” he wrote last year. “He told me he could either return to the South for housing and lose access to quality HIV care, or stay in San Francisco for the care he needed but become homeless.”\n\nWiener has competition for Pelosi’s seat, and the composition of his rivals tells an interesting story about the various currents of the modern Democratic Party. One of his opponents is Saikat Chakrabarti, a 39-year-old start-up centimillionaire who previously served as chief of staff to Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Pelosi has not formally endorsed a candidate, but she has appeared at events with another contender, Connie Chan, a progressive member of the city’s Board of Supervisors who is popular with labor unions. Wiener says Chan caters to NIMBYs; her supporters call Wiener a pro-developer capitalist.\n\nThe race has now become a proxy for the California housing wars, which pit younger renters against established homeowners in neighborhoods zoned for single-family units. This summer, Wiener finally got so-called infill legislation passed, which permits denser construction near public transportation. Senate Bill 79 was the third version of the bill—the first, S.B. 827, died in committee all the way back in 2018. “When we did S.B. 827, it was like a brand-new thing, like no bill like that, even in the same universe had ever been introduced before,” Wiener told me.\n\nAfter its failure, Wiener looked for compromises and championed other bills aimed at increasing housing supply. At the same time, pressure groups worked hard to get younger, more YIMBY legislators elected. “Term limits have their downsides,” he told me. “One of the upsides is you have new, fresh thinking on different issues, and this is one of them.” Less high-mindedly, when S.B. 79 ran into resistance in Sacramento, he made a deal—pledging that housing more than 85 feet tall, or on land owned by transit authorities, would use unionized labor. After making such concessions, the bill finally squeaked through.\n\nIn the wild seas of California politics, his YIMBYism has drawn attacks from the left. “There are some people in San Francisco, if you believe in making it easier to build things, then that somehow makes you a moderate,” he said. Wiener is often attacked for not being left-wing enough. As a member of the city’s Board of Supervisors, he fought to ban public nudity from the Castro neighborhood outside of Pride parades and other special events. As a result, he was sharply criticized by radical nudists. “The San Francisco labels are stupid,” he told me. He considers himself “very progressive” and is more overtly sex-positive than even the typical Bay Area politician. He has posed shirtless in a leather necktie at the Folsom Street Fair, and spoken publicly about taking Truvada, a pill that dramatically reduces the chances of contracting HIV.\n\nSince October 7, Weiner has clearly found it hard to reconcile his commitment to Israel with the mood among leftists who endorse his support for LGBTQ rights. He is the son of Conservative Jewish parents who founded a congregation near their home in rural Turnersville, New Jersey; he says he was called a “kike” and a “Christ-hater” at school. Both of his nephews were Bar Mitzvah–ed in Israel, and he still has relatives there. “It’s the home of half of all Jews on the planet,” he notes.\n\nWiener has described Israel’s actions in Gaza as “indefensible,” condemned the violence of West Bank settlers, and called for an end to arms sales to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government. But he has also argued that Israel has a right to defend itself, and a right to exist as a Jewish state, and he does not characterize the bombing of Gaza as a genocide—a description that the San Francisco left insists upon. Both Chakrabarti and Chan had an easier time with the crowd at the candidates’ first joint appearance, on January 7, because they held up signs saying yes when the moderator asked whether Israel was committing genocide. Wiener declined to answer the question in either direction.\n\nHe links these purity tests to medieval tropes that defined “good Jews” as those who quietly obeyed the authorities and “bad Jews” as those who were too open about their identity. Today, he sees Jews being pushed out of progressive circles based on similar judgments. “If part of your Jewishness is, you know, that you support the homeland of the Jews and the home of one-half of all Jews on the planet, then that makes you a bad Jew,” he said. “If you’re not willing to use the exact language that we want you to use, then you’re a bad Jew.”\n\nWiener told me that since October 7, he has personally—“as a state senator who has no role in foreign policy”—experienced an increase in anti-Semitism. So have other Jewish leaders and businesspeople in San Francisco. “It’s not just about Israel,” he said. “It’s straight-up anti-Semitism.” On December 7, for example, he posted on X about California students who formed a human swastika on school football field, uploading their photo alongside a Hitler quotation about how “international financial Jews” would plunge the world into war, leading to the “annihilation of the Jewish race.”\n\nHe is regularly confronted in public by provocateurs with cameras, filming clips for social media. Wiener says he wants to stay open to those who want a genuine conversation, such as a non-Zionist Jewish friend who brought over eight people for a two-hour meeting on the subject. “We had a wonderful dialogue,” he maintains.\n\nTalking with Wiener was my way of stepping outside my own tribe on one set of issues. His transgender-rights advocacy, in my view, ignores serious gaps in the evidence base for youth gender medicine and brushes aside women’s concerns about biological males in their sports and single-sex spaces.\n\nThe story of the woman who confronted Wiener, Tish Hyman, is that she felt unsafe changing in front of a transgender woman, Alexis Black, in a gym. Hyman confronted the gym staff, who threw her and Black out; under California law, people can use whichever locker room aligns with their gender identity. After the incident went viral, it emerged that Black, under the name Grant Freeman, had previously pleaded guilty to assault, after breaking her then-wife’s jaw. (Upon transitioning after the attack, Black took the ex-wife’s first name.) Wiener argues that transgender women face violence, too, and should not be treated as an inherent threat. “I think anyone who is harassing anyone or engaging in weird, creepy, inappropriate behavior in a locker room, in a group bathroom, something should be done about that,” Wiener tells me, “whether that is a cis man, cis woman, trans man. That should not be tolerated.” Transgender people who want to get on with their lives without harassment and abuse should not suffer because of the actions of the occasional creep, he says.\n\nThe argument isn’t about what policies he supports, he says, because he has never proposed a bill about restrooms or locker rooms specifically. “The triggering thing I said on that stage,” he said, referring to the event where Hyman and others criticized him, “is trans women are women, and they fundamentally dispute that.”\n\nIf California Governor Gavin Newsom runs for president, he will have to answer for the state’s many gender-related policies championed by Wiener, such as adding a nonbinary option to driver’s licenses. Wiener also proposed S.B. 357, which repealed California’s law criminalizing loitering with intent to commit prostitution. He has argued that this prevents young people, in many cases members of sexual or racial minorities, from being hassled by police; the Times recently reported that the new approach hampered police attempts to find underage girls working on the streets.\n\nLegislation like this has made Wiener a frequent target of MAGA influencers such as Libs of TikTok. In 2024, an account called “End Wokeness” posted a description of his voting record over the Folsom Street Fair photo, alongside another with Kamala Harris. Elon Musk, the owner of X, reposted it with the comment: “Wiener is an utter scumbag.”\n\nPerhaps because of the nastiness of the attacks, Wiener tends toward a knee-jerk dismissal of people who disagree with him on these issues. He told me that the MAGA information universe that amplified Tish Hyman hates him as “the gay Jew from San Francisco who thinks trans kids are, like, full human beings.” I objected that there is also a liberal criticism that gender-questioning teens who might need talk therapy are being put on a medical pathway. We went back and forth. He said that all the American medical associations support puberty blockers; I noted that systematic evidence reviews, such as those commissioned for Britain’s exhaustive Cass Report, do not. He said that the Cass Report was “debunked.” I replied that one critical paper on the Yale Law School website—not peer-reviewed, and written in part by doctors who prescribe these treatments themselves—is not a debunking. He argued that gender surgeries on minors are rare (true) and that regret rates are low (we don’t know, because the institutions that made experimental gender treatments mainstream did not pause to collect systematic data).\n\nIn general, Wiener seems more patient with those who criticize him over Gaza than with people who part with him on gender. I asked him about that difference: Just as the abusive, disruptive pro-Palestinian activists might nonetheless have a fair point about Netanyahu’s policies, aren’t some of the concerns about single-sex spaces and puberty blockers worth hearing out, even if Libs of TikTok is awful to him? He didn’t bite.\n\nStill, you don’t have to agree with him on everything to realize that he’s making a fundamentally different calculation from applause-driven careerists. One of the reasons that you can argue with Wiener—or shout at him, if your politics dictate that approach—is that he has strong beliefs and argues them bravely, even when they are unpopular. He fights, he loses, and he fights again until he wins.","summary":"Scott Wiener—a pro-trans Zionist who wants California to allow more homes—has an extreme tolerance for pushback.","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/scott-wiener-yimby-shouted-at/685566/","image":"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/vGgkk7__-4v0hbPvaFMQva5stHU=/1x0:3999x2249/720x405/media/img/mt/2026/01/2026_01_11_Scott_Wiener_the_Countrys_Most_Shouted_At_Politician/original.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-11 12:00:00","author":"Helen Lewis","authors":["Helen Lewis"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.169},{"id":392276904,"title":"'You cannot break us': Protesters rally in Minneapolis after ICE fatal shooting","text":"MINNEAPOLIS — Thousands gathered in Minneapolis on Saturday to push back on the Trump administration's deployment of federal forces after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed a woman earlier this week. \n\nPeople held signs with the face of Renee Good, the 37-year-old mother who was shot in the head on Wednesday, while calling for ICE to get out of their city. \n\n\"Nobody should be taken off the streets,\" Emily Sanderson, who was attending the demonstration, told The Canadian Press. \"Nobody should be murdered in the streets. It's irrational. It's disgusting.\"\n\nThe massive protest marked the latest demonstration that has gripped the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, which have become the main target of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown. \n\nDaily protests have taken place since the fatal shooting, with local and state representatives calling for ICE to leave to allow tensions to lower. \n\nThe Trump administration has said the ICE officer was acting in self-defence and Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem pledged that federal forces will stay in the state. \n\nThere are about 2,000 officers deployed in the area, which the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said is its largest immigration operation, and more are expected to arrive.\n\nThe size of Saturday's rally did not deter federal forces, who were spotted not far away conducting identity checks. \n\nEarlier Saturday morning, Minnesota Democrats said they were denied entry into the ICE processing facility in Minneapolis. \n\nRep. Angie Craig called the Trump administration \"lawless.\" She called ICE a \"rogue agency\" and said it's inciting more violence in the community.\n\n\"They are not going to remove ICE from Minnesota unless Minnesotans reach out and get through to my Republican colleagues to help them understand they need to put pressure on this administration,\" Craig told reporters outside the facility. \"This should not be partisan.\"\n\nRep. Ilhan Omar, a Somali-American member who has repeatedly faced derogatory comments from President Donald Trump, posted on social media that members of Congress \"have a legal right and constitutional responsibility to conduct oversight where people are being detained.\"\n\n\"The public deserves to know what is taking place in ICE facilities,\" Omar said. \n\nAt Saturday's protest, residents said they felt caught up in a political battle. Ellen Hinck, a teacher who attended the rally, said it's not surprising that Minnesota was targeted.\n\n\"The plan has been there. They are targeting blue states,\" Hinck said. \"They want to try and make us into what they want by using oppression. We are not going to let that happen.\" \n\nMinnesota was a political flashpoint before the shooting. Trump has made multiple verbal attacks on Gov. Tim Walz — former vice-president Kamala Harris's 2024 running mate in the presidential race — and derogatory remarks toward the state's Somali population.\n\nEli Wagar-Kustermann said he attended Saturday's rally to show solidarity. \n\n\"We are Minnesota strong,\" he said. \"You will not break us. You cannot break us.\"\n\nLike many others who attended the large protest, he said it's been unnerving seeing federal agents with their faces covered show up in parking lots and on residential streets. Before attending the rally, he took photos of ICE officers who he said were harassing people at a store.\n\n\"We are straight up under occupation,\" Wagar-Kustermann said. \n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Jan. 10, 2026. \n\nKelly Geraldine Malone, The Canadian Press","url":"https://www.oakvillenews.org/national-news/you-cannot-break-us-protesters-rally-in-minneapolis-after-ice-fatal-shooting-11723429","image":"https://www.vmcdn.ca/f/files/shared/feeds/cp/2026/01/62d5bf3b9eac66430780be0fd341db7bf7275ae03861db58e2844c298940290f.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-11 05:44:07","author":"The Canadian Press","authors":["The Canadian Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.462},{"id":392278686,"title":"Saturday's Final Word","text":"Tabs, don't go away mad, tabs, just go away ...\n\n🔴 BREAKING:Tehran tonight.

May their freedom be at hand.\n\nSimon Sebag Montefiore at the Free Press: Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader of Iran who occupies a role akin to a sacred monarch, issued a grave warning to the public on Friday. “Everyone knows the Islamic Republic came to power with the blood of hundreds of thousands of honorable people,” he said. “It will not back down in the face of saboteurs.”\n\nKhamenei defied Donald Trump, comparing him to the “tyrants & arrogant rulers of the world, such as Pharaoh, Nimrod, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi [the last shah] & other such rulers [who] saw their downfall when they were at the peak of their hubris. He too will fall.” His absence of self-awareness speaks of the regime’s isolation, delusion, and brutality. Khamenei has been a dictator since 1989, during which time he has brutally repressed multiple waves of protest with indiscriminate slaughter, rape, and public hangings, not to mention his role in wars in Gaza, Lebanon, Syria, and Iraq.\n\nWe are at a historic moment, a tilt in the world game and a rare spark of hope and excitement. The bravery of these Iranian protestors is awe-inspiring—particularly the women and girls, who have played a special courageous role. This time, among the greatest heroes are the heroines, personified in part by the dashing young woman who filmed herself lighting a cigarette with a burning photograph of the supreme leader. That is the spirit that is setting Iran aflame.\n\nEd: Bookmark this lengthy essay and read it carefully. It's a great history lesson, as well as a cautionary tale as well as reason to hope that this tyranny has just about breathed its last. The best part of this essay is an analysis of what a collapse of an Islamist regime might mean for the region – not a so-called Arab Spring that enables more radical Islamists, but the dismantling of a geopolitical order oriented to the Moscow-Beijing axis. \n\nCan you find me one “Free Palestine” charlatan demanding a Free Iran? pic.twitter.com/ZHApOqxLjU— John Ondrasik (@johnondrasik) January 10, 2026\n\nEd: Call it the Silence of the Shams.\n\nTelegraph (UK): A protester climbed onto the balcony of the Iranian embassy in London and tore down the regime’s flag.\n\nImages shared on social media showed the protester scaling the front of the building opposite Hyde Park before climbing onto a balcony and raising the “Lion and Sun” flag of Imperial Iran, which has long been banned by the regime. ...\n\nThe man was cheered by hundreds of opposition activists and their supporters who had gathered in front of the embassy, site of the famous siege of 1980 when an SAS unit stormed the building to liberate hostages taken by an armed group.\n\nEd: The historic resonance here is notable. Also, if a protester can manage to do this at the Iranian embassy, their security must be very concerned with other tasks. I wonder how much smoke is pouring out the chimney there as the IRGC intelligence officials destroy records and codes. \n\nIncredible stuff in London where the pre Islamic Republic flag has been hoisted over the embassy.📹@GhorbaniiNiyakpic.twitter.com/MwoJCxI3Qz— Nicole Lampert (@nicolelampert) January 10, 2026\n\nEd: This may be an iconic moment and image. Let's hope. \n\nWSJ: Israel and Hamas are preparing for renewed fighting as the Palestinian militant group is refusing to disarm, a requirement that is holding up progress on President Trump’s peace plan for Gaza. \n\nIsrael’s military has drawn up plans for a new ground operation inside Hamas-controlled territory in Gaza, according to people briefed on the plans. Hamas is focusing on rebuilding military capabilities lost during the war, including parts of its damaged tunnel infrastructure, Arab and Israeli officials said. The U.S.-designated terrorist group also has received a new influx of cash that has helped it regularly pay salaries to its fighters again, the officials said.\n\nEd: As everyone here knows, I've predicted this all along. I include it here because (a) it looks like the Israelis are about to finally act on Hamas' refusal to comply, and (b) the collapse of the regime in Tehran will come at the worst time possible for Hamas. \n\nWe’ve gone from gaslighting to full-on blowtorch at this point. The ICE agent told Good get out of the car, not leave. An outright lie MS Now is helping to push. https://t.co/tlnbUZlmfv— Joe Concha (@JoeConchaTV) January 10, 2026\n\nEd: Say, remember when M-SNOW insisted that the car never hit the ICE agent, too? They are making it up as they go along. \n\nScott Johnson at WashEx: Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN) abandoned his ludicrous quest for a third term on Jan. 5. He has angrily refused to resign from office. Whenever he departs, whether upon his resignation some time this year or the expiration of his term early next year, we can say this much with certainty: Like former President Joe Biden, he has become a dispensable inconvenience to Democrats, in this case, Minnesota Democrats facing the 2026 elections at all levels of state government, and, like Biden, he will leave office in disgrace.\n\nTo say that Walz is the worst governor in Minnesota history does not come close to doing justice to his case. Like the children of Garrison Keillor’s fictional Lake Wobegon, our governors have mostly been above average, with a dip here and there. Walz has plumbed the depths of political turpitude while refusing to take responsibility for the catastrophe over which he at least bears supervisory responsibility. He is at best guilty of an old-fashioned kind of political corruption that has been magnified to the nth degree by an absurdly creative welfare state. We have never seen anything like it.\n\nEd: If Walz ever faces accountability for the massive fraud enabled by his administration, Scott will be one of the people who deserves the most credit for it. He has written about it for years. The media has finally begun to cover these stories, only because Scott and others forced the story into the national consciousness. For that, we may also have to thank Kamala Harris, ironically. \n\nThis whole protest in Minnesota was I think doomed to failure from the start, in large part because the crowd was made up overwhelmingly of upper class young white people. Scenes of affluent young white folk rioting aren’t good optics for the left and they know it… hard to argue… https://t.co/x30vHWpoAE— Enguerrand VII de Coucy (@ingelramdecoucy) January 10, 2026\n\nEd: It's also very cold in Minnesota in January. At noon today, it was 21 degrees outside with the wind chill taking it down to 7 degrees. However, I'd also guess that the release of the agent's cellphone video yesterday made this protest a lot harder to sustain. Plus, the usual suspects may be worried about Trump invoking the Insurrection Act.\n\nHollywood in Toto: Kimmel didn’t correct the record or otherwise indicate she was wrong. He’s not a journalist, per se, but by regularly wading into political matters he’s become part of the punditry class. He should know better, and he’s doing a disservice to his audience by not separating fact from fiction when possible.\n\nAnd who knows what other misinformation he’ll peddle next, all with a corrupt Legacy Media unwilling to call him out.\n\nIs Disney, Inc. proud of these broadcasts? Are they worried some will open them up to sizable lawsuits sooner or later?\n\nMore importantly, is anyone at Team Disney upset that their signature shows misinform at a delicate time in our Republic?\n\nIf silence is any indication, we have our answer.\n\nEd: My theory is that Kimmel took the proper message from his oddly short contract extension and knows Disney will dump him in the off-year when it expires. He wants Disney to fire him early so he can pose as a free-speech martyr. Maybe Disney's being smart by ignoring Kimmel while cutting his budget. \n\nThe demonization of the ICE officers LAWFUL RESPONSE TO HER CRIME is all in service of the effort to force the Trump Admin. to abandon its policy of mass deportations from the sancturary communities that are critical to holding onto voting advantages in elections, as well as…— Shipwreckedcrew (@shipwreckedcrew) January 10, 2026\n\n... as well as population counts done for the census.This is about DEMOCRATS WANTING TO REGAIN AND HOLD POLITICAL POWER.They really don't care about Ms. Good dying as a result of their hyperbolic exhortations. All in service of the cause -- which is power.\n\nEd: This is exactly what's happening. Democrats have opposed immigration enforcement for decades, and then threw open the border to make it even more difficult if and when Republicans took control of the White House. They didn't count on Trump's return, nor on his determination to reverse what Democrats did in the previous four years. \n\nLegal Insurrection: With protests surging across cities and towns across Iran, the regime has reportedly unleashed foreign fighters to crack down on protesters. The U.S. State Department raised the alarm about Lebanon’s Hezbollah and Iraqi terror militia set loose on Iranians.\n\n“The United States is concerned by reports that the Islamic Republic has employed Hezbollah terrorists and Iraqi militias to crack down on peaceful protests,” State Department’s Persian-language account on X said on Saturday.\n\nEd: There had been reports of the regime's proxies heading quickly to the home office, as it were.

Sign up for their newsletters.\n\nLast month, as required by law, State Auditor Grant Parks published an annual report on state programs and agencies that his office deems to be at “high risk” of costly inefficiency, waste or fraud.\n\nThe report reiterated concerns about seven situations, two of which have been on the list since 2007, including the bureaucracy’s chronic inability to successfully employ information technology — embarrassing for a state that is the global center for digital tools.\n\nParks has added a new program in his latest overview, the Department of Social Service’s food aid for poor families, once called food stamps but now known as CalFresh.\n\nThe federal government primarily finances supplemental food benefits, but the state’s share is determined, in part, by its management, as indicated by its rate of error when determining people’s eligibility.\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill tightens the error rate thresholds. Thus, Parks notes, California’s 11% error rate, if not improved, could require the state to “spend about $2 billion annually to maintain CalFresh benefits.”\n\nThe most disturbing item on Parks’ list is the continuing inability of the Employment Development Department to effectively manage unemployment insurance benefits, which first came to light during the COVID-19 pandemic. Billions of dollars in fraudulent benefit claims were approved, almost all of which came in a federally financed expansion of the program.\n\nBy happenstance, the high risk report was released just as a scandal was erupting in Minnesota over widespread fraud in a program meant to keep children fed during the pandemic.\n\nDozens of people, mostly in Minnesota’s substantial Somali population, have been charged with looting the program by setting up companies that billed the state for supplying food that was never delivered.\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz, whom Kamala Harris chose as her running mate in her campaign for president in 2024, felt the political fallout from the scandal — generated mostly in right-leaning media outlets — and this week dropped his bid for re-election.\n\nMeanwhile, those same outlets — blogs, podcasts and YouTube videos — have been making an accusatory connection between the Minnesota scandal and the Parks report, suggesting the report proves the same kind of fraud was even more rampant in California and laying the blame on Gov. Gavin Newsom, who’s a likely 2028 candidate for president.\n\nThis week, Steve Hilton, a Republican candidate for California governor, and Herb Morgan, a Republican running for state controller, cited the Parks report, their own research and tips from whistleblowers in a broad assertion, dubbed “CALIFRAUDIA,” that “California’s exposure to fraud, waste, and abuse across major state programs is likely to reach $250 billion,” adding that it “underscores the urgent need for formal investigation and audit, as a matter of basic fiscal responsibility.”\n\nHowever, the allegations of widespread fraud and mismanagement during Newsom’s governorship is not confined to those on the starboard side of the political balance beam.\n\nRo Khanna, a progressive Democratic member of Congress from Silicon Valley who could be a rival to Newsom in the 2028 presidential sweepstakes, issued a similar blast in a posting on X, albeit with a smaller $72 billion pricetag, citing Parks’ report and other data.\n\nKhanna told Politico, “I don’t know what the specific number is” of dollars lost to fraud or mismanagement. “It’s not particular to any person,” Khanna said. “It’s making government more effective. Tackling the mismanagement and waste and some fraud will build more credibility for asking for higher taxes.”\n\nNewsom’s staff responded by accusing Khanna of making a “MAGA made-up claim.”\n\nThere’s a reason why veterans of political wars refer to election years as the “silly season,” when political figures seeking media attention are prone to convert anthills of fact into mountains of rhetorical fantasy.\n\nCalMatters is a nonpartisan and nonprofit news organization bringing Californians stories that probe, explain and explore solutions to quality of life issues while holding our leaders accountable.\n\nWant to submit a letter to the editor, guest column or opinion piece?

The suspect is claiming self-defense while Florida police investigate.\n\nThe shooting comes at a difficult time for the Secret Service, which has struggled with manpower issues and low morale for more than a decade. Recruiting and retention took further hits after the two assassination attempts against President Trump in 2024, when many senior agents who had hit retirement age left the agency amid harsh criticism from the public and Congress over the myriad failures in both attempts on Trump’s life.\n\nThe agency has recently touted improvements in its recruiting efforts after offering $40,000-$60,000 of dollars in recruiting bonuses, but has not responded to repeated RealClearPolitics inquiries about its retention rates. Earlier this week, Secret Service Director Sean Curran met with United Marine Corps Sergeant Major Carlos Ruiz to collaborate on ways Marines could continue service to their country after leaving the military.\n\nThis week, the Secret Service announced plans to hire 4,000 employees over the next two years and cut its hiring timelines in half. But long-time observers warned that speeding up the hiring process would undoubtedly result in less training and the hiring of less qualified individuals.\n\nUntil the investigation into the killing concludes, the Broward County Sheriff’s Office is not releasing the suspect’s name. RealClearPolitics is withholding the suspects’ and victims’ names until the Broward County State Attorney’s Office determines whether to file criminal charges.\n\nFlorida has a robust “stand-your-ground” law, which allows individuals to use reasonable, even deadly, force to defend themselves from imminent threats or death or serious harm without a legal duty to retreat.\n\nShortly after 10 p.m. on Dec. 31, Broward County Regional Communications received a report of a shooting in the Tamarac, Florida area.\n\nWhen police and fire rescue arrived, they located a 16-year-old male, who had been shot. The juvenile was airlifted to Broward Health Medical Center, where he was later pronounced dead. An adult woman suffered a graze wound and was treated at the scene, the sheriff’s office said. The shooter remained on the scene, was detained for questioning, “presented a self-defense claim,” and was later released.\n\nThe Secret Service hired the suspect in late fall, and he was scheduled to begin agent training at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in early to mid-January.\n\n“The United States Secret Service is aware of an open investigation by the Broward County Sheriff’s Office that involves a recently hired special agent trainee, who was awaiting entry into an upcoming training academy,” the agency said in a statement to RCP. “This is an extremely tragic situation, and we are fully cooperating with the Broward Sheriff’s Office as they lead this investigation.\n\n“Once completed, the results of the independent review will be presented to the Florida State Attorney’s Office,” the agency continued. “… Any additional questions related to the investigation itself should be directed to the Broward Sheriff’s Office. The employee under investigation has been placed on administrative leave as the process moves forward.” \n\nFormer agents and other sources in the Secret Service community have recently criticized the agency for lowering standards in recruiting, arguing that misplaced DEI initiatives were given priority during the Obama and Biden administrations, and former law enforcement experience was not valued as much as in previous years, when the agency had a better reputation and protection record.\n\nSome have also argued that Curran isn’t doing enough to rid the agency of DEI hires and woke culture, which one agent has publicly blamed for the near-killing of Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nOther agents have raised concerns over the Secret Service’s decades-long policy of not requiring psychological exams as part of the hiring process – unlike most police departments across the country. Doing so would prevent any type of insider threats to the president or other protectees, these sources argue.\n\nMany of these complaints have circulated for more than a decade. Former GOP Rep. Jason Chaffetz, who served as the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, held numerous hard-hitting hearings on the failures of the Secret Service after the 2012 Colombia prostitution scandal involving several agents who were caught with prostitutes during the Obama administration. Chaffetz was also highly critical of several White House fence-jumping incidents – so much so that the fence surrounding the complex was raised.\n\nIn 2015, Chaffetz and committee staff also produced a detailed, bipartisan report on “The Secret Service in Crisis,” which recommended numerous reforms, many of which the agency has yet to implement. \n\nThree months before the assassination attempt against Trump in Butler, RCP reported on a female agent’s mental health meltdown and physical attack on her supervisor, which took place at Joint Base Andrews, before a planned trip protecting then-Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nLast year, the agency spent $2 million on a Super Bowl recruitment video by Hollywood producer Michael Bay in which Curran is prominently featured. The expenditure came after hundreds of agents applied for lateral transfer to the Drug Enforcement Agency.\n\nThe agents are working harder than ever at what many argue is an unsustainable pace after the previous acting director, Ron Rowe, promised “a paradigm shift” post-Butler – that they would not have to continue “doing more with less,” a common refrain in the Secret Service over the last decade.\n\nThe vice-presidential detail is especially taxed because JD Vance travels much more than his predecessor, Kamala Harris, but the agency has kept the number of agents assigned to it at similar levels. One source tells RCP that vice presidential agents work five to six days a week, while Trump’s detail works two to three days.\n\nSusan Crabtree is RealClearPolitics' national political correspondent.","summary":"Anew Secret Service agent recruit shot and killed his 16-year-old half-brother and may have been responsible for another bullet grazing a woman's face on New Year's Eve.

He noted that former United States Vice President Kamala Harris previously lived in the same building before moving out after her election, selling her two-bedroom apartment for about $1.85 million at the time.\n\nHe added that while it is unclear whether Mr Ofori-Atta owns or rents the apartment, sources indicate that he had been living there until the morning of January 6, when authorities reportedly surrounded the building and took him into custody.\n\nManasseh further disclosed that the arrest occurred at about 11 a.m. on Tuesday as the former finance minister was exiting the building.\n\n“He was arrested at the Westlight building, which is located at 1111,24th Street in Northwest Washington, D.C., and we are told this is a very expensive residential area in Washington, D.C., located about 20 minutes’ walk from the White House.\n\n“Some of the people who have lived in this facility include the immediate past Vice President of the United States, Kamala Harris. She had a two-bedroom apartment in this building and moved out when she was elected Vice President. We know the cost of that facility, I mean, the two-bedroom apartment in that complex, she sold it for $1.85 million at the time she was leaving.\n\n“So we’re told it’s a very expensive facility, secure, and prominent people live there. We don’t know whether Ken Ofori-Atta has bought the facility or he’s renting, but sources say this is where he’s been living, going in and out, until the morning of January 6, when the authorities surrounded him and drove him to his current detention centre,” he said.\n\nHe added that the manner of the arrest suggests it was a targeted operation, noting that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is typically associated with mass arrests in public places.\n\n“When we talk about ICE, I think those who watch foreign news and sometimes social media, these officials go around to enforce the immigration policy of the US. So most of their activity, sometimes they go to public places, factories, and other places to do mass sweeps and arrests. But in the case of Ken Ofori-Atta, we are hearing it was like a targeted operation.\n\n“It wasn’t like a mass sweep, and as we know, this is a high-end residential complex. So it appears they went there purposely to arrest him, and once they got him into the car, they moved,”he added.","url":"https://citinewsroom.com/2026/01/manasseh-ofori-attas-arrest-was-targeted/","image":"https://citinewsroom.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Manasseh-Azure.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-10 15:18:37","author":"Isaac Appiah-Kubi","authors":["Isaac Appiah-Kubi"],"language":"en","source_country":"gh","sentiment":-0.362},{"id":392267634,"title":"GREGG JARRETT: If Walz is charged in Minnesota fraud scandal, his best defense is incompetence","text":"\"I hereby plead incompetence and stupidity.\" That’s probably the best defense that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz can offer if he is criminally charged in the shocking multi-billion-dollar taxpayer ripoffs that grow larger by the day. Given his earned reputation, his excuse of incompetence would be credible. Nearly every social service program receiving federal dollars was fleeced by fraudsters right under Walz’s nose, including child nutrition, daycare, healthcare, housing, and autism aid. Most of the perpetrators were Somalians who form a powerful voting block that the governor treasures like gold. EMMER WARNS WALZ COULD END UP 'IN CUFFS' AMID MINNESOTA FRAUD CLAIMS Walz was repeatedly warned of the swindles as far back as 2019 when he first took office. Instead of stopping the scams and prosecuting the grifters, he indulged them by establishing a culture of permissible fraud. The scandal has already claimed Walz’s political career, forcing him to abandon his bid for re-election. But if he reckoned that quitting would somehow shield him from legal culpability, he is mistaken. There is mounting evidence that Walz was willfully complicit, deliberately refusing to expose or pursue the monumental thefts and, instead, launching aggressive measures to scuttle any legal scrutiny and criminal consequence. The governor’s own state workers at the Department of Human Services issued a blistering statement blaming him as 100% responsible. Witnesses say he retaliated against whistleblowers and schemed to discredit the well-documented fraud reports. WALZ’S LONG-RUNNING FRAUD SCANDAL PUTS HARRIS CAMPAIGN JUDGMENT UNDER SCRUTINY If true, Walz’s aberrant actions run dangerously close to criminal behavior involving cover-ups and obstruction. Nine federal agencies, including the FBI, are now working to unravel the full breadth and depth of the colossal cons. The Department of Justice (DOJ) has sent scores of investigators and lawyers to Minnesota to prosecute the web of fraud and deceit. They will inevitably weigh whether Walz should face criminal charges himself. MINNESOTA AG BLASTS HOUSE HEARING ON FRAUD SCANDAL IN HIS STATE : 'A LOT OF BULLS--- FROM REPUBLICANS' Possible Federal Charges There are several federal statutes to consider. For example, 18 USC 371 makes it a crime to conspire with others to defraud the government. At present, there is no known evidence that Walz directly participated in the scams themselves or accepted money. However, if he plotted to cover up the fraud by impairing, obstructing or defeating efforts to bring the fraudsters to justice, the conspiracy statute is applicable. So, too, are the various obstruction of justice laws. JASON CHAFFETZ: DEMOCRATS TURNED OUR TREASURY INTO A ‘PIGGY BANK FOR FRAUDSTERS’ There is also 18 USC 2, the aiding and abetting statute where accomplices are treated the same as the main perpetrators. That law gave rise to the \"willful blindness doctrine\" recognized by our courts. An example is a businessman who intentionally ignores or turns a blind eye to his partner’s money laundering, resulting in charges against both. Similarly, a public official such as Walz can be indicted for deliberate inaction where he has a clear duty to act. Finally, 18 USC 3 is relevant whenever concealment occurs. Whoever knows that a crime has been committed but \"hinders apprehension, trial or punishment,\" is guilty of being an accessory after the fact. That bears a striking resemblance to what Walz is accused of doing. FROM CONGRESS, TO VP NOMINEE TO DISGRACED FORMER GOVERNOR: A LOOK AT THE RISE AND FALL OF TIM WALZ All of this invites the question of the governor’s motive. If not money, how did he stand to benefit by suppressing the avalanche of fraud? That’s the easy part. Votes. Walz, together with liberal elites and their media handmaidens, have long dismissed the rumors and reports of Somali-engineered fraud as \"racist.\" Apparently, in Minnesota it is politically incorrect to enforce the law against immigrants from that particular East African country. It’s just not fashionable. God forbid that putting criminals behind bars might lose electoral support. It’s chic to turn the other cheek. REP TOM EMMER: WALZ OVERSAW BILLIONS IN STOLEN TAXPAYER MONEY — NOW COMES ACCOUNTABILITY So, the Somalian fraudsters were gifted a \"get-out-of-jail\" free card, courtesy of the governor and his cronies. Walz, in turn, secured their votes. It was a nifty quid pro quo, but with an alternate currency — votes. As protection rackets go, it was slick. That cozy arrangement is manifested in a recently uncovered audio recording of a 2021 conversation between Walz’s Attorney General Keith Ellison and Somali hustlers who were soon after convicted of scamming millions of dollars. They were heard leaning hard on the AG to \"protect\" them in exchange for support and campaign donations. Ellison eagerly capitulated but now denies any wrongdoing. He returned the cash. Walz’s Incompetence Defense It is too early to know whether a criminal case will be filed against Minnesota’s beleaguered governor. The U.S. attorney and DOJ lawyers are still digging through the mountains of evidence. However, as noted above, the only tenable defense Walz may be able to conjure up is incompetence and stupidity. It is something that jurors might readily accept. SCATHING AUDIT REVEALS MORE FRAUD CONCERNS INSIDE TOP MINNESOTA AGENCY WITH FABRICATED DOCUMENTS, 'MISCONDUCT' After all, ineptitude became the governor’s calling card. He infamously conceded his own buffoonery in the 2024 Vice Presidential debate when he called himself a \"knucklehead.\" He was such a gaffe factory that the Kamala Harris campaign squirreled him away from the media. Walz achieved the impossible. He made his running mate look like a genius. His bizarre on-stage antics were constant fodder for mockery. Baffling verbal goofs, such as boasting that he had \"become friends with school shooters,\" left voters scratching their heads or snickering. A series of demonstrable lies about his military service and his peculiar treks to China only compounded the impression of a man who is either a serial fabricator or not right in the head. Maybe both are true. And who can forget his epic bungling of the George Floyd riots in 2020? He radicalized the tragic death, thereby ginning up the ensuing violence. As Minneapolis burned, Walz dithered. Afterwards, he blamed the looting and the torched buildings on systemic racism.

It’s a distinction that can mean the difference between conviction and acquittal.

Tim Walz pulled out the smears last May at a law-school graduation. The agents of Immigrations and Custom Enforcement (ICE) were \"Trump’s modern-day Gestapo,\" \"scooping folks up off the streets.\" It had been Joe Biden’s ICE just four months earlier. How quickly can an agency descend into fascism? The national broadcast networks never found that objectionable or newsworthy. The \"independent fact-checkers\" yawned. Comparing President Donald Trump to Hitler is 24/7 Democrat messaging. Comparing law-enforcement agencies to storm troopers is perfectly fine – when the Democrats aren’t in charge of them. It’s become clear that Democrats from Walz on down don’t just oppose mass deportation. They oppose any deportations. They don’t welcome cooperation with ICE. They push resistance against ICE. Because ICE is now relentlessly demonized, it shouldn’t be surprising that they’ve been on the receiving end of violence. The broadcast networks yawn. In September in Chicago, an illegal alien ran over and dragged an ICE agent in Chicago until the alien was shot dead. But there was no sympathy for the dragged agent on ABC, CBS, NBC or PBS. COLBERT WARNS TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS IMPOSING AN 'OBEY OR DIE' DOCTRINE ON AMERICANS Last December in St. Paul, Minn., an illegal alien allegedly ran over an ICE agent and bit another agent when he was apprehended. The national networks showed they don’t care. They didn’t bring that up after the latest incident. The death of Renee Nicole Good when she threatened to drive into an ICE agent is a tragedy. If activists like Good wanted to protest ICE by showing up wherever they seek to enforce the law and film it on their phones, that’s in our First Amendment tradition. But it’s a crime to get involved in trying to impede law enforcement activity. Everyone knew how the broadcast networks would cover this death, with massive energy and outrage. That didn’t happen for women killed by illegal immigrants. We can guess the elitist media would say these murders were atypical for illegal immigrants. But using that logic, apparently ICE shooting a protester is typical for them? ICE AGENTS REPORT ‘UNPRECEDENTED’ 3,200% SURGE IN CAR ATTACKS LAST YEAR The broadcast networks didn’t care about 12-year-old Jocelyn Nungaray being raped and murdered, or the rape and murder of Maryland mom Rachel Morin. When they gave 20 minutes to the trial of Laken Riley’s illegal-immigrant killer last November, it paled in comparison to the 78 minutes the networks gave a little-known comedian at a Trump rally last October calling Puerto Rico \"a floating island of garbage.\" They were all trying to get former Vice President Kamala Harris and Walz into the White House. Not everyone let Democrats rant without a challenge, like Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey demanding ICE \"get the f--- out of Minneapolis.\" Newly minted \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Tony Dokoupil asked Frey: \"The rhetoric we just heard, other things you have said, you've now got protesters in the streets saying things like ‘Nazis go home.’ How are you helping the situation calm down?\" Frey basically said he won’t: \"What I appreciate about this situation right now is we in Minneapolis are all singing with one accord, which is, one, we are going to stand up for our immigrant community. Two, we are going to keep people safe.\" Democrats routinely call illegal immigrants \"our neighbors,\" our \"immigrant community,\" and describe opposing deportation as \"keeping people safe.\" Frey and the others say ICE isn’t stopping crime, it’s engaged in crime, it’s \"sowing chaos.\" Radicals impeding ICE activity aren’t engaged in chaos, but in \"keeping people safe.\" All of that sounds Orwellian. But don’t call activists like Good \"radical.\" The press pretends she was \"just a mom.\" On NBC’s \"Today,\" reporter Maggie Vespa broke out the \"without evidence\" claim: \"The Trump administration defending his actions, including Vice President JD Vance in a rare appearance in the White House Briefing Room saying without evidence that [Renee] Good was radicalized ... white local officials, including the city's mayor, dispute the Trump administration's narrative.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Whenever these networks say \"without evidence,\" it’s because they didn’t look. The New York Post reported Good was an anti-ICE \"warrior\" who sent her son to Southside Family Charter School, a K-5 academy opened in 1972 that, from its inception, has been \"unabashedly dedicated to social justice education.\" Everyone knew how the broadcast networks would cover this death, with massive energy and outrage. That didn’t happen for women killed by illegal immigrants. The broadcast networks didn’t just rant against Trump and ICE on the newscasts. Speaking of Venezuela, ABC \"comedian\" Jimmy Kimmel brought out a red T-shirt, \"They’re trying out a new slogan: ‘DONALD J. TRUMP IS GONNA KILL YOU.’ Pretty good, right?\" Moving on to Minneapolis, Kimmel retorted, \"This maniac, he isn't just killing people overseas. An ICE agent today shot and killed an unarmed 37-year-old woman during an ICE operation in Minneapolis, who were there under the guise of protecting us.\" CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP On ABC’s \"The View,\" they took their loathing of Trump to a new level, scaring their own audience after the Minneapolis shooting. Cohost Whoopi Goldberg asserted, \"That young lady could have been anybody in this audience. It doesn't matter what — forget color. Forget everything. It could have been anybody, and if they can do this to her, they can do it to you, too.\" You can count on these networks to avoid left-wing rhetorical excess – when they’re not engaged in it. Accounts on X circulated video of a protest in New York’s Foley Square where they chanted \"Kristi Noem will Hang!\" and \"Save a life, kill an ICE!\" You might call it the spirit of the post-George Floyd riots of 2020 and the networks won’t disparage it. They’ll use it to announce \"growing outrage tonight\" against ICE and Trump.

[Checks out the ol’ news.] Ah well.\n\nWe may be a little rusty, so bear with us. This week, Donald Trump fantasized about which Western Hemisphere landmasses he can conquer next. Tim Walz can’t catch a break ever since he inserted himself into national politics. A solution for expired health care subsidies remains mired in the limbo of a dreaded Senate working group.\n\nAnd while we were hoping to lead with a “fun one” in this return edition, that wasn’t in the cards.\n\nStephen Miller\n\nICE is becoming too big to fail.\n\nOn Wednesday in Minnesota, 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good was in her car, perpendicular to traffic, during an Immigration and Customs Enforcement operation in Minneapolis. An agent approached her and demanded she get out of the car. As that officer began trying to open her door, another approached from the other side. Good tried to drive away, turning her wheels right to avoid the officer who had approached from the other side. As the officer tried to get out of the way, he fired multiple shots from feet away and killed Good. We can’t predict how a court of law would judge the officer’s self-defense argument. But the naked eye tells that this was an overuse of force.\n\nThis administration, though, can’t afford you believing the naked eye. It has a lot riding on ICE. Anti-immigrant zealot Stephen Miller, who runs White House policy—or, really, just runs the White House—pushed with all of his might to secure a mammoth expansion of ICE capacity and personnel in last summer’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. A supersized ICE is Miller’s tool to implement mass deportations. And so, a scandal in which an ICE officer unnecessarily shoots someone in the face, which could threaten public support for Miller’s grand ICE project, is not something the administration can afford.\n\nThis is why the administration went from zero to she was a terrorist in about 10 seconds. Miller described Good’s driving as “domestic terrorism,” intended to run over officers, a line echoed by the Department of Homeland Security’s spokesperson and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem herself. Vice President J.D. Vance performed a hammy scolding of the media for daring to question the officer’s actions during Thursday’s White House press briefing. The response was quick and well over-the-top. It was high-stakes crisis communications to protect Miller’s dream for America.\n\nDonald Trump\n\nWe really shouldn’t buy Greenland, either.\n\nFeeling his imperialist oats after having kidnapped a head of state so that he could take the country’s natural resources, Trump has once again turned his attention to Greenland, a large ice sheet controlled by the Kingdom of Denmark that Trump wants to annex because it looks really big on a distorted map. Trump reiterated early in the week that “we need Greenland” and his press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, observed that “utilizing the U.S. military is always an option” that Trump could use to secure it. Our good friend Stephen Miller, meanwhile, gave a characteristically unhinged interview, saying that the U.S. has a right to take Greenland because “we live in a world, in the real world … that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power. These are the iron laws of the world since the beginning of time.” Buddy, this is CNN, not an Xbox headset.\n\nAt least there’s been reasonable pushback, with European leaders formally condemning the saber-rattling and observing that an attack on Greenland would mean the end of NATO (perhaps a feature, for elements of Trump’s administration). Senate Republicans, by Senate Republican standards, have also been forceful in their rejection of the idea. One possible defense of what Trump’s doing, though, is making threats as a means of getting Denmark to put Greenland up for sale. Can we observe, before the savvy negotiator spin takes hold, that purchasing Greenland would also be absurd? It could cost in the trillions at a time when the federal budget is calamitous, higher interest rates and inflation have returned, and there are better things—really, anything else—to spend trillions of dollars on. There are real national security interests and economic interests involved in Greenland. The way to manage that is not to conquer the island but to reach an agreement with Denmark, which was our friend up until about 10 minutes ago.\n\nEverything was so nice and easy a year ago.\n\nThe Minnesota governor used to have a nice life. He put a solid 12 years into the House of Representatives then cruised to a comfy couple of terms as governor. Then, in 2024, he had to have the dotty idea to throw himself into contention for the vice presidency. Not good! It’s not just that he’ll forever be associated with a catastrophic presidential race for Democrats. It’s that the scrutiny returned home with him when he returned to Minnesota.\n\nWalz withdrew his bid for a third gubernatorial campaign this week amid various social services fraud scandals in the state that have drawn national media attention and a federal probe from the Trump administration. (Fortunately for Minnesota Democrats nervous about scandals engulfing the party in the midterms, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who always puts up strong margins in statewide races, may swoop into the governor’s race.) That decision hardly allows Walz to slink away from the spotlight, though, as now Minnesota is embroiled in an escalating standoff with the administration over ICE. His peace and quiet are another long year away.\n\nLindsey Graham and Rand Paul\n\nA new phase in a lasting Senate rivalry.\n\nAs the Surge wrote in a separate piece this week, the long-standing battle between interventionist Sen. Lindsey Graham and isolationist Sen. Rand Paul for Trump’s heart and mind took a dramatic turn in Graham’s favor when Trump sent the military into Venezuela to abduct its leader. Graham was waltzing around the Capitol with a grin on his face all week as if he had won the 250-year chess match of American politics once and for all. He even went out of his way to neener-neener Rand Paul, who was rather upset by the president’s interventionist turn, on social media.\n\nPaul did have one move up his sleeve, though. He, along with Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, forced a vote on a war powers resolution that would block the president from further military action in Venezuela barring congressional approval. The measure, somewhat surprisingly, advanced on a procedural vote on Thursday as five Republicans joined all Democrats in supporting it. This infuriated Trump, who said that those five Republicans “should never be elected to office again.” Graham, meanwhile, said that he would try to convene a meeting of the Senate GOP “regarding Democrats’ efforts to restrict President Trump’s authority as Commander in Chief under the War Powers Act” concerning “the constitutional effect of the War Powers Act and the damage it will do to our national security.” Graham has had just about enough of Congress, the Article I branch of government to which Graham belongs, having a say in foreign policy.\n\nAn in-kind donation to his presidential aspirations.\n\nLast year, Sen. Mark Kelly joined a handful of other Democrats in Congress in a video telling members of the military that they can refuse illegal orders. The administration took that personally. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth threatened Kelly’s retirement rank and pension for having the … the … the nerve to suggest that anyone could refuse to obey his illegal orders, calling it “seditious.” Earlier this week, then, Hegseth followed up and posted that the department had, in fact, “initiated retirement grade determination proceedings.” Most delightful, though, was his “letter of censure” to Kelly listing a bevy of offenses (various criticisms of the Trump administration) that disgraced the military. The censure letter, bless its heart, includes the line, “I hereby formally CENSURE you.” It’s a light and airy read.\n\nThe letter is more than a window into the Trump administration’s deep and dangerous insecurities. Mark Kelly was nearly selected to be Kamala Harris’ running mate in the 2024 election and, having dodged that bullet, must maintain some presidential ambitions. His flaw has always been that he’s a bit dry, though. So what better way to elevate his profile and spice up his credentials ahead of a Democratic presidential primary than a letter of censure (CENSURE) from the try-hard fitness instructor running the Pentagon?\n\nMaría Corina Machado\n\nDon’t forget to bring the medal to the White House.\n\nWith Nick Maduro sitting in the clink in Brooklyn, who’s going to run Venezuela? (Under the watchful eye of Secretary of State Marco Rubio, of course). The administration’s plan, at least for now, is to leave the existing Chavista regime in place under Maduro’s vice president, Delcy Rodríguez, so long as she does everything the United States wants. When Trump was asked early in the weak why he wouldn’t push to install the opposition leader, María Corina Machado, instead, he said that while “she’s a very nice woman,” she “doesn’t have the support within, or the respect within, the country.”\n\nThe administration’s overriding interest is in restructuring Venezuela as a colony, not making it a democracy, and the CIA determined that replacing the existing regime right now would be more trouble than it’s worth. But it didn’t break Trump’s heart to deny Machado control of the country. Machado won the Nobel Peace Prize last year after Trump had campaigned for it. The Washington Post, citing sources close to Trump, reported that this effectively killed her chances of running Venezuela after Maduro’s ouster. “If she had turned it down and said, ‘I can’t accept it because it’s Donald Trump’s,’ ” one source said, “she’d be the president of Venezuela today.” Trump and Machado are nevertheless expected to meet soon, and Machado has said she would be willing to present her prize to Trump to express her gratitude. Trump liked the sound of that and said it would be a “great honor” to accept it. The world could not be more odd right now.\n\nIt’s the Senate’s turn on ACA subsidies.\n\nOn Thursday, 17 House Republicans joined all Democrats to extend expired Affordable Care Act subsidies for another three years. This vote was made possible through use of a discharge petition, through which a majority of members can force a vote on a bill against House leadership’s wishes, and allows vulnerable Republican members to at least say that they tried. And while this particular bill is dead on arrival in the Senate, it does put pressure on Senate Republicans to address rising premiums in some way—or absorb the political blowback from failing to.\n\nSo what is Senate Majority Leader John Thune to do? The Senate has convened bipartisan working group trying to develop an extension that tightens subsidy eligibility. One of the stickiest points, as ever with ACA subsidies, is abortion. Republicans want more stringent Hyde Amendment protections in ACA plans to ensure that federal dollars would never even consider comingling with payments for abortion services. How does this get resolved? Perhaps with some browbeating from Trump. “You have to be a little flexible on Hyde, you know that,” Trump told House Republicans at a gathering this week. We’re not sure they know that at all.","summary":"Your own eyes tell you what happened in Minneapolis, but this administration can’t live with you believing your own eyes.","url":"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2026/01/ice-minneapolis-shooting-stephen-miller-venezuela.html?via=rss","image":"https://compote.slate.com/images/fcc49272-9b60-4b1f-8a45-076bffa4eac7.jpeg?crop=1560%2C1041%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-10 10:45:00","author":"Jim Newell","authors":["Jim Newell"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.221},{"id":392291124,"title":"Fraud is just the beginning of the Tim Walz failure","text":"What followed was one of the biggest spending explosions in Minnesota history. Annual general fund spending surged from $25 billion in 2022 to over $35 billion by 2024. The state has managed to balance spending and revenues for now, thanks to a one-time federal cash infusion, but it is looking at multibillion-dollar deficits every year in the future. Walz did not just spend more; he locked the state into permanently higher obligations without a sustainable revenue base to support them.\n\nYet for all that spending, Minnesotans saw little improvement where it mattered.\n\nTake education, for example. Minnesota ranked well above average in per-pupil spending before Walz’s trifecta. Then he and Democratic lawmakers shoveled billions of dollars more into K-12 education, universal school meals, and expanded administrative mandates. The results were dismal. Test scores continued to lag pre-pandemic levels, achievement gaps widened, and Minneapolis Public Schools continued to struggle despite repeated infusions of cash. More money did not buy better outcomes, just more bureaucracy and mandates, and less accountability.\n\nHealthcare followed the same pattern. Walz expanded public coverage, opened taxpayer-funded programs to illegal immigrants, and poured state dollars into health systems already struggling with cost inflation and workforce shortages. The result was not improved access or lower costs, but mounting fiscal stress. Hospitals across the state closed, services were cut, and there were staffing shortages. Faced with unsustainable spending, Walz was forced to cut back his illegal immigrant healthcare plan, limiting it to minors. Illegal immigrants over 18 years old no longer qualify for the program. Fraud proliferated in the public programs Walz touted as moral examples, exposing how little oversight accompanied the rapid expansion of government spending.\n\nEnergy policy may be the clearest example of ideological zeal overwhelming common sense. Walz signed laws mandating a carbon-free electricity grid, effectively banning fossil fuels by 2040, even as Minnesota, currently under a blanket of snow, remains heavily dependent on them for reliable power. Predictably, energy prices rose. Utility companies warned of higher rates, grid instability, and long-term affordability problems, warnings the Walz administration brushed aside. Energy became more expensive just as inflation was squeezing household budgets.\n\nRising costs were compounded by higher taxes. Minnesota already had one of the highest tax burdens in the country. Under Walz, lawmakers raised taxes again, expanded payroll levies, and created new fees to fund progressive priorities. Businesses noticed, and so did the public. Minnesota lost population to lower-tax, lower-cost states. Employers expanded elsewhere. Young families followed opportunity out the door.\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris chose Walz as her running mate, not because he was moderate — he was not — but because his status as an old white man was meant to give a veneer of moderation to the Democratic Party’s far-left agenda. That agenda of massive spending increases failed to deliver better schools, better healthcare, or a more affordable cost of living. Instead, Minnesotans were left with higher taxes, higher energy bills, worsening fiscal outlooks, and a growing sense that their state government and state governor had lost touch with reality.\n\nFraud scandals finally ended Walz’s career, but the more serious damage was already done by the failure of his progressive agenda long before the headlines broke.","summary":"Gov.&#160;Tim Walz&#160;(D-MN) ended his political career on Monday, announcing that he would abandon his reelection campaign in light of the&#160;fraud scandals&#160;involving his state’s nutrition,&#160;healthcare, and&#160;child care&#160;programs.

The statement counts off 57 times the Democrats made “sick, unhinged“ comments and criticized lawmakers for their rhetoric. Newsweek reached out to the White House for comment via email on Friday evening. Why It Matters The statement follows two shootings involving ICE agents this week: The first, on Wednesday in Minneapolis, was deadly, ending the life of Renee Nicole Good and drawing national scrutiny as well as condemnation from Democrats. The second, on Thursday in Portland, Oregon, wounded two people later alleged by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) as associates of the Tren de Aragua gang. Good's death has stirred up division along party lines, with the White House and Republicans defending ICE agent Jonathan Ross while Democrats have criticized the agency and call for his prosecution. Both sides remained deeply entrenched in their stances, even after video footage from the perspective of the ICE agent was released to news media. Vice President JD Vance took an especially strong stance on the death and reporting around it, calling those who accused Ross of murder “radicals,“ while saying that Good's death was “a tragedy of her own making.“ President Donald Trump previously called for an end to divisive rhetoric in the wake of Charlie Kirk's assassination. Concerned citizens gather in front of the Minnesota State Capitol in Saint Paul during a demonstration Friday over the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent. (Photo by Charly Triballeau/AFP via Getty Images) What To Know The statement, posted on the White House website, is titled “57 Times Sick, Unhinged Democrats Declared War on Law Enforcement“ and lists each instance, with links to social media posts or interviews with media and names the person who made each comment. The White House praised ICE and its mission to “valiantly“ defend “our sovereignty and communities,“ linking the post to National Law Enforcement Appreciation Day. The list labels the comments as “smears,“ variously saying the Democrats “accused“ and “attacked“ ICE agents with their words, adding, “unhinged Radical Left Democrats have escalated their torrent of vicious, inflammatory attacks on these very heroes — branding them as Nazis, terrorists, and Gestapo thugs while inciting their delusional supporters to unleash violence.“ The list includes comments from U.S. Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortes of New York; Rashida Tlaib of Michigan; Summer Lee of Pennsylvania; and Joaquin Castro of Texas, as well as Mayors Brandon Johnson of Chicago; Zohran Mamdani of New York City; Michelle Wu of Boston; and Karen Bass of Los Angeles. Most notable, the list is topped with comments from Minnesota Governor Tim Walz—a recent and frequent target of ire for Republicans and the Trump administration—and California Governor Gavin Newsom, who leads in polling for the Democratic presidential nominee in 2028, often in close contention with former Vice President Kamala Harris. The White House ended its post with a picture of the phrase, “I STAND WITH ICE,“ echoing a refrain shared on Thursday by the White House on social media. What People Are Saying Conservative radio show host and author Howie Carr, on X: “Check this out from the White House. Do these statements constitute an “insurrection?“ Did any of the comrades mention protesting “peacefully and patriotically?“ Trump, on Truth Social: “The woman driving the car was very disorderly, obstructing and resisting, who then violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer, who seems to have shot her in self-defense. Based on the attached clip, it is hard to believe he is alive, but is now recovering in the hospital. The situation is being studied, in its entirety, but the reason these incidents are happening is because the Radical Left is threatening, assaulting, and targeting our Law Enforcement Officers and ICE Agents on a daily basis. They are just trying to do the job of MAKING AMERICA SAFE. We need to stand by and protect our Law Enforcement Officers from this Radical Left Movement of Violence and Hate!“ U.S. Representative Hank Johnson, a Georgia Democrat, on X: “Speaking of law enforcement, why weren't you at the anniversary vigil Tuesday honoring the heroism of Capitol Police during the January 6th insurrection, and fallen patriot Brian Sicknick, who was killed protecting our democracy? And yes, your federal henchman was wrong for murdering a mother who was turning away from him, going 3 mph.“","summary":"President Donald Trump previously blamed divisive rhetoric for playing a significant role in Charlie Kirk&#039;s assassination.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/law-enforcement-appreciation-ice-shooting-trump-white-house-11339248","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2254867345.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-10 02:32:27","author":"Peter Aitken","authors":["Peter Aitken"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.147},{"id":392174760,"title":"Judge blocks Trump from freezing $10 billion in child, family aid to five US states","text":"APUS President Donald Trump \n\nA U.S. judge on Friday temporarily blocked ⁠President Donald Trump's administration from freezing access by five Democratic-led states to more than $10 billion of federal funds for childcare and family assistance based on what it said were concerns about fraud.

The lawsuit was filed Thursday by Illinois and the four other states.\n\nThe Trump administration announced earlier this week that Illinois, Minnesota, New York, California and Colorado would be cut off from $7 billion in funding for the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, which provides cash assistance for households with children, nearly $2.4 billion for the Child Care and Development Fund, which helps support working parents with child care and around $870 million for social services grants that help children at risk.\n\nIt came a week after the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said it was freezing child care funds in Minnesota and asking for an audit of day care centers amid allegations of fraud by day care centers run by Somali residents.\n\n“I’m pleased with the court’s decision, which protects critical funding to support families and help working parents access child care,” Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul said in a statement. “There is no justification for this attempted funding freeze. It is a cruel and illegal attempt by the Trump administration to play politics with the lives of children and low-income families. I remain committed to protecting Illinois residents from bearing the brunt of this president’s continued disregard for our Constitution and the rule of law.”\n\nA spokesperson for HHS didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIllinois was set to cut off from $1 billion in funding across the three programs, according to the state’s Department of Human Services, which administers the funds. That would have amounted to around 150,000 children being impacted by the funding freeze.\n\nA spokesperson for IDHS said the agency does not anticipate an immediate impact to funding as a result of the judge’s order.\n\nWhen announcing the freeze, HHS Assistant Secretary Alex Adams said the federal government is concerned by potential “systemic fraud in Illinois Child Care and Development Fund services.” He claimed the Trump administration “has reason to believe” the state is “illicitly providing” CCDF benefits to people without legal status in the U.S.\n\nIn their lawsuit, Raoul and the other attorneys general called the fraud allegations, “pretextual, vague, and unsubstantiated.”\n\nAt a news conference earlier Friday, before the judge’s ruling, U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin blasted the Trump administration’s decision to freeze the funds, warning that children in the targeted states will “pay the price.”\n\nDurbin claimed that the funds, which helps families afford child care, were slashed because Trump received fewer votes in Illinois than former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.\n\n“We should not penalize these children for political reasons,” said Durbin at Concordia Place in Avondale, a child care provider that relies on federal funds to operate. Representatives for the Illinois Action for Children joined Durbin at the event.","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/2026/01/09/judge-temporarily-blocks-trump-administration-from-freezing-child-care-funding-in-illinois-4-other-states","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6f16335/2147483647/strip/false/crop/6122x4083+0+0/resize/1486x991!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff9%2F10%2F5ac87870cbd4e4ff97e8dc683a65%2Fmerli","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-10 00:21:51","author":"Elleiana Green,Kade Heather","authors":["Elleiana Green","Kade Heather"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.317},{"id":392171796,"title":"Judge blocks Trump from freezing $10 billion in child, family aid to five US states","text":"NEW YORK, Jan 9 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Friday temporarily blocked President Donald Trump's administration from freezing access by five Democratic-led states to more than $10 billion of federal funds for childcare and family assistance based on what it said were concerns about fraud.

Trump Talk WH Meet-up on Venezuela, 'Long-Term' Effect on Prices","text":"On Friday, President Trump hosted representatives of some of the world's largest oil companies at the White House. The president's only complaint seemed to be that the new ballroom wasn't yet complete, because, as he claimed, they could have filled it.\n\nPresident Trump announced the meeting on Truth Social.\n\nThe president wrote:\n\nThe largest Oil Companies in the World are coming to the White House at 2:30 P.M. Everybody wants to be there. It’s too bad that the Ballroom hasn’t completed because, if it were, it would be PACKED. We apologize to those Oil Companies that we cannot take today, but Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, and Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum, will see them over the next week. Everyone is in daily contact. Today’s meeting will almost exclusively be a discussion on Venezuelan Oil, and our longterm relationship with Venezuela, its Security, and People. A very big factor in this involvement will be the reduction of Oil Prices for the American People. Additionally, and perhaps most importantly of all, will be the stoppage of Drugs and Criminals coming into the United States of America. Thank you for your attention to this matter!\n\nA reduction in oil prices would be good - up to a point, of course; if prices drop too far, it can make production in some areas not economically viable. That is, though, often a problem that fixes itself in time. \n\nRead More: Pre-Dawn Blitz: Navy, Marines Seize Another Tramp Oil Hauler\n\nIt's the response from the US Oil & Gas Association, though, that's really interesting.\n\nIt's a long post, but here are a few highlights.\n\nHere is our afternoon take on this WH meeting. There are 2 \"Must haves\" for producers to go back into Venezuela. 1 - We need know our crews are not going to get kidnapped. 2- We need to know investment and capital expenditures are going to be safe from seizure by a foreign government. The overwhelming show of force from the US military on last Saturday morning – well, that solves the first problem. \n\nIndeed, it does - as long as President Trump is in office. Anything past that depends on who wins the presidential election in 2028; if, in January, 2029, sees, say, a President JD Vance and Vice President Marco Rubio inaugurated (just to name a couple of possibilities) then that assurance will last. If a Democrat should win... Well, if that happened, were I an oil company executive, I'd probably be giving some serious thought to divesting of any assets in Venezuela, and getting my people out.\n\nRE: #2 -- I expect that the Administration will put a very interesting set of financing options on the table for US producers that will link Venezuelan investment not to a company’s CapEx budgets – but to the US government’s international project financing mechanisms such as the ExIm bank or other entities designed to reduce exposure to US interests and investments overseas. Its’s one thing to have a foreign government seize a company’s asset – but seizing an asset that is financed and back by the US government? Try it and you gonna get another visit in the middle of the night by representatives of the US military.\n\nThe same thing as above applies. Not only the midterms but the 2028 elections. We have to keep control, or all this comes flying apart. We have to win these elections, or all this is for naught. Republicans, strangely, have a bad habit of underperforming on midterms; that has to stop. We have to turn out, we have to win, or all this stops. It sounds tiresome, sometimes, to keep proclaiming every upcoming election as \"OMG most important election ever,\" but we are at a critical juncture.

The first one was a graphic calling ICE a “federally funded and supported terrorist group,” with the original creator describing the agency’s actions as “tearing apart families, terrorizing citizens, and now murdering innocent people.”\n\nBillie Eilish Pushes for Gun Control Amid ‘Devastating’ Shootings in U.S. & Australia: ‘Raise Your Voice’\n\nJohn Mulaney Postpones Minneapolis Shows Following ICE Killing of Renee Nicole Good: ‘What’s Happening in Your City Is Heartbreaking’\n\nBillie Eilish Condemns Israel Defense Minister’s Plan to Forcibly Relocate Palestinians: ‘Horrifying’\n\nThe second post Eilish reshared on her Story calls on the country to “abolish ICE,” listing 32 people who reportedly died in ICE custody last year. The third encourages U.S. citizens to call their representatives in Congress to demand that ICE be defunded, and for the officer who fired the deadly shot in Minneapolis to be arrested and charged immediately.\n\nBillboard has reached out to the White House and the Department of Homeland Security for comment.\n\nICE’s actions under the Donald Trump administration have been polarizing since he took office a year ago, but backlash has reached an all-time high this week following the scene in Minneapolis. The DHS, the president and Vice President JD Vance have all claimed that Good was trying to run over the agents with her car leading up to the shooting, and that the officer in question was acting in self defense; however, widely circulated video footage of the incident shows that Good had actually been driving the opposite way.\n\nEven Trump struggled to explain what happened after he personally watched the video of the shooting in the Oval Office with a New York Times reporter also in the room. “Well … I … the way I look at it … it’s a terrible scene,” the newspaper reports of the twice-impeached POTUS’ reaction to the footage. “I think it’s horrible to watch. No, I hate to see it.”\n\nEilish has long been vocal in her opposition to Trump’s policies, endorsing his opponent, Kamala Harris, in the 2024 election.

Substantively, however, it was familiar: a message rooted in the importance of place.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with the Washington Examiner after the speech, before departing for his Philadelphia announcement, Shapiro summed it up simply: different location, same goal — ensuring every community in Pennsylvania gets a fair shot.\n\n“I wanted to be focused here in the union hall on those who I believe are going to make up the power of the next generation of workers in Pennsylvania,” he said of the trade union members who are already working on shovel-ready energy projects in the region.\n\n“If we don’t invest in skills-based labor, we’re not going to have as bright a future in our commonwealth,” he said. “And so that’s why I’m here today, focused on what I think is the ability to help every Pennsylvanian chart their own course and achieve success. And so much of that runs through halls like this one.”\n\nBefore Shapiro took to the stage, one of the people who stepped up ahead of him was a man who goes by “Tim O”, a 52-year-old father who is on his second career and his second year in a carpentry apprenticeship. Tim became choked up when he said, “I don’t look like other apprentices.”\n\nShapiro said Tim was an example of his administration’s investment in trade programs in a state where over 60% of the population did not attend college and that it was important to give him a platform.\n\n“One of the things I always ask the apprentices is, ‘Hey, how’d you get here? What brought you here? What was your journey?’ Some of them come right out of high school, and we want to create those pathways,” Shapiro explained of the variety of answers he has received over the years. “Some of them go to college for a year, realize it’s not for them. Some of them have different careers and then find their ways here.”\n\n“The key is opening up the doors to places like this and showing people it exists because we need people like Tim O., who, even at 52 to dedicate their lives to having the skills we need to produce more energy, to quite literally build bridges and build buildings,” Shapiro said.\n\nThe speech was filled with stories highlighting accomplishments, future goals, and governing with purpose, and included a brief swipe at the bipartisan chaos in Washington. Notably, Shapiro avoided inflammatory language, steering clear of demonizing Republicans or President Donald Trump.\n\nAnd he uses the word “we” instead of “I” when discussing accomplishments, something many politicians cannot find a way to do.\n\n“I obviously have profound differences from the president. You have written about that,” he said. “No one expects us to agree on everything. But to me, vilifying others, attacking others, is not a way to bring people together and get stuff done.”\n\nShapiro, who has a good relationship with Sen. Dave McCormick (R-PA), said his job is to champion the things people can do together for the commonwealth.\n\n“My focus is on building bridges, creating more opportunity for folks to come together, and delivering results for people like Tim O. and others who need help,” he said. “And so, to me, I want this campaign to be hopeful. I want to highlight differences where we have different policy views, but I want to focus on uplifting people.”\n\nLarry Ceisler, a Washington County native and Philadelphia-based public affairs official, said the reason you do not see Shapiro go personal on Trump is that, first of all, that is always who he has been and, second, because he always wants his governance to be about purpose, not divisiveness.\n\n“He always tries to make it substantive and not personal because he never wants to be perceived as attacking the people who support the president, so when he does criticize, it is based on the issues,” Ceisler said.\n\nShapiro begins his launch with a formidable amount of cash. This week, his campaign announced he ended 2025 with over $30 million in cash on hand and a Quinnipiac University poll that showed Shapiro’s favorability rating at 58%.\n\nHe faces Republican Stacy Garrity, the state treasurer, who has won back-to-back races for that statewide elected office. Garrity said in a statement that “Josh Shapiro is more concerned with a promotion to Pennsylvania Avenue than serving hardworking Pennsylvanians.”\n\nShapiro’s governorship entered the national spotlight early, shaped by crisis decisions beginning in 2023, shortly after he took office, with the train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, near the Pennsylvania border. The fiery wreck, visible for miles, was followed by a controlled burn that raised concerns across Beaver and Lawrence counties over toxic contamination in the air and water.\n\nThat was followed in June 2023 by a tanker truck crash beneath Interstate 95 in Philadelphia, a vital East Coast artery carrying more than 150,000 vehicles a day. The crash killed the driver and caused the overpass to collapse. Despite predictions that the highway could be closed for years, six temporary lanes reopened within two weeks, allowing traffic to move while permanent repairs were made.\n\nShapiro was also governor in July 2024 when gunman Thomas Crooks attempted to assassinate Trump, killing local fire chief Cory Comperatore and wounding two others. Shapiro was on the scene in Butler the following morning with first responders and investigators. He was in office as well when Luigi Mangione was arrested in Altoona for the alleged killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, and when three police officers were murdered in York County in the deadliest day for Pennsylvania law enforcement in 16 years.\n\nDuring that period, Shapiro was also on the short list of possible running mates for 2024 Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, before ultimately determining the role was not the right fit.\n\nLast year, an arsonist attempted to kill Shapiro and his family by firebombing the governor’s residence, setting the home ablaze, and causing extensive damage. Shapiro, his wife, their children, and other family members narrowly escaped the rapidly spreading flames.\n\nShapiro has said the attack prompted serious conversations with his wife about whether he should seek reelection.\n\n“I think a couple of days after that, my primary focus was on being a good dad and a good husband and being a good governor. And I have tried very, very hard to both heal myself and be there for my kids as they work through this and be there for Laurie,” he said of his wife, who was with him at the beginning of the interview.\n\nShapiro admits there were many family discussions on what they should do.\n\n“We had a long talk about whether we wanted to keep doing this in the face of that kind of attack and that kind of threat,” he said. “The reality is we all ended up in the exact same place. Yes, we not only have to keep governing, but we’ve got to run again and keep doing this because you can’t let those who want to inflict pain on others bring harm to communities. You can’t let them win.”\n\nShapiro said he expects to continue working through the aftermath for years, noting that members of both parties privately reached out to check on his well-being and offer help, including Trump, who was himself the target of an assassination attempt.\n\n“He called, and I appreciated that,” he said. “And we talked about his brush with death in public. No public officials should have to go through this. Our politics shouldn’t be this way.”\n\nShapiro said he hopes the way he runs his campaign and governs will help lower the temperature and allow for a measure of healing.\n\n“I said today in my speech, go talk to that person that voted a different way in the last election and have a respectful conversation,” Shapiro said. “We need more of that.”","summary":"COLLIER TOWNSHIP, Pennsylvania — Gov.

A federal immigration officer fatally shot Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old mother and U.S. citizen, on Wednesday, unleashing a national furor, pitting federal and local officials against each other and drawing thousands of people to the streets in protest. Wednesday’s deadly confrontation was the culmination of weeks of intensified scrutiny, verbal attacks and even conspiracy theories directed at Minnesota and Gov. Tim Walz by President Donald Trump, his administration and his allies. Exactly why the president has been so fixated on Minnesota isn’t totally clear, though local officials and strategists working in state and national politics have pointed NBC News to Trump’s long-running — and unsuccessful — attempts to win the state and his personal disdain for Walz. Many said it’s a case of Trump going after deep-blue cities in part due to their immigration policies. A central focus of the administration’s attacks on Minnesota has also been the Justice Department’s yearslong fraud investigation that has involved some members of Minnesota’s Somali community. In 2022, during President Joe Biden’s administration, federal prosecutors announced initial indictments in what they called a $250 million scheme to defraud a federal child nutrition program. They described Aimee Bock, who is white, as the mastermind of the operation. A jury convicted her in March. So far, prosecutors have charged 92 people and dozens have been convicted. But conservative influencers have latched onto the scandal to push unsubstantiated claims, and Trump has used it to make disparaging remarks about people of Somali descent. For Minnesotans, the result of all this attention has largely been disgust, fury and exhaustion. “They’re trying to break us,” said Democratic state Rep. Emma Greenman, whose district is roughly a mile from where the shooting occurred. She said she believes the administration targeted the state because it is “a successful story of multiracial democracy and immigration — and it inherently represents a threat to authoritarian power.” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told NBC News that Trump “loves Minnesota and the people.” “It’s a state where he received historic Republican support, and he has long called out Walz for his incompetence and terrible leadership.” “I wish they would just leave us the f--- alone,” Democratic Sen. Tina Smith of Minnesota told NBC News on Wednesday. Asked why Trump was so fixated on the state, Smith replied, “I wish I knew.” 'He's never gotten Walz' Trump has called Walz “corrupt,” “whacked out” and “grossly incompetent.” On Saturday, the president shared a video on social media that promoted a conspiracy theory about a Democratic lawmaker in the state who, along with her husband, was assassinated in June. The video falsely implied that Walz had something to do with the killing. Trump has also repeatedly made derogatory comments in recent weeks about Somali immigrants in Minnesota, calling them “scammers” and “lowlifes.” While the fraud investigation into the use of federal social services funds in Minnesota has received bipartisan support in the past, Somali Americans who run child care facilities, which have been the subject of fresh allegations in the scandal, in the state say they’ve been harassed and threatened since a conservative influencer’s lengthy video on the issue went viral. Many Democrats in the state have acknowledged that its party leaders have mishandled the situation politically as well. A state audit report released in 2024 found that failures by the state’s Education Department led to the misuse of the Covid-era program. On Monday, Walz made the surprise announcement that he would no longer be running for re-election amid the scrutiny and pressure. A former senior White House official who, like others in this article, was granted anonymity to speak candidly, said Trump has long been mystified by why then-Vice President Kamala Harris chose Walz as her running mate in 2024. “He’s never gotten Walz. Never gotten it,” the official said, saying Trump and his team believed someone like Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro would have been a stronger choice. For some in Minnesota, what made Good’s shooting especially tragic was that they saw something like it coming. Bringing in federal agents, against the wishes of the state’s political leaders — and many of its residents — was a bomb waiting to go off, Frey and Walz said Wednesday. “What we’re seeing is the consequences of governance designed to generate fear, headlines and conflict. It’s governing by reality TV, and today that recklessness cost someone their life,” Walz said in a news conference. “Now we hear more political rhetoric. Enough. Enough is enough.” Frey called the incident “totally predictable” and “totally avoidable” and told Immigration and Customs Enforcement to “get the f--- out” of Minneapolis. On Fox News on Wednesday night, Vice President JD Vance declared that Walz should resign. He also made an admission. “Look, I’ve beaten up on Tim Walz enough. I don’t want to do it anymore on your program,” Vance said. “I almost feel bad for the guy, except for the fact that he should have seen this,” he said, referring to the fraud allegations. On Thursday, however, Vance joined Leavitt at the press briefing, where he again went after Walz. “Tim Walz is a joke,” he said. “His entire administration has been a joke, the idea that he’s some sort of freedom fighter. He’s not. He’s a guy who has enabled fraud, and maybe, in fact, has participated in fraud.” There is no evidence that Walz participated in alleged fraud. Leavitt also said the administration wouldn’t be taking its eye off Minnesota. “The Department of Homeland Security will continue to operate on the ground in Minnesota, not only to remove criminal illegal aliens, but also to continue conducting door-to-door investigations of the rampant fraud that has taken place in the state under the failed and corrupt leadership of Democrat Gov. Tim Walz,” she announced. Tensions, years in the making Trump’s focus on Minnesota can be traced to 2016, when he first toppled the so-called blue wall and won Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania — and saw Minnesota as potentially within reach. Republicans have not won Minnesota in a presidential election since 1972. In the view of one Democratic strategist who has worked in Minnesota, “the Trump folks thought if they squeezed Minnesota, they could turn it red.” Preya Samsundar, a Minnesota-based Republican strategist, noted Trump’s long-held goal of turning the state red and described the president’s attention and effort as a “poke in the eye” to Walz. “I think for a lot of folks, Minnesota is still one of those states that can be attainable with the right effort,” said Samsundar, a former Midwest regional communications director for the Republican National Committee. “I think now a part of the White House’s focus is because Tim Walz was a VP candidate from a state that Trump has wanted to flip for some while.” Until abandoning his campaign for a third term, Walz had been positioning himself as one of the Democratic Party’s future leaders, “making him a convenient person to go after,” Samsundar added. Indeed, Trump’s criticism of Walz intensified after Harris chose him as her running mate. Trump frequently assailed Walz as a “dangerously liberal extremist.” Walz, for his part, emerged as the Democratic ticket’s chief attack dog against Trump, further attracting his ire. After Trump won, he and his allies lumped Minnesota in with other Democratic states that, he said, weren’t aggressive enough on immigration. Minnesota is home to the nation’s largest Somali population, and most of them are U.S. citizens. Since 1993, thousands of people have fled war and instability in the East African country. As Trump has ramped up ICE actions across the U.S., the community, mostly based in the Twin Cities, has been the target of the agency’s efforts in Minnesota. And Walz hasn’t held his tongue regarding ICE, slamming it last year as Trump’s “modern-day Gestapo.” On Wednesday, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, a longtime Walz ally, called the governor to remind him to keep in mind what he was dealing with: a Trump administration that lies, according to a person with knowledge of the conversation. Pritzker also reupped a playbook he had shared in the past with Walz and other Democratic governors, which was to repeatedly remind his state’s residents that it was their right to protest the government but not to “take the bait” and descend into violence. That was, Pritzker believed, exactly what the Trump administration wanted so it could declare martial law. Later Wednesday, Walz conveyed that to his residents, imploring them not to “take the bait.” “They want a show,” Walz said at his news conference. “We can’t give it to them.” Unfolding fraud allegations Meanwhile, a broad fraud scandal has been unfolding in the state involving the alleged misuse of hundreds of millions of dollars in federal welfare funds. The allegations pertain largely to the Somali community. Trump has repeatedly said the Somali community has “destroyed Minnesota“ and “our country,” and his Justice Department is sending additional federal prosecutors to the state to assist the U.S. attorney’s office there with the ongoing investigations into the matter. Republicans in the state and at the national level have blamed Walz for not taking the allegations seriously. “The fraud is a powerful issue because it’s a real-life example of what the majority of Republicans and independents already feel is true — that their tax dollars are wasted by politicians and people taking advantage of the system,” said Matt Wolking, a longtime GOP strategist who was on Trump’s 2020 campaign. A state Democratic lawmaker, however, said the Republican attacks all feel “very personal.” “Donald Trump has vendettas — he goes after people. Clearly that’s a piece of this,” the person said. “The city is emotionally fatigued,” added Roy Temple, a national Democratic operative with decades of experience in Minnesota politics, who said that, even six years later, the city is “still healing” from the George Floyd murder and fallout. “People’s nerves are pretty shot,” Temple said, adding that the ICE raids and the fatal shooting are “triggering.” Complicating part of the picture, however, is the scope and potential severity of the allegations of fraud. Other Democrats in the state agreed with the sentiment that Trump was unfairly attacking many elements of Walz’s record and dumping on the Somali community — while also acknowledging the possibility that Walz hasn’t handled the situation well. “This has been in the air in Minnesota for some time; it’s one of those things that we knew at some point this issue would really kind of percolate to the top. And we’re seeing that happen now, where a spotlight is put on this — for multiple reasons,” a Minneapolis-based Democratic operative said. The operative added that Walz’s “biggest problem” with the fraud allegations was that “he just didn’t really have any good answers for any of this.” At a separate hearing in Congress this week on the Minnesota fraud issue, Democrats fumed about the hypocrisy of Trump administration officials who, while complaining about fraud and ICE protests in Democratic areas, pardoned fraudsters aligned with the president as well as those convicted of violence against federal officers on Jan. 6, 2021. Republicans in the state largely defended Trump’s message — though not necessarily his tone — expressing solidarity with efforts to unroot fraud and tackle immigration enforcement. “The national attention that the president has brought to Minnesota means that people are listening now,” state GOP Chair Alex Plechash said.","summary":"President Donald Trump and his allies have for weeks intensified scrutiny on Minnesota and its governor, Democrat Tim Walz.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trumps-focus-minnesota-ice-shooting-rcna252826","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/260107-tim-walz-vl-1220p-8bc968.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-09 19:26:10","author":"Adam Edelman,Natasha Korecki","authors":["Adam Edelman","Natasha Korecki"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"na","sentiment":-0.523},{"id":392147036,"title":"Jesse Ventura calls Trump 'coward,' says he's 'owed' another governor term","text":"In the wake of a deadly shooting by an immigration agent in his home state, former Minnesota Gov.

Drug trafficking through US-Mexico border The US and Mexico share a border of around 3,145 kilometres, stretching from the Pacific Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico. Successive US governments have long accused their counterparts in Mexico of failing to crack down on the cartels smuggling drugs across the border.

US sanctions Mexican cartels In February 2025, the US State Department had designated several major Mexican criminal organizations, including Sinaloa Cartel, Cártel de Jalisco Nueva Generación, Cártel del Noreste, La Nueva Familia Michoacana, Cártel del Golfo and Carteles Unidos as Foreign Terrorist Organizations and Specially Designated Global Terrorists. also read After Venezuela, alarm bells in Mexico, Colombia, Cuba: What’s behind Trump’s latest threats?

But, as she noted immediately after a public ceremonial swearing-in as Detroit's next leader, she is the first woman to helm a city founded in 1701.\n\nFrom the city's poet laureate to the federal judge who offered the oath of office to Sheffield, the monumental nature of a Black woman becoming Detroit's mayor remained front and center.\n\n\"I am deeply grateful to be the first woman to lead this city in its 324-year history,\" Sheffield said while on stage Friday, Jan. 9, at the Detroit Opera House, thanking \"courageous\" women that came before her for their work that helped her achieve the office.\n\nSheffield, new Detroit City Council President James Tate and the city's other elected officials celebrated their new roles, waving to crowds of enthusiastic guests at the Opera House. Sheffield officially became mayor at the start of the new year.\n\nShe thanked her family and other city leaders for their help and support. She thanked former Mayor Mike Duggan for his work steering the city, words that garnered substantial applause and a standing ovation. And she thanked business leaders, noting they are aligned with city government.\n\nBut she spent the most time thanking Detroiters.\n\n\"To the people of Detroit, the soul and heartbeat of this city. Today, we begin a new chapter,\" she said.\n\n\"I embrace the responsibility of this historic moment. But this moment does not belong to one person: it belongs to every neighborhood in this city.\"\n\nSheffield said she had a long-standing belief in public service, instilled by the teachings and lives of her parents. She said in the city's next chapter, Sheffield and other leaders will draw on these historic teachings to guide them for the future.\n\n\"The question before us is clear: Where do we go from here Detroit? In this next chapter, we must commit ourselves to the work of building a beloved community, one that is rooted in dignity, justice and opportunity for every Detroiter,\" Sheffield said.\n\n\"In this administration, every voice will guide our path, including voices that far too often have been overlooked. We will work every single day to build a Detroit that works for everyone.\"\n\nShe pledged to make Detroit a city where families want to stay and where ambition is embraced.\n\n\"Let's rise higher together,\" she said, wrapping up her roughly 15-minute speech.\n\nTate, the new city council president and longtime member, said he was honored and grateful to take on the new leadership role. He noted Sheffield's growth as a member of the same city council, adding he feels exceptional to see \"one of our own\" ascend to the mayor's office.\n\n\"We will support Mayor Sheffield, and we will also push her when it is needed to ensure our residents are getting the results they deserve,\" Tate said shortly before Sheffield spoke.\n\n\"As we begin this new term, I am confident ... Detroit's best days are still ahead of us.\"\n\nThe group takes control of Michigan's largest city at a pivotal point: There's a $105 million surplus and more than $500 million in reserves, homicides hit their lowest levels in decades last year and expectations for ongoing growth remain high.\n\nBut obvious challenges are on the horizon. Many of Detroit's 200 neighborhoods want to share in the economic development growth enjoyed downtown. The potential for federal funding cuts remains present yet unpredictable. And there is the persistent problem of long-term population growth for a city that has watched hundreds of thousands of residents leave in recent decades.\n\nIn a scrum with reporters after the event, Sheffield reiterated that her administration will focus on improving the quality of life for all residents, whether that includes investments in neighborhoods, improving the educational system, building additional housing, driving down crime or increasing incomes for Detroiters.\n\n“We hear that neighborhoods are oftentimes left out, have not been invested in. Sometimes, the individuals who may not have the resources to participate in government — which in my entire time on council, I’ve always prided myself on going to meet people where they are. So, we want to ensure that this is a government that listens to all, that we’re inclusive as possible,” Sheffield said.\n\nSheffield added that she will transition and expand her signature Occupy the Corner initiative — an initiative to bring resources to neighborhoods — that she started while on the city council, to Occupy the City to create safe spaces and empower Detroit’s youths.\n\n“Youth will be a central focus of this administration,” Sheffield said.\n\nThe investiture kicked off a few minutes after 10 a.m., honoring Sheffield, City Council members, the city clerk and board of police commissioners. The sold-out event — holding a capacity of 2,700 — serves as a historic moment for the city's top office, as voters elected the first-ever woman to lead Detroit.\n\nLocal musicians sang, welcoming attendees, while leaders from several faiths prayed for a prosperous, peaceful Detroit and successful tenure for Sheffield.\n\nCity Council members, the city clerk and members of the police board of commissioners raised their right hands and swore to faithfully fulfill their elected roles.\n\njessica Care moore, the city's poet laureate, offered an impassioned original piece celebrating Sheffield and her new space leading Detroit.\n\n\"The beauty is in the resume, legacy in her DNA,\" moore said of Sheffield, noting it took more than 300 years for the city to elect a woman to serve as mayor.\n\n\"She has actually been walking the actual walk, and when she runs, she actually runs. ... Mayor Sheffield knows exactly who she is, and so does the D.\"\n\nJennine Spencer-Gilbert, 55, president of the Field Street Block Club, showed up two weeks after having knee surgery to ring in the new mayor and elected officials and celebrate what she calls “a very historic moment” for Detroit.\n\n“She’s the first Black woman to be mayor. It shows our young men and women what you can accomplish at any age. It's historic because it means so much to our communities, to our Black women, Black boys and girls, and all cultures. You can be anything that you want to be. I’m so proud and overwhelmed, and excited about this today. It’s a big win for, not just our city, but for our nation, and also our ancestors,” Spencer-Gilbert said. “That allows us and other children of all races to know it doesn’t matter what race you are … you can win, you just have to believe and push hard.”\n\nSpencer-Gilbert added that Sheffield has visited her neighborhood and others to help leverage grants for various quality of life issues, describing Sheffield as a “reliable and dependable” leader.\n\nMonique Smith, 54, attended to watch Sheffield be publicly sworn in, noting that her representation makes her “feel like nothing is out of reach.”\n\n“If you have a passion for something, keep fighting for it. Because she could’ve easily just gave up and said, ‘I know they’re not gonna vote for a woman, look what Kamala (Harris) went through. They didn’t vote for her.’ But she just kept going because she knew she had a vision for what she wanted Detroit to be,” Smith said.\n\nDuggan and his wife attended the event, as did other prominent current or former elected leaders. That includes former U.S. Sen. Debbie Stabenow, state senator and current U.S. Senate candidate Mallory McMorrow, gubernatorial candidate and current Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist and Macomb County Executive Mark Hackel.\n\nSheffield takes the top job after Duggan opted to run for governor instead of pursuing another term, 12 years after becoming mayor. Raised by a civil rights activist and an educator, Sheffield served 12 years on City Council, four as the council president.\n\nShe handily dispatched a bevy of challengers en route to the mayor's office. In the August primary she garnered 51% of the vote, 34 percentage points more than Triumph Church Pastor Solomon Kinloch Jr. In November, she cruised to a win, receiving roughly 77% of votes to 23% for Kinloch — \"that's not bad,\" Sheffield said, noting the percent of the vote she received. That's a larger margin of victory than any enjoyed by Duggan during his runs for mayor.\n\nDetroit's officeholders officially began their roles on Jan. 1 and were required to legally take an oath of office per the city charter. Sheffield was surrounded by family and a few close colleagues during her official swearing-in with City Clerk Janice Winfrey.\n\nDetroit's returning and new council members include: Tate, President Pro-Tem Coleman Young II, At-Large Councilmember Mary Waters, District 2 Member Angela Whitfield-Calloway, District 3 Member Scott Benson, District 4 Member Latisha Johnson, District 5 Member Renata Miller, District 6 Member Gabriela Santiago-Romero, District 7 Member Denzel McCampbell. Miller and McCampbell are the newest members on council.\n\nCity Council members on Monday, Jan. 5 appointed Tate and Young as leaders of the nine-member body.\n\nSheffield is hosting an inaugural ball at 7 p.m. at The Icon. The event is open to the public by purchasing tickets for $100 each. Proceeds will benefit the Homeless Action Network of Detroit, according to the invitation. The strolling event will feature small bites from Andiamo, live entertainment and brief remarks from the mayor.\n\nDana Afana is the Detroit City Hall reporter for the Free Press.

Gavin Newsom’s biggest strength – political spin and performance come almost second nature to him – could also be his biggest liability as he strains to remake the tarnished image of the state he has governed for the last seven years.\n\nNewsom, with his smooth-talking, rapid-fire responses and his attempt to out-Trump Trump on social media aggression, is everything Kamala Harris wasn’t in 2024. But neither Californian can easily shake the biggest millstone dragging down their White House ambitions. Their failed progressive policies have sullied the Golden State’s image, driving up prices, homelessness, and mismanagement. The failures have not only driven citizens away but are also likely to turn off voters in swing battleground districts as well.\n\nCalifornia’s failures weren’t Harris’ biggest weakness in 2024 – her word salads were. But the Golden State’s downward spiral was a close second.\n\nAs wildfire victims held vigils and prayer circles on the anniversary of the devastating Palisades and Eaton fires, Newsom on Thursday attempted to flip the script on California’s role as a GOP punchline.\n\nIn his final State-of-the-State address after years of releasing video-taped remarks, Newsom cast Trump’s control of Washington as a “carnival of chaos” amid the Democratic furor over an ICE agent shooting and killing a woman in Minnesota. He then positioned California as a “beacon” of fairness and resistance to Trump’s heavy-handed Washington rule.\n\nAddressing the California legislature, which had just observed a moment of silence for the slain Minnesota woman, Renee Nicole Good, Newsom repeatedly pointed to Trump as a power-hungry threat to democracy who abused his power to call in the National Guard to quell unrest over ICE arrests and raids.\n\n“The president believes that might makes right, that the courts are simply speed bumps, not stops. That democracy is a nuisance to be circumvented. Secret police, businesses being raided, windows smashed, citizens detained, citizens shot, masked men snatching, people in broad daylight, people disappearing,” Newsom charged.\n\n“None of this is normal,” he added.\n\nAfter throwing out the red meat for the Democratic base, Newsom then set out to normalize California’s dizzying array of failures under his watch.\n\n“The state is providing a different narrative — an operational model, a policy blueprint for others to follow,” he told state lawmakers.\n\nNewsom’s defiant defense of his state as a shining example for others to emulate may come as a shock for those who haven’t been watching his reinvention as a social media agitator and leader of the national redistricting battle.\n\nBut Newsom’s attempt to go on offense on his biggest weakness – his policy failures – was his most audacious and sweeping thus far. After mimicking Trump’s belligerent social media style, Newsom stole another Trump play, labeling the state’s critics as suffering from “California Derangement syndrome,” a revision of the “Trump Derangement Syndrome,” which MAGA world deploys to brush off condemnation.\n\n“The declinists,” the pundits and conservative critics simply don’t know the updated facts, Newsom asserted, arguing that they are working to “tear down, to try to attack all of our progress.”\n\nEarly data for 2025, he said, indicate a 9% decline in homelessness, the first drop after an explosion of unsheltered people in California. He failed to mention that from 2019 to 2024, under his watch, homelessness rose to 188,000, a net increase of 37,000, or 24%, even though the state spent roughly $24 billion trying to curb it.\n\n“So, our investments paid off,” he claimed without an explanation.\n\nNewsom acknowledged that the decline was “not good enough,” and more work needs to be done as long as big homeless encampments still exist in major cities around the state. He failed to mention the high number of homelessness deaths across the state that could be contributing to the 9% decline, as well as the danger of allowing any encampments to remain.\n\nJust hours after the speech, a fire at a homeless camp in a Los Angeles suburb broke out, the second in the last two weeks.\n\nNewsom also claimed credit for “double-digit decreases in crime” across California, without acknowledging that those figures are still higher than pre-pandemic levels in some areas and that property crime continues to plague major cities such as San Francisco and Los Angeles.\n\nWhile touting minor California successes, he often followed up by acknowledging that there is still “work to do” when it comes to bringing down housing costs, overall “affordability,” lowering crime rates, and improving fire insurance coverage.\n\nThough he noted that he had debated whether or not to mention high-speed rail, another frequent target for fiscal conservative attacks, he hailed the $13.8 billion spent so far and progress on projects in the state’s agricultural Central Valley as one of the “great economic investments” in the region. Those lines, he said, “will make commute times shorter and make life more affordable.” He failed to mention that the project was launched in 2008, and more than 17 years later, no trains are running.\n\nNewsom even touted California’s status as having the highest taxes of any state in the country, stressing that Democrats in the state had designed the most “progressive” system in the country, which he argued is far fairer for middle-class and low-wage earners.\n\n“So, the question to all of you — who are the high tax states? Just consider Texas. Just consider Florida, the two most regressive tax states in America,” Newsom said. “They’re hammering their low-income earners. They’re hammering them more than their wealthiest. Who are the high-tax states? California stands for fairness.”\n\nCalifornia Republican Party Chairwoman Corrin Rankin, responding to the address, cast Newsom as not only out of touch but deranged.\n\n“Governor Newsom told Californians that homelessness is down, crime is at record lows, schools are improving, and Los Angeles is recovering after the Palisades fires,” she said. “Governor Newsom painted a picture of a California that exists in his imagination.”\n\nRep. Kevin Kiley, a Republican representing parts of Sacramento in Congress, assailed the address as pure gaslighting.\n\n“For once, Newsom is right,” he said. “California has led the nation during his tenure – in homelessness, unemployment, poverty, illiteracy, gas prices, electricity costs, debt, and outmigration. That is the true state of our state.”\n\nKiley also provided a preview of the conservative line of attack that could haunt the governor leading into the 2028 presidential race.\n\n“California, also, of course, leads the nation in fraud … Minnesota’s fraud scandals have just ended Tim Walz’s political career,” Kiley said. “California’s should likewise end Gavin Newsom’s.”\n\nSusan Crabtree is RealClearPolitics' national political correspondent.","summary":"It's an odd predicament for a leading Democratic presidential contender.

I mean, he's a stupid person,” the president continued.\n\nTrump then pivoted to false claims that he won Minnesota in the last three presidential elections. “It’s a corrupt state, a corrupt voting state, and the Republicans ought to get smart and demand on voter ID,” he said. “They ought to demand maybe same day voting and all of the other things that you have to have the safe election.”\n\n“I won Minnesota three times and I didn’t get credit for it.

Jesse Ventura and slammed President Trump and hinted at another run for office.\n\nVentura called Trump \"the draft-dodging coward who, when it was his time to serve his country, he did what all rich white boys did. I wasn’t a rich white boy. We had to go,\" Ventura, 74, a Vietnam veteran and former Navy SEAL, told local reporters Jan. 8 when asked about the shooting of Renee Nicole Good. \"He’s gonna tell me what courage is?\"\n\n“What occurred yesterday did not have to happen,\" Ventura told reporters, calling Good's shooting a \"tragedy\" and a \"murder.\"\n\n\"We're a third-world country now,\" said Ventura, the WWE pro wrestling hall of famer who was Minnesota governor from 1999 to 2003. \"You wanna know why?

Wire\n\nTreasury announces new initiatives targeting fraud in Minnesota\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced new initiatives targeting fraudsters in Minnesota on Friday which he said will be the “genesis for a national rollout.”\n\nThe announcement comes amid a deepening fraud scandal that's enveloped state and national politics. Federal prosecutors say billions of dollars have been bilked from government-backed social programs in Minnesota since the pandemic. The DOJ has charged more than 80 people in the scandal, many of them U.S. citizens of Somali descent.\n\nBessent said the Treasury Department has notified four money service businesses in the greater Minneapolis-St. Paul area, which may have transferred taxpayer funds out of the U.S., that they are under investigation. Bessent said the department is specifically investigating money sent to Somalia.\n\nBessent said the IRS is also auditing financial institutions in Minnesota that facilitated money laundering and will launch a task force to investigate organizations implicated in sprawling fraud schemes. “Treasury will deploy all tools, all tools, to bring an end to this egregious, unchecked fraud and hold perpetrators to account,” Bessent said.\n\n– N'dea yancey-Bragg\n\nMinneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey remains defiant\n\nFrey has received criticism from Republicans over what they've described as inflammatory comments in the wake of the Minneapolis ICE shooting.\n\nAt a Friday news conference, Frey dug in further, saying he stands by his earlier statements refuting the Trump administration's description of the shooting.\n\n\"What I said was it was a reckless abuse of power. Yes, it was a reckless abuse of power,\" Frey said, speaking about the deadly incident. \"I said that the narrative the administration was pushing in the immediacy following this shooting was garbage and false and BS. It was.”\n\nDHS identifies two people shot by Border Patrol agent in Portland\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security on Friday identified the two people shot by a Border Patrol agent in Portland.\n\nThe driver of the vehicle was Luis David Nico Moncada, who DHS described as a suspected \"Tren de Aragua gang member.\" The agency said he entered the U.S. in 2022 and has previously faced charges for drunk driving and unauthorized use of a vehicle.\n\nThe passenger, who was the target of the traffic stop that led to the shooting, was identified as Yorlenys Betzabeth Zambrano-Contreras. DHS described her as an undocumented immigrant from Venezuela who \"played an active role in a Tren de Aragua prostitution ring and is connected to a recent shooting in Portland.\"\n\nBoth Moncada and Zambrano-Contreras remained in the hospital. They will be released into FBI custody, DHS said.\n\nWhat we know about investigations into Portland, Minneapolis shootings\n\nOregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield said the state's Department of Justice is investigating the shooting in Portland involving a Border Patrol agent.\n\nRayfield said the investigation will probe whether \"any federal officer acted outside the scope of their lawful authority.\" Cases may be referred to the Multnomah County district attorney if evidence of criminal conduct is found, Rayfield added.\n\nIn Minneapolis, the state said it was forced to withdraw from an investigation after federal authorities blocked them from accessing evidence. State and local officials in Minnesota have pressed for an independent investigation into the ICE agent's use of deadly force, raising concerns about the integrity of a federal probe.\n\nUse of force experts analyze footage of Minneapolis shooting\n\nSeveral criminal justice experts viewed the footage of the Minneapolis shooting, which the Trump administration described as self-defense and state officials called a reckless abuse of power.\n\nDiane Goldstein, a former police lieutenant and executive director of the nonprofit Law Enforcement Action Partnership, described the agent’s tactics in Minneapolis as \"horrible\" and “aggressive.”\n\n“Law enforcement policy should always be about using the least amount of force and preserving people’s lives,” Goldstein told USA TODAY. She added that the footage suggests “a lack of training and a lack of understanding of what other tactics are available to de-escalate these types of situations.”\n\nGeoffrey Alpert, a professor of criminology at the University of South Carolina, said a full investigation is needed, but said the video appears to contradict the Trump administration's description of the incident. “It clearly looks like she was driving away,” Alpert said. “She turned her wheel and looked like she was trying to escape.”\n\nMore: Was ICE agent's use of force reckless? Experts analyze Minneapolis shooting.\n\nProtests intensify after shootings by immigration agents\n\nIn the aftermath of two shootings involving immigration agents, protesters on Thursday took to the streets to oppose the federal intervention.\n\nA demonstration was held at an ICE facility in the South Portland neighborhood, which has been a consistent site for protests since last summer. The Portland Police Bureau said its officers arrested six people on suspicion of disorderly conduct and other charges.\n\nIn Minneapolis, thousands gathered for a second night of protests. The demonstrations were largely peaceful, but tensions occasionally flared, leading federal agents to use pepper spray and tear gas.\n\n‘People need to quit demonstrating’\n\nTexas Republican Rep. Roger Williams told NewsMax Friday that clashes will continue as long as Americans keep challenging immigration officials.\n\n“We need to see some improvement in the fact that people need to quit demonstrating, quit yelling at law enforcement, challenging law enforcement, and begin to get civil,\" he said. \"And until we do that, I guess we’re going to have it this way and the people that are staying in their homes, are doing the right thing, need to be protected.”\n\n–Sarah D. Wire\n\nWalz declares Friday 'Day of Unity' to honor Renee Good\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz declared Friday a “Day of Unity” to honor Good. The governor asked Minnesotans and people across the country to observe a moment of silence at 10 a.m. to remember Good.\n\n“Now is a time to mourn together, in peace, unity, and service. People across Minnesota will peacefully stand up for shared American values,” Walz said in the proclamation.\n\nThe proclamation encouraged neighbors, families, and community members to \"care for one another in our time of grief.\" It also called on churches and faith organizations to open their doors, for community members to support local businesses, and Minnesotans to participate in acts of service for their communities.\n\n\"This is a moment for us to use our collective voice to stand for decency and democracy,\" Walz said.\n\nOregon senator calls for ICE to 'get the hell out'\n\nOregon state Senate Majority Leader Kayse Jama, D-Portland, echoed calls against Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\n\"We do not need you,\" Jama said during a news conference on Thursday evening. \"You’re not welcome here and you need to get the hell out of our community.\"\n\nJama’s message came after Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey gave fiery comments at a news conference after the fatal shooting of Good by immigration agents. State and local officials have demanded that federal authorities conduct a full and transparent investigation into the shooting.\n\nPortland Mayor Keith Wilson has called on ICE to halt all operations in the city until an investigation is completed.\n\n\"We know what the federal government says happened here,\" Wilson said at the news conference. \"There was a time when we could take them at their word. That time is long past.\"\n\nShooting in Oregon latest involving immigration agents\n\nThe shooting in Portland is just the latest involving federal agents carrying out Trump’s immigration enforcement around the country.\n\nOn Wednesday, Good was fatally shot by immigration agents in Minneapolis. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Good \"weaponized\" her SUV to run over agents in an act of \"domestic terrorism.\" Local officials, citing video of the incident, vehemently disputed Noem’s account and called for the officer involved to be arrested.\n\nIn Maryland on Dec. 24, two people were wounded during an immigration enforcement action when the driver of the vehicle attempted to run over federal agents, according to federal officials. Agents at the scene shot the driver, and he crashed the vehicle. The passenger was wounded in the crash.\n\nSilverio Villegas-Gonzalez, a 38-year-old Mexican immigrant, was shot and killed by federal agents outside Chicago on Sept. 12. Homeland Security officials said the man resisted arrest and dragged an agent with his car. Video evidence from the scene shows the agent describing his wounds as \"nothing major.\" Villegas-Gonzalez’s lawyer and others have called for a full investigation into the shooting.\n\n– Michael Loria\n\nICE officer in shooting was Iraq vet, ex-Border Patrol\n\nThe federal immigration officer who shot and killed a woman in Minneapolis this week is a U.S. Army veteran with deployments to Iraq and years of experience, newly released records show.\n\nJonathan Ross, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement removal officer based in Minnesota, told a court about his career in December, during the criminal trial of a man who dragged Ross with a car, badly cutting Ross' arm and hand.\n\nRoss told the court he served in the Indiana National Guard and deployed from 2004 to 2005 to Iraq as a machine gunner on a gun truck and served on a combat logistical patrol team, delivering essential supplies in dangerous areas.\n\n– Nick Penzenstadler\n\nICE agent who fatally shot Minnesota woman identified\n\nThe immigration officer involved in this week's fatal shooting in Minneapolis is the same officer who was injured in June 2025 in another vehicle incident. He was identified in court documents as Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Jonathan Ross.\n\nOfficials declined to independently name Ross, but said he had at least 10 years of experience as an ICE officer and served on the agency's Special Response Team. Vice President JD Vance noted at the White House that this week's shooting incident echoed the agent's previous case that put him in the hospital.\n\n\"That very ICE officer nearly had his life ended, dragged by a car six months ago with 30 stitches in his leg, so he’s a little sensitive about being rammed by an automobile,\" Vance said at the White House on Thursday. The vice president did not directly name Ross at the briefing.

Gretchen Whitmer leads Michigan and a social media empire","text":"A group of reporters followed closely behind Gov. Gretchen Whitmer as she traversed the labyrinth display of cars at the 2025 Detroit Auto Show. Stopping at the Detroit Lions-themed Ford F-150, her team took over. \"This is how the magic's made,\" she said as the camera rolled.\n\nAs she tried to open the tailgate, she fumbled with the handle, laughing it off before hopping on the bed of the truck and pleading with her staff. \"Please don't make me do it again,\" she said.\n\nThe hiccup had onlookers smiling and laughing, giving Whitmer the same reception to a playfulness that has made her a social media celebrity.\n\nMichigan's top politician has spent years growing a digital empire that allows her to connect directly with a national audience. In addition to her own channels, she has also embedded herself in an online ecosystem of influencers. While her predecessors dabbled in social media in its nascent days, Whitmer has taken it to a new level, outpacing most other governors with the following she has amassed. That benefits Whitmer's political brand. But media experts warn that the broader trend of politicians turning away from engagement with traditional media and the questions and context it provides comes at a cost to the public and politicians themselves. \n\nDespite the time spent filming social media videos and a team charged with managing a steady stream of posts that make her a familiar face online, Whitmer said she doesn't think of herself as an influencer. \"My children would roll their eyes and laugh out loud if they heard that,\" she said in an interview last year with the Free Press.\n\nPolitical communications professionals disagree with Whitmer's self-assessment.\n\n\"I mean she's one of the best-known governors in America, and it's not based on her policy work or her ability to run the legislative part of the state. It's based on her decision to be in marketing and to be in advertising,\" said Andrea Bitely, founder of the Lansing-based public relations firm Bitely Communications, in an interview before she joined former Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan's independent gubernatorial campaign as its chief communications officer.\n\n\"When you review what she's done on TikTok, she isn't hoping she becomes an influencer or has her own media presence. She has already built one. She's already there,\" said John Sellek, Chief Strategist and CEO of Lansing-based public relations and affairs agency Harbor Strategic.\n\nMore: Benson says health care affordability a priority if elected governor\n\nMore: Gov. Whitmer appoints 2 judges, one in Macomb, other in Ann Arbor\n\nSome young people familiar with Whitmer's social media said the governor's embrace of online trends makes her more relatable. For Wayne State University student Amely Lora, 18, of Woodhaven, \"when you see somebody who is a politician doing something that you would do, it's like humanizing somebody who you don't really view as human.\" But she acknowledged that the image a politician curates online doesn't offer the full picture. \"Because a politician is a politician and propaganda does exist, and they do say things that make it seem like they're a saint,\" Lora said.\n\nWhitmer's office declined a request for an interview with Digital and Creative Director Julia Pickett on the governor's social media strategy, and a request to shadow the governor making a social media video. In doing so, Whitmer Press Secretary Stacey LaRouche called the Free Press' interest flattering but described the governor's approach as in keeping with what many businesses are doing.\n\nEven if it amounts to the equivalent in modern politics of corporate marketing, the governor herself has described her approach as cutting-edge. \"While we governors are a competitive group, it is objectively true (in my subjective opinion) that I have the most creative social media of any of them,\" she writes in her book \"True Gretch: What I've Learned About Life, Leadership, and Everything in Between.\"\n\nWhitmer's social media wins awards, garners backlash\n\nBefore developing political ambitions, Whitmer aspired to become a sports reporter for ESPN while attending Michigan State University, where she studied communications. As governor, she has found a platform to realize her broadcasting dreams.\n\nIn one video ahead of the NFL draft in Detroit in 2024, Whitmer bops around a downtown sports bar asking notable guests — such as sportscaster Mike Tirico — who the Lions might beat in the Super Bowl. In another, she interviews retired U.S. Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., in Lansing about her political career after naming a new building after her.\n\nShe also uses social media to highlight her policy agenda, from road funding to abortion rights. In one series of videos before President Donald Trump signed the GOP tax and spending bill into law in July, Whitmer posted conversations she had with Medicaid recipients staring down funding cuts.\n\nWhitmer's accounts also feature lighter fare, including videos of her dogs — Kevin and Doug. In one, she puts on a kind of fashion show, posing in her collection of leather jackets.\n\nWhitmer won awards in 2024 for a social media campaign tied to the release of the blockbuster Barbie movie. Posts to the governor's account featured images of a doll version of Whitmer named \"Lil' Gretch\" signing miniature bills and delivering a speech behind a small podium with a pink sign reading \"Make it in Michigan.\" The campaign won a Shorty and a Webby Award for Public Service and Activism, making her the first elected official to receive an award in that category, according to her office.\n\nIn addition to the awards, Whitmer has also faced backlash for her online presence. In one video, she appears to riff on the social media trend of people feeding each other, popularized by late-night television host Stephen Colbert feeding actor Jeremy Allen from \"The Bear\" a pizza. Mimicking the gesture, Whitmer feeds a nacho cheese Dorito to podcaster Liz Plank in an Instagram video posted in October 2024. The clip drew condemnation from the Michigan Catholic Conference, which said it imitated the act of receiving Communion.\n\nAsked about her social media strategy and the Dorito video flop, Whitmer said, \"I just know that we need to reach people in a variety of ways.\" No matter where someone seeks out information, Whitmer said she wants her message to be heard. \"And so I listen to my youthful, creative team and you know we're always hitting for the fences. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, but I'm always going to try,\" she said.\n\nConnecting with a national audience and hard-to-reach voters\n\nToday's politicians find themselves navigating a nationalized media environment, according to University of Michigan professor of communication and media and political science Josh Pasek, whose research focuses on the effects of social media on the political information landscape. \"You've got to play to this sort of national audience to get your couple moments of fame to even be recognized in your state,\" he said. Short attention spans and a plethora of information streams mean politicians have an incentive try to find ways to connect directly with voters, he said.\n\n\"It's very much the strategy that drove Trump's popularity in the first place,\" he said. \"And that is the strategy right now because otherwise you're basically lost in the mix.\"\n\nLaura Carlson, chief digital officer for the Democratic Governors Association, celebrated Whitmer's social media style, describing her as at the forefront in her experimentation with social media trends. \"I think she's one of our party's best messengers,\" she said. \"She's just able to be naturally authentic and unscripted. Folks can hear directly from her in a way that just feels true to who she is,\" Carlson added.\n\nWhitmer seems to be reaching young voters with her videos. A 2024 Pew Research Center report found young adults are far more likely to use platforms favored by Whitmer — Instagram and TikTok — compared with older adults. The dichotomy was apparent to Sellek when he spoke at Central Michigan University and mentioned the Whitmer Dorito video, which he said younger people in the audience were familiar with, while older attendees were not.\n\nIn addition to Whitmer's large social media audience, she has reached beyond her own following by tapping into a network of online personalities like Plank, granting them extended interviews she seldom gives to traditional reporters.\n\nFor instance, Whitmer spent about an hour talking about Michigan's state budget and economy with YouTube star Caleb Hammer, whose videos typically feature him auditing the personal finances of his guests. It came at the end of a budget cycle that didn't feature a news conference like past years, in which Whitmer tackled reporters' questions on her spending priorities.\n\nWhitmer also once spent an hour playing a video game called Stardew Valley during a livestream with Refinery29, a website focused on young women. In between fielding questions on tariffs and her relationship with Trump, a Whitmer avatar in the game watered some plants and slept in a little cabin in a virtual \"Great Lakes Farm.\" While Whitmer talked about her political priorities, she also weighed in on goofy questions such as her hypothetical \"dream blunt rotation\" (she picked Snoop Dogg, Willie Nelson and Seth Rogen).\n\nWhitmer kicked off 2026 with an appearance on a Detroit sports podcast, \"Ozzy and Keats,\" hosted by former Detroit Red Wing Chris Osgood and broadcaster John Keating who interviewed the governor at the end of last year. \"Zero politics,\" boasts a description of the episode. Meanwhile, more than two months have passed since the governor held an event where she took questions from Michigan reporters. She last scrummed with Michigan reporters in November, fielding questions about her support for a controversial data center project in Saline Township and plans for state action to blunt the impact of federal spending fights.\n\nShannon Custer McGregor — an associate professor at the Hussman School of Journalism and Media at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill — explained politicians take interviews with online influencers because it helps them connect with a hard-to-reach audience that isn't there for political content. Such engagement became a hallmark of the 2024 campaign between former Vice President Kamala Harris' appearance on the podcast \"Call Her Daddy,\" known for content focused on sexual relationships, and Trump's three-hour-long interview on Joe Rogan's podcast, which significantly delayed his rally appearance in Traverse City in the final stretch of the race.\n\n\"I understand that you have to talk to the podcasters and bloggers and the influencers in this day in age,\" said Michigan Press Association Public Policy Manager Lisa McGraw. \"But I think that we need to acknowledge that there's still a very significant place for traditional media,\" she added. She likened the nontraditional outlets that have thrived in the online era to sugary entertainment and traditional reporting to nutritious news. \"And you still have to eat your broccoli if you want to be an informed citizen,\" she said.\n\nIt may also have consequences for the politicians who prioritize nontraditional media. \"If we have politicians who will only communicate to people through those outlets, they're losing a large audience, and I might argue it's an audience that actually votes,\" McGraw said. While taking questions from the news media opens the door to politicians giving an answer they may regret, the give and take can also help them think on their feet, said Sellek of the public relations and affairs agency Harbor Strategic. \"You get sharper by having to fight out your proposals in public,\" he said.\n\nWhile Whitmer doesn't shy away from the camera, an iconic image captured a time she didn't want her photo taken.\n\nWhen Whitmer went to the Oval Office expecting a meeting with Trump and found herself in the middle of a news conference instead, she covered her face with folders in an apparent panic. The New York Times captured the moment she tried to hide from the cameras. The image came to symbolize the tightrope Democrats walk in trying to work with Trump.\n\nSellek described it as an uncharacteristic mistake that belied Whitmer's history as an effective communicator. Whitmer later smiled about the slipup from the stage of the Detroit Economic Club, where she repeated the gesture, mocking herself. \"I mean I just wrote a book about learning to laugh at yourself, so I'm pretty good at it,\" she said.\n\nThat signature humor is a through line, whether navigating an unwanted spotlight from traditional media or churning out content for her own social media channels.\n\nContact Clara Hendrickson: chendrickson@freepress.com or 313-296-5743.","url":"https://eu.freep.com/story/news/politics/2026/01/09/gretchen-whitmer-michigan-social-media/85713253007/","image":"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2025/01/15/PDTF/77721066007-rs-15573.JPEG?auto=webp&crop=2999,1687,x0,y0&format=pjpg&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-09 11:01:02","author":"Detroit Free Press","authors":["Detroit Free Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.043},{"id":392093310,"title":"16 celebrities and reality TV stars who turned to politics from Trump to Katie Price","text":"Trisha Paytas‘ announcement that she intends to run for a seat in the US House of Representatives in her home state, California, has come as a surprise to many.\n\nAs someone put on X/Twitter on Tuesday (6 January): “Trisha Paytas announcing that she is running for the House of Representatives was not on my 2026 bingo card.”\n\nSince then, Spencer Pratt, a reality TV star, has announced his own political aspirations by launching a campaign to become the Mayor of Los Angeles.\n\nBut should we be surprised at this point? And even more so, should we doubt their ability to succeed? Have we also not learned from who’s in the White House (for a second time!).\n\nPaytas, Pratt, and even Donald Trump are hardly the first celebrities to turn to politics. Here’s a few more. \n\nTrisha Paytas\n\nThe YouTuber and podcast host announced her intention to run for the US House of Representatives in a video titled “2026 MANIFESTATIONS”. \n\nPosted on Tuesday, it sees Paytas enjoying a meal from the notoriously anti-LGBTQ+ food chain, Chick-fil-A, and explaining some of her thoughts.\n\nIn a TikTok video, also posted on Tuesday, Paytas added: “I never thought of myself as a political person until I started having kids and realising, like, the world could be just so disastrous.”\n\nOne thing she’s expressed an interest in doing is introducing a bill making sex work legal from the age of 25. \n\nSpencer Pratt\n\nStarting his reality TV career in the early 2000s with shows like The Princes of Malibu and The Hills, Pratt went on to feature in I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here and the UK’s Celebrity Big Brother. \n\nPratt announced his bid for LA Mayor on Wednesday (7 January) at an event organised by those who lost their homes in the 2025 Palisades Fire where Pratt and his wife, Heidi Montag, also live. \n\nThe BBC reported Pratt said: “Business as usual is a death sentence for Los Angeles.” He also said: “I’m done waiting for someone to take real action. That’s why I am running for mayor.”\n\nDonald Trump\n\nPerhaps the most well known celebrity to have entered politics (and succeeded, twice) is President Donald J. Trump. \n\nThe Celebrity Apprentice star first ran for the Presidency in 2016, defeating the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton.\n\nIt was a chaotic presidency with Trump taking many anti-LGBTQ+ actions. Thankfully it ended in 2020 when Joe Biden won the Presidency. \n\nSadly, Trump never went away and defeated Kamala Harris in 2024 to return to the White House a year ago. Need we say more…\n\nCynthia Nixon\n\nThe Sex and the City star announced her bid to run for the Governor of New York in March 2018. Quickly she was put down by a senior Democrat who described her as “an unqualified lesbian”.\n\nTaking a progressive stance, Nixon challenged Andrew Cuomo and could have been the state’s first out-gay governor.\n\nSadly, she wasn’t well supported by Democrats and LGBTQ+ groups including the Stonewall Democrats, the Democratic Party’s official LGBT caucus. \n\nShe ultimately lost the primary race to Cuomo but has remained a passionate advocate since. \n\nArnold Schwarzenegger \n\nFamous for roles such as The Terminator and Kindergarten Cop, few (if anyone) could have predicted that such a star would turn to politics at all. Though, this was pre-Trump.\n\nSchwarzenegger, a Republican, first ran for the Governor of California position in 2003, getting elected in a recall election. He was later re-elected in 2006.\n\nThroughout his time as Governor, Schwarzenegger called for more spending on US infrastructure as well as a deadline for the withdrawal of US troops from Iraq after the 2003 invasion. \n\nVolodymyr Zelenskyy\n\nFamously a comedian and broadcaster before he became the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy also featured on Ukraine’s version of Dancing with the Stars, winning in 2006.\n\nZelenskyy also dubbed the voice of Paddington Bear for 2014’s Paddington and 2017’s Paddington 2. He also starred in the TV series Servant of the People in which he played a teacher who won the Ukrainian Presidential election.\n\nIn 2018 he announced he was running for the actual position of President, running on a platform of anti-establishment and inclusionary politics.\n\nIn 2019, he was elected with 73% of the vote, ousting Petro Poroshenko. He has since gone on to lead his country through Russia’s invasion. \n\nSuzy Eddie Izzard\n\nThe actor and comedian came out as trans in 1985 and is known for films such as Five Children and It, Dress to Kill, and Force Majeure.\n\nIn 2023, she put her name forward to be the Labour candidate for Brighton Pavilion at the 2024 general election. \n\nBut she was not selected, with the Mercury-Prize-winning musician Tom Gray contesting the seat for Labour instead. It was her second attempt after trying the same in Sheffield Central in 2022.\n\nPlacing second on American Idol in 2003 it would be another 11 years before Aiken tried his hand at politics. \n\nIn 2014, he ran for North Carolina’s second congressional district in the US House of Representatives. While he won the Democratic primary he was defeated by the Republican candidate, Renee Ellmers.\n\nAiken then tried running in another North Carolina district in 2022 but was defeated in the primary stage. He aimed to challenge White supremacy, racism and homophobia.\n\nDave Rowntree \n\nBlur’s drummer has run unsuccessfully for seats on Westminster City Council as well as to become the MP for the Cities of London and Westminster and Norwich South over the years. \n\nIn 2017 he was elected as a county councillor for the University ward of Norfolk County Council, which he left prior to the 2021 election.\n\nThen in 2024, the Blur band member was selected by Labour as the candidate for the Mid Sussex Parliamentary seat. He was beaten in the race by the Liberal Democrat candidate, Alison Bennett. \n\nRonald Reagan\n\nA former actor, Reagan‘s time as President is a painful one for the LGBTQ+ community given it’s remembered for a disastrously slow response to the HIV/AIDs crisis of the 1980s.\n\nReagan’s silence on the issue is considered to have led to the deaths of thousands of people across the US, including Reagan’s friend and Hollywood actor, Rock Hudson.\n\nIn 1982, when Reagan’s press secretary was asked if the president was tracking the spread of “the gay plague”, the room erupted in laughter as he replied: “I don’t have it, do you?”\n\nStacey Dash\n\nThe Clueless and CSI star and former Democrat announced her run as a Republican candidate for California’s 44th Congressional District in February 2018.\n\nIt was a short lived run however, as she exited the race a month later citing “overall bitterness surrounding our political process” and the rigours of campaigning as her reasons. \n\nKatie Price\n\nAt 23, Katie Price – aka Jordan – ran as an Independent MP for the Stretford and Urmston seat in the 2001 election with the campaign slogan: “For a Bigger and Betta Future.”\n\nSpeaking at an event in Old Trafford, the model said: “My policies are to make things fun. The election is boring. I’m here to spice things up,” as reported by the BBC.\n\nShe also promised free plastic surgery as well as cheap package holidays on the National Health Service… Ultimately, she only got 713 votes and lost the race.\n\nKanye ‘Ye’ West\n\nIn July 2020, West announced he intended to run in the Presidential election taking place that year. \n\nPreviously a Trump supporter, he ran independently as the Birthday Party. He explained to Forbes: “When we win, it’s everybody’s ‘birthday’.”\n\nPitching his America-first as well as faith-based run as a way to disrupt the two-party political system in the US, West failed to make much headway, only capturing 66,365 votes in the few states he was on the ballot for.\n\nWest also said he’d run in 2024 but it was confirmed in 2023 he was not.\n\nShirley Temple\n\nThe famed child actress entered politics in her late thirties with an unsuccessful run at becoming the representative of California’s 11th congressional district for the Republicans in 1967.\n\nWhile that didn’t work out for the iconic screen star, she later became a delegate to the United Nations General Assembly for President Nixon between 1969 and 1970. \n\nShe was then made the US Ambassador to Ghana between 1974 and 1976 by President Ford, before serving as the US Ambassador to Czechoslovakia under George H. W. Bush between 1989 and 1992.\n\nThe Harold & Kumar star, who came out publicly in 2021, joined President Obama’s administration in 2009. \n\nIn his role as Associate Director of the White House Office of Public Engagement and Intergovernmental Affairs, Penn worked as a liaison between Obama and Asian-American, as well as Pacific Islander communities.\n\nHe also served as a co-chair of Obama’s reelection campaign in 2012, later joining the President’s Committee on the Arts and Humanities. \n\nHe has since supported Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, and Kamala Harris in their presidential elections, as well as Zohran Mamdani in his successful run at becoming New York’s Mayor.\n\nCaitlyn Jenner\n\nThe former Olympian and also reality TV star launched her campaign to be the governor of California in 2021 describing herself as a “compassionate disruptor”.\n\nThe Republican and Trump supporter finished in 13th place in the end, securing just one percent of the vote after a campaign in which she said trans girls shouldn’t be allowed to play in school sports teams that correspond with their gender identity.\n\nShare your thoughts!

Trump dismantled many of President Joe Biden's drug addiction policies. He says they were a failure. But researchers found fentanyl smuggling into the U.S. plunged under the Biden administration and overdose deaths also fell. NPR addiction correspondent Brian Mann is here. Brian, what does this new research say?\n\nBRIAN MANN, BYLINE: Well, A, this report really adds in fascinating ways to research showing the Biden administration made unprecedented progress, disrupting the illegal smuggling routes that were flooding U.S. communities with fentanyl. I spoke about this with Keith Humphreys. He's at Stanford University, one of the co-lead authors. And he says they studied fentanyl seizures. They found purity and potency dropped dramatically after 2023. And Humphreys' team of researchers also surveyed social media. They were looking for references to the fact that street supplies of the drug were drying up.\n\nKEITH HUMPHREYS: We start looking for shortage - the word shortage - or weaker. My fentanyl's not strong enough. I'm not getting high anymore - all these kinds of phrases. And there's an explosion, a 14-fold increase in the mention of these terms right when overdoses start dropping.\n\nMANN: And this paper in Science, A, found fentanyl deaths in Biden's final year in office dropped by more than a third from the peak in 2023. That kind of progress is just unheard of. And this paper builds on a lot of other research, as well as an analysis by the Drug Enforcement Administration that all show similar progress.\n\nMARTÍNEZ: How did the Biden administration do this?\n\nMANN: Yeah, it's pretty remarkable. When I first started reporting on fentanyl, A, most experts said stopping this drug or even slow [inaudible] significantly would be nearly impossible. That's because fentanyl is just easy to make from industrial chemicals. So drug policy experts I've been speaking to think Biden expanded health care and drug addiction treatment programs in ways that saved lives. And this new paper suggests Biden's team also convinced China to help curb the sale of so-called precursor chemicals that are needed to make fentanyl in ways that really hit the drug gangs hard. Again, here's Keith Humphreys.\n\nHUMPHREYS: Biden's people - the foreign policy people - can feel very proud that they made a positive impact.\n\nMANN: Now, here's something interesting. Humphreys and addiction researchers I've been speaking to think Biden made real progress on fentanyl but then failed to tell the American public about those policy gains.\n\nHUMPHREYS: I think it hurt them because they had a story of success to tell.\n\nMANN: And you may remember, A, that during the presidential campaign, Trump really clobbered Biden on the fentanyl issue. Trump claimed falsely that no progress was being made reducing overdose deaths.\n\nMARTÍNEZ: So if Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris had this information, why didn't they use it? Why didn't they talk about this?\n\nMANN: You know, it's a real mystery, especially because some of the biggest improvements on fentanyl were happening in political battleground states like Ohio and Pennsylvania. I reached out to Kamala Harris and members of the Biden and Harris campaigns to ask about their messaging on fentanyl, and I got no response.\n\nTalking with addiction and drug policy experts, I did hear one interesting theory. Despite these plummeting fentanyl deaths and Biden's success, they think Trump succeeded in reframing this as a border issue, part of the wider migrant crisis. And that's brought sweeping consequences. Trump has now dismantled many of Biden's fentanyl policies, and he's shifted to a new range of policies from trade tariffs to an increasingly militarized drug war.\n\nMARTÍNEZ: All right. That's NPR's Brian Mann. Brian, thanks.\n\nMANN: Thank you, A.\n\nCopyright © 2026 NPR. All rights reserved.

Rallies and protests continued Friday after Homeland Security shared a new video of the fatal altercation on social media that purports to show the view of the officer involved.\n\nMembers of the Trump administration said the video vindicates the officer’s actions, which they have insisted were in self-defence. Some Minneapolis residents are saying it does nothing of the kind.\n\nMinneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey told a news conference earlier Friday that his community fears the outcome of a federal probe into the shooting has been determined already.\n\n“This is not the time to bend the rules. This is the time to follow the law,” Frey said. “This is not a time to hide from the facts. This is a time to embrace them, making sure that we are pushing for transparency every step of the way.”\n\nFrey called for the Minnesota agency that probes shootings involving officers to take part in the investigation. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has said it does not have jurisdiction.\n\nFrey said there is a perception abroad that the Trump administration has decided the outcome of the investigation already and it’s critical to include independent state investigators.\n\n“We in Minneapolis want a fair investigation,” he said.\n\nFrey and other local officials repeated their call for ICE to leave the area so that tensions can subside.\n\nCommunity members have created a makeshift system to warn people of the presence of ICE officers.\n\nWhen federal officials showed up at a home where construction workers were present Friday afternoon, neighbours ran out blowing whistles. The workers went indoors and neighbours continued sounding the alarm until the federal officers departed.\n\nElsewhere, people on bikes sat near 24 Somali Mall, talking about rumours that ICE had been seen nearby.\n\nMore than 2,000 ICE officers have descended on the area in what the Department of Homeland Security has described as the largest immigration enforcement operation ever.\n\nMinnesota was a political flashpoint before the shooting. U.S. President Donald Trump has made multiple verbal attacks on Gov. Tim Walz — former vice-president Kamala Harris’s 2024 running mate — and derogatory remarks toward the state’s Somali population.\n\nTrump last month called the Somali population “garbage” following a federal investigation into COVID-19 and medical aid fraud connected to organizations serving Somali immigrants and others.\n\nLocal resident Saleban Duale said the mistakes of a few don’t reflect the whole community and the Somali population has contributed greatly to Minnesota.\n\nThe Somali American Leadership Table organized a rally at the location of Good’s death to call for unity and accountability for ICE. Khalid Omar, who is involved with the organization, said it was also an opportunity to honour Good — who he said pushed back on ICE with a whistle and was killed by a gun.\n\n“It’s a moral duty as a neighbour and as a person, as an American, as a Minnesotan, for us to stand up,” Omar said.\n\nThe Somali population is in ICE’s sights after Trump attempted to use the fraud investigation to frame the state as a hotbed of government fraud. Trump claimed last month that Somalis “contribute nothing” and “we don’t want them in our country.”\n\nHe has repeatedly made crude statements about Minnesota Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar, who is Somali-American. The president has said he would end temporary protected status for Somalis in Minnesota.\n\nThe controversy ramped up last month after a conservative influencer posted unconfirmed claims that daycare centres run by Somalis in Minneapolis were also committing fraud and didn’t have any children registered.\n\nCiting concerns about fraud, Trump’s administration said Tuesday it would withhold funds from programs that support needy families with children in five Democratic-led states, including Minnesota. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent travelled to Minneapolis Friday to announce new measures to stop what he called “Somali fraudsters.”\n\nOmar said the Somali community in Minnesota is afraid. He said community members are being questioned by ICE officers at their places of worship and when they shop for groceries.\n\n“This administration is bringing a lot of fear and I think that’s their goal,” he said.\n\n“We are greater than fear. We believe this storm is going to pass.” \n\nAdding more fuel to the fire, federal immigration agents in Oregon shot and wounded two people in a vehicle outside a Portland hospital Thursday.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security said the vehicle’s passenger was “a Venezuelan illegal alien affiliated with the transnational Tren de Aragua prostitution ring” who was involved in a recent shooting in the city.\n\nThe department said that when agents identified themselves during a “targeted vehicle stop” in the afternoon, the driver tried to run them over.\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Jan. 9, 2026.\n\n— With files from The Associated Press","summary":"Renee Good was shot in the head Wednesday on Day 2 of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown on the Twin Cities of Minneapolis.","url":"https://www.thestar.com/news/world/united-states/minnesotans-continue-to-grapple-with-fatal-ice-shooting/article_848b8e02-b2c3-5ef8-9031-5a28b67af620.html","image":"https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/thestar.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/4/6d/46de1ddf-989e-5582-aa00-c3b5ca8cf69b/696066fd492db.image.jpg?crop=719%2C377%2C0%2C351","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-09 09:00:00","author":"Kelly Geraldine Malone The Canadian Press","authors":["Kelly Geraldine Malone The Canadian Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.255},{"id":392051862,"title":"Trump is gaslighting Americans – and they are no longer buying it","text":"On Wednesday, a woman was shot in the head and killed by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent in Minnesota, less than a mile from the spot where George Floyd was murdered by a policeman in 2020.\n\nBack then, the sense of dread that Donald Trump was presiding over an age of chaos and impunity was palpable, and led directly to his defeat by Joe Biden that year. If an election were held tomorrow, Trump would be beaten again.\n\nHere, but multiplied tenfold, are the same ingredients: a narcissistic US President, more intoxicated than ever by his own power, with out-of-control law enforcement officials and a country divided into two camps, unable to agree on the most basic facts.\n\nRenee Nicole Good, 37, a mother of three who described herself as a “poet and writer and wife and mom”, would appear to have been fired upon while trying to drive away from ICE agents during a protest against the round-up of illegal immigrants in Minneapolis. Her youngest son, aged six, is an orphan after his father died in 2023.\n\nThe left-wing congresswoman Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez called Good’s death “murder” and that’s what it looked like on video. However, Kristi Noem, the Homeland Security Secretary, who showed up at the press conference in a buccaneering ten-gallon cowboy hat, accused Good of “domestic terrorism”.\n\nTrump claimed on social media that Good “viciously ran over the ICE officer” and accused her of being “very disorderly, obstructing and resisting”. He produced a video clip which showed no such thing. Not for the first time, he required Americans to believe him rather than the evidence of their own eyes.\n\nAnd with Minnesota investigators claiming the FBI won’t give them access to the evidence or work with them on the case, we are entering into the cover-up phase of her killing in which conspiracies will substitute for the truth.\n\nThe day before Good’s death, 2,000 ICE agents had been dispatched to Minnesota in what the Trump administration hailed as the largest federal immigration enforcement operation in history.\n\nCritics warned, when Congress increased ICE’s budget by $75bn (£55.9bn) last autumn, that Trump was building a “deportation-industrial complex” flush with cash that would be used against US citizens.\n\nWe are seeing its results now. Good is the first US citizen to die in this conflict, but the ninth person to be shot by immigration officers in the last four months.\n\nThis “war” by masked, armed officers on American soil is taking place while Trump has embarked on regime change and an oil grab in Venezuela and is threatening to invade Greenland. Truly, we have entered a new age of impunity.\n\nWhether it is a turning point is too soon to say. But even the President has noticed the disconnect between his “empire strikes back” fantasies of world domination and unrivalled US prosperity, and his actual standing at home.\n\nHe whined to Republican lawmakers, at the renamed Trump-Kennedy Center in Washington a few days ago, that the popularity of his policies was “weaker than expected”.\n\nThe baffled US President added: “I wish you could explain to me what the hell is going on with the mind of the public because we have the right policy.”\n\nThe White House is currently frantically engaged in a round of “affordability” initiatives – from cheaper US car loans to a possible extension of healthcare subsidies – to counter Trump’s sinking status.\n\nAccording to an Economist/YouGov poll conducted in the first days of January, only 39 per cent of Americans approve of his performance in office compared to with 56 per cent who disapprove, with 36 per cent approving of his handling of the economy (57 per cent disapprove).\n\nTrump’s comment to The New York Times that US involvement in Venezuela could last years and that developing “the oil will take a while” will not ease his woes. Only one in three Americans told a Reuters/Ipsos poll they supported the military strike on Venezuela.\n\nNow the shooting of Good has put the his administration on the back foot just as it was enjoying a propaganda victory in Minnesota – a Midwestern, blue-collar state – after the uncovering of a brazen scam involving pockets of the Somali diaspora.\n\nThis week, Maga collected the scalp of Minnesota governor Tim Walz, Kamala Harris’s underpowered vice-presidential candidate, who announced he would not be seeking re-election after more than $1bn (£745m) was alleged to have been wasted on non-existent social services, including Covid-19 feeding programmes for children.\n\nBut Good’s killing has not only reminded voters of the horrendous murder of Floyd. Jarringly, it occurred at the same time Trump endorsed a new “official” history of the January 6, 2021 riot at the Capitol on the White House website.\n\nAs well as insisting the election was stolen by Joe Biden, the site proclaims that Ashli Babbitt, a 35-year-old Trump supporter who was shot by a policeman breaking into Congress five years ago, as a martyr.\n\nAccording to the White House timeline of events, Babbitt was “fatally shot… without warning as she climbs through a broken window toward the Speaker’s Lobby. No weapon was found on her, and she posed no threat.”\n\nThe smearing of Good and veneration of Babbitt feels like a whole new level of gaslighting from the US President.

Then again, with the same cast of characters in charge, it’s hardly a surprise that it did.\n\nOr that it would keep happening.\n\nWe speak here about the national crisis occasioned by the leadership and citizenry (slightly more than half of it, to be fair) of the state of Minnesota.\n\nSo much has gone wrong there that an entire book can and perhaps should be written — perhaps in multiple volumes. But in the interest of brevity, we’ll limit this national filing of grievance to only five things.\n\nWhich we will endeavor, as best we can, to be quick in declaring.\n\n1. Piracy and Theft\n\nSince before Christmas, the nation has been transfixed by the scandal of Minneapolis’s Somali community and its “economic” activities, which mostly consist of running scams to steal money from the American taxpayer. (RELATED: Minnesota Welfare Scandal Is the Fraud Warning Americans Finally Noticed)\n\nThere can be no real argument at this point that it was a grievous mistake to import hundreds of thousands of people from the world’s worst country. This was sussed out brilliantly in Congressional testimony by Texas Republican Rep. Brandon Gill, who walked a panel of Minnesota state legislators through the litany of failure the Somali community has inflicted on the people of these United States since their arrival…\n\nWhat do you get when you import a community where four in five of its members become dependent on the welfare system? This isn’t a hypothetical question, of course; we already know — and Minnesota has provided us with the answer.\n\nYou get $9 billion in welfare fraud. Because while most Somalis aren’t on the ball enough to do much in the way of productive work, anyone immersed in a slack, openly incontinent system like SNAP or Medicaid will eventually find nooks and crannies in which to hide while draining its coffers. The masterminds of Somali fraud in day care centers, autism “crazy checks” and other things are almost certainly not just Somali — but there are clearly enough Somalis to fill up the fraud pipeline and make it so that any effort to clean these things up is going to be lambasted as “bigoted” or “racist.”\n\nSo you get this…\n\nThis is the type of wholesale racket that Democrats create. The Somalians here are the ones carrying it out, but we should not ignore the role played by their Democratic enablers who created the infrastructure for fraud to proliferate and go unchecked pic.twitter.com/prd3sjIPDS— Dinesh D’Souza (@DineshDSouza) December 24, 2025\n\nHow does the Somali daycare fraud work?– Somalis bring in kids\n– Check them in\n– Leave with the kids\n– Bill the state for care that never happened\n– Parents receive kickbacksOh, and this is surveillance from 2018. This has been happening for YEARS.\npic.twitter.com/MhV9zpTQ5s— Benny Johnson (@bennyjohnson) December 29, 2025\n\nAnd these scams have gone on unabated, outside of the odd prosecution here and there, for more than 15 years, with nobody doing anything effective about it.\n\nNaturally, there is another level to this, which is that when you start asking the old Roman question cui bono — who benefits? — you realize why this unconscionable rape of the American taxpayer has carried on with Minnesota as its locus.\n\nHere’s a hint…\n\nAnd here’s more than a hint…\n\n🚨 HOLY CRAP.

The Heave-Ho\n\nSo as this scandal began to unravel and ferment, the poll numbers began to sour for Minnesota’s governor, Tim Walz — a bizarre, unstable man who was exposed and rejected by voters across the country as Kamala Harris’s servile vice presidential nominee in 2024. Walz was called on the carpet by Minnesota’s senior senator, Amy Klobuchar, the story goes, and told that he’d gone politically septic and could therefore not be his party’s nominee for re-election this fall. (RELATED: Walz Can’t Escape the Somali Fraud Scandal)\n\nWalz seems to have a penchant for deferring to women not named Kristie Noem, so this was the result…\n\nIt was surely an on-brand performance from Walz, who, along with Minnesota’s Attorney General Keith Ellison, actively inflicted the Somali piracy of the welfare state on the American taxpayer and then, when the political price had to be paid for it, went all in on partisan attacks on Donald Trump.\n\nThe parallel that comes to mind is Harvey Weinstein, whose own denouement as a relevant figure on the national stage stemming from the failure of his character was seasoned with political attacks on Trump and a commitment to attack Americans’ gun rights in a failed leftist virtue signal.\n\nWalz’s downfall shouldn’t have been much of a blow to the national Democrat Party; after all, they’d given him his 15 minutes of fame, and he’d used them poorly. Flushing him was probably a net plus.\n\nExcept that the Somali fraud mess is larger than something that can be cleaned up by the political demise of one lackluster governor. It spans several states and billions of dollars; there are political donations on the books to Democrats all around, and it touches something primal in the minds of ordinary Americans.\n\nHeidi Hill, posting at X, summarized this perfectly…\n\nThere is something deeply insulting about watching a Somalian fraud ring siphon billions of dollars from the U.S. government through a scheme so sloppy it should have collapsed before it began.This wasn’t clever. It was incompetent. When confronted, the Somalian actors involved didn’t even deny the fraud outright. They claimed the records—and only the records needed to prosecute them— were stolen. All of them.Seemingly unaware they’d been caught in their own lies, one man bemoaned his innocence while wearing designer sunglasses priced around $2,500. It’s like watching every B movie where the embezzlers go buy a Ferrari and drive it to work the next day.Now activists are rushing in to block all conversation, which to any sane person makes them look even more guilty and increasingly ridiculous. As Frederic Bastiat warned, “When plunder becomes a way of life for a group of men in a society, over the course of time they create for themselves a legal system that authorizes it and a moral code that glorifies it.”\n\nThis mess was metastasizing, and it threatened to engulf an entire political party. Worse, it threatened to demoralize the Democrats’ base of affluent white female leftists — AWFLs — as some or perhaps many would reasonably conclude they’d been had by pirates and fraudsters bilking those beloved social programs.\n\nSomething had to be done. And miraculously, an opportunity arose.\n\n3. A Carpetbagging AWFL Earns Her Immortality\n\nThe public wanted action against the pirates and thieves in Minnesota, and where some of them were not here legally, ICE and the Border Patrol could do at least a modicum of good by sending them home.\n\nMinneapolis is not a focus of ICE activity, but the agency is quite active there. In response, what has happened is that leftist NGO’s, funded partially by American tax dollars, have set up networks on Signal and WhatsApp in order to track the activity of ICE agents and mobilize to stop them from turning arrests into deportations. (RELATED: Please Deliver Us From the Poorly-Behaved Women)\n\nBear in mind that more than 70 percent of everyone deported by ICE through the raids they’re carrying out across the country are not just illegal aliens but either criminals — meaning they’ve committed crimes while here illegally — or they’re under a judicial deportation order. So when ICE rolls in to make an arrest, and someone acts to interfere with their activity, that someone is, in more cases than not, acting to protect a criminal invader into our country. (RELATED: Are They Illegal? Because If They’re Illegal, That’s Why They’re Getting Arrested)\n\nFor some reason — mostly, I imagine, because they’re the base of the Democrat Party and the Left as a whole — the brigades of “activists” mobilizing to stop ICE agents from doing their jobs are chiefly made up of AWFLs.\n\nAnd on Wednesday, a woman named Renee Nicole Good, described as a mother of three and a poet, married to another woman, drove her Honda Pilot into an ICE engagement and parked it in a way that blocked a street so ICE officers couldn’t get out with an arrestee.\n\nGood was asked to move her car. She didn’t. Her lesbian partner got out of the car to film what came next.\n\nThen the ICE officers moved to surround the car and arrest her, because obstruction of a law enforcement activity is a crime.\n\nLet’s remember, because you’ve been propagandized to believe that the recent campaign of left-wing “protests” are “nonviolent,” that there are well-established principles of nonviolent resistance which have come down from Gandhi and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and others, and among those principles are that if you’re going to be arrested by the police for having demonstrated against some unjust thing, you go with them calmly and passively. (RELATED: Abusing Border Patrol Agents: Echoes of Vietnam)\n\nThat’s not what Renee Good did. As an ICE officer approached her open driver’s-side window and another got in front of her vehicle, she first threw the Pilot into reverse and then accelerated forward — perhaps in an attempt to escape, as her supporters have claimed, but the vehicle accelerated directly toward an ICE officer who shot her before being struck by the vehicle and then stepping aside as it careened into a parked car.\n\nThat same ICE officer had been attacked by another leftist protester with a vehicle in June; in that incident, he’d been dragged some distance by the vehicle. Any opprobrium you might have for his having shot Renee Good should be tempered by that knowledge.\n\nAnd as Noem noted, attempting to run ICE officers over with cars is a well-established pattern. A woman behind the wheel of a car is not physically infirm, as she might be attempting to resist an ICE officer on foot, you see, and so if the recruits to your fairly violent “non-violent” resistance are women, you use what you have.\n\nGood was not from Minneapolis. She was born in Colorado and had lived in Kansas City. She showed up in Minneapolis to cause trouble with ICE and had been involved in trying to block streets to prevent ICE officers from doing their jobs several times in the preceding hours and days.\n\nWith three children at home.\n\n4. A Foul Mouth Full of Soy\n\nWith Good’s death, Minnesota’s abjectly evil leftist politicians now had something other than Somali fraud to pivot to, and pivot they did. Jacob Frey, the noxious soyboy mayor of Minneapolis who was himself a carpetbagger — he’s from northern Virginia and has lived in Minneapolis only since 2009 — barely survived re-election against a Somali socialist named Omar Fateh, who might have turned that city into a full-on Mogadishu. Frey needed something to bolster his credibility as a leftist political figure after becoming a laughingstock for his pandering to the Somalis during the campaign, and now he could pander to the AWFLs.\n\nBoy, did he. Here was Frey last week…\n\n‼️ Americans are calling for Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey to resign after he threatened violence against ICE just weeks ago.Now, today, a suspect attempted to run over ICE agents with her vehicle, prompting self-defense gunfire in response. pic.twitter.com/IqkzqE3gaa— Digital Gal (@DigitalGalX) January 7, 2026\n\nThat was not a warning to the Renee Goods of the world that they needed to be careful how far to take their “activism,” by the way. No, it was a demand that ICE not enforce the law.\n\nAnd after Good’s entirely avoidable death — had she exercised some judgment and personal discipline in making one single smart decision on Wednesday, none of this would have happened — this was Frey…\n\nThere is absolutely no defense for the mayor of a city to speak this way — not just because of his foul, unprofessional language but because his message is utterly lawless.\n\nBut it was utterly on brand for the Minneapolis mayor, who had done everything he could to set his city on fire following George Floyd’s death in police custody in May 2020.\n\n5. Insurrection in the Wind\n\nNot to be outdone, and suddenly relevant again with a suitable helping of ghoulish attention-whoring, Walz returned to the political stage with his own announcement. And this was not just the usual demagoguery, but rather something more…\n\n“Peacefully, as you always do.” This from a governor who watched his largest city burn just five and a half years ago.\n\nAnd then Walz threatened to deploy the Minnesota National Guard against the federal government.\n\nThere is almost no precedent for that. It gives off a distinct stench of civil war.\n\nWalz, Frey and the rest of Minnesota’s governing class have encouraged billions of dollars of theft from the American taxpayer, with much of the proceeds remitted to a hostile foreign nation engaged in terrorism and piracy on the high seas, and to deflect from public attention of the resultant scandal, ginned up useful idiots to interfere with federal law enforcement officers while making not-so-veiled threats that violence was coming.\n\nAnd when it did come, they then escalated the conflict with the federal government.\n\nMinnesota is now beyond the pale. It’s a benighted, lawless place.\n\nWere Trump to respond to Walz by invoking the Insurrection Act and deploying the military into the streets of Minnesota’s cities, and perhaps sending special forces operators to pinch Walz as they did Nicolas Maduro last weekend in order to hold him as an accused revolutionary, it would not be an outrageous act.\n\nIt might even be a necessary act.\n\nMinnesota is now leading America into civil war. This would be the stupidest civil war in world history, and that would be beyond doubt on brand for the American Left, which allows itself to be led by people like Walz, Frey, Ellison, and Ilhan Omar. But this is where we are, and it must be dealt with.\n\nWalz and Frey must resign. Now. The full weight of the federal government must descend on Minnesota until they do.\n\nREAD MORE from Scott McKay:\n\nYou’ve Never Heard of the Citgo Six, and We’re Going to Change That Right Now\n\nThe Toppling of Villains Has Begun in Earnest.

Thus, Parks notes, California’s 11% error rate, if not improved, could require the state to “spend about $2 billion annually to maintain CalFresh benefits.”\n\nThe most disturbing item on Parks’ list is the continuing inability of the Employment Development Department to effectively manage unemployment insurance benefits, which first came to light during the COVID-19 pandemic. Billions of dollars in fraudulent benefit claims were approved, almost all of which came in a federally financed expansion of the program.\n\nBy happenstance, the high risk report was released just as a scandal was erupting in Minnesota over widespread fraud in a program meant to keep children fed during the pandemic.\n\nDozens of people, mostly in Minnesota’s substantial Somali population, have been charged with looting the program by setting up companies that billed the state for supplying food that was never delivered.\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz, whom Kamala Harris chose as her running mate in her campaign for president in 2024, felt the political fallout from the scandal — generated mostly in right-leaning media outlets — and this week dropped his bid for re-election.\n\nMeanwhile, those same outlets — blogs, podcasts and YouTube videos — have been making an accusatory connection between the Minnesota scandal and the Parks report, suggesting the report proves the same kind of fraud was even more rampant in California and laying the blame on Gov. Gavin Newsom, who’s a likely 2028 candidate for president.\n\nThis week, Steve Hilton, a Republican candidate for California governor, and Herb Morgan, a Republican running for state controller, cited the Parks report, their own research and tips from whistleblowers in a broad assertion, dubbed “CALIFRAUDIA,” that “California’s exposure to fraud, waste, and abuse across major state programs is likely to reach $250 billion,” adding that it “underscores the urgent need for formal investigation and audit, as a matter of basic fiscal responsibility.”\n\nHowever, the allegations of widespread fraud and mismanagement during Newsom’s governorship is not confined to those on the starboard side of the political balance beam.\n\nKhanna told Politico, “I don’t know what the specific number is” of dollars lost to fraud or mismanagement. “It’s not particular to any person,” Khanna said. “It’s making government more effective. Tackling the mismanagement and waste and some fraud will build more credibility for asking for higher taxes.”\n\nNewsom’s staff responded by accusing Khanna of making a “MAGA made-up claim.”\n\nThere’s a reason why veterans of political wars refer to election years as the “silly season,” when political figures seeking media attention are prone to convert anthills of fact into mountains of rhetorical fantasy.\n\nDan Walters is a CalMatters columnist.","summary":"Critics draw iffy link between Gavin Newsoms record and Minnesotas food fraud scandal","url":"https://www.presstelegram.com/2026/01/07/critics-draw-iffy-link-between-gavin-newsoms-record-and-minnesotas-food-fraud-scandal/","image":"https://www.presstelegram.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Congress_Epstein_19988.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-09 01:01:33","author":"Gqlshare","authors":["Gqlshare"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ie","sentiment":0.033},{"id":392029832,"title":"Liberal journalist recounts time Kamala scolded her over question they laughed about in private","text":"Journalist and podcast host Kara Swisher recounted Monday how Vice President Kamala Harris scolded her in front of an audience over a question about Health and Human Services Secretary (HHS) RFK Jr. that she previously laughed about backstage when the journalist brought it up. \"I just had an experience with Kamala Harris where we were joking about something backstage about Robert Kennedy Jr., circumcision and autism — the link he was making, a link which is not there.

The first question Swisher asked was about her backstage reaction to RFK Jr. connecting \"circumcision and autism.\" \"And she had just laughed about it. And then she went into this sort of high-handed kind of thing where she was like yelling at me for even asking the question. I was like, ‘I’m going to kill you.

And before you ask, no, it doesn't help sidestep the major mismanagement if you're rich.\n\nAnd RedState's Jennifer Van Laar's latest investigative reporting on the 2025 Palisades Fire catastrophe shows that far too many Californians aren't dreamin'; instead, they're living in a nightmare of Newsom's making:\n\nREAD MORE: Newsom's Nightmare: Interim Report Documenting FireAid Fraud Drops on Eve of Palisades Fire Anniversary\n\nWith the turning of the calendar page to January 2026, U-Haul has just released the new Growth Index - and unfortunately for Gov.

Polls have shown broad support for extending the subsidies. A November survey from KFF found most Obamacare marketplace enrollees would blame Trump and congressional Republicans if they expired. Battleground-district surveys from Trump pollster John McLaughlin showed likely voters were less likely to vote for congressional candidates who let them expire. And they also showed the percentage of voters using the credits is higher among those who backed Trump in 2024 than his Democratic rival, Kamala Harris.\n\n“It affects the working-class Trump voters that we need to get Republicans re-elected. In 2025 there was a series of elections where the Trump voters did not come as strongly as they did in 2024,” McLaughlin said Thursday, referencing GOP losses in off-year elections in New Jersey and Virginia and elsewhere. “If you want to get the Trump voters back out, we need to seriously work on a solution where health care becomes more affordable for working class voters.”\n\nThe House bill is dead on arrival in the Senate, where a similar Democratic-led vote failed last year. Instead, Republican senators are hashing out a compromise that would reestablish the enhanced tax credit for two years, not three, along with other rule changes, but the outcome is uncertain.\n\nGOP strategists argued that vulnerable Republicans who voted to restore the subsidies could still get some cover.\n\n“It blunts Democrats’ attack, even though the Democrats are going to use it regardless because it’ll be part of their national messaging,” said Pennsylvania-based GOP consultant Christopher Nicholas.\n\nThe defectors included several moderates who’ve crossed swords with Johnson repeatedly, including Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania and suburban New Yorkers Mike Lawler, Nick LaLota and Andrew Garbarino, who prefer a bipartisan deal over another party-line health care bill.\n\n“This is absolute bullshit,” Lawler said in December about his party’s willingness to let the subsidies expire. Lawler went on to call GOP leaders “idiotic” for refusing an up-or-down vote on the issue.\n\nFitzpatrick broke the dam for Republicans to sidestep the speaker by signing a discharge petition to call up a vote last month. The fifth-term congressman, whose district has roughly 32,000 people on the marketplace, told POLITICO at the time “my people back home care tremendously about this.”\n\nHe was joined in signing the petition by Mackenzie and Bresnahan, who flipped their seats in 2024 by some of the thinnest margins in the country and are now among Democrats’ top targets for 2026. Mackenzie told POLITICO last month that he wanted to extend the subsidies to “help bring down the cost for millions of Americans” as Democrats try to wield affordability messaging as a weapon to erode Republicans’ long-held advantage on the economy in the midterms.\n\nSome Republican strategists have worried that Latinos who swung for Trump in 2024 won’t stay with the party in the midterms. Bresnahan’s swath of Pennsylvania features a large Hispanic population. He previously implored Johnson to not cut SNAP, the food assistance program, or Medicaid, the health insurance program for low-income people, arguing that his Hispanic constituents are “expected to bear the brunt of these reductions.”\n\nKean, in New Jersey, is staring down a crowded field of Democratic rivals that features a physician, Tina Shah, who’s trying to yoke the Republican to the Trump administration’s health care agenda. California’s Valadao, too, is being hammered over health care by his Democratic rivals. He represents large numbers on Medicaid, which Republicans cut funding for in last year’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act.\n\nRepublicans in districts with high numbers of Obamacare enrollees piled onto the Democrats’ bill Thursday.\n\nSalazar’s Miami district is among the highest: nearly 1 in 3, or 230,000, of her constituents are enrolled in Obamacare.\n\nTexas Rep. Monica De La Cruz’s district has more than 140,000 Obamacare enrollees.\n\nNicholas Wu contributed to this report.","url":"https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/08/the-gops-obamacare-defectors-were-more-numerous-than-expected-00718102","image":"https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/44a6da4/2147483647/resize/1200x/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fd6%2Fb9%2F4870e45b45b5be85776dbf79684d%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2174515181","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-09 00:25:00","author":"Lisa Kashinsky","authors":["Lisa Kashinsky"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.374},{"id":392029818,"title":"JD Vance says ‘dumbest’ Democratic candidate will win nomination in 2028","text":"Vice President JD Vance quipped in an exclusive Fox News interview released Wednesday that the \"dumbest\" Democratic frontrunner will likely rise to the top in the upcoming primary. \"Gavin Newsom, obviously, is running for president.

Most say their situation in the United States has worsened. And as Donald Trump’s second term unfolds, Latinos are increasingly critical of his job performance and his administration’s immigration and economic policies – two key issues for Latino voters in last year’s election.\n\n70% of Latinos disapprove of the way Trump is handling his job as president.\n\n65% disapprove of the administration’s approach to immigration.\n\n61% say Trump’s economic policies have made economic conditions worse.\n\nStill, Latinos’ views about Trump and his administration are sharply divided by how they voted in the 2024 election: Those who voted for Trump express strong support for the president and his policies, while those who voted for Kamala Harris hold deeply negative views.\n\nFor instance, 81% of Latino Trump voters approve of the president’s job performance, though this share has declined from 93% at the start of his current term. Meanwhile, nearly all Latino Harris voters disapprove of the president. These patterns mirror those among the general U.S. public.\n\nTrump has introduced major changes in economic and immigration policy since returning to office. On the economy, the administration’s tariff policies and the tax and budget bill known as the “Big Beautiful Bill” are among its signature actions. On immigration, his administration has expanded efforts to detain and deport immigrants living in the country illegally while using more aggressive tactics.\n\nIn the 2024 election, Hispanic voters were among the groups with the largest shifts toward Trump since 2016. Nearly half (48%) backed him in 2024 – up from 36% in 2020 and 28% in 2016.1 \n\nToday, Latinos are the nation’s second largest racial or ethnic group, accounting for one-in-five Americans. They are also among the fastest-growing demographic groups in the United States, making up an increasing share of the country’s population, electorate and labor force.\n\nThis report explores Latinos’ perspectives on their situation in the country today and the second Trump administration. It is primarily based on Pew Research Center’s bilingual National Survey of Latinos, conducted in October 2025 with a nationally representative sample of 4,923 Latino adults.\n\nHow Latinos see their situation in the country\n\nHispanics are pessimistic about their standing in America. About two-thirds (68%) say the situation of U.S. Hispanics today is worse than it was a year ago, while 9% say it’s better and 22% say it’s about the same.\n\nThis is the first time that most Hispanics say their situation has worsened in nearly two decades of Pew Research Center Hispanic surveys.2 When we asked this question in 2019, late during Trump’s first administration, 39% said the situation of U.S. Hispanics had worsened and in 2021, 26% said this.\n\nWhen asked about how the Trump administration’s policies impact Hispanics overall, far more say they harm Hispanics than help them (78% vs. 10%). These views are more critical than in 2019, when 69% said the first Trump administration’s policies were harmful to Hispanics.\n\nAnd on how the Trump presidency shapes their feeling of personal belonging in America, more than half of Latinos (55%) say they have serious concerns about their place in the U.S., up from 48% in 2019.\n\nHow 2024 Latino voters view their place in the U.S.\n\nLatinos who voted for Trump and Harris in 2024 have sharply different assessments on their place in the country.\n\nSituation in the U.S.: 89% of Harris voters say Hispanics’ situation is worse today than a year ago, while 31% of Trump voters say this.\n\nTrump’s impact on Hispanics: 97% of Harris voters say the Trump administration’s policies have been harmful to Hispanics, while 34% of Trump voters say this.\n\nPlace in America under Trump: 64% of Harris voters say they have serious concerns about their place in the U.S. with Trump as president, while 11% of Trump voters say this.\n\nFor more on how Latinos view the president and his impact on Latinos, visit Chapter 1. For more on how they view Latinos’ current and future situation in the country, visit Chapter 2.\n\nHow Hispanics see their personal finances and the economy\n\nU.S. Hispanics saw an increase in median household income and a decrease in their poverty rate between 2023 and 2024.3 Still, majorities of Hispanics rated their financial situation negatively in 2024. And ahead of the presidential election, most were highly concerned about the cost of living and cited the economy as a very important issue to their vote.\n\nThe October 2025 survey finds that most Hispanics continue to view their financial situation negatively. Nearly two-thirds (63%) say their finances are in only fair or poor shape. In contrast, 37% say they’re in excellent or good shape, a slight improvement from last year when 30% gave this rating.\n\nThe survey also finds that roughly one-in-three Latinos have struggled to pay for each of the following in the last year:\n\nFood or groceries (35%)\n\nMedical care (30%)\n\nRent or mortgage (30%)\n\nNotably, about half of Latinos (48%) say they’ve struggled to afford at least one of these three necessities.\n\nAnd Latinos who work full time are just as likely as Latinos who are unemployed to say they’ve struggled to afford food, medical care and housing. \n\nDespite these difficulties, half of Hispanics (50%) expect their and their family’s financial situation to improve over the coming year, nearly the same share who said this in 2024 (51%).\n\nAdditionally, some Latinos have had positive financial experiences in the last year:\n\n36% have been able to save money for the future.\n\n25% have gotten a pay raise at their current job or a better job.\n\nWhen asked about the overall U.S. economy, Hispanics’ views are mostly negative and unchanged from 2024. Some 78% say the economy is in only fair or poor shape, while 22% say it’s in excellent or good shape. In 2024, 76% gave the economy a negative rating. \n\nMany Latinos also have a negative outlook on the economy’s future. About half (49%) say the nation’s economy will worsen over the next year, up substantially from 2024. Another 23% say economic conditions will be about the same as now.\n\nFor more on how Latinos view their personal finances, visit Chapter 3. For more on their views of the nation’s economy, visit Chapter 4.\n\nLatinos’ experiences and views of immigration policy\n\nToday, 44% of Latinos adults are immigrants, numbering 21.1 million, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates of the 2024 American Community Survey.\n\nSince the first day of Donald Trump’s second term, immigration has been a key part of his administration’s agenda, including broader efforts to deport immigrants who are living in the country illegally.\n\nAmid this heightened enforcement, 52% of Latino adults say they worry a lot or some that they, a family member or a close friend could be deported. This is up from 42% in March. Majorities of younger adults, Harris voters, immigrants and those with family origins in Central America now express this worry.\n\nAdditionally, a majority of Latinos (59%) say they have seen or heard of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids or arrests in their community in the past six months.\n\nImmigration enforcement has also impacted Latinos’ daily routines:\n\n19% say they have recently changed their day-to-day activities because they think they’ll be asked to prove their legal status in the country.\n\n11% say they now carry a document proving their U.S. citizenship or immigration status more often than they normally would.\n\nLatinos are increasingly critical of the administration’s approach to deportations. About seven-in-ten (71%) say it is doing too much when it comes to deporting immigrants living in the country illegally, up from 56% in March.\n\nIn 2023, the vast majority of Latino adults in the U.S. (82%) had full legal status as U.S.-born citizens, immigrants with naturalized citizenship, or lawful immigrants without citizenship, according to Pew Research Center estimates. Meanwhile, 18% of Latino adults were unauthorized immigrants, a group that includes those without full legal status.4\n\nFor more on how Latinos view the Trump administration’s immigration policy, visit Chapter 5.

The fraud cases led Minnesota’s Democratic governor, Tim Walz — former Vice President Kamala Harris’ 2024 running mate — to announce this week he will not run for reelection.\n\nIn June, a Democratic state lawmaker and her husband were assassinated by a Trump supporter, although conservatives insist the gunman was actually a leftist working at Walz’s behest. On Sunday, the victims’ family begged Trump to take down a social media post echoing those conspiracy theories.\n\nMemories of the chaos that followed the killing of George Floyd\n\nAmid that mounting tension, the Trump administration announced Tuesday that it was sending more than 2,000 federal officers to the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul in what it claimed would be the biggest immigration enforcement operation in history.\n\nThe Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer who killed Renee Good during a protest Wednesday against the immigration raids opened fire just blocks from where, in 2020, a Minneapolis police officer killed George Floyd. The parallels were painful and frightening for many in the area, including Stephanie Abel, a 56-year-old Minneapolis nurse, who is keeping her gas tank full and cash handy in memory of the chaos that followed that slaying.\n\n“I thought the federal government would realize that now is not the time to be toying with people,” Abel said. “What are they going to try to do to get Minneapolis to ignite?”\n\nFloyd’s death sparked the biggest protests of Trump’s first term. The president, who is still publicly bitter about the unrest, contends it should have been met with a stronger show of force.\n\nThat’s the approach Trump has adopted in his second term, trying to cow blue states by surging military and immigration agents into their cities and insisting that anyone who doesn’t comply with federal demands will face severe consequences.\n\nImmigration operations that started last summer in liberal strongholds such as Chicago,Los Angeles and Portland also generated large protests. Good is at least the fifth person killed during ICE enforcement efforts.\n\nOn Thursday, Vice President JD Vance said Good’s death was “a tragedy of her own making,” blamed “leftist ideology” and said the media had encouraged protests against Trump’s immigration crackdown.\n\nFederal investigators have Somalis in their sights\n\nThe Twin Cities operation is intertwined with a conservative effort to make Minnesota the poster child for government fraud. Though prosecutions for the fraudulent use of hundreds of millions of dollars of federal COVID-19 and health aid by social service groups began in the Biden administration, Trump and conservatives have seized on the scandal in recent weeks.\n\nIn November, Trump called Minnesota “a hub of fraudulent money laundering activity” after a report by a conservative news site, City Journal, claimed federal money was fraudulently flowing to the militant group al-Shabab. There has been little, if any, evidence, proving such a link. Nevertheless, the president said he would end Temporary Protected Status for Somalis in Minnesota.\n\nThe allegations got a new charge late last month when conservative influencer Nick Shirley posted an unconfirmed video claiming that day care centers in Minneapolis run by Somalis had fraudulently collected over $100 million in government aid.\n\nJamal Osman, a Somali immigrant and Minneapolis city councilman who lives just a few blocks from the location of the ICE shooting, said he and other prominent Somalis in the area have been swamped with angry calls and messages since Trump made his statements. The vitriol, he said, mainly comes from out of state.\n\n“We have whole groups of people who’ve never been to Minnesota,” Osman said in an interview. “Minnesota is probably one of the nicest places to live. It’s a beautiful area with very nice people and we blended in, it’s all very nice. We don’t really see bad things happening here normally.”\n\nThe Trump administration on Tuesday said is withholding funding for programs that support needy families with children, including day care funding, in five Democratic-led states over concerns about fraud. Joining Minnesota on the list were California, Colorado, Illinois and New York.\n\n‘Leave our state alone’\n\nMinnesota’s place on a list of targeted blue states is not unexpected.\n\nUnder Walz, Minnesota has become something of a beacon for liberals as an example of a state that expanded the public safety net even as the nation swung to the right. Since Trump’s first election, the state has seen large increases in education spending, free school breakfasts and lunches, and improved protection of abortion rights.\n\nTrump lost Minnesota by only 4 percentage points in 2024, making it significantly less liberal than California and New York. Still, it has been reliably Democratic throughout the Trump years, a rarity in the swingy upper Midwest.\n\nThe state’s political tilt reflects the size of the Twin Cities metro area and its robust population of college-educated liberals, which overwhelm the state’s more conservative rural reaches.\n\nIt’s the sort of cleavage that has defined national politics during Trump’s years in office.\n\n“Minnesota is a microcosm of a lot of the tensions we have in our society,” said David Schultz, a political scientist at Hamline University in St. Paul. “We’re a country that’s hugely polarized, Democrats-Republicans, urban-rural.”\n\nOn Thursday, Minnesota was an ominous indicator of the damage those divisions can inflict. Minneapolis schools remained closed after immigration agents clashed with high school students at one campus on Wednesday. The state’s National Guard remained on standby at Walz’s directive.\n\nWalz begged Trump to ease up, saying Minnesota’s residents are “exhausted” by the president’s “relentless assault on Minnesota.”\n\n“So please, just give us a break,” Walz said during a news conference Thursday. “And if it’s me, you’re already getting what you want, but leave my people alone. Leave our state alone.”\n\nRiccardi reported from Denver. Associated Press reporters Giovanna Dell’Orto, Rebecca Santana and Tim Sullivan in Minneapolis contributed.","summary":"In June, a Democratic state lawmaker and her husband were assassinated by a Trump supporter, although conservatives blame Tim Walz.","url":"https://fortune.com/2026/01/08/why-is-minnesota-the-target-trump-ice-george-floyd-somalia/","image":"https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26008550504580.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-08 23:03:00","author":"Nicholas Riccardi,Steve Karnowski,The Associated Press","authors":["Nicholas Riccardi","Steve Karnowski","The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.192},{"id":392134236,"title":"Spencer Pratt’s GOP registration poses early test in LA mayor’s race","text":"“It’s a nonpartisan race,” he said.\n\nLA’s mayoral election is nonpartisan, but the city is deep blue. Of the city’s 2.2 million registered voters as of October, 55 percent are Democrats and just 15 percent are Republican, with 23 percent registered no party preference.\n\nNo Republicans serve on the 15-member city council and all but one are Democrats. Bass and her allies blasted the registration history of her opponent in the 2022 election, billionaire developer Rick Caruso, who was a registered Republican and independent before becoming a Democrat shortly before entering the mayoral race. The city hasn’t had a Republican mayor since Richard Riordan left office in 2001. The last four — Bass, Eric Garcetti, Antonio Villaraigosa and James Hahn — were Democrats.\n\nLos Angeles County voter records obtained by POLITICO show that Pratt registered as an independent in July 2008 and re-registered as a Republican in August 2020. He voted in the 2008 general election but did not again in the county until 2020, the records show. He’s voted in every general election since, and voted in last November’s special election on the Proposition 50 redistricting campaign.\n\nNeither Pratt nor a representative responded to requests for comment from POLITICO Thursday. Two hours after POLITICO sent Pratt a direct message on X asking for comment on the voter records, Pratt posted about the issue on the platform.\n\n“I’ve been in the public eye most of my life and there isn’t any dirt you can find on me that hasn’t already been aired,” Pratt wrote. “Seems like the only thing people don’t know is my voter registration, so here go: I registered Republican in 2020 and never changed it. And I wasn’t going to change it now just to check a different box. This is a non-partisan race — there will be no D or R next to my name. As Mayor, I will not serve either party. I will work with anyone who wants to help the City. No labels necessary.”\n\nAs he gained attention over the past year for his tirades on the post-fire rebuild, Pratt sidestepped questions about his party affiliation. He told the Hollywood Reporter in October that his fight is not partisan, noting that most voters in the Palisades supported Kamala Harris in the last presidential election.\n\n“If Newsom and Bass were Republicans, I’d be doing the exact same thing: spitting facts,” Pratt said.\n\nNevertheless, his wildfire activism and constant attacks on a likely 2028 Democratic presidential contender has attracted interest and support from GOP and Trump administration figures.\n\nSen. Rick Scott, a Republican from Florida, is leading a congressional investigation into the Palisades fire spurred by Pratt’s work. After Pratt made his mayoral announcement Wednesday, Scott posted his support on X.\n\nEndorsements also came from Richard Grenell, a Trump special envoy, right-wing influencer Benny Johnson and both leading Republican candidates for governor, Riverside Sheriff Chad Bianco and Fox News contributor Steve Hilton.","url":"https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/08/yes-spencer-pratt-is-a-republican-00716927","image":"https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/0617347/2147483647/resize/1200x/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F64%2Fff%2Fab10c0d248958e85a1372bc224d4%2Fcongress-california-wildfires-29882.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-08 22:25:00","author":"Liam Dillon","authors":["Liam Dillon"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.26},{"id":392024662,"title":"Sen. Susan Collins breaks with Trump over Venezuela, reasserting War Powers Act","text":"Sen. Susan Collins voted in support of a resolution Thursday reaffirming the need for congressional approval for any future military action in Venezuela.\n\nCollins was one of five Republicans to join Democrats and support advancing the war powers resolution from Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Virginia, on a 52-47 vote and ensure a vote next week on final passage. It was a rare rebuke of President Donald Trump during his second term. \n\nSen. Angus King, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, also voted in favor of the measure, which failed to gain the support of a veto-proof two-thirds majority.\n\nCollins’ vote represents a high-profile break with Senate Republicans and with Trump, who told The New York Times in an interview Wednesday that the U.S. could oversee operations and control oil reserves in Venezuela for years.\n\nTrump took to social media to blast Collins and other Republican defectors for their “stupidity,” saying they “should never be elected to office again.”\n\nCollins is seeking her sixth term in November. Her seat is viewed as a prime pick-up opportunity for Democrats because of Collins’ low approval ratings. She’s also the only New England Republican in Congress, and the only Republican senator up for reelection in a state won by Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. \n\n“Republicans should be ashamed of the senators that just voted with Democrats in attempting to take away our powers to fight and defend the United States of America,” Trump said. \n\nHer vote is also a change in position. Collins voted against a bill last year that would have required Trump to seek congressional approval prior to any military action. A spokesperson said at the time that her opposition stemmed from vague language in the bill. \n\nCollins said in a recent written statement that she supported Saturday’s successful mission to capture Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife. She said Maduro is a “narco-terrorist and international drug trafficker” who “held power through stolen elections and horrific violence against the people of Venezuela.”\n\n“With Maduro rightfully captured, the circumstances have now changed,” Collins said. “While I support the operation to seize Nicolás Maduro, which was extraordinary in its precision and complexity, I do not support committing additional U.S. forces or entering into any long-term military involvement in Venezuela or Greenland without specific congressional authorization.”\n\nCollins noted that the resolution doesn’t affect the original removal operation. Instead, it would reaffirm the need for Trump to seek congressional approval for future military action, while leaving enough room for the president to defend the U.S. from an attack or imminent threat.\n\n“I believe invoking the War Powers Act at this moment is necessary, given the president’s comments about the possibility of ‘boots on the ground’ and a sustained engagement ‘running’ Venezuela, with which I do not agree,” Collins said. \n\n“What happens now matters greatly — both in terms of accountability for Maduro and the future of the Venezuelan people. The long-term success of this operation will depend on Venezuelans having the opportunity to run Venezuela, with the support of international and private sector partners.”\n\nKing lauded the resolution’s advance in the Senate in an interview with the Press Herald. He said a confidential briefing with Secretary of State Marco Rubio yesterday raised “more questions than answers.” He also questioned Trump’s subsequent comments suggesting a yearslong commitment in Venezuela and possible action against Greenland.\n\n“Clearly that kind of intervention in another country should have some authorization from Congress,” King said. “The resolution today passed, which has not happened in the past. And I think that suggests that the Republicans are starting to also raise concerns.”\n\nKing said the shifting rationale and the lack of a clear plan suggest that the Maduro operation was a pretext for taking over the Venezuelan oil industry. He worries the administration raising national security concerns about Greenland would be a similar pretext for natural resource extraction.\n\n“We can have national security assets in place without owning the country,” King said. “This national security argument is nonsense. It’s so clearly meaningless that it makes me think that there is, in fact, some ulterior motive, and it’s perhaps natural resources.”\n\nGov. Janet Mills, who is running in a Democratic primary to take on Collins this fall, criticized Maine’s senior senator for opposing last year’s bill only to now lend her support to the latest resolution.\n\n“Once again, she is a day late and a dollar short,” Mills said in a written statement. “Susan Collins had the chance to stand up to Donald Trump and reassert congressional authority months ago, but instead she refused, giving him the greenlight to unilaterally move us towards war in Venezuela.”\n\nMills had previously called on Collins to use her power as chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee to hold public hearings to press the administration about its future plans in the region and add language to budget bills to prevent tax dollars from funding operations in Venezuela.\n\nCollins dismissed those ideas, saying senators needed to focus on passing budget bills to avoid another government shutdown at the end of the month.\n\n“My problem with Susan Collins is that she never does the right or hard thing the first time when it’s needed most — only when it serves her politically — and we always pay the price,” Mills said. \n\nEditor’s note: This story was updated Thursday to reflect that the War Powers Act resolution still needs final approval in the Senate next week.","summary":"Maine's senior senator was 1 of 5 Republicans who helped advance the Senate resolution in a rare rebuke of the president.

Vance also pushed back on the notion that the Trump administration bears responsibility for the \"cost-of-living crisis,\" arguing that it has already taken significant steps to lower costs and reverse Biden-era policies, with more efforts underway.\n\nHe argued that “the dumbest candidate,” between California Governor Gavin Newsom and former Vice President Kamala Harris, is likely to win the nomination. \n\n“I mean, look, the Democrats have a couple of big issues,” Vance said. “One is that they lean so far into wokeism that they can’t see the obviousness of the fact, which is that Kamala Harris is not qualified to be president of the United States. That’s why she got the vice presidential nomination [in 2020]. That’s why she got the presidential nomination [in 2024]. This is who Kamala Harris is.\"\n\n“Now, the flip side is, I think you have an unbelievably corrupt and incompetent governor in Gavin Newsom,” Vance continued. “The fact that those are the two front-runners just suggests how deeply deranged the Democrat Party is.

So if they ever get power, are they going to, you know, lower Americans’ taxes? No. Are they going to make your life more affordable? No. Are they going to solve the crime crisis? No.\"\n\n“What they’re going to do is they’re going to spend all of their time and all of your money trying to get Donald Trump,” he added. “I think it’s ridiculous. I think it’s ridiculous that’s what they’re running on. But the American people are going to make this determination. I think the American people should vote for the people who want to make their life more affordable and want to make their neighborhoods safer. That’s what we’re trying to deliver every single day.”\n\nThe vice president was then asked for his thoughts on the Democrats' focus on affordability and whether or not it could be a winning issue for them.\n\n“No, I’m not worried about that for the simple reason that the cost-of-living crisis, and it is real for a lot of American families, was caused by the Democrats,” Vance said. “We haven’t even been in office for a year and you’ve already seen prices start to come down.

Subscribe to our YouTube channel to see more of his videos.\n\nThis content was recorded by Victor Davis Hanson prior to his Dec. 30 medical operation.\n\nHello, this is Victor Davis Hanson for The Daily Signal. I wanna return to the Jan. 6 demonstration that turned into a riot. Everything that we’ve been told by that narrative from the Left seems inaccurate. They told us it was an organized insurrection. They used the word insurrection.\n\nRemember, in the second impeachment, indictment of Donald Trump, and the trial, remember, was held after he left office and he was acquitted by the Senate, but the word was insurrection. And we know that special counsel Jack Smith wanted to use that term, insurrection, but he felt that since no one had been charged with insurrection for a hundred years, he dare not do it.\n\nBut we were told that it was a pre-planned armed takeover, a coup, but there was always something wrong about the left-wing narrative of Jan. 6 because we knew there was a massive demonstration. We knew it turned violent outside. And we knew that people were sort of invited in maybe because they, the guards inside the Rotunda and the Capitol, had no other alternative.\n\nBut everything after that was too clear-cut. The Democrats had the Jan. 6 committee, and then we know that some of the tapes and testimonies were not kept safely, they’re not accessible. Now, some of the witnesses were kind of berated. Then we also learned that Speaker Kevin McCarthy’s nominations were not accepted for the first time in House history.\n\nAnd the only way you could get on the committee, if you were Republican, were if you either had no political future, like Adam Kinzinger, or you were doomed to defeat in your next election, like Liz Cheney.\n\nSo, there was something weird about—now we’re hearing more weird things. They just arrested the so-called pipe bomber, and this was very strange because we were told by the Biden Justice Department they didn’t know who he was, there was no information, but he was probably a, you know, a participant in the right-wing terrorist activities that day. So, it was to their political advantage, apparently, not to really pursue the investigation.\n\nA new administration comes in and they just start tracing the cellphone imprint of various people and they look at their sales records where they bought this particular item in the pipe bomb, and they came up with a Brian Cole Jr.\n\nHe’s a young African American man from a middle-class family. He says he’s an anarchist. Initial reports seem to suggest he was on the left and had empathies with Black Lives Matter and Antifa, but the evidence is so fragmentary, we’re not sure. He had four hours of testimony in which he purportedly today confessed. And now he says he thought Trump was robbed of the election.\n\nSo, we don’t know exactly what his empathies were, but it was, apparently, incumbent upon the Biden administration not to investigate who this pipe bomber was and to leave it out there as if he was a part of a violent resistance. And that is consistent with the misinformation that we had and the fake news about the entire day.\n\nRemember, Kamala Harris, when running for president, she said Jan. 6 is the same thing, it rests with, it’s parallel to, it’s comparable to Pearl Harbor, 2,400 dead, or 9/11, 3,000 people dead. And of course, how many people died? Well, we know five people died, but how many people died violently? That’s the key.\n\nThe key thing to remember, that the violent deaths were one, maybe two—a Trump protester that was caught in the scramble and the pressure between the crowd and the police. but really one, Ashli Babbitt, a 14-year veteran who was unarmed and was committing a misdemeanor of entering a broken window.\n\nShe was shot by Officer Byrd lethally, and then, all of a sudden, we never really knew who Officer Byrd was, we were told it was a justified shooting. We never learned that he had a checkered record, that he was, you know, clumsy, lazy with his gun, that he was—had left it and people had found it in a Capitol restroom.\n\nSo, they wanted to suppress the information and suggest that she was an insurgent. That was complete misinformation. Then we were told there wasn’t really any FBI informants, and then-FBI Director Christopher Wray said he didn’t know. And only with a change of administrations did FBI records come out that there was probably somewhere between 250 and 275 actual FBI agents or informants in the crowd.\n\nAnd remember that Matthew Rosenberg, the Pulitzer Prize reporter for The New York Times, had told us at the time, in an ambush interview by Project Veritas, when he nonchalantly was talking to someone he didn’t know was associated with Operation Veritas, he said there was a ton of informants there and he knew them.\n\nAnd then, of course, Donald Trump said assemble peacefully and patriotically to the Capitol. Not like Kamala Harris, who, in the year before, 2020, had told people that the George Floyd riots should not stop, they will not stop. She called them demonstrations, but they were riots. And she said nor should they stop, they’re gonna go onto the election.\n\nAdd it all up, and the latest revelations that there is a pipe bomber and he was angry at the Democrats because he left something at the Democratic Party, a Republican, we don’t know. We don’t know whether his anarchist sympathies mean he is on the left. It’s very improbable to think that they would be on the right, even though he thinks Donald Trump got robbed of the elections.\n\nBut maybe he wants to pose as a right-wing person and confirm the predestined narrative that this man must be a right-wing, violent person, and he thinks maybe the Left will be go easy on him, or maybe he thinks that Donald Trump will pardon him. I don’t know. But the whole thing is mysterious.\n\nAnd to sum up everything we’ve been told about Jan. 6 from the congressional committee to Kamala Harris’ description of it, to comparisons with the four-month, $2 billion, 35 dead, 1,500 police officers, prior riots, arson attacks on courthouses, police precincts that was never really mentioned as a comparable crisis in the republic, all of these things, a number of FBI informants, a number of FBI agents, any effort to find the pipe bomber, the treatment of the January—it was all never transparent. We never got the honest story.\n\nSo, that begs the question, why? Why didn’t they just come out and say, “Here’s all the information”?\n\nAnd the reason is, they wanted to cement a narrative in everybody’s mind that a reckless demonstration that turned into a riot was a pre-planned insurrection by Donald Trump, who ordered it, and therefore, should forfeit his political career, and he should never be allowed to run for office. And they impeached him and they wanted that narrative to stick. And it was a complete fabrication.\n\nThere was a demonstration, there was a riot. It was wrong. But everything else was a Democratic narrative, as we’re seeing most recently with a strange case of Brian Cole that suddenly, suddenly, after four years of Biden DOJ in action, within 10 months, the Trump FBI found out who he was, and that he confessed to that crime of leaving pipe bombs at the DNC in the RNC headquarters.\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

Gabby Giffords returns to House floor on 15th anniversary of shooting","text":"By JONATHAN J. COOPER, Associated Press\n\nPHOENIX (AP) — Former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords returned to the House floor Thursday on the 15th anniversary of the assassination attempt that cut short her promising political career and shocked a nation that has only seen political violence worsen in the years since.\n\nGiffords held hands with her husband, Sen. Mark Kelly, as House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries lauded her congressional service and her advocacy for tougher gun control measures. She received a standing ovation from a few dozen lawmakers in the chamber, most of them fellow Democrats.\n\n“House Democrats stand with Gabby and with all Americans who say ‘enough is enough,’” said Jeffries, who pledged that Democrats would prioritize gun control legislation if they win the House majority in November’s midterm elections.\n\nGiffords was shot in the head on Jan. 8, 2011, while meeting with constituents at a grocery store in Tucson, Arizona. Six were killed and 12 injured in addition to Giffords, who was left with limited motion on one side and aphasia, a verbal disability.\n\nNo coherent motive has been established for the shooter, Jared Loughner, who had schizophrenia and shared a variety of disjointed, nonsensical conspiracies in his online posts. He was sentenced to life in prison after being forcibly medicated to make him competent to stand trial.\n\nThe targeting of a political event foreshadowed the rising tide of violence that has shadowed American democracy. There was the U.S. Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021, two attempts on Donald Trump’s life, and the killing last June of a Minnesota lawmaker and her husband.\n\nMore recently, conservative activist Charlie Kirk was assassinated while talking to college students.\n\nGiffords left Congress after the shooting to focus on her recovery, cutting short a political career that many in Arizona believe would have included a run for governor or U.S. Senate.\n\nShe went on to create, along with Kelly, a political group—now known as GIFFORDS—that lobbies for tougher gun laws and works to elect state and federal lawmakers who will support them.\n\nKelly was elected to the Senate in 2020 and was a finalist to be Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate in the 2024 presidential election.","summary":"Giffords left Congress after the shooting to focus on her recovery.","url":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2026/01/08/congress-giffords/","image":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/House_Giffords_98606.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-08 20:53:24","author":"Associated Press,Gqlshare","authors":["Associated Press","Gqlshare"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.103},{"id":392024668,"title":"Trump: Susan Collins ‘should never be elected to office again’","text":"President Donald Trump on Thursday blasted Sen. Susan Collins and four other Republicans who joined Democrats to reaffirm the need for congressional approval for further military action in Venezuela. \n\nThe Senate advanced the war powers resolution on a 52-47 vote, ensuring a vote next week on final passage of the resolution and handing Trump a rare rebuke from his own party in his second term.\n\nTrump, who will likely veto the resolution from Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Virginia, condemned the defectors for their “stupidity,” saying they “should never be elected to office again.”\n\n“Republicans should be ashamed of the senators that just voted with Democrats in attempting to take away our powers to fight and defend the United States of America,” Trump said in a social media post.\n\nIn response to Trump, Collins spokesperson Blake Kernen explained Collins’ rationale for voting for the resolution.\n\n“It’s clear the president is frustrated about today’s vote. While Senator Collins supported the operation to seize Nicolás Maduro, she has a serious disagreement with the administration over the possibility of committing additional U.S. forces or entering into any long-term military involvement in Venezuela or Greenland without specific congressional authorization,” Kernen wrote in a statement.\n\nThe other Senate Republicans called out by Trump for supporting the resolution were Lisa Murkowski of Alaska; Rand Paul of Kentucky; Josh Hawley of Missouri and Todd Young of Indiana.\n\nThe criticism comes as Collins is locked in a tough reelection battle. She’s the only Republican senator running in a state won by Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election and the only New England Republican left in Congress.\n\nHarris won statewide and in the more liberal 1st Congressional District, while Trump won in the more rural, conservative 2nd Congressional District. Maine is one of two states that splits electoral votes, so Harris received three votes and Trump got one.\n\nThe leading Democrats vying to take on Collins are two-term incumbent Gov. Janet Mills and Graham Platner, a combat veteran and oyster farmer whose campaign has been backed by national progressives like Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont.\n\nBoth Platner and Mills have slammed Collins for voting against a bill last year that would have limited Trump’s ability to take military action in Venezuela. \n\nMills has also criticized Collins’ personal oil investments and called on her to use her power as chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee to hold hearings to get answers from the administration. Mills also wants Collins to add language to budget bills preventing tax dollars from being used in Venezuela.\n\nCollins dismissed Mills’ suggestions, saying senators are focused on advancing budget bills to avoid another government shutdown at the end of the month.\n\nThe criticism from both sides highlights the delicate balance Collins is trying strike while seeking her sixth term in office. \n\nCollins has a complicated relationship with Trump, who has maintained a tight grip on the Republican party. She hasn’t supported any of his campaigns for president and voted to impeach him after the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riots. She has at times enabled his agenda, while also leaving enough room to criticize his actions.\n\nOver the summer, Collins provided a key vote to advance Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a measure that cut taxes — largely for the wealthy — and also cut nearly a trillion dollars from Medicaid.\n\nCollins ultimately voted against the package, even though she helped secure $50 billion in funding for rural hospitals to help make up for the Medicaid cuts. Her vote resulted in a 50-50 tie that was broken by Vice President JD Vance.\n\nTrump let Collins slide that time. But that detente ended in August when Collins opposed the administration’s proposal to claw back spending previously approved by Congress. \n\n“Republicans, when in doubt, vote the exact opposite of Senator Susan Collins,” Trump said in a social media post. “Generally speaking, you can’t go wrong. Thank you for your attention to this matter and, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”\n\nTrump also criticized Collins in 2022 for reportedly working with Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, to recruit “anti-Trump candidates.” Trump called Collins “absolutely atrocious” and said he could have ousted her from her Senate seat.\n\nA month later, Trump called Collins “wacky” for leading efforts to make it harder for members of Congress to challenge election results. Collins wanted to make it clear that the vice president only has a ceremonial role in counting electoral votes. The changes were made after Trump pressured former Vice President Mike Pence to overturn the 2020 election results.\n\nEditor’s note: This story was updated Thursday to reflect that the War Powers Act resolution still needs final approval in the Senate next week.","summary":"The criticism comes amid a tough reelection battle for Collins.","url":"https://www.centralmaine.com/2026/01/08/trump-susan-collins-should-never-be-elected-to-office-again/","image":"https://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/Trump_96589_bf5d71.jpg?w=780","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-08 20:46:47","author":"Randy Billings","authors":["Randy Billings"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.049},{"id":392047504,"title":"How the Right-Wing Outrage Machine Prompted the Conflagration in Minnesota","text":"More than 2,000 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents are on the ground in Minnesota in what President Donald Trump’s administration officials have called the “largest immigration operation ever.” Deployed just days ago by Trump, one agent has already shot and killed a person and federal law enforcement has deployed tear gas and pepper spray against protesters.\n\nThe massive operation and subsequent violence in Minneapolis comes against the backdrop of Trump’s announcement Tuesday that he’s freezing $10 billion in federal funds approved by Congress for child welfare programs, including Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, foster care, and childcare subsidies in Minnesota and four other blue states. \n\nThis sharp escalation in action has its roots in a yearslong law enforcement investigation into widespread fraud and misuse of federal funds in Minnesota that in late 2025 was seized upon by the right-wing misinformation machine and, this week, reached a screeching fever pitch. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz announced Monday he would not be running for reelection, in part so he could devote his time to addressing the crisis. \n\nThe journey from legitimate local and federal investigations into fraud to the so-called largest ICE operation in history, the pausing of federal funds to blue states and the end of Walz’s gubernatorial tenure is a long and tangled one. As has become common in the Trump era, a serious situation was dispersed throughout the unserious realm of right-wing media and content creation, catching the attention of the president and yielding very real consequences. \n\nHere’s the backstory you need to understand these events.\n\nHow the Scandals Started\n\nAmid the right-wing uproar, there are elements of truth: Minnesota has grappled with Medicaid fraud for more than a decade, which has been the focus of federal and state investigations and local news reporting. The schemes were further fueled by the COVID-19 pandemic, during which an influx of federal funding for social programs came with relaxed vetting standards in an effort to allow speedy access for vulnerable populations. \n\nRepublican furor over widespread fraud has also flared up periodically over the years. But it reached new heights in recent months after a wave of new claims — ranging from the well-founded to the baseless to the entirely histrionic — caught the attention of the president. \n\nSome of the first claims of fraud arose in 2015, and focused on day care centers that local authorities accused of overbilling state welfare agencies. This gave rise to an early instance of right-wing outrage, when a local Fox affiliate in 2018 speculated that hundreds of millions of dollars were being stolen from the program and sent to terrorists in Africa. State officials found that claim to be baseless. \n\nIn 2021, feds began investigating fraud claims connected to a child nutrition program. By early 2022, the FBI seized property from a nonprofit called “Feeding Our Future.” The revelation of the investigation prompted bipartisan outrage toward the fraudsters; Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN), for example, questioned the U.S. Department of Agriculture about the misuse of funds, asking about the investigation and steps that could be taken to prevent “fraudulent misuse of federal funding meant to feed hungry children” in the future. \n\nIn September 2022, the Department of Justice announced federal criminal charges against a network of people connected to Feeding Our Future, alleging they defrauded the government of $250 million in federal child nutrition funding, using the funds instead for mansions, cars and other lavish personal expenses. Former Attorney General Merrick Garland said the indictments represented “the largest pandemic relief fraud scheme” to date. At the time, 47 people were indicted, many, but not all of whom, were members of the Minnesota Somali community. State Republicans began pointing a finger at the governor.\n\nThe scandal continued to unfold. Even the ensuing criminal proceedings were rife with corruption, with one juror dismissed after fraud defendants tried to bribe the juror with a literal bag of cash. The Feeding Our Future scheme has proven vast and deep. Between 2023 and 2025, more indictments came down connected to the case, with the 78th person indicted this past November. It has become the poster child for Minnesota’s tangled fraud network that has so far extended to autism services, Medicaid fraud, addiction services and housing..\n\nThe state has also investigated the network. In August 2023, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison charged 18 people with defrauding Medicaid of $9.5 million with fake home health care businesses. Ellison in December 2023 announced charges in what his office called the largest Medicaid fraud case it had investigated. Three people were charged in an $11 million prosecution. A June 2024 state audit found the Minnesota Department of Education had received dozens of complaints about the nonprofit and failed to oversee the distribution of the $250 million at the heart of the case.\n\nThe Politics of the Scandals\n\nState Republicans continued to use the fraud investigations and indictments as evidence of Walz’s unfit leadership. When Walz became Kamala Harris’s vice presidential candidate in August 2024, the governor became a punching bag for Republicans in the state running for local and national office. On the Hill, House Republicans subpoenaed Walz for information about his actions and responsibilities related to the Feeding Our Future scheme.\n\nIn September 2025, eight people were charged in a multi-million dollar housing fraud scheme for a state program that used Medicaid funds for certain housing services. Then-Acting U.S. Attorney for the District of Minnesota Joseph Thompson called the indictments “the first wave of charges in a massive fraud” program. The abused housing program was dissolved in late October. \n\nIn addition to the political advantages of blaming the Democratic governor, some conservatives exploited the fact that most of the people implicated in each of the fraud investigations were members of Minnesota’s Somali community. That became paramount when Trump and prominent members of the MAGA-sphere got involved. \n\nTrump Grabs the Story\n\nOn Nov. 19, City Journal, a publication produced by the conservative New York think tank The Manhattan Institute published a post co-authored by Chris Rufo, the notorious anti-woke crusader who is also a fellow at the think tank. The report alleged Minnesota fraudsters were wiring their spoils to a Somalia-based terrorism organization called Al-Shabaab, citing “federal counterterrorism sources.” Two days later, news website and television station The National News Desk — owned by the conservative Sinclair Broadcast group — covered the City Journal report. Those posts may have been what caught the president’s eye. Two hours after The National News Desk report was published, Trump posted about the Minnesota fraud investigations on Truth Social. “Minnesota, under Governor Waltz, is a hub of fraudulent money laundering activity,” Trump wrote, misspelling the governor’s name. In the same post, he said he was removing a special immigration status that covers about 700 Somalian people in the U.S., and introduced the idea that “Somali gangs are terrorizing” Minnesotans.\n\nThe Truth Social posts marked the beginning of a far-right frenzy that has seen the president and extremist influencers feed off of one another, spinning narratives and pushing policies pulsating with outrage, xenophobia and Islamophobia. On Nov. 29, the New York Times echoed Republican talking points blaming the Somali community for federal funds theft, saying that the “fraud took root in pockets of Minnesota’s Somali diaspora as scores of individuals made small fortunes.” On Dec. 1, the White House issued a one-pager about the Minnesota situation, repeatedly highlighting the ethnicity of most of the people who had been federally charged and blaming Walz.\n\nTrump on Dec. 2 deployed a first round of ICE agents — about 100 — to Minneapolis and St. Paul to target the Somali community, an official told the New York Times. All the while, legitimate federal investigations continued to play out.\n\nProsecutor Thompson is now the First Assistant U.S. Attorney for the District of Minnesota. Appointed by Trump, Thompson has served as a longtime prosecutor. On Dec. 18, he charged five new people in the housing program Medicaid fraud scheme. Thompson said more than $9 billion in federal funds may have been stolen from Minnesota. \n\n“The magnitude cannot be overstated,” Thompson said. “What we see in Minnesota is not a handful of bad actors committing crimes. It’s staggering, industrial-scale fraud.”\n\nFollowing this announcement, the total number of people indicted in Minnesota fraud schemes reached 92. Eighty-two of those were of Somali descent, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for Minnesota, PBS reported. While a significant share of the scammers are Somali, the number is less than 0.1% of the entire Somali population in Minnesota, where the majority are U.S. citizens, and just about 0.03% of the Somali population nationwide, according to U.S. Census Bureau data cited by PBS.\n\nSix days later, a 23-year-old content creator dropped a 43-minute YouTube video that had the effect of planting dynamite in a minefield. In a vague Dec. 26 video, former prankster turned anti-immigrant influencer Nick Shirley visited Minnesota day care and health care centers, demanded people who appeared to work at the centers show him children, and accused the businesses of fraud. Shirley in the video is flanked by two masked men, whom he identifies as his security, and is following a man called David who purports to have papers showing evidence of fraud. The Intercept identified David as 65-year-old David Hoch, an eccentric, far-right political operative in the state.\n\nThat late December YouTube video was also lauded by Elon Musk, reposted by the Department of Government Efficiency and led Vice President JD Vance to declare Shirley deserving of a Pulitzer Prize. Trump then unleashed a torrent of retribution against Minnesota, Somalians, and Democratic states in general. \n\nIt doesn’t matter that claims made in Shirley’s video remain unfounded, and that it documents nothing untoward.\n\nIt also doesn’t seem to matter that the initial, 2018 report linking fraud in Minnesota to a Somalia-based terrorist group was debunked by the state, or that the only named source for the article told the Minnesota Star Tribune he was misquoted. (City Journal told the Star Tribune it stands by its reporting.)\n\nTrump has since early December used the fact that the majority of the defendants in each of these fraud cases were members of the Minnesota Somali community as ammunition, opening a dark new chapter in his signature anti-immigration crackdown.","summary":"More than 2,000 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents are on the ground in Minnesota in what President Donald Trump’s...","url":"https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/how-the-right-wing-outrage-machine-prompted-the-conflagration-in-minnesota","image":"https://talkingpointsmemo.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2254655975.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-08 20:46:09","author":"Layla A.
