Email fran.wolfisz@mailonline.co.uk\nBy FRANCINE WOLFISZ \n Published:01:27 BST, 30 April 2025 |Updated:01:41 BST, 30 April 2025 \n\nHomeowners on a new build estate claim they have been 'gagged' from objecting to another housing development because of a clause in their buyer contracts. \nCrest Nicholson built 191 houses in the Highlands Park development in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, in 2020 and has now submitted plans to South Oxfordshire District Council for permission to build 131 more nearby.\nBut residents who bought homes in the first phase say they have been banned from objecting to the second development.\nA guide price on a two-bedroom property on the estate is currently £495,000, while a three-bedroom home is on the market for £620,000 and a four-bed for £850,000, according to listings on Zoopla.\nResidents say they were shocked to discover a clause in their buyer contracts with Crest Nicholson prohibiting them from expressing objections to neighbouring planning applications.\nThe clause stipulates that 'the buyer agrees not to object or cause any objection to be made to any planning application made by the seller in respect of any neighbouring or adjoining land which relates to the development or other residential development, and in particular not to lodge an objection or objections with the local planning authority or relevant government department or object or be represented at any public enquiry called in connection with such planning application'.\nCommunity facilities promised in the first development, such as a community centre and football pitches, will also be relocated, as part of the new planning application.\nResidents say they want to object, but are afraid of the consequences. But one says he will not be 'silenced' by the firm.\n\nHomeowners on a new build estate claim they have been 'gagged' from objecting to plans for more than 100 new homes in a neighbouring field by developer Crest Nicholson\n\nResidents who bought homes in the first phase say they have been banned from objecting to the second development\n\nA guide price on a two-bedroom property on the estate, which was built in 2020, is currently £495,000, while a three-bedroom home is on the market for £620,000 and a four-bed for £850,000, according to listings on Zoopla\nHe said: 'They can do what they want. You're entitled to object.\n'You can put anything into a contract. It doesn't make it legal or defendable.'\nHe says while he would not object to the new homes in the plans, he has expressed an objection to the changing football pitch plans.\nThe resident said other neighbours were scared of lodging objections.\nHe added: 'To the people that have objected, I'm not aware of anyone that's received any feedback from Crest - positive or negative, which is a shame, you would hope that they would contact the residents and say: \"You're one of the stakeholders here.\" That would be really great.\n'I see it as a gagging order. That's the whole purpose of putting it in there. It's to gag you.\n'Whether that's legal or not is undecided, but it's 100 per cent a gagging order.\n'It gives them total freedom to do what they want.\n\nResidents say they were shocked to discover a clause in their buyer contracts with Crest Nicholson prohibiting them from expressing objections to neighbouring planning applications\n\nResidents say they want to object, but are afraid of the consequences of breaking the clause\n\nOne resident said he wondered whether it was legal to include such a clause in the contract\n'It's horrendous. People are afraid. It's intimidation.'\nHe added that most people might have agreed to the contract after skim-reading it, adding that his solicitor, who was recommended by the company, did not mention the clause.\nIt was only in January that he saw the clause after being told by a neighbour.\nHe said: 'I don't think they're going to sue all of us for objecting, but at the same time there are lots of people who want to object that just won't.'\nAn anonymous resident said: 'It's a bit of a weird clause to put in.'\nWere he allowed to object, he said he felt he 'probably' would.\nAnother resident said he initially wondered whether it was possible to include such a clause in the contract.\nHe said: 'I would have thought legally and particularly in the climate we're living in, it's not the way we want to live our lives.\n\nOne resident objecting to the plans said a new development on the nearby green space would 'exacerbate the loss of wildlife'\n\nResidents have spoken out about 'loving' the countryside close to their development \n'If you believe that people are going to be either unduly politicised or awkward for the sake of it, then good won't necessarily come from it.\n'But it seems to me that certainly in a democracy, we give people a voice.\n'I think there was an element of gagging, otherwise why would you put it in there? It's pretty stark, actually: if you wanted to work with the community, you certainly wouldn't write agreements in that form.\n'It's a very aggressive and black-and-white way of doing things.'\nHe said he had written about a number of aspects of the development complaining about the football pitch and facilities and the community centre as he felt the changes had been done 'in haste'.\nThe developers have applied to relocate the community centre to another part of the site, and for additional facilities to accompany the sports pitches, such as toilets and car parking spaces.\nAnother resident said she and her husband would have objected if they were 'allowed to'.\nShe said: 'We've relocated for work. We wouldn't be able to buy in an area like Henley if there had not been a new housing estate.\n\nA neighbour who is renting a house in an estate next to the Crest Nicholson development said they would 'never' buy it because of the planned second phase\n\nA decision on the planning application was due by April 25 but has still not been made\n\nScores of objections have been submitted to the local authority by residents. in the area\n'But we personally love the countryside which we live in and have watched the slower selling of the houses onsite currently - everything else got snapped up really quickly - and we don't want any further development here.\n'There have been a big number of developments around the town which we think fulfill the housing requirement and there is such a lovely amount of biodiversity - we have deer grazing every evening, all these beautiful wildflowers - and it does feel a shame but that's hypocritical for me to say because I live in a new-build house. So we're very torn.\n'It is freedom of speech that we don't have anymore.\n'I would like to exercise my rights.'\nA neighbour who lives in an estate next to the Crest Nicholson development said: 'We're just renting and we would never buy this house because of that.'\nThe plan submitted to South Oxfordshire District Council, the housing authority, is for 131 homes in its 'northern field' - comprising a mix of one- and two-bed apartments, one-bed maisonettes, and two-, three-, four- and five-bed houses - and outline permission for land for up to 20 residential dwellings to be provided and owned by the Henley Community Land Trust.\nA decision was due by April 25, according to the planning portal, but has still not been made.\nScores of objections have been submitted to the local authority by residents. \n\nA Crest Nicholson spokesperson said the clause 'was included in our contracts previously'\n\nThe first housing estate was originally built in 2020 - with residents airing concerns that plans have been put forward for a second nearby\nOne wrote: 'Henley has more than enough appropriate grey and brownfield field sites available for housing without having to destroy a valuable natural green site.\n'It is a mistake to convert this type of natural land into housing, to do so would produce irreversible negative environmental impact and increase the local flooding, pollute the river and destroy the aquifer, exacerbate the loss of wildlife, cause soil degradation and add greenhouse gas to the atmosphere. \n'Each year the field gains more pollinators and native plants, trees and grasses, which sustain a large variety of animals, insects, birds and invertebrates.\n'It provides a run for badgers and a safe place for ground nesting birds and dormice, a feeding ground for nocturnal animals, a breeding ground for moths and small mammals and a larder of airborne insects for owls, skylarks, bats and swifts. \n'It connects the surrounding green areas allowing wild species to roam, feed, find mates and raise their next generation. \n'Britain is already the most nature depleted country in in the world, loss of habitat is the main cause. \n'Blatantly this site, if developed, would be responsible for doing just that.'\nA spokeswoman for Crest Nicholson said: 'This clause has been included in our contracts previously. \n'As a member of the New Homes Quality Code, we regularly review the provisions in our agreements and are currently reviewing our documentation in line with upcoming changes to the Code issued by the New Homes Quality Board.'\nA spokesperson for South Oxfordshire District Council said: 'This isn't a matter we would comment on. The residents would need to seek their own legal advice on this issue.'\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nWe've been banned from objecting to 100 homes next to our new-build estate because of a 'gagging' clause in our contracts - we won't be silenced\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

I've -- I've wanted to do this for many years.'\n\nHe went on to reassure Americans by listing the items where prices have decreased since January – including on gasoline and eggs.\n\n'Hard times are ahead?'

We're stopping the indoctrination of our children, slashing billions and billions of dollars of waste, fraud and abuse, and above all, we're saving the American dream. We're making America great again, and it's happening fast,” said Trump, who added that his whirlwind first 100 days back in office have brought a “revolution of common sense” to the United States.\n\nBut what seemed to animate Trump most in his return to the rallies that have defined his political career was seeing his friends.\n\nAt multiple points during his stem-winding, rambling 89-minute address, the president stopped to acknowledge people in the crowd who he recognized as part of the traveling circus that characterized his three presidential campaigns, which collectively spawned a class of super-fans who followed him from town to town like some people followed The Grateful Dead in that iconic ensemble’s heyday.\n\n“Look at you ‘Front Row Joes,’ he said to one group who gave themselves that nickname because they spent collective years waiting in lines so they could be in the front row for his campaign speeches.\n\n“I’ve missed you guys — I miss the campaign,” the president continued, adding that some of the aforementioned “joes” had “lost a couple of pounds.”\n\n“Perhaps you’re getting one of those jabbers,” he added as he mimed the act of injecting himself with one of the auto injector pens used to administer GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic.\n\nHe also called out Blake Marnell, a mainstay at Trump rallies dating back to 2019 when the president invited him to the stage after spotting him wearing a bespoke novelty suit patterned to look like a brick wall.\n\n“I have Mr. Wall here, this guy — how many rallies have you gone to?”\n\nMarnell replied that he’d been to hundreds by now, at which point Trump suggested he would one day acquire a suit like Marnell’s to wear on stage.\n\nContinuing, Trump went on to boast of the record low border crossing numbers that have been reported since he instituted a crackdown on the right to claim asylum in the United States and reimposed harsh anti-migration policies from his first term, before reliving how the Democratic Party candidate in 2024 changed from then-president Joe Biden to then-vice president Kamala Harris after Biden’s somnolent, confused performance in his sole debate against Trump last June.\n\nReturning to the subject of illegal immigration and his crackdown against it, Trump praise the efforts of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and bragged about having designated a pair of South American street gangs — Tren de Aragua and MS-13 — as “foreign terrorist organizations,” a category the administration claims as giving them the right to bypass due process protections for anyone they deem to be a member of either group.\n\n“We are delivering mass deportation, and it's happening very fast,” he said, adding later that the “worst of the worst” migrants are being sent to what he called a “no-nonsense prison in El Salvador” — the infamous CECOT constructed by self-described Salvadoran dictator Nayib Bukele.\n\nAt that point, the giant video screens erected at the rally venue played a wordless sizzle reel accompanied by dark mood music, showing detainees arriving on American military planes before being processed and huddled into the hellish prison by Salvadoran military police.\n\nTrump called the scenes depicted in the video “lovely” and went on to repeat a series of oft-told but unverified claims he debuted during the 2024 campaign regarding foreign countries emptying prisons and “sending” violent criminals to the U.S. to seek asylum.\n\n“They come in from Africa. The Congo, they emptied out their prisons into our country, but they come from Africa, Asia, South America. They come from all over bad parts of Europe. That's why we've invoked the Alien Enemies Act to expel every foreign terrorist from our soil as quickly as possible,” he said.\n\nThe president’s focus on immigration-related accomplishments not only harkened back to his previous presidential campaign rhetoric, but it allowed him to keep most of his remarks on a subject that remains a relative strength for him amid dismal polling numbers showing him with the lowest approval ratings of any president in the modern era after the first 100 days of an administration.\n\nOne Reuters/Ipsos survey released this week shows just 42 percent of respondents approve and 53 percent disapprove of his performance thus far, a number he said was “actually not bad” while positing that a “legit poll” would give him at least 60 percent approval.\n\nThe Reuters poll also showed that the percentage of respondents who approve of his economic stewardship had declined a point to 36 percent – the lowest level in his current term or in his 2017-2021 presidency, while disapproval rose 5 points to 56 percent.","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/trump-marks-first-100-days-002433139.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/5d558beb812df816605dd5a8595f8aa8","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-30 00:24:33","author":"Andrew Feinberg","authors":["Andrew Feinberg"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.064},{"id":316213038,"title":"Trump highlights ‘revolution of common sense’ at Michigan rally","text":"WARREN, MI — Nearly seven months after his hectic Michigan campaign concluded, President Donald Trump returned to “The Mitten State” for an indoor rally to mark his first 100 days in office.\n\nStanding in front of a banner that read “The Golden Age,” Trump during a 90-minute address championed his policies ranging from border security to the economy to military spending.\n\n“This is the best 100-day start of any president in history,” Trump told a crowd of more than 1,000 people inside Macomb Community College’s gym. “We’re just getting started.”\n\nHe called his early term policies “a revolution of common sense” while criticizing opponents of his initiatives.\n\n“We’re ending illegal immigration,” Trump said. “We’re taking back our jobs. We’re restoring the rule of law.”\n\nTrump used the platform to respond to news that U.S. Rep. Shri Thanedar, a Democrat from Detroit, introduced seven articles of impeachment against Trump earlier in the week. Thanedar criticized Trump for allegedly “violating the constitution” and “doing real damage to our Democracy.”\n\nAt the Tuesday rally, Trump referenced Thanedar as “some guy I never heard of” and “a lunatic.”\n\n“Did I just hear we’re getting impeached again?” Trump said, seemingly jokingly. \n\nEchoing a go-to 2024 campaign message, Trump repeated disproven claims he won the 2020 presidential election against Democrat Joe Biden.\n\n“We love you. We just had the biggest victory (in Michigan),” Trump told the crowd. “We won it twice. We actually won it three times.”\n\nThe president at one point paused his remarks to screen footage showing the March transportation to an El Salvador prison of Venezuelan immigrants who were accused of being gang members.\n\n“I think the No. 1 thing I won on was border (security),” Trump told the crowd. “Democrats have vowed mass invasion and mass migration. We are delivering mass deportation. The worst of the worst are being sent to a no-nonsense prison in El Salvador.”\n\nThe president was critical of judges who have ruled against the constitutionality of his policies, including on border control issues.\n\n“Judges are trying to take away the power given to the president,” Trump said. “I hope, for the sake of the country, the Supreme Court saves us. Nothing will stop me from keeping America safe again.”\n\nTrump also was critical of pollsters and journalists who report on polls detailing Americans’ declining favor of Trump policies. He claimed pollsters “poll more Democrats.”\n\n“97% of stories written about me are negative,” Trump said, “and yet we won in a landslide.”\n\nHe took jabs at other political rivals too.\n\nAt one point, Trump asked the crowd to vote on their favored nickname for former President Joe Biden: “Sleepy Joe or Crooked Joe?”\n\nThe crowd cheered loudest for the latter option.\n\nThe rally was the second of two Michigan stops Tuesday for Trump. He arrived at the college after first visiting Selfridge Air National Guard Base, where the president announced plans to station new fighter jets at the site.\n\nEarlier in the day, White House officials announced Trump on Tuesday planned to sign an executive order to relax some of his 25% tariffs on autos and auto parts. It was news the president relayed later to the crowd at the college, framing it as support for Michigan’s auto industry.\n\n“We’re bringing jobs back to Michigan,” Trump told the crowd at the rally.\n\nHe responded to critics of the high tariff rates aimed at China, saying he planned to work out a “fair deal” with the Asian nation.\n\nTrump also talked about policies and initiatives he plans to pursue before his term ends, including “the largest tax cuts.”\n\n“I will give you the greatest economy in history,” the president said.\n\nTrump repeated a campaign promise that Michigan would serve as a manufacturer of a military defense “dome” that would protect the United States from enemy attacks. He has compared it to the “iron dome” defense system operated by Israel as a protection against missile strikes from neighboring nations.\n\nTrump rallied the crowd to cheer high-profile cabinet members in attendance including Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and Mehmet Oz, the president’s pick to lead Medicare and Medicaid. Trump also rallied cheers for Michigan Republican leaders such as state House Speaker Matt Hall, state Senate Republican Leader Aric Nesbitt, and Michigan Republican Party Chairman Jim Runestad.\n\nTrump during his rally thanked Elon Musk, the billionaire who has led Trump’s administration in slashing federal programs and jobs and attracted the distaste of many Americans unhappy with those cuts.\n\n“He’s an amazing guy,” the president said of Musk, who was not in attendance Tuesday. “He’s a great American. He loves America.”\n\nSeveral high-profile Trump supporters spoke to the crowd before Trump’s arrival at the college gym. \n\nAmong them were Rev. Lorenzo Sewell, a Detroit native and leader of 180 Church in the city, who led the group in an opening prayer.\n\nLivingston County Sheriff Mike Murphy, who hosted a Trump campaign event at the sheriff’s county facilities in August, expressed support for the president’s border control efforts. \n\nBrian Pannebecker, a retired autoworker and outspoken Trump fan who once organized a protest outside a Detroit Lions game against players who kneeled during the national anthem, rallied the Tuesday crowd to applaud the president’s economic policies.\n\n“In his first 100 days, he’s accomplished more than Joe Biden did in four years,” Pannebecker told the room, inciting chants of “U-S-A.”\n\nMike Lindell, founder and CEO of My Pillow, was in attendance but did not address the crowd. Walking among the gym in the hours leading up to Trump’s remarks, Lindell was a regular target for people seeking selfie photos.\n\nThe scene inside Macomb Community College’s gym was a throwback to last summer and fall, when Trump hosted campaign rallies across Michigan in his bid to clinch the swing state’s favor.\n\nOn bleachers and 23 rows of fold-out chairs, supporters sat — and sometimes stood — to cheer the president as he boasted he was successful in delivering on a number of campaign promises.\n\nAnd, like last year’s campaign season, Trump supporters wore some of the standard attire associated with his Make America Great Again (MAGA) movement: Red MAGA hats. Shirts with Trump catchphrases and insults directed at rivals. Hair and beards dyed in colors of the American flag.\n\nWhile some recent polls showed Americans do not agree with Trump’s aggressive efforts in his first 100 days, the crowd inside Macomb Community College cheered approvingly and loudly as he recounted his 2025 executive orders and policy plans.\n\nAlthough, at one point, Trump directed security to remove an attendee who seemingly shouted opposition at the president.\n\nSupporters began filing into the facility five hours before his remarks began at 6 p.m.\n\nDuring the wait, the gym speakers blasted some recognizable Trump campaign soundtrack hits — “YMCA” by The Village People, chief among them — along with tunes from performers including Toby Keith, Guns N’ Roses, DJ Khaled, Dolly Parton, The Weeknd and Toto. Several Billboard-charting singles from Michigan-born Trump supporter Kid Rock’s music catalogue thumped the facility’s walls with bass.\n\nTuesday was not the first time Macomb Community College hosted a Trump event. The school hosted one of the Republican candidate’s last Michigan stops: A Nov. 1 rally, four days before Election Day.\n\nIn September, he hosted a roundtable-style gathering at the college, located about 20 miles north of downtown Detroit. \n\nApril 29 marked Trump’s 99th day since returning to the White House on Jan. 20.\n\nTrump in November 2024 won Michigan’s 15 electoral college votes, flipping the state again in a victory over Democrat Kamala Harris.\n\nMacomb County was one of the southeast Michigan communities where voters favored Trump.\n\nThere, voters chose Trump over Harris, 284,660 votes to 214,977 votes, for a nearly 14-percentage point victory margin.\n\nTrump in 2016 was the first Republican to win Michigan’s vote since 1988. With his victory last year, he added to that bragging right.\n\nTrump’s favor in Michigan has wavered over the years, but his supporters have kept the vote counts close. He defeated Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton by 10,704 Michigan votes in 2016 and then lost to Democratic nominee Joe Biden by 154,188 Michigan votes four years later.\n\nTrump defeated Harris by 80,103 Michigan votes last November.\n\nClick here to follow MLive’s complete coverage of President Trump’s impact on Michigan.","summary":"President Trump showcased deportation efforts and promised \"the greatest economy in history\" at a rally marking his 100th day in office.","url":"https://www.mlive.com/politics/2025/04/trump-highlights-revolution-of-common-sense-at-michigan-rally.html","image":"https://www.mlive.com/resizer/v2/EU4YOPCUSZGEHJRWGQCT4NR4DY.JPG?auth=c9d5b2d7dbab8f41cfcad27d27f40ecd11ec2d79cf542021f2978e7270dfbcfe&width=1280&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-30 00:20:59","author":"Justin Engel","authors":["Justin Engel"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.21},{"id":316213608,"title":"Trump purging Holocaust Memorial Museum board of Biden appointees – including Doug Emhoff","text":"Former second gentleman Doug Emhoff has been removed by the Trump administration from the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council, he announced in a statement Tuesday.\n\nThe museum welcomed Emhoff, who is Jewish, and 11 other President Joe Biden appointees just months ago in January.

I will continue to speak out, to educate and to fight hate in all forms — because silence is never an option.”\n\nIn a written statement, Andy Hollinger, the museum’s spokesperson, told The Independent: “At this time of high antisemitism and Holocaust distortion and denial, the museum is gratified that our visitation is robust and demand for Holocaust education is increasing.\n\nHe added: “We look forward to continuing to advance our vitally important mission as we work with the Trump Administration.”\n\nThe 68-member council includes 55 members appointed by the president as well as five members each from the Senate and House of Representatives, and three ex officio members from the Department of State, Interior and Education.

They were all supposed to serve five-year terms.\n\n“Let me be clear: Holocaust remembrance and education should never be politicized,” Emhoff, the husband of former Vice President Kamala Harris, wrote in a statement announcing his removal. \n\n“To turn one of the worst atrocities in history into a wedge issue is dangerous — and it dishonors the memory of six million Jews murdered by Nazis that this museum was created to preserve,” he added.\n\n“No divisive political decision will ever shake my commitment to Holocaust remembrance and education or to combating hate and antisemitism. I will continue to speak out, to educate and to fight hate in all forms — because silence is never an option.”\n\nIn a written statement, Andy Hollinger, the museum’s spokesperson, told The Independent: “At this time of high antisemitism and Holocaust distortion and denial, the museum is gratified that our visitation is robust and demand for Holocaust education is increasing. \n\nHe added: “We look forward to continuing to advance our vitally important mission as we work with the Trump Administration.”\n\nThe 68-member council includes 55 members appointed by the president as well as five members each from the Senate and House of Representatives, and three ex officio members from the Department of State, Interior and Education. The appointments are typically five-year terms.\n\nThe museum, which opened in 1993, is the country’s first memorial to the victims of the Holocaust. \n\nIn a statement posted to X, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who is also Jewish, wrote: “At this time of rising antisemitism, it is despicable that Trump would use a hallowed institution like the Holocaust Museum to take cheap shots at his perceived political enemies.”\n\nAndrew Weinstein, a former appointee of President Barack Obama and Biden, said he was on the council’s board and served throughout Trump’s first term.\n\n“Moving Biden appointees is petty and vindictive and distracts from - and potentially damages - this important work,” he wrote on social media. \n\nOther members who have been removed included Biden’s former Labor Secretary Tom Perez, Biden’s first chief of staff Ron Klain, Susan Rice — national security adviser to Obama and a domestic policy adviser to the Biden administration — and Anthony Bernal, a senior adviser to Jill Biden. \n\nAll of the individuals had been appointed to the board in January.

Who the hell would vote for these people?” he said. “They’re racing to the courts to help them. But this is not what the people want. This is not what they voted for in record numbers.”\n\nWHITMER JOINS TRUMP IN MICHIGAN TO SAVE SELFRIDGE MILITARY BASE\n\nOn Thursday, White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller is expected to amplify Trump’s social issue achievements, including regarding DEI and women’s sports.\n\n“We’re ending the inflation nightmare,” Trump said on Tuesday. “Getting woke lunacy and transgender insanity the hell out of our government, we’re stopping the indoctrination of our children, slashing billions and billions of dollars of waste, fraud, and abuse. Above all, we’re saving the American dream.”\n\nAt the same time, Trump’s first 100 days have been undermined by the president’s attempts to upend the country’s relationships with its trade partners and security allies, most notably with Ukraine, as well as the federal government through Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency. He has also prioritized retribution, from pardoning Jan. 6 offenders to preventing the Associated Press from covering him over the news outlet’s refusal to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America and repealing funding for Ivy League institutions over allegations of anti-Semitism.\n\nTo that end, during the rally, Trump criticized former President Joe Biden and his Vice President Kamala Harris, particularly Biden’s use of an autopen, along with Rep. Shri Thanedar (D-MI), who this week introduced articles of impeachment, and Republicans who have similarly scrutinized him.\n\n“Every once in a while you have a grandstander Republican,” the president said. “We have some grandstanders every once in a while, not many. But, remember who those grandstanders were and vote them the hell out of office.”\n\nHe added: “We cannot allow a handful of communist, radical-left judges to obstruct the enforcement of our laws and assume the duties that belong solely to the president of the United States.”\n\nTrump chose Michigan for his 100th-day rally, complete with protesters, having concluded all his campaigns in the Great Lakes State, a battleground that helped him win the 2016 and 2024 elections. But Michigan is also a battleground for Trump’s tariff policy, given it is the home of the country’s auto industry.\n\n“I want to say thank you to the autoworkers,” Auto Workers for Trump founder Brian Pannebecker said after being brought onstage by the president. “Thank you so much for supporting the greatest president in our lifetimes.”\n\nThe unintended consequences of Trump’s tariff policy were on display Tuesday, with the president signing another executive order en route to provide temporary relief for automakers from his duties, promoted only weeks ago on what he termed Liberation Day despite each announcement decreasing the value of the stock market and increasing the likelihood of a recession. \n\n“We just wanted to help them during this little transition. Short term,” he told reporters as he departed the White House. “It has to do with a very small percentage. If they can’t get parts, we didn’t want to penalize them.”\n\nThere have been other challenges for Trump too. Aside from national security adviser Mike Waltz and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth‘s misuse of messaging app Signal to discuss classified information, courts have also presented challenges to Trump, from DOGE, including his mass firings and reforms to foreign aid, to immigration, such as stopping birthright citizenship and the deportation of U.S. citizens.\n\nSimultaneously, Trump’s approval rating has entered net negative territory, averaging net negative 7 percentage points, 45% approve-53% disapprove, according to RealClearPolitics. \n\nThe first 100 days of a presidential administration have become an important measure of presidential success since Franklin Roosevelt’s first term in office.\n\nTRUMP TO SIGN EXECUTIVE ORDER GRANTING RELIEF FROM AUTO TARIFFS\n\nNow, as Trump prepares for the next 100 days, the president has indicated his next priority will be passing a budget reconciliation bill through Congress that could expand the tax cuts he championed in 2017. \n\n“I think either we’ve done everything or it’s in the process of being done,” he said on the White House South Lawn. “We want to get and, very importantly, the big, beautiful new deal. If we get that done, that’s the biggest thing, what’s happening in Congress right now. And I think we’re going to get it done.”","summary":"WARREN, Michigan — President Donald Trump reveled in returning to a rally-like atmosphere to mark the first 100 days of his second administration. &#8220;We&#8217;re here tonight in the heartland of our nation to celebrate the most successful first 100 days of any administration in the history of our country, and that&#8217;s according to many, many [&#8230;]","url":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/white-house/3395748/trump-returns-campaign-playbook-michigan-mark-100-days-governing/","image":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/trump-scaled-1024x682.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-30 00:06:28","author":"Naomi Lim and Christian Datoc","authors":["Naomi Lim and Christian Datoc"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.057},{"id":316212162,"title":"Trump fires Kamala Harris's husband from Holocaust board","text":"U.S. President Donald Trump has removed Doug Emhoff, husband of his former rival Kamala Harris, from the Holocaust Memorial Council board, drawing an angry reaction.\n\nEmhoff, who is married to the 2024 Democratic presidential nominee and former vice president, campaigned against anti-Semitism as part of the administration of Joe Biden, who appointed him to the board.\n\n\"Let me be clear: Holocaust remembrance and education should never be politicized,\" Emhoff, who is Jewish, posted on Tuesday, confirming his dismissal.\n\n\"To turn one of the worst atrocities in history into a wedge issue is dangerous -- and it dishonors the memory of six million Jews murdered by Nazis that this museum was created to preserve.\"\n\nSince taking office, Trump has looked beyond politics to impose his brand of right-wing populism on cultural and educational institutions such as Washington's prestigious Kennedy Center and Harvard University.\n\nHe has also sought to settle scores with perceived adversaries -- targeting law firms associated with his political foes, such as Emhoff's employer, Willkie Farr & Gallagher.\n\nSeveral other former officials removed from the Holocaust board include Biden's White House chief of staff Ron Klain, domestic policy advisor Susan Rice and an aide to former first lady Jill Biden, The New York Times reported.\n\nThe White House Presidential Personnel Office sent an email to council members early Tuesday, according to the Times, which read: \"(On) behalf of President Donald J.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy CHARLOTTE DEAN FOR MAILONLINE \n Published:00:01 BST, 30 April 2025 |Updated:00:40 BST, 30 April 2025 \n\nOti Mabuse has opened up about having a 'toxic' relationship with her body image after spending her career as a professional dancer.\nThe former Strictly star, 34, who quit the show in 2022 after seven years, admitted it has been a 'continuing journey' to rebuild a healthy relationship with body.\nOti said part of the journey is accepting that she no longer has a dancer's body after going through 'ups and downs' and welcoming her baby daughter.\nSpeaking to Prima magazine, Oti discussed her body image struggles, how she has adjusted to motherhood and a possible return to Strictly Come Dancing.\nDetailing her early thoughts as a child about her body, Oti said: 'Growing up, I always thought that the people who did the best (in dancing) were the thinnest, and you always felt like, \"If I need to be successful, I need to look like that.\" And I think it's not just Latin and ballroom dancers, it's across the board.\n'All dancers, we always feel like that. And so we then have this very toxic relationship with our bodies, and even when you walk into the room, and if you've lost weight, they go, \"Oh my gosh, she looks so good.\"\n\nOti Mabuse has opened up about having a 'toxic' relationship with her body image after spending her career as a professional dancer\n\nThe former Strictly star, 34, who quit the show in 2022 after seven years, admitted it is a 'continuing journey' to rebuild a healthy relationship with body\n\nOti discussed how dancer's are often judged on 'how small they are' (pictured in 2016)\n'And it's like, \"Wait, do I look good because I'm small, or do I just look good in general?\" Words hold power over a lot of us as women. So it's trying to rebuild that relationship and it's a continuing journey. \n'It will be every day, I guess, for the rest of my life, that I'll just have to work on that relationship, and hopefully by talking about it, it's going to create more of a conversation around the fact that we need to build our relationship with our bodies in a very healthy way.'\nDespite her previous struggles, Oti revealed she has now found peace with her body, telling the publication: 'I'm now coming into the world as a human being who used to dance, not as a dancer. I still dance, but I'm a person first, before the dancer.\n'My body has had its ups and downs; the gaining of the weight, the losing of the weight, having the baby. It's been such a rollercoaster, but I think it's normal to experience that as a woman. Yes, there are some moments where I feel, \"Oh my gosh, I'm not happy with what I look like,\"... \n'And then I have to say to myself in the mirror \"No, you are good. You are perfect. You have had a baby, you've had a human being come out of you. It's okay to not look perfect, as long as you move, as long as you're trying to be healthy.'\nOti's time on Strictly was hugely successful and she walked away a two-time champion following successive wins with Kelvin Fletcher and Bill Bailey.\nReflecting on her time on the show, she said: 'When I look back on Strictly, I think the whole seven-year journey was amazing. I still work on the show. I still do choreography, I'm still talking to the producers.\n'I say that the show brought me everything, like me sitting here today, and the relationship still very much continues. There were ups, there were downs; if you can imagine being the first Black anything, anywhere, there will always be ups and downs.'\n\nOti said part of the journey is accepting that she no longer has a dancer's body after going through 'ups and downs' and welcoming her baby daughter\n\nSpeaking to Prima magazine, Oti discussed her body image struggles, how she has adjusted to motherhood and a possible return to Strictly Come Dancing\n\nOti's time on Strictly was hugely successful and she walked away a two-time champion following successive wins with Kelvin Fletcher and Bill Bailey\n\nReflecting on her time on the show, she said: 'When I look back on Strictly, I think the whole seven-year journey was amazing'\n\nOti is married to fellow professional dancer Marius Iepure, who she shares a little girl whose name is unknown, after giving birth in November 2023\nOti confessed she is regularly asked whether she would ever return to the show and she teased that is a case of 'never say never' \nShe said: 'Everyone asks me [if I'd return to Strictly]. I think right now, with a daughter and everything I'm doing, I'm quite busy, and I'm happy with what I'm doing at the minute. But never say never. The doors are always open, which is really, really nice. \n'Aljaž [Škorjanec] went back and he's doing really well. I went back to choreograph with him and he's just in a different space. He's absolutely sensational. So, you never know.'\nOti is married to fellow professional dancer Marius Iepure, who she shares a little girl whose name is unknown, after giving birth in November 2023.\nElsewhere in the interview, Oti spoke about when she first moved to London and she immediately felt at ease being in an interracial couple.\nShe said: 'When I lived in Germany [where Oti moved to broaden her dancing horizons, appearing on the German version of Strictly], Marius and I used to come to London. The best dance school was in Croydon, and all the best couples would go there. \n'I remember the first time we'd be walking the streets, and there were so many interracial couples. I would say to Marius, \"There's us! There's us! Oh, there we go again!\" And I was just like,\n'Wow, where have I been living? Why am I not here? I just see so many multicultural couples,' and it felt like, 'I need that diversity in my life.' And when I came here, every time we took a lesson, we'd always take a walk. It just felt amazing; it felt like I belonged.'\n\nElsewhere in the interview, Oti spoke about when she first moved to London and she immediately felt at ease being in an interracial couple\n\nOti also touched on her experiences as a mother as she described it as her 'most challenging journey yet'\n\nThe June 2025 issue of Prima is now on sale\nOti also touched on her experiences as a mother as she described it as her 'most challenging journey yet'. \nShe said: 'Motherhood is amazing. It's really incredible. But if I'm being brutally honest, it's also the most challenging and exhausting journey of self-discovery that you will ever be on. \n'I have a one-year-old who's very expressive but doesn't speak, so when something's happening, I don't know what's going on. But she's so incredible, fun and so determined. \n'She's like a little me – and it scares the life out of me, because my mum didn't know what to do with me and I moved to another continent. \n'So now I'm like, \"I will follow her wherever she goes. If she's going to a jungle in the Amazon, we're moving to the jungle in the Amazon.\" She's a very determined child and it's exhausting trying to keep up, but I love it.'\nThe June 2025 issue of Prima is now on sale \nBill BaileyStrictly Come DancingLondon\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nOti Mabuse reveals 'toxic' relationship with her figure and no longer having a 'dancer's body' after leaving Strictly as she teases return to the show\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Subscribe to our YouTube channel to see more of his videos.\n\nHello, this is Victor Davis Hanson. I’d like to talk today, if I could, about the changing of the Democratic guard. There was some news lately that Sen. Dick Durbin from Illinois—he was the author, remember, of the DREAM Act. He was a hardcore liberal. You could even say he was left of center. He’s stepping down. He’s in his 70s.\n\nAnd there’s a changing of the guard. \n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, in some polls, is running—I cannot believe it—behind Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez for his upcoming senatorial bid by 20 points and more in a primary.\n\nAnd then, as a force multiplier, I just saw Rep. Nancy Pelosi, she was at a public event. I think she’s 85, turning 86. She was as incoherent as former President Joe Biden. \n\nSo, what’s Victor trying to say? We’re watching a changing of the guard, both due to aging—and we see that with Joe Biden, and the Biden generation is over with, and Nancy Pelosi. And then the next cohort in their 70s, the septuagenarians, they’re terrified. \n\nDick Durbin’s terrified of being in a primary. And so is Chuck Schumer. He took the dignified way out. Chuck Schumer will probably fight to the very end and be humiliated by AOC.\n\nWho are these people? Well, “the squad,” remember, traditionally was Rep. Ilhan Omar, the Somalian who allegedly had married her brother to gain citizenship access to the United States. There was Ayanna Pressley. She was the radical African American congresswoman. We had, of course, AOC, who was a prominent member. And we have also, in addition, Rep. Rashida Tlaib, she was a member of the squad, she was the Michigan pro-Hamas congresswoman.\n\nThen we had the Democratic National Committee. And we had Ken Martin who won the DNC chairmanship. He’s very much to the left. And really to the left is his subordinate, David Hogg, the vice chairman. He was a survivor of the Parkland shooting, remember, in 2018. And he transmogrified into anti-Second Amendment. But then he got even more and more and more radical. I don’t think he’s ever really done anything except raise money.\n\nBut here’s my point. We’re watching a metamorphosis of the Democratic Party that is out of power. The old guard: Nancy Pelosi, Joe Biden, Chuck Schumer, Dick Durbin—that old guard did not deliver the 2024 election. And they lost the House. They lost the Senate. They don’t have a majority in the Supreme Court. They lost the popular vote. They lost the Electoral College. So, in the eyes of the Democratic youth, they’re discredited.\n\nBut here’s the key. They didn’t lose the 2024 election because they were too far—they didn’t go far left enough. They lost it because former Vice President Kamala Harris and her supporters tried to move her from her hard left. And can I make a parentheses here? She had the most left-wing voting record in the U.S. Senate—to the left of Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. And she couldn’t even move a little bit to the center, although she tried. She said, remember that she was for fracking and she wanted the border wall and she was for deportation? That was all untrue.\n\nBut the point I’m making is, the party tried—in a very anemic fashion—to move to the center, where they knew the votes were. But this new cohort is saying, “You lost the election because you didn’t go far left enough. And maybe we represent 20% of the Democratic registered cohort, but we’re young. And we’re charismatic. And we’re dynamic. And we’re gonna take this party, in the 2026 midterms and the 2028, to victory. And we’re gonna do it by a socialist agenda. And a radical, radical, new, new, new green deal. And an open border. And a trans banner on every campaign event. That’s who we are. And a disarmament. And we’re gonna raise taxes on the billionaires.” And that’s their message. It has no public support.\n\nSo, even though they think they’re charismatic and they’re youthful, we get back to the old proverb of the 80-20 paradigm. The Republican Party has been on the 70% to 80% of where the people are on the border, on foreign policy, on the economy, on social and cultural issues. These people—these Jacobin French revolutionaries—they’re pulling 20% to 30% on this issue.\n\nI’ll leave you with a final thought. The Republicans are not afraid. They’re not afraid of the squad and the Jacobins and this new cohort, the David Hoggs of the world. But you know who’s terrified of them? Dick Durbin, Nancy Pelosi, and Chuck Schumer, because they don’t know how to handle them. They’re part of themselves. It’s an incestuous relationship. \n\nAnd they’re saying to them, “But we’re the old guard.” And they’re saying, “You may be the old guard, but we’re going to guillotine you and get rid of you. And we’re coming in with a revolutionary fervor they’re terrified of.”\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

Gretchen Whitmer onstage for awkward cameo at military event","text":"President Trump put one over on Democratic Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer Tuesday, unexpectedly calling her up to speak at the first of two celebratory events to mark his first 100 days in office. \n\nTrump, 78, was addressing service members at Selfridge Air National Guard Base northeast of Detroit when he unexpectedly singled out Whitmer.\n\n“I want to thank Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer,” the president began. “You know, I’m not supposed to do that. She’s a Democrat. They say, ‘don’t do that, don’t have her here.’ I said, ‘No, she’s going to be here… she’s done a very good job.'”\n\n“For decades, they’ve been trying to save this facility,” Trump also said, “including your governor, who has done a very good job. She came to see me. That’s the reason she came to see me, by the way, to save Selfridge. She was very effective.”\n\nThe president then invited Whitmer — seen by many as a potential candidate for the 2028 Democratic nomination — to say a few words, leaving her visibly ill at ease.\n\n“Well, I hadn’t planned to speak,” Whitmer began, “but on behalf of all the military men and women who serve our country — and serve so honorably on behalf of the state of Michigan — I am really damn happy we’re here to celebrate this recapitalization.”\n\nIt was the second time in recent weeks that Whitmer had been caught in an uncomfortable position near the president. \n\nEarlier this month, the governor hid her face behind a stack of binders rather than show her face to photographers in the Oval Office, where she was waiting for Trump to meet with her to discuss the future of the air base.\n\nWhitmer was roundly mocked by members of her own party after a photo of her playing peek-a-boo was published by the New York Times — and later admitted she regretted trying to duck the cameras.\n\nWhitmer did not attend a rally later Tuesday in Warren, roughly 20 miles north of Detroit.\n\nWhitmer, 53, had been a contender for the vice presidential slot alongside then-candidate Joe Biden in 2020 — but was passed over for then-California Sen. Kamala Harris.\n\nWhitmer also re-emerged as a presidential option in the wake of Biden abandoning his 2024 run, though Harris was ultimately given the party’s standard before losing in a landslide to Trump on Election Day.\n\nMichigan went for Trump by more than 80,000 votes last November — and was one of three critical “blue wall” states that flipped in the Republican’s favor in 2024.\n\nThe governor’s office noted in a press release that more than 5,000 Air and Army National Guard members are installed at the Selfridge base, providing an $850 million boost and up to 30,000 jobs to Michigan’s economy.","summary":"“She’s a Democrat. They say: ‘Don’t do that, don’t have her here.’ I said no, she’s got to be here. She’s done a very good job, frankly,” Trump said of Whitmer.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/04/29/us-news/trump-drags-michigan-gov-gretchen-whitmer-onstage-for-awkward-cameo-at-military-event/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/newspress-collage-xl5qel109-1745968074756.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1745953701&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-29 23:33:14","author":"Josh Christenson","authors":["Josh Christenson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.326},{"id":316209168,"title":"Paramount Board Clears Possible Path for Settling Trump’s ‘60 Minutes’ Lawsuit","text":"Lawyers for President Trump and Paramount, the parent of CBS News, are set to begin mediation on Wednesday over a lawsuit brought by Mr. Trump that accuses “60 Minutes” of deceptively editing an interview with his 2024 Democratic opponent, Kamala Harris.\n\nLegal experts have called the suit baseless and an easy victory for CBS. But Paramount is entering the talks prepared to make a deal.\n\nIn an April 18 meeting, the Paramount board outlined acceptable financial terms for a potential settlement with the president, according to three people with knowledge of the internal discussions. The exact dollar amounts remain unclear, but the board’s move clears a path for an out-of-court resolution.\n\nShari Redstone, the company’s controlling shareholder, has said she favors settling the case.

Email tips@dailymail.com\nBy CODIE BULLEN FOR MAILONLINE \n Published:23:51 BST, 29 April 2025 |Updated:00:29 BST, 30 April 2025 \n\nGeorgia Toffolo has revealed why she hasn't taken husband James Watt's surname following their low-key wedding in Scotland.\nThe I'm A Celeb star, 30, wed the Brewdog founder in March, as the couple eloped to North East Scotland on a fishing boat. \nAnd during an Instagram Q&A session on Tuesday, one fan directly asked if she has taken James' surname.\nIn a clip, she responded: 'I love that someone's asked this question. So to answer directly no I haven't, but I wonder whether my feelings on that might change as the time goes on. I don't know.\n'I'm sort of in two minds about the whole thing. I think my surname is such a big part of my identity, it literally is my name, as most people know me. \n'So I feel quite wedded to it, but at the same time I'm quite traditional and you know if we have children one day they will 100% have James' surname so it would be a bit weird if I don't. \n\nGeorgia Toffolo has revealed why she hasn't taken husband James Watt's surname following their low-key wedding in Scotland\n\nThe I'm A Celeb star, 30, wed the Brewdog founder in March, as the couple eloped to North East Scotland on a fishing boat\n'But for now from a work perspective and how I perceive myself, like Toff is a really big part of me, and to be really frank I can't be bothered with the admin.'\nGeorgia also recently shared a rare insight into being a stepmother to her husband James Watt's children.\nGeorgia admitted she 'never expected to marry someone with kids' but has fitted into the role just fine.\nJames shares two children with ex-wife Johanna Basford, a Scottish illustrator whose colouring book for adults, The Secret Garden, has sold more than ten million copies worldwide.\nSitting in her hyperbaric oxygen chamber, which ranges between £8,000 and £35,000, the Made In Chelsea star shared a playful video larking around with her two stepchildren.\nHyperbaric oxygen therapy increases delivery of oxygen to the body by providing pure oxygen in an enclosed space with higher than normal air pressure. \nAs she relaxed in her latest wellness ritual with an oxygen mask on, his children poked fun at her through the microphone.\nShe captioned her post: '\"How is it being a step mum?\" is my most asked question. This video sums it up.\n\n'I love that someone's asked this question. So to answer directly no I haven't, but I wonder whether my feelings on that might change as the time goes on. I don't know'\n\nGeorgia and James later ditched their fishing attire for much more glamorous ensembles for their church service \n\n'I never expected to marry someone with kids at 30, but I feel so lucky.\n'Also yes, I’m in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber… my fave biohacking tool.\n'Over and out from the baby biohacker.'\nToff couldn't stop giggling as she sat in the chamber wearing Princess Diana's iconic 'black sheep' jumper.\nGeorgia and James got engaged in October after the millionaire proposed with an exquisite eight carat triple-diamond studded band estimated to be worth £200,000 during a romantic getaway in Greece for Georgia's 30th birthday.\nAnd after the BrewDog founder previously insisted that the pair would be tying the knot this year, it appears that the couple were true to their word - though guests only had 48 hours notice to attend.\nJames wrote on his Instagram: 'Georgia and I got married today.\n\nGeorgia has shared a rare insight into being a stepmother to her husband James Watt's children on Wednesday\n\nThe I'm A Celeb star, who wed the Scottish Brewdog founder last month, admitted she 'never expected to marry someone with kids' but has fitted into the role just fine\n\n Georgia Toffolo reveals shock contents of shared bank account with millionaire husband James Watt \n'Some key details: 1st March 2025 57.6722° N, 2.3372° W (Gardenstown, Northeast Scotland) 6°C, 17-knot winds (because Scottish weather never disappoints) Spaniel ring bearer\n'Guests - whoever could get there with 24 hours notice, Scottish honeymoon incoming. Married in the same church my grandparents were married in'\nGeorgia looked stunning for her big day, slipping into a cream, fleece off-the-shoulder dress - perfect for keeping her warm in the chilly Scottish weather.\nThe I'm A Celebrity star styled her blonde locks into an elegant up do' and added dainty diamond earrings and a flowing white veil to her bridal look.\nPerhaps not very bridal were the chunky brown boots she donned with the outfit, though this may have been for health and safety reasons amid their photoshoot on the boat.\nMeanwhile, James himself rocked an unconventional wedding outfit, donning a cream beanie hat and a thick cream jumper worn beneath blue fishing overalls.\nThe couple certainly appeared to get in the spirit of things, with Georgia and James pulling different expressions as they got to grips with some lobsters.\n\nJames shares two children with ex-wife Johanna Basford, a Scottish illustrator (pictured together in 2016)\nGeorgia's post was greeted with a plethora of delightful comments from her fans and celebrity pals, who were equally shocked and overjoyed at her big news.\nAfter sharing her images to social media, Georgia shared a video to her Instagram stories shortly after walking down the aisle, excitedly remarking: 'We just got married!'\nGeorgia, who was sat in a car next to James - who at this point was clad in a smart, dark suit - said to the camera: 'It was so unchoreographed! We just came out the church and were like \"wait, where do we go now?\" So we just sat in the car!\n'We're going to meet everyone now but it's the best day of our lives!

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy SONIA HORON FOR DAILYMAIL.COM \n Published:00:25 BST, 30 April 2025 |Updated:00:29 BST, 30 April 2025 \n\nThe director of the upcoming 'Freaky Friday' sequel revealed she 'begged' Jodie Foster for a nostalgic cameo, but the star refused. \n'Freakier Friday' reunites Lindsay Lohan, 38, and Jamie Lee Curtis, 66, the stars of the beloved 2003 body-swapping film, while Jodie, 66, originated the role in the 1976 Freaky Friday that launched the franchise.\nNisha Ganatra, the director of the upcoming movie, revealed she tried to get Jodie to join the film — which is set to hit theaters August 8 — to no avail.\n'We begged her,' Ganatra, 50, told Entertainment Weekly, before revealing that Jodie declined. 'She's not going to do it.' \n'Honestly, we tried everything,' the filmmaker shared, explaining that she 'never found out why' the Silence of the Lambs star refused. \n'We were going to make her the principal at the school,' Ganatra said, in reference to the school Lohan's character Anna goes to.\n\nJodie Foster, 66, refused to do a nostalgic cameo in the upcoming Freakier Friday film, despite the director 'begging' her; pictured in February \n\nThe Freaky Friday sequel reunites Lindsay Lohan , 38, and Jamie Lee Curtis , 66, the stars of the beloved 2003 body-swapping film\n\nJodie originated the role in the 1976 Freaky Friday that launched the franchise; pictured in a still\nThe 'Freaky Friday' franchise launched with the 1976 hit starring Foster and Barbara Harris.\nBefore Lohan and Curtis led the successful 2003 remake, the series saw some TV movie sequels and a stage musical adaptation.\nFoster previously recalled her contrasting experiences as a child actor in 1976, starring in the family friendly 'Freaky Friday' and the Oscar-nominated, R-rated 'Taxi Driver.'\n\n Fans are all saying the same thing about Freakier Friday trailer \nIn Taxi Driver, Foster, who was 12-years-old at the time, played the role of Iris Steensma, a teen prostitute. \n'[My mother] really wanted to make sure that I would go back and forth and do different kinds of movies and so that people wouldn't pigeonhole me as one type of character,' she said in a 2002 interview with NPR.\n'And at that time, you know, Freaky Friday was probably the first feminist movie out there for youngsters.'\nFreakier Friday will follow a similar plotline to the first movie in which Lohan and Curtis' characters switch bodies - but with a big twist.\nThe official trailer kicks off with Lohan (Anna) and her mom Curtis (Tess) talking to a fortune teller - played by SNL alum Vanessa Bayer.\nAs she gave them a reading, the fortune teller could be heard saying, 'Your lifelines... it's like they've intersected before! You've walked in each other's path.'\nLindsay and Jamie then looked at each other and pretended to be shocked over the revelation.\nHowever, the fortune teller added, 'You learned a lesson. A lesson that may serve you again.'\nThe next morning, Lohan and Curtis wake up to shockingly realize they were no longer in their bodies and loudly scream into the mirror as they peer at their reflections.\n\n'We begged her... Honestly, we tried everything,' Nisha Ganatra, 50 (pictured) the director of the upcoming movie, told Entertainment Weekly, before revealing that Jodie declined \n\nGanatra added that she 'never found out why' the Silence of the Lambs star refused to do the cameo; Foster seen in February at the Screen Actors Guild Awards\n\nFoster previously recalled her contrasting roles at age 12 in 'Freaky Friday' and the Oscar-nominated 'Taxi Driver,' where she played a teen prostitute, noting her mother's desire to avoid her being 'pigeonholed'; seen in a 1976 still from Taxi Driver \n\nBut all is not what it seems when Lindsay's daughter Harper (Julia Butters) and soon-to-be stepdaughter Lily (Sophia Hammons) appear to also be involved in the switch as well. \nCurtis can then be seen dramatically saying, 'My face looks like a Birkin bag that's been left out in the sun to rot!'\nThe rest of the teaser shows snippets as the family figure out how to reverse the switch while pretending to be each other in their normal daily lives.\nAt the end, Curtis and Lohan strolled down a sidewalk while glammed up, with Jamie telling Lindsay, 'Okay, I'll let you know when it's time for you to make your sexy grand entrance.'\nShe replies with, 'Sexy grand entrance?' and the scene cuts to Chad Michael Murray pulling up in a motorcycle and removing his helmet.\n'Oh, like that,' Lohan says out loud which concluded the trailer.\nThe premise of the sequel is: 'Years after Tess and Anna endured an identity crisis, Anna now has a daughter and a soon-to-be stepdaughter.\n'As they navigate the challenges that come when two families merge, Tess and Anna discover that lightning might strike twice,' per an IMDB synopsis.\nOther stars that have been cast in the movie include Manny Jacinto, Mark Harmon, Ryan Malgarini, Haley Hudson and Christina Vidal Mitchell.\n\nFreakier Friday will follow a similar plotline to the first movie in which Lohan and Curtis' characters switch bodies - but with a big twist; the duo seen April 3\n\nThe 2003 movie raked in $160.8 million in the box office on a budget of $26 million; Lindsay and Jamie Lee seen in a still from the Freakier Friday trailer\n\nThe 'Freaky Friday' sequel is set to hit theaters August 8\n\nLate last year in November, Lindsay appeared on The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon and reflected on reprising her role of Anna alongside Curtis in the sequel.\n'It's just been such a labor of love to make happen,' she gushed. 'Jamie [Lee Curtis] and I... even at the table read, we were just smiling so big that we couldn't...\n'I don't think we were acting well because we were so happy. But the movie's funny - it's really funny,' the Mean Girls actress added.\nFreaky Friday (2003) earned positive reviews from critics upon its release and earned Curtis a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress in a Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy.\nThe movie also raked in $160.8 million in the box office on a budget of $26 million.\nJamie Lee CurtisJodie FosterLindsay Lohan\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nJodie Foster REFUSED Freakier Friday cameo with Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

The order would prevent “stacking” of Trump’s various tariffs on auto part imports for vehicles manufactured in the US.\n\nHis administration has imposed 25 percent tariffs on foreign auto imports, blanket 10 percent levies on nearly all trade partners, 25 percent tariffs on steel and aluminium, as well as 25 percent tariffs on trade with Mexico and Canada not covered under a pre-existing deal.\n\nTrump has framed the moves as part of a hard reset to force industries back to the US, a claim he repeated to reporters in his Michigan speech.\n\n“They all want to come back to Michigan and build cars again,” he said. “You know why? Because of our tax and tariff policy.”\n\nMichigan significant\n\nReporting from the rally, Al Jazeera’s Patty Culhane said the location was significant. Trump won the so-called battleground state of Michigan in the election last year, but the state, and its reliance on the auto industry, could be one of the hardest hit by his tariff policy.\n\n“We’re just about 20 miles [32km] down the road from Detroit, Michigan. That’s the home of the ‘Big Three’ automakers: General Motors, Ford and Stellantis,” Culhane said.\n\n“We’ve seen automakers really come out against these tariffs because virtually no car is made completely in the United States, as Donald Trump wants to see happen,” she said.\n\n“Meanwhile, in the crowd, you see a lot of T-shirts that say ‘UAW’, the United Auto Workers union. The union came out in favour of these tariffs because they believe, in the long run, it will force companies to bring jobs back to the US.”\n\nRecent polls have shown the enthusiasm among Trump’s supporters at the Michigan rally is not reflected among the wider public, with nearly every major pollster finding higher disapproval than approval for the president in recent days.\n\nThese included separate Morning Consult and New York Times/Siena polls that showed 54 percent disapproval, a Marist College poll that showed 53 percent disapproval and an Ipsos poll that recorded 55 percent disapproval.\n\nTrump dismissed the polls as “fake” and run by a “bunch of crooked people”.\n\nHours earlier on Tuesday, The Conference Board, an organisation that tracks views on the US economy, released new data showing tanking US consumer confidence.\n\nConfidence fell 7.9 points to 86 in April as Trump’s tariff rollout caused widespread economic uncertainty, the lowest level since May 2020 at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWhile no new trade deals have been reached since the country-specific tariffs were announced, and then paused, Trump told his supporters that officials were “coming from all over the world to see your president”.\n\n“They want to make a deal,” he said.","summary":"President pledges to bring jobs to US in &#039;achievement speech&#039;, as tariff policies continue to cause economic disruption.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/29/trump-delivers-speech-in-michigan-marking-one-hundred-days-in-office?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AP25119807421993-1745965866.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-29 23:26:27","author":"Al Jazeera,Apps Support","authors":["Al Jazeera","Apps Support"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.471},{"id":316206200,"title":"Love Island spin-off featuring the show's biggest success stories who will spill their behind the scenes secrets set to mark 10th anniversary","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTuesday, Apr 29th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrince William and Kate Middleton share tender moment in new photo to mark 14 years of marriage\n\nControversial Irish rappers Kneecap DROPPED from top music festival after they told cheering concert-goers to 'kill your local MP' - as pressure mounts for Glastonbury to axe them from its line-up\n\nNotorious hackers are 'behind M&S cyber raid': Retail giant calls in Scotland Yard as finger is pointed at gang that blackmails firms for millions\n\nTruth about £1million YouTubers Jonathan Joly and Anna Saccone and trans daughter they're accused of exploiting as they creep back from deleting 3,000 videos\n\nSARAH VINE: The Queen asked just ONE thing of Harry and Meghan.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy CHRISTINE RENDON FOR DAILYMAIL.COM \n Published:00:18 BST, 30 April 2025 |Updated:00:22 BST, 30 April 2025 \n\nDemi Lovato continued sparking Ozempic rumors as she shared snaps from her trip to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico on Tuesday. \nThe star, 32, stayed cool in a flowing blue skirt that was fashionably belted around her svelte physique in addition to a print T-shirt and sunglasses.\nWhile the outfit covered up her body, several fans still couldn't help but notice her weight loss and suggested Ozempic, the popular medication many have been using to slim down, may be behind her new look. \n'Honey just stop the ozempic,' one wrote.\n'Demi ilysm but stop rn with the ozempic you've been perfect for ages pls keep some curves,' another wrote.\n'She has the Ozempic drop in her cheeks,' another claimed.\n\nDemi Lovato continued stirring Ozempic rumors as she shared snaps from her trip to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico\n'Ozempic Queen,' one wrote with a crown emoji.\n\n Demi Lovato goes braless in plush robe after fans accused her of ditching non-binary punk image \n'Ozempic hitting hard,' another claimed.\nThe post captured Demi posing on a balcony with a view of the ocean and was captioned with two butterfly emojis. \nAnother post Demi shared last week which included a snap of her slimmed down belly also raised Ozempic suspicions amongst followers. \nDemi has been candid over the years about her various issues with her body, including the fact that she used to be bulimic.\nIn March 2021 she posted an Instagram update revealing her trim midriff and declared she had 'Accidentally lost weight.'\nShe wrote that she did not 'count calories,' 'over exercise' and 'restrict or purge' any longer, adding: 'And I especially don't live my life according to the diet culture.'\nLast year she revealed she had been in recovery from bulimia for 'going on six' years and how she was learning to accept her figure with the help of a treatment team.\n'I have a treatment team that I work with that helps me stay in recovery, and I’ve been in recovery from bulimia for about five, going on six, years now,' she told Penn Badgley during an appearance on his podcast Podcrushed.\n\nFans wondered if Demi's weight loss could be attributed to Ozempic\n\nThough she was fully-clothed, several fans still noticed her body\n\nDemi pictured the day she took the photos at the grand opening weekend of The Tryst Puerto Vallarta on Saturday\n\nShe captioned the post with two butterfly emojis\n\nLovato radiated with a professional-quality coat of makeup on her complexion\n\nShe shielded her eyes in style with sunglasses\n\n'I'm trying to learn body acceptance rather than body positivity, because body positivity feels like I can't even reach that yet. I have to work on body acceptance, body neutrality, because that feels like a goal I can reach.\n'And so some days I just work on, and I do this with my treatment team, I have a nutritionist and a therapist that specializes in eating disorders.\n'And I just work with them. We come up with tools... we do sessions on body image and they provide me with a ton of insight.\n'The main thing that I’m working on is just body acceptance, and just looking in the mirror and being like, \"This body is strong.\" Very basic, elementary affirmations.\n'But like, \"This body saved my life and fought for my life when I overdosed.\" \"This body is a miracle.\" That's what I have to focus on, because loving my body and having full acceptance over it... it feels too far away right now.'\nOzempicMexicoPenn BadgleyDemi Lovato\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nDemi Lovato continues to spark Ozempic rumors with extreme weight loss\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy AMELIA WYNNE FOR MAILONLINE \n Published:00:00 BST, 30 April 2025 |Updated:00:14 BST, 30 April 2025 \n\nAlex Horne has revealed the one big reason why he thinks he ended up working in comedy.\nThe Taskmaster star and funnyman, 46, spoke on the Dish podcast with Nick Grimshaw and Angela Hartnett where he opened up about being the middle child.\nAlex is married to Northern Irish newsreader and journalist Rachel, 45, and they share three children Thomas, Barnaby and Dara, and he has now spoken about how his own upbringing influenced his career.\nHe said on the podcast: 'So, I am the middle of three boys, and I've got three boys as well. And my middle son is so comfortable, he- 'cause the oldest one, all the pressure's on them, the younger one are babied all the time. \n'Middle one you do what you want. I loved it. Honestly, I think that's why I'm a comedian, so I'm in this band and three of us are the middle of three boys. \n'We all grew up together. And we all felt like we were ignored-in a good way, sort of just left to get on with it. So, I recommend it.'\n\nAlex Horne has revealed the one big reason why he thinks he ended up working in comedy\n\nAlex is married to Northern Irish newsreader and journalist Rachel, 45, and they share three children Thomas, Barnaby and Dara\nHe added: 'I loved it. I really did like it, I recommend it. But if you are the second born and you can encourage your parents to have another. Then do that.'\nAlex has become one of the richest hosts on television since the huge success of his comedy show creation, Taskmaster. \nHe created the concept for the notorious Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 2010 and managed to score a deal with Dave TV to create a show from 2015. \nAlex might co-host alongside the well-known actor Greg Davies but accounts posted by his company, Shakey Productions Ltd, show that he has greatly benefited from the show, leaving him earning £7.5million in a year. \nThe father-of-three is now said to be in the same league as household names Ant & Dec and Jack Whitehall. \nIn 2019, Taskmaster was scooped up by Channel 4 and has since completed 20 successful seasons.\nThe show has been nominated for a BAFTA four times, winning in 2020 after beating The Last Leg, The Graham Norton Show and The Ranganation. \nAt the time the country was still facing lockdown restrictions, causing most of the award ceremony to be hosted via Zoom calls. \n\nThe Taskmaster star and funnyman, 46, spoke on the Dish podcast with Nick Grimshaw and Angela Hartnett where he opened up about being the middle child\n\nIt was revealed last year that Alex has become one of the richest hosts on television since the huge success of his comedy show creation, Taskmaster (seen with host Greg Davies) \nTaskmaster provides lots of laughs by making five famous contestants take part in head scratching challenges in order to win their forfeited possessions. \n\n Taskmaster star's Alex Horne's staggering earnings revealed after huge success of the comedy show \nThe show has seen a wide variety of celebrities including Iain Stirling, Joe Thomas, Katherine Ryan and Joe Wilkinson.\nDespite the huge success in the UK, the show flopped when a US version was created. \nShortly after winning the 2020 BAFTA the show was cancelled after only one episode aired leaving ratings extremely low. \nThe comedy show debuted to a 0.1 rating among adults 18-49 and only 212,000 viewers, according to Variety.\nDish from Waitrose is available on all podcast providers. \nNick Grimshaw\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nTaskmaster's Alex Horne reveals the one big reason why he thinks he ended up working in comedy\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

The two sat down for an Oval Office interview to commemorate Trump’s first 100 days, releasing the first clip where the two sparred over Trump’s tariffs.\n\n The interview will air at 8 p.m. on Tuesday.\n\nThe conversation closed the loop on Trump’s hatred for ABC News and Moran’s long career covering the White House.\n\nMoran currently serves as ABC’s senior national correspondent, a job he earned after decades at the network in roles such as chief foreign correspondent, co-anchor of Nightline, and the network’s chief White House correspondent.\n\nA Chicago native who graduated from Lawrence University in 1982 (with a singular IMDB credit as an extra in The Heartbreak Kid), Moran started at ABC in 1997 after a decade at CourtTV, where he built a deep expertise in covering legal matters.\n\nHe covered a number of high-profile stories, including O.J. Simpson’s murder case and the trials of Erik and Lyle Menendez for murdering their parents. He also extensively covered the Supreme Court.\n\nThe veteran newsman broke into political coverage by covering President Bill Clinton’s tenure, and then Vice President Al Gore’s presidential campaign. He scored the first interview with him after the 2000 Democratic National Convention and, months later, it was from Moran’s ABC report on the Supreme Court’s Bush V. Gore ruling, cementing Gore’s loss, that Gore’s team learned he would not be president.\n\nMoran also contributed heavily to coverage of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, eventually traveling to Baghdad, Iraq, in 2003 to report on the U.S.’ war in the nation.\n\nIn his role as Nightline co-anchor, Moran reported on Barack Obama extensively through his campaign for president and his eventual tenure in the White House. The two sat down for nine one-on-one interviews, including one in July 2009 to promote the Affordable Care Act. \n\nThe White House Correspondents’ Association later awarded Moran with the Merriman Smith Award for excellence in presidential coverage under deadline pressure.\n\nMoran later became the network’s London-based chief foreign correspondent in 2014. Still, he kept a finger on U.S. politics, writing last year that he believed Trump would win in 2016.\n\n“I told colleagues Trump would win. (People thought I was crazy.)” he wrote on X.\n\nMoran eventually moved back to Washington, D.C. in 2018, where he continued to cover Trump alongside the city’s political centers in Congress and the Supreme Court. “It’s like drinking from a fire hose,” Moran told Lawrence University in 2019. “It’s hard to keep your perspective.”\n\nThe decision to have Moran interview Trump instead of another one of the network’s legion of stars partly reflects the trepidation networks feel in engaging with the vengeful president prone to attacking—and investigating—his enemies, especially one home to many of his least-favorite anchors.\n\nTrump sued ABC News and Stephanopoulos for defamation last year after Stephanopoulos asked Rep. Nancy Mace (R-SC) how she could support a candidate found liable for “rape,” despite a jury finding him liable for sexual abuse instead. The network eventually settled for $16 million and Stephanopoulos, who has since renewed his contract with the network, apologized.\n\nAfter taking a yearslong interest in Muir, who anchors the highly rated World News Tonight and landed Trump’s first televised interview after his 2017 inauguration, Trump soured on him in September after Muir fact-checked him on crime statistics during the only presidential debate between him and Kamala Harris.\n\n“They probably watched the debate and heard this foolish man, this foolish fool, make that statement to me that, ‘no no, crime is coming down, the FBI said it was coming down,’” Trump said during a California press conference in September.\n\nTrump also attacked co-moderator and ABC News anchor Linsey Davis after the debate and claimed she had “hatred in her eyes” after she fact-checked comments he made about abortion.\n\nMoran has also proven somewhat confrontational toward Trump’s allies, calling his “personalized power” over the GOP in 2021 akin to a “Fuhrer” and attacking Vice President JD Vance’s characterization of judicial power as weak.\n\n“Judges ‘say what the law is,’” Moran wrote. “Not generals or prosecutors.”\n\nBut Moran’s personal indifference and professional fascination toward Trump may have helped him secure the sit-down.\n\n“This year I said it felt like Trump would win again. Why?” he wrote on X shortly after November’s election. “Not polls (it seemed to me they never really caught up with the constant growth of the Trump Movement.) But because almost everywhere I looked—in my own neighborhood, out on the campaign trail, on social media and old media—you could see and sense that millions of *new converts* were joining this movement.\"","summary":"Heidi Gutman/Disney General Entertainment Content via Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump has spent the last year waging war with ABC News’ biggest stars, whether it was taking George Stephanopoulos to court or complaining about presidential debate moderator David Muir’s hair.\n\nBut on Tuesday, Trump granted his first network interview since he took office to ABC’s Terry Moran.

Jeff Bezos is very nice. Terrific. He solved the problem very quickly. He did the right thing,' Trump said.\n\n'He's a good guy,' he added.\n\nDailyMail.com has reached out to Amazon for comment. \n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said she had just spoken to President Trump about the Amazon bombshell at her Tuesday press briefing.\n\nShe said Trump's message was clear: 'This is a hostile and political act by Amazon.' \n\nThe president was reacting to news that Amazon plans to display the cost of his tariffs on countries like China along with the price of each product for sale on the website.\n\nPunchbowl News first reported the move citing a 'person familiar with the plan.' \n\nLeavitt expressed outrage at the world's biggest online retailer, accusing them of acting in a partisan manner. \n\n'Why didn't Amazon do this when the Biden administration hiked inflation to the highest level in 40 years?' she asked. \n\nTwo senior White House officials revealed to CNN that the president personally phoned Jeff Bezos to voice his dissatisfaction with the proposal. \n\n'Of course he was p***ed,' an aide told CNN about Trump. \n\n'Why should a multibillion dollar company pass off costs to consumers?'\n\nShortly after their call, an Amazon company spokesperson told Reuters they had no intention of enacting the tariff labeling on their website, but confirmed they had explored the idea.\n\n'The team that runs our ultra low cost Amazon Haul store considered the idea of listing import charges on certain products. This was never approved and (is) not going to happen,' the spokesperson said.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Leavitt accused Amazon of serving as a willing tool of Chinese propaganda. \n\n'It's not a surprise because, as Reuters recently wrote, Amazon has partnered with a Chinese propaganda arm. So this is another reason why Americans should buy American,' Leavitt said during a White House press briefing. \n\nLeavitt cited a December 2021 news story detailing how Amazon partnered with an arm of China's propaganda apparatus to create a special selling portal.\n\nIt removed their ratings system and comments for Chinese books that were receiving low responses.\n\nThe report noted that former press secretary for President Barack Obama, Jay Carney, served as Amazon's global head of lobbying and public policy operations.\n\nHe traveled to Beijing to meet with Chinese officials and helped draft a briefing document on ways to satisfy their demands. \n\nWhile Trump argues that his tariffs will help return jobs and industry back to the United States, estimates show that they will cost American households significantly on every day goods and services.\n\nThe Budget Lab at Yale University estimated that American households could face additional costs of up to $4,400 a year, citing the unprecedented high retaliatory tariffs placed on China.\n\nThe White House continues to make minor adjustments to tariffs on China, urging them to come to the table for negotiations.\n\nTrump's new tariffs also heavily affect Chinese-born online shopping websites Temu and Shein, as the president eliminated the trade loophole allowing packages under $800 to come into the United States duty free.\n\nThe sweeping tariffs are also impacting Trump's approval rating.\n\nHe has seen a drop in his approval rating in Daily Mail polling for the first time as he reaches 100 days of his second administration, with voters worried about how tariffs will impact their wallets.\n\nThe president's approval in the Daily Mail/J.L. Partners poll fell nine points from 54 per cent on April 17 - when his popularity was at a record high - to 45 per cent this week.\n\nThe decline is universal with voters increasingly concerned by issues that were critical to Trump's victory over Kamala Harris in the presidential election: rising prices and the economy. \n\nSix in ten say the economy is bad or getting worse, including 49 per cent of Republicans. Many believe food and their favorite products are getting more expensive.\n\n'He is pushing things like tariffs that will hurt us economically in the future,' one male GOP voter from California, who backed Trump in 2024, told the survey.\n\nHowever, Trump still has strong support from his loyal base with more than 50 per cent approval among men, white Americans and Republicans.\n\nIt is the first time since the inauguration voters have indicate their views are becoming more negative, with Trump's bold tariff policies sparking a furious international response and volatility in the financial markets.\n\nThe president has slammed polls that have his approval rating underwater as 'fake' and said on Monday night: 'We are doing GREAT, better than ever before'.\n\nTrump's first 100 days in office has been jam-packed with policies that have upended tradition in the federal government.\n\nElon Musk's DOGE has taken an axe to government spending in a bid to cut billions from a bloated federal budget.\n\nAlmost every day, Trump has been in the Oval Office signing a flurry of executive orders overturning decades of the status quo in Washington.\n\nHe has also sparked diplomatic shockwaves with threats to take over Greenland, Canada and the Panama Canal, and pulled no punches in his talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to end the war with Russia.\n\nWhen asked to pick his biggest mistake, voters overwhelmingly said 'tariffs', while the 'border' was seen as the greatest success.\n\nThe Trump administration promoted its immigration crackdown on Monday by lining the White House driveway with dozens of mugshots of migrants who have been arrested.","summary":"Donald Trump said he was able to settle things with Jeff Bezos Tuesday afternoon after Amazon announced it will include the cost of tariffs on the price tag for products.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14661505/trump-jeff-bezos-war-amazon-tarrifs.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/29/22/97842857-0-image-m-13_1745961708546.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/04/29/6547678655107805943/1024x576_MP4_6547678655107805943.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-29 22:54:05","author":"Charlie Spiering,Editor,Stephen M.

Just golfed with Obama not too long ago . . . Now ya get out my mentions with all this politics and have amazing day.”\n\nIt was just a golf outing, not an endorsement or an expression of support for Trump.\n\nYet the public shaming is a tactic we’ve seen repeatedly — viewed as acceptable, even expected, specifically because of Barkley’s identity.\n\nHe is black and a man, and our demographic is only tolerated if we’re doing as we’re told.\n\nRecall when former President Barack Obama lambasted black men during the 2024 campaign for our “lack of enthusiasm” about Kamala Harris.\n\nThe moment we dared to ask questions about the Democratic candidate’s competence, Obama transformed into a finger-wagging male feminist who implied our independent thought was a relic of misogyny.\n\nTo the left, it’s very clear there are only two types of acceptable black men: those who remain silent and do as they’re told, and those who loudly and effeminately defend a downtrodden ideology that infantilizes us.\n\nThe insults that flew at Barkley from anonymous accounts, calling him a “coon” and worse for according equal respect to Trump and Obama, must be seen as attempts to control black male behavior.\n\nBarkley said nothing about his personal politics, but America’s leftists seem to think of themselves as hammers — and that any contrary political action made by a black man is a nail that requires their force.\n\nPartisans cannot conceive that any individual can choose not to take a side, and partisans of the left-wing variety believe that anything a black person does must be motivated by group activism.\n\nThat’s the very definition of racism.\n\nBarkley committed the cardinal sin of racial politics by not caring about racial politics — and for his blasphemy he must suffer the damnation inflicted upon him by our society’s most race-obsessed.\n\nWhat the effeminate left doesn’t understand is that you can’t shame strong men into apologizing when they feel they did nothing wrong, and you can’t guilt them into changing their behavior to appease strangers.\n\nJust like I respect Barkley’s decision to meet with Trump, I respect Jalen Hurts’ choice to stay home.\n\nA difference in their political perspectives doesn’t make either man more or less black.\n\nAdam B. Coleman is the author of “The Children We Left Behind” and founder of Wrong Speak Publishing.","summary":"Left-wing partisans believe that anything a black person does must be motivated by group identity.

I do, all the time. And every single time I’m furious when I get the bill because there’s always more charges—many, many more charges—than I’d anticipated. Concession fee recovery. Vehicle licensing cost recovery. Customer facility charge. State tax. And on and on. By the time you’re done, you might end up paying up almost double the stated rental cost. \n\nYou might have a problem with all the extra charges, but at least you know what they are. So why shouldn’t Amazon—or any other business—provide the same transparency when it comes to charges associated with Trump’s tariffs? Well, because the president will be butthurt about it, it seems. In response to a question about reports Amazon would be showing such costs beside the price of an item on its site, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt blasted the proposal as a “hostile and political act.” \n\nAll this after Amazon head Jeff Bezos paid Melania Trump a reported forty million dollars for a documentary film. This is after Bezos contributed a million dollars to Trump’s inauguration. This is after Bezos killed a presidential endorsement of Kamala Harris from his newspaper, The Washington Post, and then declared that its editorial page will now be focused on “personal liberties and free markets.” \n\nBezos, of course, immediately retreated. In a statement, Amazon said the tariff line item was considered only for its budget-conscious Amazon Haul division, and that, while the idea had been bandied about, “This was never approved and is not going to happen.” \n\nFunny how the only way to bend the knee far enough for Trump is to snap one’s leg in two. \n\n(Of Bezos, Trump later added: “He solved the problem very quickly. He did the right thing. Good guy.”)\n\nTo be clear: it was never going to happen because Bezos is a coward. One could, perhaps, more charitably describe his acquiescence as “corporate shrewdness,” but I prefer to call a thing by its name. If listing taxes on a car rental receipt aren’t a hostile and political act then listing them on a receipt for some crap you bought on Amazon isn’t, either. The only difference between the two is that Trump instituted these ludicrous taxes and doesn’t want to take the blame for them. \n\nSeriously, look at the glass menagerie of sniveling, groveling billionaires decorating Trump‘s cabinet—and White House more broadly. All that money and not an ounce of pride. While Bezos hold no official role in the administration, his businesses are deeply entwined with the government. To incur the president’s ire is to risk billions in Deep Blue contracts or Amazon storage contracts or unfavorable rulings on regulatory matters. But fighting back against bullies always entails risk. When Americans see those with the greatest ability to fight back failing to do so, it sends an unmistakable message: “We’re only in this for ourselves.”\n\nI know a line on a receipt is a small thing, but capitulation always starts small. With that small thing, Bezos has granted the President of the United States veto power over how he runs his business. Just like the Paramount CEO Shari Redstone, in accepting the resignation of longtime 60 Minutes producer Bill Owens last week, is agreeing to let Trump run hers. Just like Mark Zuckerberg is doing at Meta. \n\nThey probably think they’re just going along to get along. The oligarchs in Putin’s Russia surely thought the same thing, at least until they started falling out of windows. \n\nImagine what these rich guys could if they stood together on behalf of American democracy instead of accelerating its end. Imagine what devoting a tiny percentage of their wealth could do to preserve and repair our institutions rather than using that money to undermine and corrode them. Imagine what this nation could be if they even just agreed to pay their fair share of taxes. But they won’t. As a nation, I think we’ve come to expect nothing from our billionaires. I’m disappointed to report, yet again, we’ve gotten exactly what we expected.","summary":"Photo Illustration by Elizabeth Brockway/The Daily Beast/GettyYou ever rent a car? I do, all the time.

for the Democratic fundraising platform ActBlue have been summoned to appear before Congress amid a sweeping probe into potentially fraudulent — and even foreign-sourced — donations during the 2024 election, according to a pair of letters exclusively obtained by The Post.\n\nThe House Oversight, Judiciary and Administration Committees fired off letters to two employees of the AI-powered fraud prevention software firm Sift who worked with ActBlue — and reportedly know “critical” information about how the lead Dem funding portal adopted a “more lenient” standard for suspicious donations.\n\n“The Committees are concerned that ActBlue has maintained poor anti-fraud practices that may have allowed bad actors to make fraudulent political donations, including from foreign sources,” wrote Oversight Chairman James Comer (R-Ky.), Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) and Administration Chairman Bryan Steil (R-Wis.).\n\nThe letters were addressed to Sift’s director of customer success and senior customer success manager.\n\n“ActBlue is a safe and secure fundraising platform, trusted by donors for more than 20 years – that’s how we’ve become a vital part of American democracy,” a spokeswoman for the platform said in a statement responding to the letter.\n\n“This continued targeting of ActBlue and our partners by MAGA Republicans needs to be seen for what it is: Donald Trump’s latest front in his campaign to stamp out all political, electoral and ideological opposition.”\n\nReps for the fundraising platform did not respond to a follow-up question about whether CEO Regina Wallace-Jones was still employed, following several resignations by senior officials in late February.\n\nThe demands come after President Trump signed an executive order last Thursday authorizing Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate illicit “straw donors” or foreign funding in federal elections — in a memo that cited allegations of ActBlue allowing “dummy” accounts to contribute to Democratic causes.\n\nBondi is expected to whip up a report in the next 180 days on the matter, the memo noted.\n\nActBlue approved the relaxed standards for fraud during both former President Joe Biden’s and subsequently Vice President Kamala Harris’ bid to keep the White House, internal records previously obtained by The Post show.\n\nBut hundreds of dubious contributions — including ones from “foreign IP” addresses and others from donors of the opposite party — have been a cause of concern to the congressional investigators.\n\n“At best, ActBlue’s conduct displays a profound disrespect for the principle that only Americans should decide American elections,” the GOP committee staff declared in an interim report on the funding fiasco earlier this month.\n\n“At worst, it may violate the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA), which states that persons who ‘knowingly accept a contribution made by one person in the name of another person’ may face criminal liability.”\n\nThe lefty fundraising powerhouse didn’t require a card verification value (CVV) for debit, credit or prepaid gift card transactions until 2024 — and midway through the election year, ActBlue employees were instructed to “look for reasons to accept contributions.”\n\nBoth Trump and the House Republicans have maintained that their probes are consistent with GOP campaign pledges to secure America’s elections.\n\nActBlue has overseen $16 billion in contributions to Democratic campaigns and causes since 2004 — and helped boost Harris with $46.7 million in the days after Biden bowed out of the 2024 race.\n\nThe GOP chairs asked for the two Sift employees to schedule transcribed interviews with the House Judiciary panel by May 13.","summary":"ActBlue has overseen $16

The Holocaust Memorial Council oversees the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C. Most of the members of the council are appointed by the president and serve five-year terms. Emhoff, who is Jewish and is married to former Vice President Kamala Harris, was appointed to the council by former President Joe Biden. Along with Emhoff, the Trump administration also removed several other council members appointed by Biden, according to The Hill. After receiving news of his dismissal from the council, Emhoff took to social media to slam the administration, saying it was turning \"one of the worst atrocities in history into a wedge issue.\" MEDIA PERSONALITY STEVE HILTON UNLEASHES ON 'FAILED AND REJECTED' KAMALA HARRIS AT CAMPAIGN LAUNCH \"Today, I was informed of my removal from the United States Holocaust Memorial Council,\" he said. \"Let me be clear: Holocaust remembrance and education should never be politicized. To turn one of the worst atrocities in history into a wedge issue is dangerous – and it dishonors the memory of six million Jews murdered by Nazis that this museum was created to preserve.\" Emhoff said that despite his removal, he would continue to speak out against hate \"in all its forms.\" \"No divisive political decision will ever shake my commitment to Holocaust remembrance and education or combatting hate and antisemitism,\" he said, adding: \"I will continue to speak out, to educate, and to fight hate in all its forms – because silence is never an option.\" Emhoff has previously been criticized for getting basic facts wrong about the Jewish religion, such as the origin of one of its most significant feasts, Hanukkah. Meanwhile, both his wife and Biden took heavy criticism for not being more supportive of Israel and its war against Hamas after the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attacks. EX-VP HARRIS RETURNS TO POLITICS TO HEADLINE DNC FUNDRAISER WITH TICKETS STARTING AT $25,000 Emhoff has also accused President Donald Trump of being a \"threat\" to Jews. At a speech in Pittsburgh during the 2024 presidential campaign, Emhoff said: \"Whenever chaos and cruelty are given a green light, Jew-hatred is historically not far behind.\" He added, \"That matters today because Donald Trump is nothing if not an agent of chaos and cruelty.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In his first 100 days in office, however, Trump has made combating antisemitism, especially on college campuses, a major focus. Among other actions, the Trump Department of Homeland Security has arrested Hamas sympathizers on college campuses who they say pose a threat to national security. The administration has also moved to pull funding from universities, including Harvard, unless they reform their governing processes and change their international admissions processes to avoid admitting students who are \"hostile\" to American values or support terrorism or antisemitism. In response to a request for comment by Fox News Digital, a spokesperson for the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum said: \"At this time of high antisemitism and Holocaust distortion and denial, the Museum is gratified that our visitation is robust and demand for Holocaust education is increasing.\" The representative added, \"We look forward to continuing to advance our vitally important mission as we work with the Trump Administration.\" Fox News Digital's Rachel Wolf, Morgan Phillips and Louis Casiano contributed to this report.","summary":"Former Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff lashed out at the Trump administration, accusing it of politicizing the Holocaust and dishonoring the memory of six million murdered Jews after he was removed from the United States Holocaust Memorial Council.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doug-emhoff-lashes-out-after-trump-removes-him-from-holocaust-memorial-council","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/01/931/523/doug-emhoff-kamala-harris.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-29 22:13:14","author":"Peter Pinedo","authors":["Peter Pinedo"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.006},{"id":316197088,"title":"President Trump takes stage in Metro Detroit for 100th day rally","text":"WARREN, MI — At his first Michigan-based rally since November, President Donald Trump has taken the stage in front of a crowd of hundreds at the Macomb Community College gym.\n\nThe president last week announced plans to visit the college as a “celebration” of the first 100 days of his second term in the White House.\n\nHis Tuesday, April 29, appearance at the college marked the second of two planned stops in Michigan, a swing-state where voters last November favored the Republican over Democrat Kamala Harris.

Gretchen Whitmer, who earlier this month visited the White House to discuss the proposal to put the fighter jets at Selfridge, lauded the annoucement.\n\nThe Michigan trip marks Trump’s third visit to Macomb Community College in the last eight months. \n\nDuring a busy campaign season in Michigan for the Republican, the school hosted one of the Republican candidate’s last stops: A Nov. 1 rally, four days before Election Day.\n\nIn September, he hosted a roundtable-style gathering at the college, located about 20 miles north of downtown Detroit.\n\nRELATED: Why Trump’s 100th-day ‘celebration’ in Michigan has political experts raising eyebrows\n\nApril 29 marks Trump’s 99th day since returning to the White House on Jan. 20.\n\nTrump in November 2024 won Michigan’s 15 electoral college votes, flipping the state again in a victory over Democrat Kamala Harris.\n\nMacomb County was one of the southeast Michigan communities where voters favored Trump.\n\nThere, voters chose Trump over Harris, 284,660 votes to 214,977 votes, for a nearly 14-percentage point victory margin.\n\nTrump in 2016 was the first Republican to win Michigan’s vote since 1988. With his victory last year, he added to that bragging right.\n\nTrump’s favor in Michigan has wavered over the years, but his supporters have kept the vote counts close. He defeated Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton by 10,704 Michigan votes in 2016 and then lost to Democratic nominee Joe Biden by 154,188 Michigan votes four years later.\n\nTrump defeated Harris by 80,103 Michigan votes last November.\n\nIn the nearly 100 days since he returned to the White House, Trump has signed a series of executive orders and outlined other policy initiatives that immediately impacted Americans.\n\nThe president’s activity seemingly has not slowed since then, with each week delivering new issues and new understandings of how Trump’s administration influences American law and culture, including in Michigan.\n\nClick here to follow MLive’s complete coverage of President Trump’s impact on Michigan.","summary":"The trip marks Trump’s third visit to Macomb Community College in the last eight months, although the previous two trips were as a presidential candidate.","url":"https://www.mlive.com/politics/2025/04/president-trump-takes-stage-in-metro-detroit-for-100th-day-rally.html","image":"https://www.mlive.com/resizer/v2/6UV2J5OGXJCXNHHAX7KB7WD23I.jpg?auth=2046cd73dcbf1092a3245bb322664c3f7cdce2fef25d25d995aa29215e5a06b5&width=1280&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-29 22:00:48","author":"Justin Engel","authors":["Justin Engel"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.175},{"id":316203456,"title":"Trump SIDELINES ‘Fake News Thugs’ David Muir and George Stephanopoulos For Primetime Sit-Down Interview","text":"ABC News may have locked down a big-time interview with Donald Trump, but don't expect to see David Muir or George Stephanopoulos at the helm due to their nasty history with the president.\n\nWhile Trump is all about doing an interview marking 100 days in the White House, sources claim he wants nothing to do with the ABC World News Tonight anchor or the chief political correspondent, RadarOnline.com can reveal.“It’s nuts that it’s not Muir. And giving it to someone that people have barely heard of? A primetime exclusive with the president?” a source told PageSix, referring to ABC’s senior national correspondent Terry Moran, who will be the one running Trump's interview on Tuesday, April 29.\n\nTrump has been sick over Muir ever since September 2024, following his debate against Kamala Harris, which Muir moderated alongside Linsey Davis.\n\nThe co-hosts memorably fact-checked Trump and were accused of handing out soft questions to Harris, but going hard at the 78-year-old.The former reality star raged the debate was \"one against three,\" and insulted Muir many times calling him \"not legit,\" a \"real lightweight,\" and of course, his favorite, \"fake news.\"\n\nTrump, not surprisingly, even tossed a schoolyard insult, claiming Muir's \"hair was better five years ago.\" Following his election win, Trump once again cried about Muir, alleging that the anchor had misstated crime statistics when fact-checking him.\n\nMeanwhile, the controversial politician and Stephanopoulos have never seen eye-to-eye it seems.Back in May 2024, after ABC News President Kim Goodwin stepped down from her position, Trump rejoiced on social media: \"Happy to report that Kim Godwin, Head of ABC, has resigned. \n\n\"Could it be the unfair reporting on EVERYTHING TRUMP? In any event, GOOD RIDDANCE! Hopefully, somebody else will be able to control George Slopadopolous and the rest of the Fake News Thugs over at ABC? Best wishes Kim!\"\n\nThe duo's relationship got sour following a 2016 interview, as Trump yelled at Stephanopoulos for asking him questions about Russia.In December 2024, ABC and Trump agreed to a settlement, after Trump filed a lawsuit when Stephanopoulos said he was found liable of rape during a segment on This Week months earlier.\n\nThe network was accused of bowing down to Trump with the settlement, and despite Stephanopoulos defending his remarks – claiming he would not be \"cowed out of doing\" his job \"because of a threat\" – ABC News agreed to make a $15million payment to Trump's presidential foundation at the time.\n\nStephanopoulos' comments came after E. Jean Carroll accused Trump of raping her in a New York City department store dressing room in 1996.\n\nA Manhattan jury found Trump liable of sexually abusing the former columnist and awarded Carroll $5million.However, Stephanopoulos not only had issues with Trump, but also with Joe Biden, after the 64-year-old was caught on camera saying he did not think then-president Biden could serve out a second term.\n\nRadarOnline.com previously learned Debra OConnell, the president of the news division, had a meeting with Stephanopoulos following his comments.\n\nA source told us at the time: “This was a fully-fledged crisis and it exploded with far-reaching reverberations.\"The insider added OConnell told Stephanopoulos: “In no uncertain terms that he is a newsman who is expected to be objective.\n\n“She was furious that someone of George’s experience and status would compromise the news division’s impartiality, and subject it to unnecessary and embarrassing headlines.”\n\n\"George backed Debra into a corner. If he did not apologize, how could he continue with his duties at ABC News without the network facing an avalanche of criticism,\" the source said at the time.The seasoned anchor ended up apologizing for his comments in a statement.","summary":"Donald Trump did not wanted to be interviewed by David Muir or George Stephanopoulos for his prime-time interview, following his rough past with the anchors.","url":"https://radaronline.com/p/trump-david-muir-george-stephanopoulos-primetime-interview-fake/","image":"https://media.radaronline.com/brand-img/_98vThs_7/0x0/donald-trump-david-muir-george-stephanopolous-pp-1745952854977.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-29 22:00:00","author":"Bryan Brunati","authors":["Bryan Brunati"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.221},{"id":316187318,"title":"Harrowing new detail in Gene Hackman wife's autopsy revealed after she was killed by rat-borne virus","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTuesday, Apr 29th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrince William and Kate Middleton share tender moment in new photo to mark 14 years of marriage\n\nControversial Irish rappers Kneecap DROPPED from top music festival after they told cheering concert-goers to 'kill your local MP' - as pressure mounts for Glastonbury to axe them from its line-up\n\nImmigration judges accused of pushing 'activist' views and 'backing open borders' in potential breach of impartiality rules - including one who works for charity which helps Channel migrants\n\nTruth about £1million YouTubers Jonathan Joly and Anna Saccone and trans daughter they're accused of exploiting as they creep back from deleting 3,000 videos\n\nSARAH VINE: The Queen asked just ONE thing of Harry and Meghan.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy EVE BUCKLAND and BRITTANY CHAIN FOR DAILYMAIL.COM \n Published:22:14 BST, 29 April 2025 |Updated:22:57 BST, 29 April 2025 \n\nHarrowing new details have emerged from Gene Hackman's wife's autopsy after she died from a rat-borne virus.\nLegendary actor Hackman, 95, and classical pianist wife Betsy Arakawa, 65, were found dead and partially mummified in their Santa Fe mansion on February 26 2025.\nAfter much speculation, it was revealed Arakawa had died from Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS) in their bathroom days before Hackman passed.\nArakawa also had fluid accumulation in her chest and mild hardening of the vessels that supplied blood to the heart and body at the time of her death, per her autopsy report obtained by The Associated Press.\nArakawa tested negative for COVID-19 and the flu and showed no signs of trauma.\nShe tested positive for caffeine and negative for alcohol and intoxicating drugs.\nHer carbon monoxide levels were within a normal range. \n\nHarrowing new details have emerged from Gene Hackman's wife's autopsy after she died from a rat-borne virus; pictured together in 2003 in Beverly Hills\nThe final autopsy results for Hackman detailed the beloved Oscar winning actor's extensive medical history two months after he and his wife were found dead inside their home.\nHackman had 'a 'history of congestive heart failure' and 'severe chronic hypertensive changes, kidneys,' Fox reported, citing the Office of the Medical Investigator in New Mexico.\nHe had a 'bi-ventricular pacemaker' since April 2019 and 'neurodegenerative features consistent with Alzheimer's Disease,' according to the autopsy.\n'Autopsy showed severe atherosclerotic and hypertensive cardiovascular disease, with placement of coronary artery stents and a bypass graft, as well as a previous aortic valve replacement,' the documents stated.\n'Remote myocardial infarctions were present involving the left ventricular free wall and the septum, which were significantly large. Examination of the brain showed microscopic findings of advanced stage Alzheimer's disease.'\nHackman tested negative for Hantavirus.\nPolice have since determined that Arakawa died first around February 12 as a result of respiratory symptoms caused by the rare but deadly virus, which is passed on through rodent urine, saliva and feces. She was 65.\nA report obtained by DailyMail.com indicated that Arakawa had bookmarks on her computer suggesting that she had been researching medical conditions with symptoms similar to Covid-19 or the flu prior to her death.\n\nBody cam footage of police arriving at the couple's mansion was also revealed after a court order\n\n'Testing for carbon monoxide was less than 5 percent saturation, in keeping with a normal range,' the medical examiner noted.\nHackman also had trace amounts of acetone in his system at the time of his death, which could be a product of 'diabetic- and fasting-induced ketoacidosis.'\nHackman, who was suffering from advanced Alzheimer's disease at the time, is believed to have wandered around the couple's home alone after his wife's death.\nDue to the advanced condition, he may not have ever realized his wife had died. \nThe actor died nearly a week later around February 18, from severe heart disease, while Alzheimer's and kidney disease were contributing factors. \nA week after the bodies were discovered, the New Mexico Department of Public Health conducted a health assessment on the property.\nThe department concluded that dead rodents and their nests were found in 'eight detached outbuildings' on the Hackman property, making it a 'breeding ground' for the hantavirus. \n\nMedication was found strewn around the home when authorities arrived\n\nA week after the bodies were discovered, the New Mexico Department of Public Health conducted a health assessment on the property. The department concluded that dead rodents and their nests were found in 'eight detached outbuildings' on the Hackman property, making it a 'breeding ground' for the hantavirus\n\nPolice have since determined that Arakawa died first around February 12\n\n Warning to millions over rodent disease that killed Gene Hackman's wife \nThe deadly hantavirus typically spreads through rodent urine and droppings that one may come into contact with when cleaning a basement or an attic.\nThere were droppings found in three garages, two casitas, and three sheds on the property.\nAdditionally, there was a live rodent, a dead rodent and a rodent nest found in three more garages on the property, according to the inspectors.\nThere were also two vehicles seen on the estate that had evidence of rodents, and they even found traps in the buildings as well, suggesting this had been an ongoing issue for the Hackmans.\nThe health assessment was conducted to assess whether first responders or others who were on the property were safe from the virus.\nCops who combed their home following the gruesome discovery shared bodycam footage which captured how the couple's other heartbroken dog watched over Betsy's lifeless body as it lay surrounded by clutter. \nA series of heartbreaking notes were also found dotted around the house, each exchanged between the couple and showing their affection for one another until the end.\nPhotos of their adored German Shepherds also adorned tables and sideboards, with smiling pictures of the couple with their old pets dating back years. \nGene Hackman\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nHarrowing new detail in Gene Hackman wife's autopsy revealed after she was killed by rat-borne virus\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 11\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

To turn one of the worst atrocities in history into a wedge issue is dangerous — and it dishonors the memory of six million Jews murdered by Nazis that this museum was created to preserve.”\n\nEmhoff — who is Jewish and served on former President Joe Biden’s White House antisemitism task force after a startling rise in the scourge after the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel — was appointed to the board in January and was slated to serve a five-year term. \n\nRon Klain, Biden’s former chief of staff; Tom Perez, a former Biden White House adviser; Anthony Bernal, an ex-adviser to former first lady Jill Biden; and Susan Rice, national security adviser to former President Barack Obama, were also recently ousted from the Holocaust museum board, a White House official confirmed. \n\nThe New York Times first reported on the firings. \n\n“On behalf of President Donald J. Trump, I am writing to inform you that your position as a member of the United States Holocaust Memorial Council is terminated, effective immediately,” read an email from the White House Presidential Personnel Office, informing the board members of their removal, according to the outlet. \n\n“Thank you for your service.”\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told The Post that Trump is aiming to replace the ousted board members with stronger supporters of Israel. \n\n“President Trump looks forward to appointing new individuals who will not only continue to honor the memory of those who perished in the Holocaust, but who are also steadfast supporters of the State of Israel,” she said in a statement.","summary":"Emhoff, the husband of former Vice President Kamala Harris, was among several Biden administration appointments to the board removed by President Trump. ","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/04/29/us-news/trump-fires-kamala-harris-husband-doug-emhoff-from-holocaust-museum-board/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/newspress-collage-wgx8rlaqi-1745962678548.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1745948306&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-29 21:55:08","author":"Victor Nava","authors":["Victor Nava"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":0.088},{"id":316201408,"title":"The Polls Are Sending Trump a Message","text":"“People are very happy with this presidency,” President Donald Trump said in an interview with The Atlantic last week. “I’ve had great polls.”\n\nThat wasn’t true then, and it’s even less true now. As Trump hits his 100th day in office today, pollsters have been releasing new surveys, and the results are ugly. NBC News finds that 55 percent of Americans disapprove of the president’s handling of the job, but that’s rosy compared with the 59 percent in a CNN poll. An ABC News/Washington Post poll finds that just 39 percent of Americans approve of Trump’s performance—the lowest ever recorded, going back to 1945, and smashing through the previous record of 42 percent, set by one Donald Trump in 2017.\n\nMore than half of Americans say that Trump is a “dangerous dictator whose power should be limited before he destroys American democracy,” according to the Public Religion Research Institute. Asked by NPR to give Trump a letter grade for his first 100 days, a full 45 percent of Americans gave the president an F, including 49 percent of independents. Sixty percent believe that the country is on the wrong track, per NBC.\n\nThese numbers also extend into specific issues. Immigration is historically one of Trump’s strongest issues, but the ABC/Post poll finds that more voters now disapprove of his handling than approve. The economy was perhaps the decisive issue in November, but now fewer than four in 10 people approve of Trump’s handling, according to NPR. Relatedly, consumer confidence is at its worst level since the early weeks of the coronavirus pandemic. Trump has frequently promised a historic presidency, and he’s delivering it.\n\nOne temptation, when looking at these numbers, is to say they don’t matter. Plenty of people, including the staff of this magazine, warned about how a second Trump presidency might go wrong, and a plurality of people who voted backed Trump anyway, and the only poll that matters (as the saying goes) is the one on Election Day. Trump has power now, and he’s wielding it. This is especially the case because Trump has shown less responsiveness to indicators like the stock market than he has in the past; notwithstanding his quasi-jokes about seeking a third term, he’s acting freed from the pressures of reelection.\n\nThat’s all true, but it’s not the whole truth. An unpopular president is a less powerful president. Enacting an authoritarian approach is harder (though not impossible) without public support, and other institutions—the Republican Party, universities, law firms—are less likely to bend their knee if they see weakness.\n\nOne way you can tell these polls have some effect is that Trump is lashing out furiously about them. Yesterday, he posted on Truth Social that these were “FAKE POLLS FROM FAKE NEWS ORGANIZATIONS,” adding that they “should be investigated for ELECTION FRAUD … AND ARE TRULY THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!” (Trump attributed his analysis to his pollster, John McLaughlin, best known for missing the massive upset defeat of his client Eric Cantor in 2014.) This is not Trump’s first such broadside. He has also sued the pollster J. Ann Selzer, who released a poll late in the election cycle showing Kamala Harris slightly ahead in Iowa. Selzer’s poll created a frenzy, but it turned out to be badly wrong—which one might think is punishment enough. (Legal experts are skeptical of Trump’s suit.)\n\nSkepticism of pollsters is not unwarranted. Polling has had some atrocious recent misses, though the final 2024 results closely tracked with the polls at the end of the race. As the strategist Michael Podhorzer has written, pollsters present their work as empirical, but polling is actually opinion journalism—not in the sense that it is partisan, but because it’s premised on suppositions about the electorate such as how many young voters will turn out, and how many voters with less than a college degree. Some of those suppositions inevitably turn out to be more accurate than others. One thing that makes the results I cite here more credible is that they are all moving in the same general direction. Can they tell us what percentage of the population actually disapproves of Trump? Not reliably. But taken together, they tell a consistent story, which also matches up with a raft of worrisome economic indicators that are darkening Americans’ outlook.\n\nThe funny thing about Trump’s anger at polling errors is that, if anything, their tendency to underestimate his support has benefited him. In 2016, Trump was able to capitalize in part on voter apathy, fed by an expectation that Hillary Clinton would triumph. More important, then–FBI Director James Comey later said his decision to announce a reopening of the investigation into Clinton’s email in October 2016 was influenced by his poll-driven assumption that Clinton would win in a walk. Instead, the analyst Nate Silver calculated, the announcement cost her the election. Eight years later, unrealistically rosy polling convinced Democrats that President Joe Biden was competitive in his reelection bid against Trump, which allowed him to enter and then stay in the race far too long. Unfortunately for Trump, he’s unlikely to enjoy similar polling errors outside of the head-to-head-context of an election. Issue polls are more consistent in sussing out how sentiment is changing.\n\nTrump’s impulse is always to shoot the messenger, but the messenger isn’t Trump’s problem here. It’s the message that voters are sending him.\n\nHere are three new stories from The Atlantic:\n\nToday’s News\n\nEvening Read\n\nThe Great Language Flattening\n\nBy Victoria Turk\n\nMore From The Atlantic\n\nCulture Break\n\nExamine.

John Kennedy, R-La., said he found it hard to find any other explanation for adding the costs of the tariffs by the online commerce behemoth than playing politics. \n\n“Well, when they first announced that they were going to show the cost, I’m sure a charitable interpretation existed, but I just couldn’t find it,” Kennedy told The Daily Signal. \n\n“My thought immediately was, if [Amazon chief Jeff] Bezos is going to play politics and list the extra costs of the tariffs, then he ought to go back and for each product, compute the added cost of [former President Joe] Biden’s inflation,” the Louisiana senator said. \n\n“Somebody probably pointed that out to him, and he changed his mind,” Kennedy concluded. \n\nLeavitt told reporters that she had a phone call with President Donald Trump about the report. Bezos, who also owns The Washington Post, prevented the paper’s editorial board from endorsing then-Vice President Kamala Harris during the 2024 presidential election. After Trump’s victory in November, he joined a parade of tech titans and world leaders in dining with the then president-elect at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. \n\nBezos was also one of a bevy of tech leaders who were guests at Trump’s inauguration, for which Amazon donated $1 million. The president reportedly called Bezos on Tuesday to ask about the news report. \n\nAmazon’s corporate policy has also sought to appease the president and his allies. The online retailer reversed a lengthy ban on a book critical of the transgender movement.\n\nAt the Tuesday press conference, the White House press secretary noted that the company had agreed to censor comments and reviews related to Chinese President Xi Jinping in the past, describing Amazon’s actions as having “partnered with a Chinese propaganda arm.” \n\nAmazon said in a statement that “the team that runs our ultralow cost Amazon Haul store considered the idea of listing import charges on certain products.” \n\nHowever, that policy for Haul, a spinoff website of the company that promotes products that cost $20 or less, was never implemented. The statement appeared to definitively close the door on the idea.\n\n“This was never approved and is not going to happen.” the statement said.\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said at a press conference on Tuesday that the issue would have to be “a conversation that folks at Amazon will have to have with the White House.” \n\n“You know, I think at the end of the day, again, this administration will be judged by the results that they get,” Thune said. \n\nThe South Dakota senator expressed confidence in the president’s decisions.\n\n“I don’t for a minute believe that this administration isn’t making the right decisions that leads [sic] to the policy outcomes that are going to make the American people … more safe, more secure, and more economically prosperous,” Thune said.","summary":"Amazon said Tuesday it would not be displaying the cost of tariffs right next to products’ total prices on any of the company’s websites, contrary...

I'm really struggling.\" And Joe hears that and he wants to support me but he'll do other things that aren't the stuff I'm asking him.\n'He gets frustrated because he has worked hard and he has put the effort in.

You're a great dad and an amazing person, but sometimes I don't think you take into consideration all the fires I've got to put out everywhere.'\nLooking defeated, Joe replied: 'I don't even know what to say. It's so frustrating, when all I feel like I'm doing is trying to dedicate myself to my family and do everything I possibly can, every minute of the day. \n'And then to sit here and listen to the fact that I'm a huge problem...'\n'But nobody is saying that.

I'm here to support who we are.'\nIn a previous episode of their reality show, Joe opened up about his ongoing struggles with ADHD.\nHe said: 'Being a kid, I don't think ADHD back then was even recognised, so I had ADHD and a touch of dyslexia, so I really got tarred with the brush of being a naughty kid.\n'I feel like I sort of invented this character to sort of protect myself a little bit, just making people laugh.'\nDuring a candid scene in the couple's kitchen Joe reflected on experiences throughout his life, recalled: 'When I was a kid and when I was at school, I wasn't a bad person, I wasn't a bad boy.\n'I was just misunderstood and I always had to pay the consequences for it because no one understood that it was coming from a different place,' Joe revealed.\nStacey shared that she had been researching counselling options to help her husband, while Joe met with a psychiatrist and decided to look into medication too.\nLooking back at his appointment, Joe shared: 'It was nice to speak to him, because he understands the ins and outs of what's going on.\n\nIn a previous episode of their reality show, Joe opened up about his ongoing struggles with ADHD\n\n'It's opened up a little box of worms for me where it goes a little bit deeper than I thought it would go.'\nHe appeared to tear up as Stacey commented: 'I do know what you mean, and I do understand and I know that's hard to revisit and I know that's difficult to think about but ultimately you're a good person Joe and you're not able to be your best self at the moment.\n'You don't deserve that to be happening to you at this point in your life, you've worked too hard, you've given too much love to your family.\n'This is about getting back on your feet and staying consistently in a place where you feel comfortable, safe, loved. Do it for yourself, you deserve better than how you've been living, Joe.'\nJoe wiped away tears and Stacey supportively embraced him before adding: 'I love you.'\nStacey And Joe airs on BBC One and is available to stream on iPlayer. \nJoe SwashStacey SolomonBBC\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nJoe Swash admits he feels like a 'problem' in wife Stacey Solomon's 'perfect' life due to his ADHD as they lay bare marriage difficulties during couple's therapy\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

You can ask Molly this yourself. It was the drink, and the drink is not a good thing.'\nTommy FuryMolly Mae Hague\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nMolly-Mae Hague shares heartfelt tribute to lookalike sister on her birthday after Zoe questioned if she has 'addressed the problems' amid Tommy Fury romance reconciliation\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy SHARON MAI FOR DAILYMAIL.COM \n Published:21:59 BST, 29 April 2025 |Updated:22:26 BST, 29 April 2025 \n\nBlake Lively's friendship with her longtime best friend Gigi Hadid is under question after she skipped her 30th birthday party.\nOn Friday, the supermodel rang in her birthday with many of her celebrity pals but her close friends Lively and Ryan Reynolds were noticeably absent. \nHadid celebrated her birthday at Saks Fifth Avenue in New York City alongside her boyfriend Bradley Cooper and a slew of other stars, but not her best friend of approximately a decade.\nShe celebrated alongside her sister Bella Hadid and their parents Yolanda and Mohammed, and the guest list also featured many supermodels and actress Anne Hathaway.\nAnd Taylor Swift reportedly snuck into Hadid's star-studded soirée without Travis Kelce by her side, according to gossip site DeuxMoi.\nTwo days later, journalist Kjersti Flaa, who claimed she was bullied by the actress in a resurfaced video from 2016, reacted to Lively and Reynolds' lack of attendance at Hadid's birthday party on her podcast Flaawsome Talk.\n\nBlake Lively 's friendship with her longtime BFF Gigi Hadid is under question after she skipped her 30th birthday party; pictured July 2024 in New York City\n\nLast Friday, the supermodel rang in her birthday with many of her celebrity pals but her close friends Lively and Ryan Reynolds were noticeably absent; pictured October 2017 in New York City\n\nFlaa expressed shock that Lively did not help her friend celebrate what she noted was a very important occasion and milestone birthday — especially after their big appearance together at the Deadpool & Wolverine premiere and many more industry events. \nLively later opted to fly to Wales instead for a soccer match and to cheer on Reynolds' UK team Wrexham AFC.\nBased on Lively's attendance at the TIME100 Gala in New York City with her mother and Reynolds the day before, Flaa speculated that their reason for not going to Hadid's party could not be due to being out of town or them not wanting to go out. \n\n Blake Lively mercilessly mocked over VERY awkward wardrobe malfunction at premiere \nFlaa further speculated that Hadid and Cooper did not invite the couple as they 'probably waiting to be subpoenaed' in the ongoing legal battle between Lively and Justin Baldoni. \nOn February 5, 2025, Baldoni's attorney Bryan Freedman shared a statement via TMZ: 'Anyone that reasonably has information that can provide evidence in this case is going to be deposed.' \nSwift is reportedly set to be subpoenaed this week. \nFlaa claimed that Hadid and Cooper appear to have been a little involved, but involved nonetheless, in It Ends With Us, and for that reason, they could dragged into the legal drama and be summoned to court.\nHadid previously gushed about the movie at the premiere, hinting at the fact that she was invited to a pre-screening at Lively's penthouse, which No Filter podcast host Zack Peter previously speculated. \n\nHadid celebrated her birthday at Saks Fifth Avenue in New York City alongside her boyfriend Bradley Cooper and a slew of other stars — but not with her best friends of approximately a decade\n\nTwo days later, journalist Kjersti Flaa, who claimed she was bullied by the actress in a resurfaced video from 2016, reacted to Lively and Reynolds' lack of attendance at Hadid's birthday party on her podcast; pictured May 2018 in New York City\n\nBased on Lively's attendance at the TIME100 Gala in New York City with her mother and Reynolds the day before, Flaa speculated that their reason for not going to Hadid's party could not be due to being out of town or them not wanting to go out\n\nShe expressed shock that Lively did not help her friend celebrate her milestone birthday — and later opted to fly to Wales with Reynolds instead for his team's soccer match;

pictured January 2024 in Beverly Hills\n\nLast December, Lively filed a lawsuit against Baldoni, accusing him of sexual harassment and creating a 'hostile work environment on set.' Baldoni, 41, retaliated with his own $400 million filing \n\nLast December, Lively filed a lawsuit against Baldoni, accusing him of sexual harassment and creating a 'hostile work environment on set.' \nBaldoni, 41, retaliated with his own $400 million filing against the actress as well as her husband Reynolds as he accused the couple of trying to tarnish his reputation. \nThe bitter back-and-forth is scheduled for a trial on March 29, 2026. \nAll parties have denied the allegations. \nTaylor SwiftGigi HadidRyan Reynolds\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nBlake Lively's friendship with longtime pal Gigi Hadid is questioned after skipping her 30th birthday party\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy AMELIA WYNNE FOR MAILONLINE \n Published:22:00 BST, 29 April 2025 |Updated:22:20 BST, 29 April 2025 \n\nThe Spice Girls are reportedly set to reunite to mark their 30th anniversary as they have been secretly planning an upcoming world tour.\nGeri Halliwell, Emma Bunton, Mel B and Mel C are said to be meeting next week in Miami to discuss the finer details.\nThe Sun reports that Victoria Beckham, 51, however is '90 per cent out of the running', with the foursome pushing ahead with plans without her for now.\nGeri and band manager and guru Simon Fuller are reportedly in touch again which has moved things along after years of hints from various members that they would get back together.\nA source told the publication: 'There have been rumours swirling for months, but Geri has always been too busy and had other things on, preventing her from saying yes.\n'Nothing is yet confirmed but Geri and Simon are back in touch with a myriad of exciting ideas. \n\nThe Spice Girls are reportedly set to reunite to mark their 30th anniversary as they have been secretly planning an upcoming world tour (seen in 1996) \n\nGeri Halliwell, Emma Bunton, Mel B and Mel C are said to be meeting next week in Miami to discuss the finer details\n'Unfortunately Victoria has pretty much ruled herself out, but there is still a world in which she could do some sort of avatar appearance or a special one-off thing. She would always want to honour the girls' history.'\n'If Simon were to get involved, this would absolutely take any tour to the next level.' \nGeri will be in Miami later this week to support her F1 boss husband Christian Horner at the Grand Prix and Simon will also be there.\nRepresentatives for the women have been contacted by MailOnline for comment. \nIt comes as also on Tuesday Richard Branson spoke about how the band were meant to reunite just before Covid for an event on one of his Virgin Voyages.\nHe said at the launch of Virgin Hotels London-Shoreditch: 'The last time the Spice Girls were going to do something for Virgin, we had our first cruise ship at Dover. They were coming to launch the ship. They didn't turn up! I rang one of them, said: 'Where are you?!'\n'She said: 'They said there's something called Covid on cruise ships. We've been advised not to come. I said: 'What's Covid?! Don't be stupid! Get on down here!'\n'They said: 'No, no, there are cruise ships stuck at sea with Covid!' Anyway, that was my first sign that we had big troubles to come! Anyway… they owe us one!'\nJust last month Geri dropped the biggest hint yet that the Spice Girls are set to reunite.\n\nThe Sun reports that Victoria Beckham, 51, however is '90 per cent out of the running', with the foursome pushing ahead with plans without her for now\n\nJust last month Geri dropped the biggest hint yet that the Spice Girls (seen in the 90s) are set to reunite \nThe singer 52, formed the band in 1994 with Mel B, Mel C, Emma and Victoria.\nSince they officially broke up they there have been various rumours that they would reunite - with Mel B recently sharing her enthusiasm again for another tour.\nAnd now Geri has said in an interview that there is hope for this - despite reports over the years that she doesn't get on with Mel B. \nShe told The Times: 'My hope is we come back together as a collective. It's more respectful to come as one.\n'There will be something. We'll come as one. We love each other. I love them, I care about them, we want the best for each other.\n'We shared something so monumental. We've always believed in each other, had trust in each other, which is beautiful.'\nShe also confirmed that the five of them do have a group chat but wouldn't reveal the name of it. \nIt comes after fellow Spice Girl Mel C hinted that the band could do something special next year to mark the 30-year anniversary of their debut album, Spice.\nThe girl group last toured together in 2020 as a foursome, with only Victoria missing out.\nWhile the last time Emma, Mel B, Mel C, Victoria and Geri all performed as a five was during the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics. \nSpeaking to Rebecca Judd On Apple Music 1 in March, Mel C teased: 'There has to be something befitting of 30 years since Wannabe. \n\nThe last time Emma, Mel B, Mel C, Victoria and Geri all performed as a five was during the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics\n'Once a Spice Girl, always a Spice Girl. \n'We all feel like that, but we now are getting together because we know if we're going to do anything, we have to start planning things to get things right.\n'We have to start making the plans right now and putting them into action. So fingers crossed.'\nHowever, she admitted it might be up to her and Mel B to get things moving, saying: 'I think me and Mel B are probably going to be going in there all guns blazing, 'Come on! It's time!''\n\n Mel B rocks a bold blue tracksuit as she departs BBC Breakfast after revealing surprise diagnosis \nIt came as good news to the nineties band's fans, after hopes of another reformation were thought to have been have been scuppered due to an ugly feud between two members.\nReports emerged in November that Geri backed out of a huge Netflix biopic that would have netted each of the five members £1million each.\nAccording to The Sun, the streaming service had told the band to make up or it would make the show without any input from the people featured in it, much like controversial drama The Crown.\nA source said: 'Executives are keen to have all the group on board providing as much input as possible - after all they are pop royalty. \n'But Netflix are the organisation who defied the wishes of real royalty and went ahead and made The Crown, so they aren't afraid to go it alone when they have to.\n\nThey then had a sing song at Victoria's 50th birthday party last year \n'The project is in its very early stages so there's plenty of time to get all five Spice Girls involved.\nIn November, Geri's husband Christian Horner was forced to deny claims he was to blame for 'derailing' the band's TV project.\nHe told the PA news agency: 'There is a lot being written about different things, but there are absolutely no plans to do a family documentary.\n'Netflix do enough, and you see enough of the behind-the-scenes on that. So where that report has come from, I have absolutely no idea.'\nMel BChristian HornerEmma Bunton\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nSpice Girls 'will FINALLY reunite as they secretly plan world tour after years of hints - but one key star will be missing from the band'\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 32\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Me and Jack are having a baby! Due November 2025, we can't wait to welcome this little one into the world and embrace all the joy and love he or she will bring'.\n'I still can't believe I've finally got everything I ever wanted and i couldn't be more grateful…And just like that 2 are about to become 3.'\nGeorgia opened up about the pregnancy in an interview with Ok! Magazine and The Daily Mirror.\nShe told the publication: 'When you know, you know. I know it’s cringey but that’s definitely how we feel. Anyone who knows us knows how strong we are, and how happy we make each other.\n'We both definitely wanted children, and while some may say it feels too soon, we know that this is amazing news and we couldn’t be happier.'\nGeorgia added: 'If we’re lucky enough to be able to have kids, why not have them sooner rather than later?'\nShe explained that the couple have 'lived' and 'partied' so much, that they're ready to settle down and start their family. \nGeorgia and Jack met on a dating app ten months ago and are now living together in Essex as they prepare to become parents.\n\nShe was seen pulling up the zip of the purple jacket worn over a matching sports bra and struggled to get it over her bust\n\nReality star Georgia added in the caption: 'By far my biggest give away in the first trimester!'\n\nShe looked great in her fitness gear in the clip which was taken much earlier in her pregnancy\n\nGeorgia, 30, shared a glimpse of her blossoming baby bump for the first time amid a sun-soaked getaway on Monday \n\nThe stunner announced her happy news via Instagram on Saturday after a whirlwind ten-month romance with Jack, 33 \nIn the interview, she revealed that it was the first time she had ever used a dating app, and Jack had never seen any of her shows prior to their first date.\nIn January, Georgia revealed her hunky boyfriend on Instagram for the first time, sharing a gallery of loved-up snaps of the pair on holiday in Columbia. \nThe reality TV star revealed in October that she had sparked up a relationship with someone who is not in the public eye.\nPreviously Georgia, who found love again eight months after dating Anton Danyluk on Love Island All Stars, had kept her new man's identity covered as she posed for photos hiding his face.\n\n Georgia Harrison wows in a skimpy bikini as she cosies up to boyfriend Jack at the beach in Dubai \nDiscussing her new man, she previously told The Sun that he is 'out of the public eye', explaining: 'It's really refreshing and he's very grounded.'\n'It's not something I've been shouting from the rooftops yet but it's going really, really well, and I'm really enjoying my time with him.'\nAdding that she feels she can be 'completely and utterly myself' when she's around him, Georgia concluded: 'For the first time in a while, I've met someone that I do think is a really good person and I enjoy being around.' \nIn March, Georgia opened up about how her new romance with City worker Jack has been helping her learn to trust again.\nThe reality star famously dated Celebrity Big Brother winner Stephen Bear, but was left devastated after he secretly filmed them during an intimate moment and shared the video online.\nAfter being found guilty of voyeurism and two counts of disclosing private, sexual photos and films, Georgia's ex Bear was sentenced to 21 months in prison in March 2023. He was released in January.\nGeorgia told The Sun that the ordeal almost broke her - however meeting her boyfriend Jack, 32, last July has helped her begin the process of healing.\n\n'I've never felt so safe,' she said, as she revealed that Jack has no connection to the showbiz world - nor any desire to.\nGeorgia said that Jack has been a huge support to her through her activism after she became a political campaigner to fight revenge porn incidents.\n'He takes it all with a pinch of salt - he's not a bit interested in fame but he supports me, it doesn't scare him,' she said.\n'Jack's been so supportive, he's so proud. He's told everyone about it. I've been through a lot but it all led me to meeting him. He's my biggest supporter.\nGeorgia's last known relationship was a brief fling with Anton Danyluk, whom she met on Love Island: All Stars in January. They split in April.\nPrior to that, she admitted that she had also dated Jake McLean, who died in a car accident in 2022.\nGeorgia's friends and fellow Love Islanders rushed to the comments of her Instagram announcement to share their congratulations.\n\nShe told followers: 'We've been keeping a secret! Me and Jack are having a baby! Due November 2025' \nArabella Chi, who is also expecting her first child with her boyfriend Billy Henty, quipped: 'Welcome to the mummy club gorgeous girl ❤️❤️❤️ so excited and happy for you xxxx'\nMolly Smith penned 'Omg!!!!!! Congratulations' alongside a series of crying emojis, while Ekin Su Cülcüloğlu wrote: 'Omg omg congratulations'. \nOlivia Bowen added: 'Omg my angel i am SO happy for you' and Tasha Ghouri and Sophie Piper also sent their well wishes. \nJack himself wrote: 'So excited it’s not normal Xxxxx' to which Georgia replied: '@jackpstacey love you daddy.' \nAnton DanylukGeorgia Harrison\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nGeorgia Harrison shares candid pregnancy update after revealing she is expecting her first child with boyfriend Jack Stacey\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

However, he said this was “not a media failure” but “a failure of the Democratic Party.” Further, he said the premise — that the establishment media covered it up — is a “right-wing manufactured, right-wing premise, in order to stain the media.”\n\nTodd believes there were those that “carried water” for Biden on establishment networks, but he claims those were merely pundits — not actual journalists.\n\n“There were water carriers, but they’re not real journalists!” Todd said. “I refuse to accept the premise that what Jen Psaki was saying, no offense to her, but she’s not a journalist, she’s a former spokesperson for Joe Biden.”\n\nTodd used the example of journalist David Ignatius, who wrote what he described as a “very high-profile column in Oct. 2023, saying, ‘Is he really running again? This doesn’t seem like a good idea.'”\n\n“This is an attempt by some to virtue signal,” Todd continued, putting these failures — the Biden coverup — at the feet of Democrat leaders and the Democrat Party as a whole.\n\n“And it’s this horrible sort of pitting different news organizations against each other when ultimately the people at fault are Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, Jill Biden, Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, every elected member of Congress,” Todd added.\n\nThe mental decline of Biden is now well-known and widely accepted, despite the denials from the establishment media as well as Democrats.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is among those who has struggled to concisely explain why she seemingly lied about the true state of Biden’s mental acuity.\n\n“Um, I said I had not seen decline,” Warren said when questioned during an appearance on Talk Easy with Sam Fragoso. “And I hadn’t at that point.”\n\n“You did not see any decline from 2024 Joe Biden to 2021 Joe Biden?” Fragoso pressed.\n\n“Not when I said that. You know the thing is, he — Look, he was sharp. He was on his feet. I saw him. Live event. I had meetings with him a couple of times,” Warren said.\n\nBut Fragoso interjected, noting that stating that Biden was “on his feet” and speaking in sentences is not praise.\n\n“All right. Fair enough. Fair enough,” Warren relented. … “The question is, what are we going to do now?”\n\nAnd despite Todd’s claims, the establishment media has continued to gaslight the American people on this issue, as reported by Breitbart News’s John Nolte on April 27:\n\nYes, on Saturday, the irredeemable corporate media used the White House Correspondents Dinner (WHCD) to laughably try to gaslight us with an all-new, bright and shining lie.\n\nFast-forward to Saturday’s annual self-regarding wank-a-thon, and the lying liars are still lying to us, only it’s a new lie: We didn’t know Joe Biden was a vegetable. We were too gullible. Too trusting. The White House fooled us!\nGet a load of DEI Hire Kristen Welker…","summary":"The establishment media \"didn't miss the story\" on former President Joe Biden's mental decline, former NBC host Chuck Todd said.\n\n\nThe post Chuck Todd Claims Establishment Media &#8216;Didn&#8217;t Miss the Story&#8217; on Biden&#8217;s Mental Decline appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/the-media/2025/04/29/chuck-todd-claims-establishment-media-didnt-miss-story-bidens-mental-decline/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/04/Chuck-Todd-and-Joe-Biden-640x335.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-29 20:58:27","author":"Hannah Knudsen","authors":["Hannah Knudsen"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.647},{"id":316178004,"title":"Trump dismisses Biden nominees to Holocaust Memorial Council","text":"US President Donald Trump has dismissed many of former president Joe Biden’s nominees to the United States Holocaust Memorial Council, including Doug Emhoff, the husband of former vice president Kamala Harris.\n\nMr Emhoff, who is Jewish and who led the Biden administration’s efforts to combat antisemitism, criticised Mr Trump’s action, saying: “Let me be clear: Holocaust remembrance and education should never be politicised.”\n\nHe added: “To turn one of the worst atrocities in history into a wedge issue is dangerous — and it dishonours the memory of six million Jews murdered by Nazis that this museum was created to preserve.”\n\nOthers dismissed alongside Mr Emhoff include former Biden chief of staff Ron Klain and former domestic policy adviser Susan Rice, who was the principal author of and the impetus behind the first-ever comprehensive National Strategy to Combat Antisemitism in 2023.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSince taking office in January Mr Trump has moved to sack many Biden appointees across government — including ostensibly apolitical roles.\n\nMr Biden too dismissed some Trump carryover appointees after he entered the White House in 2021, most notably 18 appointees named to US military academy boards, but at a far smaller scale.","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/trump-dismisses-biden-nominees-holocaust-205543403.html","image":"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/cxW031NxyjxQDUz.U2aivQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/pa_viral_news_704/c08d88c73caef0a468d36cdfc70f5bac","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-29 20:55:43","author":"Zeke Miller And Darlene Superville, Associated Press","authors":["Zeke Miller And Darlene Superville, Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.033},{"id":316179426,"title":"Trump dismisses Biden nominees to Holocaust Memorial Council","text":"US President Donald Trump has dismissed many of former president Joe Biden’s nominees to the United States Holocaust Memorial Council, including Doug Emhoff, the husband of former vice president Kamala Harris.\n\nMr Emhoff, who is Jewish and who led the Biden administration’s efforts to combat antisemitism, criticised Mr Trump’s action, saying: “Let me be clear: Holocaust remembrance and education should never be politicised.”\n\nHe added: “To turn one of the worst atrocities in history into a wedge issue is dangerous — and it dishonours the memory of six million Jews murdered by Nazis that this museum was created to preserve.”\n\nOthers dismissed alongside Mr Emhoff include former Biden chief of staff Ron Klain and former domestic policy adviser Susan Rice, who was the principal author of and the impetus behind the first-ever comprehensive National Strategy to Combat Antisemitism in 2023.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSince taking office in January Mr Trump has moved to sack many Biden appointees across government — including ostensibly apolitical roles.\n\nMr Biden too dismissed some Trump carryover appointees after he entered the White House in 2021, most notably 18 appointees named to US military academy boards, but at a far smaller scale.","summary":"US President Donald Trump has dismissed many of former president Joe Biden’s nominees to the United States Holocaust Memorial Council, including Doug Emhoff, the husband of former vice president Kamala Harris.

I think she is maybe just jealous about me doing so well and so quickly.\n'I think that's what my parents' issue is really. They think I've done it off their backs, but actually, behind the scenes, it takes a lot more work than just being their daughter.'\nIt comes after Mia revealed that Sammy hasn't tried to get in touch with her and that other relatives have called and texted her with abusive messages when she tried to contact them.\nShe said back in August: 'My mum has me blocked on everything. So yeah, she didn't contact me whatsoever. A few other family members have contacted me but I made the decision to let them cool off slightly because the messages they were sending weren't lovely.'\nThe mother and daughter were thought to have been close, previously describing their relationship as being like 'best mates', but Mia admitted that was untrue and in fact they sometimes 'butted heads' due to their similarities.\nWhile she refused to speak negatively of her family, she confessed that she felt their reaction was extreme, insisting she would never do the same to her future children.\nShe said: 'I've honestly not got anything bad to say about any of them per se, but the way they've reacted to the situation personally, it just wouldn't even cross my mind to do that to my own child, I think.' \nWhile she remains hopeful that she and Sammy can patch things up, Mia explained that she would be taking a step back until everyone had cooled off and said it would be down to her family to be the ones to reach out to make amends.\nShe said: 'I feel like at this point it is going to have to be them coming to me because I've tried to maintain contact in the past and they just don't have any of it and then I end up getting like, all the abuse like through the phone, through text messages, calls.\n'So I'm just going to wait until they come to me, maybe like in a calmer manner and you know, they're a little bit less fresh to the whole situation.'\nOnlyFansEmmerdale\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nEmmerdale star Sammy Winward's daughter Mia Dunn takes a swipe at her estranged parents over getting a 'real job' after OnlyFans fallout\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 23\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

It investigates and prosecutes those accused of war crimes, genocide and other crimes against humanity.\n'The U.S. will impose tangible & significant consequences on those responsible for the ICC's transgressions,' Trump's order states.\nThe warrant for Netanyahu's arrest was pushed by Khan.\nIf the PM was to visit any countries like France or the U.K., he could be arrested. Khan also put out warrants for top Hamas leaders who have since been killed.\nAmal was born in war-torn Beirut to one of Lebanon's most famous women journalists before emigrating to the United Kingdom to escape civil war when she was 2 and becoming a British citizen.\nShe previously represented WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange during his high-profile his extradition battle.\n\nTrump issued Executive Order 14203 - Imposing Sanctions on the International Criminal Court in February - naming ICC official Karim Khan, who is from the UK \n\nIf additional sanctions end up getting handed down, Amal - who served as a special adviser in International Criminal Court Prosecutor Khan's investigation that led him to seek arrest warrants for Israeli and Hamas leaders, could be barred from the US - pictured September 2024\n\nIn May 2024, Amal hit back at critics accusing her of not using her platform to highlight the alleged plight of the Palestinian people - \n\n'I served on this Panel because I believe in the rule of law and the need to protect civilian lives,' Clooney wrote in a statement about her role in filing the warrants - pictured December 2023\n\nIn 2024, she won the Legal 500 Award for international lawyer of the year.\n\nEXCLUSIVE Lawyer who called for Netanyahu's arrest over 'war crimes' will not step down amid sex assault probe \nClooney is qualified to practice law in the United States and England and Wales. She was admitted to the bar in New York in 2002 \nAmal frequently represents victims of mass atrocities, including genocide and sexual violence. \nShe has acted in many landmark human rights cases including the world’s first trials in which ISIS members have been convicted of genocide and crimes against humanity. \nIn May 2024, Amal hit back at critics accusing her of not using her platform to highlight the alleged plight of the Palestinian people. \nThe attorney's father is Lebanese and her mother is a Sunni-Muslim of Palestinian ancestry.\n'I served on this Panel because I believe in the rule of law and the need to protect civilian lives,' Clooney wrote in a statement about her role in filing the warrants. \n'The law that protects civilians in war was developed more than 100 years ago and it applies in every country in the world regardless of the reasons for a conflict.'\nAt least one TikTok user compared Amal to DJ Khaled, the Palestinian-American music sensation who has remained silent on the issues. \nAnother, MillennialRox, said the Amal was more concerned with her Hollywood lifestyle than with the atrocities in Gaza. \nMillenialRox also pointed out that Amal had been vocal in condemning Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine .\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nGeorge Clooney's lawyer wife Amal could face BAN from US amid explosive Trump sanctions\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

Emhoff, who is Jewish and who led the Biden administration's efforts to combat antisemitism, criticised Trump's action, saying, “Let me be clear: Holocaust remembrance and education should never be politicised.” Also Read | ‘Children Being Bombed is Never Right’: ‘Bridgerton’ Star Nicola Coughlan Defends Her Palestine Stance, Also Speaks in Support of Trans Rights.

Trump, I am writing to inform you that your position as a member of the United States Holocaust Memorial Council is terminated, effective immediately.' \n\nBiden's former chief of staff Ron Klain, Barack Obama's national security adviser Susan Rice and Jill Biden's adviser Anthony Bernal were also fired.\n\nTrump's action comes as Harris wants to propel herself back into the national political conversation with an upcoming major speech criticizing Trump.\n\nThe failed presidential candidate will deliver the keynote speech at the Emerge 20th anniversary gala at the Palace Hotel in San Francisco on Wednesday at 10 p.m. ET.\n\nThe speech will be live-streamed, according to the organizer Emerge, a Democratic group that recruits and trains women to run for public office.\n\nIt's a major fundraiser as tickets cost up to $50,000 for a sponsor. But the group is also charging $25 per virtual watch.\n\nHarris is expected to deliver a 'call to action,' urging activists and future candidates for political office to have the courage to make their voices heard about Trump's actions as president according to CNN.\n\n'She will reflect on the enduring promise of America and issue a call to action in the face of reckless economic policies and the urgent and escalating crisis facing America's institutions and global leadership,' a person with knowledge of Harris' speech to the Los Angeles Times.\n\nThe group was founded after Harris won her race for San Francisco district attorney as her advisors believed there was a lack of resources to recruit women for political office.\n\n'Vice President Harris is the original Emerge woman,' said A'shanti F. Gholar, president and CEO of Emerge, in a statement. 'She continues to be a champion for Emerge and an advocate for elevating women in elected office.'\n\nNews of Harris' return to the national stage drew mockery from critics.\n\n‘When you fire a head coach the last person you want to hear from is a fired head coach,’ wrote Mike Lester on X.\n\n‘Can’t wait to hear more about the duality of Democracy in this moment,’ wrote Steve Mur on X, mocking some of her empty messaging lines from the presidential campaign.\n\n‘Oh, this should be really good! Good in terms of comedy. Her speech writers are busy right now putting cackles and word salad together and some gibberish about her being middle class and Trump being a dictator,’ wrote Tom Johnson on X.\n\n'Everyone already knows she will fail at the speech given she slurs, makes up stories and gets lost in the middle of the stories,' wrote X user Bret Weingart\n\nHarris return to the public stage raises questions about the next step of her political career as she weighs whether or not she wants to run for Governor of California in 2026.\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom is term limited from running again and is already eying the 2028 presidential race.\n\nDemocrats are also watching Harris to see if she wants to run again for president in 2028, as she feels she did not have enough time to be fully competitive in her failed 2024 campaign.","summary":"Donald Trump knows where to hit Kamala Harris where it hurts. ","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14661331/Kamala-Harris-dealt-final-brutal-blow-Trump-goes-husband-Doug-Emhoff-petty-action.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/29/21/97840727-0-image-a-78_1745957793239.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-29 20:21:57","author":"Charlie Spiering,Editor","authors":["Charlie Spiering","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.377}]}
