Ramaswamy spoke to Fox News Digital shortly after arriving at the Phoenix Convention Center on Friday, and said he had already met several people here who told him they were energized to join him at the conference. \"Funny enough, and I often like to do this when I travel west, I went for a hike earlier today -- to what's called Camelback Mountain, and we saw tons of young people who are going to be here tonight that were getting their outdoor time, so I got to talk to a lot of them,\" he said. \"I would say the mood is a combination of enthusiastic and determined, but with a sober sentimentality as well. It's clear that a lot of these young people were, I mean just like me and the rest of us, affected by Charlie's death, and they're hungry for direction.\" CONSERVATIVES NEED TO EMBRACE ‘FUSION’ OF POPULISM, TOP LEADER SAYS, CALLING AMFEST SCENES ARE ‘ENCOURAGING’ Many of the young conservatives he met appeared to want to find the direction the conservative movement and TPUSA will go following Kirk’s death. In Ohio, where he is seeking to succeed term-limited moderate Republican Mike DeWine, Ramaswamy stressed that even though Ohio has been reliably red, he isn't taking the race for granted. Republicans are reeling from a string of losses from Florida to Pennsylvania just weeks ago. VIVEK RAMASWAMY CRITICIZES POCKETS OF 'ONLINE RIGHT' FIXATED ON HERITAGE IN TURNING POINT ADDRESS \"I think we’ve got to worry less about just defeating the left -- because we did that last year. That's not good enough. We have to offer our own vision of what do we actually stand for,\" Ramaswamy said. \"And, in Ohio, what I know I'm going be able to deliver is two things that Ohio needs and I believe this country needs: Number one is to put more money back in people's pockets,\" he said, noting that government cannot immediately rein in rising commodity costs as voters demanded in selecting President Donald Trump over Kamala Harris’ continuation of the Biden agenda. \"We can do certain things, like bring down electric bills by producing more energy. We'll do those things. But the direct way we can help people is put more money in people's pockets by bringing down the property tax burden, by taking the income tax rate down to zero, so people are actually able to have more money to afford things, not just waiting for costs to come down,\" he said. GEN Z IS STRUGGLING TO SURVIVE — AND REPUBLICANS CAN'T AFFORD TO LOOK AWAY \"And number two is preparing our young people to be useful, contributing members of the workforce with a better education system.\" Ramaswamy said that the education system has failed American youth for years, through \"woke indoctrination\" and \"victimhood psychology,\" and also is something that states should be able to fix. \"As someone who did run for president, I can tell you that a governor can make an even bigger difference than a president when it comes to education,\" he said. CHARLIE KIRK ALLY WARNS GOP NOT TO TAKE GEN Z FOR GRANTED, CALLING FOR 'SENSE OF URGENCY' \"I hope we in Ohio set an example of what the other 49 states can actually aspire to.\" Looking past Trump’s term limit in 2028, Ramaswamy said the conservative movement will continue so long as it maintains its \"aspirational\" focus. \"That's my message to those young people tonight, and it is a challenging message. It's not sugar-coated. The number one factor that determines whether you achieve your goals in life is actually you. That's a tough message, but it's the truth. JFK, who famously said, right, ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country. Now's the moment to remember that message,\" he said. HUSTED FILES FOR 2026 SENATE RACE, LAUNCHING AGGRESSIVE STATEWIDE RE-ELECTION PUSH Turning to another Kennedy, Ramaswamy – who founded biotech pharma company Roivant Sciences – was asked his view of the MAHA agenda being pursued by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Ramaswamy said MAHA has established youth health as paramount to healthy future generations. Kennedy’s pursuit of healthier foods in schools, returning to stronger physical education standards and the like underlies the \"core thesis behind MAHA.\" CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP \"That is, that the best way to bring down health care costs -- who would have ever thought -- is actually to have a healthier population in the first place.\" \"That's something that most Americans are behind. The ‘how’ is, of course, easier said than done, but there are common-sense state level changes that I'm confident we can implement in Ohio that aren't about right versus left. It's about right vs. Wrong.

He later served food to men experiencing homelessness in Allentown.\n\nThe visit, on top of several recent speeches from President Donald Trump, reflects an increasingly urgent White House effort to respond to the economic anxiety that is gripping both parties. Those worries are a vulnerability for Republicans in competitive congressional districts like the one that includes Allentown, which could decide control of the U.S. House in next year’s midterms.\n\nBut in confronting the challenge, there are risks of appearing out of touch.\n\nOnly 31% of U.S. adults now approve of how Trump is handling the economy, down from 40% in March, according to a poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.

In our world, trust me, it’s not an ‘A.’ To me, it’s an ‘F,’ ‘F,’ ‘F,’ ‘F,’ ‘F,’ ‘F.’”\n\nAgreement that prices are too high\n\nWith a population of roughly 125,000 people, Allentown anchors the Lehigh Valley, which is Pennsylvania’s third-largest metro area. In a dozen interviews this week with local officials, business leaders and residents of both parties, there was agreement on one thing: Prices are too high. Some pointed to gas prices while others said they felt the shock more at the grocery store or in their cost of health care or housing.\n\nFew shared Trump’s unbridled boosterism about the economy.\n\nTony Iannelli, the president and CEO of the Greater Lehigh Valley Chamber of Commerce, called Trump’s grade a “stretch,” saying “we have a strong economy but I think it’s not yet gone to the next stage of what I would call robust.”\n\nTom Groves, who started a health and benefits consulting firm more than two decades ago, said the economy was at a “B+” as he blamed the Affordable Care Act, widely known as “Obamacare,” for contributing to higher health costs and he noted stock and labor market volatility. Joe Vichot, the chairman of the Lehigh County Republican Committee, referred to Trump’s grade as a “colloquialism.”\n\nFar removed from Washington’s political theater, there was little consensus on who was responsible for the high prices or what should be done about it. There was, however, an acute sense of exhaustion at the seemingly endless political combat.\n\nPat Gallagher was finishing lunch a few booths down from Bisbal as she recalled meeting her late husband when they both worked at Bethlehem Steel, the manufacturing giant that closed in 2003. Now retired, she, too, relies on Social Security benefits and lives with her daughter, which helps keep costs down. She said she noticed the rising price of groceries and was becoming exasperated with the political climate.\n\n“I get so frustrated with hearing about the politics,” she said.\n\nAllentown has a front-row seat to politics\n\nThat feeling is understandable in a place that often gets a front-row seat to the national debate, whether it wants the view or not. Singer Billy Joel’s 1982 song “Allentown” helped elevate the city into the national consciousness, articulating simultaneous feelings of disillusionment and hope as factories shuttered.\n\nIn the decades since, Pennsylvania has become a must-win state in presidential politics and the backdrop for innumerable visits from candidates and the media. Trump and his Democratic rival in 2024, Kamala Harris, made several campaign swings through Allentown, with the then-vice president visiting the city on the eve of the election.\n\n“Every race here, all the time,” Allentown’s mayor, Democrat Matt Tuerk, recalled of the frenzied race last year.\n\nThe pace of those visits — and the attention they garnered — has not faded from many minds. Some businesses and residents declined to talk this week when approached with questions about the economy or politics, recalling blowback from speaking in the past.\n\nBut as attention shifts to next year’s midterms, Allentown cannot escape its place as a political battleground.\n\nTrump’s win last year helped lift other Republicans, like U.S. Rep. Ryan Mackenzie, to victory. Mackenzie, who unseated a three-term Democrat, is now one of the most vulnerable Republicans in Congress. To win again, he must turn out the Republicans who voted in 2024 — many of whom were likely more energized by Trump’s candidacy — while appealing to independents.\n\nMackenzie’s balancing act was on display when he spoke to the party faithful on Tuesday, bemoaning the “failures of Bidenomics” before Vance took the stage at the rally. A day later, the congressman was back in Washington, where he joined three other House Republicans to rebel against the party’s leadership and force a vote on extending health care subsidies that expire at the end of the year.\n\nVichot, the local GOP chairman, called Mackenzie an “underdog” in his reelection bid and said the health care move was a signal to voters that he is “compassionate for the people who need those services.”\n\nA swing to Trump in 2024\n\nLehigh County, home to Allentown and the most populous county in the congressional district, swung toward Trump last year. Harris’ nearly 2.7 percentage point win in the county was the tightest margin for a Democratic presidential candidate since 2004. But Democrats are feeling confident after a strong performance in this fall’s elections when they handily won a race for county executive.\n\nRetaking the congressional seat is now a top priority for Democrats. Gov. Josh Shapiro, who faces reelection next year and is a potential presidential contender in 2028, endorsed firefighter union head Bob Brooks this week for the May primary.\n\nDemocrats are just a few seats shy of regaining the House majority and the first midterm after a presidential election historically favors the party that’s out of power. If the focus remains on the economy, Democrats are happy.\n\nThe Uline supplies distribution factory where Vance spoke, owned by a family that has made large donations to GOP causes, is a few miles from the Mack Trucks facility where staff was cut by about 200 employees this year. The company said that decision was driven in part by tariffs imposed by Trump. Shapiro eagerly pointed that out in responding to Vance’s visit.\n\nBut the image of Allentown as a purely manufacturing town is outdated. The downtown core is dotted by row homes, trendy hotels and a modern arena that is home to the Lehigh Valley Phantoms hockey team and hosts concerts by major artists. In recent years, Latinos have become a majority of the city’s population, driven by gains in the Puerto Rican, Mexican and Dominican communities.\n\n“This is a place of rapid change,” said Tuerk, the city’s first Latino mayor. “It’s constantly changing and I think over the next three years until that next presidential election, we’re going to see a lot more change. It’s going to be an interesting ride.”","summary":"Only 31% of U.S. adults now approve of how Trump is handling the economy, down from 40% in March, according to a poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.","url":"https://fortune.com/2025/12/20/trump-economy-cost-of-living-pennsylvania-chamber-of-commerce-affordability-midterms/","image":"https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP25352486430254-e1766251072292.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-20 17:23:32","author":"Steven Sloan,The Associated Press","authors":["Steven Sloan","The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.217},{"id":387817374,"title":"2028 lines being drawn among conservatives as two top names emerge among AmericaFest activists","text":"The 2028 presidential election will potentially be a rumble in the Rust Belt if AmericaFest attendees’ predictions come to pass, with Vice President JD Vance the odds-on favorite to succeed President Donald Trump, and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro surpassing California Gov. Gavin Newsom as the most-predicted Democrat nominee. Such a contest would also pit two younger figures against each other – with Shapiro at 52 and Vance at 41 — while also potentially reshaping the idea of the \"blue wall\" that Trump shattered in 2024 as Shapiro’s name recognition in Pennsylvania could return the state to the Democrats’ column. For his part, Shapiro has dismissed any curiosity about a White House run, recently telling HBO’s Bill Maher he’s \"not an expert\" on Beltway politics and \"live[s] in the real world in Pennsylvania where we have to balance budgets.\" But, that sentiment didn’t keep him from being considered more viable for the role than the more gregarious Newsom. 'OBAMA BRO' PODCASTER RAILS AGAINST JD VANCE'S CHANCES IN 2028, CLAIMS 'NO ONE LIKES HIM!' Barbara, from Camarillo, Calif., said she hopes Vance is able to step into President Donald Trump’s shoes, calling him a \"great candidate\" who comes from the \"team that Trump built.\" \"I think we’re in a good place right now,\" she said.

Shapiro has occasionally broken with the far-left, particularly on the issue of antisemitism. But, when New Jersey gubernatorial candidate Jack Ciattarelli wished aloud that the Garden State would be run more like its neighbor across the Delaware, Shapiro hit back that he was fully supporting Gov-elect. Mikie Sherill. TRUMP SAYS JD VANCE WOULD BE 'PROBABLY FAVORED' FOR 2028 REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION Nick from Nashville also named Shapiro as the most viable Democratic prospect. While he predicted Newsom or Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. may be the nominee chosen by the base, the Democratic National Committee would be smart if it facilitated a Shapiro nomination, he said. Speaking about the future of post-Trump conservatism, Nick said he expects a lot of competing yet largely ideologically unified voices. \"I think the conservative party will kind of conglomerate over somebody like Trump. I think Trump's going to have a very big hand and who's going to be the nominee in 2028. But I think the conservative [movement] is still going to be alive. But I think that it's mostly going to be whoever Donald Trump kind of wants, because, you know, he basically built the conservative movement,\" he said.

Ron DeSantis already cleaned the carpet with Newsom [on \"Hannity\"], so I don't think JD Vance will have much problem, because he is a very well spoken, intelligent, smart man.\" Amy from Michigan also predicted the Pennsylvanian as the Democrats’ top pick in 2028, envisioning a battle between Vance and Shapiro for the presidency. Elizabeth from San Diego said she hopes it won’t be her governor who gets named the nominee in 2028, but feared it is trending his way moreso than Shapiro or Illinois Gov.

Trump and his Democratic rival in 2024, Kamala Harris, made several campaign swings through Allentown, with the then-vice president visiting the city on the eve of the election. \n\n“Every race here, all the time,” Allentown’s mayor, Democrat Matt Tuerk, recalled of the frenzied race last year.\n\nThe pace of those visits — and the attention they garnered — has not faded from many minds. Some businesses and residents declined to talk this week when approached with questions about the economy or politics, recalling blowback from speaking in the past. \n\nBut as attention shifts to next year’s midterms, Allentown cannot escape its place as a political battleground.\n\nTrump’s win last year helped lift other Republicans, like U.S. Rep. Ryan Mackenzie, to victory. Mackenzie, who unseated a three-term Democrat, is now one of the most vulnerable Republicans in Congress. To win again, he must turn out the Republicans who voted in 2024 — many of whom were likely more energized by Trump’s candidacy — while appealing to independents.\n\nMackenzie’s balancing act was on display when he spoke to the party faithful on Tuesday, bemoaning the “failures of Bidenomics” before Vance took the stage at the rally. A day later, the congressman was back in Washington, where he joined three other House Republicans to rebel against the party’s leadership and force a vote on extending health care subsidies that expire at the end of the year.\n\nVichot, the local GOP chairman, called Mackenzie an “underdog” in his reelection bid and said the health care move was a signal to voters that he is “compassionate for the people who need those services.”\n\nA swing to Trump in 2024\n\nLehigh County, home to Allentown and the most populous county in the congressional district, swung toward Trump last year. Harris’ nearly 2.7 percentage point win in the county was the tightest margin for a Democratic presidential candidate since 2004. But Democrats are feeling confident after a strong performance in this fall’s elections when they handily won a race for county executive. \n\nRetaking the congressional seat is now a top priority for Democrats. Gov. Josh Shapiro, who faces reelection next year and is a potential presidential contender in 2028, endorsed firefighter union head Bob Brooks this week for the May primary.\n\nDemocrats are just a few seats shy of regaining the House majority and the first midterm after a presidential election historically favors the party that’s out of power. If the focus remains on the economy, Democrats are happy. \n\nThe Uline supplies distribution factory where Vance spoke, owned by a family that has made large donations to GOP causes, is a few miles from the Mack Trucks facility where staff was cut by about 200 employees this year. The company said that decision was driven in part by tariffs imposed by Trump. Shapiro eagerly pointed that out in responding to Vance’s visit.\n\nBut the image of Allentown as a purely manufacturing town is outdated. The downtown core is dotted by row homes, trendy hotels and a modern arena that is home to the Lehigh Valley Phantoms hockey team and hosts concerts by major artists. In recent years, Latinos have become a majority of the city’s population, driven by gains in the Puerto Rican, Mexican and Dominican communities. \n\n“This is a place of rapid change,” said Tuerk, the city’s first Latino mayor. “It’s constantly changing and I think over the next three years until that next presidential election, we’re going to see a lot more change. It’s going to be an interesting ride.”","summary":"Trump’s ‘A+++++' economy collides with reality in a Pennsylvania city critical to the midterms  AP News","url":"https://apnews.com/article/trump-economy-2026-election-allentown-republicans-ccfc8351c2c081693ce763c1be34e749","image":"https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/2106d16/2147483647/strip/false/crop/4967x3311+0+0/resize/1486x991!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Ffd%2Fb7%2F24604efa620ca8741757c0957c30%2Fd32cb36a49624968a90dc72414b0add1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-20 14:06:00","author":"Steven Sloan","authors":["Steven Sloan"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.148},{"id":387808796,"title":"Photos of Bill Clinton feature prominently in first batch of newly released Epstein files","text":"WASHINGTON (AP) — Former President Bill Clinton featured prominently in the first batch of files released Friday by the Justice Department stemming from its investigation into convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, as the White House seized the chance to shift the focus of the highly anticipated documents from President Donald Trump.\n\nThere were several photos of Clinton among the thousands of documents made public. Some showed him on a private plane, including one with a woman, whose face is redacted, seated alongside him with her arm around him. Another photo shows him in a pool with Epstein’s longtime confidant, British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, and a person whose face was also redacted.\n\nAnother photo shows Clinton in a hot tub with a woman whose face was redacted. The files do not say when or where the photos were taken and there was little context surrounding them.\n\nThe 79-year-old Clinton’s political career has been marred by personal scandals in the past and his impeachment in 1998. His association with Epstein and Maxwell in the late 1990s and early 2000s is well documented and the images released Friday are just a slice of the “several hundred thousand” documents Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche has said are tied to the investigation.\n\nBut the photos depict a web of unsavory relationships and associations that complicate both Democratic efforts to keep the focus on Trump and the incumbent president’s desire to move on from the issue entirely.\n\nAfter the photos were released, several White House officials, including press secretary Karoline Leavitt and top aide Steven Cheung, made social media posts highlighting them. Trump didn’t talk about the issue as he left the White House late Friday on his way to deliver a speech in North Carolina.\n\nClinton has never been accused of wrongdoing in connection with Epstein, and the mere inclusion of someone’s name or images in files from the investigation does not imply otherwise. In a statement, Clinton spokesman Angel Ureña said the White House was “shielding themselves from what comes next, or from what they’ll try and hide forever.”\n\n“They can release as many grainy 20-plus-year-old photos as they want, but this isn’t about Bill Clinton,” Ureña said. “Never has been, never will be.”\n\nRepublicans have zeroed in on Clinton\n\nLong before Friday’s photos, Republicans had zeroed in on the former president and his association with Epstein.\n\nRepublicans on the House Oversight Committee had subpoenaed both Bill and Hillary Clinton for depositions earlier this year, but received a response that the Clintons wanted to provide a written statement of what “little information” they had on Epstein.\n\nThe Republican chair of the committee, Rep. James Comer, has demanded they appear for in-person testimonies and threatened to initiate contempt of Congress proceedings if they don’t.\n\nMultiple former presidents have voluntarily testified before Congress, but none has been compelled to do so.\n\nWhen Clinton was president, Epstein visited the White House multiple times, visitor logs show. After he left office, Epstein assisted with some of the former president’s philanthropy. Clinton flew multiple times on Epstein’s private jet, including on a humanitarian trip to Africa with actors Kevin Spacey and Chris Tucker in 2002.\n\nClinton first ran for president in 1992 as a new type of Democrat, hailing from the South with an appeal that united his party’s base along with moderate voters. He became the first Democrat in 16 years to win the White House and remains one of his party’s most prominent figures. He had a prime-time speaking slot during last summer’s Democratic National Convention in which he made a forceful case for Kamala Harris’ candidacy.\n\nBut Clinton’s ties to the Epstein case are a reminder of how his political promise has always been tempered by personal indiscretions.\n\nHis 1992 campaign was dogged by rumors of an affair with Gennifer Flowers, which he denied at the time. His presidency was rocked when he was impeached in 1998 for lying under oath and obstructing justice when he denied engaging in a sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky. He ultimately acknowledged a relationship with Lewinsky that was “not appropriate” while insisting that “even presidents have private lives.”\n\nTrump, whose 2016 campaign was nearly derailed when a tape emerged of him bragging about grabbing women by the genitals, has often deflected allegations of sexual misconduct by pointing to Clinton’s behavior. But even Trump’s top allies have questioned those claims. In an interview published by Vanity Fair this week, White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles said Trump “was wrong” in frequently suggesting the Epstein files included incriminating information about Clinton.\n\nAssociated Press writers Stephen Groves and Gary Fields in Washington contributed to this report.","summary":"There were several photos of Clinton among the thousands of documents made public.\n\n\nThe post Photos of Bill Clinton feature prominently in first batch of newly released Epstein files appeared first on Boston.com.","url":"https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2025/12/20/photos-of-bill-clinton-feature-prominently-in-first-batch-of-newly-released-epstein-files/","image":"https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Justice_Department_Jeffrey_Epstein_71674-6945e9eeba7fa-768x432.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-20 14:06:00","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.121},{"id":387795922,"title":"Trump’s ‘A+++++’ economy collides with the reality in a Pennsylvania city critical to the midterms","text":"ALLENTOWN, Pa. (AP) — When Idalia Bisbal moved to this Pennsylvania city synonymous with America’s working class, she hoped for a cheaper, easier life than the one she was leaving behind in her hometown of New York City.\n\nAbout three years later, she is deeply disappointed.\n\n“It’s worse than ever,” the 67-year-old retiree, who relies on Social Security, said when asked about the economy. “The prices are high. Everything is going up. You can’t afford food because you can’t afford rent. Utilities are too high. Gas is too expensive. Everything is too expensive.”\n\nBisbal was sipping an afternoon coffee at the Hamilton Family Restaurant not long after Vice President JD Vance rallied Republicans in a nearby suburb. In the Trump administration’s second high-profile trip to Pennsylvania in a week, Vance acknowledged the affordability crisis, blamed it on the Biden administration and insisted better times were ahead. He later served food to men experiencing homelessness in Allentown.\n\nThe visit, on top of several recent speeches from President Donald Trump, reflects an increasingly urgent White House effort to respond to the economic anxiety that is gripping both parties. Those worries are a vulnerability for Republicans in competitive congressional districts like the one that includes Allentown, which could decide control of the U.S. House in next year’s midterms.\n\nBut in confronting the challenge, there are risks of appearing out of touch.\n\nOnly 31% of U.S. adults now approve of how Trump is handling the economy, down from 40% in March, according to a poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Yet Trump has called affordability concerns a “ hoax ” and gave the economy under his administration a grade of “A+++++.” Vance reiterated that assessment during his rally, prompting Bisbal to scoff.\n\n“In his world,” Bisbal, a self-described “straight-up Democrat,” responded. “In the rich man’s world. In our world, trust me, it’s not an ‘A.’ To me, it’s an ‘F,’ ‘F,’ ‘F,’ ‘F,’ ‘F,’ ‘F.’”\n\nAgreement that prices are too high\n\nWith a population of roughly 125,000 people, Allentown anchors the Lehigh Valley, which is Pennsylvania’s third-largest metro area. In a dozen interviews this week with local officials, business leaders and residents of both parties, there was agreement on one thing: Prices are too high. Some pointed to gas prices while others said they felt the shock more at the grocery store or in their cost of health care or housing.\n\nFew shared Trump’s unbridled boosterism about the economy.\n\nTony Iannelli, the president and CEO of the Greater Lehigh Valley Chamber of Commerce, called Trump’s grade a “stretch,” saying “we have a strong economy but I think it’s not yet gone to the next stage of what I would call robust.”\n\nTom Groves, who started a health and benefits consulting firm more than two decades ago, said the economy was at a “B+” as he blamed the Affordable Care Act, widely known as “Obamacare,” for contributing to higher health costs and he noted stock and labor market volatility. Joe Vichot, the chairman of the Lehigh County Republican Committee, referred to Trump’s grade as a “colloquialism.”\n\nFar removed from Washington’s political theater, there was little consensus on who was responsible for the high prices or what should be done about it. There was, however, an acute sense of exhaustion at the seemingly endless political combat.\n\nPat Gallagher was finishing lunch a few booths down from Bisbal as she recalled meeting her late husband when they both worked at Bethlehem Steel, the manufacturing giant that closed in 2003. Now retired, she, too, relies on Social Security benefits and lives with her daughter, which helps keep costs down. She said she noticed the rising price of groceries and was becoming exasperated with the political climate.\n\n“I get so frustrated with hearing about the politics,” she said.\n\nAllentown has a front-row seat to politics\n\nThat feeling is understandable in a place that often gets a front-row seat to the national debate, whether it wants the view or not.

If victorious, Villegas would add to progressive’s power in Washington while simultaneously reducing the number of representatives amenable to bipartisan compromise.\n\nRedistricting aside, CA-22 figures to be a slightly Republican-leaning district, thus Bains may have a real shot at flipping a seat – whereas Villegas likely does not. Boosting Villegas at the expense of Bains may cost Democrats a potentially winnable seat.\n\nOutside of California, the hole Democrats are digging for themselves by letting progressives drive the party is even more apparent. \n\nIn Texas, former Democratic Rep. Colin Allred was “pressured out of a Senate run, to clear the decks for uber-progressive Rep. Jasmine Crockett.”\n\nNever mind that Allred outperformed former Vice President Kamala Harris by 6% in 2024 or that Crockett trails every GOP challenger according to 270toWin. \n\nAlso disregard that Texas hasn’t had a Democratic senator since 1995. For progressives, the point is to make noise, regardless of whether Democrats are putting forward the candidate with the best chance to win.\n\nOf course, in a democracy, whoever gets a majority of the votes in a single state or district is the rightful winner. However, progressive dominance of Democrats’ grassroots organizations means that more often than not, the party is advancing the least electable politicians in a general election.\n\nIn that same vein, progressive dominance ensures that Democrats’ Congressional caucus is populated by far-left ideologues, not the moderate Democrats who are most likely to find common cause with the GOP in bipartisan solutions to the problems we face as a country. \n\nA recent report from center-left group Welcome emphasizes the vulnerability this poses. It cites that seven-in-ten (70%) voters find the Democratic party to be “out of touch” and too focused on progressive issues.\n\nAdditionally, the report states that most voters believe the party does not care enough about securing the border or lowering crime rates – two key issues that significantly contributed to Harris’ 2024 defeat and threaten to reemerge as major vulnerabilities for Democrats, especially in the 2028 presidential election.\n\nPlainly, Welcome’s report should be a deafening alarm to Democrats. \n\nIt makes clear that the voters who decide presidential elections want Democrats to abandon their extreme, progressive ideology in favor of moderate Democrats, with the side effect of reorienting the entire Democratic Party towards the center. \n\nAnd yet, Democrats appear poised to do the opposite. \n\nWhether out of fear of the far-left or unwillingness to confront the most vocal part of their base on issues like DEI, immigration, the economy, and social issues, moderate Democrats are running the risk of ceding the party to the most unelectable major party platform in modern history.\n\nThat being said, some Democrats have already opted to take this centrist approach, including California Governor Gavin Newsom, who seemingly has his eye on a 2028 bid for the Oval Office.\n\nNewsom, one of President Trump’s loudest opponents, has moved to the center in the last few years. \n\n on transgender athletes in sports, and – arguably most importantly – \n\n his fellow Democrats to be “more culturally normal” and “less judgmental” earlier this month.\n\nIn bucking progressive orthodoxies, Newsom is attempting to appeal to the national electorate Democrats need to return to the White House, which is much more moderate than the far-left.\n\nRegrettably, as the Welcome report makes clear, the effects of the progressive surge have already begun to eat away at the Democratic brand, making the party seem narrow-minded, less practical, and ineffective at a time when they should be solidifying their platform.\n\nUltimately, if Democrats prove unable to shake off the rise of the progressives, then they will have nobody to blame for their self-sabotage aside from themselves. For the party to be competitive beyond relying on “we’re not Trump,” they will have to find a way to separate themselves from the extremists in their party. \n\nConversely, if Democrats decide to follow the lead of progressives like Mamdani and Ocasio-Cortez, they will have snatched defeat from the jaws of victory and will cost themselves another election.\n\nDouglas Schoen is a longtime Democratic political consultant.","summary":"Heading into 2026, Democrats are on the brink of success  and self-sabotage","url":"https://www.presstelegram.com/2025/12/18/heading-into-2026-democrats-are-on-the-brink-of-success-and-self-sabotage/","image":"https://www.presstelegram.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/SUT-Z-Mamdani-AP25325767592712-01.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-20 11:33:11","author":"Gqlshare","authors":["Gqlshare"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ie","sentiment":-0.144},{"id":387785504,"title":"Turning Point USA Has An Erika Kirk Problem","text":"A week after Charlie Kirk was assassinated, Turning Point USA’s chief operating officer made a prediction.\n\n“Charlie Kirk came and converted the young men. Erika Kirk is coming to convert the young women,” Tyler Bowyer wrote on X. It raked in nearly 100,000 likes and has been reposted close to 9,000 times. \n\nThat forecast accompanied the news that Erika Kirk would assume her late husband’s role as CEO and chair of his conservative nonprofit, a force on college campuses credited with luring so many Gen Z men to far-right politics in an election that sent President Donald Trump back to the White House.\n\nHeadlines pondering the possibility ensued. “In Erika Kirk, conservative women see the future,” CNN wrote the next day. “Republicans hope Erika Kirk can bring more young women into the party,” NBC News ran weeks later. They featured interviews with young conservative women and Republican strategists ― many of them suggesting Turning Point could use Erika Kirk as a conduit to reach Gen Z women.\n\nTurning Point USA didn’t respond when asked if it had seen more interest from young women since Erika Kirk took over. It also did not respond to requests for an interview with her. \n\nThe reality, experts in the young voting bloc say, is that young women really aren’t buying the narrative that Erika Kirk has been peddling: that they’d be happier leaving their careers behind, getting married young, having children and “submitting” to their husbands. \n\n“I certainly think that Erica Kirk could be a strong leader, bringing in more young women than, perhaps, have been a part of the Turning Point movement to date, but I don’t suspect we’re going to see a massive shift right amongst young women anytime soon,” said Rachel Janfaza, founder of the Gen Z research and strategy firm The Up and Up.\n\nDr. Corey Seemiller, a generational expert who’s written six books about Gen Z, agreed, saying she doesn’t expect Erika Kirk to be some kind of “massive draw” to young women, especially “if she continues to put forth the same message that Charlie Kirk did.”\n\n“The messaging that’s resonating with Gen Z women is really different than the messaging that’s resonated with Gen Z men,” she noted, saying the demographic is shaping up to have one of the biggest political gender divides in generations.\n\nThat’s evident from recent elections. In 2024, young women ages 18-29 chose then-Vice President Kamala Harris over Trump by an 18-point margin. Men in that age group swung significantly the other way, choosing Trump over Harris by a 14-point margin.\n\nKey to Charlie Kirk’s success luring young men to MAGA was his “shock appeal,” Seemiller said. “Charlie Kirk didn’t hold back, and young men were like, ‘Yes, finally, someone’s saying something for me. He’s speaking my language.’”\n\n“Can Erica Kirk be that same thing?” she asked. “I don’t think women are looking for that.”\n\nWhat Gen Z women actually care about\n\nAcross the political spectrum, Gen Z women have very different feelings about marriage, children and metrics for success than both Erika Kirk and their male counterparts do. \n\n“This idea of finding that partner because you don’t want to go through life solo is definitely not something women are embracing in bulk, by any stretch,” Seemiller said of Gen Z women.\n\nRecent data she’s gathered showed that while 23% of Gen Z men said they wanted to get married to avoid being alone, just 13% of women in that age group said the same.\n\nAnd among members of Gen Z who said they don’t want to get married, 56% of women cited a desire to be independent, compared to just 41% of men, her data showed. Among that group, 24% of women cited an opposition to combining finances, while just 17% of men said the same.\n\n“We’re not seeing any indicators that these women are leaning on these ‘head of household’ men who would take care of them financially,” Seemiller observed. \n\nEven within Turning Point’s target demographic of young, right-leaning voters, the differences in men and women’s priorities are astounding ― especially when it comes to one of the Kirks’ biggest mandates: have children.\n\nIn September, an NBC News poll that broke down Gen Z’s priorities by both sex and Trump vs. Harris, voters found that while Gen Z men who voted for Trump ranked having children as their No. 1 marker of success, their female counterparts ranked it sixth among their 13 choices. And while those men ranked being married fourth, those female Trump voters ranked it ninth. \n\nIn another twist, Gen Z women who voted for Trump ranked achieving financial independence higher than both groups of men and female Harris voters, placing it at No. 1.\n\nThe findings track with what Janfaza hears in the gatherings she holds with young voters.\n\n“I hear in my listening sessions with Gen Z women a strong focus on financial stability and financial freedom as the top thing that they’re prioritizing when they think about metrics for success in their future,” she said.\n\nIt doesn’t seem like Erika Kirk grasps any of that. In a recent interview, she appeared utterly perplexed that so many young women voted for New York Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, a candidate who ran on affordability and America’s cost-of-living crisis. In remarks that were widely panned on social media, she called the Democrat’s victory “so ironic and so interesting” and mused that young women were asking things of their government they should be seeking from a marriage.\n\n“What I don’t want to have happen is women, young women, in the city look to the government as a solution,” she said. “To put off having a family or a marriage, because you’re relying on the government to support you, instead of being united with a husband, where you can support yourself and your husband can support [you], and you guys can all combine together.”\n\nAuthenticity matters to young people — a lot \n\nThere’s an elephant in the room working against Erika Kirk.\n\nBefore becoming the CEO of a nonprofit with tens of millions of dollars in assets and making multiple media appearances a week, Erika Kirk lectured young women on the importance of being a “helpmate” to their husbands instead of focusing on their own careers. \n\n“Your husband has to be the one that goes out into the world and builds and battles and comes home. Conquers,” she said in an April 2025 episode of “The Charlie Kirk Show” while sitting next to her husband. “[He] comes home and is like, ‘This is my nest egg, this is what I worked so hard for,’ and the wife is like, ‘Welcome home, babe, whatever you need, we’re here.’”\n\nEven before becoming CEO, she was a businesswoman with a podcast, a clothing line and multiple degrees.\n\nDuring an appearance onstage at a Turning Point USA event over the summer, she cautioned it wasn’t “ideal” to get married after 30 and that it’s “not probably the best statistical-odd position.”\n\nErika Kirk was 32 when she married Charlie Kirk, who was five years her junior.\n\nThat’s a hypocrisy that may not jive with young women or men. \n\n“Young people as a whole, especially Gen Z, are about authenticity,” Leela Strong, the director of Tufts’ Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement, a research organization focused on youth civic engagement, told HuffPost. \n\n“They want candidates and figureheads who can speak to substantive issues,” who understand “those issues they’ve personally experienced,” she said.\n\nSeemiller agreed, saying the weight Gen Z gives to authenticity from leaders is one of the “biggest findings” about the age group.\n\nJanfaza emphasized the same: “Anyone looking to connect with Gen Z needs to be real and clear about their day-to-day, how they spend their time and their own priorities.”\n\nYoung women are also experiencing the creep of “tradwife” content on social media from creators “making millions of dollars by encouraging people to not make money,” Seemiller observed, and it’s not really landing with them.\n\n“Gen Z women are seeing right through that,” she said.\n\nShe expects Turning Point USA will eventually attempt to package the incongruence.\n\n“It’ll be spun to be that she believes in this so much that she has to get other people to do it,” Seemiller said. Or, she predicted, they will emphasize her husband’s death, pushing a narrative that “she wouldn’t have stepped up, but because her husband died, she feels a calling to keep the mission going.”\n\nErika Kirk hasn’t addressed the hypocrisy criticisms. But at a recent CBS town hall appearance, she asserted her authenticity.\n\n“We’re fully transparent,” she said when talking about her decision to give a live statement following Charlie Kirk’s shooting.\n\n“What you see,” she promised, “is what you get.”","url":"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/erika-kirk-turning-point-usa-gen-z_n_6925f13ae4b063285310f023?origin=home-politics-feed-unit","image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/6925f1181900007f306a0012.jpg?cache=UCG4evNNhM&ops=1778_1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-20 11:00:17","author":"Lydia O'connor","authors":["Lydia O'connor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.124},{"id":387795536,"title":"Elise Stefanik, loyal Trump ally, ends New York  governor bid and will leave politics","text":"Elise Stefanik was the youngest woman ever elected to the House of Representatives in 2014.

She will have GREAT success, and I am with her all the way!\"\nStefanik, the youngest woman ever elected to the House in 2014, moved sharply to the right after Trump's first presidential victory in 2016. She has led efforts to expose how elite US colleges, including New York's Columbia University, responded to campus protests over the Gaza war.\nThe president nominated her as ambassador to the UN at the start of his second term in January 2025 but withdrew her name amid concerns about Republicans' narrow House majority.\nWhile Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris won New York by a comfortable 12-point margin over Trump in 2024, the state shifted more toward Trump than any other in the nation from 2020 to 2024. But Democrats dominated several high-profile elections in November, including in New York City and nearby New Jersey.\nStefanik's district is not seen as competitive in next year's midterm elections, when Democrats will seek to take control of the House. Incumbent presidents' parties typically lose House seats in midterm elections.\nHochul, 67, was the state's lieutenant governor in 2021 when then-Governor Andrew Cuomo resigned amid sexual harassment allegations, elevating her to the governorship.

He added, “The online comment threads of Twitter might preach that our lineage is our strength. No, I’m sorry, our lineage is not our strength. Our true strength is what unites us across that diversity and through that lineage.” Mr Ramaswamy, who shaped his political identity with a series of books and media appearances denouncing left-wing “woke” ideology, has become perhaps the most visible target of a right-wing ideology — sometimes labelled “blood and soil” nationalism, a Nazi slogan that was used in Germany and has resurfaced among white supremacists globally. It is a worldview shaped by intolerance of immigrants, and those from India are one of the latest targets. “Older Republicans who may doubt the rising prevalence of the blood-and-soil view should think again,” he wrote in an opinion article in The New York Times this week. “My social media feeds are littered with hundreds of slurs, most from accounts that I don’t recognise,” he wrote. He went further on Friday, saying that people who cannot denounce hateful ideas toward any ethnic group “without stuttering” do not have a “place as a leader at any level in the conservative movement.” In recent weeks, mainstream conservatism has been rocked by a series of incidents that have highlighted bigotry within its ranks. In mid-October, flagrantly racist, antisemitic and homophobic texts exchanged by young Republicans came to light. Weeks later, the conservative commentator Tucker Carlson, who remains close to President Trump and Vice President JD Vance, sat down for a friendly interview with Nick Fuentes, an openly racist and antisemitic white nationalist. When the president of the Heritage Foundation, Kevin Roberts, released a video refusing to criticise Mr Carlson, senior officials and board members at the conservative think tank resigned in protest. Now, Mr Ramaswamy is highlighting a new pressure point facing his party, surging intolerance toward Indian Americans. “This is deeply personal to me,” he said in a text to The Times. “It isn’t really about defending Jews, Indians, or any other minority group. It’s about defending the essence of America itself.” Derogatory slurs that were once seen only in extreme, right-wing pockets of the internet are becoming more mainstream, as are claims that Indians are “stealing American jobs,” according to organisations tracking online hate. “The hateful rhetoric we are seeing right now is nothing like we have seen before,” said Raqib Hameed Naik, the executive director of the Washington D.C.-based Centre for the Study of Organised Hate, a nonprofit that tracks online extremism. Mr Ramaswamy spotlighted that surge this week when he revealed the anti-Indian slurs dogging his campaign for governor and argued in The New York Times article that being an American has nothing to do with one’s ancestry. Instead, he said, any U.S. citizen who vows allegiance to the country is an American so long as they “believe in the rule of law, in freedom of conscience and freedom of expression, in colorblind meritocracy, in the U.S. Constitution, in the American dream.” That was a direct challenge to “national conservatism,” whose adherents include prominent Republicans, including Mr Vance, who gave a speech this summer in which he worried that if being an American meant simply adhering to an ideal, “let’s say, of the Declaration of Independence,” American identity “would include hundreds of millions, maybe billions, of foreign citizens.” “At the same time,” the vice president continued, defining citizenship purely as adhering to the principles of the nation’s founding documents would exclude many on the right who don’t subscribe to those principles and whose “own ancestors were here at the time of the Revolutionary War.” In his opinion article, Mr Ramaswamy took what seemed to be a veiled shot at Mr Vance, who responded in October to outrage over the young Republicans’ racist texts by saying, “I refuse to join the pearl clutching.” “The point isn’t to clutch pearls,” Mr Ramaswamy wrote, “but to prevent the gradual legitimisation of this un-American animus,” condemning a “reluctance from my former anti-woke peers to criticise the new identity politics on the right.” Far from sparking introspection, Mr Ramaswamy’s piece flushed out the bigotry he condemned. Mr Fuentes said on social media that “foreigners who have no right to be here don’t get to lecture me about what it is to be American.” Andrew Torba, the founder of Gab, a social media hotbed for intolerance, said in a more-than-2,000-word response that the notion that anyone could become an American is “the most destructive lie ever told about American identity.” Anti-immigrant rhetoric, including against South Asians, is not new. But it surged in 2024, when the presidential cycle for the first time featured two Indian American candidates, Mr Ramaswamy and Nikki Haley, and a Black and South Asian Democratic nominee in Kamala Harris. Mr Vance’s wife, Usha, an Indian American and practising Hindu, has become a particular target, said Stephanie Chan, director of data and research for Stop AAPI Hate, a group that monitors and responds to anti-Asian discrimination. A fierce debate within the Trump administration this year over visas for highly skilled immigrant workers sparked still more anti-Indian rhetoric. Posts on X that featured anti-Indian slurs, stereotypes or narratives like “deport Indians” garnered 280 million views over about two months earlier this year, Mr Naik’s group found. Over the last month, he said, another 29,000 mentions of such language has appeared on X, which Elon Musk purchased in 2022. Mr Ramaswamy is among a small contingent of conservatives who say the movement needs to protect itself from fringe ideologies like that of Mr Fuentes’ groypers. Ben Shapiro, a conservative commentator, warned in a speech to the Heritage Foundation this week that “if conservatives do not stand up and draw lines, conservatism and the dream of America itself will cease to exist.” According to a recent survey from the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank, almost a third of Republicans under the age of 50 openly express racist or antisemitic views, a finding based on a poll of about 2,800 mostly Republican voters. Manjusha Kulkarni, executive director of Stop AAPI Hate, said the anti-Indian rhetoric has been driven partly by policies of Mr Trump, such his moves to limit H-1B visas, a program that has historically allowed 85,000 skilled workers, the vast majority of whom are Indian nationals, to work in the United States each year. “It’s essentially about collective punishment against communities based on perceived threats,” she said. Indian Americans have become the largest subgroup within the Asian American population among people who identify with one country of origin, and are on average the wealthiest and most educated. Six members of Congress are of Indian origin as is the newly elected mayor of New York City, Zohran Mamdani, who also faced significant vitriol online targeting his identity as a Uganda-born Muslim of Indian descent. “There’s never been a prouder moment to be an Indian American,” Representative Ro Khanna, Democrat of California, said. Mr Khanna, who said he has been targeted online because of his heritage, applauded Mr Ramaswamy for denouncing the forces of intolerance instead of “pandering” to them. Mr Ramaswamy made the leap from business to politics by denouncing “wokeness” — a vaguely defined term many Republicans use to describe what they see as a liberal policing of speech involving minority groups. With books, media appearances and a presidential campaign, he amplified the issue of “wokeism” and encouraged a backlash. But in his Times essay, he lamented what he called a natural consequence of that backlash: more people celebrating what they see as a historical bond of white people to America’s founding. Earlier this year, Mr Vance delivered a speech at the Claremont Institute, a conservative think-tank, in which he painted America in starkly different terms than Mr Ramaswamy. “I think that people whose ancestors fought in the Civil War have a hell of a lot more claim over America than the people who say they don’t belong,” he said. Representative Pramila Jayapal, Democrat of Washington, said she has been a target of anti-immigrant sentiment and that attacks have increased during her nearly nine years in Congress. She recalled conversations from two decades ago with immigrants employed at Microsoft who she said at that time felt somewhat immune from ostracism because of their status. Now, she said, immigrants like them feel vulnerable. “People understand this is an attack on all of us,” she said, “as Indian Americans, as immigrants, as naturalised citizens.”","url":"https://www.business-standard.com/world-news/vivek-ramaswamy-challenges-conservatives-on-surging-bigotry-on-the-right-125122000383_1.html","image":"https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2025-02/25/full/1740445962-5427.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-20 08:33:46","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.129},{"id":387777040,"title":"Silent Trump flees growing storm over Epstein 'cover-up' as he jets off for holidays without ANY comment","text":"President Donald Trump remained silent amid accusations of a 'cover-up' after the release of thousands of files related to convicted pedophile Jeffery Epstein.\n\nThe president hyped the economy while speaking at a rally in North Carolina on Friday night but refused to address the growing outrage over his refusal to release all the documents related to Epstein.\n\nThe Department of Justice released more than 300,000 pages of evidence connected with the case - including images of Bill Clinton, Michael Jackson and Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell. \n\nHowever, there are still many files that were left redacted in defiance of Congress. There has been rampant speculation that the administration was protecting powerful people implicated in Epstein's crimes.\n\nAfter the rally, Trump flew to Mar-a-Lago amid a growing chorus of criticism from both Democrats and Republicans. \n\nRepublican Thomas Massie and Democrat Ro Khanna - who pushed to release the files - said that Trump's release was insufficient.\n\n'Unfortunately, today’s document release by [Attorney General Pam Bondi] grossly fails to comply with both the spirit and the letter of the law that @realDonaldTrump signed just 30 days ago,' Massie wrote. \n\nCongresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez called for Attorney General Pam Bondi to resign. \n\n'Now the coverup is out in the open,' Ocasio-Cortez said. 'Protecting a bunch of rapists and pedophiles because they have money, power, and connections. Bondi should resign tonight.' \n\nRepublicans like Nancy Mace and Marjorie Taylor Greene were also unsatisfied with the release. \n\nMace tweeted out several hours after the drop: 'RELEASE THE EPSTEIN FILES'\n\nGreene called the redactions 'not MAGA' and said the insufficient drop had some Republicans 'raging and walking away.' \n\nCNN anchor Jake Tapper took out his phone and scrolled through hundreds of blacked out pages while live on air.\n\n'It’s all black. It’s just 100 pages of redaction,' Tapper complained. 'That’s the transparency we’re getting here.'\n\nAt least six of Epstein's victims have broken their silence to express disappointment with the files released by the Trump administration. \n\nMarina Lacerda, one of the women who claims she survived sexual assault by Epstein beginning when she was 14 years old, said she wanted to see greater transparency. \n\n'Just put out the files,' she said. 'And stop redacting names that don't need to be redacted.'\n\nJess Michaels, one of Epstein's earliest known victims, had similar concerns in a discussion with The New York Times. \n\n'They are proving everything we have been saying about corruption and delayed justice,' she said. 'What are they protecting? The coverup continues.'\n\nThe president commented briefly on failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton during the rally, noting that it was more fun to beat her in the election than Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024.\n\n'She's nasty. I wouldn’t want to go home to her,' Trump said about Hillary Clinton. \n\n'She was a nasty b—person. I was going to use a ‘B’ word but my wife would not be happy.'\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton was seen in released images from Epstein's estate while relaxing in a swimming pool and sitting on a plane with a woman. \n\nTrump appeared to be mentioned just once in the files. It was alleged that Epstein introduced Trump to a 14-year-old girl at Mar-a-Lago where Trump said, 'This is a good one, right?'\n\nTrump has insisted that he banned his former friend Epstein from his Florida estate once he discovered the financier was trafficking young women.\n\nEarlier on Friday, Trump hosted an event in the Oval Office to talk about lower prescription drug prices but did not take questions from the press.\n\nHe also ignored the press as he left the White House and boarding Air Force One for North Carolina.\n\nMore than 600,000 pages related to the pedophile have now been released this year, prompting the Trump administration to describe itself as the 'most transparent in history' following Friday's disclosure.\n\nThe Justice Department has said additional materials will be unsealed and released before the end of the year.\n\nThe DOJ posted the documents on its website, organizing the material into four separate data sets.\n\nThe trove includes images from Epstein's homes, including rooms adorned with nude photographs and distinctive bright blue carpeting.\n\nClinton protested the release of the photos, as a spokesman accused the DOJ of 'shielding' President Trump and 'stalling' the full release.\n\n'Everyone, especially MAGA, expects answers, not scapegoats,' the statement read.\n\nOthers accused the Justice Department of redacting too many details in the released documents.\n\nDeputy Attorney General Todd Blanche insisted that the redactions were necessary to protect the identities of victims.\n\n\"The only redactions being applied to the documents are those required by law — full stop,' he told Fox News. 'There are no redactions of famous people.'\n\nSenior Trump officials reacted on social media to some of the photos of Clinton.\n\n'Oh my!' exclaimed Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, on X in reaction to the photos.\n\n'Jumpman, Jumpman, Jumpman… that boy up to somethin,' wrote White House Communications Director Steven Cheung, sharing a photo of Clinton with a woman who's identity was redacted on X. \n\nAn initial review indicates the documents released today originate from three separate investigations into Jeffrey Epstein's crimes against young women.\n\nMany of the files appear to stem from a 2005 police investigation in Palm Beach, Florida, followed by a federal probe that culminated in Epstein's controversial 2008 plea deal.\n\nOthers relate to a later investigation launched by Manhattan prosecutors in 2019 - a case that was never finished after Epstein died in jail while awaiting trial.\n\nBeing named or pictured in the files is not necessarily an indication of wrongdoing in relation to Epstein. \n\nAhead of the release on Friday, President Trump refused to answer questions about the release of the documents after an event with pharmaceutical company executives in the Oval Office on Friday, saying he didn't want to 'spoil' the event by allowing the media to ask 'questions having to do with anything else.'\n\n'I won't even take questions today, because there's no way I can take questions that are anywhere comparable to what you just witnessed,' Trump declared. \n\nFriday's dump of documents also revealed that Epstein once received a novelty check for $22,500 from Trump. \n\nThe name in the signature line reads very different from Trump's famous signature these days, but clearly reads in the designated space 'D. Trump.' \n\nThe memo line was mostly covered by a redaction box and a similarly black-boxed woman stood beside a grinning check-wielding Epstein who donned a 'USA' crew neck.\n\nThe image is a black and white scan of a framed photo that repeatedly reads along the edges the phrase 'once in a blue moon.'\n\nSo far, it's the only piece of new information found linking Trump to Epstein.\n\nThere is a publication in the files of Epstein's contact book, which includes a redacted entry for Trump. It's already known that the president was among those who appeared in Epstein's contact list.\n\nTrump said he banned Epstein from Mar-a-Lago in 2007 and said they hadn't spoken in years.

Now now now! Take his fucking head off you prick! Teach him a fucking lesson!”\n\nWhat lesson? What might we learn from the young people who, every eight weeks or so, fill Rochester’s Casino Rooms, Kent’s largest nightclub, for evenings of violence?\n\nYou do not do this – mixed martial arts – without good reason. The Bloodline Fight Series is an amateur affair. The cage fencing is looser than it should be, so instead of bouncing back into the ring, retreating fighters fall back into an evil hammock, cradled in place for the knees and fists of their opponents. After one pummelled victim threw up, the canvas was roughly mopped, and the next fight began almost immediately. \n\nNone of Bloodline’s competitors will make a living from fighting. If there were any chance of that, they would not be here. After fights they come out to the smoking area, their faces cherried and lit up. Alfie Smith grinned at me with an eye swollen shut and offered a hand still wrapped in boxing tape. He had lost his fight, but it had been “Lovely! Brilliant!” He would do it again, “100 per cent!”\n\nRochester’s centre celebrates the fallen of the Second World War and Charles Dickens’s historic residence. Under red, white and royal blue bunting on the high street, you can visit Oliver’s restaurant, Little Dorrit’s piercings studio, Sweet Expectations sweet shop, Peggotty’s Parlour, and Tiny Tim’s all-day breakfast. \n\nBut it is easy to stray off the edge of the postcard. In 1998, Rochester became the first city in the history of the UK to fail to protect, then lose, its status as a city. Outside the Casino Rooms is a fragment of the castle wall built a millennium ago to keep out invaders. From the castle, you see chalk cliffs, much like those along the English Channel, which in the first half of this year saw 19,982 illegal immigrants land by small boats. Other than Clacton, now Nigel Farage’s constituency, Rochester and Strood is the only seat that Ukip ever won. After that by-election, in November 2014, Emily Thornberry, Labour MP for Islington South and Finsbury, attracted opprobrium after posting an “image from #Rochester”. The picture showed a terraced house with a white van outside and the St George’s cross hanging from the window. Earlier this month, a Rightmove survey found Rochester to be the fourth-most unhappy place to live of the 220 locations surveyed.\n\nIn the garden of the Ye Arrow pub on the afternoon before the fights, talk (“Fuck off! If that’s Watermelon Ice, I’m Chinese!”) subsided into applause as a fighter arrived. Lucas Dunia, a self-employed scaffolder, flexed his biceps and joined his friends. It was to be his first fight. With a shaved head, Venum-branded MMA clothing, a lean face and a non-alcoholic beverage, Dunia looked distinct in the pub garden – more glamorous and more intent than the rest.\n\nHours later, Dunia used his back to defend a tackle with a headlock. Wriggling free from the subsequent attempt on his neck, he gave away his arm, by which he was pulled back down to the mat. His opponent mounted his back – decisively this time – and wrapped his elbow across Dunia’s neck. If held, such chokes can kill people. Dunia kept breathing until just ten seconds remained in the fight, at which point he submitted by “tapping out” on his opponent’s arm.\n\nIn MMA, fans find something like truth. As Dunia suffocated, a child in front of me zoomed his iPhone camera in on the fighter’s skull. A map of veins emerged on his skin: life brought to the surface. On the large screen high on the wall was a quotation from Dana White, CEO of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), the largest MMA promotion company in the world. “Fighting is in our DNA. We get it and we like it.”\n\nThis has been a weekend of popular violent spectacle. This Friday (19 December), Watford-born boxing champion Anthony Joshua fought American influencer Jake Paul. Tonight (20 December), Luton-born manosphere guru Andrew Tate, who first rose to prominence as a kickboxer, will fight another American influencer, Chase DeMoor. Those contests are boxing, because it is easier for influencers to learn, but MMA is the ascendant combat sport of 21st-century Britain. The number of UK MMA gyms increased 32-fold between 2009 and 2019. The sport is especially popular among the young: in one survey, almost a quarter of 18- to 34-year-olds called themselves fans of the sport.\n\nIn fact, you can understand MMA’s popularity by examining how it differs from the sport it replaces. When MMA emerged, boxing had long been the most popular combat sport. Modern boxing still follows conventions issued in Victorian Britain. The Queensbury Rules, drafted in London in 1865 and endorsed by the 9th Marquess of Queensberry, aimed to instil sportsmanship and fair play. They prohibited all wrestling and insisted that a fallen fighter have ten seconds unassisted to recover. “You must not fight simply to win,” the rules instructed, “no holds barred is not the way; you must win by the rules.” \n\nIn MMA, fighters may wrestle, kick, elbow, knee, grapple, strike downed opponents and the backs of heads – none of which is permitted in boxing. In July 2019, a fight ended after five seconds: wrestler Ben Askren ducked for his opponent’s legs; striker Jorge Masvidal leapt for his opponent’s face. A flying knee hit a diving skull and Askren fell into a flat, rigorous sleep. As is standard, Masvidal rained hammer fists on to Askren’s skull until a referee pushed him off.\n\nAs MMA became more popular, boxing advocates derided it as a less skilful version of their sport. In 2007, Floyd Mayweather said cage fighters were “guys who didn’t make it in our sport”. Several MMA fans directed me to a video of Joe Rogan, who has been a UFC commentator since the company’s early days, arguing with a boxing promoter. Rogan dismissed boxing’s rules as arbitrary inhibitions: to say “we hate each other, we’re gonna fight, we’re gonna duke it out man to man – but we’re only going to use our hands” was, for Rogan, “a silly agreement”.\n\nAnd MMA fans always had another, blunter argument: theirs was a truer, more effective violence – they would win in a fight. A young man at a London UFC event this June told me that only an MMA fighter could walk into a room and declare, “No one here is a threat to me.” In boxing’s Eighties heyday, Mike Tyson was nicknamed the “baddest man on the planet.” In 2023, heavyweight champion Tyson Fury (named after Mike) was ridiculed for claiming the same mantle. Fury once said he could beat a UFC heavyweight “in a room, on our own.” Yet, facing down a much smaller MMA fighter soon after, he quailed. “I ain’t going in no cage! I’m a straight-up boxer. Queensberry rules!” For all its claims to being “the sweet science,” boxing’s legitimacy rested on its approximation of real, lawless violence – but it was displaced by a closer match.\n\nIn America, fighting doesn’t just have an audience – it has a politics. At UFC events, President Donald Trump has received the ring walk of a superstar fighter. After the most gifted fighter of all time, Jon Jones, left his opponent, Stipe Miocic, broken on the canvas in November 2024, he mimicked Trump’s signature dance and then offered his heavyweight championship belt to the President, who was ringside, having won the election just 11 days earlier. American liberals call the UFC a gateway drug to right-wing radicalisation – while to Maga, it is something of a national sport. Both phenomena are young, macho and violent; the synergies are clear.\n\nThe President is connected personally to the UFC’s top brass. When Trump appeared in West Palm Beach, Florida, to accept his victory over Kamala Harris, he was followed on to the stage by four family members – and then by Dana White. Weeks earlier, Trump had appeared on the podcast of UFC commentator Joe Rogan, who endorsed him days later. At the dawn of the UFC, Rogan was a little-known comedian providing commentary for free, and in 2001, White could not find venues that would host his shows. Trump offered his Trump Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City. As he told the UFC Unfiltered podcast: “They couldn’t get a venue because of the danger. People thought it was so dangerous… I supplied them with a venue.”\n\nBut there is also a textural match between Trumpian populism and MMA. Both surged past complacent incumbents with irreverence and brutal tactics that flouted established rules. As each succeeded, their supporters felt a collective glee at the sight of ancient, revered, complacent disciplines humiliated by franker methods. It felt, to fans, like a triumph of honesty. Rogan has said that what fans like about MMA is how clearly one can tell winners from losers. Next year, on the 250th anniversary of Independence Day, there are plans to host a UFC event on the White House lawn.\n\nThe UFC met resistance when it first came to the UK in 2002. Labour MP Derek Wyatt protested: “We have been campaigning against fox hunting, bear-baiting and cockfighting, and this is the human equivalent.” Today, MMA is hugely popular in the UK. The UFC heavyweight champion, Tom Aspinall, is from Salford. The company made its 30th UK visit in June this year, filling London’s O2 Arena. The cheapest tickets on the night were £283.25.\n\n“Fucking love MMA,” a young fan at the O2 told me. “It’s the ultimate form of fighting.” Another, who had done an amateur fight himself, said MMA was “the most unpredictable, exciting sport there is.” The arena’s satellite venues advertised smaller, local fighting promotions. In a pub during the preliminary fights, a dad squealed in horror and pointed his daughters to a screen, where a deep gash above one fighter’s eye was visible.\n\nBut if Britain has a similar appetite for MMA, the political consequence is much less clear. It is hard to know, for instance, which party could speak to the Bloodline fans.\n\nThe moniker “Britain’s hardest MP” belongs to Labour. Will Stone, MP for Swindon North, is a former rifleman in the British Army and a jiu jitsu fighter. He saw Starmer as a leader who could realistically take power and “get things done.” When we met in Westminster’s Portcullis House, Stone cheerily told a member of his team, “He wants me to assault him!” – then delivered an MMA leg kick on me. He claimed it was only “20 per cent,” but the kick nonetheless produced a concussive sequence of blooming, psychedelic pains in my leg and then my gut, disabling me for much of the morning.\n\nWhen I asked if Labour had a firm purchase on martial sentiment, Stone had a neat answer: “Well, I’ve got the Union Jack tattooed on my bicep.” But it is harder than that to deny that frustrated political energies in Britain have generally been flowing to Reform, not least in Rochester. In this year’s May Kent County Council elections, the party took 57 of 81 seats, wiping out a Conservative majority that had held for almost three decades. The county is something of an unofficial heartland for the insurgent party: Labour won Rochester and Strood in 2024, but only because Reform and the Conservatives split their vote.\n\nLauren Edwards, the MP, declined to speak to me; her team expressed concerns that a piece including Reform and Bloodline would be too negative. The new chair of the local Green Party, supposedly the repository for disaffected young voters, was forthright enough to tell me that Reform’s policies “not only will not work, they are talking absolute shit.” But she conceded that she had never spoken to anyone who had, for instance, put up St George’s crosses this summer or attended Bloodline.\n\nIn June, the local Reform branch held a meeting in the George pub. Outside, a biker with a “Skinhead” badge sewn onto his leather jacket sat near homemade poppies. Attendees voiced frustrations about the NHS and immigration. There was a sense of momentum at the meeting, with hopes that Lee Anderson would attend the coming “BBQ & Banter” event. But one demographic was still markedly absent. There was an appeal for help recruiting young members through debating clubs, beach picnics, and football matches – they wanted “all the youngsters you know.” Reform, it seems, also doesn’t know where Rochester’s young people are.\n\nTThe young people who congregated at Bloodline weren’t interested in conventional politics. Across the road from the Casino Rooms was an abandoned social club; across the bridge, the local Reform branch looked deserted, piled with dust, unopened mail and forsaken coffee cups. One lifelong resident was supporting his friend in the 18th fight. I asked which party was in government. “I wouldn’t even know, mate,” he said.\n\nOne 18-year-old I spoke to was excited to spot gymfluencer Willow Gait – known for her “get-dressed-with-me” videos – in the audience. But when I asked him about politics, he replied: “Piers Starmer? I ain’t know that dude. No one knows who the fuck that is. I thought it was still Boris Johnson. Everyone knew him because he was a meme. Is it not Michael Farage?”\n\nIf politics is the resolution of conflict without bloodshed, then the Bloodline fans were well past politics. There was no sense that the state might improve their lives. All their instinct for struggle flowed inward, toward training themselves. Asking about parties and policies, I felt about as relevant as Dickens’s Miss Havisham, who had sat frozen in time in a house five minutes from the Casino Rooms, “lost in contemplation of the ashy fire.”\n\n“Politics? They don’t care,” Christopher “Granite Chin” Garnett told me of the young people who come to his gym, Chatham’s Granite Gym, housed in a disused 11th-century church. MMA has “absolutely nothing to do with politics,” Garnett said. His students ranged from “police officers and estate kids,” and you might joke with an opponent, “Oh yeah, I bet you’re one of the stop-the-boats fellas, aren’t you!” But though all sorts enter his gym, Garnett noted, “What I’ve noticed over the years is this: anxiety is a thing.”\n\nAdvocates of MMA often elaborate on how the discipline empowers trainees to improve their lives. But Bloodline felt more nihilistic than that. Garnett said that when he looks at new students and realises, “you want to close that gaping hole of insecurity that you’ve got,” he always wonders, “Shall I tell them? It won’t go away.” Blows to the skull and the restriction of oxygen to the brain offer not amelioration but absorption, or, at best, acceptance. This isn’t American UFC, with its triumphal Coliseum that Donald Trump surveys like a Caesar and fighters who become millionaires. It’s something sadder.\n\nBefore Lucas Dunia tapped out to the choke, the air was frantic with possibility. His limbs flailed, and his coaches screamed out escapes he might try. After he submitted, there was a sudden calm, and it seemed, obviously and peacefully true, that there had never been any escape. Fighting offers brutal honesty and honest brutality, but its extreme violence is a gentler introduction than others to man’s destructibility. It was Dunia’s first ever fight; he stood up disappointed, but less disappointable.\n\nAlfie Smith, the young fighter who had lost his match but would fight again, was not sad because he had lost, but happy because he had fought. “It is what it is, bruv. I left everything in there. I put everything in.” As the night’s 20 or so bouts flowed past, his meaning became clearer: the results mattered less, the action more. Bloodline was not about winning. It was not even really about not losing. It was just about fighting.\n\n[Further reading: The English have begun to hate]","summary":"Why are young males across England fighting each other every Saturday?","url":"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/society/2025/12/kentish-berserk-why-young-males-england-fighting","image":"https://dl6pgk4f88hky.cloudfront.net/2025/12/18/z246_173-800x418.jpg?1766276380","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-20 02:00:00","author":"David Hornback,George Monaghan","authors":["David Hornback","George Monaghan"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.098},{"id":387765334,"title":"Elise Stefanik, loyal Trump ally, ends New York governor bid and will leave politics","text":"Dec 19 (Reuters) - U.S. Representative Elise Stefanik, a House Republican leader and loyal ally of President Donald Trump, said on Friday she was bowing out of politics, including her recently announced bid for governor of New York, to spend more time with family. Stefanik, 41, the fourth-ranking member of her party in the House of Representatives as House Republican Conference chair, said she was halting the gubernatorial campaign she announced in November and would not seek re-election to Congress. When her current term representing New York's upstate 21st congressional district expires in January 2027, she will have served 12 years in office on Capitol Hill. Stefanik's announcement came after her Republican rival in the gubernatorial primary, Nassau County executive and fellow Trump ally Bruce Blakeman, paid to air a blitz of campaign ads on Fox News over the holidays - not in New York, but in West Palm Beach, Florida, home of Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence. Trump has previously expressed consternation at having to choose between two allies to challenge New York's incumbent Democratic governor, Kathy Hochul, next November. \"They're two fantastic people, and I always hate it when two very good friends of mine are running, and I hope there's not a lot of damage done,\" the New York Times quoted him as telling reporters recently. While voicing confidence that she would have \"overwhelmingly won\" that race, Stefanik added in her announcement, \"it is not an effective use of our time or your generous resources to spend the first half of next year in an unnecessary and protracted Republican primary, especially in a challenging state like New York.\" Stefanik went on to say that throughout her time in Congress, her \"most important title is Mom.\" \"I believe that being a parent is life's greatest gift and greatest responsibility,\" she wrote. \"I have thought deeply about this and I know that as a mother, I will feel profound regret if I don't further focus on my young son's safety, growth, and happiness - particularly at his tender age.\" A short time after Stefanik bowed out, Trump acknowledged Stefanik's announcement on his Truth Social online platform, writing: \"Elise is a tremendous talent, regardless of what she does. She will have GREAT success, and I am with her all the way!\" Stefanik, the youngest woman ever elected to the House in 2014, moved sharply to the right after Trump's first presidential victory in 2016. She has led efforts to expose how elite U.S. colleges, including New York's Columbia University, responded to campus protests over the Gaza war. The president nominated her as ambassador to the United Nations at the start of his second term in January 2025 but withdrew her name amid concerns about Republicans' narrow House majority. While Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris won New York by a comfortable 12-point margin over Trump in 2024, the state shifted more toward Trump than any other in the nation from 2020 to 2024. But Democrats dominated several high-profile elections in November, including in New York City and nearby New Jersey. Her district is not seen as competitive in next year's midterm elections, when Democrats will seek to take control of the House. Incumbent presidents' parties typically lose House seats in midterm elections. Hochul, 67, was the state's lieutenant governor in 2021 when then-Governor Andrew Cuomo resigned amid sexual harassment allegations, elevating her to the governorship. She won a full four-year term in 2022.

Everything is going up. You can't afford food because you can't afford rent. Utilities are too high. Gas is too expensive. Everything is too expensive.\" \n\nBisbal was sipping an afternoon coffee at the Hamilton Family Restaurant not long after Vice President JD Vance rallied Republicans in a nearby suburb. In the Trump administration's second high-profile trip to Pennsylvania in a week, Vance acknowledged the affordability crisis, blamed it on the Biden administration and insisted better times were ahead. He later served food to men experiencing homelessness in Allentown. \n\nThe visit, on top of several recent speeches from President Donald Trump, reflects an increasingly urgent White House effort to respond to the economic anxiety that is gripping both parties. Those worries are a vulnerability for Republicans in competitive congressional districts like the one that includes Allentown, which could decide control of the U.S. House in next year's midterms.\n\nBut in confronting the challenge, there are risks of appearing out of touch.\n\nOnly 31% of U.S. adults now approve of how Trump is handling the economy, down from 40% in March, according to a poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Yet Trump has called affordability concerns a \" hoax \" and gave the economy under his administration a grade of \"A+++++.\" Vance reiterated that assessment during his rally, prompting Bisbal to scoff.\n\n\"In his world,\" Bisbal, a self-described \"straight-up Democrat,\" responded. \"In the rich man's world. In our world, trust me, it's not an 'A.' To me, it's an 'F,' 'F,' 'F,' 'F,' 'F,' 'F.'\"\n\nAgreement that prices are too high\n\nWith a population of roughly 125,000 people, Allentown anchors the Lehigh Valley, which is Pennsylvania's third-largest metro area. In a dozen interviews this week with local officials, business leaders and residents of both parties, there was agreement on one thing: Prices are too high. Some pointed to gas prices while others said they felt the shock more at the grocery store or in their cost of health care or housing. \n\nFew shared Trump's unbridled boosterism about the economy. \n\nTony Iannelli, the president and CEO of the Greater Lehigh Valley Chamber of Commerce, called Trump's grade a \"stretch,\" saying \"we have a strong economy but I think it's not yet gone to the next stage of what I would call robust.\" \n\nTom Groves, who started a health and benefits consulting firm more than two decades ago, said the economy was at a \"B+\" as he blamed the Affordable Care Act, widely known as \"Obamacare,\" for contributing to higher health costs and he noted stock and labor market volatility. Joe Vichot, the chairman of the Lehigh County Republican Committee, referred to Trump's grade as a \"colloquialism.\"\n\nFar removed from Washington's political theater, there was little consensus on who was responsible for the high prices or what should be done about it. There was, however, an acute sense of exhaustion at the seemingly endless political combat. \n\nPat Gallagher was finishing lunch a few booths down from Bisbal as she recalled meeting her late husband when they both worked at Bethlehem Steel, the manufacturing giant that closed in 2003. Now retired, she, too, relies on Social Security benefits and lives with her daughter, which helps keep costs down. She said she noticed the rising price of groceries and was becoming exasperated with the political climate. \n\n\"I get so frustrated with hearing about the politics,\" she said. \n\nAllentown has a front-row seat to politics \n\nThat feeling is understandable in a place that often gets a front-row seat to the national debate, whether it wants the view or not. Singer Billy Joel's 1982 song \"Allentown\" helped elevate the city into the national consciousness, articulating simultaneous feelings of disillusionment and hope as factories shuttered.\n\nIn the decades since, Pennsylvania has become a must-win state in presidential politics and the backdrop for innumerable visits from candidates and the media. Trump and his Democratic rival in 2024, Kamala Harris, made several campaign swings through Allentown, with the then-vice president visiting the city on the eve of the election. \n\n\"Every race here, all the time,\" Allentown's mayor, Democrat Matt Tuerk, recalled of the frenzied race last year.\n\nThe pace of those visits -- and the attention they garnered -- has not faded from many minds. Some businesses and residents declined to talk this week when approached with questions about the economy or politics, recalling blowback from speaking in the past. \n\nBut as attention shifts to next year's midterms, Allentown cannot escape its place as a political battleground.\n\nTrump's win last year helped lift other Republicans, like U.S. Rep. Ryan Mackenzie, to victory. Mackenzie, who unseated a three-term Democrat, is now one of the most vulnerable Republicans in Congress. To win again, he must turn out the Republicans who voted in 2024 -- many of whom were likely more energized by Trump's candidacy -- while appealing to independents.\n\nMackenzie's balancing act was on display when he spoke to the party faithful on Tuesday, bemoaning the \"failures of Bidenomics\" before Vance took the stage at the rally. A day later, the congressman was back in Washington, where he joined three other House Republicans to rebel against the party's leadership and force a vote on extending health care subsidies that expire at the end of the year.\n\nVichot, the local GOP chairman, called Mackenzie an \"underdog\" in his reelection bid and said the health care move was a signal to voters that he is \"compassionate for the people who need those services.\"\n\nA swing to Trump in 2024\n\nLehigh County, home to Allentown and the most populous county in the congressional district, swung toward Trump last year. Harris' nearly 2.7 percentage point win in the county was the tightest margin for a Democratic presidential candidate since 2004. But Democrats are feeling confident after a strong performance in this fall's elections when they handily won a race for county executive. \n\nRetaking the congressional seat is now a top priority for Democrats. Gov. Josh Shapiro, who faces reelection next year and is a potential presidential contender in 2028, endorsed firefighter union head Bob Brooks this week for the May primary.\n\nDemocrats are just a few seats shy of regaining the House majority and the first midterm after a presidential election historically favors the party that's out of power. If the focus remains on the economy, Democrats are happy. \n\nThe Uline supplies distribution factory where Vance spoke, owned by a family that has made large donations to GOP causes, is a few miles from the Mack Trucks facility where staff was cut by about 200 employees this year. The company said that decision was driven in part by tariffs imposed by Trump. Shapiro eagerly pointed that out in responding to Vance's visit.\n\nBut the image of Allentown as a purely manufacturing town is outdated. The downtown core is dotted by row homes, trendy hotels and a modern arena that is home to the Lehigh Valley Phantoms hockey team and hosts concerts by major artists. In recent years, Latinos have become a majority of the city's population, driven by gains in the Puerto Rican, Mexican and Dominican communities. \n\n\"This is a place of rapid change,\" said Tuerk, the city's first Latino mayor. \"It's constantly changing and I think over the next three years until that next presidential election, we're going to see a lot more change. It's going to be an interesting ride.\"","url":"https://nationalnewswatch.com/2025/12/20/trumps-a-economy-collides-with-reality-in-a-pennsylvania-city-critical-to-the-midterms","image":"https://assets-nnw.nationalnewswatch.com/articles/_1200x630_crop_center-center_82_none/b41ea59cf5b7105f279cca5872ed53faa02d5c7f6358b2b14842474f0740d8ca.jpg?mtime=1766240108","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-20 00:00:00","author":"Steven Sloan","authors":["Steven Sloan"],"language":"en","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.217},{"id":387759444,"title":"Elise Stefanik drops out of N.Y. governor's race 6 weeks after bid","text":"Dec. 19 (UPI) -- enRepublican U.S. House Rep.

I have thought deeply about this and I know that as a mother, I will feel profound regret if I don't further focus on my young son's safety, growth, and happiness - particularly at his tender age.\"\n\nHer main primary opposition was Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman, who announced his run 10 days ago.\n\n\"However, as we have seen in past elections, while we would have overwhelmingly won this primary, it is not an effective use of our time or your generous resources to spend the first half of next year in an unnecessary and protracted Republican primary, especially in a challenging state like New York,\" Stefanik wrote.\n\nThe last Republican governor in New York was George Pataki, who served three terms from 1995 to 2006.\n\nThe last time a Republican presidential candidate won New York was in 1984, when incumbent Ronald Reagan defeated Democrat Walter Mondale.\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris won the state by 13 points, down from former President Joe Biden's 23-point victory in 2000.\n\n\"Elise Stefanik has finally acknowledged reality: If you run against Governor Kathy Hochul, you are going to lose,\" Hochul spokesperson Ryan Radulovacki told Politico. \"As Donald Trump raises costs on New Yorkers and targets this state relentlessly, Governor Hochul has cut middle-class taxes, put money back in New Yorkers' pockets, and fought this administration and won when New York has come under attack.\"\n\nStefanik has represented the rural conservative upstate New York district since 2014, becoming the youngest woman ever elected to Congress at that time.\n\nThe 21st Congressional District covers the northernmost part of the state, bordering Canada to the north and Vermont to the east. Major cities include Plattsburgh, Watertown, Glens Falls, Ogdensburg and Rome.\n\nIn November 2024, she was overwhelmingly re-elected by 24 percentage points as Trump carried the conservative region by more than 20 points.\n\nWhen President Trump was elected president last November, he nominated her to serve as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. But the nomination was pulled because of the narrow Republican edge in the House, with Trump saying it was \"essential that we maintain EVERY Republican seat in Congress.\"\n\nHochul would have called for a special election.\n\nRepublicans now have a 220-213 advantage with two vacancies in seats by Democrats who have died.\n\nStefanik rose in House leadership, serving as the fourth-ranking House Republican, a position she first attained in May 2021 by replacing Liz Cheney. She was succeeded in this specific role by Lisa McClain for the 119th Congress.\n\nAfter her nomination was pulled, Speaker Mike Johnson named her chairwoman of House Republican Leadership.\n\nShe originally was a critic of Trump but became one of his most vocal allies.\n\nStefanik fell a little out of favor with the president after she called New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani a \"jihadist.\"\n\nDuring a meeting with Mamdan in the White House, the president reduced to label the Democratic socialist that description. He is a Muslim and South Asian.\n\nTrump hadn't endorsed either candidate, including when Stefanik was in the White House's Oval Office when he signed legislation awarding the 1980 U.S. Olympic ice hockey team the Congressional Gold Medal. The teams won the gold medal in Lake Place, which includes Stefdanik's district.\n\nEd Cox, chairman of the New York Republican Party, endorsed Blackman after Stefanik's decision. In a statement, he also said Stefanik would \"remain a leader in our party and a powerful voice for our principles. We respect her decision and thank her for her efforts.\"\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt served as Stefanik's communications director from 2020-23.\n\n\"Elise Stefanik has been an incredible advocate for the people of her district in Upstate New York, and she will always be a true friend to President Trump,\" she posted on X. \"On a personal note, Elise is my former boss. She is a great leader, and an even better person. We love you, posted.","summary":"Republican U.S. House Rep.

That project led to real changes in the RNC's approach to organizing and messaging. Some of those lessons got eclipsed by the sui generis nature of the Donald Trump phenomenon in 2015, but others – especially the funding of precinct-level organizing – stuck. \n\nThe RNC deliberately made the autopsy public from the start; it served as the catalyst for my book Going Red. It also forced the Republican Party to make the changes necessary to compete in presidential elections, with accountability as leverage. Without a public accounting of what went wrong, there would have been no pressure to make corrections that addressed the real issues of that failed campaign. \n\nThat brings us to the Democratic National Committee's response to their catastrophic 2024 presidential campaign. Having lost against an opponent that not only beat them but triumphed over their hysterical attempts to disqualify him, the DNC commissioned an autopsy of their own. And then ... they buried it along with the body. \n\nTwo months later, Democrats want answers, Axios reports:\n\nDemocratic officials and strategists blasted the Democratic National Committee on Thursday for withholding its autopsy of the party's loss in the 2024 presidential election, despite repeatedly pledging to release it.Why it matters: Several Democrats — including many advising possible 2028 presidential candidates — said burying the report unfairly helps former Vice President Harris if she runs again, and shields top party consultants by hiding potentially damaging information about their efforts.\"Kamala Harris certainly benefits from not having an open discussion\" about the 2024 campaign, said Jeff Weaver, Sen. Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign manager in 2016 and top adviser in 2020 who's a frequent critic of the DNC.Mike Casca, chief of staff to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, a potential 2028 presidential contender, asked whether everyone who worked on the DNC report committed to not working on a 2028 campaign. \"Seems like a problem to me,\" he added.\n\nYeah, well, maybe. The problem with this theory is the idea that withholding the autopsy would do Harris any good. Harris hasn't won a truly competitive election in her life, and the 2024 general election demonstrated why. Harris is a politician whose electoral success has always \"depended on the kindness of strangers,\" to quote Blanche DuBois in Tennessee Williams's A Streetcar Named Desire. As Harris herself stupidly detailed in her own memoir 107 Days, she utterly failed even when anointed as the nominee and spotted $1.5 billion in campaign funds. \n\nJohn identified the next issue with this theory two months ago:\n\nThe short answer to the question in my headline [about the report's release] is maybe. The slightly longer answer is that no one really cares and the report has been written in such a way that it won't matter anyway. ...There won't be any acknowledgement of the fact that Democrats had a mainstream media eager to proclaim Joe Biden the winner of every debate. Unfortunately, Biden was so old that he embarrassed himself in front of the entire country. Who can forget?If choosing a candidate who can complete a sentence isn't part of the autopsy report, it's useless.\n\nIts uselessness is almost certain, because any useful report would have to center on the fraud committed by Democrats over the four years of the Biden Regency. They lost the election in large part – but not entirely – because they conspired to keep a senile old man in the Oval Office while others exercised his authority in violation of the Constitution. The entire party then conspired to rig the 2024 primaries to prevent any real challenge to the Biden Regency, only to see it blow up in the June 27, 2024 debate on prime-time TV. Rather than conduct an open convention to choose an effective nominee, the same conspirators picked one of their own – Harris – to keep the lid on one of the worst political violations in US presidential history. \n\nDoes anyone believe that the DNC would allow an autopsy that even hinted at the truth to be made public? \n\nThe other reason Democrats lost is that they got too high on their own progressive supply and lost ground in the middle. That at least would be solvable if Democrats were willing to fix it. They aren't, however; they just want to win elections without appealing to the icky and problematic voters who live outside their progressive epistemic bubble. Even if their autopsy only looked at this issue, the progressive-elite-run DNC would never let that conclusion see the light of day, either. \n\nIt doesn't matter much, anyway. Everyone already knows the reasons Democrats lost in 2024. We don't need to read an internal autopsy to figure that out. However, their determination to bury any criticism of the hard-Left nutcases that run the party reveals their refusal to learn, and especially to change. \n\nEditor’s Note: Every single day, here at Hot Air, we will stand up and FIGHT, FIGHT, FIGHT against the radical left and deliver the conservative reporting our readers deserve.

Why It Matters The release of the Jeffrey Epstein files under the Epstein Files Transparency Act represents a pivotal moment in a case that has gripped public attention for years and has threatened the reputations of many famous people. President Donald Trump signed a mandate into law requiring the release of the files, and advocates argue that the historic release will offer Americans new insight into one of the most significant scandals involving sex trafficking and abuse of underage girls by powerful figures in business, science, politics, and entertainment. What To Know On Friday, the Department of Justice began releasing hundreds of thousands of files linked to Epstein, the financier whose connections with prominent individuals and criminal activities led to multiple federal probes and global headlines. The initial tranche includes emails, photographs, flight logs, and estate records. The law requires public disclosure of all unclassified Epstein-related records, with redactions for victims' identities and material tied to ongoing investigations. It should be noted that individuals named in the documents are not necessarily accused of wrongdoing. The files contain correspondence, travel logs, and social interactions, much of which has already been referenced in previous investigations or court proceedings. Many of those revealed as Epstein's associates have denied any knowledge or participation in his criminal activities. Among the public figures and celebrities named in the documents are: The inclusion of these names reflects a range of connections, from socializing and professional correspondence to private meetings. Many names, including Clinton and Trump, have appeared repeatedly in litigation and press coverage of the Epstein case. Epstein’s ties with high-profile figures span decades. Flight logs and emails reference attendees and guests at gatherings at his various properties. Documents include testimony from survivors, depositions with associates, and email exchanges with politicians and entrepreneurs. Some disclosures, such as photographs showing Trump, Clinton, and others, have been made public through Congressional committees and media investigations. Many of those named have issued prior statements denying any involvement in Epstein's crimes or knowledge of his activities. What People Are Saying Democratic Representative Ro Khanna, who sponsored the Epstein Files Transparency Act, told CBS News: “The fact they are even releasing hundreds of thousands of these is a historic moment for survivors across our nation.“ Former Vice President Kamala Harris voiced skepticism about the completeness of the release, telling Jimmy Kimmel: “The agency has been treated 'like a personal law firm.'” Angel Ureña, spokesperson for former President Clinton, told The Guardian: “President Clinton knows nothing about the terrible crimes Jeffrey Epstein pleaded guilty to in Florida some years ago, or those with which he has been recently charged in New York.” What Happens Next The Department of Justice plans to continue releasing additional documents in accordance with the Epstein Files Transparency Act. Survivors’ advocates continue to call for full transparency, while several named individuals may face renewed scrutiny regarding the nature of their interactions with Epstein. Congressional oversight committees are expected to review the redaction process and may call additional witnesses. The Justice Department is required by law to submit to Congress a list of any redacted or withheld documents within 15 days of public release and is prohibited from withholding records exclusively for reasons of ‘embarrassment or political sensitivity.’ Update 12/19/25 5:50 p.m. ET: This article has been updated with additional information.","summary":"Several celebrities were mentioned in the new Epstein documents released on Friday.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/list-of-celebrities-mentioned-in-new-jeffrey-epstein-files-11246115","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/michael-jackson.png?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-19 22:52:20","author":"Jenni Fink,Peter Aitken","authors":["Jenni Fink","Peter Aitken"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.134},{"id":387801760,"title":"Elise Stefanik ends her short-lived bid for New York governor and won’t seek reelection to House","text":"Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik announced Friday she was ending her short-lived bid for governor of New York and would not run for another term in Congress. “While spending precious time with my family this Christmas season, I have made the decision to suspend my campaign for Governor and will not seek re-election to Congress,” Stefanik wrote in a post on social media. “I did not come to this decision lightly for our family.” The announcement came less than two months after Stefanik launched a campaign seeking to challenge Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul in 2026, making what would have been a long-shot race in a heavily Democratic state. Stefanik recently drew a primary competitor in Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman, whom she invoked in her statement. “While we would have overwhelmingly won this primary, it is not an effective use of our time or your generous resources to spend the first half of next year in an unnecessary and protracted Republican primary, especially in a challenging state like New York,” Stefanik wrote. Stefanik’s upstate congressional district is conservative terrain, with the congresswoman winning reelection last November by 24 points and Trump carrying it by more than 20 points. Those margins are outside the average Democratic overperformance in House special elections this year and would make it a reach for the party in its pursuit to flip control of the chamber next year, when it needs a net gain of only 3 seats to win the majority. The abrupt move brings yet another twist in Stefanik’s political arc. It’s unclear what she will do next, but for now, she is set to leave elected office in early 2027. “Elise is a tremendous talent, regardless of what she does. She will have GREAT success, and I am with her all the way!” President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social. Once a Trump critic, Stefanik rose to national prominence with her questioning of witnesses during Trump’s first impeachment and became one of his highest-profile supporters on television and on the campaign. She strongly backed his 2024 bid for the White House, urging the party “to unite around the most popular Republican in America.” Stefanik had moved up the ranks of the party’s House leadership and with Trump’s return to the White House, she was nominated for the position of US ambassador to the United Nations. Her nomination was later pulled as the GOP navigated a narrow majority with Trump saying at the time it was “essential that we maintain EVERY Republican seat in Congress.” That left her to stay in the US House, with at least one plan for a farewell toast to her scrapped and her old leadership position already taken by GOP Rep. Lisa McClain of Michigan. She entered the New York governor’s race accusing Hochul of not doing enough to reduce costs in the state or fight antisemitism, seeking to link the incumbent to New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist who will become the city’s first Muslim mayor. But Trump wouldn’t endorse Stefanik before or after Blakeman entered the field. And in a chummy Oval Office meeting with Mamdani, Trump declined to agree that Mamdani was a “jihadist” – undercutting a key Stefanik attack line. “She’s out there campaigning,” Trump told reporters, “and you say things sometimes in a campaign.” Whoever wins the Republican nomination will face an uphill climb in New York, a solidly Democratic state, though one where Trump made significant inroads in 2024. Former Vice President Kamala Harris carried the state by less than 13 points, down from former President Joe Biden’s 23-point victory there four years earlier. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt also gave kudos to her former boss, whom she worked for as communications director. “Elise Stefanik has been an incredible advocate for the people of her district in Upstate New York, and she will always be a true friend to President Trump. On a personal note, Elise is my former boss. She is a great leader, and an even better person. We love you, @EliseStefanik!” Leavitt posted. Hochul was able to fend off a challenge from current EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin in the 2022 governor’s race, winning a full term by less than 7 points after replacing former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who resigned in 2021. Republicans have not won a statewide race in New York since 2002. The chair of the New York Republican Party, Ed Cox, released a statement saying Stefanik would “remain a leader in our party and a powerful voice for our principles” while also endorsing Blakeman and urging other party leaders in the state to follow suit. “Bruce is a fighter who has proven he knows how to win in difficult political terrain,” Cox said.

I'm 59-years-old. I'm at the very front edge of the Gen X'ers, but I identify as a Baby Boomer. I missed the cut-off by about two years. I fully recognize that every generation, by the time they get to my advanced years, begins telling stories about how the generation following them just aren't the same as they were when they were growing up. With Millennials, I've discovered that this generational axiom has the added benefit of being true. Millennials have become the punchline of a lot of jokes. The rap on these current 28-44-year-olds are that they're lazier than the generation before them, not too motivated to make their own way in the world, very self-centered, and generally gloomy about what the future holds for them. My son is 35-years-old, right in the heart of this cohort of Americans, and just provided me with a year's worth of stand-up material with his pre-Thanksgiving trip to see me alone.After reading this Savage article, complete with tons of stats and anecdotes accumulated from tons of first-person interviews, I now understand why Millennials in general are the way they are. And there is a ton of opportunity for J.D. Vance in 2028, assuming he's the Republican nominee after Secretary of State Marco Rubio all but cleared the field. The article is about the incredible damage DEI policies have had on the employment prospects, and the resulting psychological impact, on Millennial white males trying to make their mark writing in the world of media. It's obviously a niche industry, but it's a microcosm of the ongoing devastation of DEI policies that took root during the Obama presidency and crescendoed after the death of George Floyd in 2020. Savage, a fledgling writer trying to break through writing television pilots and pitching them to studios to turn into series, tells this story. \n\nBut of course, by 2016, we were already too late. The showrunner emailed us back apologetically. “I had initially thought I might be able to bring you guys on,” he wrote, “but in the end it wasn’t possible.” We met with the executive anyway—a Gen-X white guy—who told us how much he loved our pilot. But the writers room was small, he explained apologetically, and the higher-level writers were all white men. They couldn’t have an all-white-male room. Maybe, if the show got another season, they’d be able to bring us on. They never did. The doors seemed to close everywhere and all at once. In 2011, the year I moved to Los Angeles, white men were 48 percent of lower-level TV writers; by 2024, they accounted for just 11.9 percent. The Atlantic’s editorial staff went from 53 percent male and 89 percent white in 2013 to 36 percent male and 66 percent white in 2024. White men fell from 39 percent of tenure-track positions in the humanities at Harvard in 2014 to 18 percent in 2023. In retrospect, 2014 was the hinge, the year DEI became institutionalized across American life.\n\nBefore you dismiss this as a lefty writer complaining that DEI policies he probably supported backfiring on him, this is a much, much bigger story than this one job market. Countless white males coming out of college or high school in the mid-10's, regardless of their political ideology, if they held any ideology at all, ran into a brick wall where career opportunities, and ultimately their chance at the American dream, were taken away from them for the sake of diversity hires. In 1974's Blazing Saddles, there was a scene where the railroad workers were brought in to cut a deal with the all-white residents of Rock Ridge to build a fake city in order to thwart the evil Hedley Lamarr, played by Harvey Korman. I'll clean up the language to make it FCC-compliant, but the offer by the townfolk was, \"All right, we'll give land to the Blacks and the Asians, but we don't want the Irish.\" That wasn't an acceptable deal, and finally, everybody was included in the opportunity of a stake of land. That's what's happening here, except the Democrats who implemented DEI policies across education, law enforcement, law, and much of corporate America, still don't want the Irish. Whites need not apply. \n\nThis may be how Boomer and Gen-X white men experienced DEI. But for white male millennials, DEI wasn’t a gentle rebalancing—it was a profound shift in how power and prestige were distributed. Yet practically none of the thousands of articles and think-pieces about diversity have considered the issue by cohort. This isn’t a story about all white men. It’s a story about white male millennials in professional America, about those who stayed, and who (mostly) stayed quiet. The same identity, a decade apart, meant entirely different professional fates. If you were forty in 2014—born in 1974, beginning your career in the late-90s—you were already established. If you were thirty in 2014, you hit the wall.\n\nTo those of us on the right, DEI was an issue that became a political bludgeon for Donald Trump, and as president, signed two executive orders to end wasteful DEI programs and preferences in government agencies, and another one to end illegal discrimination based on race and restroring merit-based opportunities in states and entities like colleges and universities that receive federal funding. It was a principled fight that Donald Trump campaigned on, and it was a promise on which he delivered. DEI certainly hit its peak in 2020 after George Floyd, but is sadly still far too entrenched in way too many sectors of the economy. What I failed to understand is not just what discrimination it did to conservatives trying to make their way in the world, but what it has done to disillusion 30-something males who might otherwise be liberals, but not so much anymore. From the tail end of Savage's piece, which I would recommend you read every word and share it with others: \n\nMost of the men I interviewed started out as liberals. Some still are. But to feel the weight of society’s disfavor can be disorienting. We millennials were true believers in race and gender-blind meritocracy, which for all its faults—its naïveté about human nature, its optimism in the American Dream—was far superior to what replaced it. And to see that vision so spectacularly betrayed has engendered a skepticism toward the entire liberal project that won't soon disappear. “What troubles me is that a lot of thriving white millennial men have had to follow the Josh Hawley path, where you have to leave liberal America,” an old friend, the father of two biracial children, told me. “I don't want to do that. Liberal America is my home. But if everyone says, this is not the place for you, what are you supposed to do?”\n\nMost of the men he interviewed started out as liberals. Some still are. My gracious, but what an opportunity that provides to expand the base. Donald Trump made huge inroads with labor union workers, with Blacks, Hispanics, surburban women, lots of voting blocs that typically vote Democratic, but got very turned off by Joe Biden's regency and Kamala Harris' ridiculous 107-day word salad tour. Inflation was killing them, and there was no one else to blame but Biden-Harris policies. And Trump, X and Truth Social warts and all, at least demonstrated he could generate a pretty prosperous economy the first time around, so he was the better choice in 2024. In all likelihood, Vice-President Vance is going to be the nominee. Secretary Rubio told Vanity Fair he's not running in 2028, and outside of a possible run by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, the field is pretty open for Vance to get the nomination without too much trouble. On the Democratic side of the aisle, a knife fight is developing that should be hugely entertaining to watch. Former Transportation Secretary, Pothole Pete Buttigieg, wants a shot. Former Hillary Clinton and Obama senior staffer Rahm Emmanuel is going to get in. Gavin Newsom is running, both away from California and for the White House. There will be others. And as I wrote about earlier in the week, Axios is reporting that Kamala Harris is definitely gearing up for another run. Polling shows that among the Democratic potential contenders, Harris has a 11-point lead over her closest rival, Gavin Newsom. If the general election in November of 2028 turns into a Vance V. Harris contest, it will literally be a Millennial white male with the ability to articulate and communicate policies, and a vision for the future in a way the Republican Party hasn't seen since...ever. Ronald Reagan could communicate, he certainly had a vision for the future, but he wasn't in the age cohort of a field of voters Millennials make up that are currently available for harvest. Who would Vance be running against? Kamala Harris, who is literally and figuratively the embodiment of a DEI hire. She was chosen by Joe Biden to fulfill a promise of picking a Black female as his number two. Harris was not a merit-based pick. She was picked because she was thought by the Biden team to be the Black female that would do them the least harm. And she failed to cross even that low bar.\n\nJob number one for whomever is running nationally for the Republicans, whether it's a Senate or House candidate in the midterms, or anyone running for the White House in '28, is to talk about the economy and affordability, and counter the narrative media and Democrats are spinning that we're in the worst economic environment ever becuase of Trump policies. Trump spoke to the nation Wednesday night and reeled off facts about job growth, lower energy costs, and how the housing market is improving now that illegal immigration is no longer creating an artificially high demand for units, driving up prices. All that is very good. But there's more that the next Republican for president, presumably Vance, needs to add to the agenda. The disillusionment on the left after what they believed in failed them makes these Millennial white males willing to listen, if Vance can resonate how the best way to achieve the equality they really want is equal access to opportunity, not government and corporations picking winners and losers based on skin color or gender in order to achieve equity. Replace the lost opportunies with words and actions to expand opportunities will reap electoral benefits to such a degree that Democrats won't know what hit them on Election Night. The Late Charlie Kirk used to be very, very good at that messaging to college-aged kids all over the country. He may have been the best in the conservative movement ever to be able to reason with young people, but a close second is Vance. When he spoke at a TPUSA event at Ole Miss a couple days before Halloween, it was a masterclass performance. The big question is will Vance, or someone around him, show him this Savage article, and will Vance grasp the political upside available to him and the skill set for communication he possesses? The good news is yes, he does. \n\nA lot of people think \"DEI\" is lame diversity seminars or racial slogans at NFL games. In reality, it was a deliberate program of discrimination primarily against white men. This is an incredible piece that describes the evil of DEI and its consequences:https://t.co/fMiIfvz0qz— JD Vance (@JDVance) December 17, 2025\n\nThere are lots of doomsayers on the right who think Republicans are headed for disaster in the midterms unless they get back to talking about the core issues of economics and affordability.

Sure, one could say that about any year, but between all of the unhinged moments that went down these past 12 months across pop culture — particularly those relating to musicians — it feels especially true for 2025.\n\nThat’s why Billboard is taking a second to recap 10 of the most insane things that occurred in the music and entertainment world this year, from mega-viral videos that had the internet talking for weeks to huge award-show wins, engagement announcements (hi, Tayvis!) and one pop star who literally brought pop to the stars by going to space — not to mention a certain animated group of K-pop singers who took over TV screens and the charts this year, all while fighting demons on the side.\n\nBut first, a moment for the honorable mentions. While Harry Styles didn’t perform or release music this year, he did make headlines repeatedly for popping up in the most random locations, including Tokyo and Berlin to run the casual marathon and Vatican City to watch the very first American Pope formally ascend to the top of the Catholic church. Cardi B started dating NFL star Stefon Diggs and had a baby with him in the span of months, while BTS finally reunited on camera after its seven members finished their respective military enlistments, and LeAnn Rimes’ teeth fell out on stage.\n\nPlus, Donald Trump crashed out over unsubstantiated theories regarding Bruce Springsteen and Beyoncé’s involvement in Kamala Harris’ campaign, Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo finally finished their two-year promotional run for the Wicked movies — encountering an aggressive prankster on the Singapore premiere red carpet along the way — and Diddy’s federal trial ended with the disgraced Bad Boy Records founder getting sentenced to four years in prison for prostitution charges. We could go on and on!\n\nAt the end of the day, though, only 10 landmarks in this year’s crazy pop culture timeline could make it on the list — and it’s time to get to them. Without any further adieu, check out Billboard‘s top wildest musical moments that will always be remembered about 2025 below.\n\n‘Say, Drake’\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nif ( !window.pmc.harmony?.isEventAdScheduledTime() ) {\npmcCnx.cmd.push(function() {\n\nsettings: {\n\npmcAtlasMG: {\niabPlcmt: 2,\n\nplayerId: '4057afa6-846b-4276-bc63-a9cf3a8aa1ed',\nplaylistId: '190d23fd-88b6-41bd-92b4-50d96f566e9a',\n}).render(\"connatix_contextual_player_div\");\n\n// This should only be get called when page cache is not cleared and it's event time.\nwindow.pmc.harmony?.switchToHarmonyPlayer();\n\nKendrick Lamar‘s record-breaking Super Bowl Halftime Show was memorable for a variety of reasons, but no moment from his 10-minute show at Caesars Superdome in New Orleans in February took off online and in pop culture quite as much as his delivery of, “Say, Drake …” during “Not Like Us,” staring straight into the camera with a s–t-eating grin and his now-iconic bootcut jeans flaring at his ankles.\n\nWeeks later, Drake’s lawyers added the performance to Drizzy’s defamation lawsuit against Universal Music Group regarding the lyrics on Dot’s Billboard Hot 100 chart-topper. Lamar, however, would go on after the Super Bowl to win song and record of the year at the Grammys for “Not Like Us.”\n\nBeyoncé’s ‘Oh, S–t’ Moment at the Grammys\n\nImage Credit: Kevin Winter/Getty Images for The Recording Academy\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nif ( !window.pmc.harmony?.isEventAdScheduledTime() ) {\npmcCnx.cmd.push(function() {\n\nsettings: {\n\npmcAtlasMG: {\niabPlcmt: 2,\n\nplayerId: '4057afa6-846b-4276-bc63-a9cf3a8aa1ed',\nplaylistId: '190d23fd-88b6-41bd-92b4-50d96f566e9a',\n}).render(\"connatix_contextual_player_div\");\n\n// This should only be get called when page cache is not cleared and it's event time.\nwindow.pmc.harmony?.switchToHarmonyPlayer();\n\nAt long last, Beyoncé finally won album of the year at the Grammys when her Billboard 200-topping album Cowboy Carter took home album of the year. It was one of the biggest moments in the making in Recording Academy history, as the superstar’s lack of recognition in the major categories continued even as she became the institution’s winningest artist of all time in 2023.\n\nBut while the AOTY win was certainly Bey’s biggest feat of the night, her shocked reaction to hearing her name read off as the winner of best country album ended up being the most viral moment — one that remains a frequently used meme online as 2025 draws to a close.\n\nKaty Perry Goes to Space for 11 Minutes\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nif ( !window.pmc.harmony?.isEventAdScheduledTime() ) {\npmcCnx.cmd.push(function() {\n\nsettings: {\n\npmcAtlasMG: {\niabPlcmt: 2,\n\nplayerId: '4057afa6-846b-4276-bc63-a9cf3a8aa1ed',\nplaylistId: '190d23fd-88b6-41bd-92b4-50d96f566e9a',\n}).render(\"connatix_contextual_player_div\");\n\n// This should only be get called when page cache is not cleared and it's event time.\nwindow.pmc.harmony?.switchToHarmonyPlayer();\n\nIn April, Katy Perry joined Blue Origin’s very first all-woman flight crew, launching into space alongside Gayle King, Lauren Sanchez and more for a mission that lasted just 11 minutes or so. Their craft reached approximately 62 miles above Earth to fly through an area called the “Kármán line,” aka the imaginary boundary that divides our planet’s atmosphere and outer space.\n\nThe idea of a pop star traveling to the final frontier was wild enough on its own for the internet to go crazy over the mission, but Perry unveiling her Lifetimes Tour setlist in zero gravity and dramatically kissing the ground once she landed also fueled many posts and memes for weeks after the fact.\n\nMorgan Wallen Goes Back to ‘God’s Country’\n\nImage Credit: Will Heath/NBC via Getty Images\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nif ( !window.pmc.harmony?.isEventAdScheduledTime() ) {\npmcCnx.cmd.push(function() {\n\nsettings: {\n\npmcAtlasMG: {\niabPlcmt: 2,\n\nplayerId: '4057afa6-846b-4276-bc63-a9cf3a8aa1ed',\nplaylistId: '190d23fd-88b6-41bd-92b4-50d96f566e9a',\n}).render(\"connatix_contextual_player_div\");\n\n// This should only be get called when page cache is not cleared and it's event time.\nwindow.pmc.harmony?.switchToHarmonyPlayer();\n\nIt seemed that Morgan Wallen was eager to leave New York City after serving as musical guest on a spring episode of Saturday Night Live. The country star abruptly exited the final shot before cameras even cut, then proceeded to share a photo of his private plane with “Get me to God’s country” written over it shortly after his sudden departure.\n\nThe phrase spread rapidly through posts online from bemused onlookers and meme-makers alike, a cultural phenomenon Wallen quickly capitalized on by releasing a line of “God’s country” merch.\n\nJustin Bieber Stands on Business\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nif ( !window.pmc.harmony?.isEventAdScheduledTime() ) {\npmcCnx.cmd.push(function() {\n\nsettings: {\n\npmcAtlasMG: {\niabPlcmt: 2,\n\nplayerId: '4057afa6-846b-4276-bc63-a9cf3a8aa1ed',\nplaylistId: '190d23fd-88b6-41bd-92b4-50d96f566e9a',\n}).render(\"connatix_contextual_player_div\");\n\n// This should only be get called when page cache is not cleared and it's event time.\nwindow.pmc.harmony?.switchToHarmonyPlayer();\n\nIn telling off a group of paparazzi, Justin Bieber created one of the biggest memes of the year. “It’s not clocking to you that I’m standing on business, is it?” he says in a clip that went crazy viral in June, aggressively tapping his temple to show he wasn’t messing around.\n\nThe phrase immediately became a staple in the 2025 lexicon, with the singer’s wife, Rhode founder Hailey Bieber, writing on Instagram Stories after the release of Justin’s Daisies album, “Is it finally clocking to you f–king losers?”\n\nSabrina Carpenter Gets on All Fours\n\nImage Credit: Courtesy\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nif ( !window.pmc.harmony?.isEventAdScheduledTime() ) {\npmcCnx.cmd.push(function() {\n\nsettings: {\n\npmcAtlasMG: {\niabPlcmt: 2,\n\nplayerId: '4057afa6-846b-4276-bc63-a9cf3a8aa1ed',\nplaylistId: '190d23fd-88b6-41bd-92b4-50d96f566e9a',\n}).render(\"connatix_contextual_player_div\");\n\n// This should only be get called when page cache is not cleared and it's event time.\nwindow.pmc.harmony?.switchToHarmonyPlayer();\n\nWhen Sabrina Carpenter announced less than a year after dropping Short n’ Sweet that she’d be releasing another album, Man’s Best Friend, in August 2025, one element of the project quickly temporarily overshadowed the rest: its cover. The image of the pop star down on all fours with a man grasping her by the hair polarized audiences, sparking dramatic debate as to whether the image was empowering, degrading, or simply not that deep.\n\n“I was actually shocked, because I think between me and my friends and my family and the people that I always share my music and my art with first, it just wasn’t even a conversation,” she later told CBS Mornings of the backlash. “For what the album is, [the cover is] perfect for what it represents, and everything about it to me just felt so opposite of, like, the world ending.”\n\nColdplay Concert Gets Awkward\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nif ( !window.pmc.harmony?.isEventAdScheduledTime() ) {\npmcCnx.cmd.push(function() {\n\nsettings: {\n\npmcAtlasMG: {\niabPlcmt: 2,\n\nplayerId: '4057afa6-846b-4276-bc63-a9cf3a8aa1ed',\nplaylistId: '190d23fd-88b6-41bd-92b4-50d96f566e9a',\n}).render(\"connatix_contextual_player_div\");\n\n// This should only be get called when page cache is not cleared and it's event time.\nwindow.pmc.harmony?.switchToHarmonyPlayer();\n\nOne of the most inescapable moments on the internet this year was when two Coldplay concertgoers were caught on video reacting quite suspiciously to a kiss cam showing them looking cozy on the big screens at Gillette Stadium in Boston. After the pair turned away and ducked out of sight once their image flashed in front of the entire crowd, frontman Chris Martin joked, “Either they’re having an affair or they’re just very shy.”\n\nTurns out, the two individuals were Astronomer CEO Andy Byron — who has since resigned — and his company’s then-HR executive, Kristin Cabot, both of whom were married to other people at the time. In a New York Times piece published many months after the fact, Cabot explained that she had already been separated from her husband by then, and that nothing physical had gone on between herself and her boss before the concert.\n\n“I made a bad decision and had a couple of High Noons and danced and acted inappropriately with my boss,” she told the publication. “And it’s not nothing. And I took accountability and I gave up my career for that.”\n\nTaylor Swift Says ‘Yes’ to Travis Kelce\n\nImage Credit: Aeon/GC Images\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nif ( !window.pmc.harmony?.isEventAdScheduledTime() ) {\npmcCnx.cmd.push(function() {\n\nsettings: {\n\npmcAtlasMG: {\niabPlcmt: 2,\n\nplayerId: '4057afa6-846b-4276-bc63-a9cf3a8aa1ed',\nplaylistId: '190d23fd-88b6-41bd-92b4-50d96f566e9a',\n}).render(\"connatix_contextual_player_div\");\n\n// This should only be get called when page cache is not cleared and it's event time.\nwindow.pmc.harmony?.switchToHarmonyPlayer();\n\nAfter years of writing love songs, Taylor Swift finally got her own happy ending when Travis Kelce proposed to her in August. “Your English teacher and gym teacher are getting married,” the couple wrote on Instagram while announcing the news, leaving Swifties everywhere overjoyed.\n\nAs we learned later, the Kansas City Chiefs tight end popped the question right after he and Swift recorded their record-breaking New Heights podcast episode, during which the pop star had no idea a team of people was setting up their rose garden proposal backdrop right outside their house while she was discussing her The Life of a Showgirl album on the show.\n\n‘KPop Demon Hunters’ Slays the Charts\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nif ( !window.pmc.harmony?.isEventAdScheduledTime() ) {\npmcCnx.cmd.push(function() {\n\nsettings: {\n\npmcAtlasMG: {\niabPlcmt: 2,\n\nplayerId: '4057afa6-846b-4276-bc63-a9cf3a8aa1ed',\nplaylistId: '190d23fd-88b6-41bd-92b4-50d96f566e9a',\n}).render(\"connatix_contextual_player_div\");\n\n// This should only be get called when page cache is not cleared and it's event time.\nwindow.pmc.harmony?.switchToHarmonyPlayer();\n\nNothing could have prepared the world — or the Billboard charts — for KPop Demon Hunters, the animated Netflix children’s film that absolutely took over with its music. In addition to its corresponding album becoming the first movie soundtrack to ever have four songs simultaneously chart in the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100, “Golden” ruled atop the ranking for two weeks and spent 18 at No. 1 on the Billboard Global 200.\n\nPlus, “Golden” earned a historic Grammy nomination for song of the year and closed out 2025 as Billboard staff’s No. 1 song of the past 12 months, while KPop Demon Hunters remains the most-streamed flick of all time on Netflix.\n\nBad Bunny Enrages MAGA\n\nImage Credit: Will Heath/NBC via Getty Images\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nif ( !window.pmc.harmony?.isEventAdScheduledTime() ) {\npmcCnx.cmd.push(function() {\n\nsettings: {\n\npmcAtlasMG: {\niabPlcmt: 2,\n\nplayerId: '4057afa6-846b-4276-bc63-a9cf3a8aa1ed',\nplaylistId: '190d23fd-88b6-41bd-92b4-50d96f566e9a',\n}).render(\"connatix_contextual_player_div\");\n\n// This should only be get called when page cache is not cleared and it's event time.\nwindow.pmc.harmony?.switchToHarmonyPlayer();\n\nThe backlash to the announcement of Bad Bunny as 2026 Super Bowl Halftime Show was absolutely bonkers, infuriating people who weren’t keen on having a predominantly Spanish-speaking musician headline the gig. Even President Donald Trump had something to say about the choice, which he called “absolutely ridiculous,” and Turning Point USA announced plans to host an alternative halftime show featuring “anything in English.”\n\nBenito, however, has remained unfazed ahead of his showcase on Feb. 8, 2026. “I’m very happy,” he said in his opening monologue when hosting Saturday Night Live in October. “Especially for all the Latinos and Latinas in the whole world and here in the United States. The people who have worked to open doors. More than my accomplishment, it’s an accomplishment of all of us, demonstrating that our mark and our input in this country cannot be thrown out or erased.”\n\nGet weekly rundowns straight to your inbox\n\nWant to know what everyone in the music business is talking about?\n\nGet in the know on\n\nVisit Billboard Pro for music business news\n\nBillboard is a part of Penske Media Corporation. © 2025 Billboard Media, LLC.

We are heartbroken by this sudden loss, and we ask for privacy during this unbelievably difficult time.”\n\nTMZ reported that their bodies were “butchered” and that sources described the scene as being the crimes of a “mad man.”\n\nThe New York Times reported that investigators are still trying to determine the time of death, and that the Reiners may have been killed on Saturday, Dec. 13, 2025, or in the very early hours on Sunday.\n\nTMZ reported that when the Reiners’ bodies were discovered, rigor mortis had already set in, which usually begins between two and six hours after death.\n\nRelated: We Ranked Every Rob Reiner Movie—Here’s the One That’s Still a Perfect 10\n\nWho found Rob Reiner and his wife Michele Singer?\n\nAccording to PEOPLE, Rob and Michele’s daughter Romy Reiner found her parents after they were murdered.\n\nMore details emerged in a report from the New York Times, which revealed that a massage therapist who was scheduled to be at the house called Romy when she couldn’t get in. Romy then went to the Reiners’ family home, where she found her father’s body. She immediately left the premises and reportedly didn’t know her mother was also dead inside. She called police, then family friend Billy Crystal, who lived close by and came over to say a final farewell to his longtime collaborator and Michele.\n\nOn Wednesday, Dec. 17, 2025, Romy and her brother Jake Reiner released a statement about the slayings.\n\n“Words cannot even begin to describe the unimaginable pain we are experiencing every moment of the day,” they said. “The horrific and devastating loss of our parents, Rob and Michele Reiner, is something that no one should ever experience. They weren’t just our parents; they were our best friends.”\n\nThey continued, “We are grateful for the outpouring of condolences, kindness, and support we have received not only from family and friends but people from all walks of life. We now ask for respect and privacy, for speculation to be tempered with compassion and humanity, and for our parents to be remembered for the incredible lives they lived and the love they gave.”\n\nRelated: Why Rob Reiner Rejected the Title of ‘Hero’ Months Before His Death\n\nWhat time were police called to Rob Reiner’s house?\n\nMultiple reports state that paramedics and police were called to the Reiners’ home between 3:30 p.m. and 3:40 p.m. PT on Sunday, Dec. 14, 2025.\n\nWhere did Rob Reiner and Michele Singer live?\n\nThe Reiners lived in the wealthy enclave of Brentwood, located in the west side of Los Angeles county.\n\nAbout 42,000 people reside in the neighborhood, including LeBron James, Gwyneth Paltrow, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Dr. Dre and Disney CEO Bob Iger, as well as former vice president Kamala Harris and former second gentleman Doug Emhoff.

Simpson.\n\nRelated: Billy Crystal and Larry David Seen at Rob Reiner’s Home After His Death\n\nHow did Rob Reiner die?\n\nBoth Rob and Michele Singer Reiner’s causes of deaths were homicide: They reportedly died after an assailant slit their throats. TMZ reported that the slayings took place after a “heated argument” with their son Nick and that the bodies showed signs of “lacerations consistent with a knife.”\n\nProsecutors in the case specified in their formal charging of Nick Reiner that a knife was used to commit the murders.\n\nOn Dec. 17, 2025, the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner’s Office released documents stating that the couple died from “multiple sharp force injuries,” the New York Post reported. They reportedly suffered from stab wounds to their throats as well as other parts on their bodies.\n\nRelated: Ron Howard Mourns Rob Reiner With Powerful Tribute Hours After His Death\n\nWho killed Rob Reiner and his wife?\n\nNick Reiner, son of Rob Reiner and Michele Singer Reiner, was arrested in connection with their deaths, but is innocent until proven guilty.\n\nRelated: Nick Reiner Appears Unhappy in Photo With Parents 3 Months Before Tragedy\n\nWho was the last person to talk to Rob Reiner?\n\nWhile we don’t know the specific last person who spoke to Rob Reiner before his death, we do know that earlier that day and week, he was with friends and family who loved him.\n\nMonty Python star Eric Idle said he spoke to Rob the day before the director was murdered.\n\n“Rob Reiner was a lovely man. I spoke to him last night for over an hour,” Idle wrote on X (formerly Twitter) just after 1 a.m. PT on Monday, Dec. 15, 2025. “I always enjoyed his company. I met him at his Dad’s in 1975. He was telling me about fiming [sic] at Stonehenge and his thoughts for the future. This is so awful. I shall miss him. A clever, talented and very thoughtful man. So awful.”\n\nCinematographer Barry Markowitz told Page Six that he was likely one of the last people to see the Reiners alive, as he’d recently been staying with them in their Brentwood home. Markowitz said that the Reiners invited him to stay at their house when he was in town to promote one of his projects in November, and that at the time, it appeared Nick was “on the upswing” with his health.\n\n“He looked great. He was sitting and talking with the family,” Markowitz recalled. “They eat dinner together, old school, and a lot of love, always a lot of love … He helped out, he took out the garbage, he watched TV, he washed dishes. He’d bring me something to drink. He was just normal in that sense.”\n\nMarkowitz said he didn’t notice anything unusual and that the family was loving and normal. When asked about what he thought of Nick’s alleged behavior and if he believed he could murder his own parents, he replied, “It’s just a sickness. That’s my verdict.”\n\nRob, Michele and Nick Reiner all attended pal Conan O’Brien‘s holiday party on Saturday, Dec. 13, 2025, TMZ reported. The three of them reportedly had a “very loud argument” at the soiree, after which Rob and Michele went home. Sources claimed that Michele was lamenting to friends that she and Rob were struggling for several months to get Nick treatment for his addiction and mental health problems.\n\nRelated: The Chilling Message Rob Reiner Told the World Months Before His Murder\n\nWho is Nick Reiner?\n\nNick Reiner is the son of Rob Reiner and Michele Singer Reiner. He was a screenwriter and worked with his father on the 2015 film Being Charlie, which was loosely autobiographical. He reportedly periodically Nick lived at home with his parents, and TMZ reported that Nick left the family home on his own accord before the slayings.\n\nAt one point, Nick worked as an intern for the long-running Seth Macfarlane animated comedy Family Guy.\n\n“He was an intern on the show Family Guy for around three to six months. His father helped him get the gig,” a source told Page Six, adding that Rob “would drop him off” and “pick him up” from the job daily. The insider claimed that Nick would work for about four hours a day, but that he did little actual work, instead spending the bulk of his time “shooting the s**t” with his colleagues.\n\n“He did not work hard and he wasn’t a hard worker,” the insider claimed. “He was 100 percent entitled. There was really no responsibility for him because we didn’t have interns. It was a favor for Rob.”\n\nThe source called Nick “captivating” and said he had a dark sense of humor.\n\n“He was a funny kid. He was charismatic in a dark, introverted way. He was a goofy 20-year-old,” the insider said. “He was the black sheep. He felt like a f**k up. He knew that. He was self-aware of how his family was doing and how he represented them in a negative space. But none of that felt offensive or scary.”\n\n“He was coming off rehab, so he was sober,” the source added. “This was part of his path to recovery. His whole identity was being sober.”\n\nIn terms of the allegations that Nick murdered his parents, the insider said, “I am not that shocked. He is a troubled person. Nick had an aura of darkness around him with his addiction issues. When you have addiction and mental health, there is room for emotional murders … It doesn’t seem unfounded. He was a troubled kid from a young age and had issues. But that’s not the Nick I knew.”\n\nA source told PEOPLE that Nick struggled to find his own identity in the shadow of his famous father and grandfather (Carl Reiner, who died in 2020).\n\n“Nick wanted to live a life that didn’t exist. He was entitled,” the insider said. “He didn’t want to do any work but expected to be loved the way the rest of his family was.” The source added that Michele and Rob “felt enormous guilt for so long that they couldn’t help Nick get his life together … they could never reach stability with Nick. They tried everything—giving him space, keeping him close—but his struggles are so deep. It’s just a parent’s worst nightmare. They were such lovely people and tried in every way to help their son.”\n\nRelated: Does Nick Reiner Have Instagram? See the Private Account His Siblings Follow\n\nWhat did Nick Reiner suffer from?\n\nNick struggled with mental illness and addiction for much of his life, TMZ reported which at times left him homeless and often in and out of various rehabilitation centers and programs; his count as of 2016 was reportedly 17 stints. His substance abuse, and his family’s responses to it, deteriorated his relationship with his parents. Sources alleged to TMZ that prescription drugs especially “messed with [Nick’s] head.”\n\n“I was homeless in Maine. I was homeless in New Jersey. I was homeless in Texas,” Nick told PEOPLE in 2016. “I spent nights on the street. I spent weeks on the street. It was not fun … If I wanted to do it my way and not go to the programs they were suggesting, then I had to be homeless.”\n\n“When Nick would tell us that it wasn’t working for him, we wouldn’t listen,” Rob recalled to the Los Angeles Times in September 2015. “We were desperate, and because the people had diplomas on their wall, we listened to them when we should have been listening to our son.”\n\n“We were so influenced by these people,” Michele added at the time. “They would tell us he’s a liar, that he was trying to manipulate us. And we believed them.”\n\nFor his part, Nick said in a 2016 interview with Build Studios that he “didn’t really bond a lot” with his father when he was young. He also admitted (via the Los Angeles Times), “I had no identity, and I had no passions. I think the reason I had no identity was because I have a famous dad and a famous grandpa, and that fame sort of informs who you are. So I wanted to edge out my own identity with a more rebellious, angry, drug-addicted sort of persona.”\n\nIn 2018, Nick revealed that on the Dopey podcast that he’d once gotten so high that he completely trashed his parents’ guest house.\n\n“I got totally spun out on uppers,” he said. “I think it was coke and something else—and I was up for days on end. I started punching out different things in my guest house … started with the TV and then I went over to the lamp … everything in the guest house got wrecked.”\n\nIn September 2025, Rob told NPR that Nick was doing well and had been sober for about six years at that point in time.\n\nSources told PEOPLE that at O’Brien’s holiday party, “Nick was freaking everyone out, acting crazy, kept asking people if they were famous.” According to TMZ, Nick arrived underdressed for the “ritzy” event (he wore a sweatshirt while everyone else wore suits and fancy dresses). Insiders alleged that he was behaving erratically, roaming around the property aimlessly and barely interacting with other guests. According to NBC News, one of those guests was Barry star and Saturday Night Live alum Bill Hader: Nick reportedly interrupted Hader during what Hader told him was a “private conversation,” then stoood still, stared blankly and finally stormed off.\n\nSources alleged that Rob and Michele were embarrassed at Nick’s behavior at the party and that they’d “tried everything” to get their son to be healthy.\n\n“They had had an argument at Conan’s holiday party, and Rob had been telling people that they’re scared for Nick and scared that his mental state was deteriorating,” a source told the New York Post. A friend of the Reiner family claimed that Rob and Michele were urging Nick to get treatment at a facility for a drug relapse, but that he refused.\n\nMarkowitz concurred that the Reiners worked extraordinarily hard to get Nick healthy.\n\n“They gave him everything, they tried a million things with him,” he told Page Six. “Not giving him money but sending him to top-of-the-line places. Rob never gave up. He tried everything. If you knew Rob, he was just a bundle of love.” He added that he and Rob never suspected Nick could be violent with them, explaining, “[Rob] never had fears for his safety. I’m not in his head, but we talked. [Nick] wasn’t a violent type. I slept in the same house as Nick. There was never a thought, I believe, in Rob’s head [that Nick was a danger]. If he would have thought his life was in peril at any point, he would have handled the situation.” He added, “When somebody is mentally disturbed, you don’t need a reason. There’s no rhyme or reason. Mental illness, that’s the reason.”\n\nHowever, a source told The Daily Mail that Nick’s family was “scared” of him because of his alleged “violent outbursts,” and described Nick as “violent and super aggressive.” They claimed that his behavior was often disturbing, but was “magnified to horrific levels” when he was using substances. Sources alleged that Nick was a “ticking time bomb” and prone to “meth-fueled outbursts” that often included destroying property. An insider alleged that Rob and Michele “threatened to call authorities multiple times, but in the end didn’t.”\n\n“If they thought he was violent, things would have been very different,” a source told PEOPLE. “At the worst of it, it hadn’t been like this. I don’t think anyone could have ever seen anything like this coming. Nick was declining lately but he had been really bad before.”\n\nRelated: Who Is Nick Reiner’s Defense Attorney Alan Jackson?\n\nIs Being Charlie about Rob Reiner’s son?\n\nWhen Nick got sober (at least at the time), he and Rob collaborated on the 2015 film Being Charlie. The movie was a semi-autobiographical look at a successful filmmaker eyeing a run for political office (played by Cary Elwes, who also starred in Reiner’s classic The Princess Bride) and his strained relationship with his son Charlie (Nick Robinson), who suffers from addiction.\n\nRob and Nick said that one particular line in the movie, when the father character tells his son, “I’d rather you hate me and be alive,” came directly from their real-life conversations.\n\n“I mean, we did get into fights over things, but ultimately it forced us to make the film better,” Rob Reiner said in 2016. “The whole process for me—I can just speak for myself—it did make me understand him a lot more, and it did make me a better father. Hopefully it did.”\n\nRelated: Watch Rob Reiner and Nick Reiner Talk About Being Charlie a Decade Before the Director’s Murder\n\nHow old is Nick Reiner?\n\nBorn Sept. 14, 1993, Nick Reiner is 32 years old as of this writing.\n\nHas Nick Reiner been arrested?\n\nNick Reiner was arrested without incident at about 9:15 p.m. PT on Sunday, Dec. 14, 2025, hours after his parents were found dead.\n\nRelated: LAPD Releases Photos of Nick Reiner’s Arrest\n\nWhere was Nick Reiner found?\n\nPolice arrested Nick Reiner close to Exposition Park and near the University of Southern California campus, PEOPLE reported. Footage obtained by ABC7 Eyewitness News showed that Nick bought a drink at a gas station moments before police apprehended him. He was wearing a black, green and white striped track jacket, a black cap and blue jeans and was carrying a red backpack at the time.\n\nTMZ reported that Nick had checked into the Pierside Santa Monica hotel, 20 miles from where he was arrested, at about 4 a.m. on Dec. 14, 2025, using his credit card. Spies alleged that Nick was “tweaked out” when he checked in, but that he didn’t have any blood visible on his person. His room after he left, however, was a horrifyingly different story: Police who went to the room to investigate reportedly found blood in the shower and on the bed and bedsheets covering the windows.\n\nSources told TMZ that police told front desk staff at the hotel they were there to do a welfare check on Nick, and ultimately performed a search for the murder weapon on the premises.\n\nTMZ later obtained footage of Nick walking towards the hotel minutes before he checked in (and hours before Rob and Michele Singer Reiner’s bodies were found in their home). In this footage, Nick carries a black backpack, not a red one like he did when he was arrested, so it appears he switched bags at some point after getting to his hotel room and before police apprehended him.\n\nRelated: Rob Reiner’s When Harry Met Sally Confession Goes Viral After His and Wife Michele’s Death\n\nWhat is Nick Reiner charged with?\n\nOn Tuesday, Dec. 16, 2025, Nick Reiner was formally charged with two counts of first-degree murder for the deaths of Michele and Rob Reiner.

These platforms let people wager on everything from elections and award shows to the most trivial internet ephemera, framing bets as tradable “shares” that rise and fall like stocks. With billions in weekly trading volume, massive new funding rounds, and even a CNN partnership with the prediction-betting platform, Kalshi, prediction markets are quickly moving from niche curiosity to mainstream-media fixture—openly touting ambitions to financialize everything.\n\nWarzel is joined by writer Max Read, who argues that prediction markets sit at the intersection of gambling, finance, and a broader “suckerification” economy aimed at young men. Together they unpack whether the markets actually reflect the “wisdom of crowds” or whether they’re little more than a meta-game of vibes, ideology, and misvalued dumb money. The pair explore the culture of these platforms and offer a diagnosis of the attention economy: When it’s hard to sell anything directly, it’s easier to sell derivatives of everything. Prediction markets may promise clarity, Warzel and Read suggest, but what they really offer is another way to feel excitement in a world that feels rigged.\n\nThe following is a transcript of the episode:\n\nMax Read: When I say a “suckerification crisis,” I don’t simply mean, Oh, you know, they’re getting bilked out of their money, though I think that’s part of it. I think there’s a whole kind of both commercial and political kind of apparatus that is working really hard to separate young guys from their money.\n\nCharlie Warzel: I am Charlie Warzel, and this is Galaxy Brain. A few weeks ago on this podcast, the journalist Pablo Torre told me this.\n\nPablo Torre: It feels like, you know, we’re living at a time in which lots of young people were promised things they were not delivered. Perhaps because of the generations that continued to wield power in our government, economy, et cetera, the Boomers—and the way to, like, Chutes and Ladders your way to the American dream is gambling on shit. And in that casino premise, I think you just see again a through line across all these sectors of American life now. Sports being one that has so naturally taken to it. Because, my gosh, here’s an unlimited menu. I mean, literally.\n\nWarzel: Today we’re going to explore another part of that unlimited menu of gambling in the casino-ification of the American economy: prediction markets. Chances are you’ve been hearing a lot about prediction markets lately. At their core, prediction markets are online spaces where people can place wagers on the outcome of events.\n\nThey share similarities with sports books except, unlike a traditional bed at a casino, your wager is a futures contract—the value of which fluctuates based on the market value of the outcome of any given event. Right now, people use the markets to bet on sports, events like the Oscars, whether Elon Musk will tweet a specific number of times in a given month, or about the outcome of an election.\n\nThe top platforms now for prediction markets collectively report several billion dollars’ worth of weekly trading volume. Kalshi, one of the biggest prediction markets in this space, announced this month that it raised a billion dollars from many of Silicon Valley’s biggest venture-capital firms.\n\nRecently, CNN announced it was partnering with Kalshi to integrate the company’s prediction-market data in the news coverage. The company’s CEO, Tarek Mansour, has big ambitions. At a conference in October, he said this about Kalshi’s future:\n\nTarek Mansour: The long-term vision is to financialize everything and create a tradable asset out of any difference in opinion.\n\nWarzel: “Financialize everything.”\n\nThat’s essentially the quiet part out loud. That is the blueprint for the actual casinoification of the world, brought to you by one of the more ascendant companies that’s moving everything toward gambling. So what’s really going on here? How do prediction markets work? Is there some truth to what boosters allege: that people putting their money where their mouths are is actually a good way to tap into the wisdom of crowds?\n\nOr is this just a dystopian development? An example of companies preying on a society with a burgeoning gambling addiction? Today I am joined by Max Read, author of the Great Substack Read Max. Read covers culture and power on the internet and has this really intuitive understanding of platforms and people.\n\nRecently he wrote a great piece titled “Prediction Markets and the Suckerification Crisis.” Max and I talk about where all this is going and why everyone is gambling and no one is happy. Now, my conversation with Max Read.\n\nWarzel: Max Read, welcome to Galaxy Brain.\n\nRead: Thanks for having me, Charlie.\n\nWarzel: Yeah. So we’re going to talk about prediction markets. Hopefully come up with some grand theory as to why they are ascendant and why everything feels a little bit broken. But I want to just first—for the normies out there who aren’t, you know, using them.\n\nHow would you describe them? How are they different from straight-up gambling or a sports book?\n\nRead: Yeah, well, the first time I wrote about them, I described them as sports books that allowed you to place wagers on non-sports events. But I think the extra sort of bit that’s important to understand about them—because at the end of the day, that is what they are, and it’s the way a lot of people use them. And I should note, by the way, that when I say they’re not: They’re sports books that allow you to place bets on non-sporting events. Many of them are actually also sports books. Kalshi in particular allows you to place wagers on games.\n\nBut what they do is really emphasize the wager as a security that you can purchase and sell the way you would a share on the stock market, say. So if you believed, say, that there would be a Democratic sweep across New Jersey, Virginia, and New York City back in November, you could have bought shares. Or you could have bet on that outcome for, you know, what, like 30—like, they’ll do it as prices, right? You bet, you wager 30 cents for the return of a dollar, right? So you could buy the shares at 30 cents. You buy 10 shares at 30 cents; you get $10 back. If that comes off.\n\nNow, I mentioned 30 cents, say, because a couple weeks—I’m not sure if that’s the exact price—but a couple weeks before this election, it was kind of unclear what Democrats’ chances were going to be in any of these elections. There’s a lot of polls coming out saying that Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey was running dangerously sort of close in the race against … I can’t even remember the name of her opponent at this point.\n\nBut, you know, it was a fairly low probability according to the betters on the app. Right? But as the returns start to come in on Tuesday night—and it becomes clear that actually the chances that this is going to be a sweep across all these elections get higher—all of a sudden the price of a given wager rises. Or the price of a given share, so to speak.\n\nSo at 30 cents—suddenly it’s 40 cents, suddenly it’s 60 cents. The way you would think about that if you were just talking gambling odds is, all of a sudden, you’re getting less return on your wager, basically. Your odds are getting significantly easier.\n\nAnd, you could have, say—let me give a slightly different example of election. So recently in Tennessee, this woman, Aftyn Behn, was running for a congressional seat. And, she was absolutely not the favorite. It was a “Trump plus 30” congressional district or whatever, and you could buy shares for her victory at like, you know, 20 cents, something like that, the week before the election. The night of the election, as returns start coming in, she’s looking actually kind of good for it. The early returns are quite good for her. And I watched as the price of her shares climbed up. I’m not going to say whether or not I had any horse in this race, any money on this. But I was watching it closely, let’s just say.\n\nAnd there was a point where if you had bought shares at 30—and again, who knows who I’m talking about here—but if you had bought shares at 30, you could have sold them for a 100 percent profit. Sold them at 60 cents. Only for those shares to come crashing down as the results continue coming over the night, and it becomes clear it’s not happening.\n\nSo—sorry, this is a sort of complicated explanation—but I think it’s useful to understand how you use it. Right? That when you go on these sites, what you’re doing is: You’re doing this kind of thing that’s kind of a hybrid. Like stock-market day-trading activity and a betting activity. And I do think it’s worth saying, as much as they emphasize the sort of security, quality of these wagers.\n\nYou can do this at a sports book too, right? That odds will change at a sports book depending on who’s taking which side of the bet, and you can cash out. Most sports books will allow you to cash out various times, you know, after you’ve placed your wager. And if the odds of the wager have changed in between the period where you placed your wager and you’re cashing out, you could make a small profit just from cashing out, right?\n\nIf you wager a team is going to win, and then you could cash out with five minutes to go and they’re up by 20 points, you’re not going to get as much as you would if you saw the whole thing out. But you can cash out at a fairly high profit. So in that sense, you know, it’s sort of another way of looking at, or another way of thinking about, gambling that emphasizes the sort of up-and-down nature of odds. And I think that’s how most people kind of approach it when they’re on the site placing these wagers—they’re thinking about it like betting. But I think it’s also important to understand why [these sites] have become so ubiquitous in media is that they are exciting to a lot of economists and libertarians. especially libertarian economists. It’s that they offer a kind of semi-accurate—accurate depending on the liquidity of the market, accurate depending on the size of the market—accurate picture of what you might think of as the conventional wisdom. Right? Because there’s all these people collectively saying how much [they’re] placing their own odds, so to speak, on a given outcome.\n\nWagering their own actual money, so they have skin in the game. So nobody’s doing this just for propaganda purposes, or whatever. You can say, Conventional wisdom has the chances of this event happening at 50 percent, 30 percent, whatever. Now, these markets are still fairly small, and many of them are not very liquid at all.\n\nSo it is not like there’s millions of people betting a couple bucks at a time to make them, you know, as sort of accurate as possible. You’ll have a couple whales who are placing large wagers, which makes them interesting in what they tell you. Because it’s not saying, necessarily, the conventional wisdom according to the kind of person who places a bet on this kind of a thing.\n\nBut that’s the other side of it. The nonuser side, the media side, the philosophical side of this is: Prediction markets allow us to start to look at the future in this way that allows us to set probabilities about things.\n\nWarzel: I’m curious what you make of the “wisdom of crowds” bit, because this is the part of me that stops and feels a little insane sometimes with this. Because I think about, like, this is essentially a meta-game, right? Where you have this system that produces outcomes and incentives for certain outcomes that arise in it, and you wrap that system in an apparatus that is also concerned with influencing those outcomes.\n\nIt’s this second-order thing like you have with poker—where good poker players can technically predict the outcome of hands, but that is also influencing the outcomes of the games. It just feels to me like what you’re doing is: Prediction markets aren’t what people think will happen. It’s what people think other people think will happen, right? So it feels to me it’s confusing.\n\nRead: I do think there’s a use for that. You could come up with reasons. And from a financial sort of market perspective, one way of thinking about it is that these are effectively tools. Instruments for hedging, right?\n\nThat you have a sense of—you think something’s going to happen, but you also want to place some wagers on the side in case it doesn’t happen to limit your losses. And for that, you don’t need it to be wholly accurate, right? You just need it to sort of approximate a given outcome that allows you to make money off of that.\n\nI think there’s sort of two ways to go with what you’re saying. One is that, until recently, prediction markets have largely been a sort of theoretical idea, right? I mean, we could talk about the stock market—or a sports book, for that matter—as a prediction market. But this sort of all-encompassing marketplace to make wagers on.\n\nI mean, recently there were wagers on the Time magazine “Person of the Year” cover, all the Oscars, all the award-season stuff. You can wager on who’s going to get nominated and who’s going to win. We’ve talked about elections already. There’s even, often, marketplaces for words getting mentioned by prominent figures in—what’s the word I’m looking for—in speeches or in, you know, earnings calls. If you believe really strongly in the idea of the wisdom of crowds, it’s very exciting.\n\nBut the theoretical model of the prediction market is, as I was sort of emphasizing before, is one that everybody is participating in. The market is fully liquid. Everybody has a stake in it. Everybody is placing wagers there. And these markets are fairly far from that, right? On Election Night, there tends to be enough money, and enough people, to sort of approximate what we’ve been talking about as the conventional wisdom about who’s going to win and who’s going to lose.\n\nBut that’s not always the case, and certainly not the case for stuff like these culture categories that I’m talking about. I wanted to ask—without you having to divulge whether you are, or are not, actively participating in these markets—what’s the culture like on these? I think it mirrors some of the culture on X/Twitter in the Musk era.\n\nBut when you go either to try to place some wagers, or for reporting purposes,what’s the culture like?\n\nRead: So, I can talk about the culture in the comment sections—which I wouldn’t want to suggest is wholly reflective of the culture of these places in general.\n\nAnd I think there is a wide range. There is smart money. There are sharks out there who are running programs and bots to identify. Especially on an election night, you’ll get guys who are pulling results all doing this automated, basically HFD—like high-frequency traders pulling results from The New York Times or Decision Desk or whoever. And, like, immediately placing orders on shares to take advantage of that. Like, you don’t have to do it in the milliseconds the way you do on Wall Street, but you can do it if you just do it in a couple seconds. We’ll still make it advantageous.\n\nAnd you have people who are quite good—for example, the Time magazine cover leaked before it was announced. And a bunch of people made a tidy little profit, because it took a while for the market to catch up. So I say that just to say that there are smart people. Just as a to be sure thing before I get into the comments—which are really stupid. I mean, there’s just a lot of stupid people there. And there’s a funny mix of just really obviously stupid people—you know, Free Republic–commenter type, X, like bottom-of-the-barrel, Trumpist X types. And then there’s stupid, just guys who have sort of wandered in. Every wager, if you scroll far enough, you’ll find a guy who took the stupid side of the wager because he didn’t read the terms until after he’d put his $50 down.\n\nHe is like, Oh, I didn’t realize that I was actually betting, you know, against this. I thought I was betting for it. Oh, well, now I’m out 50 bucks. The tone reminds me a lot of—I think the closest thing I can think of online, or the two closest things, are the: If you play fantasy football in Yahoo, every player has their own little comment section. And you can pull it up as you’re deciding who’s to start and who to bench.\n\nAnd it’s just filled with people just clinging to the most desperate of threads. You know, citing articles they read somewhere. Nobody’s linking to anything. Everyone’s like, Oh, I heard he is going to play. Oh, I heard he is injured. Oh, I heard he’s, you know, he’s not going to be the first QB.\n\nHe’s not going to get any catches. He is not going to get any throws this game. Whatever it is. And the comments on the bets kind of remind me of this on all the markets. It’s somebody being like, Oh, you know, there’s one market that’s which member of Trump’s Cabinet is going to leave first.\n\nAnd everyone’s like, Well, okay, well here’s this thing I read about [Pete] Hegseth. And somebody else will be like, Well, I read this about Pam Bondi. And people doing their theories. It’s a message board. It’s not the dumbest place I’ve ever read, but it’s of a basic kind of politics message-board stupidity.\n\nIt’s just that there’s all this money going on in the background. All of which is to say, when I say it’s similar to the fantasy-football chats is: It’s very male. Obviously it’s very young. Obviously, I mean—I think most of the guys are sort of in their 20s. It’s sort of confident, but Ill-informed in the way you would expect a lot of guys who to gamble in their 20s basically are.\n\nWarzel: There’s also—and I don’t mean this in a pearl-clutching way—but it’s a little reactionary. Right? Because part of what I see in the elevator pitch from some of the founders of this—it’s trying to court people who have some skepticism about the way that institutions behave, right? Kalshi’s co-founder, Tarek Mansour, I think is how you say his name. He’s really positioned this as the “wisdom of crowds,” because regular institutions have failed us, right? Because there’s this plethora of information out there, because reporters aren’t actually very good at telling, or getting, the story the way it is—come here. Not only is this a helpful tool, but that seems to recruit, just generally, people who a little bit more edgelord-y, or whatever. Yeah. Is that accurate to you?\n\nRead: I think so. I mean, I think—certainly, not to sort of underline this point—but I do think it’s worth thinking about the prediction markets in two phases.\n\nThere’s, especially, the ones around politics. There’s the long phase before the election, whatever election is being bet on, happens. Which, I think, there is a—I don’t want to put a number on it, but I think that the markets tend to lean right? They just tend to overestimate Republicans. They tend to—not by a significant amount, not by the amount that you can make a ton of money off of unless you’re gambling a lot—but generally they tend to give Republicans better odds and Democrats worse odds. That’s phase one. And then, phase two is closer to the actual election. And that’s, in my experience, at least, when the smart money starts to roll in. And people come through just to pick up—basically, they take the transition from “the market’s tilting Republican” to reality setting in, and they make a quick profit off of that.\n\nAnd then, by the end of the night, we know who won, and the markets are settled. They’re mostly settled. So I think that: Yes, the culture, in that sense, tilts right. I think that there’s also sort of two aspects to why that is. The first is exactly as you’re saying: that there is a deep and longstanding philosophical affinity between predictions markets, the wisdom of crowds, so to speak.\n\nThe idea that markets, in general, can calculate things better than institutions or humans can. That dates back to [Friedrich] Hayek and [Ludwig von] Mises. And this is sort of foundational to, you might say, neoliberalism in some broad sense. But also to a lot of the way that Silicon Valley has thought about the world since the ’90s.\n\nRight. You know, there’s this idea that we don’t want top-down people in charge. We want this sort of collective, anarchic mass of humanity working together. And a market or a quasi-market format will pull these together. So I think there is this kind of highfalutin, let’s say, philosophical background here that probably pushes the prediction markets—the people who use them and certainly the people who build them—to the right. To the kind of libertarian, hard-libertarian, market-worshiping right. But there also is a particular sort of base, reactionary nest to a lot of what goes on there, that I think is more tied in with—to some extent takes its cues from—the sort of intellectual draws that I’ve just been talking about. But is more tied into one being young and male. And gambling—young men like to gamble; young men tend to be more right wing.\n\nSo I think that’s just sort of a basic demographic and sociological fact of 2025. They’re also pulling in a lot of people from X, which is just significantly more right wing than it was five years ago. And, as I was saying, they also are—without wanting to be too smug about it—they’re trying to pull in, through their marketing campaigns, pull in a lot of dumb money. To make it attractive for smart money to come in.\n\nAnd they do that by advertising to the biases of the reactionaries on X, basically. So, I decided to write about this because, around the time of the November elections when Zohran Mamdani was running high in New York City, but as is often the case, there’s a lot of people in New York who hated him. Who were sort of, Well, I don’t think he’s going to win.\n\nYou know, I think people there [were], as you were saying, The mainstream media is ignoring all my neighbors that hate him. All my neighbors are going to vote against him. And Kalshi started running. And Polymarket, too, started running all of these. They own these, um. They run these sort of newswire accounts, that are depending on both the official accounts. But also they have their own news accounts that they don’t link to the betting sites, really. They just do these blanket, one-line, almost like a Bloomberg-terminal news thing that tends to be very misleading. Very right wing.\n\nYou know, in one case Kalshi tweeted—sometimes they’ll tweet about the prediction markets. And they’ll be like, Zohran Mamdani’s position is tumbling. And that kind of thing is obviously going to bring in … you know, you could do that with liberals. I don’t wanna pretend that liberals in America are so much better at picking out misinformation and scams and whatever else. But it’s very clear who they want to appeal to on Twitter. And it’s low-social-trust gamblers, basically.\n\nWarzel: Yeah. And also, just even beyond the political part of it. Some of these accounts that are run by these prediction markets—like Kalshi, Polymarket—are just trolling, right? There’s this one image of 49ers running back Christian McCaffrey with the caption “Loves receiving balls,” right?\n\nAnd it was just this big sort of trade, or “on the disabled list”–style, graphic. But again, as you said, they don’t link to it. But it’s almost just kind of like, We’re having fun on here, too. Why don’t you come have fun on our place, and, you know, take advantage of this?\n\nBut, you talk about this dumb money. And you described it, in this great Substack post that we’ll link to, as the part of the male “suckerification crisis.” And can you elaborate a little more on that? I think that’s sort of your corollary to the male loneliness crisis they’re in. But what are you saying here?\n\nRead: I feel like one of the big stories on the internet—and in society at large—over the last five years or so has been the extent to which young men have fallen under the spell, or the sway, of a variety of different kinds of scammers, hucksters, fraudsters. When I say a “suckerification crisis,” I don’t simply mean, Oh, you know, they’re getting bilked out of their money. Though I think that’s part of it. I think there’s a whole kind of—both commercial and political—apparatus that is working really hard to separate young guys from their money.\n\nAnd I think that there’s something about, I don’t have a grand … you know, this is more of a corkboard-and-red-yarn theory than an equation, right? Warzel: We love that. Read: But I see these connections. I see these sort of basic dynamics play out in straight old-fashioned sports gambling, which has sort of taken over sports media. That was legalized a few years ago and now kind of dominates the way we talk about sports in the country. At least, in the media that has written about sports and filmed about sports. I see it in prediction markets as well. Talking about this, sort of, Kalshi and Polymarket Twitter feeds that we’re talking about. You know, the sense that This is gambling kind of creeping into even more layers of life, layers of social life.\n\nI see it in the kind of manosphere-influencer guys. These sort of perennial subjects, objects of moral panic. But, you know—the main sort of dynamic I see there is not necessarily even kind of ideological, radicalization on the part of somebody like Andrew Tate. But the way that they are selling a particular story and a particular product to a bunch of young men that kind of cultivates them as suckers, that turns them into suckers.\n\nAnd I think that Trumpist politics—by which I mean both the Republican Party under Donald Trump, but also all kinds of right-wing, reactionary politics—emerge out of the same sort of soup. You know. This highly emotive insistence that—as you sort of put it earlier—Institutions are failing you, but we’ve got the cure. We’ve got the ticket; you can participate in this movement. You can show everybody that you’re smarter than everybody else. Here’s the secret to making money. Here’s the secret to, you know, winning in politics. Here’s the secret to getting girls. Whatever it is. It’s funny to me how much you can sort of see that same dynamic across what should, theoretically, be these quite different kinds of spheres. But seem to, in fact, kind of be converging on this one sort of business model, more or less.\n\nYou know, just to provide some historical perspective—Rick Perlstein, the historian, has a really wonderful essay in The Baffler from maybe 10 or more years ago that I think about all the time in terms of this. I think it’s called “The Long Con.” And it’s about the origins of the conservative movement in the 1950s and the extent to which the conservative movement has always been deeply tangled up with, basically, snake-oil mailing lists.\n\nThat a huge part of what powers the conservative movement is access to mailing lists of low social trust. Reactionary voters who are willing to buy what you’re selling if you speak the right language, more or less. And, as I was saying before, I think Twitter feels sort of like a really sophisticated version of that.\n\nAnd I think that this whole complex of businesses are finding new ways to sort of exploit that particular dynamic. And, to some extent, I think this is a sort of layered process, right? That you go on Twitter—it’s a social media site. It’s, you know, highly volatile. You’re constantly feeling like everybody else is getting more views than you.\n\nYou’re constantly sort of feeling you’re in this strange space that you don’t necessarily understand. You know, you’re surrounded by people who are expressing that same strange feeling. It feels a lot like being in the economy, too, doesn’t it? And isn’t politics also this strange, volatile space?\n\nSurely there’s a way we can all make a little extra money off of it. We’re constantly in competition. It’s not a hard-and-fast theory. It’s this set of affective triggers, right? These sort of—this vibe that’s out there that seems to be quite inescapable. In particular for, you know, recent college graduates. Kids in college, even in high school,\n\nWarzel: Right. And there’s this way that it’s this reinforcing system, right? If you do fall into those, into that mindset, you enter into a place that sort of embraces the chaos, embraces the precarity therein, right? And then feeling all that gives you. The only possible way out, right?\n\nThe only possible latch onto a kind of, you know, new version of the American Dream. Which is just like, I buy this memecoin low, I sell high. Right? I get in this place here, and it’s—but that usually doesn’t work out well for most people, right? A lot of the dumb money. And then you get back in this cycle of precarity resentment.\n\nOkay, now we have the antidote to that. And the cycle just repeats over and over again.\n\nRead: One thing I would add, that I didn’t really write about in this piece—but that has been something on my mind for a long time, because I feel it too—is a sort of increasing sense in American society that everybody else is getting one over on you and/or the system.\n\nAnd that in fact, if you let everybody else get one over on you, you are weak, and you have made a mistake. You know, you are a sucker. When, in fact, I think in many ways it’s sort of the reverse. That it’s like, if you’re constantly trying—if you’re the one who’s constantly trying to get one over—you probably are a sucker yourself.\n\nAnd, you know, I think there’s—I mean, the root cause here, I would say, is sort of society-wide breakdown of trust in institutions. You know, in the sense that institutions are in it for themselves, and they are, you know, corrupt. And giving handouts to their people and not to you.\n\nAgain, this is also this sort of vibe that seeps out and powers a lot of the kind of activity around predictions markets. But also around a bunch of these other businesses and figures.\n\nWarzel: I wanna test out a theory on all this that’s maybe another side of it. Or maybe it’s just this in a different skin, but which is, very broadly, this idea that it’s exceedingly hard in a mature attention economy to sell something, right?\n\nAnd it is because of all the competition for attention. And it’s much easier to sell a derivative of that thing. I read this post a couple weeks ago that was talking about movie marketing, and how it’s kind of just gone haywire. And this idea that stars are doing things that aren’t like a traditional junket, where they’re talking about the film with a hundred different people. But they’re going on a hundred different podcasts or, you know, video shows or whatever.\n\nAnd basically doing viral skits, right? You can kind of start at Hot Ones. But then you can trace this to Jennifer Lawrence and her co-star Robert Pattinson doing lie-detector tests, right? A lot of celebrities doing lie-detector tests for Vanity Fair or whatever. And it’s good content. People watch it. People are interested in it. It’s good for the timeline. But it historically is not selling these movies, right? Because they’re not talking about the film. They’re talking about themselves in the hope that they’re going to garner enough attention to sell a film.\n\nRight? And, I think of that idea of a derivative of something. I think about it, very obviously, with sports gambling, right? Leagues are interested in having this, because it does draw attention to the games, right? Adam Silver, the NBA’s commissioner, wrote this op-ed 10 years ago or so, kind of advocating to legalize sports gambling.\n\nAnd there’s this idea that it will draw in interest and attention to this event. But it’s interest and attention essentially to, you know, a game within a game. Right? People are interested in hitting the over; they’re interested in, you know, how many free throws so-and-so gets. Or, you know, misses. Or whatever, right?\n\nAnd I’m curious if you feel this too? That—we see it with elections, right? It doesn’t matter so much about the outcome as much as it is getting the edge. And this idea of financialization of everything. Just creating derivatives of everything to the point where it’s almost impossible to sell a thing.\n\nRead: Yeah. I mean, I think that this is part of the attraction of the prediction market over the regular sports book, too. I guess it’s not just derivatives; it’s securitization. And that you create this object that you can sell and resell at whatever.\n\nYou know, I don’t want to drive the metaphor off a cliff or whatever. But one of the interesting things about those viral videos of, say, Pattinson and Jennifer Lawrence doing the lie-detector test, as you say—probably not very useful for marketing the movie. But that video is now useful to Vanity Fair, or whoever it was that filmed it. And will be useful to them for 10 years, because those are going to be famous people that people will wanna see for 10 years.\n\nLord knows, there’s no time limit for anything on the internet. You now have this thing that just kind of exists in the world. And I think that there’s a real difficulty to find ways to have those derivatives, to maintain their relationship to the bigger project that’s supposed to be pushing forward. The other thing, I would say, that sports thing—what you were saying about sports makes me think is that part of this is about media in general. Right? That we’re increasingly difficult to figure out how to pay for the media that exists, and that we think of presumably as sort of integral to democracy. To our liberal democratic system. And sports arguably runs a little bit ahead of political media, news media, in terms of business models and whatever else. And one of the big reasons that Adam Silver has been an advocate for legalizing gambling—and one of the reasons why all of the media companies, ESPN chief among them, have so enthusiastically embraced sports betting—is that we sort of have reached peak sports.\n\nWe’re a little bit over the hill in peak sports. Basketball is a very good example, because—you know, Mark Cuban was talking about this just last year—nobody thinks the next few TV deals are going to be anywhere near as lucrative as the last few TV deals are. Where the question is: Who is making money and how are they making money?\n\nAnd that’s not just the question for the team owners, who will always make money from the stadium, right? And from the actual games themselves. But how is ESPN going to make money? And the answer, right now, seems to be gambling. We’re going to take gambling sponsorships; we’re going to talk about gambling all the time.\n\nSo when we talk about, like Kalshi and Polymarket. You know, why is CNN so enthusiastic about bringing them on? I mean, they already are, in fact, partnering with Kalshi to, I think—or maybe with Polymarket—to produce odds for them on Election Night. And presumably elsewhere during the political season.\n\nAnd so I think there’s the other part of it, in addition to the kind of structural. The way we think about marketing and attention is to break things off into these little pieces that can be bought and sold. In the last 10 years, it’s that we are facing a crisis for how we pay for these things. And gambling is a traditionally fairly lucrative industry to be in. And, you know, that’s a way that CNN could take itself.\n\nWarzel: You don’t want Cousin Sal to moderate Meet the Press going forward. I feel like that’s a great idea. The partnership is between Kalshi and CNN, and I think that, you’re absolutely right about the “paying for it” part of it. Which is obviously the most important part.\n\nI also think that there is this attentional quality that injects a little bit of—I’m trying to think about this. You know, it feels so dystopian having CNN’s Harry Enten, the polling guy, is going to be the one who’s going to be doing the big board and looking through the Kalshi odds, what they’ve said.\n\nAnd it feels a little dystopian to have that partnership. But also, it injects, I think—for them trying to rationalize it in some way—some excitement into something. That, when you said we’ve reached peak sports a while back, we’ve reached peak politics too.\n\nWe are well beyond peak politics, where everyone is just sort of ground down by, you know, how this works. But also kind of strangely, terminally addicted to it at the same time. You can’t quit it, but there’s nothing in it. And this is sort of—whatever derivative, a securitization. It’s some element that I think also injects … people joke about horse-race coverage. And it’s like, no: We’re actually making a horse race now.\n\nRead: The problem with horse-race coverage was that we didn’t have the horse race yet.\n\nWarzel: Our mutual friend and fellow tech writer John Herrman wrote a thing for the Neiman Lab’s year-end predictions here for 2026—that the media will become addicted to gambling, follow the path of sports media.\n\nIt’s very smart. Do you feel like this is just going to get worse? Where do you see this all moving? Is it just increasingly lawless, like we’re just going to, you know, fall victim to all this? Do you think this is a kind of a fad? Do you think this is maybe something that actually is the injection of capital that these places need? How do you sort of project it going forward?\n\nRead: I am not necessarily as pessimistic. I think that the forces are arrayed in favor of the prediction market becoming a sort of dominant means by which we interpret and understand the world around us.\n\nThere’s a lot of money behind that—and there’s a lot of powerful philosophical and political ideas that want to see something like this, you know, take a larger role in society. And the truth is, in addition to … I don’t even mean to make it sound that sinister. Like, from a banker’s point of view, a stock trader’s point of view, having all these extra hedging instruments is useful. From the point of view of CNN on Election Night, setting aside this sort of question of how much gambling is going to dominate CNN, the prediction markets give us something to talk about that is not that different in terms of its relationship to reality—from polls, say.\n\nSo all this stuff is the money, the philosophy, the use. All that stuff is lined up in a way that gives prediction markets, I think, a big sort of runway to find themselves. To become more and more prominent. And to intermediate more areas of life. That being said, we’ve seen, since 2022—when, I think, sports gambling was legalized in New York—we’ve seen how much sports gambling has taken over sports media. How much sports betting has sort of become this ubiquitous thing in coverage. But my impression—and I think this bears out in most of the polling that’s been done recently—so people actually hate this. Even the young men who are supposed to be the customers don’t really like it very much.\n\nAnd I think that same quality is going to be true of prediction markets. I think there’s a very particular—this is just baseless theorization right here; this is my own version of astrology—but I think there’s a certain kind of person whose brain works in this particular, let’s say Bayesian way. Where they are constantly thinking about things in terms of odds. Where they are calculating in their own heads, you know, arbitrage opportunities and what kinds of bets they’re willing to, you know. They’re doing Kelly criterion bets and whatever calculations in their heads.\n\nAnd I think for those people, these things are incredibly exciting. I think those people are also really heavily concentrated in Silicon Valley and Wall Street, basically. Those are the places you go if that’s the kind of brain you have. I think a lot of the rest of us find it … I mean, I could speak for myself alone, but I know I’m not alone. That kind of way of being in the world—way of thinking about the world—is exhausting. You’re not really thinking about the game. You’re thinking about the over; you’re thinking about the props that you’ve put together.\n\nYou’re thinking about the parlay across the three different games. I think that prediction markets being inserted everywhere else has a very similar kind of quality to it. I wonder if there’s a happy medium? I think with sports betting, what many people sort of now these days believe is that there should not be apps for it.\n\nIt shouldn’t really be legal. There should be a guy that if you have the social wherewithal to find, you can place a bet with, right? But it shouldn’t be the kind of thing where they just roll out the red carpet, and there’s a lubricated path to losing all of your money.\n\nAnd I’m pretty sympathetic to that. I don’t know if that makes me an old man.\n\nWarzel: I think what you’re saying is: Friction is a good thing, right? Friction is helpful here. And a lot of these betting apps … I actually can’t speak to Kalshi or Polymarket, but like the the DraftKings, FanDuel—they’re literally sending push notifications. Of like, This is about to happen. You know, whatever it is.\n\nIt’s not even neutral, in the sense that it’s easily accessible. It’s like the bookie is sitting on your couch, you know? Asking you if you’d like to get in on this. Right? So you have that element; you have the idea that gambling itself in all things—whether it’s on elections, whether it’s on whatever—gambling is not a static thing, right? Every different type. There’s so many different types of gambling, of ways to bet, that can give you slightly better odds. Or that are, you know, based off of skill instead of blind luck. And the idea that the closer you get to the slot machine, right? Just pull and, you know, a couple of things have to line up—that’s the worst part of gambling. And that’s what we are moving toward; this tech-enabled stuff tends to resemble that more than it resembles, you know, betting on who’s going to win in a golf match, with your friends or whatever. And then I think you’re right about the exhaustion of it all.\n\nAnd it reminds me of the nature of these companies, right? This focus and need on scaling. A lot of these companies—like Kalshi just raised a billion dollars earlier in December from some of the major tech venture capitalists. They’re obviously going to need to scale. Their CEO said now, infamously, the goal is to financialize every single difference of opinion in the world. Which, as you put, is patently the most exhausting thing you could imagine.\n\nNo disagreement goes unmonetized is like—just end it all now. I think, unlike you, I do feel it’s a little sinister. Listening to you talk about the relationship of the risk, the volatility, you know, the gambling, the sort of reactionary poking and prodding and trolling on X to get you in the funnel, to put you into this precarious situation.\n\nAll of that, to me, actually feels it is bad. And that feels dominant to me, over “This is a really great way to get a bird’s-eye view of a situation.”\n\nRead: I probably am being too kind. I do think it is sinister. And I think that it’s bad in an absolute sense. But I am, also—I feel like it’s good to be conscious of the uses that it has. And the kinds of forces that are arrayed in its favor. And that it’s not a cash grab, and it’s not a kind of, necessarily, a pure philosophical dispute—that there are serious institutions for whom this represents a windfall or a new method of doing what they do.\n\nI wonder a little bit. Let me preface this by saying this, as a sort of depressing thought that I’m not necessarily endorsing. But, you know, one reason I think that sports gambling has taken off so wildly—and one reason I think even stuff like fantasy football, which is in some ways quite similar to gambling, but obviously also very different in important ways—is the extent to which sports as a pastime, or as an entertainment, represent a kind of … I’ll take baseball for an example.\n\nSay that baseball is kind of a solved game. You have a pretty good sense at the very beginning of the season. You know people are very good at projecting who’s going to win, how many wins there’re going to be. What you’re waiting for is injuries. And then, the playoffs.\n\nIt’s not luck, but it’s basically luck. I say that, you know—it’s probably the greatest World Series of my lifetime, this past year. But one thing that I think that gambling allows us to do in in a world—in, like, the NBA, when a third of regular-season games, most of the stars just flat out aren’t playing. Which I know that the NBA hates, but is also exactly what you need to do, because that’s a problem that has now been solved by resting people.\n\nWhat you find yourself wanting to get: the sense of volatility—the sense of unexpected delight and whatever else gambling becomes—the way you get out of sports. That what feels harder and harder to get as more and more money gets applied to, like, figuring out the secrets to winning each one of these.\n\nAnd I’m not sure what the way to apply that is as a metaphor to the rest of the world out there. But I think that part of what the attraction here, too, is taking things that have been optimized to hell. Like, whatever it is. The things that no longer give you the same kind of burst of enjoyment because you know what to expect from them, at all times.\n\nAnd the gambling—you know, the prediction market, the gambling, the wagers. They give you that little extra burst of dopamine, energy, enjoyment, excitement. Because all of a sudden you’re attaching some money to something that isn’t the necessarily even the main point of the game. And I think, to me, that’s depressing. Because I’m sympathetic to it. Right. Though I’m sympathetic to that desire to try and find the same kind of enjoyment. But also because that’s the thing that, I think, hooks people—more than the sort of sense that, Oh, I can find the edge by doing my calculations in my head. And every dispute is going to be financialized, and we’re going to figure that out.\n\nIt’s more like: I just wanna take a little risk somewhere. Like, a fairly safe risk. Just to give myself … just to feel something, somewhere. Just to feel something.\n\nWarzel: The thing that makes me think about with sports—especially in baseball, where we’re about to go into, a year from now, these major labor disputes with the unions—is this inequality, right? There is this fundamental inequality in baseball between the haves and the have-nots. And the big-market teams and the Cincinnati Reds. Or like, you know, what have you. And in that, you do have that situation often in a fanbase of Okay, well, if we make the playoffs, we’re going to get, you know, absolutely destroyed in the first round. And that’s a good year. And “enjoy the ride,” right? But it’s getting something else there. And then when I try to think—does that apply broadly out to politics?\n\nOf course, maybe not exactly, right? It’s not a total inequality thing. But it is this sort of feeling like the system isn’t going to move, right? Like it’s sclerotic in this way. Like you’re not going to get a candidate that’s just going to come out of nowhere, unless you have, you know, these instances like Mamdani.\n\nRead: I mean, look at how much energy, I mean, even Kamala Harris’s emergence—in 18 hours as the Democratic nominee, after [Joe] Biden [dropped out], had that burst of energy. Because it was such an unexpected historical event. Even if she was, you know, not the most exciting candidate to young people in the world, or whatever. She was a sort of—exactly who you would’ve “expect the unexpectedness” about. It gave that extra bit of energy.\n\nWarzel: I think that that is such a good way to frame all of this in a world that’s feeling a little bit locked, right? Where everything seems a little locked, this is injecting a kind of chaos that allows people to feel.\n\nRead: I think that’s real. Well, the other thing—and I would say two things on top of that. One is: I think—just to reconnect some of the stuff we were talking about before—I think it is relatively similar to some of the appeal of social networks, which have a volatility to them. And I think that one of the reasons that Twitter is less—and Facebook too, are less and less, and Instagram even—become less and less interesting to people is probably because they become sort of solved games. And, you know, what does well in the algorithm. What does well. It’s much harder to have that pop of the thing that you get really early on a social network—always like, I’ve never seen something like this before. This is so weird. This kind of person, you could still sort of find it there. But those that like volatility, it’s there in a certain limited way. But not in the same way. The other thing, I would say, is that this feeling we’re talking about—I think what’s at stake is a sense that there’s very little to surprise us anymore.\n\nAnd this is, again, a sort of a vibe more than it is a fact. But there is this vibe of, like, Everything’s optimized to hell. Everybody, for the most part, acts really cautious in their given settings, the domains in which they’re playing. It’s hard to find surprise. Gambling at least gives us some level of, you know—allows us to feel something, as we put it.\n\nBut what prediction markets effectively do, over the long term, is even eliminate that from gambling. Because what you’re doing—once the market is big enough, once enough people are betting—all of a sudden all the surprises are kind of gone. Except for weather events, right?\n\nIt’s the last thing that you could bet on: where there’s some possibly there won’t be rain, despite the 90 percent–chance forecast the next day. And I think it’s self-defeating. I suppose. I don’t like … that’s a science-fiction story more than it is something that we really have to worry about at this point.\n\nBut I think that ultimately the point of the prediction market is to reassert the primacy of locked-in predictions. Even if what makes it interesting right now is the enjoyment of risk and novelty and surprise.\n\nWarzel: I love the idea that eventually the prediction market, it eats its own young at the end of it. I think that’s a great place to leave it. Max Read, thank you so much for coming on Galaxy Brain.\n\nRead: It was absolutely my pleasure.

Their Decision on Releasing Their 2024 Autopsy Report Says It All","text":"As we reported, new polling brought some bad news for congressional Democrats. \n\nThey hit their lowest rating ever, with only 18 percent approval, 73 percent disapproval in a new Quinnipiac poll.\n\nAs CNN data guru Harry Enten explained, they were \"-55 net approval, an all-time low & lower than the Dead Sea.\" \n\nWhat was worse for them was that even amongst their own party, they were underwater, with only 42 percent approving and 48 percent disapproving. Their party approval had taken a nosedive since October, after they failed in the government shutdown fight. \n\nDespite that, they were ahead on the generic ballot by about four points. But as Enten noted, this should be much higher normally for the midterms, where the party out of power usually has the advantage. It showed how weak they were. \n\nREAD MORE: Make It Make Sense: Dem Approval Rating Falls Off a Cliff, but Voters Have Baffling Reaction\n\nNow, on Friday, two new polls, Emerson and Quantus Insights, show Democrats only up by two points in the generic ballot, which is even better than the numbers Enten had mentioned. Quantus has it at 43 to 41 percent, and Emerson has it at 44 to 42 percent. \n\nThen, on top of that, the DNC's Ken Martin announced that they wouldn't be releasing the autopsy report on why they lost in 2024. \n\nKen Martin, the chairman of the D.N.C., said on Thursday that he had decided not to publish a report that he ordered months ago into what went wrong for the Democratic Party last year. Party officials have conducted more than 300 interviews with Democrats in all 50 states to create a document that Mr. Martin had once pitched as crucial to charting a path forward. Mr. Martin will instead keep the findings under seal. He believes that looking back so publicly and painfully at the past would prove counterproductive for the party as it tries next year to take back power in Congress, according to a D.N.C. spokeswoman who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share the thinking behind his decision. “Here’s our North Star: Does this help us win?” Mr. Martin said in a statement. “If the answer is no, it’s a distraction from the core mission.”\n\nTranslation? The report shows how bad their issues are; it will hurt and embarrass them. So, like typical Democrats, they just wasted all that time and money because they don't like the reality of what they were told. \n\nThey haven't answered the question, for example, of how Kamala Harris' team threw $1.5 billion down the sewer and didn't even manage to win one swing state. \n\nSimon Bazelon, a Democratic researcher, noted how this decision doesn't help them solve their issues and was \"reflective of a broader problem within the party.\" You can say that again. This is \"hide your head in the sand\" behavior. \n\nThey appear to want to return to their strategy of 2024, just yelling about President Donald Trump. \n\nRepublicans have a real chance here; they need to focus on the economy. They need to remind everyone what a mess things were under the Democrats, going up to 9 percent on inflation, and what they are doing to make things better, as Trump did during his economic address on Wednesday. \n\nREAD MORE: Trump White House Address Touts Administration's Domestic Wins, Announces Christmas Bonus for Troops\n\nThursday's inflation number was good, at 2.7 percent. Gas is down, wages are up, and more good things are on the horizon.

Why are Republicans rebutting those charges in much the same way Democrats did?\n\nHypocrisy and double standards in political discourse are not new, but they blur the lines that supposedly fuel our political blood feuds and boost voter cynicism about a rigged game. Those sentiments need no further help to blossom.\n\nThere’s a long list of issues that Democrats didn’t have much to say about up to Jan. 19, Joe Biden’s last full day as president, but have portrayed as four-alarm fires under Donald Trump. Three have dominated: inflation, the president’s health and energy for the job, and hunting down anyone who ever spent time with Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nTrump’s hands aren’t clean, either. He has downplayed Americans’ concerns about rising prices, hidden information about his medical fitness for office and governed as if his close victory was a landslide replete with a mandate for rapid, even radical, change — all things he blasted Biden for.\n\nBlame populism for some epic partisan flip-flops\n\nPopulism is a culprit. In a campaign, it’s easy to reflect anger and promise action or retribution. When the time comes to address complex problems such as grocery prices, it can be hard to move quickly or effectively.\n\nWe’ve also come to expect, even accept, that the parties will flip-flop on certain issues based on whether they hold the White House. Democrats loved it when Barack Obama rewrote immigration policy without Congress. When Trump acts unilaterally, they yelp about autocracy. Republicans base their concern level about federal deficits or debt on the outcome of each election. And don’t even try to make sense of what each party truly thinks about partisan redistricting.\n\nThat’s politics. But these latest examples — if you’ll indulge a quick tribute to the late “This Is Spinal Tap” director Rob Reiner — go to 11.\n\nDemocrats scoffed when anyone during Biden’s presidency suggested that maybe Democratic policy of pouring more borrowed federal money into a flush economy could spike prices. Now, they suddenly can’t talk enough about “affordability.” Housing, groceries, cars — Democrats blame Trump for persistent inflation without even acknowledging that layers upon layers of government regulation they championed makes goods more complicated to make and thus more expensive.\n\nTexas Rep. Jasmine Crockett, announcing her run for Senate, said with a straight face that prices had tripled in a year under Trump. If that were remotely true, it would rank among the all-time inflation disasters, the kind that requires wheelbarrows to carry enough devalued cash to buy a meal.\n\nDemocrats denied Biden’s decline but dwell on Trump’s health\n\nBiden’s four years in office were marked by a steady deterioration of his speech, mobility and clarity. White House aides insisted he was fine, even robust. It wasn’t until Biden’s disastrous performance in a debate that they reacted to what anyone could see.\n\nEven then, they did so not out of concern over whether the country was in steady hands but over the prospect of losing an election. They insisted that while Biden should no longer seek another term, he was fine to stay in office for six more months. His incoherence seems to have been contagious.\n\nNow, some Democrats see a stubborn bruise on Trump’s hand and a 79-year-old man nearly nodding off in a long meeting and declare it’s time to invoke the 25th Amendment and remove him from office.\n\nTrump plays the same kind of games with his health information. When the president goes for an unscheduled medical exam, as Trump recently did, the country deserves the full story. We don’t even know what caused Trump’s doctors enough concern to order an MRI.\n\nAnd then, there’s Epstein. To hear Democrats over the last few months, there was no higher priority than finding out exactly who might have indulged in heinous crimes with him or helped cover them up. Lawmakers who couldn’t bring themselves to ask if Biden was functional decided transparency was suddenly the nation’s highest priority.\n\nWhat happened during the years in which the Biden administration could have revealed much of the same information? Sure didn’t hear much out of Democrats, then. That’s because for every Trump reference in the much ballyhooed “Epstein files,” there’s probably something to implicate a Democrat or one of the party’s important donors.\n\nBack to Trump for one final example. Biden’s administration tried to pin high food prices on grocers, who typically have low profit margins. Kamala Harris campaigned on a promise to ban “price gouging” in food production. Republicans rightly scoffed that it was a distraction for bad policies. Trump called Harris’ idea “communist.”\n\nNow, Comrade Trump has ordered up an investigation of … wait for it … “price fixing” in the food industry. He’s aiming primarily at foreign companies, but then, the Soviets loved to blame their failed economies on other countries’ meddling, too.\n\nIt’s too much to expect purity in politics. Even a strain of basic consistency is more than some partisans can manage.\n\nBut it fuels the costly cynicism that has Americans throwing up their hands at politics and turning to impossible populist promises. That’s a kind of inflation we can ill afford.\n\nThis story was originally published December 19, 2025 at 10:39 AM.","url":"https://www.kansascity.com/opinion/article313820498.html","image":"https://www.star-telegram.com/public/latest-news/1y2aum/picture313820946/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/2251913094-GI.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-19 16:39:44","author":"Andrew Harnik","authors":["Andrew Harnik"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.031},{"id":387639264,"title":"Christian Datoc says Trump needs to change his messaging on economy","text":"Datoc said Trump entered office with “some of the highest” approval ratings, but they have steadily decreased. \n\nDatoc emphasized the “most frightening” number for the president, the White House, and Republicans’ hopes of maintaining their majority in Congress is Trump’s economic polling. \n\nJust 33% of adults in the United States approve of the president’s handling of the economy, according to a Reuters-Ipsos poll.\n\nDatoc highlighted that this is a 12-point dip from when Trump entered office. \n\n“This is supposed to be the issue, along with immigration, that really sets him apart.

That&#8217;s a mistake.","text":"When Ken Martin was elected chair of the Democratic National Committee in February, he promised a report investigating what went wrong for his party in 2024. “The reality is what we need to do right now is really start to get a handle around what happened last election cycle,” he told reporters. “We know that we lost ground with Latino voters, we know we lost ground with women and younger voters and of course working-class voters. We don’t know the how and why yet.”\n\nTen months later, Martin has made a remarkable reversal. He will not release the long-awaited autopsy, he announced on Thursday, even though it’s done. Despite months of work — including hundreds of interviews with party operatives in all 50 states — and a pledge to use the report to drive the party forward, Martin appears to have decided that publishing it would be a “distraction.” \n\nThat the DNC is mothballing whatever audit it could bring itself to conduct underscores that the party remains petrified of its own reflection.\n\n“In our conversations with stakeholders from across the Democratic ecosystem, we are aligned on what’s important, and that’s learning from the past and winning the future. Here’s our North Star: does this help us win? If the answer is no, it’s a distraction from the core mission,” Martin said in a statement explaining his decision.\n\nStrangely, Martin doesn’t seem to perceive the conflict in deeming “learning from the past” important and then torpedoing his party’s attempt to do so. \n\nShelving the document isn’t exactly a disaster: Leaks to the press as the DNC autopsy was being assembled suggested that the report would be a comically superficial analysis, mostly thanks to the committee’s narrow scope of investigation. But combine the less-than-rigorous postmortem and the about-face on releasing it, and Democrats should be embarrassed. \n\nTo understand how allergic the party remains to any serious introspection, consider that in July, The New York Times, citing people briefed on the process of the DNC audit, reported that it was “expected to avoid the questions of whether former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. should have run for re-election in the first place, whether he should have exited the race earlier than he did and whether former Vice President Kamala Harris was the right choice to replace him.” The audit also wasn’t expected to revisit important Harris campaign decisions, the Times reported, including “framing the election as a choice between democracy and fascism, and refraining from hitting back after an ad by Donald J. Trump memorably attacked Ms. Harris on transgender rights.”\n\nApparently the DNC was terrified from the outset of any serious reckoning with the many things it got wrong last year. (The Times’ July article had this great zinger: “Party officials described the draft document as focusing on the 2024 election as a whole, but not on the presidential campaign — which is something like eating at a steakhouse and then reviewing the salad.”) It could, of course, be divisive to reconsider the biggest decisions defining the election. But that is precisely the kind of thing a party has to endure when it has record-low approval from its own voters and voters have handed the keys to the republic over to a narcissistic and self-enriching demagogue for a second time. \n\nWe don’t know what the unpublished report ended up concluding, but the Times reported Thursday that the “prescriptions were more tactical than strategic,” citing DNC officials’ summary of the findings. Among other things, the audit reportedly questioned the efficacy of peer-to-peer text messaging in influencing voters, as well as door-knocking quotas. This is an entirely different universe of self-scrutiny than the reflections suggested by those of us who have long argued that the party had no real policy vision or that Biden’s age was a threat to his candidacy.\n\nTo be sure, a party autopsy wouldn’t preclude future mistakes. And the reality is that a strong Democratic candidate could disregard its lessons and still win, as President Donald Trump did in 2016.\n\nStill, the fact that the DNC is mothballing whatever audit it could bring itself to conduct underscores that the party remains petrified of its own reflection. The document might have been weak sauce, but releasing it would have at least created a record of how the party viewed itself and laid out the parameters of how the establishment was and wasn’t willing to change to meet the challenges of our era. It would have become a potential source of accountability — even if primarily through criticism from progressives in and outside the party about how the self-assessment didn’t go far enough. \n\nThe Democratic establishment, trying to save face, is sweeping some hard truths under the rug. Doing so all but ensures that it won’t evolve into a party worthy of the country’s trust.","url":"https://www.ms.now/opinion/dnc-autopsy-report-2024-ken-martin","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/msnow/images/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630/f_auto,q_auto/v1766089486/251218-ken-martin-es/251218-ken-martin-es.jpg?_i=AA","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-19 16:21:27","author":"Zeeshan Aleem","authors":["Zeeshan Aleem"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.478},{"id":387639270,"title":"Ocasio-Cortez has a ‘real shot’ at the presidency by following Trump 2024 model","text":"Many of the political pros think she may be on to something, especially since no Democrat has seized the 2028 mantle.

That means patriotism and American history will be front and center as we inch closer to the Fourth of July. We couldn't be happier that President Trump will be leading the nation on that momentous day instead of Kamala Harris, and we're sure the celebrations will be ones to remember.\n\nFor one social media content creator, 2026 is also an opportunity to help spread the messages of American history and American patriotism both on- and offline.\n\nMatt Stanton started the USA and American Flag accounts on Instagram. Townhall recently spoke with him about his social media efforts and his vision for the future.\n\n\"I'm trying to build a pocket in the social media universe, connecting people through patriotism and the American flag,\" Stanton said. \"The way America is right now, if you post patriotic stuff, people just assume you're aligned with Trump.\"\n\nStanton says the America-flag type patriotism should be the \"north star,\" and his focus is to \"give people shareable content that's not overly in support of a candidate.\"\n\n\"It's effective,\" Stanton said. \"If I just got a patriotic message out there, it'll help bring people in and unify people.\"\n\nStanton said he'd also like to help champion other content creators like Teag \"Pure Joy\" McCoy, Staton sees it as a way to springboard patriotic content creators. \n\n\"Going into 2026, building a core audience around patriotism and trying to use it as a launchpad for individual creators to really amplify their voice and provide a platform for their voice,\" Staton said, will help \"grow their content and bring people together under the flag and patriotism.\"\n\nStanton noted the Townhall readership embraces this patriotism, and when readers share content like a crowd chanting \"USA\" at a sporting event, he said, \"It helps bring people together and indirectly elevates patriotism.\"\n\nDeveloping that patriotism is important. During the conversation with Townhall, Stanton discussed Alec Penstone, the 100-year-old British World War II veteran. Penstone joined Good Morning Britain on Remembrance Day and tearfully said the sacrifices his generation made during that war weren't worth it.\n\n\"My message is, I can see in my mind's eye those rows and rows of white stones and all the hundreds of my friends who gave their lives, for what? The country of today? No, I'm sorry - but the sacrifice wasn't worth the result of what it is now,\" Penstone said. \"What we fought for was our freedom, but now it's a darn sight worse than when I fought for it.\"\n\nStanton said he found the interviewer's demeanor off-putting. \"Her reaction was so elitist and so dismissive of him,\" Stanton remarked. He added that it was important to pay attention to things across the pond. \"What happens in Europe generally migrates to the U.S. in terms of governmental policies and all that stuff.\"\n\nAfter the July assassination attempt against President Trump, Stanton said he saw a rise in patriotism. \"A lot of hidden Trump supporters came out of the woodwork,\" he noted. \"Elon Musk was probably the most influential of those.\"\n\nStanton, who has worked closely with the entire Turning Point USA organization for years, was also deeply impacted by the assassination of founder Charlie Kirk in September.\n\nHe described the Turning Point staff as \"absolutely great people\" and said, \"After the Charlie Kirk assassination, it really kind of mobilized the youth and everyone like that to take the reins and start smaller accounts, which have grown and seen more shares, especially in patriotic content.\"\n\nBut that outspoken patriotism also comes with risks. Stanton said the recent shooting at Brown University, where sophomore Ella Cook, vice president of the school's College Republicans, was killed, along with MukhammadAziz Umurzokov, a freshman from Uzbekistan. Stanton said that the shooting was just as scary as Kirk's.\n\nHe noted that many conservative influencers are facing increased threats to their safety. \"The Left always likes to say the right is the side of violence, but if you’re a Kamlaa Harris or a Democrat influencer, you’re not paying money for security,\" Stanton said.\n\nDespite that, he's hopeful and optimistic for the future. When it comes to building social media, he says there's a lot of strategy, including having certain \"content pillars.\"\n\n\"There are certain phrases that I lean into, like 'The European mind cannot comprehend' or 'Share with a patriot,'\" Stanton said. Those things make content that's designed to be shareable and relatable. He also said staying abreast of news and things that are trending on X, Google, and Facebook can help drive content and sharing.\n\n\"Have a plan, if you want to be a social media creator...have a plan and stick with it,\" Staton said. \"You're not going to grow thousands of followers overnight, but if you're consistent with it...you have to make sure you stick to that plan. I stuck to a plan and I was able to grow this thing.\"\n\nThe USA Instagram account has 1.3 million followers, and the American Flag Instagram account has more than 225,000 followers.\n\nWhen asked about burnout, Stanton said, \"Burnout does exist, and you have to figure out a way to cope with the burnout.\"\n\n\"I work 24/7,\" Stanton said. I post basically every single day. It can be exhausting at times. You just really have to be passionate for the subject matter you're building these pages around.\"\n\nEditor’s Note: Every single day, here at Townhall, we will stand up and FIGHT, FIGHT, FIGHT against the radical left and deliver the conservative reporting our readers deserve.\n\nHelp us continue to tell the truth about the Trump administration and its successes.

Marketing did.","text":"I oppose Zohran Mamdani’s Democratic Socialist agenda. But if Republicans are serious about winning elections next year and in 2028, they need to take a hard, unsentimental look at how he just won one of the most consequential mayoral races in the country.\n\nThis was not an ideological earthquake. New York did not suddenly “discover” socialism. What happened was a marketing and mobilization breakthrough. Mamdani’s campaign understood attention, simplicity, participation, and distribution better than anyone else in the race.\n\nRepublicans often confuse seriousness with stiffness. Mamdani showed that message discipline does not require lifelessness.\n\nJoe Perello, the city of New York’s first chief marketing officer, noted in PRWeek after Mamdani’s victory that the campaign did more than communicate a message. It built an engine that converted online engagement into real-world turnout.\n\n“For marketers and strategists alike, the implications are clear,” Perello wrote. “Growth hacking, iterative testing, and data-driven amplification can convert digital sentiment into real-world behavior. In Mamdani’s case, that meant converting hearts, clicks, and hashtags into ballots.”\n\nHere is the part many on the right do not want to hear: Mamdani did not spend his time lecturing working-class voters about the virtues of socialism or defending failed economic theory. He focused on immediate, kitchen-table concerns and paired them with simple, slogan-ready answers.\n\nIs halal food expensive? Make it cheaper. Struggling to get to work? Free buses. Grocery bills too high? Government-run grocery stores.\n\nHe took Bernie Sanders’ 2016-era talking points and filtered them through a polished, Obama-style optimism that voting-age New Yorkers were willing to engage with.\n\nMost voters do not have the time — or patience — to think through how these promises would actually work. They just want to hear that someone intends to make their lives easier.\n\nAs Citizens Alliance CEO Cliff Maloney observed during Mamdani’s surge in the polls, the public’s lack of understanding about how government operates — and how socialism consistently fails — created the political environment Mamdani exploited. He did not create that environment. He mastered it.\n\nRepublicans’ digital blind spot\n\nFor years, Republican campaigns have treated digital media as messaging rather than infrastructure. Social platforms are used as megaphones for press releases, fundraising tools, or dumping grounds for cable-news clips. The underlying assumption is that persuasion happens elsewhere — on TV, at rallies, through mailers — and that digital simply amplifies those efforts.\n\nMamdani reversed that logic. Social media was not an accessory to his campaign. It was the campaign.\n\nHis approach drew praise even from outlets like the Guardian, where journalist Adam Gabbatt noted that Mamdani “has won social media with clips that are always fun — and resolutely on-message.”\n\nHis team treated TikTok and Instagram like serious growth channels. Short videos were not vanity content; they were experiments. Different neighborhoods, different faces, different tones, different pacing. What held attention? What sparked comments? What traveled across boroughs? Each post generated data, and each data point informed the next iteration.\n\nThis was politics run as a full-funnel acquisition strategy. Awareness led to engagement. Engagement led to identification. Identification led to turnout. Republicans can mock the aesthetics, but the mechanics work.\n\nEnergy is a signal\n\nOne of the most underrated elements of Mamdani’s campaign was how it looked. He was constantly in motion — walking Manhattan, running a marathon, bouncing between boroughs. Rarely behind a lectern. Rarely static. Always visible.\n\nThat energy communicated youth, optimism, and confidence in the same way John F. Kennedy outperformed Richard Nixon on television in 1960. A similar contrast appeared in 2024, when Donald Trump’s unscripted, high-visibility media strategy stood in sharp contrast to Joe Biden’s and Kamala Harris’ tightly controlled appearances.\n\nThe predictable response on the right is dismissal. ‘That’s just TikTok nonsense.’ ‘Our voters aren’t like that.’ Those excuses are comforting — and dangerously wrong.\n\nIn an age of low trust and low information, energy reads as competence. Movement suggests effort. Visibility substitutes for familiarity. Mamdani’s omnipresence created the impression — fair or not — that he was accessible and engaged with everyday life.\n\nRepublicans often confuse seriousness with stiffness. Mamdani showed that message discipline does not require lifelessness.\n\nRELATED: When Bernie Sanders and I agree on AI, America had better pay attention\n\n Photo by ANGELA WEISS/AFP via Getty Images\n\nFrom supporters to fans\n\nThe most uncomfortable lesson for traditional campaigns is that Mamdani did not just mobilize voters. He activated fandom.\n\nMuch of the campaign content that flooded social media did not come from official accounts. It came from supporters remixing clips, creating fan art, cutting moments to music, and sharing them within their own networks. The campaign made Mamdani easy to clip, easy to celebrate, and then got out of the way.\n\nWired magazine described it as a rare case of participatory political culture usually reserved for celebrities.\n\nThis matters because peer-to-peer persuasion scales faster and carries more credibility than anything a campaign can manufacture. Fan-made content travels further, feels more authentic, and costs nothing. Republicans, by contrast, tend to over-police their messaging, choking off organic enthusiasm in the name of control.\n\nYounger voters understand fandom instinctively. They grew up online. Mamdani did not lecture them about politics; he gave them something to belong to.\n\nThe wrong reaction\n\nThe predictable response on the right is dismissal. “That only works for Democrats.” “That’s just TikTok nonsense.” “Our voters aren’t like that.”\n\nThose excuses are comforting — and dangerously wrong.\n\nTrump understood this dynamic in 2024 when his campaign was largely shut out of legacy media. Figures like Charlie Kirk reached millions of Gen Z voters by blending serious political content with the humor and energy of youth activism.\n\nAlgorithms do not have ideologies. Participation is not a left-wing monopoly. Visibility, simplicity, and community are not progressive inventions. In a low-information, high-attention environment, the side that understands distribution wins.\n\nThe real danger is not Mamdani’s policies alone. It is a Republican Party that keeps confusing being correct with being effective.\n\nRELATED: How anti-fascism became the West’s civil religion\n\n Blaze Media Illustration\n\nWhat Republicans should learn — now\n\nFirst, treat digital as organizing, not advertising. Stop thinking in posts and start thinking in systems. How does attention become action?\n\nSecond, simplicity wins. Republicans often pride themselves on being right — and then lose because they are incomprehensible. Clarity scales. Long explanations do not.\n\nThird, loosen control. Let supporters remix, clip, and share. Reach matters more than perfect phrasing.\n\nFinally, build communities, not just campaigns. Email lists decay. Ad budgets run out. Communities endure.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nI do not agree with Zohran Mamdani’s politics, and I do not want his policies implemented anywhere. But ignoring how he won would be malpractice.\n\nHe demonstrated how power is built today — not through party machinery or television dominance, but through attention, participation, and relentless simplicity. Republicans can learn from that reality, or they can keep losing to it.\n\nDisagree with his ideology. But study his marketing. Ignore the lesson at your own risk.","url":"https://www.theblaze.com/columns/opinion/socialism-didnt-win-new-york-marketing-did","image":"https://www.theblaze.com/media-library/socialism-didnt-win-new-york-marketing-did.jpg?id=62607537&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C85%2C0%2C86","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-19 16:00:00","author":"Remso W.

But the fighting soon settled into grinding battles, and Moscow’s troops have made slow and steady progress over the years. Putin frequently touts this progress — even though it’s not the lightning advance many expected.“Our troops are advancing all across the line of contact, faster in some areas or slower in some others, but the enemy is retreating in all sectors,” Putin said at the live news conference, which is combined with a nationwide call-in show that offers Russians across the country the opportunity to ask questions of their leader.Putin, 73, has ruled the country for 25 years and uses the event to cement his power and air his views on domestic and global affairs during a broadcast that mixes criticism of the West with promises of more social payments. Although he is sometimes asked about his personal life, he gives scant details.This year, the news conference took place against the backdrop of a peace plan in Ukraine put forward by U.S. President Donald Trump. Despite the extensive diplomatic push, Washington’s efforts have run into sharply conflicting demands from Moscow and Kyiv.While the event has previously focused heavily on domestic questions — and has offered Putin a chance to expound on topics from the price of eggs to water cuts — Ukraine dominated it this year. Since it is highly choreographed, that could reflect the Kremlin’s desire to assuage the public after nearly four years of fighting.Putin praised Trump’s peace efforts and reaffirmed that Moscow was ready for a peaceful settlement that would address the “root causes” of the conflict, a reference to the Kremlin’s tough conditions for a deal. He said he has agreed to make “certain compromises” and “uneasy decisions” at the Alaska summit with Trump in August but didn’t elaborate.He wants all the areas in four key regions captured by his forces, as well as the Crimean Peninsula, illegally annexed in 2014, to be recognized as Russian territory. He has also insisted that Ukraine withdraw from some areas in eastern Ukraine that Moscow’s forces haven’t captured yet. Kyiv has publicly rejected all these demands.The Kremlin has also insisted that Ukraine abandon its bid to join NATO and warned that it wouldn’t accept the deployment of any troops from members of the military alliance members and would view them as “legitimate target.”Putin also has repeatedly said Ukraine must limit the size of its army and give official status to the Russian language — demands he has made from the outset of the conflict.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has expressed readiness to drop Ukraine’s bid to join NATO if the U.S. and other Western nations give Kyiv security guarantees similar to those offered to alliance members. But at the same time, he has emphasized that Ukraine believes NATO membership remains the best security guarantee.\"The United States don’t see us in NATO, for now,” Zelenskyy said this week. “Politicians change.”Commenting on Zelenskyy’s statement that he was ready to call a presidential election if a ceasefire is established, Putin responded that Russia has held elections without demanding a truce. He said that Moscow was ready to consider the issue and could agree to halt attacks deep inside Ukraine on the election day, but noted that millions of Ukrainians living in Russia must have the right to vote. Ukraine introduced martial law banning elections, but Russia hasn’t made such a move.Putin rebuffed Western claims about purported Russian plans to attack European nations as “sheer nonsense” aimed at deflecting public attention from domestic problems.He particularly singled out NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte for his statements about the Kremlin’s aggressive intentions, pointing out Trump’s recently published national security strategy that doesn’t name Russia as a direct adversary. “How can you prepare NATO for a war with Russia if the main member of NATO doesn’t consider us as an enemy?” Putin said.He alleged that European elites “impudently” backed Trump’s Democratic rival Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election and now hope the U.S. political landscape will change after the midterm elections to Congress, helping raise pressure on the White House.As it faces grinding Russian advances across the front line and relentless attacks on its energy facilities, Ukraine desperately cash infusions from its Western allies.On Friday, European Union leaders agreed to provide a massive interest-free loan, but they failed to bridge differences with Belgium that would have allowed them to use frozen Russian assets to raise the funds.The leaders tried to reassure Belgium, where most of the frozen assets are held, that they would protect it from any retaliation from Moscow if it backed the plan, but the leaders eventually opted to borrow the money on capital markets.Using Russian assets to help Kyiv would have amounted to “robbery,” Putin said, adding that the move would have spooked investors, “dealing not only an image blow but undermining confidence in the eurozone.”Putin said the flow of volunteer soldiers has remained strong, topping 400,000 this year. It was not possible to independently verify that claim since little is known about the recruitment effort.But the government offers relatively high pay and extensive benefits that have helped swell troop ranks. The Kremlin says it exclusively relies on volunteers to fight in Ukraine, but some media reports and rights groups have said that military officers often coerce conscripts into signing military contracts.Asked by a soldier’s widow about slow pension payments, Putin apologized and vowed the issue would be quickly resolved — a typical exchange at the annual event, which he often uses to show his command of a wide array of subjects and his ability to solve problems.The news conference featured questions from journalists in the Gostinny Dvor amphitheater as well as via video links from across Russia. A young man in a red bow tie who held a placard saying he wanted to get married used his question to Putin to propose to his girlfriend. Later, one of the anchors hosting the event reported that she had answered “yes,” and Putin joked about collecting money for the wedding.Also Read- 'Olga, Will You Marry Me?': Man Proposes To Girlfriend During Putin's Live Presser | VIDEO","summary":"President Vladimir Putin emphasized Friday that Moscow’s troops were advancing across the battlefield in Ukraine.

Honig said on “CNN News Central” that Attorney General Pam Bondi does not have to go into specific details on why certain documents are being withheld from the public.\n\n“DOJ can withhold information relating to ongoing criminal investigations. Now, what criminal investigations are out there? We don’t know. DOJ knows they’re going to be able to redact out information relating to that. And third, any information that might undermine or impact national security or foreign policy. A lot of play there, a lot of wiggle room, a lot of discretion in Pam Bondi’s hands,” Honig said. \n\n“So, so how will we know if we’re getting everything? How will we know if anything’s being withheld?” CNN host John Berman asked. \n\n“We won’t know, nor will Congress,” Honig responded. “The law does require the AG to provide written notification to Congress of anything they withheld, but that’s sort of vague. That’s subject to interpretation. I mean, it could be enough under the law for Pam Bondi to say, ‘dear Congress, dear world, be advised, I have withheld certain materials because they relate to criminal investigations because they relate to national security,’ period. And then there’s not a heck of a lot we can do to get underneath that.” (RELATED: Kamala Harris Goes To Bat For Biden Administration Over Not Releasing Epstein Files)\n\nHonig previously criticized Bondi in July over her handling of the files, stating that she made “grandiose promises” that she had failed to fulfill.\n\n“Are there others where the FBI or DOJ has evidence that could have led to criminal charges? I’m not so interested in, in sort of just all the atmospherics, but are there people who evaded meaningful criminal liability here?” Honig said. \n\nThe files gained national attention after the DOJ and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) concluded in July that Epstein committed suicide in his jail cell and that he never possessed a client list. The memo was an abrupt end to the investigation after Bondi stated that she had the client list on her desk for review.\n\nTrump initially opposed releasing the files, but later changed his tune by saying that he had nothing to hide.

The Epoch Times has reached out to the DNC for further information, but did not receive a response by publication time.\n\nKamala Harris, who was vice president at the time, lost the 2024 election to Republican Donald Trump, who returned to the White House for a second term. Harris stepped in as the Democratic presidential candidate after then-President Joe Biden withdrew his bid.\n\nDuring an Oct. 26 interview with BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg, Harris suggested that she may run for the presidency again in 2028.\n\n“I am not done,” she said. \n\n“I have lived my entire career, a life of service, and it’s in my bones, and there are many ways to serve. I’ve not decided yet what I will do in the future beyond what I am doing right now.”\n\nThe interview took place as Harris was on tour promoting her book “107 Days,” released on Sept. 23, detailing the days she spent running for president against Trump last year.\n\nCalifornia Gov.

Pero la lucha pronto degeneró en batallas desgastantes, y las tropas de Moscú han logrado un avance lento pero constante a lo largo de los años. Putin frecuentemente alardea de este progreso, aunque no es el impulso relámpago que muchos esperaban.\n\n“Nuestras tropas avanzan a lo largo de toda la línea de contacto, más rápido en algunas áreas o más lento en otras, pero el enemigo retrocede en todos los sectores”, dijo Putin en la conferencia de prensa en vivo, que se combina con un programa de llamadas a escala nacional que ofrece a los rusos de todo el país la oportunidad de hacer preguntas a su líder.\n\nPutin, de 73 años, ha gobernado el país durante 25 años y utiliza el evento para consolidar su poder y expresar sus opiniones sobre asuntos nacionales y globales.\n\nEste año, la conferencia de prensa tuvo lugar en el contexto de un plan de paz en Ucrania propuesto por el presidente de Estados Unidos, Donald Trump. A pesar del amplio despliegue diplomático, los esfuerzos de Washington se han topado con demandas fuertemente conflictivas de Moscú y Kiev.\n\nAunque anteriormente el evento se centraba fuertemente en cuestiones nacionales —y daba a Putin la oportunidad de explayarse sobre temas que iban desde el precio de los huevos hasta los cortes de agua—, Ucrania fue el tema dominante este año. Dado que el programa está perfectamente coreografiado, eso podría reflejar el deseo del Kremlin de tranquilizar al público después de casi cuatro años de lucha.\n\nLas demandas rusas permanecen sin cambios\n\nPutin reafirmó que Moscú estaba listo para llegar a un acuerdo pacífico donde se aborden las “causas fundamentales” del conflicto, una referencia a las duras condiciones del Kremlin para un acuerdo.\n\nEl líder ruso quiere que todas las áreas de cuatro regiones clave capturadas por sus fuerzas, así como la península de Crimea, anexada ilegalmente en 2014, sean reconocidas como territorio ruso. También ha insistido en que Ucrania se retire de algunas áreas del este del país que las fuerzas de Moscú aún no han capturado. Kiev ha rechazado públicamente todas estas demandas.\n\nEl Kremlin también ha insistido en que Ucrania abandone su intento de unirse a la OTAN y advirtió que no aceptaría el despliegue de tropas de miembros de la alianza militar y los consideraría como un “objetivo legítimo”.\n\nPutin también ha dicho repetidamente que Ucrania debe limitar el tamaño de su ejército y dar estatus oficial al idioma ruso, demandas que ha hecho desde el inicio del conflicto.\n\nEl presidente ucraniano Volodymyr Zelenskyy ha expresado su disposición a abandonar el intento de Ucrania de unirse a la OTAN si Estados Unidos y otras naciones occidentales le dan a Kiev garantías de seguridad similares a las ofrecidas a los miembros de la alianza. Pero al mismo tiempo, ha enfatizado que Ucrania cree que la membresía en la OTAN sigue siendo la mejor garantía de seguridad.\n\n“Estados Unidos no nos ve en la OTAN, por ahora”, dijo Zelenskyy esta semana. “Los políticos cambian”.\n\nAl hablar sobre la declaración de Zelenskyy de que estaba listo para convocar una elección presidencial si se establece un alto el fuego, Putin respondió que Rusia ha celebrado elecciones sin exigir una tregua. Dijo que Moscú estaba listo para considerar el tema y podría acordar detener los ataques en el interior de Ucrania el día de las elecciones, pero señaló que millones de ucranianos que viven en Rusia deben tener derecho a votar.\n\nPutin rechazó las afirmaciones occidentales sobre supuestos planes rusos para atacar a naciones europeas calificándolas como “puras tonterías” destinadas a desviar la atención pública de los problemas internos.\n\nSeñaló particularmente al secretario general de la OTAN, Mark Rutte, por sus declaraciones sobre las intenciones agresivas del Kremlin, mencionando la estrategia de seguridad nacional recientemente publicada por Trump, en la que no se nombra a Rusia como un adversario directo. “¿Cómo puedes preparar a la OTAN para una guerra con Rusia si el principal miembro de la OTAN no nos considera un enemigo?” dijo Putin.\n\nAlegó que las élites europeas respaldaron “descaradamente” a la rival demócrata de Trump, Kamala Harris, en las elecciones presidenciales de 2024 y ahora esperan que el panorama político de Estados Unidos cambie después de las elecciones intermedias para el Congreso, ayudando a aumentar la presión sobre la Casa Blanca.\n\nPutin advierte que cualquier incautación de activos rusos tendrá consecuencias\n\nMientras enfrenta los constantes avances rusos a lo largo de la línea del frente y los implacables ataques a sus instalaciones energéticas, Ucrania está al borde de la bancarrota y necesita desesperadamente más dinero de sus aliados occidentales.\n\nEl viernes, los líderes de la Unión Europea acordaron proporcionar un gran préstamo sin intereses, pero no lograron superar las diferencias con Bélgica que les habrían permitido usar activos rusos congelados para recaudar los fondos.\n\nLos líderes intentaron asegurar a Bélgica, donde se encuentran la mayoría de los activos congelados, que la protegerían de cualquier represalia de Moscú si apoyaba el plan, pero finalmente optaron por pedir prestado el dinero en los mercados de capitales.\n\nPutin dijo que usar activos rusos para ayudar a Kiev habría equivalido a un “robo”, y agregó que la medida habría ahuyentado a los inversores, “causando no solo un golpe de imagen sino socavando la confianza en la eurozona”.\n\nPutin dice que el número de soldados es sólido\n\nPutin dijo a la audiencia que el flujo de soldados voluntarios se ha mantenido fuerte, superando los 400.000 este año. No fue posible verificar de manera independiente esa afirmación, ya que se sabe poco sobre el esfuerzo de reclutamiento.\n\nPero el gobierno ofrece salarios relativamente altos y amplios beneficios que han ayudado a aumentar las filas del Ejército. El Kremlin dice que emplea exclusivamente voluntarios para luchar en Ucrania, pero algunos informes de medios y grupos de derechos han dicho que los oficiales militares a menudo coaccionan a los reclutas para que firmen contratos con las fuerzas armadas.\n\nCuando la viuda de un soldado le preguntó sobre la lentitud en el pago de una pensión, Putin se disculpó y prometió que el problema se resolvería rápidamente, un diálogo típico del evento anual, que el líder ruso utiliza a menudo para mostrar su dominio de una amplia gama de temas y su capacidad para resolver problemas.\n\nEn la conferencia de prensa se incluyeron preguntas de periodistas en el anfiteatro Gostinny Dvor, así como a través de un enlace de video desde toda Rusia. Un joven con una pajarita roja que sostenía un cartel diciendo que quería casarse usó su pregunta a Putin para proponerle matrimonio a su novia. Más tarde, uno de los presentadores del evento informó que ella había respondido “sí”, y Putin bromeó sobre recaudar dinero para la boda.\n\nEsta historia fue traducida del inglés por un editor de AP con la ayuda de una herramienta de inteligencia artificial generativa.","summary":"Por HARRIET MORRIS MOSC&#218; (AP) &#8212; El presidente ruso Vlad&#237;mir Putin enfatiz&#243; el viernes que las tropas de Mosc&#250; avanzan en el campo de batalla en Ucrania y expres&#243; su confianza en que el Kremlin lograr&#237;a sus objetivos militares si Kiev no acepta las condiciones de Rusia en las conversaciones de paz.

He said that Moscow was ready to consider the issue and could agree to halt attacks deep inside Ukraine on the election day, but noted that millions of Ukrainians living in Russia must have the right to vote.\n\nPutin rebuffed Western claims about purported Russian plans to attack European nations as “sheer nonsense” aimed at deflecting public attention from domestic problems.\n\nHe particularly singled out NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte for his statements about the Kremlin's aggressive intentions, pointing out Trump's recently published national security strategy that doesn’t name Russia as a direct adversary. “How can you prepare NATO for a war with Russia if the main member of NATO doesn't consider us as an enemy?” Putin said.\n\nHe alleged that European elites “impudently” backed Trump's Democratic rival Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election and now hope the U.S. political landscape will change after the midterm elections to Congress, helping raise pressure on the White House.\n\nPutin warns any seizure of Russian assets will backfire\n\nAs it faces grinding Russian advances across the front line and relentless attacks on its energy facilities, Ukraine is on the verge of bankruptcy — and it desperately needs more cash from its Western allies.\n\nOn Friday, European Union leaders agreed to provide a massive interest-free loan, but they failed to bridge differences with Belgium that would have allowed them to use frozen Russian assets to raise the funds.\n\nThe leaders tried to reassure Belgium, where most of the frozen assets are held, that they would protect it from any retaliation from Moscow if it backed the plan, but the leaders eventually opted to borrow the money on capital markets.\n\nPutin said using Russian assets to help Kyiv would have amounted to “robbery,” adding that the move would have spooked investors, “dealing not only an image blow but undermining confidence in the eurozone.”\n\nPutin says troop numbers are strong\n\nPutin told the audience the flow of volunteer soldiers has remained strong, topping 400,000 this year. It was not possible to independently verify that claim since little is known about the recruitment effort.\n\nBut the government offers relatively high pay and extensive benefits that have helped swell troop ranks. The Kremlin says that it exclusively relies on volunteers to fight in Ukraine, but some media reports and rights groups have said that military officers often coerce conscripts into signing military contracts.\n\nAsked by a soldier’s widow about the slowness in paying out a pension, Putin apologized and vowed that the issue would be quickly solved — an exchange typical of the annual event, which the Russian leader often uses to show his command of a wide array of subjects and his ability to solve problems.\n\nThe news conference featured questions from journalists in the Gostinny Dvor amphitheater as well as via video link from across Russia. A young man in a red bow tie who held a placard saying he wanted to get married used his question to Putin to propose to his girlfriend. Later, one of the anchors hosting the event reported that she had answered “yes,” and Putin joked about collecting money for the wedding.","summary":"President Vladimir Putin emphasized Friday that Moscow&rsquo;s troops were advancing across the battlefield in Ukraine and voiced confidence the Kremlin would achieve its goals militarily if Kyiv doesn&#39;t agree to Russia&#39;s conditions in peace talks.\n\nSpeaking at his tightly orchestrated ann...","url":"https://www.castanet.net/news/World/590260/Putin-tells-his-annual-news-conference-that-the-Kremlin-s-military-goals-will-be-achieved-in-Ukraine","image":"https://www.castanet.net/content/2025/12/3628a4c8e4be19faad5e5974c5210864dba0d3fc93858bb0bcb874ff395352d0.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-19 13:00:00","author":"Harriet Morris","authors":["Harriet Morris"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.079},{"id":387559020,"title":"Stephen A Smith argues with Rep Clyburn, says gender is not the reason people refused to support Harris","text":"Commentator Stephen A. Smith locked horns with Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., on Thursday, arguing that then-Vice President Kamala Harris' gender is not the reason why she lost to President Donald Trump. Clyburn condemned Trump during his appearance on Smith’s \"Straight Shooter\" podcast, describing him as a man who \"looks for opportunities to insult Black women\" day in and day out. \"That's one of the categories,\" Smith replied. \"Because, to me, he insults everybody.\" \"Well, nobody should be voting for him,\" Clyburn argued. When Smith highlighted that, nonetheless, millions of people did, Clyburn responded by arguing that the American people are confusing boisterous behavior with leadership. STEPHEN A SMITH LOCKS HORNS WITH WHOOPI, SAYS DEMS MUST FOCUS ON AFFORDABILITY AND SAFETY, NOT CULTURE WAR \"Is it possible that that's not what they did?\" Smith asked. \"That instead, what they did was look at the Democratic side, and say they didn't like what they were getting, because the Democratic side didn't represent what James Clyburn stands for. It didn't represent what others have stood for that are traditional members of the Democratic Party. They saw a change shifting within the Democratic Party that leaned a bit further left that were deemed to be just as unreasonable as folks on the far right and as a result they chose what they deem to be the best of two evils per se.\" \"Well, the question is why they didn't see it,\" Clyburn said. \"Maybe they couldn't get beyond gender and our nominee happened to have been a Black or an African American, Asian American woman.\" In the clip flagged by The Daily Caller, Smith locked horns with Clyburn on this, warning, \"Well, let me say this, because I'm not going to say this behind your back and not say it to your face.\" NANCY PELOSI RESPONDS TO MICHELLE OBAMA'S CLAIM THAT AMERICA ISN'T READY FOR WOMAN PRESIDENT, ASKS 'WHY NOT?' \"I'm sitting right here in front of you,\" Smith continued. \"I emphatically disagree with what you just alluded to in terms of ‘it might be gender-driven.’ I think about Hillary Rodham Clinton getting 2.9 million votes more than Trump in 2016. I think about Kamala Harris getting nearly 75 million votes… I think about governors in New York, governors-elects in Jersey and recently Virginia. I think about former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi who was considered one of the most influential figures in our nation's history.\" He went on to argue that if it were so obvious that there is a clear bias against having a female president, Harris would not have been chosen as Biden’s successor with only 107 days to campaign.
