That would be a good one. I'd like that.'\n\nAn Overton Insights survey of 1,100 registered voters, however, claimed that he might not love it so much, as Obama leads the dream head-to-head 53 percent to 47 percent over Trump.\n\nObama notably would dominate Trump among moderate and independent voters, taking 59 percent of independents and 61 percent of moderates.\n\nTrump's predecessor would also take 10 percent of his own 2024 voters, whereas he would only swipe 3 percent of Kamala Harris voters.\n\nThe current president added: 'I know people are asking me to run and there is a whole story about running for a third term. I don't know. I never looked into it. They do say there's a way you can do it, but I don't know about that.' \n\n'But I have not looked into it,' he continued. \n\nRight now, no Constitutional law allows Trump or Obama to run again in 2028.\n\nJust three days into Trump's second term, Rep. Andy Ogles, a Tennessee Republican, sent out a proposal to amend the 22nd Amendment to open the door for a Trump third term. \n\nOgles' Constitutional amendment would allow for Trump to run for a third term - but prohibit Obama from doing so, because the Democrat had already served two consecutive terms. \n\nThe other former two-term living presidents, Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Bill Clinton, also wouldn't be eligible if this amendment was passed. \n\n'No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than three times, nor be elected to any additional term after being elected to two consecutive term,' the text of the Ogles' Amendment read. \n\nThere's an incredibly high bar to pass a Constitutional amendment - as two-thirds of both the House and Senate would need to sign on - as well as three-fourths of the state legislatures. \n\nWith the current nearly 50/50 split in the country of Republicans and Democrats it's extremely unlikely an amendment of this kind would pass - especially one that only aims to allow Trump to serve thrice. \n\nYet the topic of a Trump third term again came up over the weekend, when the president talked to NBC Meet the Press host Kristen Welker by phone recently. \n\n'A lot of people want me to do it,' the 78-year-old president said. \n\nA chant of 'four more years' broke out at the White House last week during the president's Greek Independence Day event. \n\n'But, I mean, I basically tell them we have a long way to go, you know, it's very early in the administration,' he continued. 'I'm focused on the current.'\n\nWhen asked why he'd want another term, the president responded, 'I like working.' \n\n'I'm not joking,' he continued. 'But I'm not - it is far too early to think about it.' \n\nHe was then asked if he'd been presented with plans on how to serve a third term. \n\n'There are methods which you could do it,' he said. \n\nHe was asked about those comments on board Air Force One Sunday as he traveled back to Washington, D.C. \n\n'I don't want to talk about a third term now because no matter how you look at it, you've got a long time to go,' Trump said. \n\nObama, a longtime rival of Trump, has never expressed any interest in running for a third term.","summary":"A new poll breaks down how a hypothetical battle for a third term between Presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama would play out.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14585533/donald-trump-barack-obama-odds-winning-presidency-term.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/08/22/97059879-0-image-a-4_1744148115405.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/03/31/4546005981107171332/1024x576_MP4_4546005981107171332.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-08 23:39:25","author":"Editor,Stephen M.

That document allowed them to work while they waited to hear whether their asylum requests were being accepted or denied. So, they could work as an illegal, knowing it would take YEARS before their case was heard. The immigration department mailed them a social security number. No interview.

They just want to help people, especially the poor and downtrodden. When you ask them about illegal immigration, they will tell you that these are just poor people looking for a better life for themselves and their families. That’s why they were perfectly okay with a wide-open southern border and letting millions of people into the country. It was all about compassion. However, as the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) continues to dig into the twisted story of America’s finances, we are finding out that the compassion ruse is just that, another Democrat party scheme.”\n\nThe report said, “Antonio Gracias is a DOGE official. He was recently interviewed on the ‘All In’ podcast and told the real story on illegal immigration during the Biden administration that Democrats told us was absolutely not happening.\n\n“Gracias said that potentially millions of illegal immigrants who came into the country during the Biden administration have valid Social Security numbers. What Gracias describes is nothing short of an organized racket to import as many people as possible.”\n\nThe report noted there was “no identification verification process” in place.\n\n“The result: around 1.3 million illegal immigrants now receive Medicaid paid for by you, the taxpayer, and voilà, as an illegal immigrant, you will be grateful enough to keep voting Democrat in perpetuity.”\n\nGracias even explained that illegals had, in fact, voted in U.S. elections.\n\n“We looked at voter rolls and we found that thousands are registered to vote in friendly states. And we looked even further in those friendly states and found that many of those people had actually voted. It was shocking to us. If I hadn’t seen this with my own eyes, I wouldn’t believe it … it is shockingly bad. Included on those voter rolls were criminals and those who had names that matched ones on the federal Terror Watch List,” the report confirmed.","summary":"'MILLIONS received drivers licenses, some registered to vote and DOGE said some actually did vote'","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2025/04/keep-voting-democrat-in-perpetuity-illegal-aliens-gifted-with-medicaid-benefits-and-social-security-numbers-under-biden/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/joe-biden-video-screen-big-brother-1984.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-08 23:12:26","author":"Bob Unruh","authors":["Bob Unruh"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.327},{"id":309115040,"title":"18 slang words and phrases we can thank (or blame) Gen Z for","text":"SUBSCRIBE & SAVE\n\nLess than $3 per week\n\nView Profile\n\nThe Explainer\n\nTalking Points\n\nThe Week Recommends\n\nNewsletters\n\nFrom the Magazine\n\nThe Week Junior\n\nFood & Drink\n\nPersonal Finance\n\nAll Categories \n\nNewsletter sign up\n\nCulture & Life\n\n18 slang words and phrases we can thank (or blame) Gen Z for\n\nYounger Americans have put their stamp on our language with these neologisms\n\nNewsletter sign up\n\n'Rizz' is one of Gen Z's go-to words\n\n(Image credit: Josie Elias / Getty Images)\n\nDavid Faris \n\n8 April 2025\n\nEach new generation puts its mark on language in culture, in part by inventing words and phrases. Sometimes those new contributions to language describe new concepts or developments, but often they put a new spin on our understanding of existing ideas. Generation Z, commonly defined as those born between 1997 and 2012, is no exception, churning out a seemingly endless stream of new or altered language in ways that frequently puzzle their elders. If you feel like you need a glossary to stay up to date, you are in good company.\n\n\"Big yikes\" is a phrase used in response to \"something that's really embarrassing, disturbing, or shocking,\" said Reader's Digest. Using it \"expresses a strong sense of cringe, awkwardness or disapproval,\" said the International Center for Language Studies.\n\nAn adjective that means \"amazing, fantastic, lovely and cool,\" the word \"bussin'\" is commonly traced to a 2021 Tik Tok trend, said Today. \"It can also be used as a verb, in the form of \"buss,\" said Parents, and like so many words on this list, \"it actually has origins in African American Vernacular English.\n\nSubscribe to The Week\n\nEscape your echo chamber.

A high school student named Gaby Rasson is credited with inventing the term in 2013, and it is most frequently applied to dated fashion like skinny jeans and \"outmoded trappings of the millennial lifestyle,\" said Vogue.\n\nAnother word that Gen Zers will reach for when they want to lob an insult, \"cringe\" means something that is embarrassing for someone else, a someone who typically is not aware that what they are saying or doing is problematic or dated. It can be applied to a wide range of situations, including a \"superstitious email chain from your mom\" or accidentally double-tapping an old picture in the middle of a deep dive into someone's Instagram,\" said Bustle.\n\nInside the contested birth years of generations\nGen Z is embracing underconsumption\nGeneration Z: done with democracy?\nA term for \"a cool or sexy trend/style,\" said Parade, \"drip\" refers to a person's overall look. If someone is looking particularly good, you can also say that they are \"drippin.\" It \"isn't a new slang term, but it has experienced a renaissance in hip-hop over the past few years,\" said Genius.\n\nA \"flex\" is a \"showcase of accomplishments and self-promotion,\" said Forbes. The term is generally reserved for situations in which a person unnecessarily communicates information that makes them look good or highlights an achievement, similar to a \"humblebrag.\"\n\nA way of referring to a makeover or transformation, \"glow up\" can also mean to \"go from the bottom to the top to the point of disbelief,\" said Her Campus. A trend that has emerged in response has been to \"glow down,\" which means to remove the \"desire for physical improvement from the center of your life,\" said The Cut.\nHits different\nWhen they want to say that something is \"significantly better than usual or is way better,\" members of Gen Z will reach for the phrase \"hits different,\" said Urban Dictionary. It is for situations in which a song, article of clothing or food \"appeals to you in a unique way,\" said BBC. For example, we're hoping this article hits different than other efforts to document Gen Z slang.\n\nA catch-all term that applies to someone experiencing anxiety or depression, \"menty b\" is an abbreviated version of \"mental breakdown.\" It has \"become shorthand for something less than a full meltdown,\" said The Wall Street Journal, although some people worry that its overuse risks trivializing the kind of deeper emotional distress that is on the rise for younger people, driven by worries over, for example, climate change and elections.\n\nA word that expresses disappointment, \"mid\" refers to \"things that are essentially average or slightly below,\" said The New York Times. \"It is one of Gen Z's favorite insults,\" said Politico, and young people seem to take particular delight in aiming it at the bad taste of their elders.\n\nUnlike some of Gen Z's other slang innovations, \"no cap\" isn't an abbreviation or appropriation of existing language. It means \"no lie\" and \"​​often follows an unbelievable statement or serious question,\" said Bustle. And \"if you say someone is 'capping,' then you are saying they are lying,\" said USA Today.\n\nAn adjective that refers to someone who is desperate for attention or positive reinforcement, \"pick-me\" is most frequently \"used to describe a girl who does everything for external, mostly male validation,\" said CNN. Because of the term's negative connotations, it has generated backlash for being \"problematic and misogynistic and has even given rise to an anti-pick-me trend on social media.\"\n\nOxford's 2023 Word of the Year, \"Rizz\" is simply a \"shortened form of 'charisma'\" that \"emerged out of internet and gaming culture,\" said The New York Times. The word \"comes from Black cultures, as most American neologisms do\" said Vox. Someone with a great deal of charisma can be called a \"rizzler.\"\n\nWhen people want to say that something is cracking them up, they can remark that it is \"sending me.\" The phrase is \"the Gen Z equivalent of LOL,\" said Fortune. And while \"there is no official confirmation of where the phrase originated,\" said The Daily Dot, its frequency of use rose in the \"late 2010s.\"\n\nMeaning to be a fan or enthusiast of something, \"Stan\" has its roots in an Eminem song \"about a man who was pushed to the edge when his idol wouldn't answer his fan mail,\" said NPR. While it originally had somewhat negative connotations, today it \"can describe any fan, regardless of dedication,\" and does not necessarily imply obsessiveness, said USA Today.\n\nAnother word that is essentially just an abbreviation for a longer one, \"sus\" is short for \"suspicious\" or \"suspect.\" The neologism is traced to the \"online game \"Among Us,\" in which players try to determine who is an imposter working to sabotage their progress,\" said Business Insider. Like \"mid,\" it has emerged as a top-tier barb wielded by Gen Zers.\nUnderstood the assignment\nIf you do what you are expected to do, you have \"understood the assignment.\" It is \"a popular way to praise someone who is going above and beyond to do a good job,\" said Yahoo. It can also be a way of making a comparison, like someone on the political left saying that voters who cast a ballot for Kamala Harris in 2024 despite reservations about her position on the war in Gaza \"understood the assignment.\"\n\nA vibe is \"the overall atmosphere or feeling of a situation, person or place,\" said Forbes. The word is typically modified to be a phrase, including the \"vibes are off\" as a way of saying that someone does not feel good about a situation or development. Especially in its use as a verb to mean \"to kick back and hang out, or to get along,\" the usage is novel, said Oprah Daily.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox\nA free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nDavid Faris\n\nSocial Links Navigation\n\nDavid Faris is an associate professor of political science at Roosevelt University and the author of It's Time to Fight Dirty: How Democrats Can Build a Lasting Majority in American Politics.

The whole frame, including the script, was designed to elevate the Obamas by making it look like she was begging for their blessing. This was typical bulls**t. [Harris] had to fake surprise and enthusiasm.\"Harris then seemed to take a swipe at the couple for the act by expressing her shock when the couple called her up \"together.\"\n\nAs rumors started to swirl the couple sleep in \"separate bedrooms\" – it seems possible, by Harris' reaction, that it was well known in the political world before it hit the media.Amid all the rumors, the couple continue to share social media tributes for each other to celebrate Valentine's Day and birthdays. \n\nIn addition, Michelle still continues to pursue her podcast career, which isn't as successful as fans predicted it would be.\n\nAt the time of publishing, Michelle's new podcast IMO — co-hosted with her own brother Craig — is ranked at #34 on Spotify.On a recent episode, the former First Lady took a brutal swipe at her husband.\n\nFamous author and podcaster Jay Shetty asked Michelle if she \"would you be attracted to a guy who's not financially sound when you meet him?\"\n\n\"Uh, I married one,\" the former first lady said.\n\nShe added: \"I left my corporate firm when I met Barack. I had somebody who was like, 'I got your back. The risks you think you're taking, they aren't that crazy, and I'm here to help you.'\"Michelle continued: \"That's when I said, 'I would rather have that in a partner than a higher income. I would rather have somebody who is ready to do some hard things with me. But that meant I had to be ready to do some hard things with him\"\n\nThe couple met in 1988 when Barack took a job at a Chicago law firm for the summer, where Michelle was already working on marketing and intellectual property law.","summary":"The secretly divorcing' Obamas aren't just reportedly calling it quits with their marriage, they are also done with politics months after the embarrassing election loss.","url":"https://radaronline.com/p/barack-michelle-obama-divorcing-done-politics-living-separate-bedrooms/","image":"https://media.radaronline.com/brand-img/Cx8IqObQD/0x0/obama-divorce-rumor-1-1744143130716.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-08 22:48:39","author":"Lauren McIver","authors":["Lauren McIver"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.179},{"id":309124564,"title":"Exclusive--Republican Sen.

Eli Crane (R-AZ), who has reintroduced a companion bill in the House after previously introducing it in the 118th Congress. \n\nThe legislation would end visa categories for extended, non-nuclear family members, limit sponsorship to immediate family only, reduce baseline caps on family-sponsored visas, and address special cases involving immigrants with parents in the U.S., the senator’s office stated.\n\n“The bill supports President Trump’s efforts to curb illegal immigration and ease pressure on the immigration system,” Banks’ office added.\n\nCrane told Breitbart News that “Unrestricted chain migration has allowed for the inexcusable exploitation and abuse of our immigration system.”\n\n“I’m proud to introduce this bill that will help restore the rule of law, prevent our nation from being overburdened, and bolster our national security,” the congressman continued. “I’m grateful to Sen. Jim Banks for leading this bill in the U.S. Senate, and I look forward to advancing this common sense legislation.”\n\nBanks’ latest move to combat mass migration comes soon after he introduced the End Unaccountable Amnesty Act in January to restore congressional oversight over immigration policies and tighten the requirements for the use of Temporary Protected Status (TPS), immigration parole, and the handling of unaccompanied alien children (UAC).\n\n“The Biden administration exploited current law to grant legal status to millions of non-citizens, overwhelming communities in Indiana and across the country,” Banks said at the time. “Our schools, healthcare systems, and public services are struggling with this massive influx.

Jeff Hurd explains his rare break with Trump over tariffs","text":"JEFF HURD, COLORADO’S ‘ACCIDENTAL POLITICIAN’ WHO IS TAKING OVER BOEBERT’S OLD HOUSE SEAT\n\nHurd, a lawyer, told the Washington Examiner in an interview that his decision to challenge Trump was a matter of following the Constitution. \n\n“I think most folks recognize the importance of this issue for us as an institution, for Congress, and the importance of Article 1, giving Congress this branch that legislative power, and the need to make sure that we look at that carefully and ensure that any exercise of authority by the executive branch is authorized by the legislative branch,” Hurd said on Tuesday. “That’s what the Constitution says, and I would say that regardless of who the president is.”\n\nThe Trade Review Act of 2025 is modeled after the War Powers Resolution of 1973, which gives Congress the ability to check the president’s power to wage war. Sens. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) and Chuck Grassley (R-IA) first introduced the legislation in the Senate and the White House said Trump would veto it.\n\nDespite the opposition from Trump and lacking support from House GOP leadership, Hurd and Bacon moved forward this week with their bipartisan bill and plan to win over more House GOP co-sponsors. \n\nHurd, who represents Colorado’s 3rd Congressional District, which was once held by Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-CO), was not included on the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee’s target list released Tuesday the after the Cook Political Report included his seat as “in play” but “likely Republican.” \n\n“One of the things I said when I was running for office was that my top two priorities were the Constitution of the United States and making sure that I take care of the 3rd Congressional District. And I think this legislation is consistent,” Hurd told the Washington Examiner.\n\nHurd noted he has heard from many constituents concerned about the tariffs — specifically from agriculture producers. \n\nBacon represents a highly targeted seat, with the Cook Political Report naming it the “toughest district on paper,” as former Vice President Kamala Harris won the greater Omaha area by almost 5 points. The Nebraska Republican remains on the DCCC’s target list and has won reelection since 2017 by appealing to Independent and Democratic voters.\n\n“This is less about the actual tariffs laid by the Trump Administration, some of which I support because they are reciprocal, but more a commitment to uphold the Constitution,” Bacon said in the press release. “Congress has the power of the purse.

CBS and Trump have agreed to a mediator in his $20 billion lawsuit against the network over a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris.\n\nMcFadden also said the White House could retain control over access restrictions for journalists, but it couldn’t extend such restrictions over an outlet’s “viewpoints”—something he said the White House has been “brazen” about restricting.\n\n“While the AP does not have a constitutional right to enter the Oval Office, it does have a right to not be excluded because of its viewpoint. And the AP says that is exactly what is happening,” he wrote. “The Court agrees.”\n\nTuesday’s ruling came less than two weeks after the outlet squared off in court against the White House over its months-long ban. The White House blocked the news wire from White House events, its controlled press pool, the Oval Office, and Air Force One over the outlet’s decision to use the “Gulf of Mexico” name.\n\nThe AP said it had to appeal to its global audience with the name, and it has reported on Trump’s executive order to change the name to the “Gulf of America.”\n\n“We are gratified by the court’s decision. Today’s ruling affirms the fundamental right of the press and public to speak freely without government retaliation,” AP spokeswoman Lauren Easton said. \n\n“This is a freedom guaranteed for all Americans in the U.S. Constitution. We look forward to continuing to provide factual, nonpartisan and independent coverage of the White House for billions of people around the world.”\n\n“The White House did not respond to an immediate request for comment.\n\nAt a hearing last month, the AP’s chief Washington photographer Evan Vucci told McFadden that the White House’s efforts were damaging its ability to competitively cover Trump and his administration. “We’re basically dead in the water on major news stories,” he said at the time.\n\nThe efforts have forced the organization to come up with creative ways of tackling an administration prone to retaliating against enemies, media or otherwise.\n\nIts reporters continue to reserve spots at White House events, though they are continuously turned away, according to The Washington Post. It has also relied on some of its foreign-based correspondents to filter into events as its White House-based team is excluded.\n\nIts photographers have had to stand apart from others as they try to capture Trump, leading to one widely circulated image of Trump reading the New York Post‘s coverage of his sweeping tariff plan from the inside of his presidential car, “The Beast.”\n\nIn its court arguments, the AP argued the White House has no process on how it determines which outlets get to cover Trump and arbitrarily excludes the AP from such lists. “There’s no rhyme or reason,” said Vucci, the reporter who took the famed photo of a defiant Trump raising his fist after last summer’s assassination attempt. “I don’t think anyone knows.”\n\nThe White House has argued that the AP has allowed its stylebook, which is used by most major news organizations worldwide for reference languages on topics, to be weaponized in biased ways. \n\nIt has allowed the AP, Wiles told AP executive editor Julie Pace in a letter in February, “to push a partisan worldview in contrast with the traditional and deeply held beliefs of many Americans and many people around the world.”","summary":"The Daily Beast/GettyThe Associated Press must have its full access to Donald Trump’s White House restored, a judge ruled on Tuesday.\n\nJudge Trevor McFadden, who was appointed by Trump to his position in 2017, ruled that the White House could not ban select journalists from events solely because of the viewpoints they express.

Some people in the industry do think this is Carrie's way of marking her territory as 'Miss Americana,' as her side of the political aisle won the election.\"\n\nBefore Trump dominated Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, Swift made it known she was endorsing the former vice president.While a feud between the two superstars might come as a surprise for many fans –American Idol viewers got a snippet of shade when Underwood said a lackluster contestant had a \"Taylor Swift-esque quality.\"\n\nThe site's insider said: \"It is understood that the disparaging comment did not go unnoticed. Carrie has been waiting for the moment to throw some subtle shade, but this was not that subtle.\n\n\"There was no reason to compare this girl to Taylor.\"A reason for the alleged feud between the two singers could be because of Swift's decision to switch from country to pop music years ago.\n\nSwift skyrocketed to fame after she released a handful of country songs one year after Underwood's American Idol win.\n\nThe Style singer was often referred to as the \"next Carrie Underwood\" – which possibly didn't sit well with the Before He Cheats singer.At one point, Underwood even addressed the feud rumors between the two during a radio appearance and said: \"I'm a little bit older than she is, and I feel like our music is completely different, and if anyone tries to make any comparisons, they really haven't listened to either one of us. \n\n\"She sings a little bit lighter sometimes, and it's just a difference in our brand of country.\"After taking jabs at Swift's romance with Robert F. Kennedy Jr's son Conor Kennedy and even her \"posse\" – the feud got too heated, and the singers even reportedly requested to be seated very far away from each other at the Grammy Awards in 2013.\n\nEven though the feud is mostly kept underwraps, the site's insider noted Underwood's fame, success and worth, which is estimated to be around $120 million, is nothing compared to Swift – who reportedly has a net worth of $1.6billion.","summary":"Carrie Underwood's \"insane\" plan to humiliate Taylor Swift has been exposed.","url":"https://radaronline.com/p/carrie-underwood-insane-plan-humiliate-taylor-swift-bizarre-feud-exposed/","image":"https://media.radaronline.com/brand-img/KZlhQLmgb/0x0/carrie-underwood-taylor-swift-feud-1-1744123059645.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-08 21:02:53","author":"Lauren McIver","authors":["Lauren McIver"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.181},{"id":309092904,"title":"Trump, CBS parent company set for mediation in $20 billion ’60 Minutes’ lawsuit","text":"CBS’ parent company, Paramount Global, and President Donald Trump are set to begin mediation in his $20 billion election interference lawsuit, Fox News Digital has confirmed. Trump is seeking $20 billion in a lawsuit against CBS, alleging election interference over its handling of a \"60 Minutes\" interview last year with Vice President Kamala Harris. The president has accused CBS of aiding his 2024 Democratic opponent through deceptive editing one month before they faced off in the presidential election. The saga began when Harris was widely mocked for a \"word salad\" answer she gave to \"60 Minutes\" correspondent Bill Whitaker during a preview of the interview on \"Face the Nation,\" and CBS then aired a different answer to the same question during a primetime special. The upcoming mediation, which was first reported by The New York Times, is designed to help the sides reach a settlement. TRUMP'S LAWSUIT AGAINST CBS EXPANDS AFTER RELEASE OF '60 MINUTES' TRANSCRIPT, ADDS PARAMOUNT AS DEFENDANT \"President Trump is committed to holding those who traffic in fake news, hoaxes, and lies to account. CBS and Paramount committed the worst kind of election interference and fraud in the closing days of the most important presidential election in history. President Trump will pursue this vital matter to its just and rightful conclusion,\" Ed Paltzik, attorney for President Trump, told Fox News Digital. CBS and Paramount Global did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Trump’s legal team previously requested \"all documents in CBS Interactive’s possession, custody, or control, wherever located, including documents in the possession of its representatives, attorneys, or other persons directly or indirectly retained by CBS Interactive, or anyone else acting on its behalf or otherwise subject to its control\" pertaining to the \"60 Minutes\" interview. The demand included all communications between CBS and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the Biden administration, the Harris campaign and the DNC from Sept. 22, 2024, through Feb. 11, 2025. CBS STAFFERS UPSET OVER ‘60 MINUTES’ DRAMA, ADMIT KAMALA HARRIS INTERVIEW EDITS WERE AN ‘UNFORCED ERROR’ Any communications pertaining to the lawsuit between CBS and Paramount employees have also been requested, along with any communications about advertising or commercials during the programs that aired the Harris interview. Critics accused CBS News of editing Harris' \"word salad\" answer to shield the former vice president from further backlash. Earlier this year, FCC Chair Brendan Carr ordered CBS News to hand over the unedited transcript as part of its investigation into whether the network violated the FCC's \"news distortion\" policy after a complaint was filed. CBS had refused to release the unedited transcript until the FCC got involved. TRUMP AMPS UP THE PRESSURE ON CBS WITH MASSIVE DISCOVERY DEMAND AS '60 MINUTES' LAWSUIT MOVES FORWARD The raw transcript and footage showed CBS News had aired only the first half of Harris' response to Whitaker's question about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu not \"listening\" to the Biden administration in a preview clip that aired on \"Face the Nation,\" but aired only the second half of her response during the primetime special. Trump's attorneys amended its lawsuit to include multiple excerpts from the unedited transcript in hopes of bolstering their case that CBS News withheld unflattering exchanges in order to help the Democratic nominee. CBS and its parent company, Paramount Global, have insisted the network did nothing wrong. Paramount Global is reportedly considering settling the suit ahead of a planned merger with Skydance Media in hopes of preventing potential retribution by Trump's FCC, which has the authority to halt the multibillion-dollar transaction.

Lindy Li, a well-known fundraiser who raised money for the Democrats' 2024 presidential campaign, announced her exit from the party in December after being ostracized for criticizing then-Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris. She was a loyal supporter of President Biden until she called for him to step aside because he was too old to serve a second term and believes she was gaslighted into initially believing Biden was sharp as a tack. Tapper was roasted online earlier this year when his upcoming book, \"Original Sin: President Biden’s Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again,\" was announced. The book, co-written by Axios journalist Alex Thompson, was attacked as hypocritical after critics unearthed a 2020 video of Tapper lecturing then-Trump 2020 campaign advisor Lara Trump for calling out Biden’s mental faculties. CNN'S JAKE TAPPER GETS RIPPED ON SOCIAL MEDIA FOR 'TRYING TO REWRITE HISTORY' WITH NEW BOOK ON BIDEN'S DECLINE Li appeared on \"The Rubin Report\" last week and host Dave Rubin questioned if people genuinely felt Biden was fit to serve another term or if they were simply \"in on the unsaid thing.\" Through much of 2024, Biden's cognitive issues were dismissed by Democrats and liberal media outlets as \"Sort of reminds me... Jake Tapper announced he has a book about the scandal around Biden’s health. It’s like, ‘Dude, you were running cover for it for three years while some of us were talking about it literally four or five years ago,’\" host Dave Rubin said. Li rolled her eyes as Rubin mentioned Tapper’s book, saying he \"pisses me off so much.\" In 2022, Tapper offered Biden a soft question about what he would say to Democratic voters who were concerned about his age and the job's demands. Tapper questioned White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre in 2023 about whether Biden was \"too old\" to be president and also pressed former Biden communications director Kate Bedingfield about the Robert Hur special counsel report last year that delved into Biden's memory lapses, but he took heat in a New York Post column after his book's announcement for not sufficiently sounding the alarm on Biden's decline until after the June debate he moderated. After the debate, Tapper spoke sharply about Biden's issues, even calling him \"not coherent\" at one point. Biden shortly after dropped out of the race and was replaced on the ticket by Kamala Harris. 'WOKE IS THEIR GOD': EX-DEM FUNDRAISER SAYS PARTY 'IN SHAMBLES' AFTER 2024 ELECTION LOSSES Li said she knew Biden \"in a private capacity,\" and didn’t see the CNN anchor around enough for him to have insight into his fitness for office behind-the-scenes. \"With Jake Tapper, he wasn’t in the room, and I’ve never seen him at any events, so all the intel from this book is second-hand,\" Li said. \"Let’s be honest what it was,\" she continued. \"It was an out-right lie that he was cognitively fit.\" Li said Tapper’s book \"is like a slap in the face to those of us who were punished for bringing it up.\" Li also claimed her appearances on CNN dried up once she publicly said Biden was too old to seek another term. \"I used to be on it all the time. I was a regular,\" she said, referring to CNN, not Tapper's program specifically. DNC GAVE EX-HARRIS BOOSTER 'NO CHOICE' BUT TO LEAVE, SHE SAYS, AS DEMS CRY TURNCOAT When asked for comment, CNN directed Fox News Digital to a representative for Tapper who is handling the book. \"Time and again, Jake raised concerns about President Biden’s mental stamina on his show, questioned Biden officials directly on air, and consistently encouraged open discussion and debate on the issue. Any claim that Jake sought to discourage these conversations is demonstrably false and contradicted by the clear record of his reporting,\" the representative for Tapper told Fox News Digital. \"Jake and Alex's book contains first-hand accounts of President Biden's state based on interviews with more than 200 people,\" the representative continued. \"Stay tuned for what they discovered.\" Li previously said her decision to leave the party \"wasn't easy\" but was the \"result of a decade-long progression.\" \"It took a while for me to get here over the course of the past year. I just realized that the values of the Democratic Party are so incongruous to mine,\" Li said. \"It just contradicts everything I believe, everything from open borders to woke and DEI insanity. It's just not my party anymore.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Fox News Digital’s Gabriel Hays and Aubrie Spady contributed to this report.","summary":"Lindy Li blasted CNN’s Jake Tapper’s upcoming book as &quot;a slap in the face&quot; to people who were scolded for questioning former President Biden’s fitness for office.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/jake-tappers-book-is-a-slap-in-the-face-to-anyone-who-questioned-bidens-fitness-for-office-lindy-li-says","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/04/931/523/jake-tapper-lindy-li.png?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-08 20:00:44","author":"Brian Flood","authors":["Brian Flood"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.014},{"id":309086858,"title":"John Stamos defends hosting charity event at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago","text":"John Stamos is addressing his appearance at a charity event held at U.S. President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort on April 5, after he received backlash from fans.\n\nThe 61-year-old actor spoke out after people online criticized him for his attendance at the Palm Beach Ray of Hope Gala, letting his fans know that the move was not “political.”\n\n“I accepted the invitation to emcee the Palm Beach Ray of Hope Gala — an evening dedicated to honoring and uplifting our frontline heroes,” the Full House alum wrote on his Instagram Stories on April 7.\n\n“This nonpartisan even supports The Academy for Nursing and Health Occupations, a 501(c)(3) organization that trains 350-400 nurses every year, directly addressing the critical shortage of healthcare professionals in Palm Beach County.”\n\n“Supporting nurses isn’t political — it’s essential.

Jewish Americans, however, have been mostly unconvinced, voting overwhelmingly for Democrat Kamala Harris in 2024, keeping with decades of precedent for liberal candidates. Nevertheless, just days into his second term, Trump signed an executive order to \"combat antisemitism,\" focusing largely on the campus-roiling protests against Israel's war on the Gaza Strip.\n\nSince then, the Trump administration has targeted several international students for deportation, ostensibly over their roles in the recent protests. At the same time, allegations of permitting antisemitism to flourish on campus have been the purported basis for the White House's push to defund Ivy League schools like Columbia and Brown University. But as the White House touts its efforts, a growing number of Jewish Americans have begun speaking out about what they claim is the exploitation of their identities for the president's personal agenda.\n'Uncomfortable' spotlight\n\nThe Trump administration has been \"using 'antisemitism' as a pretext to advance a radical agenda,\" said Yair Rosenberg at The Atlantic. That agenda has \"nothing to do with Jews at all\" and is one that \"most American Jews do not support.\" In the case of \"detentions and deportations,\" for instance, while a \"handful of high-profile cases\" purport to be predicated on the subject's alleged antisemitic actions, \"most of them do not.\" In so much as there have been instances of actual antisemitism on campuses, Trump has not \"surgically targeted these failings at America's universities for rectification,\" said Rosenberg.

The result, whether intended or not, is a \"spotlight on Jews that makes many uncomfortable.\"\n\nSome Jewish communal groups that have previously backed the Trump administration are beginning to speak out about their discomfort with the White House's tactics claiming to help protect Jews. After initially lauding Trump for the detention of Columbia University student and Gaza war protester Mahmoud Khalil, Anti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt made \"something of a shift\" recently by gently critiquing the White House in the days that followed, said Jewish Insider. Protecting Jewish students \"shouldn't require us to shred the norms that we use to protect other people,\" said Greenblatt in an interview with the publication.\n\nTrump may have \"couched\" his \"aggressive moves\" against universities like Columbia and Princeton as a \"means of protecting Jewish students,\" said the Forward. At the same time, however, he has shuttered the Department of Education, which is the governmental body with the \"most responsibility for investigating antisemitism.\"\n'Weaponizing' real pain\nThere is a \"disdain for the exploitation of real concerns about antisemitism\" on campuses when it's used to \"fuel a broader crackdown on liberal education,\" said Jewish Studies Professor Joel Swanson at Slate. Students see a \"pretext of fighting antisemitism\" being used to \"destroy the foundations of the liberal arts education.\" This, in turn, has a chilling effect on those wanting to speak out about \"legitimate concerns about antisemitism on campus.\"\nTrump is \"weaponizing the real pain American Jews face,\" said Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), and he is using that pain as a tool in his \"desire to wield control over the truth-seeking academic institutions that stand as a bulwark against authoritarianism.\" Search for a moment in history where Jews have \"benefited from a mix of rampant nationalism and repression, said Matt Bai at The Washington Post, in a critique of Greenblatt's previous support for the Trump administration published two days before the Jewish Insider interview. \"You'll be looking awhile.\"\n\nExplore More\n\nDonald Trump\nantisemitism\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox\nA free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nRafi Schwartz, The Week US\n\nSocial Links Navigation\n\nRafi Schwartz has worked as a politics writer at The Week since 2022, where he covers elections, Congress and the White House.

Why did he run for reelection knowing that he would have been 82 when he started his second term, and 86 when it ended? \n\nIn his new book, Uncharted: How Trump Beat Biden, Harris, and the Odds in the Wildest Campaign in History, author Chris Whipple argues that Biden's family and closest advisers operated in a \"fog of delusion and denial\" with regard to his ability to serve another term. \n\nWhipple had his own reasons for wondering if the Biden staff was shielding the president from scrutiny. He notes that when he was working an earlier book, which detailed the first two years of the Biden administration, Whipple asked for an interview with the president and was told he could email questions and receive written answers in reply. \n\n\"Clearly, they were uncomfortable even then with the prospect of the president having an interview in real time with a reporter,\" Whipple says. \"So there's no doubt that they were protecting the president, they were minimizing his contact with others.\"\n\nAs the 2024 campaign kicked into gear, the president couldn't hide from public scrutiny, Whipple says. He notes that in the days leading up to his disastrous debate with President Trump, Biden \"was in a terrible state.\"\n\n\"He was absolutely exhausted. He was unable really to follow what was happening in the campaign. He was tuned out,\" Whipple says. \"Early on, he walked out of a [debate preparation] session in the Aspen Lodge, the president's cabin, went over to the pool, sank into a lounge chair, and just fell sound asleep.\"\n\nThe debate marked a turning point in the Biden reelection campaign — less than a month later, Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed then-Vice President Kamala Harris. Harris would later lose the general election to President Trump. \n\nWhipple sees parallels between the twists and turns of Biden's reelection campaign and a Shakespearean tragedy. \n\n\"I think that it's unquestionable that there was just an abdication of leadership starting within that inner circle,\" he says. \"The inability of any of those [staffers] to sit the president down and say, 'Look, you need to look at this clear eyed and realize that you're going to be 86 years old and you're not up to this and everybody knows it.' That never happened.\"\n\nInterview highlights\n\nOn why Biden's staffers believed he could still govern\n\nI think that this is much more interesting and not nearly as simple as the notion of a cover-up. In other words, I am convinced that Joe Biden's inner circle was convinced that Joe Biden was capable of governing, and they believed that he could do it for another four years. And we can't dismiss the fact that Biden on the very last day, July 21st, that Sunday when his aides came to hammer out his abdication statement, Joe Biden was on the phone parsing the details of a complex multi-nation prisoner swap. He was on top of every detail. \n\nPeople who visited Biden in the Oval Office to talk about the Middle East said he was on top of every nuance of Middle Eastern policy. ... Joe Biden, behind closed doors, was governing, capably, whether you liked his policies or not. So there's no question that he was a shadow of the campaigner that he once was, and that was true from 2020 all the way to the end. But, you can't dismiss the fact — it's an inconvenient fact for people who say it was a cover-up — that Biden was capable.\n\n On Biden and Obama's relationship\n\nThe whole relationship between Joe Biden and Barack Obama is so complex and fascinating and with so many levels to it. I mean, on the one hand, there's no question about the fact that they really bonded over Bo Biden's tragic death. And Barack Obama took Joe Biden under his wing, and they developed a closeness there. But at the same time, there's a real competitiveness between them. And the Obama camp, for example, was not amused when Biden's staffers were going around early in his first term and talking about how the American Rescue Plan was so much bigger than Obama's stimulus package back in 2009. They're just competitive, these two camps. The other major factor here is that Joe Biden never forgave Barack Obama for putting his thumb on the scale for Hillary Clinton to become the nominee in 2016. That was a really deep wound for Joe Biden.\n\nAnd in the end, it became clear that as during that fateful weekend of July 20-21, that Barack Obama wasn't really there. He just wasn't there for Joe Biden. One of Biden's closest friends told me that the thing that really got him was that Obama never picked up the phone and called him and just said, \"You know Joe, geez, are you sure you're up to this?\" That never happened. There was a phone call earlier after the debate saying, \"Hey, it was just a bad night. Don't worry about it.\" But when things went south and Biden was on the ropes, Barack Obama never picked up the phone.\n\nOn Kamala Harris putting together a \"stealth campaign\" before Biden officially dropped out\n\nPrior to that weekend when Biden made his decision, up to that point, Harris had had to be absolutely scrupulous. She was walking through a minefield. I mean, she had to be so careful not to give any hint that she was thinking about taking over the top spot on the ticket. But the truth was that she was quietly and secretly preparing. Her camp had reached out to Democratic political operatives who were looking at the rules and getting ready and making sure that if that day came, when that day came, I think they thought that she would be ready to go. And sure enough, she was. But not only were those operatives looking at the rules and figuring out how she could grasp the nomination, they were also putting out the word to some senators that they needed to come out in favor of Joe Biden stepping aside. And so there was a campaign, a stealth campaign going on prior to that Sunday.\n\nOn Harris' inability to differentiate herself from Biden\n\nShe had to be prepared for the $64,000 question, which they knew was coming, and that was: What would you do differently from Joe Biden? And when that day came, when Kamala Harris was appearing on the ABC program, The View, it was a disaster. She fumbled the answer. … Inexplicably, she said, \"Well, I can't think of a single thing,\" was how she began the answer. That was immediately turned into a campaign commercial by the Trump team, which was devastating. And that was a real turning point of the campaign. … She was prepared, but she couldn't answer the question. and I think the reason is that fundamentally Kamala Harris was loyal to Joe Biden.\n\nOne of the ironies here is that her top campaign officials, Jen O'Malley-Dillon and Lorraine Voles, had gone to the White House and specifically sat down with Jeff Zients, Joe Biden's chief of staff, and in effect asked for permission to separate themselves from Biden. And Zients told them, go for it. Do whatever you have to do. Not only that, Joe Biden personally called Kamala Harris and said, look, I get it. You need to win this campaign and don't worry about hurting my feelings, in effect, not in those words. It's fascinating to me that even then she was unable to make that break.\n\nSam Briger and Anna Bauman produced and edited this interview for broadcast.

He doesn't like our laws, he does not like our Constitution,\" Carville began. \"He doesn’t like our people. He calls them fat. He calls them poorly educated, slobs, stupid. And he is in the midst of what I believe —I've said, and yet, continue to believe even stronger every day — we're in the midst of a collapse.\" Carville referenced the stock market turmoil and the protests against Elon Musk before continuing: \"What I think is — if he sees himself going down, he's going to try to take the whole country with him,\" Carville said of Trump. \"He is not loyal to the United States of America. He does not like this country. He criticizes it all the time. He has affection for dictators. He has an affection for authoritarianism.\" \"And you're so correct to be concerned about this,\" he assured his viewers. \"And it's getting worse by the day. It is not going to stop getting worse.

I'm not saying that, but I'm saying that that did happen,\" Carville said about the historical comparison. The strategist said he wasn't endorsing this treatment but said it could happen to Trump cooperators, who, he added, have betrayed America. \"But I’m saying that that did happen. And I’m saying that these people betrayed the French nation in the same way that I think that these law firms and these giant corporate conglomerates are betraying the United States,\" he declared, though he added he doesn’t know what their \"comeuppance\" should be and advised people not to assault anyone. ‘HANDS OFF’ PROTESTS ACROSS COUNTRY PROTEST SECOND TRUMP ADMINISTRATION CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Fox News' Gabriel Hays contributed to this report.","summary":"James Carville suggested Americans be on &quot;high alert&quot; after listeners to his podcast asked if President Donald Trump would try to interfere in the 2026 midterms.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/james-carville-warns-country-high-alert-asked-trump-might-try-rig-midterms","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/04/931/523/split.png?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-08 18:37:24","author":"Kristine Parks","authors":["Kristine Parks"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.416},{"id":309065758,"title":"After ‘Hands Off’ protest, massive nationwide anti-Trump demonstrations planned for April 19 across all 50 states; here who's organizing them and what you need to know","text":"Following the massive turnout for the Hands Off! protests on April 5, the grassroots group 50501 is preparing for another nationwide demonstration.

Wall Street suffered its third consecutive losing day on Monday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling nearly 350 points.Global markets also have plunged, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropping more than 13%, Japan's Nikkei down nearly 8%, and Europe's DAX tumbling a staggering 10%, all amid fallout from Trump's aggressive tariff blitz and escalating trade war with China.The irony hasn't gone unnoticed. \"Every accusation is an admission,\" one user on X theorized.During the campaign, Trump repeatedly linked Democratic leadership to economic doom, calling Harris' policies \"a nightmare\" and blaming the Biden administration for an increased cost of living. He promised sweeping tax cuts—including the elimination of taxes on tips, overtime, and Social Security benefits—along with historic economic gains under his leadership.But as the world digests the fallout from Trump's unilateral tariffs, economists now warn that his policies could spark the very recession he warned against. Since last week's announcement of global tariff hikes, trillions have been wiped off global markets and economists are scrambling to predict the potential impact of rising prices, investor panic, and international backlash.Trump has defended the chaos as necessary medicine. \"Sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something,\" he told reporters.Another recirculated video from 2024 features Trump alluding to a potential economic crash, stating that he hopes it happens during Biden's presidency, and not his second term.The stock market turmoil seemingly conflicts with Trump's previous hopes for his presidency, but as one social media user pointed out sarcastically: \"He did keep his word on that crashed market.\"Originally published on Latin Times","summary":"Campaign trail clips of Trump warning of an economic crash if Kamala Harris is elected are circulating on social media amid a massive stock selloff triggered by tariffs.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com/trump-warned-kamala-economic-crash-resurfaced-campaign-clips-tariffs-tank-market-every-3769125","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4592235/trump-warned-kamala-economic-crash-resurfaced-campaign.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-08 18:14:05","author":"Morgan Music","authors":["Morgan Music"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.056},{"id":309058048,"title":"Republicans Dealt Blow in Key Senate Race as Chris Sununu Declines to Run","text":"Former New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu said he is not running for Senate in the Granite State, dealing a blow to Republicans who viewed him as their best bet to flip the seat being vacated by retiring Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen.Why It MattersNew Hampshire is a competitive state that has leaned toward Democrats in recent federal elections, though it continues to back Republicans in gubernatorial races. Republicans were hopeful that Sununu, who remains popular in the state, would jump into the Senate race to give them a better chance at victory in the midterms next November.While the race remains more than a year away, limited polling of the state suggested Sununu would have been a stronger nominee than other prospective GOP candidates in what already may be a difficult year for Republicans, as the party of the president in power typically loses seats in the midterms.What to KnowSununu confirmed his decision not to run in comments to local televison news station WMUR.\"I've done eight years, and it was a hard eight years as governor. To sign up for the Senate, you're really signing up for 12 more years, so that's a commitment I hadn't really put into the mix, and, again, it's just not right for my family at this time,\" he said.The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee celebrated the news, describing it as an \"embarrassing recruitment failure for Republicans embarrassing recruitment failure for Republicans.\"Nick Puglia, press secretary for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, however, told Newsweek that Republicans remain optimistic about the race.\"The NRSC continues to believe Republicans are going to win New Hampshire in 2026,\" he said. \"While Democrats duke it out in a race to the left, we are excited about the number of candidates we are talking to who appreciate the privilege of representing Granite Staters in the Senate and are ready to build winning campaigns.\"On the Democratic side, Representative Chris Pappas announced his bid last week. He represents New Hampshire's First Congressional District, the more competitive of its two districts, which stretches from the White Mountains to the Seacoast Region to Manchester.New Hampshire is viewed as a competitive state, with Vice President Kamala Harris winning it by less than 3 percentage points last November. At the same time, Republican Kelly Ayotte, then a former senator, won the gubernatorial race by more than 9 points.There have been limited polls on the race, but a NHJournal/Praecones Analytica poll released in March showed Sununu in a stronger position against Shaheen, who has since announced her retirement, than other potential candidates.Sununu led Shaheen by about 9 points, but Shaheen held a 10-point lead over former Massachusetts Senator Scott Brown and a 17-point lead over Commissioner of Education Frank Edelblut.That poll surveyed 626 registered voters from February 26 to March 1, 2025.A Quantas Insights poll, which surveyed 650 registered voters from March 17 to March 19, 2025, showed Sununu with a 9-point lead over Pappas (53 percent to 44 percent). No other polls have been conducted with Pappas as the Democratic candidate.President Donald Trump over the weekend said he would have been supportive of a Sununu run.\"I support him fully. I hope he runs. He's been very nice to me over the last year or so. I hope he runs. I think he'd win that seat,\" Trump told reporters.In some key races like New Hampshire and Michigan, Democratic senators have retired rather than run for another term, raising questions about whether they could become more competitive next year without a well-known incumbent on the ticket.Ayotte was the last Republican to win a New Hampshire Senate race in 2010, but she was defeated by Democrat Maggie Hassan, then the state's former governor, in 2016.What People Are SayingBrown on X (formerly Twitter): \"@ChrisSununu and the entire Sununu family are patriots who have made our state a better place - looking forward to seeing what's next for him and working alongside him for New Hampshire's future.\"Decision Desk data analyst Michael Pruser on X: \"Former Republican NH governor Chris Sununu declines a run for US Senate in 2026. This clears up doubts about Democrats' ability to hold the seat next November. With Pappas declaring his candidacy, the race swings firmly into the 'Likely Democratic' category.\"Colin Booth, New Hampshire political correspondent for Courier Newsroom, on X: \"Sununu is OUT for a 2026 Senate run, dramatically raising the likelihood of Democrats holding both New Hampshire senate seats.\"What Happens NextBrown, who lost to Shaheen in the 2014 Senate race, has been floated as a potential Republican candidate. It's not clear if other Democrats will jump into the primary against Pappas.

Musk spent at least $3 million on the race, which became the most expensive U.S. court race in history. The GOP-backed candidate lost, which led Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN), the failed 2024 vice presidential candidate, to declare that “the oligarchs lost” in the Democratic Party’s victory lap.\n\nLook on the other side of that election spending, though, and you will see the Democratic Party’s own oligarchs came out to play as well. Billionaire George Soros and Gov. JB Pritzker (D-IL) combined to spend $3.5 million on the race. Pritzker is the wealthiest politician in the country and the “heir to the Hyatt Hotel fortune,” with an estimated net worth of $3.5 billion. Pritzker spent a combined $323 million on his two runs for governor. He even boasted at the 2024 Democratic National Convention of being an “actual billionaire” compared to Trump and has tried to position himself as a national leader in the party and a presidential candidate.\n\nPritzker’s spending doesn’t compare to the scope of Soros’s over the years. Soros may have been the most destructive spending force in politics over the past decade, funneling millions of dollars into local district attorney elections to try and alter the criminal justice system fundamentally. Left-wing Politico in 2016 called Soros’s spending a “quiet overhaul of the U.S. justice system.” Left-wing New York Magazine made sure to let everyone know that Democrats should be supportive of this particular oligarch, writing that same year that “Soros is Buying America a Less Racist Justice System.”\n\nSoros spent at least $40 million to get about 70 “prosecutors” elected. Those candidates were glorified defense attorneys who adhered to Soros’s pro-criminal worldview that criminals are victims of a racist justice system and that they should be kept out of prison at all costs. Soros’s funding made up 90% of campaign funding for some of those candidates, who were flush with cash compared to the real prosecutors against whom they were running.\n\nSoros’s spending wasn’t limited to district attorney races, either. As Gabe Kaminsky wrote for the Washington Examiner, “Soros’s Open Society Foundations is a sprawling grantmaking network that disburses over $1 billion to left-wing causes as its founder bankrolls the Democratic Party.” Soros was the largest donor of the 2022 midterm elections, spending $120 million to get various Democrats elected.\n\nAfter that, the now 94-year-old Soros passed control of his political operation to his son, Alex. The 39-year-old described himself as “more political” than his father and, in 2024, upped the spending to the Senate Majority PAC, House Majority PAC, and Future Forward PAC (the largest super PAC in the cycle, which was focused on backing then-Vice President Kamala Harris). Alex Soros made about 25 visits to the Biden White House from October 2021 to May 2024, and he met with prominent Democrats, including Walz, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, and then-Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.\n\nIn addition to the pro-crime district attorneys and the influence over Democratic politicians, the Soros family has contributed to the racial divisions promoted by left-wing narratives. The Soros contribution list includes Black PAC, Black Voters Matter Action PAC, Black Men Vote PAC, Color of Change PAC, and AAPI Victory Fund. That is another thing worth remembering when Democrats claim that Musk is some kind of divisive oligarchic figure.\n\nThen, there is Pierre Omidyar, the founder of eBay and another of the Democratic Party’s major “oligarchs.” Omidyar has been funding several progressive groups that are pushing corporate boycotts against Musk’s companies. Omidyar’s Democracy Fund has funneled millions to groups associated with Marc Elias, the Democratic election lawyer who tries to use the legal system to overturn fair elections that Democrats lose, including most recently, the 2024 U.S. Senate election in Pennsylvania. Democracy Fund is also helping fund the new Governors Safeguarding Democracy, co-chaired by Pritzker.\n\nOmidyar has also contributed funding to liberal “disinformation” efforts designed to undermine and deplatform conservative media outlets, including the “Trust Project” and the Global Disinformation Index, the latter of which blacklisted the Washington Examiner, among other outlets, to advertisers.\n\nWhile Musk’s political ventures are out in the open for all to see, Democratic megadonors benefit from the liberal dark money system that has been built up for decades. “Dark money” is another of the talking points that Democrats are hypocrites on, with federal records showing Harris was backed by dark money groups eight times more than Trump was in 2024. Senate Majority PAC, aligned with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), raked in $81 million from 2021 to 2023 from dark money nonprofit Majority Forward.\n\nWhat Musk has in money he lacks in the experience of the Democratic Party’s oligarchs, who have ingrained themselves into the party’s activist infrastructure and whose influence reaches from the top of the party all the way down to local elections, as the Soros family has proven. None of this even accounts for the party’s other wealthy narrative setters. That includes the university bureaucrats and presidents making six or seven figures whose takeover of higher education is only now being addressed by Republicans, and the millionaire Hollywood celebrities who used their cultural (and financial) influence in the party to get themselves carve-outs from California’s COVID and environmental restrictions.\n\nAnd let’s not forget public sector unions that control the Democratic Party in states like California, Illinois, and New Jersey. These union leaders make hundreds of thousands of dollars a year while ruling over vast fiefdoms financed by taxpayer dollars. They control not just the pay and hiring of most government workers but also set policies in areas such as education, transportation, and energy. Voters trapped in these Democratic Party jurisdictions have no voice in how government unions run their monopolies. Their only recourse is to pick up stakes and move out of the state entirely. And many are doing exactly that.\n\nSOROS-FUNDED GROUPS WAGE LEGAL BATTLE ON DOGE\n\nThe Democratic Party’s oligarchs aren’t going away any time soon, either. If Alex Soros is anything like his father, he will be around for another 50 or more years, and he has already cemented himself as a key figure among today’s Democratic politicians. Pritzker has tried to insert himself in national politics, likely to set himself up to run for president in 2028 or beyond. They have a track record far longer than Musk with much more success, given Musk’s grand efforts in the Wisconsin Supreme Court race couldn’t secure a win. George Soros altering the criminal justice system in about 70 American cities seems to be a case of an oligarch having far more control over American politics than Musk’s electoral efforts.\n\nAs is the case with most things, Democrats do not have a problem with “oligarchs,” only with oligarchs who do not help push their agenda forward. The Democratic Party’s messaging, as always, requires you to forget that it is as guilty of the very thing it is accusing Republicans of and has been guilty of it for far longer.","summary":"The Democratic Party has chosen “oligarchy” as its new talking point against the GOP.

This executive says he’s built a winning formula","text":"By Ryan Faughnder, Los Angeles Times\n\nLOS ANGELES — Chris McGurk saw the writing on the wall for the independent film business more than a decade ago.\n\nHis distribution company Cinedigm released “Short Term 12,” starring Brie Larson, to rave reviews in 2013. Hardly anyone showed up to see it in theaters.\n\n“We probably lost $4 million on it,” McGurk told the Times. “At that point, I said, we gotta stop doing this. Let’s see if we can build a new machine.”\n\nSo the firm pivoted its focus, spending years assembling and growing its collection of “new media” assets — streaming channels, a podcast network and its own ad technology.\n\nIt used those online channels, social media and its horror fan site Bloody Disgusting to wage a microbudget campaign for Damien Leone‘s gory underground killer-clown horror sequel “Terrifier 2” in 2022, grossing nearly $11 million at the domestic box office.\n\nLast year’s follow-up, “Terrifier 3,” did even better for the Los Angeles-based company, now called Cineverse: $54 million in North American ticket sales and $90 million worldwide.\n\nNow the company is trying to fill its release slate with similar intellectual-property-driven movies that can leverage that same system, including a Legendary-produced revival of the Troma cult classic “The Toxic Avenger,” starring Peter Dinklage (set for Aug. 29).\n\nCineverse’s success comes at a time when many people believe the traditional way of releasing movies — with broad-based, expensive national ad campaigns — is broken for some types of movies. Certain films still do good business, including big action spectacles, low-cost horror pictures and animated movies. But indie releases and mid-budget films are increasingly risky.\n\nWith that in mind, I spoke to McGurk, who joined the company in 2011 after stints at Overture Films and MGM, about why his model is well suited to the digital age and what Hollywood might be able to learn from it.\n\nQ: How does your business model allow you to lean further into theatrical releases at this perilous time?\n\nA: The all-in investment for “Terrifier 3” was less than $5 million in acquisition costs and marketing spend. If you take the theatrical marketing costs out of the mix, it fundamentally changes the economics, not just for us but for producers and filmmakers.\n\nQ: This is something that non-Hollywood people don’t understand. Often, for smaller movies, the marketing spend is a much bigger cost than making the film.\n\nA: If you read a recent interview with Tom Quinn, CEO of Neon, that’s exactly what he said. They spent $18 million on “Anora,” and it was a $6 million movie. In our case, the producers were sitting behind a less-than-$5-million investment on our part, and they’re pretty happy right now.\n\nWe’ve already added three movies to our release schedule. One is “The Toxic Avenger,” which Legendary produced and we picked up. Our all-in investment in that will be less than $5 million.\n\nQ: And $5 million is low for a Legendary Pictures movie.\n\nA: It was originally rated R, but we put some stuff back in it, and now we’re going to take it out unrated, just like we did with “Terrifier,” because we think there’s a fan base out there that basically is saying “screw it” to all the rules and regulations and the MPA [Motion Picture Association]. They want to see a raw, uncut movie.\n\nThe movie was in the can in 2023 and it went to Fantastic Fest and got great reviews, but the studios couldn’t figure out how to release it. So part of our campaign is, “We’re giving you the movie that the big studios didn’t want released or couldn’t release.” And we’ll go right after the “Terrifier” audience, even though this isn’t exactly a straight horror movie.\n\nIt’s a Troma movie.\n\nQ: That’s really the only way to describe it.\n\nA: We also have “Silent Night, Deadly Night,” which is a remake of the movie in the ’80s that they banned from theaters. And then we also announced “Wolf Creek: Legacy,” the third in that series.\n\nThe goal is to maybe get up to as many as eight wide releases a year. I know it’s kind of counter to what everybody else is doing, but we’re going to keep applying our formula until it doesn’t work.\n\nQ: And that formula is what?\n\nA: It’s really saying, we’ve got this collection of new-media assets that we own and control, so how can we leverage that in order to drive media value and awareness?\n\nWe think on “Terrifier 3” we probably created $5 million to $7 million in media value without spending a dime beyond the cost of producing the ads, which isn’t that much.\n\nQ: You’re able to do this because you are small by design, compared to the studio players.\n\nA: And I think we’re willing to throw out all the rules and leverage these assets. We’re not going through a middleman.\n\nIf you’re the head of marketing at a studio, your new spending plan is to do everything you did before, but do a little less of it.\n\nQ: Studios often won’t do mid-budget movies because they’re so challenging financially. Are there ways to be smarter about marketing those films?\n\nA: I think we’re onto something.\n\nI hate to make the comparison, but it’s analogous to how Trump won. He went with the podcasts and very targeted spending, TikTok and digital spending and things like that. Whereas Kamala Harris followed more of a national media buying approach but lost.\n\nThe problem is, every executive in that business is trying not to screw up. So it really does stifle innovation and risk-taking.\n\nQ: How do you target the marketing for “The Toxic Avenger?”\n\nA: We’re going to use our own ad technology to identify where the fan base is for this type of movie — the Troma fans. And we’re going to place ads to target that audience and market it on our podcast network as well.\n\nThe other thing that we’ve had real success in doing is creating stunts and promos that have attracted a lot of attention.\n\nFor “Terrifier 3,” we had a guy dressed up as Art the Clown walking through Times Square the week before our movie opening, and looking up at a billboard of the Joker. For “Toxic Avenger,” we did a stunt where they dyed the Chicago River green for St. Patrick’s Day and we had Toxie on a boat with his mop going around to clean it up.\n\nQ: You’ve got the Troma geeks, but you’ve also got Macon Blair directing, who has a following.\n\nA: With “Terrifier 3,” our whole thing was, how do we expand the audience beyond the people who went to see “Terrifier 2”? So we spent a lot of time really focusing on the Hispanic audience and the African American audience, and almost half the viewers on opening weekend were Hispanic.\n\nThen it was trying to figure out how we could have group attendance and increase our female attendance. And we did that in two ways.\n\nOne was, we tried to make Art the Clown this must-see character and not focus on the gore. Sort of what we did with “Hannibal” back at MGM, where we sold Hannibal Lecter as the James Bond of serial killers. And then toward the end, we really did the whole “You’ve got to see this movie, because everybody’s going to be talking about it.”\n\nSo we need to do that here. We need to make sure that Troma fans go to see the movie. But we need to expand out of that and focus on the comedy and the actors to try to get more of a female audience and more group attendance.\n\nQ: That’s key to the decision to go unrated, right? You’re going for a “You really shouldn’t be seeing this” kind of appeal.\n\nA: The studios can’t really release an unrated movie, because they’re signatories to MPA. It gives us a real advantage, because we really don’t care.\n\nQ: There’s a space for filmmakers to do things outside the traditional system.\n\nA: The thing is, we didn’t have final cut on the “Terrifier” films, and we were fine with that. Let him make his movie. That’s our approach.\n\nWhen I was at MGM, I was trying to get Christopher Nolan to do [James] Bond, and the Bond producers would not give him final cut. Now he’s Christopher Nolan times five.\n\nQ: Well, now they’ll have another chance with producers Amy Pascal and David Heyman in charge of 007 for Amazon.\n\nA: He’ll get final cut now, but it’s 20 years too late, in my view.\n\nQ: Anything to add?\n\nA: Just one important point. I hated how everybody on Wall Street and in the entertainment press set up this big thing of “streaming versus theatrical,” with streaming being the villain, because it was helping to destroy this great institution in America.\n\nWhat we tried to do with the “Terrifier” movies is show that there could be a symbiotic relationship between the two. We use streaming and the podcasts to basically help make a theatrical success in a unique and different way, and hopefully everybody can do more of that.\n\n©2025 Los Angeles Times.

I Did, Too—but It’s Not What I Imagined.","text":"Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nI like to tell people I moved abroad for a dog. I came to Amsterdam for the first time in December 2022 to dog-sit an adorable Maltipoo named Pretzel. I fell in love with the city: amazed at how smooth public transit was, obsessed with the efficiency and how things “just worked,” and in awe of how international it was. I spent those first three weeks pretending I lived there. And when I returned in the fall of 2023 to watch Pretzel again, the feeling nagged at me that maybe I could.\n\nWith my German passport, I didn’t need to get a visa. As a freelancer, my work was both remote and flexible. And I wanted to experience something different. Save for college, I had lived in D.C. for my entire life. Truth be told, I was sick of living in a city that revolved around politics, constantly being asked, “What do you do?” as if it were a badge of honor. And yes, while I know I could have moved somewhere else (anywhere else) stateside, I was keen for an adventure and a new way of life.\n\nSo, in February of 2024, I hopped on a plane to Amsterdam to try out living there for real. There were a lot of factors that determined whether and how long I would stay: if I could find housing (I got extremely lucky), if I could withstand the rain (you get used to it), and if working a nocturnal lifestyle was sustainable (as a night owl, I actually prefer it). But as the months moved on and I started to really build a life for myself, there was one thing that kept me from officially settling in: how the election would go.\n\nIf Kamala Harris won, I knew I would be enticed to go back to the U.S. In my mind, her election would allow us to get back on track as a country. Not to mention, I wouldn’t have to live in constant fear of an erratic president who would make my job a lot more fast-paced and depressing.\n\nBut if she lost … I wasn’t sure. I had lived through one Trump presidency already, and I couldn’t help but worry about how much worse it could be this time around. Why would I return to such chaos when my life in Amsterdam was, for the most part, so stress-free?\n\nWhen the election happened, I was devastated—and resolved. A decision had been made for me: I would stay in Amsterdam for another year, if not more. (“I think we lost Hannah,” my grandma likes to say.) But it felt like a shock, the realization that more than half of my country was willing to let a convicted felon be in a position of power again.\n\nThis worsened around and after the inauguration. By then, I’d come to terms with the fact that I wasn’t moving back anytime soon. But even knowing that, I still felt like I was between two places. For one, my job as a homepage editor at Slate certainly requires me to be aptly tuned in to what’s unfolding in America (many of my American friends, understandably, try to avoid the news). Being an ocean away, I know most of the policies won’t affect me directly. But it really hit close to home, literally. Or at least, what had once been home.\n\nI grew up in D.C., and my mom works as an environmental lawyer for the federal government. From a young age, I knew about government shutdowns—though I was disappointed to learn they didn’t mean school was canceled too. I went to high school downtown, just a few blocks from the White House. I knew all about how Congress works: how our city is unfairly treated in decision-making and taxed without adequate representation.\n\nNow, watching everything essentially get flushed down the toilet is upsetting, even from thousands of miles away. I know so many people who have devoted their lives to civil service, oftentimes committing to mundane tasks that make sure our government functions correctly. They know how to navigate the bureaucratic BS that keeps—or maybe, kept—our country running.\n\nHere, people treat America as a circus. So many of my European friends send memes poking fun at us. I get it because I joke about it too, but what I’ve realized in the past few months is that I may not consider myself a patriot, but I still care about my country’s descent into chaos.\n\nIt also feels wrong to be catastrophizing America when things aren’t so perfect here either. In the Netherlands—and many places in Europe—there’s a general shift to conservativism too. There are also refugees from Ukraine, who are here because they don’t really have a country to go back to. When I meet them, I feel the guilt of knowing I could go back, but they don’t have a choice.\n\nAnd then there’s the weird tension of why I can be here in the first place: My grandfather was born in Hamburg. He and his family left on his birthday, Aug. 5, 1938, just three months before the Nazis ransacked Jewish homes as part of Kristallnacht. My German passport is a reparation of sorts, allowing me to live my life here because he couldn’t.\n\nI wish I could be like some of the expats I meet who no longer care about the U.S. and are OK with it burning itself to the ground. But for me, it feels hard to fathom a world without America—even considering whatever it is now, it will also always be the country that saved my family.\n\nPeople are constantly asking me how long I’ll live abroad. I don’t have an answer.\n\nI was recently back in the States, seeing family and celebrating my (other) grandpa’s 90th birthday. Beyond some minor creature comforts that I’ve gotten used to living without (dryers, ice water, air conditioning), being close to family is the main thing I miss the most about the U.S.\n\nFor those who are considering a move abroad: Leaving will provide relief. But even though you can run away from America, you can’t run away from being American.","summary":"People are constantly asking me how long I’ll live abroad.

Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, as quoted in a report by Fox News.However, according to the book, he was worried that people would doubt her legitimacy as president and that Trump people would go apes--- if Harris were elected.Since Biden's death was unexpected, Simmons thought that if Harris were sworn in quickly, she would be bolstered by an institutional stamp of approval, Allen and Parnes wrote.ALSO READ: Hollywood feud goes nuclear: Blake Lively hit with explosive accusations from Justin Baldoni who claims she’s using legal system to extort and manipulate Her legitimacy might be questioned, he worried, recalling the January 6 effort to stop Biden from being certified as president.

He compiled a spreadsheet of those jurists across the country, down to a city-by-city breakdown, and carried it with him when he travelled with Harris, as per a report by Fox News.Simmons claimed he never informed Harris about the alleged death-pool roster prior to his departure with her communications team in January 2023, but he did give colleagues instructions to inform him right away if Biden did suffer a setback so he could carry out the communications plan. Simmons eventually left the spreadsheet with another employee of Harris.Did Obama support Harris in 2024?According to the book, former President Barack Obama was hesitant to support Harris in the 2024 election to succeed Biden because of doubts about Harris' political skills and his mental health.FAQsWhy did Kamala Harris' aide compile a list of GOP judges?Jamal Simmons reportedly expressed concern about a legitimacy crisis if Harris were to take office unexpectedly.

Trump claimed that he wasn’t just going to talk about the tariffs but would include other deals in the negotiations. He said he had spoken to the country’s acting president and discussed issues like shipbuilding, payments for military protection, and an Alaska pipeline. “We are likewise dealing with many other countries, all of whom want to make a deal with the United States,” he wrote, adding: “Like with South Korea, we are bringing up other subjects that are not covered by Trade and Tariffs, and getting them negotiated also. ‘ONE STOP SHOPPING’ is a beautiful and efficient process!!!” Apparently, the shopping deal isn’t available to China just yet. “We are waiting for their call,” said ","url":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/salesman-trump-boasts-one-stop-shopping-for-tariff-bargains/","image":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/AWPT5INDHNEZPCXWOSF3LGUVH4.jpg?smart=true&auth=e7a25164cb03df39db1a6015266d28357d6f6dd3afadffb1d48fa09b3046c48f&width=1440&height=1080","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-08 16:55:20","author":"David Gardner","authors":["David Gardner"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.078},{"id":309045476,"title":"Far-right activist Laura Loomer cements her influence after White House firings","text":"The US president, Donald Trump, met with far-right activist Laura Loomer in the Oval Office last week. Loomer is a figure so extreme that she is shunned by many, even in Trump’s “make America great again” (Maga) movement. \n\nHours after their meeting, Trump fired a string of national security officials, including General Timothy D. Haugh, the head of the National Security Agency and US Cyber Command, apparently at Loomer’s request. Trump has said Loomer was not involved in the firings, but also praised her judgment.\n\nEven for a president who has always listened to – and, indeed, echoed – fringe voices, the incident stood out. It served as a reminder that Trump is less constrained than ever before, and that his White House is responsive to his personal whims rather than any deliberative policy-making process. \n\nGone are the days of Trump’s first administration, when aides would at least try to block the most extreme conspiracy theorists from having access to the president. Now, apparently, even a four-star general (the highest officer rank) like Haugh serves only at the pleasure of figures such as Loomer.\n\nSo, who exactly is Loomer? She is, first and foremost, a media influencer – someone who made her name in far-right circles by spreading hate and conspiracy theories. \n\nShe calls herself a “proud Islamophobe” and “pro-white nationalism”. She has endorsed claims that the 9/11 terrorist attacks were an “inside job”, alleged that the “deep state” manipulates the weather to influence elections, and spread conspiracy theories implying that the FBI let school shootings happen in election years to help the Democrats push gun control.\n\nLoomer’s claims, and her open racism, have sometimes proven too much even for other prominent Maga figures, who prefer to be slightly more subtle in their messaging. \n\nWhen Loomer said in 2024 that if Kamala Harris won the election, the White House “will smell like curry” and speeches will be “facilitated via a call centre,” she drew push-back from the now vice-president, J.D. Vance, and far-right congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n\nBut Trump seems to have appreciated Loomer’s commentary all the same. The president has repeatedly praised her in public and backed her unsuccessful run as a Republican candidate for a US House of Representatives seat in Florida in 2020.\n\nLike many other Maga media figures, Loomer has realised that her antics give her direct exposure to a television-obsessed president, and that this exposure can be transformed into access and, ultimately, political power.\n\nLoomer, who is only 31, is entirely a product of the Trump era. As an adult, practically the only conservatism she has known is the conservatism of Maga – openly prejudiced, vindictive, and more a stew of grievance and hatred than a coherent political platform. \n\nInsofar as Loomer advocates for particular policies, they are a crude channeling of these impulses. She has campaigned for a ten-year immigration moratorium and has called for the death penalty for Democrats who oppose Trump.\n\nOn a podcast in June 2024 about whether Democrats should be prosecuted and jailed if Trump wins the election over alleged “unscrupulous behaviour,” Loomer said: “Not just jailed, they should get the death penalty. You know, we actually used to have the punishment for treason in this country.”\n\nBut the chief way in which Loomer personifies modern American conservatism is her single-minded loyalty to the president. Loyalty to Trump, and fury at the disloyalty of others, is the central component of her identity. \n\nDeep loyalty\n\nThis loyalty seems to be both a deeply felt emotion and also a shrewd way of recommending herself to the president. And, more than anything else, it was what landed her in the Oval Office last week.\n\nLoomer’s apparent recommendation that Trump fire a slew of national security officials had its roots in this obsession with loyalty. Many people serving in national security positions in the Trump administration are not card-carrying members of the Maga movement. \n\nThis reflects the fact that such positions require deep expertise developed over long apolitical careers in the civil service or military. As the product of a movement that disdains expertise and rationality, few Maga die-hards have the requisite knowledge to do these jobs.\n\nFor Loomer, such figures pose a threat. It ought to be emphasised that this is not because people like General Haugh have ever shown open disloyalty to Trump. It is merely that they are not, like Loomer, his fanatical adherents. In her worldview, anything less is unacceptable.\n\nTrump seems to agree, which opens the way to more firings in the future. Sensing her opening, Loomer has declared that she will establish an organisation dedicated to investigating executive branch officials for suspected disloyalty to the president. \n\nGovernment officials will have to live in fear of being targeted, creating a chilling atmosphere in which pushing back against Trump’s whims becomes impossible.\n\nLoomer’s growing influence also suggests that the Trump White House is becoming more chaotic and unpredictable. \n\nThe president’s aides have long claimed that the White House would be run in a controlled fashion this time around, with clear chains of command and questionable outsiders kept away. Loomer’s presence in the Oval Office – at Trump’s personal request – blows that story away.\n\nFor her part, Loomer seems to have what she has always wanted: the president’s attention. Where might she direct it next?","summary":"Laura Loomer, a far-right political activist, has become one of Trump’s confidantes.","url":"https://theconversation.com/far-right-activist-laura-loomer-cements-her-influence-after-white-house-firings-253870","image":"https://images.theconversation.com/files/660400/original/file-20250408-56-26yebo.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C291%2C3240%2C1620&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-08 16:33:48","author":"Andrew Gawthorpe,Lecturer in History and International Studies,Leiden University","authors":["Andrew Gawthorpe","Lecturer in History and International Studies","Leiden University"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"AU","sentiment":0.148},{"id":309044140,"title":"Is Trump not fit for office?

Biden turned 82 shortly after the November election. The Trump camp often referenced Trump being younger and fitter than Biden on the campaign trail.There was a controversy over Trump's medical records last October after he said he would \"gladly\" release the documents and then failed to produce them.Former White House physician Jeffrey Kuhlman, who was the physician for Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, said at the time that Trump \"appears in good health\" but raised alarms about Trump's cognitive ability.\"He exhibits cognitive decline in reasoning, memory, and processing speed, consistent with his advanced age,\" Kuhlman said.Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt, now White House press secretary, called the Los Angeles Times coverage of Kuhlman's assessment \"a garbage article based on a bunch of 'sources' who have no idea what they're talking about and are trying to deflect from the fact that our sitting president, Joe Biden, was ousted off the Democrat ticket due to his clear cognitive decline.\"\"President Trump is sharp as a tack and executes a rigorous campaign schedule every single day,\" she added.After Harris released her medical records, Trump wrote on Truth Social: \"Kamala's Medical Report is really bad. With all of the problems that she has, there is a real question as to whether or not she should be running for President! MY REPORT IS PERFECT - NO PROBLEMS!!!\"There were questions about Trump's mental health after he was shot at during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, in September. Several mental health experts told The Independent they had concerns about how this trauma would affect Trump.What People Are SayingTrump has previously insisted that he is \"cognitively very strong\" and has called his tendency to veer off topic, something which was cited by these healthcare professionals, \"the weave.\"\"When I do the weave...I'll talk about nine different things and they all come back brilliantly together.\"What Happens NextTrump will undergo his annual physical examination on April 11.

These are the people who care for us and our families when we need it most, and I believe we should show up for them with the same unwavering dedication they show up with every single day,” Stamos continued. “I stand by the importance of healthcare, of service, and of investing in those who care for our communities.” \n\n“My values and political views remain unchanged and if you don’t donate to Palm Beach Ray of Hope, then please consider donating to,” he concluded, sharing a link to Democracy Forward, a “national legal organization that advances democracy and social progress through litigation, policy and public education, and regulatory engagement,” according to its official website.\n\nIn the link to make donations, shared by Stamos, the page reads: “On Inauguration Day, President Trump swore an oath to the Constitution. We need your help to hold him and his administration accountable.”\n\nThe General Hospital alum has previously shared his political stance. During the 2020 presidential election, he publicly endorsed Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, posting a picture of himself alongside the former president in the White House on X after their win.\n\nLeading up to the 2024 election, he again shared his support for Harris. He was a part of the group of celebrities who signed up for the “Comics for Harris” Zoom call, which benefited her campaign.\n\nIn November, the day before election day, Stamos shared a message about “personal reflection” and his political views on Instagram.\n\n“I’m not here to tell anyone how to vote. This is not about dictating choices or dismissing opinions. But as we look ahead, it’s no secret who I will be casting my vote for,” he wrote in the caption. “We need a leader who prioritizes unity and strives to bridge the divides that have deepened over the past years. My hope is that this election leads to a renewed focus on bringing people together, fostering dialogue, and seeking justice and equality for all.”\n\nStamos concluded: “At the end of the day, I wish for a safe and honest election. And no matter the outcome, I will support the elected president and pray for a peaceful and honest transition. Let’s remember that despite our differences, we share a common humanity.

The Detroit News reported Oakland University and Wayne State University also had student visas revoked.\n\nAnd the trend extends beyond Michigan campuses.\n\nColleges around the country are reporting some of their international students’ visas are being revoked unexpectedly, expressing alarm over what appears to be a new level of government scrutiny.\n\nVisas can be canceled for a number of reasons, but many college leaders say the government has been quietly terminating students’ legal residency status with little notice to students or schools. That marks a shift from past practice and leaves students vulnerable to detention and deportation.\n\nThe list of colleges outside of Michigan that have discovered students have had their legal status terminated includes Harvard, Stanford, UCLA and Ohio State University.\n\nThe Trump administration has targeted students who had been involved with pro-Palestinian activism or speech, with a few high-profile detentions of students including Mahmoud Khalil, a green card holder who was a leader of protests at Columbia University.\n\nBut more schools are seeing visas stripped from students with no known connection to protests. In some cases, past infractions such as traffic violations have been cited. Some colleges say the reasons remain unclear to them — and they are seeking answers.\n\n“What you’re seeing happening with international students is really a piece of the much greater scrutiny that the Trump administration is bringing to bear on immigrants of all different categories,” said Michelle Mittelstadt, director of public affairs at the Migration Policy Institute.\n\nMany college officials and students have only found out about the changes when they have checked a federal database and seen changes to an individual’s immigration status. GVSU officials, for example, said they learned of their two students’ revoked visas after media reports about other universities led the Allendale-based university to check the database.\n\nFounded in 1963, SVSU is the youngest of Michigan’s 15 state universities. When the academic year launched last fall, the Kochville Township-based college reported more than 6,800 students enrolled in classes there. Of those, about 250 international students, or about 3.6%, from 45 countries enrolled at SVSU.\n\nThe university served as host for one of the presidential campaign stops for then-candidate Trump, who visited SVSU four weeks before Election Day.\n\nDuring his campaign, the Republican regularly cited plans to pursue policy related to non-citizens living in the U.S., including promises of mass deportations and additional border security measures.\n\nDuring his Oct. 3 appearance at SVSU, Trump revisited that focus on immigration policy plans. He repeated a story about Springfield, Ohio, where Trump falsely claimed Haitian immigrants were eating residents’ cats and dogs.\n\nSVSU resides in a county that favored Trump in November. Considered by some political experts as “a swing county in a swing state,” Saginaw County residents favored Trump over Democrat Kamala Harris, 52,912 to 49,515 votes, or a victory margin of 3.3 percentage points.\n\nTrump bested Harris across Michigan by more than 80,000 votes, or a 1.4-percentage point victory margin.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nWant more Bay City- and Saginaw-area news?

Smith now says he’s ‘serious’ and ‘leaving all doors open’ on presidential run","text":"ESPN host Stephen A. Smith appears to be inching closer to officially throwing his hat into the 2028 Democratic presidential primary, declaring that he’s “leaving all doors open” after claiming in a recent interview that he’s growing “more serious about” a candidacy.\n\nThe bombastic sports commentator, who has been devoting more of his energy to political punditry since last year’s election, shared an article on Monday that stated he was no longer ruling out the possibility of a presidential run.\n\n“Time to stop messing around. Life is great. Especially at ESPN/Disney. Hate the thought of being a politician. But sick of this mess,” Smith added. “So I’m officially leaving all doors open.”\n\nIn the interview that Smith tweeted out, he said that while he has “no desire” to run for office since he’s “living a pretty good life right now” and he’s never seen himself as a politician, he feels that the current political environment demands he toss his hat into the ring. \n\n“Over the last few weeks, I’ve had no choice but to get more serious about it,” Smith asserted in a conversation with McVay Media President Mike McVay. “I’ve been approached by people on Capitol Hill. I’ve been approached by people who are elected officials in office, whether it’s governors or mayors or what have you.”\n\nAdding that people have “seriously” asked him about running, Smith said that he’s “no longer going to close that door” and keep all his options open. “If it comes in late 2026, 2027, where I look at this country and think it’s an absolute mess and there’s legitimate reason to believe … that I indeed have a legitimate shot to win the presidency of the United States,” the First Take host declared. “I am not going to rule it out.”\n\nSmith, who recently signed a $100 million contract extension with ESPN that gives him more freedom to engage in political commentary, has grown increasingly outspoken about the Democratic Party’s shortcomings following President Donald Trump’s victory. While remaining largely critical of the president and his policies, Smith has fumed about how much Democrats “suck” while suggesting he has the solution for the party’s ills, leading him to rise in polls of potential 2020 presidential hopefuls.\n\nHaving already boasted that he could “beat them all” in a 2028 Democratic primary, Smith’s growing confidence in an official candidacy may have been boosted by a recent survey from GOP-leaning pollster Rasmussen that found him competitive against prominent Democratic contenders.\n\nIn a hypothetical head-to-head matchup with 2024 Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, Smith would pull in 24 percent of likely Democratic voters against Harris’ 45 percent. However, matched up with progressive congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez or California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Smith was only down single digits.\n\nIn a recent interview with late-night host Jimmy Fallon, Smith quipped that the reason his name has been floated as a possible presidential candidate is that “folks are nuts” before taking aim at Democrats for dropping the ball during the 2024 election.\n\n“Number two, the Democrat Party, they lost. They had a bad few months. We all know this. And even though there’s a lot of qualified Democrats all over the country from a local perspective — governors, mayors, stuff like that — there’s no real national voice,” he insisted. “Enter moi. They’ve come to me.”\n\nAt the same time, Democrats have started to gain back some traction in recent weeks following a dispiriting few months after Trump’s victory that saw public approval of the party fall to record lows. \n\nThe Trump administration has sparked public furor in recent weeks over DOGE’s slash-and-burn dismantling of federal agencies and the president causing an economic crisis with his sweeping tariffs. On top of that, the White House has come under fire over the Signalgate scandal and deportations of non-criminals to El Salvador’s ultra-max prison, all of which resulted in nationwide protests against the administration this past weekend.\n\nDemocrats also easily won a Wisconsin Supreme Court race last week, which became something of a referendum against Trump and his “first buddy” Elon Musk, who tossed $20 million into the race.\n\nMeanwhile, Smith’s foray into national politics hasn’t been met with open arms by all Democrats. Former Clinton strategist James Carville, for instance, said that while Smith is “really insightful” about sports, he doesn’t “know his a** from a hole in the ground” when it comes to politics. \n\nSmith has also faced backlash over a friendly interview he conducted with far-right extremist Candace Owens, who has faced condemnation from both liberals and conservatives for peddling outlandish conspiracy theories and antisemitic tropes. Making matters worse, infamous white supremacist Nick Fuentes celebrated the sitdown with Owens, saying that Smith is “clearly red-pilled.”","summary":"‘Time to stop messing around. Life is great.

The political scenario in the country is like a hot piping pot of soup; the more ingredients you add, the more it will change the taste of it and make it worse. It’s like too many cooks (we mean decisions) spoiling the broth kind of situation. \n\nTrump, who first rose to power in 2016, has been known for his radical style of governance, with many implying that America is shifting towards becoming an authoritarian style of leadership after the 78-year-old’s arrival. However, many people are unhappy due to his erratic policies, homophobic statements, among other problematic things. Regardless, media reports claim that Donald Trump is still eyeing another term of rule.\n\nPresently, the 22nd Amendment of the American Constitution states that “No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.” This act was enacted in 1951 after former president Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected four times.\n\nHowever, if the rules get changed, he shall be able to run for another term, but this time alongside tough competitors since other former presidents would also be able to participate in the amendment of the act. Yet, certain other inevitable causes might hinder Trump from fulfilling his dream.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nAs per The Irish Star, insider sources claim that owing to Trump’s age, he might pass away before being able to amend the constitution to run for a third term. 78-year-old Trump was the same age as former president Joe Biden in 2021 when he ran for his second term. Considering Joe Biden’s decision to step down from the elections and pass on the legacy to Kamala Harris owing to his old age, people are not very sure where Mr. Trump would be in terms of his well-being in three years.\n\nMoreover, author Michael Wolf, who spoke to numerous government insiders for his explosive ‘All or Nothing’ book around Trump’s second rise to power, told The Telegraph that the ‘Make America Great Again (MAGA) Movement’ would not be the same without Donald Trump’s presence and his fierce personality. Wolff claimed, “It will end because Donald Trump will die. He’s 78 years old; it’s safe to say he will die.”\n\n在 Instagram 查看這則貼文\n\nFurthermore, Trump has also faced scrutiny over his health. For instance, several sources have revealed that Trump’s health has started deteriorating, and he’s allegedly begun showing early signs of dementia (a mental illness). A few weeks earlier, a clip of him struggling to read was posted on X (formerly Twitter).\n\nIn the clip, Trump incorrectly pronounces the word “patron saint” by instead saying “patriot saint” and then later repeating it once again. In addition, popular psychotherapist Dr. John Gartner agreed in an interview that Trump’s motor skills have begun to slow down with age. His conduct also shows rigidity and not being capable of communicating several things.\n\nThis may explain his recent meltdown when a reporter asked him about the ongoing investigation of the Signal chat leak. He scolded the reporter and asked her not to ask it again. In several media interviews, his physical health also seems to weaken; earlier, he was fit and maintained a graceful posture, but now he is often seen slouching.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nDr. John Gartner came to the conclusion that maybe because of dementia, both the brain and the body are not working well. However, nothing has been confirmed by Trump or the White House authorities. Whether Trump is serious about truly running for other terms remains uncertain, as his will for a total return to power could be seen as an overreach of authority.\n\nAlso, author Michael Wolf further emphasized that Vice President JD Vance, a potential successor as per media reports, is unlikely to take over if Donald Trump’s health deteriorates and he’s unable to function.","summary":"Will Donald Trump be physically and mentally fit to run for a third term in the future?

He's revived complaints against TV networks, challenged the funding of public media, and blocked some news outlets from covering events. His proposed tariffs have caused chaos in the global markets, raising the specter of a recession and threatening media and entertainment along with the rest of the business world.Here's a closer look at how Trump's influence has rattled media and entertainment.Trump's influence was felt long before he took office for the second time.Notably, during the campaign, The Washington Post and Los Angeles Times reversed their long-standing practices of endorsing presidential candidates. This raised concerns inside and outside those papers that the news outlets were self-censoring out of fear of retaliation by Trump. Post owner Jeff Bezos said he made the decision because many people believe the media is biased and presidential endorsements don't help. Times owner Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong said he sought to be less divisive in a rocky election year.Then, during the early days of Trump's new term, Bezos shook up the paper's opinion section.The moves prompted a backlash. There was a staff upheaval and mass subscription cancellations at the Post, and some LA Times members resigned.While Trump bashes their credibility, mainstream news outlets are scrambling to reverse a protracted decline in audience trust by increasing transparency and deepening engagement. But trust will take a long time to restore, and the shift to digital has weakened the business models of many news outlets, making it harder for them to fight back.One exception is The New York Times, which is one of the biggest business successes among traditional news outlets. In a post-election memo, it promised to be \"unflinching\" but \"fair\" in its coverage of Trump.Read: NYT, WSJ, NBC, and others tell us how they're tackling a crisis that's bigger than TrumpMedia and entertainment conglomerates have joined others in corporate America in overhauling their corporate diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts in response to Trump's DEI crackdown.Disney's moves here were notable, as CEO Bob Iger has criticized Trump's policies in the past and championed liberal themes in Disney's TV shows and films. That said, even before Trump's return, Iger had said repeatedly that Disney's main mission is to entertain rather than advance a political agenda.As big entertainment companies have cut back on DEI on the business side, creatives and their reps say there's also been a chill on liberal themes in programming.Hollywood insiders told BI the shift has taken the form of studio execs asking producers to tweak storylines and characters — or nixing them altogether — and companies backing off past directives to ensure casts were diverse.Read: Trump is influencing Hollywood like no president beforeMany bankers and investors expected Trump's return to the White House to usher in a pro-business climate favorable for dealmaking. This was particularly relevant in entertainment. The biggest deals at stake were Skydance Media's long-awaited merger with Paramount Global and Comcast's plans to spin off most of its NBCUniversal cable channels.The hopes for an easy climate began to fade quickly, however.Trump has assailed multiple news outlets, including Comcast's NBC News. Before the election, he sued Paramount's CBS, alleging its \"60 Minutes\" manipulated an interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris in her favor. The suit is pending.Then Trump ordered sweeping tariffs, which could clobber media and entertainment companies on the advertising and consumer revenue fronts.Media and entertainment stocks fell on the tariff news. Debt-laden Warner Bros. Discovery and parks-dependent Disney were hit the most while Netflix, protected by its utility-like status, was among those impacted the least.The tariffs could cause Hollywood, which was already struggling to recover from historic labor strikes, a spending pullback, and the LA fires, to greenlight still fewer shows if they take their toll on consumer spending and production costs.Read: Meta and Amazon's ad businesses could get whacked by Trump's tariffs.

Given the concerns surrounding Biden's health, which led him to relinquish his candidacy to Kamala Harris last year, there are now questions about Trump's well-being in three years' time. Furthermore, Trump 's well-documented fondness for fast food has sparked concerns that his physical health may decline before any potential cognitive decline. Despite Trump's hints at seeking a third term and changing the constitution to allow it, author Michael Wolf believes it's more likely that he will pass away. Michael, who spoke to numerous government insiders for his explosive book All or Nothing about Trump's second rise to power, told The Telegraph that Trump's death would mark the end of the MAGA (Make America Great Again) era, rather than a mere pause. Michael explained: \"It will end because Donald Trump will die. He's 78 years old, it's safe to say he will die. \" JD Vance is not going to take over. No one will. MAGA as a movement can go on, but it will go on as any other kind of political movement among many. Without Trump there's not that velocity, personality, that thing no one can get their heads around.\" Mr Wolf hinted that the energy and drive of MAGA might fizzle out after Trump . Meanwhile, Trump's tariffs have sparked widespread chaos across the global economy. Since tariffs were introduced on friends and foes alike on what's been dubbed 'Liberation Day' on April 2, global markets have taken a beating. These tariffs, which vary from 10 percent to over 50 percent, have toppled a worldwide trade balance that had stood for more than a century. The consequences of these tariffs are multifaceted; not only will they hike up prices on daily commodities for average Americans, but they will also ripple across businesses globally. In Britain, for instance, the Hollywood-loved Range Rover producers Jaguar Land Rover have ceased exports to the US. On another front, UK Health Secretary Wes Streeting has echoed concerns, warning that Trump’s colossal tariffs may disrupt the flow of vital medications into the nation. Speaking on Sky News, he disclosed that \"issues with medicines production and supply internationally\" exist. He added: \"We are constantly watching and acting on this situation to try and get medicines into the country, to make sure we've got availability, to show some flexibility in terms of how medicines are dispensed, to deal with shortages. \"But whether it's medicines, whether it's parts for manufacturing, whether it's... the ability of businesses in this country to turn a profit, this is an extremely turbulent situation.... We work on a daily basis to make sure that we have the medicine supply this country needs.\"","summary":"The 47th President has hinted at seeking a third term, with the 22nd amendment of the US Constitution - which limits the President to two four year terms - being a &quot;bridge too far&quot;","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/donald-trump-author-says-it-35016565","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article35014854.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/0_TOPSHOT-US-POLITICS-TRUMP-AUTO-TARIFFS.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-08 14:25:32","author":"Christopher Sharp","authors":["Christopher Sharp"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.251},{"id":309127984,"title":"‘Feeling a little glee’: Dave Portnoy gets no sympathy after revealing tariffs cost him $20 million","text":"Critics of Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy are celebrating after he said he’s lost close to $20 million thanks to President Donald Trump’s tariffs.\n\nDuring a Monday livestream on X, Portnoy claimed that 10-15% of his net worth vanished in just three days, as Trump’s economic policies crashed the stock and crypto market.\n\n“I haven’t even looked, but if I had to guess, I probably lost $20 million in the last 3 days,” he said. “10 to 15 percent of my net worth… poof.” \n\nPortnoy, a vocal supporter of Trump, didn’t shy away from placing the blame directly on the president. \n\n“This is a decision that one guy made that crashed the whole stock market,” Portnoy said.\n\nYet despite the substantial loss, and complaints over Trump golfing amid the economic disaster, Portnoy declined to reverse his support.\n\n“Do I like it?

The president on Tuesday evening will headline a major donor event in the nation's capital for the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), which is the House GOP's campaign arm. The fundraiser is expected to haul in at least $10 million for the NRCC, a source familiar with the event tells Fox News. Republicans currently control the House – when the chamber returns to full strength – with a fragile 220-215 majority, and fundraising will be crucial to the GOP's game-plan to keep control. CONGRESSIONAL DEMOCRATS TARGETING THESE HOUSE REPUBLICANS IN 2026 MIDTERM BATTLE Asked what concerns him the most when it comes to defending the House majority, NRCC chair Rep. Richard Hudson said in a Fox News Digital interview on Monday that \"Democrats have a structural advantage when it comes to fundraising. They always seem to have just mountains of money. So I think the amount of money the Democrats raise is probably the only thing that really concerns me.\" \"We have to raise enough money to keep up with the Democrats and make sure that our candidates can get their message out,\" Hudson emphasized. Hudson, a North Carolina Republican and 12-year veteran of the House, said that \"the President understands that he's got to keep the House majority in the midterm so that he has a four-year runway, instead of a two-year runway to get his agenda enacted.\" And pointing to the House Democratic leader, Hudson added, \"Speaker Hakeem Jeffries would fight President Trump on every front, and it would be really difficult for him to achieve his agenda. President Trump understands it's important to hold the House and he's, he's been extremely helpful to us and we appreciate it.\" WERE LAST WEEK'S ELECTIONS IN WISCONSIN AND FLORIDA A CRYSTAL BALL FOR THINGS TO COME IN NEXT YEAR'S MIDTERMS? Hours before Trump was scheduled to attend the NRCC fundraiser, the House Democrats' campaign arm took aim at nearly three dozen Republican-held seats in the chamber as they aim to win back the majority. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) on Tuesday morning released its initial 2026 target list, which included 35 GOP-controlled seats, and launched an effort to fundraise for the party's eventual nominees in each of the districts. The DCCC emphasized that their moves signal that \"Democrats are on offense and poised to win the majority in 2026.\" POLL POSITION: WHERE TRUMP STANDS WITH AMERICANS 11 WEEKS INTO HIS SECOND TOUR OF DUTY IN THE WHITE HOUSE The unveiling of the DCCC list came three weeks after the NRCC went up with its initial target list, which took aim at 26 districts controlled by House Democrats. \"House Republicans are running scared, and they should be. They’re tanking the economy, gutting Medicaid, abandoning our veterans, and making everything more expensive. In short, they’ve lost the trust of their constituents, and it’s going to cost them the majority,\" DCCC Chair Rep. Suzan DelBene of Washington state charged in a statement announcing the moves. While the party in power, which clearly is the Republicans, traditionally faces serious political headwinds in the midterm elections, the NRCC is optimistic they can defend their majority. \"If you look at the landscape for the 2026 election, there are only three Republicans in districts that [former vice president and 2024 Democratic presidential nominee] Kamala Harris carried, but there are 13 Democrats in seats that Donald Trump carried, and half of those are majority Hispanic districts that President Trump has really put in play for us,\" Hudson reiterated. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The NRCC also points to the growing number of House Democrats who are seeking statewide office in 2026 rather than running for re-election. Hudson said the trend would \"absolutely\" help the GOP defend the majority next year. \"It's much easier to win an open seat than a seat with a Democrat incumbent who's entrenched.,\" Hudson said. \"I think it's incredibly helpful, and I think you're going to see a whole lot more Democrats running for other offices and retiring.\"","summary":"President Donald Trump is stepping up his fundraising efforts on behalf of congressional Republicans who expect a bruising 2026 midterm battle to defend a razor-thin House majority.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-hauls-millions-house-gop-2026-war-chest-dems-taunt-running-scared","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/04/931/523/richard-hudson-nrcc-dc-april-7-2025.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-08 13:36:16","author":"Paul Steinhauser","authors":["Paul Steinhauser"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.099},{"id":308957490,"title":"Gabbard establishes new Intelligence Community task force to restore transparency","text":"EXCLUSIVE: Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard established a new task force charged with restoring transparency and accountability in the intelligence community, Fox News Digital has learned. The group, dubbed the Director’s Initiative Group (DIG), is starting by investigating weaponization within the intelligence community. TULSI GABBARD REVOKES SECURITY CLEARANCES, ACCESS TO CLASSIFIED INFORMATION FOR BIDEN, HARRIS, CLINTON, OTHERS Officials said the group will also work to root out politicization and expose unauthorized disclosures of classified intelligence. It will also work to declassify information \"that serves a public interest.\" So far, the Director’s Initiative Group has reviewed documents for potential declassification, including information related to the origins of COVID-19 and the John F. Kennedy Jr., Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. assassination files; the original Trump–Russia investigation; anomalous health incidents; the Biden administration’s domestic surveillance and censorship against Americans and more. Officials told Fox News Digital that the Director’s Initiative Group also is leading assessments of the structure of the intelligence community, its resources and its personnel to \"approve efficiency and eliminate wasteful spending.\" Gabbard told Fox News Digital that she established the group \"in order to rebuild trust in the intelligence community and execute the tasks required by President Trump’s intelligence-related executive orders.\" \"We are already identifying wasteful spending in real time, streamlining outdated processes, reviewing documents for declassification, and leading ongoing efforts to root out abuses of power and politicization,\" Gabbard told Fox News Digital.

In February, Gabbard said former President Joe Biden's administration was aware of \"very sexually explicit, highly inappropriate and unprofessional chatter\" happening on internal agency messaging boards across national intelligence entities for years, but they allowed it to go on.

In a recent CNN interview, Walz called out Kamala Harris for her recent “I told you so” moment. During his appearance on CNN's State of the Union on Sunday, the former vice presidential candidate and current governor of Minnesota took a moment to attack former running mate Kamala Harris for remarks she made the previous week.Governor Tim Walz argued that Democrats should accept responsibility for their mistakes rather than casting blame.Speaking to CNN, he urged the party to reflect, reconnect with working-class voters, and rebuild its identity following a significant loss that he believes could have been avoided, as per a report by Salon.ALSO READ: Have Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift broken up? Rumors suggesting a break up between the two are trending online; here's the truthWhat did Kamala Harris say that sparked this?Speaking Thursday at the Leading Women Defined Summit in California, Harris portrayed an insider advisor whose counsel went unheeded.“We knew a lot of things were going to happen.” “'I told you so,' I'm not here to say,’”' the former vice president declared. I promised myself I wouldn't say that! Why is Tim Walz blaming the Democrats too?Tim Walz unleashed his fury on the former vice president in an interview with Jake Tapper. He asserted that it is time for ownership, not finger-pointing if the party wants to move forward. She should take responsibility for the outcome, he said, pointing out that she was the face of the Democratic Party's crushing defeat.Tim Walz remarked, I'm criticizing myself when I criticize. This belongs to me. Someone needs to come up with a plan, and I'm on the ticket,” as quoted in a report by Salon.According to Tapper, Harris' warnings were not compelling enough to win, and Walz reciprocated.What kind of message does Tim Walz think voters need?Democrats shouldn't spend the next four years engaging in sarcasm and barbs, according to Walz. He urged the party to reflect and determine why voters weren't responding favourably to their message. “Democrats should ask themselves, with everything out there, did they not think we were any better than that? This is a structural issue that will require a lot more thought, Walz stated, as per a report by Salon.According to Walz, the president has won over a group of voters whose economic future is so precarious it could slip out from under them and has tasked the party with developing an appeal to them. It was simple for me to identify a Democrat when I was younger. They supported labour and the working class. He claimed that Republicans were for the rich. Today, you ask people, they don't know. Tim Walz's solution appears to be an easily understood message and a clear identity for Democrats. He thinks that since Democrats failed to protect Social Security and Medicare, they should concentrate on doing so.FAQsWhat did Kamala Harris say to upset Tim Walz?At a recent summit, Harris hinted that she predicted the loss, saying, I'm not here to say I told you so, which Walz interpreted as passive finger-pointing. He stated that those involved in the campaign, including Harris, should own the defeat rather than playing the blame game.What changes does Tim Walz seek from the Democratic Party?Tim Walz believes that Democrats require a clearer message that resonates with ordinary Americans. He claims the party has lost touch with working-class voters and must rebuild trust by focusing on real issues such as economic security, Social Security, and Medicare, issues that once defined the party.","summary":"Tim Walz, the Governor of Minnesota, has criticised Kamala Harris for her recent comments.

While some counties have chosen to collaborate fully with ICE, others, enforce sanctuary policies, which limits cooperation. Meanwhile, Walz, who was Kamala Harris' running mate, lost the presidential election to the Trump-JD Vance ticket. Immigration played a key role in the 2024 election.What To KnowGovernor Walz supports sanctuary policies that limit cooperation between local law enforcement and immigration authorities.In early 2023, Walz expanded driver's licenses to all residents in Minnesota, regardless of their immigration status. It was estimated that around 81,000 undocumented migrants would benefit from the bill, which allowed them to apply for a state-issued ID card.\"My position on Minnesota becoming a sanctuary state boils down to who has the responsibility for enforcing immigration laws. Here's what I believe: Congress has given federal agencies the authority to enforce immigration laws in Minnesota, and I support their doing so. Congress has not given local law enforcement that same authority. The role of law enforcement is to enforce state and local laws, not federal immigration laws, and I strongly believe that they should not do,\" Walz said in 2019.Since Trump took office, the sheriff's offices in Minnesota's Cass, Crow Wing, Freeborn, Itasca, and Jackson counties have entered into 287(g) agreements with ICE. These agreements allow the federal immigration agency to delegate certain immigration enforcement responsibilities to local law enforcement, according to a report by the Sahan Journal, a nonprofit digital newsroom reporting for immigrants and communities of color in Minnesota.The agreements facilitate greater cooperation between local law enforcement agencies and ICE, including programs aimed at identifying and processing undocumented immigrants already in custody who are eligible for deportation. Another program employs a \"task force model,\" where local agencies act as a \"force multiplier\" for ICE, per the report.The recent agreements signed by the five sheriff's offices with ICE bring the total number of offices participating in the 287(g) program in Minnesota to seven, according to the Sahan Journal. These new counties join Sherburne and Kandiyohi counties, which have had cooperation agreements with ICE for some time.Local police officers who have been \"deputized\" are granted the authority to enforce federal immigration laws. This usually occurs through programs like 287(g), where local law enforcement collaborates with federal immigration agencies to carry out immigration enforcement activities. As a result, this partnership can lead to more coordinated sweeps and enforcement actions in communities across cities and towns.​Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison has expressed concerns about local law enforcement's involvement in federal immigration enforcement,What People Are SayingA spokesperson for Ellison's office told the Sahan Journal: \"While 287g agreements are sometimes touted as a tool for getting violent offenders off the street, studies have shown that large numbers of people detained through 287g-related enforcement have committed only misdemeanors or traffic violations.\"What Happens NextAs the 287(g) agreements continue to expand across Minnesota, local law enforcement agencies will likely face increasing pressure from both advocates and critics of the program.","summary":"Five sheriff's offices have inked cooperation agreements with federal immigration authorities in a blow to sanctuary policies.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/tim-walz-suffers-blow-ice-minnesota-2056753","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2623034/tim-walz.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-08 12:33:06","author":"Billal Rahman","authors":["Billal Rahman"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.591},{"id":308941268,"title":"Donald Trump's Strong Disapproval Rating Surges","text":"Donald Trump is facing a sharp rise in disapproval ratings similar to that of November, 2018, when the Republicans lost control of the House of Representatives, according to new polling data.Why It MattersA shift in Trump's numbers could influence support from Republican lawmakers, affect his ability to push through his agenda and shape the political landscape, heading into the midterm election cycle.What To KnowAccording to CNN pollster Harry Enten, Trump's disapproval rating is currently at a similar level to November 2018, when the Republicans lost the House in the midterms and the Democrats gained 41 seats. At the time, 42 percent disapproved of Trump's job performance, according to Enten's analysis.Now, that number stands at 43 percent. According to Enten, that could be a bad sign for Trump, who is still more than a year away from the next round of midterm elections.Trump began his second term with relatively strong approval ratings. Polls showed that he was more popular than ever. But in the last month, that popularity has begun to unravel as polls have shown that voters are dissatisfied with his handling of the economy.That was amplified last week when Trump announced his new program of \"Liberation Day\" tariffs, which included a 10 percent baseline tariff on all imports, including those from U.S. allies and non-economically active regions, along with higher rates for countries with large trade surpluses with the U.S.Trump's announcement sent the markets into turmoil on Thursday, Wall Street recording its worst day since 2020, when COVID-19 was in full swing. Meanwhile, by market close on Monday, the S&P 500 slipped 0.2 percent, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 349 points, or 0.9 percent.But Trump has defended his tariffs plan, telling reporters \"sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.\"He has also argued that countries will no longer will be able to abuse and take advantage of the U.S. under the new tariffs.\"Oil prices are down, interest rates are down (the slow moving Fed should cut rates!), food prices are down, there is NO INFLATION, and the long time abused USA is bringing in Billions of Dollars a week from the abusing countries on Tariffs that are already in place,\" Trump said on Truth Social.But economists remain unconvinced that the U.S. won't see any negative impact. CNBC host and market analyst Jim Cramer on Saturday warned of a repeat of the devastating \"Black Monday\" collapse of October 19, 1987, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average saw its worse single-day fall and plummeted 22.6 percent.University of Southern California professor Jonathan Aronson also warned that states including California and Texas will likely see reduced imports and therefore higher prices because of the tariffs.\"In 2024, California was the largest importer of goods—$509 billion, close to 30 percent from China,\" he told Newsweek. Texas was second with $384 billion of imports. The tariffs will likely cut down imports and raise prices in both states.\"There are also fears that the tariffs could cause inflation and possibly ignite a recession.Former Federal Reserve Governor, Frederic Mishkin, told Newsweek last week: \"If Trump puts in these kind of tariffs and we go into a trade war, the likelihood of a recession is going to be very high.\"He added that the tariffs would, in effect, amount to a \"huge tax increase,\" and contribute to a period of stagflation—slow economic growth, coupled with high unemployment and accelerating inflation.On Monday, Goldman Sachs raised its odds of a recession in 2025 to 35 percent, up from 20 percent previously. That is the company's highest recession probability since the regional banking crisis two years ago. JP Morgan now says the chances of a recession this year stand at 40 percent, both business sentiment and consumer confidence having slumped in recent weeks.According to a recent Fox News poll, an overwhelming 71 percent said they believe the United States economy will go into a recession this year, while just 26 percent disagreed. The poll had a margin of error of ±3 percentage points.A poll conducted by Marquette University Law School between March 17 and March 27 among 1,021 adults also showed that 58 percent of adults think tariffs hurt the U.S. economy. The same amount think Trump's policies will increase inflation. At the same time, polls have shown Trump's approval rating declining.Amid Trump's declining popularity, resistance toward Trump is growing, according to Enten, with searches online for \"protest\" up 1,200 percent since a year ago. That is exceeding the levels of searches for \"protest\" seen in January 2017, when thousands of people took to the streets in the aftermath of Trump's victory over Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.That same year, the Democrats performed on average 18 points better than Clinton in special elections, Enten's analysis shows—momentum that helped Democrats flip the House.Fast forward 8 years, and Democrats are now performing 19 points better in special elections than Kamala Harris did against Trump in 2024. That comes after Susan Crawford won a seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court, defeating conservative former Attorney General Brad Schimel by 9 points this month.After such results, Enten believes that resistance to Trump has now been reignited.\"If the resistance was a little bit lacking at the beginning of Trump's second term, it is very much alive now,\" he said.That renewed resistance was visible last week when thousands of people came out to protest against Trump and his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) head, Elon Musk. The protests were part of a series of nationwide demonstrations organized by a coalition of over 150 groups—including civil rights organizations, labor unions, LGBTQ+ advocates, veterans, and election activists.On the initial day of \"Hands Off\" protests, organizers reported over 1,300 rallies of varying sizes nationwide. In Washington, D.C, tens of thousands gathered on the National Mall to protest policies they claim favor billionaires at the expense of ordinary Americans.What People Are SayingHarry Enten said: \"The Democratic protest, the idea of protesting Donald Trump, if the resistance was a little bit lacking at the beginning of Trump's second term, it is very much alive now. The protests are out there, and the interest in protesting Donald Trump is definitely there now.\"What Happens NextIn 2026, Americans will head to the polls to elect new senators and representatives. The Democrats have vowed to flip both chambers, which are currently held by the Republicans.Trump's approval rating will likely fluctuate in the coming weeks, depending on the outcome of key events, including critical negotiations on the Russia-Ukraine war and the growing tariff battles.","summary":"Trump's approval rating has taken a notable hit, with disapproval numbers now mirroring levels seen during the 2018 midterm elections.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-approval-rating-2026-midterms-2056747","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2623041/trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-08 12:31:11","author":"Martha McHardy","authors":["Martha McHardy"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.15},{"id":308936666,"title":"Walters: Democratic candidates for governor wait for Harris to decide","text":"Irish playwright Samuel Beckett’s tragicomedy “Waiting for Godot” centers on two men, Vladimir and Estragon, who hope, in vain, that the arrival of a mysterious man named Godot will bring meaning to their otherwise miserable lives.\n\nIt’s considered to be a perfect example of Europe’s post-World War fascination with what was termed the “theater of the absurd.” That’s why it leaps to mind when one considers the dynamics of the ever-growing cadre of Democratic candidates for governor in 2026.\n\nAs their numbers expand, they are waiting for former Vice President Kamala Harris to tell the world whether she will try to keep her political career alive by seeking the governorship.\n\nHarris is apparently willing, ala Godot, to keep them waiting. Politico has reported that a month ago, at a pre-Oscars party, she told supporters that she won’t declare her intentions until late summer.\n\nThe uncertainty about her intentions affects what other hopefuls can do in the interim, such as raising campaign money. The big Democratic spenders, such as unions, the entertainment industry and Silicon Valley, are also waiting, leery about making commitments to other candidates until Harris decides.\n\nIt’s also evident that the lesser candidates, those little known and lacking deep-pocket support, such as former state Senate leader Toni Atkins, state schools Superintendent Tony Thurmond and former state Controller Betty Yee, would probably drop out if Harris runs.\n\nBut how about those who, in the absence of Harris, would be credible aspirants, such as Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, Congressmember Katie Porter and, most recently, former Attorney General Xavier Becerra?\n\nKounalakis and Porter have dropped hints that they would defer to Harris, but Villaraigosa has indicated he would still run and Becerra, in announcing his candidacy this week, declared he’s in it to stay.\n\nThe state’s top-two primary system plays a significant role in how the field eventually forms. Although polls indicate that Harris would be the frontrunner in the June primary, another Democrat could hope to finish second and thereby qualify for a runoff in November in which Republican and independent voters could be decisive.\n\nHowever, a crowded Democratic field that would fragment Democratic primary voters would also increase the likelihood that a Republican, such as Riverside Sheriff Chad Bianco, would finish second.\n\nThat situation, as past elections have shown, gives the Democratic nominee a huge advantage to win the governorship, given the state’s lopsided Democratic voter registration.\n\nWe saw that scenario last year when Congressmember Adam Schiff indirectly helped Republican Steve Garvey finish second in the primary duel for a U.S. Senate seat, freezing out Katie Porter. It could happen to her again next year, were she to remain in the gubernatorial race and the Harris campaign emulates Schiff’s tactic to help Bianco or some other Republican finish second.\n\nA runoff between Harris and another Democrat could be a test of her campaign ability in the wake of stumbling badly in her 2019 bid for the presidency and again last year after being tapped by Democratic leaders to take on Donald Trump after they forced Joe Biden out of a re-election bid.\n\nCalifornia’s voters have been in a restive mood of late, concerned about ever-rising living costs, especially for housing, the state’s seemingly intractable homelessness crisis and crime. Last year’s passage of Proposition 36, a measure to crack down on criminals, despite opposition from Gov. Gavin Newsom and other Democratic leaders, is one indication of voters’ sour mood.\n\nA Democratic candidate who exploits that angst and appeals to Republican and independent voters could mount a serious campaign against Harris — should she decide to run.\n\nDan Walters is a CalMatters columnist.","summary":"More hopefuls talk of entering race, but there's little they can do until former vice president declares her intentions.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/04/08/walters-democratic-candidates-for-governor-wait-for-harris-to-decide/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/SJM-L-HARRIS-HORVATH-0207-DK-09_219099456.jpg?w=1024&h=683","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-08 12:00:31","author":"Dan Walters","authors":["Dan Walters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.061},{"id":308970904,"title":"‘The Obamas Are Done’ — Michelle and Barack’s Issues Run Deeper Than What Meets the Eye!","text":"Barack Obama enjoyed global fame for eight years when he was elected as the President of the United States. He made history by becoming the first Black American to hold the position. Even his ‘perfect’ marriage with Michelle Obama and happy family life with their two daughters contributed to the admiration of fans around the world. But things have lately been rocky for the globally known power couple. \n\nIt’s been nearly a year since rumors of Barack’s affair surfaced in the media. Although Jennifer Aniston publicly denied having any romantic relationship with the former president, the rumors grew stronger as Michelle stopped making any public appearances with Barack. Be it Jimmy Carter’s funeral, Donald Trump’s inauguration, or a dinner outing with daughters, Michelle’s absence speaks volumes about the alleged troubles in their marriage. Even their well-planned Valentine’s or Birthday posts for each other can’t do much damage control now. \n\nHowever, it isn’t just their marriage that has been going downhill lately. Shockingly, Barack’s political relevance and influence have hit an all-time low. Once upon a time, Barack was the anchor of the Democratic Party. But the winds have changed their course now. A CNN poll conduced in March revealed that only 4% of Democrats say Barack Obama represents their party’s leadership. Some may find it hard to believe but he is now behind Kamala Harris and Bernie Sanders. \n\n‘Fight: Inside the Wildest Battle for the White House‘, a new political memoir by authors Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes analyze Barack Obama’s diminishing influence within the Democratic Party. The book gives an inside look at the Biden, Harris, and Trump campaigns during the 2024 presidential elections. It highlights Harris’ frustrations with Barack Obama when she asked for his support to replace Joe Biden on the Democratic ticket. \n\nObama faced immense pressure from top Democrats to support Harris but he was hesitant to endorse her. The authors wrote, “As the hours passed, and it became evident that she was well on her way to seizing the nomination by storm, Obama’s opposition to her grew more confounding,” as per Economic Times.\n\n“A confidant said that Harris was ‘very annoyed’ with him. They shared a large number of political allies and donors. The other members of the group joined her,” it further mentions. \n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by Barack Obama (@barackobama) \n\nIn an interview with MSNBC, Allen said that Obama tried to sabotage Harris by attempting to set up an open primary. Allen stated, “President Obama absolutely did not think that Joe Biden should continue, according to our sources close to President Obama,” while mentioning that he opposed Harris taking Biden’s place as well.\n\nOn the one hand, Barack believed that Harris couldn’t defeat Donald Trump, while on the other hand, Harris convinced top Democrats to side with her. Eventually, Barack realised “his actions against Biden and Harris could diminish him in the eyes of Democratic elites.”\n\nThe book reports, “It took days of intense negotiations to strike a deal on the simplest act in politics. The whole frame, including the script, was designed to elevate the Obamas by making it look like she was begging for their blessing. This was typical bulls—t. [Harris] had to fake surprise and enthusiasm.”\n\nEven the cultural influence the couple once had on people is declining. Michelle recently started her own podcast with her brother. Sadly, IMO with Michelle Obama and Craig Robinson, has been suffering from poor rating compared to other emerging competitors. As per Daily Mail, their podcast is ranked #34 on Spotify while Amy Poehler, who recently started her own podcast is at #3. Michelle also seems to be struggling with bringing high-profile guests on her podcast. The biggest star she could book for episode two was Issa Rae. \n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by Michelle Obama (@michelleobama) \n\nAnd let’s just say, nobody wants to see 61-year-old former first lady styling her hair in messy pom-poms for hour-long episodes. Columnist Maureen Callahan calls it “strangest female midlife crisis in recent memory” who is “acting, looking and sounding, frankly, like a teenager.”\n\nThe couple’s 2018 Netflix deal isn’t turning out too well either. Ted Sarandos, the head of Netflix, recently hinted that the Obamas’ productions is falling short of viewership. However, he added that he didn’t even expect its success either. He told Semafor, “They’re not big commercial projects, typically. There’s an element of prestige television that they brought to us.”\n\nIn another interview, when he was asked about the renewal of Obamas’ deal, he said, “I don’t want to comment on anyone’s renewals.”\n\nIn her column for Daily Mail, Maureen summed up their current life as “The Obamas are over.” It remains to be seen if and how the couple will recover from their diminishing popularity— among fans and within the Democratic Party.","summary":"Barack Obama and Michelle's rocky marriage is just tip of the iceberg as they are going through much worse!","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/the-obamas-are-done-michelle-and-baracks-issues-run-deeper-than-what-meets-the-eye","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Untitled-design-2025-04-08T163106.972.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-08 11:42:06","author":"Kanika","authors":["Kanika"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.08}]}
