Karp lauded those who work at Palantir for supporting free speech and for \"fighting for the right side of what should work in this country — meritocracy&comma; lethal technology.\" He noted that these values have helped the company — which makes software for companies and the US government — \"give normal Americans venture-quality results.\"Palantir reported nearly $1.2 billion in revenue&comma; a 63% bump since last year&comma; for the period ended in September&comma; the company said in a statement on Monday&comma; citing \"accelerating and otherworldly growth.\" Its US commercial revenue more than doubled in the last year&comma; up 121% to $397 million&comma; and US government revenue grew 52% to $486 million. (\"These are arguably the best results that any software company has ever delivered&comma;\" Karp said on the earnings call. \"That&apos;s not hyperbolic.\")Over the past year&comma; Silicon Valley has come to embrace anti-wokeness and President Donald Trump. Tech leaders&comma; including OpenAI&apos;s Sam Altman and Meta&apos;s Mark Zuckerberg&comma; extolled the president at a White House dinner earlier this fall. In October&comma; Marc Benioff&comma; the chief executive of Salesforce&comma; a competitor of Palantir&comma; called on Trump to deploy the National Guard to San Francisco&comma; although he walked back the remarks days later.\"We power ICE&comma;\" Karp said on Monday. \"We&apos;ve supported Israel. Okay&comma; these are very controversial. I don&apos;t know why this is all controversial&comma; but many people find that controversial.\"On the earnings call&comma; Karp said he makes \"sure Palantir stays as tribal and cultish and unique as it was 20 years ago\" by recruiting \"the right people.\"But the cult of Palantir isn&apos;t without its fair share of discourse and discomfort: The company&apos;s communications chief&comma; Lisa Gordon&comma; a self-proclaimed Democrat&comma; called Palantir&apos;s political shift toward Trump \"concerning\" in an interview at a summit hosted by tech news site The Information in late October. (The Information later removed videos of Gordon&apos;s interview from its social media accounts&comma; CNBC reported.)Karp didn&apos;t pull any punches on Monday&apos;s call&comma; asking for more border scrutiny and a refocus on so-called \"average poor\" Americans. \"If Fentanyl was killing 60&comma;000 Yale grads&comma; instead of 60&comma;000 working class people&comma; we&apos;d be dropping a nuclear bomb on whoever was sending it from South America&comma;\" Karp said. \"At Palantir&comma; we are on the side of the average American who sometimes gets screwed because all the empathy goes to elite people&comma; and none of it goes to the people actually dying on our streets. And that&apos;s why&comma; when you have an open border&comma; it means that the average poor American earns less.\"Karp backed former Vice President Kamala Harris&apos; campaign in 2024.In his shareholder letter&comma; Karp also preached a \"return to a shared national experience\" and an \"embrace of a common identity.\"\"It is and was a mistake to casually proclaim the equality of all cultures and cultural values&comma;\" he wrote&comma; without expounding upon which cultures he was referring to. \"Some have proven to be wondrous and generative. Others destructive and deeply regressive. And an even greater mistake is to believe that we could or should convert the world to our way of living.\"","summary":"Palantir sees \"accelerating and otherworldly growth\" as CEO Alex Karp highlights working with ICE and supporting Israel on an earnings call.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/palantir-ceo-alex-karp-calls-company-anti-woke-revenue-surge-2025-11","image":"https://i.insider.com/69094555c007ca8c27382af4?width=1200&format=jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-04 00:33:41","author":"Julia Hornstein","authors":["Julia Hornstein"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.161},{"id":375456964,"title":"Pelosi indicates she will address retirement rumors after Election Day","text":"Pelosi, who has served as House Speaker twice while representing California’s 19th Congressional District since 1987, addressed the rumblings of her retirement on Monday, the eve of Election Day.\n\n“I have said I won’t do anything until Preposition 50, so tomorrow night will be very fraught with meaning for all of us. I want to win big, I think we can win big, and I don‘t want to be spending time on whatever I might be doing. I want to spend my time on what we‘re doing, working together to get out the vote,” Pelosi said on CNN.\n\n“Own the ground, you win the election by owning the ground, and you can have all the persuasion in the world, you can have the biggest numbers in the polls, but if you don‘t own the ground, you‘re only having a conversation. You‘re not having a victory,” Pelosi said.\n\nPelosi spokesman Ian Krager echoed the speaker emerita’s comments on X, saying she is “fully focused” on California’s redistricting effort. He added that any discussion on her political future is “pure speculation.”\n\nFormer deputy assistant attorney general Elliott Williams said on a panel discussing Pelosi’s comments that it is “in the water” that most Democratic lawmakers are old, and the party needs “new leadership.” Williams also said partially as to why the party’s 2024 hopes “imploded” was due to then-President Joe Biden’s age, who was 81 before he dropped his reelection bid.\n\n2025 ELECTIONS LIVE UPDATES: LATEST ON RACES IN VIRGINIA, NEW JERSEY, AND NEW YORK\n\nDemocratic California state Sen.

Obama made clear, however, that he was not formally endorsing Mamdani, continuing his usual practice of avoiding direct intervention in municipal races.\n\n34-year-old Mamdani, a Uganda-born Democrat and state assembly member, currently leads the race in polls ahead of his main rival, former Governor Andrew Cuomo, and Republican Curtis Sliwa, per Reuters. His platform proposes major policy shifts: higher taxes on the city’s wealthiest, a corporation tax increase, frozen stabilized rents, and expanded public housing.\n\nDuring the call, says New York Post, Obama reportedly discussed some of the real-world challenges ahead, staffing an administration, executing high-stakes promises, and navigating a progressive agenda in a diverse city like New York. A spokesperson for Mamdani said he “appreciated President Obama’s words of support and their conversation on the importance of bringing a new kind of politics to our city.”\n\nCome on New York.\nYou know what to do!#zohranfornyc #Mamdani #zohranmamdani @ZohranKMamdani pic.twitter.com/UpkdWvKLkU\n— Jasmine Dotiwala OBE (@jasminedotiwala) October 30, 2025\n\nThe timing of the call is also significant. Obama also campaigned in other states this weekend, underscoring the national Democratic Party’s interest in his outreach, per NDTV.Even though the call was not a full endorsement, it could be seen as a subtle sign of support. It may even energise Mamdani’s base and raise his national profile.\n\nBut the moment also carries risk. Mamdani’s views on Israel and his identification with democratic socialism are already drawing criticism within the Democratic Party and from Jewish-American communities.\n\nObama could also be trying to gauge the public’s perception. He could be aligning himself with a rising progressive figure while trying not to alienate the moderate wing of the party.\n\nSome party strategists caution that the “sounding board” offer may invite more questions than clarity. Is this a soft endorsement? A mentoring gesture? Or simply a congratulatory call from a former president?No matter how you see it, it’s clear that Obama sees potential in Mamdani’s candidacy.\n\nMamdani took many people by surprisee when he defeated Cuomo in the Democratic primary in June. Since then, he has raised small-donor funds, gained endorsements from high-profile Democrats like Vice-President Kamala Harris and Governor Kathy Hochul, and surged in polls. \n\nObama remains influential in Democratic politics, even though he left the White House in 2017. Rather than formally entering races himself, he can offer his influence in a different way. He could do this by guiding up-and-coming leaders behind the scenes.\n\nIf Mamdani wins, they could form a working relationship anchored in mutual vision and mutual risk. If he falls, Obama’s gesture could come back to haunt him. \n\nThe call shows more than just politeness. It signals strategy, alignment and maybe even a recalibration within the Democratic Party. Mamdani may be running for New York City mayor, but the message is already national: the next generation of progressive leaders has arrived, and one of its architects is listening.","summary":"Former President Barack Obama phones frontrunner Zohran Mamdani ahead of the Nov. 4 election, praising his campaign and offering informal counsel — while stopping short of an official endorsement.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/obama-offers-to-be-mamdanis-sounding-board-as-nyc-mayoral-race-nears","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Obama-Mamdani.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-04 00:17:14","author":"Tracey Ashlee","authors":["Tracey Ashlee"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.294},{"id":375451158,"title":"EXCLUSIVE: New CBS News Boss Bari Weiss Accused of 'Bowing Down' to Donald Trump in First '60 Minutes' Interview Since His $16Million Settlement with Network over 'Deceptive Editing'","text":"Longtime television viewers say time is running out on legendary CBS news program 60 Minutes, after new boss Bari Weiss wasted no time in making big changes to the perceived left-leaning network. \n\nWeiss, 41, was brought aboard the network for her moderate and centrist views and is trying to right the ship after the news show faced battering accusations of favoring Democrats and going out of its way to make President Trump look bad.Trump Welcomed BackOn Sunday's edition, 60 Minutes welcomed Trump back for his first interview since he settled a multi-million dollar lawsuit against CBS after he accused the network of \"misleading editing\" on their interview with his then-presidential challenger Kamala Harris to make her responses \"seem more intelligible.\"\n\nThe wide-ranging interview touched on subjects as varied as the current government shutdown to his opinion of New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani. \n\nOne topic not covered on-air was the $16million payout CBS forked over. The only reference came at the beginning of Sunday's interview, when correspondent Norah O'Donnell told viewers parent company Paramount had settled the lawsuit, but made clear \"the settlement did not include an apology nor admission of wrongdoing.\"Viewer DisapprovalHowever, many viewers who watched the interview slammed it as a fluff piece that went easy on the president, and accused CBS of cowering before Trump.\n\n\"Bari Weiss' fingerprints are already all over 60 Minutes and CBS News,\" one person declared in a Reddit thread. \"We’re about a year away from it going full Fox News.\"\n\nAnother person chimed in: \"I watched the whole interview. It was just propaganda. No pushback from the interviewer on any point. Just let him talk nonsense with nothing but the occasional post-processing fact check spliced in between gratuitous rounds of bull. It was like watching a child be given softballs on a tee.\"\n\nWhile one person complained: \"This was the worst interview I've seen. No challenging questions, immediately move on to the next topic, etc.. You can tell when you watch it that there are a lot of cuts and it’s very heavily edited.\"Bringing Balance Back to CBSFormer New York Times opinion writer Weiss was brought in by Trump supporter and new Chairman and CEO of Paramount, David Ellison, to jolt the network news division out of its left-leaning and woke reporting.\n\n\"We believe the majority of the country longs for news that is balanced and fact-based, and we want CBS to be their home,\" Ellison stated in her October 6 hiring announcement, calling The Free Press founder a \"proven champion of independent, principled journalism.\"CBS Staffers 'Revolt'And she ruffled feathers on the flagship program almost immediately, when she reportedly called a meeting of the 60 Minutes staff on October 14 and asked, \"Why does the country think you’re biased?\" leaving them stunned.\n\n\"It was basically a revolt,\" a show source claimed to Hollywood insider Rob Shuter, who writes on Substack. \"They felt blindsided and humiliated and wanted to hit back.\"\n\nShuter reported the insider claimed correspondents Lesley Stahl, Scott Pelley, Cecilia Vega, Bill Whitaker, and Jon Wertheim openly complained about Weiss’s \"outsider arrogance.\"\n\n\"They think she’s questioning their integrity, and their legacy,\" another staffer huffed.","summary":"Bari Weiss was brought aboard the network for her moderate and centrist views.","url":"https://radaronline.com/p/cbs-news-boss-bari-weiss-trump-60-minutes-interview-settlement/","image":"https://media.radaronline.com/brand-img/8N1T0hIxv/0x0/bari-weiss-donald-trump-1762209420663.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-03 23:50:00","author":"Daniel Gura","authors":["Daniel Gura"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.422},{"id":375450230,"title":"Leaked Dossier Accuses BBC Of Doctoring Trump’s January 6 Speech In Documentary: REPORT","text":"The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) program “Panorama” allegedly misled viewers by airing an edited version of President Donald Trump’s Jan. 6, 2021, speech in 2024 calling for his supporters to protest Congress certifying the electoral votes for the 2020 election, The Telegraph reported Monday.\n\nThe 19-page dossier, authored by Michael Prescott, a former external advisor to the network’s Editorial Guidelines and Standards Committee, detailed bias in the state-supported broadcaster’s coverage of multiple issues, according to The Telegraph. Senior officials at the BBC have reportedly not responded to the concerns raised in the dossier, while unidentified “managers” refused to admit that “a breach of standards” occurred, The Telegraph reported. (RELATED: CBS ‘Race And Culture’ Unit Dies Swift Death As Outlet Sheds Jobs Under Bari Weiss)\n\n“The spliced together version of Trump’s comments aired by Panorama made it seem that he said: ‘We’re gonna walk down to the Capitol and I’ll be with you and we fight. We fight like hell and if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not gonna have a country anymore,’” the dossier stated about “Panorama’s” depiction of Trump’s address on the Ellipse of the White House.\n\n“While we don’t comment on leaked documents, when the BBC receives feedback it takes it seriously and considers it carefully,” a BBC spokesperson told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “Michael Prescott is a former adviser to a board committee where differing views and opinions of our coverage are routinely discussed and debated.”\n\nTrump’s actual remarks were far different than what aired on the BBC program, according to a transcript of the speech on NPR’s website..\n\n“We’re going to walk down to the Capitol, and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women,” Trump said, according to the transcript.\n\nTelegraph associate editor Gordon Rayner broke down how the video was edited to present the appearance that Trump endorsed the riot in a video posted by the newspaper on YouTube in which he held up a copy of the dossier, noting that the first part of the statement the BBC aired took place at 12:16 p.m. Eastern time.\n\n“Trump didn’t, in fact, say this at all,” Rayner said in the video after replaying the BBC’s clip. “The BBC spliced together two clips that took place 54 minutes apart.”\n\n“It wasn’t until nearly an hour later that he then said the second part of the BBC’s version,” Rayner added later after playing the clip and demonstrating the cut. Rayner then fast-forwarded, showing that the second part of the clip the BBC aired was from remarks made at 1:10 p.m. Eastern time.\n\n“Trust in the media is at an all-time low because of deceptive editing, misleading reporting, and outright lies,” White House deputy press secretary Abigail Jackson told the DCNF. “This is yet another example, of many, highlighting why countless Americans turn to alternative media sources to get their news.”\n\nTrump has won settlements from media outlets over their coverage of him. He secured a $15 million settlement with ABC in December 2024 after he sued the outlet on March 19, 2024, for defamation over “This Week” host George Stephanopoulos falsely saying Trump was found “liable for rape” during a contentious March 10, 2024, appearance by Republican Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina.\n\n 🔴 An internal BBC whistleblower memo seen by The Telegraph says a Panorama programme “completely misled” viewers by editing @realDonaldTrump‘s speech to make it seem like he encouraged the Capitol riot Full details and video from Gordon Rayner here ⬇️https://t.co/NUVYDQkjJH pic.twitter.com/n6P92DAIjh — The Telegraph (@Telegraph) November 3, 2025 \n\nParamount announced it had settled a $10 billion lawsuit filed by Trump over the editing of an October 2024 interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris, who was Trump’s opponent in the 2024 presidential election, on “60 Minutes” on July 2.\n\nThe BBC also came under fire for its Arabic-language reporting on the Israeli operations in Gaza following the Oct. 7, 2023, attack by the radical Islamic terrorist group Hamas that killed over 1,200 people in Israel, and for “censorship” on coverage of transgender issues.

Nor will California choose a new governor.\n\nBut voters will go to the polls Tuesday in California and dozens of other states, deciding everything from local tax measures to high-profile races that could impact national politics. In short, Tuesday is the most significant election in the United states since last November, experts say, when President Trump defeated the Bay Area’s Kamala Harris in the presidential race, and Republicans maintained control of the House and Senate. It’s also being viewed as a way to gauge the pulse of voters a year before the 2026 elections, when control of the House, Senate and governor’s offices will be up for grabs.\n\n“Tuesday has become an early referendum on Trump,” said Larry Gerston, a professor emeritus of political science at San Jose State University. “There are different states, different turnouts and different issues. But that’s the overall theme.”\n\nA CNN poll Monday showed voters aren’t happy. Trump’s approval rating was 37% — the lowest of his second term. A majority of voters said his polices have worsened the economy, hurt America’s standing in the world, and that his immigration crackdown has “gone too far.” But the same voters had an even lower view of the Democratic Party, giving it just a 29% approval rating.\n\nFive key races to watch Tuesday:\n\n1) Proposition 50\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom’s statewide ballot measure, if approved by voters, would redraw California’s congressional districts in a way that could cost five Republicans their seats, tilting the state’s delegation from the current 43 Democrats and 9 Republicans to 48-4 after next year’s elections. Newsom and Sacramento Democrats placed the measure on the ballot after Trump pushed governors in red states, including Texas, to redraw their district lines this year, instead of every 10 years after the Census, as had been the custom, in an attempt to boost Republicans’ chances of keeping control of the House of Representatives next year.\n\nIf Democrats win the House in 2026, they could impeach Trump again, haul his cabinet secretaries under oath before investigations, and block funding for everything from new offshore oil drilling to expanded immigration detention centers. Republicans led by former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger — who worked hard to create California’s non-partisan commission that draws district lines — have fought Prop 50. But Democrats have outraised opponents $122 million to $44 million. Polls show the measure leading in California, a state Trump lost by 20 points last November. If it passes, Newsom’s national profile as a 2028 presidential candidate will be boosted.\n\n2) Virginia\n\nRepublican Gov. Glenn Youngkin will leave office due to term limits in this purple state. Former congresswoman Abigail Spanberger, a moderate Democrat and former CIA agent who has focused on cost-of-living issues, is running to succeed him against Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, a Trump supporter and former Marine. Spanberger is leading in the polls, particularly as the federal government shutdown has hit Virginia residents hard. Whoever wins will be the first female governor in Virginia history.\n\nA big question mark: Whether Democrat Jay Jones can hang on to beat Republican incumbent Jason Miyares in the attorney general’s race. Jones led until last month. But the National Review published text messages Jones sent to a fellow state lawmaker wishing a Republican state leader and his family would die. Jones also was cited in 2022 for driving 116 mph. As part of a plea deal, he performed 500 hours of community service for his own political action committee. His image and poll numbers have suffered.\n\n3) New Jersey\n\nThe other marquee governor’s race Tuesday is in the Garden State, where a close battle is playing out. Democrat Mikie Sherrill, a four-term member of Congress and former Navy helicopter pilot, faces Republican Jack Ciattarelli, a former state Assemblyman who came within 3 points of defeating incumbent Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy in 2021.\n\nA normally reliable blue state that has voted for the Democratic nominee for president in every election since 1992, New Jersey has occasionally elected Republicans as governor, most recently Chris Christie in 2009 and 2013. Sherrill holds a narrow lead in the polls. But Harris only defeated Trump there in November by 5.9%, and Ciattarelli, with Trump’s backing and solid fundraising, is looking for a breakthrough win.\n\n4) New York City\n\nThree candidates are vying to run America’s most populous city: Former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, 67, a Democrat who won four statewide elections, only to resign his Albany office in 2021 amid sexual harassment allegations; Republican Curtis Sliwa, 71, who founded the Guardian Angels crimefighting group; and state lawmaker Zohran Mamdani, a 34-year-old Democratic Socialist who has built momentum with charismatic speeches, clever social media and promises to raise taxes on billionaires, provide free bus service and a pass a $30 minimum wage. Mamdani, a darling of progressives nationwide, is leading in the polls, even though many traditional Democratic leaders, including Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, have not endorsed him or Cuomo.\n\n5) Pennsylvania\n\nFew states are more important in winning the presidency than Pennsylvania. After voting for Obama twice, Keystone State voters shifted to Trump in 2016, embraced Joe Biden in 2020, and veered back to Trump last year, awarding him their 19 electoral votes.\n\nDemocrats hold a 5-2 majority on the state Supreme Court. Three Democratic justices — David Wecht, Christine Donohue and Kevin Dougherty — face yes-no retention votes, in which voters will decide whether to keep them on the bench. Republicans are pushing hard to remove them, which would shift the court to a 2-2 tie before elections in 2027 add new members. A deadlocked chamber could have major impacts on the 2028 presidential race if disputes over voting, ballot counting or other elections questions make it to Pennsylvania’s highest court.","summary":"From California's Prop 50 to the New York City mayor's race, significant contests are up for grabs Tuesday","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/11/03/election-day-2025-the-five-biggest-races-to-watch/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/SJM-L-Election-2025-Redistricting-California_246257748.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-03 23:17:41","author":"Paul Rogers","authors":["Paul Rogers"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.006},{"id":375444874,"title":"SCHILLING: Why Democrats Are Struggling in Virginia and New Jersey","text":"Why are Democrats struggling to close out what should be straightforward victories?\n\nBetween the gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia, Democrats are expected to spend well over $100 million to hold back Republicans. This level of spending is extraordinary for races that should be easy wins because, historically, off-year gubernatorial races favor the party out of power. If Winsome Earle-Sears wins in Virginia, she would be only the second candidate to buck this trend in over 50 years.\n\nThe answer lies in their embrace of extremist positions on parental rights in education, their support for policies allowing biological men in girls’ private spaces, and their backing of taxpayer-funded medical interventions for gender-confused minors—all to appease their progressive base.\n\nPast Is Prologue\n\nThe 2021 Virginia gubernatorial race should have been a wake-up call for Democrats. Terry McAuliffe was coasting to victory until he made a fatal mistake during a debate. “I don’t think parents should be telling schools what to teach!” he declared. These words resonated—and not in a good way—particularly with suburban women in Northern Virginia who typically vote Democrat.\n\nCNN focus groups revealed that these remarks made traditional Democrat voters feel excluded from decisions about their own children’s education. McAuliffe’s statement suggested parents didn’t even deserve a seat at the table. It cost him the race.\n\nBut instead of learning from this disaster, Democrats in Virginia and New Jersey have staked out positions that are even more extreme.\n\n2025 Democrats Are Even More Extreme\n\nWhile McAuliffe didn’t think parents should tell schools what to teach, the current Democrat nominees—Abigail Spanberger in Virginia and Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey—don’t believe parents should even know what schools are teaching their children.\n\nBoth candidates voted against the Parental Bill of Rights, a straightforward education transparency measure that would simply inform parents about curriculum content in taxpayer-funded public schools. This isn’t about parental control over curriculum—it’s about basic transparency and the right to know what your tax dollars are funding and what your children are being taught.\n\nHow could anyone vote against transparency? The answer becomes clear when you recognize that these candidates answer primarily to teachers’ union leadership like Randi Weingarten and the American Federation of Teachers, rather than to parents themselves.\n\nDemocrats’ positions on biological males in women’s private spaces have created another significant vulnerability. Consider the case of Richard Cox, a convicted sex offender in Arlington County, Virginia. Cox, who identifies as a woman, has repeatedly been found in women’s showers and locker rooms, including incidents involving exposure to young girls. Under policies passed by Democrats in Arlington—policies that both Spanberger and Sherrill support not just locally but nationally—Cox has been granted access to these spaces.\n\nThis isn’t a theoretical debate. It’s happening in communities right now. And if parents object to these policies, they risk being labeled as bigots who oppose civil rights. \n\nBut perhaps most concerning is both candidates’ support for providing gender-transition medical procedures to minors, including puberty blockers and surgeries, funded by taxpayer dollars.\n\nPolling consistently shows that voters across the political spectrum oppose these interventions for children. After all, minors cannot legally get tattoos, sign contracts, or make other permanent decisions about their bodies. The idea that children should receive sterilizing medical procedures before they’re old enough to understand the lifelong consequences strikes most Americans as reckless.\n\nMoreover, voters overwhelmingly oppose using tax dollars to fund transition procedures for anyone—adults included. The position that sex-change procedures should be banned for minors and not taxpayer-funded for individuals of any age represents the mainstream American view. Yet Sherrill and Spanberger have chosen to align themselves with the fringe minority position.\n\nDemocrat Extremism Hurts Their Election Chances\n\nAt American Principles Project PAC, we’ve spent over $2.4 million in these races ensuring voters understand where these candidates stand. Our investment is based on solid data showing these issues significantly impact voter behavior.\n\nOur randomized control trials reveal an 8.7-point shift toward Republicans when voters learn Mikie Sherrill supports taxpayer-funded sex changes for minors. There’s a 5.7-point shift in Virginia when they discover the Democrat supports biological men in women’s private spaces. Even learning about opposition to parental rights in education produces a 2.7-point Republican shift in Virginia.\n\nIn an era when elections are often decided by razor-thin margins, it’s political malpractice for Democrats to maintain these unpopular positions.\n\nRepublicans aren’t alone in warning Democrats about the political costs of these stances. Shortly after the 2024 election, Blueprint, a Democrat messaging firm, released a report finding that Kamala Harris’s support for transgender issues was the top reason swing voters chose Trump. A more recent analysis by Welcome, another Democrat strategy group, reached similar conclusions.\n\nThe data is clear: These positions are electoral poison. Yet Democrat candidates continue embracing them, prioritizing the demands of progressive activists and teachers’ unions over the concerns of parents and the common sense of voters.\n\nThe Stakes: Democrats Will Declare Victory in Culture War\n\nIf Tuesday’s results favor Democrats despite their extreme positions on these issues, expect the party’s progressive wing to claim vindication and push even harder on gender ideology. They’ll argue that concerns about parental rights and protecting children are overblown.\n\nBut if Republicans succeed or keep the races closer than expected—against all historical trends—it will be because Democrats chose to alienate parents, dismiss common sense concerns about child safety, and place ideology above the interests of families.\n\nAt its core, this extremism reflects a profound disdain for families and for parents who have been entrusted with protecting their children. And that disdain is proving to be a decisive political liability.\n\nAs someone committed to electing more Republicans, I certainly hope Democrats continue down this path. But for the sake of children and families, I hope parents continue making their voices heard at the ballot box.\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

Though we are still a year away from the vital 2026 midterm congressional elections, there are still a number of races garnering national attention for one reason or another.\n\nWill President Donald Trump’s 2024 red shift in blue states continue? Will the Democratic Party lurch further to the Left?\n\nHere is a quick preview of what races to watch on Tuesday.\n\nMinneapolis Mayor Race\n\nTwo mayor races have become prominent in this election cycle. While Minneapolis perhaps doesn’t quite reach the level of attention of a New York City, it has its own version of Zohran Mamdani who looks to pull the Democratic Party even further to the Left.\n\nThe city’s ranked-choice voting system has ensured that the top two candidates will be Democrats. The first is incumbent Mayor Jacob Frey, a man who already veers far to the Left and was an enthusiastic supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement when the city was hit by riots in the summer of 2020.\n\nChallenging him is democratic socialist Omar Fateh, the son of Somali immigrants who became the first Muslim to serve in the Minnesota Senate after his victory in the 2020 election.\n\nMy colleague, Tyler O’Neil, wrote about Fateh in his preview of the mayor’s race:\n\nA self-declared democratic socialist and a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, Fateh is running on a platform of raising taxes “to ensure the wealthy pay their fair share.” He champions “environmental justice.” … The state senator seems to be leveraging the influence of the small but influential Somali Muslim community in Minneapolis. The Minnesota insider described the Somali community as a “very important voting bloc” that is “not the majority” of the city but extremely influential. Members of this community reportedly went to train with the terrorist group al Shabaab in Somalia and the Islamic State, but law enforcement has partnered with the community to oppose radicalism.\n\nNYC Mayor Race\n\nIt’s rare that a mayor’s race garners so much national attention, but this is a big one in the Big Apple.\n\nIn one corner, you have 34-year-old New York Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America who ran a successful insurgent campaign in the Democrat primary. He’s been the frontrunner since his June victory.\n\nIn the other corners are Andrew Coumo, the former governor of New York who was defeated in the Democrat primary and now is running an independent campaign, and Curtis Sliwa, the Republican. Sliwa is the founder of the Guardian Angels, an anti-crime organization started in the late 1970s.\n\nMamdani staked out a position of resistance to President Donald Trump and federal immigration law enforcement. His platform leads with his message about housing being too expensive and offers mostly government solutions to the problem which boils down to tax the rich, tax the whites in a city held to be the financial capital of the United States. Not only that, but he’s also made himself cozy with radical Islamists and refused to condemn the phrase, “globalize the Intifada.”\n\nRep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., who has entered what’s looking like a close race for New York governor in 2026 commented on Mamdani’s unseemly connections.\n\nCuomo has taken up the position as the experienced choice who knows how to govern and has condemned Mamdani’s radicalism.\n\nSliva has maintained that he is the true anti-Mamdani choice and is the only candidate who has been consistently serious about stopping and preventing crime in the city.\n\nRecent polls show that the race may be tightening, though many polls also showed Cuomo winning the primary. One way or another, what happens in the New York mayor’s race will have repercussions not just for the city but the country.\n\nNew Jersey Governor Race\n\nFew states shifted more dramatically to the right in 2024 than New Jersey. While the Garden State still ended up casting its electoral college votes for former Vice President Kamala Harris, the dramatic voter shift was notable. Is New Jersey a purple state now? Is it maybe even leaning red?\n\nThose are the questions looking to be answered in the New Jersey governor’s race where Democrat Mikie Sherrill and Republican Jack Ciattarelli face off to replace Gov. Phil Murphy who is being term-limited out of office. Ciattarelli came close to beating Murphy in the last election.\n\nMost polls show that Sherrill leads Ciattarelli, but the race has tightened considerably since it began. According to RealClearPolling, Sherrill began with a 21-point lead in June, but current polling averages show an under four-point separation between the candidates.\n\nThe race has been close enough that even former President Barack Obama went on the campaign trail to help Sherrill over the finish line.\n\nOhio Republican gubernatorial candidate Vivek Ramaswamy came out to help Ciattarelli.\n\n“New Jersey is a state with a lot of Republicans who just don’t know yet that they’re actually Republicans,” Ramaswamy said when visiting in mid-October. \n\nVirginia AG Race\n\nThe Virginia attorney general race has become one of national importance not just because Virginia is a key electoral battleground, but because of a singular issue that has changed the race.\n\nDemocrat Jay Jones, who is challenging incumbent Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares, came under scrutiny after a series of his texts were published by National Review where he said he wanted the former Republican speaker of the Virginia House and his children to be shot.\n\nThe texts were from 2022 but surfaced not long after the assassination of Charlie Kirk. Despite calls for Jones to leave the race, he apologized and decided to continue his campaign. Virginia Democrats have refused to call for Jones to abandon the race.\n\nAccording to polls, Miyares opened up a significant lead over Jones after the texts surfaced and maintains that lead into election day.\n\nThere are two major questions about this race heading into election day. What can be expected of an elected official who has wished violent death on his opponents once he’s in office? That Jones trails badly in the race may resolve that issue, but another question is whether his comments will drag down the rest of the Democrat ticket.\n\nVirginia Governor Race\n\nThe race for Virginia governor is shaping up to be a possible bellwether for the 2026 midterms, so it’s received a great deal of attention.\n\nRepublican Gov. Glenn Younkin was ineligible to run due to Virginia’s unique ban on consecutive terms for governor. Set to replace him are his Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears or Democrat candidate Abigail Spanberger.\n\nSpanberger is a congresswoman and a former CIA agent. She’s been leading in the polls throughout the race, but her lead has narrowed in recent days. This is likely in part due to the aforementioned attorney general race.\n\nSpanberger has run as a defender of federal employees, an issue particularly salient in the northern Virginia suburbs of Washington. But she’s been unwilling to address major issues that Earle-Sears has campaigned on. The first is the issue of transgender ideology, which in part vaulted Youngkin to office in 2021. Spanberger has essentially punted on the issue and refuses to address it.\n\nThe second issue is the comments by Jones. Not only has she continued to support Jones, but she refused to engage Earle-Sears on the issue when it came up during their October debate.","summary":"Election Day is upon us.

What? \"We don't know if Trump used an autopen to pardon,\" Goldberg said as she read it. 'It was a joke!' \n\n'Yes, we don’t know whether Trump used an autopen to pardon-' replied Hostin, a legal expert, as Goldberg continued to complain.\n\n'Oh, come on!' Goldberg said, before ripping the note to shreds.\n\n'Well, I’m sorry. The hardest thing about this job now is no one understands nuance. \n\n'You know when you hear a joke, when somebody’s fooling around, when they’re not saying something specific.

But We Need a New Nominee\", Clooney wrote that the ageing president had won many battles in his career \"but the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time\".\n\nClooney's comments come after the former president's son, Hunter Biden, lashed out at him for questioning his father's mental sharpness.\n\nLess than a fortnight after Clooney's op-ed, Biden announced he would step aside for Harris.\n\nIn his interview with CBS, the actor said that he would write it again, adding: \"We had a chance.\"\n\n\"I wanted there to be, as I wrote in the op-ed, a primary.

same man we all witnessed at the debate,\" Clooney said, in reference to Biden's disastrous TV debate against Trump weeks before, which fuelled new concerns about the 81-year-old's and fitness for office.\n\nIn an expletive-filled interview with the YouTube outlet Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan, Hunter Biden accused Clooney of exaggerating the former president's frailty.\n\nAsked why Clooney had intervened in the race, Hunter Biden responded with a succession of profanities about the actor.\n\n\"What do you have to do with… anything?\" he said in a message directed at Clooney. \"Why do I

a political candidate will be assassinated within 5 years, poll finds","text":"Americans are worried about a potential spike in political violence in the coming years, with majorities expecting such attacks to increase, while more than half of Americans told pollsters they expect a political candidate to get assassinated within the next five years.\n\nFears of rising violence are bipartisan, a new poll from Politico and Public First found, with 53 percent of 2024 Kamala Harris voters and 51 percent of Trump voters expecting an assassination soon.\n\nAround 61 percent of recent Harris voters and 50 percent of recent Trump voters foresee a spike in violence overall.\n\nThe poll, taken after the September assassination of conservative political activist Charlie Kirk, reflects a national mood that’s both concerned about — and, to a degree, accepting of — political violence.\n\nThe Politico poll also found that 24 percent of respondents think political violence is sometimes justified, a figure that jumps to more than one-third for those under age 45.\n\nThe results are similar to an October NPR / PBS News / Marist poll, which found that 28 percent of Democrats and 31 percent of Republicans thought political violence might be necessary to “get the country back on track.”\n\nBetween the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol and the 2024 election, there were at least 300 cases of political violence, a 2024 Reuters analysis found, the largest surge in such attacks since the 1970s. \n\nTargets have included politicians and officials tied to both parties, ranging from multiple shooting attempts against Trump during the 2024 campaign, to a firebombing attack in April on the Democratic Governor of Pennsylvania, Josh Shapiro. \n\nSince 2016, there were nearly three times as many partisan-driven attacks and plots in the U.S. as in the previous quarter-century, a 2023 Center for Strategic and International Studies paper concluded.\n\nWhile the Trump administration has been quick to blame the left for the trend, the nature of the problem is far more nuanced than that, Shane Burley, an author and journalist who writes about fascism and right-wing political movements, recently told The Independent.\n\nHe pointed to a variety of “profound social changes” as driving the surge, including deep partisanship, economic dispossession, ideological and geographic segregation, virulent online conspiracy theories, poor mental health infrastructure, and dissolving social structures such as unions.\n\nThere’s also been an injection of violence directly into our political process itself, whether it’s the Trump administration sending masked ICE agents and National Guardsmen into largely Democratic cities to carry out immigration enforcement, or the increasingly common presence of armed militiamen and ideological street gangs at protests.\n\n“People engage in violence when they are not part of a stable social system,” Burley told The Independent.\n\n“Gun violence is really a symptom of a real larger social problem that you’re going to have to deal with holistically, and that’s really unfortunate because we are nowhere near dealing with those problems in a holistic way.”\n\nLeft-wing attacks and plots have been on the rise recently, though a large body of research shows that right-wing extremists and jihadists have killed far more people than those associated with any other political cause in the U.S. since 9/11. \n\nComplicating matters further, many incidents don’t map neatly onto one political ideology, especially given the frequent presence of mental health crises among those who commit such acts.","summary":"Nearly a quarter of respondents also said political violence can be justified in some

A fleet of giant-ass sattelites at L1 could reduce incident light on the earth by some fraction of a percent and make no noticeable difference to the appearance of the sun, because at that distance they'd be too small to percieve. You'd just get a coresponding [fraction of a percent] drop in brightness.\n\nEven at LEO altitudes you could have shades whipping around that you could not percieve because of the relative sizes involved. (Now, half of their orbit would be wasted so I you'd have to weigh other factors in you mission design, whatever.)\n\nThere are all sorts of arguments about this not being a good idea for other reasons that should be discussed.

Space is really rather big\n\n/you might think its a long way down to the shops\n//but thats just peanuts to space\n\nSpace is big, but low-earth orbit not so much. There's already a huge problem with space junk. The worst case is the so-called Kessler Syndrome, where collisions generate random pieces of junk that cause other collisions in a chain reaction sort of way.\n\n(1) Funniest\n\n39 minutes ago\n\nMusicMakeMyHeadPound: One would think it would just be easier to reign in carbon emissions, but...\n\nI mean let's see. Regular satellites that aren't there specifically to block a lot of energy, get stable around 1000km. I would suspect that having a purpose of blocking all that energy, where at the point it needs to be blocked it is receiving an average of 1,366 watts per meter, which is reduced to an average of 342watts when it hits the surface of the earth. That means you're not just worried about drag when you have something with massive panels meant to block the sun, you're worried about Newton's third law of physics. That much energy hitting, has to go somewhere - think about movies you've watched where someone is doing a space walk and pushes against something much larger, and the larger thing moves a little and the astronaut moves a lot; the energy equals out. So that 1366watts of energy? Has a simple foot-pounds/second conversion. It's a simple conversion, but too much physics for me to remember anymore since it's been a couple decades. Anyway, that energy pushes the shields, which means they can't just be 1000km out, they have to be far enough out that they risk going further by mass, but reach an equalibrium based on all the forces involved. It's going to be much further than 1000km. 10,000km? 20,000km? I have zero idea, but for funsies let's go with 5000km.\n\nAverage radius of the earth is 6,753km. Add 5,000, you're at 11,753km radius. That means you have a sphere of 1,735,830,585km^2. To reduce the solar energy by 0.01%, you'd have to create a shield 173,583km^2 in size. I don't have any idea how much energy you'd need to block, I know the Earth generates some of its own heat, and I know the concern is reducing the addition caused by the blanket effect of CO2-equivs.\n\nI guess the point is you'd have to make a REALLY FARKING HUGE SHIELD to block even 0.01% of the solar radiation, and getting all that up there? generates heat. Do we even have enough materials to get that much stuff up there? And now we have a large mass of crap up there to avoid, worse than we already have. And then yeah, don't like a country? Turn their lights out. Or shift the shields to also be reflectors (they'd likely be anyway) and you could use it as a solar lazer to a degree, raising your favorite location a 100C just for fun. There are so many reasons not to do such a stupid thing, really, and even if everyone was perfect, everyone did things with honesty and integrity, the resources required to do such a thing would be more than the resources to just farking turn many of those same materials into solar panels and reduce greenhouse gases while making energy available for other things. The resources involved in launching that many materials into orbit, could be much more efficiently used in carbon sequestering, re-establishing the Amazon, whatever. It's a profoundly stupid and wasteful idea, and elmo only posits it because he's got the biggest rockets around, and it gets people to approach him as long-term private investors.\n\n(2) Funniest\n\n38 minutes ago\n\nI think the best solution to Global Warming is to line up all the Billionaires and Oil Executives and run them through the Guilotine.

Space is really rather big\n\n/you might think its a long way down to the shops\n//but thats just peanuts to space\n\nWhen a satellite breaks up but is still in orbit, it makes all these little bits and pieces that create a really horrible hazard. You only need to punch a single tiny hole in most things flying around up there, to make them worthless. As someone who has seen a pencil stuck in a telephone pole after a hurricane, a pebble hitting the space station could be catastrophic.

The mass affects the gravitational pull, then the speed needs to counter that pull to keep it always in a state of pulling away exactly as much as it is pulling toward, to maintain orbit.\n\nMy understanding is that for two objects with the same mass, yes, they'd need the same speed to maintain that orbit. But the implication here is that one object has exponentially less mass and, having been a part of something that broke up, is losing orbit thus it isn't going the necessary speed anymore. That could take a thousand years to happen however, plenty of time to punch a hole in something.\n\nBut again, my orbital mechanics knowledge is a bit rusty, being something I was marginally interested in sometime in the end of the last millennium.\n\n(0) Funniest\n\n12 minutes ago\n\ndrewsclues: baron von doodle: In the next decade or so, we're going to really regret letting any asshole with money pollute Earth's orbit.

'Narcissistic' Donald Trump, 79, Brags He's 'Better Looking' Than 'Democratic Socialist' NYC Mayor Frontrunner, 34, During Bizarre Rant ","text":"Donald Trump has been slammed as \"delusional\" after he called himself better looking than New York Mayoral candidate and heartthrob Zohran Mamdani, RadarOnline.com can report. \n\nThe president, who has a 45-year age gap on the Democratic frontrunner, also continued his labeling of the frontrunner a \"communist.\"'60 Minutes' Sit-DownDuring his wide-ranging interview with 60 Minutes, Trump was asked about this week's mayoral election in New York City.\n\nTrump slammed that Mamdani, 34, is \"a communist, not a socialist. He’s far worse than a socialist.\"\n\nCorrespondent Norah O'Donnell followed up with a compliment to Trump, telling the president, \"Some people have compared (Mamdani) to a left-wing version of you: charismatic, breaking the old rules. What do you think about that?\"\n\nTrump replied matter-of-factly: \"Well, I think I'm a much better-looking person than him, right?\"Social UpheavalO'Donnell had no response. But plenty of people in a Reddit chat room let their opinions be known. \n\n\"The level of delusion is unfathomable,\" one person raged, as another blasted, \"The dementia is really kicking in now.\"\n\nA third person said: \"Politics aside, even at his youngest and best looking, he was still far uglier than Mamdani. Mamdani is a legit cutie.\"One person commented: \"That's the President of the United States talking like a freaking jilted teenage girl,\" as another referenced the president's recent controversial destruction of the East Wing of the White House, \"Have they destroyed all reflective surfaces in the White House as well?\"\n\nAnd a user exclaimed: \"Older folk who compare themselves to people less than half their age are strange!!!! Trump is more than double Mamdani's age. Go away, Grandpa!\"Trump vs. CBSTrump's 60 Minutes interview came under further scrutiny not for what he said, but for what the network edited out. Among the topics the news magazine cut from the story that aired was a discussion about CBS's $16million settlement with Trump. \n\nThe controversial politician previously sued CBS over the editing of a 60 Minutes interview with then-Vice President Harris, which he claimed had been edited to help her chances in the presidential election after she took over for Joe Biden.\n\nAt the beginning of Sunday's interview, O'Donnell told viewers Paramount had settled the lawsuit, but made clear \"the settlement did not include an apology or admission of wrongdoing.\"\n\nHowever, only people who looked up the extended transcript of the interview online read Trump say. \"Actually, 60 Minutes paid me a lotta money. And you don’t have to put this on, because I don't wanna embarrass you, and I'm sure you're not. \n\n\"But 60 Minutes was forced to pay me a lot of money because they took (Kamala Harris') answer out that was so bad, it was election-changing, two nights before the election. And they put a new answer in. And they paid me a lot of money for that. You can't have fake news. You've gotta have legit news. And I think that it's happening.\"Trump's Extended Interview Raises More QuestionsFollowing the aired interview, CBS released an extended 73-minute cut online, a clip which was also shared by the White House's RapidResponse 47 X account. However, neither version appeared to contain Trump raging over questions about Changpeng 'CZ' Zhao, the billionaire he pardoned after a $2billion crypto deal was struck with the Trump family, as again was detailed in the transcript.\n\nIn the aired version, Trump claimed he had \"no idea\" who the billionaire was, and added, \"I know he got a four-month sentence or something like that, and I heard it was a Biden witch hunt...\"\n\nAccording to the X account, the clip was the \"FULL\" 60 Minutes interview \"without the network's edits and cuts.\" An editor's note on the news show's YouTube upload of the extended interview explained it was \"condensed for clarity.\" \n\nWhile the intense exchange between Trump and O'Donnell did not appear on the edited or \"full\" versions, it was included in the transcript.","summary":"The president, who has a 45-year age gap on the Democratic frontrunner, also called him a 'communist.'","url":"https://radaronline.com/p/trump-better-looking-socialist-nyc-mayor-zohran-mamdani/","image":"https://media.radaronline.com/brand-img/9tK4YkgX5/0x0/donald-trump-zohran-mamdani-1762201525575.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-03 21:15:00","author":"Daniel Gura","authors":["Daniel Gura"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.234},{"id":375429258,"title":"The Hill Traffic Surges Nearly 50% Amid Government Shutdown","text":"Homepage for The Hill\n\nAs the federal government shutdown continues into its second month, The Hill says it’s seeing a surge in readership as the digital news brand delivers nonstop coverage from inside the Beltway.\n\nAccording to internal Chartbeat data, the site’s estimated traffic for October was up nearly 50% month-over-month, with shutdown coverage and politics-driven exclusives resulting in millions of page views. To cite just one indicator of reader interest: On the last day of September, with the shutdown looming the next day, The Hill’s number of unique visitors was up 93% compared to the previous day — and a staggering 250% over the previous Tuesday.\n\nFor now, that data is only a ballpark, as sites like it await the availability of detailed metrics for October in the coming days. That trend shouldn’t come as a surprise, though, with the full data likely to reflect similar bumps in online traffic from publishers like Politico, CNN, and FoxNews.com as audiences continue to seek out reporting on the shutdown’s effects across the country.\n\nAs for The Hill, specifically, readers coming to it since the shutdown began have found coverage of topics including the shutdown’s impact on federal food aid, which affects the ability of millions of people to pay for groceries; the impact on the National Flood Insurance Program and its ability to issue new policies or renewals; a look at the Food and Drug Administration needing to pause new drug applications; and insight into the operational impact of the shutdown, such as the effect on air traffic controllers who’ve been working without pay.\n\n“It’s not surprising that readers seeking information about the government shutdown would turn to The Hill, where we pride ourselves on in-depth, non-partisan coverage of Congress,” said Bill Sammon, SVP of Washington, D.C. editorial content for The Hill and NewsNation. “It also helps that we continue to break exclusive, deeply reported stories that advance the narrative in ways that help readers make sense of what's happening on Capitol Hill.”\n\nThe site’s recent performance, by the way, comes as 2025 has already been a banner year for the politics-focused news brand.\n\nThe Hill garnered more than 617 million sites visits, an average of 68.6 million on a monthly basis, between January and September (according to Comscore MMX Multi-platform data). During October alone, The Hill was up almost 50 percent on a pageview basis compared to September, with the site racking up millions of views by the second day of the shutdown.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nAll of that followed a busy, news-filled summer for The Hill — examples of which included the site’s national political reporter Julia Manchester revealing that Congresswoman Elise Stefanik was preparing to launch her campaign for New York governor.\n\nSenior politics reporter Amie Parnes, meanwhile, scored two interviews with California Governor Gavin Newsom regarding his thoughts on the direction of the Democratic Party and California’s redistricting battle against President Trump. Parnes also spoke with sources in June who clarified rumors about former Vice President Kamala Harris joining California’s gubernatorial race in 2026.\n\nExamples like those and others very much serve as a reminder that politics and especially political gridlock in Washington remain among the most reliable audience magnets in digital media.\n\nTraffic spikes like The Hill’s, by the way, also come against the backdrop of a federal shutdown now just days away from breaking the record for the longest in U.S. history — that previous record being the 35-day shutdown during the first Trump administration, lasting from Dec. 22, 2018, to Jan. 25, 2019.\n\nEditorial StandardsReprints & Permissions","summary":"As the federal government shutdown stretches into its second month, The Hill is coming off of a 50% traffic surge fueled by shutdown and politics coverage.","url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/andymeek/2025/11/03/the-hill-traffic-surges-nearly-50-amid-government-shutdown/","image":"https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6908f34b98069cfe4696260f/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-03 21:06:14","author":"Andy Meek,Senior Contributor","authors":["Andy Meek","Senior Contributor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.126},{"id":375437138,"title":"Chuck Schumer suggests filing FCC complaint for Trump's 'unhinged' '60 Minutes' interview","text":"Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., responded to President Donald Trump's \"60 Minutes\" interview with what appeared to be a legal threat in an X post earlier Monday morning. Trump appeared on the CBS news program for the first time since settling his lawsuit with CBS' parent company Paramount on Sunday night. The sit-down interview was also Trump's first time on \"60 Minutes\" since Oct. 2020, ahead of the presidential election. Schumer called the interview \"unhinged\" and suggested that he would file a complaint with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) over the episode's editing. HOW TRUMP SUED CBS AND WON: THE '60 MINUTES' SETTLEMENT THAT ROCKED THE MEDIA WORLD, EXPLAINED \"Maybe I should file a complaint with the FCC against the Trump White House for editing his unhinged 60 Minutes interview. It will use the exact same language Trump lodged against Vice President Harris,\" Schumer wrote. Schumer's post seemed to be in reference to Trump's original lawsuit against CBS News, in which he accused the company of deceptively editing a 2024 \"60 Minutes\" interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris, ahead of the presidential election. However, Trump did not file an FCC complaint at the time, though he called for the network to lose its broadcasting license over the issue. The FCC complaint was filed by the Center for American Rights, which argued that CBS News' editing decisions \"amount to deliberate news distortion\" and violated FCC rules. TRUMP TAUNTS '60 MINUTES' DURING INTERVIEW, SAYS SHOW PAID HIM 'A LOT OF MONEY' Fox News Digital reached out to Schumer's office and Paramount for comment. Both Harris and CBS News were mocked by conservatives after it appeared that the network shortened a lengthy \"word-salad\" response from Harris that aired on \"Face the Nation\" to a more focused and condensed answer that aired on a special edition of \"60 Minutes.\" CBS News denied that it took part in \"deceitful editing\" of the interview in a statement more than a week later. \"60 Minutes gave an excerpt of our interview to ‘Face the Nation’ that used a longer section of her answer than that on 60 Minutes. Same question. Same answer. But a different portion of the response,\" the statement read. '60 MINUTES' STAFF READY TO MOVE FORWARD FROM PARAMOUNT-TRUMP SETTLEMENT, BUT CONCERNS CARRY ON Trump sued CBS News for $10 billion in damages, later raising the figure to $20 billion, accusing the network of \"deceptive doctoring\" in favor of Harris. Paramount later agreed to a $16 million settlement in July.

And it doesn’t get much better than a mayor’s race in New York that could determine if socialist progressive insurgent Zohran Mamdani can have a clear mandate to govern, two moderate Democratic congresswomen can win governorships in states chock full of suburbanites and voters of color — and whether Democrats can redraw their congressional map in California, which would bolster Gavin Newsom’s presidential aspirations.\n\nInside Washington has been following these races ravenously, checking out fundraising, polling and early voting. While occasionally we get it wrong and we promptly admit it, here’s our boldest predictions for tomorrow night’s elections in the heart of Dixie, the Garden State, the Big Apple and the Golden State.\n\nThis is the easiest one for the ol’ crystal ball. Abigail Spanberger, a former CIA officer congresswoman who turned a red district in the suburbs of Richmond blue in 2018, will crush Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears. \n\nWhile Sears has gone all-in on transphobia, it has fallen flat amid a government shutdown and Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency slashing federal jobs, which particularly hurts employees in the northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C. Sears also fell for Spanberger’s bait in a debate when she said “that’s not discrimination” when Spanberger pointed out Earle-Sears would ban same-sex marriage. \n\nWhat matters is just how big Spanberger’s win will be. Democrats hope to gain a supermajority in the state House of Delegates, which would allow them to redraw their congressional map with ease. Polling shows a Spanberger lead between 10 to 14 points. \n\nFinal prediction: Spanberger wins by 12 percent and nabs a supermajority.\n\nIf the governor’s race in Virginia a matter of how big Spanberger will win, the attorney general’s race is going to be razor-thin. \n\nWhile governors cannot run for consecutive terms in Virginia, the attorney general can. Republican Jason Miyares flipped the seat in 2021 and would likely be a future candidate for governor. Unlike Earle-Sears, he’s earned Trump’s support. \n\nAnd he’s running against an incredibly flawed candidate in Democrat Jay Jones, who came under fire after text messages revealed that he fantasized about shooting and killing the former speaker of the state House Todd Gilbert and calling his children “little fascists.” \n\nPolling has shown the race is either in a dead heat or even has Jones in the lead. If Democrats win, he will likely join lawsuits against the Trump administration. But if Miyares wins, he might serve as a bulwark against the Spanberger administration and the general assembly. \n\nFinal prediction: Based on Spanberger having a big enough margin of victory, Jones wins by less than a point. \n\nAs New Jersey’s most famous son would say, you can’t start a midterm fire without an off-year spark. In 2024, Kamala Harris only won it by a little less than six points, about ten points less than Joe Biden won it in 2020. \n\nTrump did it by flipping Passaic County, home to a large Latino population. He cut into Democratic margins in Hudson County, whose large Cuban-American population led to part of it being called “Havana on the Hudson.” \n\nRepublican Jack Ciattarelli, who nearly beat incumbent Gov. Phil Murphy, is hoping that holds for his election against Rep. Mikie Sherrill. Sherrill is “national security Democrat,” in the mold of Spanberger and Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.). While she lacks the charisma of Spanberger, she’s aggressively attacked Ciattarelli, specifically after Ciattarelli’s campaign obtained her private Naval records. \n\nAnd according to VoteHub, which tracks early voting, Democrats make up about 51 percent of in-person early voting in the Garden State, while Republicans make up only 29 percent. \n\nFinal prediction: Sherrill wins by 7 percentage points\n\nNobody disputes that Zohran Mamdani will become New York City’s next mayor. What everyone wants to know is whether he wins by a big enough margin to have a clear mandate to govern. \n\nWhile Mamdani caught fire with his message about affordability, he also benefited from the fact incumbent Mayor Eric Adams exited the Democratic primary and disgraced former governor Andrew Cuomo had significant baggage in the primary due to the fact he resigned after allegations of sexual misconduct. \n\nFor Mamdani to have a mandate, he’ll need to not only win, but win a clear majority. That means not just running up the margins with Latinos, Asian-Americans and young upwardly mobile professional whites; it will require him cutting into Cuomo’s margins with Black voters, the beating heart of the Democratic Party establishment. So far, Mamdani has the momentum. \n\nFinal prediction: Mamdani clears a majority, but does not hit 55 percent. A safe bet is around 52 to 53 percent.\n\nNo Democratic elected official has made himself the face of the anti-Trump resistance more than California Gov. Gavin Newsom. When Texas began its efforts to add five safe Republican seats, Newsom responded by saying he’d “meet fire with fire” and shepherded a ballot initiative known as Proposition 50 to allow for a one-time partisan redraw of congressional districts to respond to Texas’s gerrymander. \n\nIt’s an audacious move. But Democrats have poured $129 million to support the initiative, with Newsom and his allies making up 72 percent of all spending, according to AdImpact. If it passes, Democrats can get around the nonpartisan redistricting commission and draw seats that will put Republicans out of a job and allow the Democrats to get a boost in the 2026 midterm. \n\nIn addition, it will undoubtedly vault Newsom to the front of the 2028 presidential field and it’s not even close. The University of California Berkley’s Institute of Governmental Studies had the initiative polling at 60 percent. Early voter turnout overwhelmingly favors the Democrats. By turning the initiative into a referendum against Trump, it looks like Democrats have the right message.\n\nFinal prediction: Proposition 50 passes with 58 percent of the vote.\n\nOf course, take these predictions with a grain of salt. In the past, I’ve predicted Kamala Harris would win the prediency, Trump would pick a woman as his running mate and said the Dobbs effect after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade would not be a thing in 2022, only to think it would be a thing in 2024.

In a sneak peek video into Season 12, the cast of employees at Lisa Vanderpump’s restaurant sets the stage for some dramatic pumping, partying, and picking sides. “I used to say SUR is where you take your mistress,” Vanderpump says in the clip. “But now, it’s probably where you meet her.”\n\nReturning on Dec. 2, Vanderpump Rules brings new cast members into the family and embraces their messiness along the way. “This is SUR, we’re a family,” Vanderpump says. “They’re not perfect, but they’re mine.”\n\nOn and off the clock, keeping business separate from pleasure is getting difficult, as newcomer Angelica Jensen admits in the teaser. She already has her sights set on Shayne Davis, whose Hinge profile she looked over more meticulously than a resume. Other employees, like Venus Binkley, are juggling their ability “to work, party, have sex.”\n\n“I’ve always said with my staff,” Vanderpump says, “‘give me anything, but don’t give me boring.’”\n\nTrending Stories\n\nGrateful Dead Singer Donna Jean Godchaux Dead at 78\n\nLawsuit Against Spotify Claims ‘Billions’ of Drake Streams Were ‘Fraudulent’\n\nRussell Simmons Owed Millions to His Accusers.

It marked the first full reboot on the network since Real Housewives of New York overturned their cast during its 14th season. The news also followed the aftermath of a cheating scandal that revealed a months-long affair between Tom Sandoval and Rachel Leviss behind Ariana Madix’s back. Rather than make futile repairs, it seemed best to start from scratch.\n\n“What made Vanderpump Rules fun was the sheer level of chaos on display. The cast went from enemies to besties, to lovers and exes all in one episode, week after week,” Rolling Stone wrote about the series last year. “Against a backdrop of reality TV that was focused on wealth and opulence, the lives of the SUR staff initially provided an element of escapism and even a level of relatability to the audience … This began to change as the stars grew up and forged lucrative careers as influencers and business people beyond Vanderpump’s restaurants.”\n\nDiane Ladd, Oscar-Nominated Actress in 'Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore,' 'Wild at Heart,' Dead at 89\n\nJon Blistein\n\nJon Stewart Will Keep Hosting ‘The Daily Show’ in 2026\n\nMoment of Zen\n\nJon Blistein\n\nStephen Colbert Says It’s ‘Reasonable’ for People to Think CBS Canceled Him to Appease Trump\n\nCanned Heat\n\nJon Blistein\n\n‘I Was Nervous About Leaving the Heisenberg Universe’: Vince Gilligan on ‘Pluribus’\n\nAlan Sepinwall\n\nGeorge Clooney Says It Was a ‘Mistake’ for Kamala Harris to Replace Joe Biden in Election\n\nHindsight Is...\n\nEmily Zemler\n\nGo to PMC.com\n\nMost Popular\n\n'When Women Thrive, the Community Thrives': Inside Variety's Power of Women Event Featuring Jamie Lee Curtis, Sydney Sweeney, Kate Hudson, Nicole Scherzinger and Wanda Sykes\n\n'Dancing With the Stars’ Crowns Dance Marathon Winner as One Contestant Suffers an Injury on Halloween Night: See the Scores, Who Went Home\n\nMLB Should Abolish the Intentional Walk After Shohei Ohtani Debacle\n\nWe Unofficially Know Who Mel Owens Picks in The Golden Bachelor Finale\n\nYou might also like\n\nReese Witherspoon Did Not Return to ‘SNL’ for Nearly 15 Years After Hosting the First Episode After 9/11: It ‘Was Too Much Responsibility for a 24-Year-Old Girl’\n\n5 hours ago\n\n36 Celebrity Couples Who Have Significant Age Differences\n\nJanine Pescetto Joins BCI as President of Sales\n\n4 hours ago\n\nDoes ‘Bugonia’ Have the Legs to Be Yorgos Lanthimos’ Biggest Box Office Hit Yet?\n\n4 hours ago\n\nLouisville QB Miller Moss Becomes New Rep of House v.

It Didn’t Work Before","text":"The Democratic Party appears stuck in 2012, as it rolls out former President Barack Obama to campaign for its candidates in close races.\n\nObama is clearly seen as their campaign closer, as he’s being used to stump for candidates and issues across the country leading up to the Nov. 4 election. Obama has been in Virginia campaigning for Democratic candidate Abigail Spanberger’s gubernatorial contest and in New Jersey for Democratic candidate Mikie Sherrill’s governor’s race. Democrats also put Obama in a 30-second ad to promote California’s new redistricting ballot measure (Prop. 50), and Obama personally endorsed and praised Democratic Socialist New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, calling him to offer support ahead of the election.\n\n Obama: I worry about the growing concentration of economic power in this country where just a handful of mega-billionaires and companies controlling what we see and what we hear. I worry about how much that economic power distorts the political process. I worry about how readily… pic.twitter.com/HbeOFzEKUs — Acyn (@Acyn) November 1, 2025\n\nAnd while Obama still enjoys high praise and popularity from the Democratic base, his support doesn’t sway Republican or Independent voters, one Democratic strategist, who remained anonymous, told The Hill.\n\n“The more we move away from the Obama presidency, the less muscle he has to push. It’s just the reality. We saw that with President Clinton, and we’re seeing it now with Obama,” the strategist said, adding that this became abundantly clear when Obama’s campaign work did little to move the needle for former Vice President Kamala Harris during her race against now-President Donald Trump. (Sign up for Mary Rooke’s weekly newsletter here!)\n\n“And that’s with all the buzz around his speech at the convention, and all the rallies in the final days,” the strategist told The Hill. “In the end, no one cares about the surrogates. They care about the candidates themselves.”\n\n In case you’re wondering: THIS is why they called in Barack Obama THIS is why out-of-state Democrat donors are frantically dumping millions into Virginia The national Democrat establishment took Virginia for granted.

They don’t seem to understand that what makes him popular among Democrats makes him equally as unpopular with everyone else. (ROOKE: Democrats Trying To Use Trump’s Signature Bill To Fund Their Attacks)\n\nDemocrats are likely looking at the bigger picture during this off-season election cycle, when voter turnout is typically low. Obama doesn’t need to appeal to Republican and Independent voters for the Democratic candidate to be successful. He just needs to energize the base enough for them to show up on Election Day.\n\nThey clearly feel confident in his ability to do that.\n\nFollow Mary Rooke on X: @MaryRooke\n\nSign up for Mary Rooke’s weekly newsletter here!","summary":"What do you think?","url":"https://dailycaller.com/2025/11/03/democrats-barack-obama-campaign-stump-virginia-new-jersey-new-york-city-sherrill-spanberger-mamdani/","image":"https://images.dailycaller.com/image/width=1280,height=549,fit=cover,format=webp,f=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn01.dailycaller.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2025%2F11%2FGettyImages-2244535209-scaled-e1762199513677.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-03 20:06:53","author":"Mary Rooke","authors":["Mary Rooke"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.026},{"id":375438456,"title":"Puking and urinating in public is no way to go through life, your Honor [Dumbass]","text":"Skip to content\n\nDo you have adblock enabled?\n\nTry Ads-Free Fark\n\nIt's Not News, It's Fark\n\nHow To FarkLog In | Sign Up »\n\nForgot password?\n\n Turn on javascript (or enable it for Fark) for a better user experience.\n\nIf you can read this, either the style sheet didn't load or you have an older browser that doesn't support\nstyle sheets.

If this were Pennsylvania, this would not have worked; voters in the Keystone State want candidates to tell them what they are for.\n\nHowever, Democratic gubernatorial nominee Abigail Spanberger has also done a consistent job of talking about the economy by tying state Republicans in Richmond to Trump, adding a nuance on economic uncertainty that is appealing to voters.\n\nThis has worked in the blue state in the same way it did in 2024 for Republicans and Trump in the swing states, where they were very effective in taking down former Vice President Kamala Harris on the economy.\n\nVoters who will drive the results of this election in suburban Washington, D.C., and Richmond, primarily white and wealthy, will vote solidly for Spanberger, who formerly represented Virginia’s 7th Congressional District. Those not voting for Spanberger from those enclaves are middle-class Hispanics who favor Republican candidates.\n\nMake no mistake, Spanberger is heading to a comfortable win — and she will take down several Republicans in down-ballot legislative races. The race to watch remains between Jay Jones, the Democratic nominee for attorney general who sent violent text messages in 2022 to a colleague fantasizing about shooting then-Virginia House Speaker Todd Gilbert and his children, and sitting Attorney General Jason Miyares, a Virginia Beach Republican.\n\nMiyares is a solid candidate for the Republicans. The son of an immigrant, he is the first Hispanic candidate for either party to win statewide. He first took office in 2021 when he took out a sitting Democratic incumbent.\n\nIf Miyares narrowly wins, he will be the front-runner for the governor’s office for Republicans in 2029. However, if he loses, it will be a sign that Democratic voters and even independent voters in Virginia saw Obama give Jones a nod this past weekend by appearing with him in Norfolk.\n\nObama telegraphed to voters that he is in a let-the-consequences-be-damned, win-at-all-costs moment because he has realized that his legacy is that of a man who won the presidency twice but with numerous asterisks, including losing substantially in the 2009 Virginia and New Jersey governors races, the House in 2010, the Senate in 2014, and legislative majorities across the country.\n\nHis presidency was also followed by Trump winning in the next cycle and his former vice president, Joe Biden, costing his party the White House, the majority in the Senate, and the House in 2024.\n\nIt seems there is no person from rural Virginia to the cities who doesn’t know about Jones’s violent texts or his getting away with no consequences for violating the law by dangerously speeding. These are things only someone with elite connections could get away with.\n\nEveryone saw Jones take the stage ahead of Obama in Norfolk over the weekend.\n\nWHY NORTHERN VIRGINIA SCHOOLS ARE STILL WOKE BATTLEGROUNDS\n\nObama is looking to be a hero. It doesn’t matter that he telegraphed to voters how morally corrupt a candidate is to him; what matters to Obama is getting Jones over the finish line because Miyares is more of a threat politically to the Democratic Party than Jones, who fantasized about murdering a man and his children just because there was an “R” after his name.\n\nWhile neither Obama nor Spanberger mentioned Jones in Norfolk, the message of Jones being on the same stage at the same rally was undeniable: win at all costs.","summary":"WINCHESTER, Virginia —&#160;The expectation is that sitting Lt.

It is described as a “stunning journey through Michelle Obama’s style evolution, in her own words for the first time.”\n\nThe description reads in part:\n\nObama’s intimate and candid stories illuminate how her approach to dressing has evolved throughout her life—from the colorful sheath dresses, cardigans, and brooches she wore during her time as First Lady to the bold suits, denim, and braids of her post-White House life and all the active looks and beautiful gowns in between.\nIn The Look, Michelle Obama explores the joy and the purpose of fashion and beauty and how—when wielded with grace and care—they can uplift and affirm the values one holds most dear. Confidence, she concludes, cannot be put on. But when you’re wearing something that’s intentional or beloved, clothing can make you feel like the best version of yourself.\n\nIn the book, Obama – who has appeared on the cover of Vogue three times – complained that she was under more scrutiny than others due to her status as a black woman.\n\n“We were all too aware that as a first black couple, we couldn’t afford any missteps. And that as a black woman, I was under a particularly white hot glare,” she wrote, asserting that she and her husband “didn’t get the grace that I think some other families have gotten.”\n\nShe also explained that appearance through style and fashion is “an important way that we send a message” and speaks to an individual’s culture.\n\n“We live in a culture, sadly, where, you know, if somebody wants to go after a woman, the first thing they do is go after our looks, our size, our physical being, as a way to, you know, make us feel small, to keep us in place,” she said, according to the New York Post.\n\nApparently lost on the former first lady is the fact that first lady Melania Trump – a former model entrenched in the fashion world – has been snubbed by the establishment media and leftist magazines, despite her status as a high fashion figure throughout her life.\n\nThis is hardly the first time Michelle Obama has pointed to race after departing the White House. In 2019, for example, Obama was quick to criticize the United States abroad, stating that the country is “still not where we need to be” on the issue of racism.\n\n“We’re still not where we need to be in the United States of America when it comes to race,” she said at the Obama Foundation’s leadership conference in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.\n\n“People thought electing Barack Obama would end racism. That’s 400 years of stuff that was going to be eliminated because of eight years of this kid from Hawaii? Are you kidding me?” she asked.\n\nRight before the historic 2024 presidential election, Michelle Obama continued in her narrative, heavily implying that people who did not support former Vice President Kamala Harris for president were sexist and racist.\n\n“Kamala Harris is an extraordinary human being, she is an extraordinary candidate, and she will be an extraordinary president of the United States of America. Mark my words. So, Michigan, with all that being said, I gotta ask myself, well why on earth is this race even close?” Obama asked at the time.\n\n“I lay awake at night wondering, what in the world is going on? And, it’s clear to me, the question for me isn’t whether Kamala is ready for this moment — because by every measure she has demonstrated that she’s ready. The real question is, as a country, are we ready for this moment?” she asked.","summary":"Michelle Obama is still asserting that she was treated differently in her official capacity as first lady of the United States, claiming that she survived under a \"particularly white hot glare\" as she served as the first black FLOTUS.\n\n\nThe post Michelle Obama Claims She Was Under a &#8216;Particularly White Hot Glare&#8217; as First Black FLOTUS appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/11/03/michelle-obama-claims-she-was-under-a-particularly-white-hot-glare-as-first-black-flotus/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/11/GettyImages2204942925-640x335.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-03 19:33:07","author":"Hannah Knudsen","authors":["Hannah Knudsen"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.299},{"id":375408400,"title":"Zohran’s NYC race recasts U.S. politics","text":"It was Zohran Mamdani’s campaign ad in Hindi with him explaining rank-choice voting in the Democratic primary for the New York City mayoral race that caught my attention earlier in the year.\n\nNot to mention, he explained the electoral system using 3 cups of mango lassi!\n\nWhile his electrifying media campaign has catapulted him, it was the background work that the campaign did that truly made me sit up – he started with talking to Trump voters instead of seeking approval of wealthy donors. The campaign is rewriting the playbook for how political entrepreneurs run for office in real-time.\n\nThe New York City mayoral race has provided a surprising but a much-needed inflection point in American politics. It seems to be architecting a generationally distinct political identity that could enrich political competition rooted in ideas for the future, a genuine desire to solve problems, and a commitment to build a stronger union that is much needed.\n\nMr. Mamdani’s victory in the primary and his most likely win in the general election will stand on the support of working class people – both young and middle-aged. His platform of affordability while holding on to his socio-political convictions directly challenges the politically baffling stance of his own party’s leadership. While American progressives (not “centrist” Democrats) have closed ranks behind Mr. Mamdani, surprisingly, on the affordability question, he has also captured some attention from significant representatives of the American right – Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Tucker Carlson, early MAGA (Make America Great Again) luminaries.\n\nHis messages of affordability seem to bring together the working class right and the left. The working class’s drift away from the established left started with the 2016 Presidential election (from being evenly split in 2012 to giving Mr. Trump a decisive edge). The gap narrowed somewhat in 2020 because of Joe Biden’s pro-labour image but widened again in 2024 against Kamala Harris. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer once said that for every working class voter the Democratic Party loses, it gains two suburban, moderate Republicans; encapsulating this self-defeating drift\n\nFocusing on the economic throughline, data from the Census and the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that since 2000, the American median income has grown only by 7%, while the consumer price index has jumped 60% – reflecting an entire generation of economic immobility. About 40% of children in the U.S. are born on Medicaid, the insurance programme for low-income families, meaning almost half of all the newborns start life in functional poverty. This has been the trend for at least a decade under both Democratic and Republican administrations.\n\nEconomic anxiety\n\nThe middle class is not faring any better. Massive college debt with no real employment prospects is crushing new and recent graduates. The aspirations of owning a home, starting families and someday retiring are fast fading into folklore. The resulting social dysfunction is manifesting in troubling ways among the youth - women are more educated and lean progressive whereas young men have increasingly lower college enrolment dampening their economic prospects and making them more vulnerable to extreme views and isolation.\n\nMr. Mamdani seems to have bucked this trend during the campaign. So, there may be some hope here to bring back young men into the political fold. But overall, there is an undercurrent coming to surface across political persuasions, religious and racial identities, and everything else that political systems use to divide people. And that undercurrent is of economic anxiety. The broader economic structure is increasingly seen as oligarchic by most working class people and is giving room for someone like Mr. Mamdani, who identifies himself as a Democratic Socialist. Senator Bernie Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have had a strong showing of their oligarchy tour even in Republican States.\n\nVoter discontent\n\nA recent Washington Post-ABC poll shows 7 out of 10 Americans say Democrats are “out-of-touch”, but also shows 6 out of 10 Americans feel the same way about Republicans and President Donald Trump; expect political insurgents on both sides. Tying this back to the New York City race, while rent control and free buses may be local issues, the broader affordability theme it underscores is inescapable. We could see an interesting convergence among Republicans and Democrats when it comes to the issue of affordability.\n\nThe administration’s attempts to resurrect the decimated working class has manifested in unstable tariff prescriptions making middle-class small businesses (accounting for 40% of GDP) and their employees (constituting 46% of the labour force) especially vulnerable. The Presidential election may have indeed been run on immigration and “woke” issues, but cultural polarisation is now getting superseded by the financial fragility of American families. With the U.S. Congress deadlocked on government funding, these economic anxieties are only rising.\n\nOne thing, however, is getting clear—the one word that pundits and the broader political ecosystem avoids like the plague is increasingly the lens through which to see things—class. The margin of Mr. Mamdani’s victory on Tuesday will mark an important milestone in this imminent re-architecting of American political thinking.\n\nRohit Tripathi is Principal at VU Capital (Strategy Consulting)","summary":"The New York City mayoral race seems to be architecting a generationally distinct political identity that could enrich political competition rooted in ideas for the future","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/zohrans-nyc-race-recasts-us-politics/article70235778.ece","image":"https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/6zzr1m/article70237737.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/2025-10-27T022019Z_104799125_RC21KHAVOU3U_RTRMADP_3_USA-ELECTION-NEW-YORK-MAYOR.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-03 19:20:00","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.184},{"id":375400772,"title":"Stephen Colbert says it’s ‘self-evident’ that Trump settlement is ‘damaging to the reputation’ of CBS","text":"Stephen Colbert took a direct shot at CBS and its parent company during a recent interview, claiming that Paramount's payment of $16 million to President Donald Trump to settle a “meritless” lawsuit against the network has damaged its reputation and news division.\n\nThe late-night star – who is leaving the network after his show airs its final episode next May – said he couldn’t see why anyone would settle a frivolous complaint “other than to curry favor” with the president.\n\nDuring a wide-ranging conversation with GQ, published Monday, Colbert was asked about his top-rated show’s cancellation, announced just days after he publicly suggested that Paramount had paid a “big fat bribe” to Trump to approve its $8.4 billion merger with Skydance Media. \n\nAt the time, Paramount insisted that it was “purely a financial decision” to pull the plug on The Late Show, claiming late-night television had become unprofitable and that it had nothing to do with either the upcoming merger or Colbert’s fervently anti-Trump stance. Days after the cancellation was announced, which was cheered by Trump and his handpicked FCC chairman Brendan Carr, the administration approved Skydance’s purchase of Paramount.\n\nColbert told GQ how CBS explained that “they’re getting out of the late-night space altogether because it’s no longer profitable for the network.” But he said that he still “found it very surprising” and felt that if his show couldn’t turn a profit, no late-night program could. \n\nAs for whether he found the corporate explanation plausible, Colbert snarked that David Ellison – the new chairman of Paramount and son of billionaire Trump ally Larry Ellison – might have the solution for what ails network television these days.\n\n“Television’s in huge trouble. Maybe David Ellison [CEO of Paramount Skydance] will fix everything. No, no. Seriously. Maybe he will. Maybe he’ll fix everything,” he quipped. “But it’s clear that television is in a lot of transitions. It’s been going on for a long time. But that’s not my end of the business. My end of the business is the jokes.”\n\nAfter it was pointed out that his show was canceled just two days after he described the settlement as a potential bribe - and that a number of Democratic lawmakers have said the cancellation was “politically motivated” - Colbert said he “can understand why people would have that reaction” due to the payoff to Trump.\n\nColbert concluded the only logical reason was to get on the president’s good side, noting that Paramount “decided to cut a check for $16 million” to Trump over a lawsuit that the network’s own lawyers “said is completely without merit.”\n\n“And it is self-evident that that is damaging to the reputation of the network, the corporation, and the news division,” he added. “So it is unclear to me why anyone would do that other than to curry favor with a single individual. If people have theories that associate me with that, it’s a reasonable thing to think, because CBS or the corporation clearly did it once.”\n\nOn Sunday President Trump sat down with CBS News’ “60 Minutes”, one year after filing a lawsuit against the news program over its editing of a Kamala Harris interview, which he claimed caused him “mental anguish” due to “election interference.”\n\nDuring the nearly 90-minute sit-down with correspondent Norah O’Donnell, the president boasted that the network “paid me a lotta money” to settle the lawsuit while also complimenting Ellison, and new CBS News editor-in-chief Bari Weiss.\n\n“I see good things happening in the news. I really do,” Trump told O’Donnell. “And I think one of the best things to happen is this show and new ownership, CBS and new ownership. I think it’s the greatest thing that’s happened in a long time to a free and open and good press.”\n\nThose portions of the conversation, however, were edited out of Sunday’s TV broadcast and were only made available in the unedited transcript and extended video clip published online. \n\nA CBS News insider told The Independent that not including Trump’s comments about the settlement and network leadership during the telecast was “f***ing reckless,” since it was obvious that many viewers would want to see him address the lawsuit, at the very least.\n\n“Why would you subject yourself to this type of criticism? Just put it in, because it’s the first thing that I was looking for,” the insider added.\n\nColbert’s latest jabs at Paramount and Ellison come a couple of weeks after he jokingly professed his “love” for the media mogul during his opening Late Show monologue.\n\n“I want to take a moment to celebrate my new boss, Paramount CEO David Ellison. Mr. Ellison, I love you,” Colbert gleefully declared. “That oughta buy us a couple more months.”","summary":"‘Television’s in huge trouble.

In addition, several important political contests are on Tuesday ballots, including the New York City mayor's election, gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey, and California's Prop. 50 to decide whether officials can redraw the state's congressional map to favor Democrats. Disney on Monday sought a temporary thaw in tensions with Google Inc. after the two sides failed last week to strike a new distribution contract covering Disney's television channels on Google's YouTube TV. “Despite the impasse that led to the current blackout, we have asked YouTube TV to restore ABC for Election Day so subscribers have access to the information they rely on,\" a Disney spokesperson said in a statement Monday. \"We believe in putting the public interest first and hope YouTube TV will take this small step for their customers while we continue to work toward a fair agreement.” A Google spokesperson was not immediately available for a comment. ABC's \"World News Tonight With David Muir\" is one of television's highest rated programs. More than 10 million YouTube TV customers lost access to ESPN, ABC and other Disney channels late Thursday after a collapse in negotiations over distribution fees for Disney channels, causing one of the largest recent blackouts in the television industry. The two TV giants wrangled for weeks over how much Google must pay to carry Disney’s channels, including FX, Disney Jr. and National Geographic. YouTube TV — now one of the largest pay-TV services in the U.S. — has balked at Disney’s price demands, leading to the outage. YouTube TV does not have the legal right to distribute Disney's networks after its last distribution agreement expired. “We know this is a frustrating and disappointing outcome for our subscribers,” a YouTube spokesperson said in a statement last week. “We continue to urge Disney to work with us constructively to reach a fair agreement that restores their networks to YouTube TV.” YouTube has said that should the outage stretch for “an extended period,” it would offer its subscribers a $20 credit. Spanish-language TelevisaUnivision-owned channels were knocked off YouTube TV in a separate dispute that has lasted more than a month. Televisa has appealed to high-level political officials, including President Trump and Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr. Last year, after Disney-owned channels went dark on DirecTV in a separate carriage fee dispute, Disney offered to make available to DirecTV subscribers its ABC coverage of the sole presidential debate between President Trump and then-Vice President Kamala Harris. DirecTV viewed ABC's offer as something of a stunt, noting the debate would be streamed. DirecTV countered by asking Disney to instead make all of its channels available. That fee dispute resulted in a 13-day blackout on DirecTV. Heightened tensions in the television industry have led to numerous blackouts. In 2023, Disney and Charter Communications were unable to iron out a new contract by their deadline, resulting in a 10-day blackout of Disney channels on Charter's Spectrum service. A decade earlier, Time Warner Cable subscribers went nearly a month without CBS-owned channels. Programming companies, including Disney, have asked for higher fees for their channels to help offset the increased cost of sports programming, including NFL and NBA contracts. But pay-TV providers, including YouTube have pushed back, attempting to draw a line to slow their customers' ever-increasing monthly bills. More than 40 million pay-TV customer homes have cut the cord over the last decade, according to industry data. Many have switched to smaller streaming packages.

We counted at least 18 inaccurate assertions.\n\nTrump told his usual lie that the free and fair 2020 election was stolen from him. He lied again that grocery prices “are down” even after CBS’ Norah O’Donnell informed him they are up. He declared once more that there is now “no inflation,” though there certainly is, and then that inflation is 2% or “even less than 2%,” though the most recent available Consumer Price Index figure is now up to 3%.\n\nRELATED: Trump cabinet official: SNAP cutoff has ‘silver lining’\n\nThe president also deployed multiple other fictional numbers during his exchanges with O’Donnell, which were recorded Friday and released by CBS on Sunday.\n\nHe falsely claimed “$17 trillion” is being invested in the US “right now,” though the $17 trillion figure is nearly double the White House’s own wildly inflated figure.\nHe falsely claimed each alleged drug boat the US has attacked in recent weeks “kills 25,000 Americans,” though experts note this figure plainly does not make sense.\nHe falsely claimed some recent former presidents invoked the Insurrection Act “28 times,” though no individual president has invoked it on more than six occasions with this record set by President Ulysses S. Grant in the 1800s.\nHe falsely claimed he has ended “eight wars,” though his list includes two situations that were not wars at all and at least one war that continues.\nHe falsely claimed CBS aired an edited interview with Trump’s 2024 opponent Kamala Harris “two days” before the election, though it was actually more than four full weeks before Election Day.\nHe falsely claimed former President Joe Biden gave $350 billion in aid to Ukraine (the real number is well under half that) and allowed in “25 million” migrants (the real number here is well under half that, too).\n\nAnd Trump made a variety of additional false claims on several subjects, including the government shutdown, the artificial intelligence boom, tariffs, his first impeachment and his former legal battle with “60 Minutes” itself.\n\nCBS posted a full transcript of the interview, which O’Donnell said ran for nearly 90 minutes, and a nearly 73-minute video; it aired about 28 minutes on television.\n\nHere is a more detailed breakdown of Trump’s claims.\n\nThe economy\n\nGrocery prices\n\nWhen O’Donnell noted that Americans have “seen their grocery prices go up,” Trump repeated his regular false claim that grocery prices are actually declining: “No, you’re wrong. They went up under Biden. Right now they’re going down. Other than beef, which we’re working on, which we can solve very quickly.” Trump repeated later in the interview, “Our groceries are down.”\n\nGrocery prices are up under Trump — and while there has been a particularly large increase in the price of beef, there have also been increases in the price of numerous other products. Consumer Price Index figures for September showed average grocery prices had increased since August (about 0.3%), since September 2024 (about 2.7%), and since January 2025 (about 1.4%), the month Trump returned to office. Prices in all six major grocery product categories tracked by the Consumer Price Index, such as “fruits and vegetables” and “cereals and bakery products,” are up over the past year.\n\nInflation under Trump\n\nTrump falsely claimed, “We have no inflation” and “we don’t have any inflation.” (He said at another point of the interview that “essentially we don’t have inflation.”) He also falsely claimed, “We’re down to 2%, even less than 2%.” There is inflation; it has been worsening since May after hitting a four-year low in April; and it’s not 2% or less than 2%. The year-over-year rate was about 3% in September, up from about 2.9% in August; the September figure was nearly identical to the roughly 3% rate in January, the last partial month of the Biden administration and first partial month of the second Trump administration.\n\nInflation under Biden\n\nTrump falsely claimed that President Joe “Biden gave me the worst inflation rate in the history of our country” and that “I inherited the worst inflation in the history of our country.” Trump could have fairly said the US inflation rate hit a 40-year high under Biden in June 2022, when it was 9.1%, but that was not close to the all-time record of 23.7%, set in 1920 — and, again, the rate then declined to about 3% in January 2025, the month Trump took over from Biden. Trump’s claim was also wrong if he was claiming there was record cumulative inflation over the course of Biden’s presidency. It was about 21%, compared with about 49% during President Jimmy Carter’s term.\n\nInvestment in the US\n\nTrump repeated his frequent false claim that “we have $17 trillion being invested in the United States right now,” then said moments later that it is “more than $17 trillion right now.” This “$17 trillion” figure is fictional even without the “more than.” As of the time the “60 Minutes” interview aired on Sunday, the White House’s own website said the “major investment announcements” this term totaled “$8.9 trillion” — and a detailed CNN review in October found the White House was counting trillions of dollars in vague investment pledges from foreign countries and companies, pledges that were about “bilateral trade” or “economic exchange” rather than investment in the US, or vague statements that didn’t even rise to the level of pledges. You can read more here.\n\nWho pays tariffs\n\nTrump claimed, as he often does, that China and other foreign countries pay the tariffs he has imposed on their exports. In reality, US importers, not China or other foreign countries, make the tariff payments to the US government, and they often pass on at least some of the costs to consumers; study after study, including one from the federal government’s bipartisan US International Trade Commission, found that people and entities in the US bore almost the entire cost of Trump’s first-term tariffs on Chinese products.\n\nAI and power\n\nTrump correctly noted that some artificial intelligence companies are moving to generate their own power on the same sites as their energy-hungry data centers — but falsely added that letting companies make their own electricity “was my idea, which nobody, frankly, had thought of.” There is simply no basis for Trump’s claim that he came up with this idea. News articles last year, when Trump was an out-of-office candidate for president, discussed how AI companies were already experimenting with on-site power generation and how the Biden administration was on board with the idea; one article from April 2024, for example, discussed how the Energy Department was “exploring how energy-hungry tech firms might be able to host small nuclear plants on the campuses of their massive data centers.”\n\nForeign policy\n\nStrikes on alleged drug boats\n\nAfter Trump was asked about the recent US military strikes on alleged drug trafficking boats in the Caribbean, he said, “Every one of those boats kills 25,000 Americans. Every single boat that you see that’s shot down kills 25,000 on drugs, and destroys families all over our country.”\n\nAside from the fact that the Trump administration has not presented public proof for his repeated claims that the boats carried fentanyl, the drug involved in the highest number of US overdose deaths — the Caribbean is not known to be a significant fentanyl-smuggling route — his “25,000” number does not make sense. The total number of US overdose deaths from all drugs in 2024 was about 82,000, according to provisional federal data. Trump is essentially claiming, in other words, that attacking 16 boats prevented more than four years’ worth of American overdose deaths.\n\nThe president’s figure is “absurd,” Carl Latkin, a professor at the Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health with a joint appointment at its medical school, said in October. “He’s claiming that he’s solved the overdose mortality crisis” with four boat strikes, and “that does not have any semblance of reality.” You can read a longer fact check here.\n\nTrump and wars\n\nTrump repeated his false claim that he “knocked out eight wars,” adding, “I took eight wars and stopped (them) during an eight-month period” this presidency. Reading from a paper, he listed “Cambodia-Thailand,” “Kosovo-Serbia,” “the Congo and Rwanda,” “Pakistan and India,” “Israel and Iran,” “Egypt and Ethiopia,” “Armenia and Azerbaijan,” and “Israel and Hamas.”\n\nTrump’s “eight” figure is a clear exaggeration.\n\nThere was no war between Egypt and Ethiopia for Trump to end; the two countries were in a long-running diplomatic dispute about a major Ethiopian dam project on a tributary of the Nile River, but that is not a war, and the dispute is unresolved. Trump’s list includes another supposed war that didn’t occur during his presidency, between Kosovo and Serbia. (He has sometimes claimed to have prevented the eruption of a new war between those two entities, providing few details about what he meant, but that is different from settling an actual war.) And the war involving the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda has continued despite a peace agreement brokered by the Trump administration this year — which was never signed by the leading rebel coalition doing the fighting.\n\nOne can debate the importance of Trump’s role in having ended the other conflicts on his list, or fairly question whether some of them have truly ended. For example, killing has continued in Gaza after the October ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas. Regardless, Trump’s “eight” figure is too big.\n\nBiden and aid to Ukraine\n\nTrump repeated his false claim that “Joe Biden gave $350 billion to Ukraine, including a lot of weapons, a tremendous amount of weapons.” The “$350 billion” figure isn’t close to accurate.\n\nThe US government inspector general overseeing the federal Ukraine response says the US had disbursed about $94 billion as of the end of June 2025 (and had appropriated about $93 billion more), including money that was spent in the US and in broader Europe rather than Ukraine itself. And a German think tank that has closely tracked wartime aid to Ukraine says the US allocated about $135 billion to Ukraine (and had committed about $5 billion more) through August, at current exchange rates.\n\nImmigration\n\nThe shutdown, Democrats and immigrants\n\nTalking about the ongoing government shutdown, Trump said of Democrats, “I can’t give them $1.5 trillion so that they can give welfare to people that came into our country illegally.” But that is not what Democrats are seeking.\n\nDemocrats are primarily proposing to reverse Trump-approved cuts to Medicaid and other health programs and to extend the enhanced pandemic-era Obamacare subsidies that are scheduled to expire at the end of the year. Undocumented people are not eligible for either Obamacare subsidies or federal Medicaid insurance coverage (though hospitals are required to provide people with emergency care regardless of immigration status or ability to pay).\n\nTrump’s White House itself has claimed that Democrats are proposing to spend about $193 billion (not $1.5 trillion) on health care for “illegal immigrants and other non-citizens” and the White House published an itemized list that makes clear that even by its own contested calculations, the majority of even that smaller sum would be for these “other non-citizens” who are in the US legally.\n\nThe Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a fiscal watchdog group, has estimated that the spending proposal the Democrats released in September would add $1.5 trillion to the debt over the next decade. But that figure is not about spending on undocumented people in particular.\n\nForeign leaders, prisons and migration\n\nTrump repeated his regular claim that foreign countries are deliberately emptying their prisons to somehow send inmates to the US as migrants, at one point identifying Venezuela as a supposed culprit and at another point speaking more broadly — saying “very smart” foreign leaders “want people that are bad out” and so “what do they do? They open their jails, they let ‘em out. They get rid of their drug dealers, they let ‘em out. But you know who else they get out? The people that are on welfare that aren’t working. In other words, they have people that just don’t work. They don’t want people that just don’t work, so they put them into our country.”\n\nTrump has never substantiated such claims, though he has been making them since his 2024 campaign. Experts on international prison policy and crime in Venezuela have told CNN they have seen no evidence of Venezuela or any other country emptying jails for migration purposes, let alone that these countries actively inserted former prisoners into the US.\n\nMigration under Biden\n\nTrump repeated his false claim that 25 million migrants were allowed into the country under Biden, though he was more tentative this time than usual, saying, “Probably, I say, 25 million people were let into our country. A lot of people say it was 10 million people. But whether it was 10 or — I believe I’m much closer to the right number. Of the 25, many of them should not be here.”\n\nThe “25 million” figure is wildly inaccurate; even Trump’s previous “21 million” figure was a major exaggeration. Through December 2024, the last full month under the Biden administration, the federal government had recorded under 11 million nationwide “encounters” with migrants during that administration, including millions who were rapidly expelled from the country. Even adding in the so-called gotaways who evaded detection, estimated by House Republicans as being roughly 2.2 million, there’s no way the total was even close to Trump’s claim.\n\nLegal issues, impeachment and the 2020 election\n\nPrevious presidents and the Insurrection Act\n\nTrump spoke of the Insurrection Act, which gives the president sweeping powers to deploy troops to US states if certain vague conditions are met, and said, “Do you know that some of the presidents, recent ones, have used it 28 times? 28 times.” No president has invoked the act on more occasions than President Ulysses S. Grant’s six (after the Civil War in the 1800s), and no president has invoked it since President George H.W. Bush in 1992, according to research published in 2022 by New York University’s Brennan Center for Justice. In fact, the Insurrection Act and the similar laws that preceded it have been invoked on a total of 30 occasions in US history, the Brennan Center found.\n\nTrump also said, “Do you know how many presidents have used the Insurrection Act? Almost 50% of ‘em.” That’s at least a slight exaggeration. Seventeen of the 45 presidents to date, so just under 38%, have invoked the act or its precursor laws, according to the Brennan Center. You can read more here.\n\nTrump’s legal dispute with “60 Minutes”\n\nTrump discussed his now-resolved legal dispute with “60 Minutes” over an edit the show made to an October 2024 interview with his election opponent, then-Vice President Harris — and, as CNN chief media analyst Brian Stelter noted Sunday, Trump falsely claimed this supposedly “election-changing” interview occurred “two nights before the election.” The interview actually happened on October 7, 2024, four weeks and a day before Election Day on November 5, 2024.\n\nThis wasn’t the first time Trump made the Harris interview sound closer to Election Day than it was. He falsely claimed in June that it occurred “the day before the election.”\n\nTrump and the Justice Department\n\nCBS’ O’Donnell noted the recent indictments of three targets of Trump criticism — former FBI Director James Comey, former Trump national security adviser John Bolton, and New York Attorney General Letitia James — and asked him whether he instructed the Justice Department to “go after them”; Trump responded, “No, and not in any way, shape or form. No.” But this is obviously false: he recently put public pressure on the Justice Department to go after Comey and James.\n\nTrump wrote in a September social media post directed to “Pam” — Attorney General Pam Bondi, the head of the Justice Department — that Comey, James and Schiff are “all guilty as hell, but nothing is going to be done,” that “we can’t delay any longer” and that “JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!” (Trump intended the post to be a private message to Bondi, a source familiar with the matter told CNN after The Wall Street Journal first reported it.) Trump did not mention Bolton in that social media post; however, it’s worth noting he previously made public calls for his former adviser to be imprisoned over Bolton’s alleged inclusion of classified information in a memoir.\n\nA false story about Democrats and Trump’s first impeachment\n\nTrump delivered another version of a false story he has told since 2019 about Democrats’ response to a phone call that year in which he pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to announce an investigation into Biden, who was his looming opponent in the 2020 election. This time, Trump said, “The Democrats knew that I wasn’t guilty, because they didn’t know the — the call was — I didn’t know either: The call was essentially taped. So we knew exactly what the call — when they found out that the call was taped, Nancy Pelosi went crazy. She said, ‘You made me go into this mess.’ She screamed at all these people that made her do it, bad people like (Democratic Rep. Adam) Schiff, etc., etc.”\n\nTrump’s narrative is thoroughly inaccurate.\n\nPelosi could not possibly have been angry with Schiff or other allies after finding out the call was “taped” because, more than six years later, there is still no known US tape of the conversation; presidential calls with foreign leaders are not typically recorded by the American side. In reality, the day after Pelosi announced an impeachment inquiry in September 2019, Trump’s White House released a rough written transcript of the call. There has never been any indication that seeing the rough transcript made Pelosi feel she had been deceived into the impeachment push; the day the document was released, Pelosi issued a scathing statement accusing Trump of “lawlessness” and attempting “to shake down other countries for the benefit of his campaign.” A Pelosi spokesperson told CNN in 2024 that a Trump story similar to the one he told on “60 Minutes” was “fact-free nonsense.”\n\nTrump and the Presidential Records Act\n\nTrump decried the FBI search of his Mar-a-Lago club and residence in 2022, during the investigation into his handling of classified documents after his presidency, and he brought back his false claim that the Presidential Records Act permitted him to possess these documents: “They took things that I was allowed to have … under the Presidential Records Act, that I was allowed to have. I had records. I was allowed to have them.”\n\nThat’s not true. The Presidential Records Act clearly says that all presidential records belong to the federal government the moment the president leaves office. The key sentence from the law is unequivocal: “Upon the conclusion of a President’s term of office, or if a President serves consecutive terms upon the conclusion of the last term, the Archivist of the United States shall assume responsibility for the custody, control, and preservation of, and access to, the Presidential records of that President.”\n\nJason R. Baron, former director of litigation at the National Archives and Records Administration, told CNN when Trump made such claims during the Biden administration: “Under the Presidential Records Act, not a single document pertaining to the official business of the White House — classified or unclassified — should have been carted off to Mar-A-Lago. President Trump might consider such records to be ‘his,’ but they are not.”\n\nThat doesn’t mean Trump committed a criminal offense; the Presidential Records Act is not a criminal statute, and Trump was charged in 2023 for allegedly violating other laws. (A judge appointed by Trump dismissed the case in 2024, declaring that the appointment of the special counsel who brought the charges violated the Constitution.) But Trump was, again, wrongly describing what the act says.\n\nThe 2020 election\n\nTrump uttered his regular lie that the 2020 election “was rigged and stolen,” saying at other moments of the interview that “this was a rigged election” and that “one thing I can tell you, the 2020 election was rigged.” Trump legitimately lost a free and fair election to Biden. Trump also falsely claimed, “And it’s been caught … and you see the same information that everybody else does. And it’s coming out now in spades.” Trump didn’t explain what he was talking about, but no election-rigging or widespread fraud has “been caught.”\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

That includes California’s toleration of sex crimes and sex trafficking, lest the state “stigmatize” the LGBT community or “sex workers.”\n\nNEWSOM CONSIDERING 2028 RUN, CALLS TRUMP AN ‘INVASIVE SPECIES’\n\nLos Angeles’s underage prostitutes\n\nIn 2022, California legalized loitering with the intent to commit prostitution. This effort was led by state Sen. Scott Wiener, one of the most destructive state legislators in the country, and was signed off on by Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA), the likely future Democratic presidential nominee. This is despite prostitution still being illegal in California, at least in theory. Newsom emphasized as much after announcing that he was signing it: “To be clear, this bill does not legalize prostitution.”\n\nBut it did make it much harder to combat, especially when it comes to protecting minors. The left-wing New York Times noted as much when it did an analysis of how it changed policing in Los Angeles, specifically Figueroa Street, which it describes as “one of the most notorious sex-trafficking corridors in the United States.” As the outlet detailed, “uniformed officers could no longer apprehend groups of girls in lingerie on Figueroa, hoping to recover minors among them. Now officers needed to be willing to swear they had reason to suspect each [emphasis added] girl was underage — but with fake eyelashes and wigs, it was nearly impossible to tell.” \n\nCalifornia Democrats accept this, though, because it was done in the name of equity. Wiener described the law criminalizing loitering with the intent of prostitution as “a law that targets our community,” speaking of the LGBT community while celebrating Pride Month. Newsom echoed this, claiming the repeal was necessary because the law “disproportionately impacted Black and Brown women and members of the LGBTQ community. Black adults accounted for 56.1 %of the loitering charges in Los Angeles between 2017-2019, despite making up less than 10% of the city’s population.” The New York Times boiled down Democratic support for the law as follows: “The repeal, known as SB 357, was intended to prevent profiling of Black, brown and trans women based on how they dressed.”\n\nSo, rather than profiling people dressed provocatively on known prostitution corners and getting inequitable arrest results, California now allows prostitutes to work corners with impunity, and allows minors to be worked on those corners as a result. That is the trade-off that California Democrats are willing to make.\n\nPlease don’t stigmatize our sex crimes\n\nThe focus on “stigma” against the “LGBTQ community” is the single guiding light when it comes to how California handles sex crimes. That is why, in 2017, then-Gov. Jerry Brown signed into law another Wiener bill. Senate Bill 239 reduced the penalties for someone knowingly exposing another person to HIV through sex. It also lessened the penalties for knowingly donating blood infected with HIV.\n\nUnder previous California law, both of those acts were felonies. HIV is a fatal disease, after all. It has no known cure and requires daily treatment to keep at bay. Someone deliberately concealing the fact that they have HIV, having sex with someone, and giving that person HIV is a heinous act. California previously gave those criminals a prison sentence of three to eight years.\n\nAh, but the stigma. According to Wiener, “These laws were based on fear and on the limited medical understanding of the time. … In the decades since, societal and medical understanding of HIV has greatly improved. Effective treatments dramatically lengthen and improve the quality of life for people living with HIV — treatments that also nearly eliminate the possibility of transmission.”\n\nDo you notice those keywords when talking about treatments? “Lengthen and improve the quality of life,” and “nearly eliminate the possibility of transmission.” Those are euphemistic ways of saying that HIV affects your quality of life and your lifespan, and that treatment is necessary to lessen those effects.\n\nAgain, none of this is about people who simply have HIV — it is in the context of people who deliberately expose an unknowing person to HIV, taking advantage of them and saddling them with a lifelong condition in the process. Once again, concerns about “stigma” win out over consequences for real sex crimes.\n\nCracking down on sex trafficking? It’s complicated\n\nIn 2023, California Republicans pushed to make child sex trafficking a “serious felony,” strengthening penalties for repeat offenders and making them ineligible for early release from prison. The state Senate, made up of 32 Democrats and just eight Republicans, passed it unanimously. Even Wiener supported it.\n\nDemocrats on the Assembly Public Safety Committee blocked the bill, though. It created such a public backlash that Newsom had to lean on Assembly Democrats to push the bill through. A few apologies and abstaining votes later, the bill passed, but not before Assembly Democrats justified their opposition by claiming that punishing child sex traffickers was racist and that they were fighting to “ensure equity.”\n\nThe next year, California Republicans tried to handle this issue from the other side of the transaction, this time trying to make it a felony to purchase or solicit a child for sex. The bill would have upgraded the sentence from one year in jail to up to four years in prison, increased the fine by $15,000, and required purchasers to register as sex offenders for up to 10 years. That bill passed overwhelmingly, but Democratic amendments to the bill ensured that it only applied in cases where the victim was 15 or younger or 16 or 17 and a victim of sex trafficking.\n\nEarlier this year, Assembly Democrat Maggy Krell tried to tighten up the law, making it a felony to purchase a 16- or 17-year-old for sex even if they hadn’t been trafficked. Her fellow Democrats demanded she remove that part of the bill, and then removed her from her own bill, hijacking it for their own purposes. They instead wanted to hold an “informational hearing” about whether purchasing a minor for sex was bad in every possible scenario.\n\nSure enough, Wiener reared his head to put forward an absurd hypothetical. According to him, “Sending an 18-year-old high school senior to state prison for offering his 17-year-old classmate $20 to fool around isn’t smart criminal justice policy.” One would venture a guess that this is not exactly a common practice in high schools. Perhaps this is some cultural difference in San Francisco.\n\nDEAR CALIFORNIA DEMOCRATS: BUYING MINORS FOR SEX SHOULD ALWAYS BE A FELONY\n\nWiener intends to replace former Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) in the House of Representatives. Rob Bonta, the California attorney general, is running for governor. His wife was one of the Assembly Democrats who tried to tank the sex trafficking bill. Newsom is the likely Democratic nominee for president in 2028, and his poll numbers in the early parts of that race are rivaled only by fellow Californian and former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nThis issue is only going to become more relevant as the major players in California gain bigger roles in the Democratic Party. On sex crimes and a number of other issues, California is the crystal ball into the U.S.’s future under Democratic leadership.","summary":"In Focus delivers deeper coverage of the political, cultural, and ideological issues shaping America.

Neither version appeared to contain Trump raging over questions about Changpeng 'CZ' Zhao, the billionaire he pardoned after a $2billion crypto deal was struck with the Trump family.\n\nAccording to the X account, the clip was the \"FULL\" 60 Minutes interview \"without the network's edits and cuts.\" An editor's note on the news show's YouTube upload of the extended interview explained it was \"condensed for clarity.\" While the intense exchange between Trump and O'Donnell did not appear on the edited or \"full\" versions, it was included in the transcript.\n\n\"Actually, 60 Minutes paid me a lotta money. And you don’t have to put this on, because I don't wanna embarrass you, and I'm sure you're not,\" Trump told O'Donnell. \n\nHe continued: \"But 60 Minutes was forced to pay me a lot of money because they took (Kamala Harris') answer out that was so bad, it was election-changing, two nights before the election. And they put a new answer in. And they paid me a lot of money for that. You can't have fake news. You've gotta have legit news. And I think that it's happening.\"The controversial politician previously sued CBS over editing of a 60 Minutes interview with then-Vice President Harris, which he claimed had been edited to help her chances in the presidential election... after she took over for Joe Biden. The network ended up settling with Trump for $16million.\n\nAt the beginning of Sunday's interview, O'Donnell told viewers Paramount had settled the lawsuit, but made clear “the settlement did not include an apology or admission of wrongdoing.\"\n\nHowever, CBS also kept out Trump's having a meltdown over Zhao's pardon, who was released from prison in September after pleading guilty to money-laundering violations.\n\nIn the aired version, Trump claimed he had \"no idea\" who the billionaire was, and added, \"I know he got a four-month sentence or something like that, and I heard it was a Biden witch hunt...\"Trump's Tantrum Over 'Corruption' QuestionBut when O'Donnell, 51, asked if Trump was \"concerned about the appearance of corruption\" over pardoning Zhao due to the links to his family, the transcript revealed the former reality star went over the edge.\n\n\" can't say, because... I can't say. I'm not concerned. I don't... I'd rather not have you ask the question. But I let you ask it. You just came to me and you said, 'Can I ask another question?’ And I said, yeah. This is the question... \"\n\nTrump continued his tantrum: \"I don't mind. Did I let you do it? I coulda have walked away. I didn't have to answer this question. I'm proud to answer the question. You know why? We've taken crypto.. Excuse me. We're number one in crypto in the whole world. Other people wanna be. They're fighting like hell to be.

Kroger is about 1.5 miles on the edge of my neighborhood. Even if the Tesla consumed 5 miles of battery to go the 3 mile round trip, I figured the car could do 50 trips before needing to be charged, more if multiple orders could go in one trip.\n\nAnother idea was a scheduled run to take people to the store, running every hour the car would drive through the neighborhood then to the store to drop off/pick up people. Like a neighborhood shuttle bus.\n\nIt would've been so sweet, but then Tesla added TLS encryption and I couldn't man-in-the-middle capture the data traffic from my phone anymore. The Smart Summoning worked differently from other actions like unlocking doors, playing music etc. It sent streaming data that needed to be handled but it would never let me trigger it. Once they added the TLS, I was at a dead end.\n\nFor the woman in the article, her efforts will never be profitable.

Gennaro will.\n\nAnd apparently the New York Post will post the names of the people who are doing their civic duty, and not the companies whose drivers habitually keep their vehicles idling. A friend of mine used to report idlers pretty regularly practically as a side gig (in fact I'm a little surprised he didn't make it onto the list in TFA), and he's been beaten up by the driver he was filming at least once; so when the guy in the article says \"it's hard work\", he's not wrong.\n\nBut DEP officials said the anti-idling whistleblowers are focusing their attention on the city's core business areas such as Midtown and Lower Manhattan, wealthier Brooklyn neighborhoods and western Queens - not exactly the \"environmental justice communities\" such as Harlem, the South Bronx, Brooklyn's East New York and Brownsville and Staten Island's North Shore.\n\nI suspect that the core areas are getting more reports because that's where the people who do the reporting - and who can afford to do the reporting - live. If you live in the \"core areas\", your commute might be less than half an hour a day. If you live in East New York and have a job in Midtown, you're looking at two hours on the trains a day. That's a lot less time for extracurricular activities.\n\nMy aforementioned friend also told me that there's a lot of hoops you have to jump through to get DEP to pay out, and you might not see the money for months if not years. Said friend is a lawyer so he knows how to keep fighting for his money, but Joe Schmoe who maybe just wants to make an opportunistic buck, it might be too much work to make it a regular thing.\n\n(1) Funniest\n\nmeanmutton: It seems like they would be better off just hiring a few civil servants and having them hang out in areas where the problem is the worst.\n\nI'm convinced that a place like NYC could probably balance its budget if they just hired more people to write parking tickets.\n\nThe problem is that conservatives don't want the government to hire anyone to do anything because government bad, and the leftists think enforcing any law short of rape/murder is unfair unless the person breaking the law is a billionaire or a corporation. So you wind up with things like weird bounty-hunter programs as workarounds.\n\n(1) Funniest\n\nI think they should expand it. Parking in fire lanes, double parking, saving a space, driving a Bronco.

The bounty program really is the best angle, as it's win-win for the city and the populace - zero labor cost, financial reward for the hunters (which should be available to everybody), and hopefully a reduction of smog. Everybody wins.\n\nAdding labor just installs bureaucracy, and adds layers of administration that simply don't need to exist. Labor, taxes, insurance, union involvement, corruption, administration and management (but I repeat myself), etc.\n\nNever add labor where grass roots will suffice. Sounds like it was successful, and merely needed to be applied in a larger net. The city just doesn't want to share the revenue they are otherwise receiving for very little cost (operating the reporting system and issuing fines). This is killing the goose who lays the golden egg.\n\nJeebus Saves \n\n(0) Funniest\n\n45 minutes ago\n\nI May Be Crazy But...: Jeebus Saves: SpectroBoy: Jeebus Saves: edmo: I applaud their initiative.\n\nNow, is someone really going to get on here and defend idling in the city?\n\nCan you really not come up with a valid reason why you would want to leave the bus running for more than 3 minutes?\n\nGive some examples.\n\nMiddle of July, bus pulls up and is waiting for passengers.\n\nA school bus in July?\n\nEver hear of summer school or summer camp?

Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears' campaign spent millions of dollars on ads attacking Democratic nominee and former Rep. Abigail Spanberger for her stance on transgender rights in Virginia schools. \n\nOne ad claims Spanberger supports \"men in girls' locker rooms,\" and closes with the notion that \"Abigail Spanberger is for they/them, not us\" -- a direct echo of an ad the Trump campaign used against Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nThe 2025 Virginia gubernatorial election will be held on Tuesday, Nov. 4. The incumbent Republican governor, Glenn Youngkin, assumed office in 2022 and is ineligible to run for re-election.\n\nThe debate over trans rights also played a role in Youngkin's 2021 campaign. Youngkin has rolled back accommodations for trans students and increased parental notification requirements during his time in office.\n\nNicole Neily, president and founder of the nonprofit Defending Education, said that the focus on this issue in Virginia began with Youngkin's race, which he won by championing parental rights in Virginia schools. \n\n\"This is an issue that has been on the radar of parents across Virginia,\" Neily told ABC News. However, she added that in this particular race, she \"can't see this flipping the election by any stretch.\"\n\nThroughout the race, Earle-Sears has continued the Youngkin administration's focus on the issue, she told ABC News in a statement.\n\n\"This is about fairness, safety, and opportunity,\" she said in the statement. \"As governor, I will preserve those rights and protect our children's future. Voters know that, and they know I mean it because I've been standing with them since 2021, and I will keep standing with them as Governor.\"\n\n\"We see it's about $30 million worth of attack ads against me related to trans youth,\" the Democrat told Katie Couric in an interview last week. \"There's a real effort to engage in some level of fearmongering.\"\n\nSpanberger's campaign did not respond to ABC News' requests for comment.\n\n\"I do find it really objectionable that there would be kids who turn on the television and as in an effort to attack me, see images of themselves sort of reflected as a villain,\" Spanberger added. \"I really do believe that a lot of these choices, whether it's sports participation or bathroom usage, needs to be made at the very local level with parents and teachers and administrators and not necessarily dictated -- certainly not by the federal government -- or the state government.\"\n\nIn a recent ad her campaign released that appeared to be in response to the Earle-Sears team's ones, Spanberger spoke to this directly.\n\n\"I believe we need to get politics out of our schools and trust parents and local communities,\" she said.\n\nSpanberger has maintained her lead against Earle-Sears, as Virginians cite issues like inflation and threats to democracy as some of their biggest concerns in the election, according to a recent poll from Christopher Newport University. \n\nFurthermore, Virginia is home to over 300,000 federal workers, who have likely been affected by the actions taken by Trump's Department of Government Efficiency and the current government shutdown. \n\nVirginia-based Republican strategist Tucker Martin believes that beyond Earle-Sears' closing strategy, the current political environment in Virginia meant that her campaign for governor was \"uphill from the start.\"\n\n\"Any Republican who is going to be the Republican nominee for governor in this cycle -- with Trump back in the White House in a state that he's lost three straight times by significant margins -- was going to be in big trouble,\" Martin told ABC News.\n\nMartin doesn't think Earle-Sears' focus on trans rights has resonated \"at all\" among voters.\n\n\"Transgender issues just aren't top of mind for Virginians right now,\" he said.\n\n\"What works well in Florida or Wisconsin may not work well in Virginia or New Jersey,\" Martin added, invoking another hotly contested gubernatorial race this year. However, Martin said that it could prove to be a \"powerful issue\" in \"competitive congressional races.\"\n\nWith the 2026 midterms fast-approaching, and Republicans seeking to maintain their control of both chambers of Congress and Democrats hoping to flip some seats, the political salience of culture war debates like this one is something that both parties will be paying attention to.\n\n\"Republicans have given in to the most extreme fringes of their party by abandoning pocketbook issues in favor of an anti-freedom agenda that is obsessed with letting politicians make decisions that should be left to parents and doctors,\" DCCC spokesperson Viet Shelton told ABC News in a statement.\n\n\"Rather than getting involved in personal matters, House Republicans should perhaps spend their time expanding the middle class, lowering costs, and protecting freedoms,\" Shelton's statement continued. \"That's certainly what House Democrats are focused on -- and it's why we'll win in 2026.\" \n\nSpanberger has been able to avoid addressing the debate head-on in this race, often pointing to her experience investigating child predators as a federal law enforcement officer and her belief that such decisions should be left up to local communities. \n\nAccording to Martin, this question is something that Democrats like Spanberger will need to shore up their stances on in upcoming elections in other states or districts.\n\n\"I wouldn't say the Spanberger campaign has handled it well, but what they have going for them is it's just not an issue in Virginia that voters are particularly concerned about,\" Martin said.","summary":"Republican Winsome Earle-Sears has brought the culture war over trans rights to Richmond in the final days of the Virginia gubernatorial race.","url":"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/republican-leans-anti-trans-rights-ads-virginia-governor/story?id=127075416","image":"https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/24df024f-d9b1-4c70-aeee-8eb082ce2f17/virginia-gty-er-251031_1761949329563_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-03 18:18:00","author":"Halle Troadec","authors":["Halle Troadec"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.016},{"id":375395298,"title":"Kelly Clarkson Extends 2026 Vegas Residency Ahead of First Show Since Brandon Blackstock’s Death","text":"Skip to main content\n\nNovember 3, 2025\n\nKelly Clarkson\n\nDenise Truscello*\n\nAhead of her return to Las Vegas this week, Kelly Clarkson has announced a new set of summer 2026 dates for her “Studio Sessions” residency at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace.\n\nClarkson has added four new dates for next August to her calendar, to go along with the six 2026 shows she’d already announced. The run will start July 17 and end Aug. 15. Tickets for the newly added dates will go on sale Nov. 7 at 10 a.m. PT, with a presale scheduled to start Nov. 5 at 10 a.m. PT. A limited number of tickets for Clarkson’s previously announced concerts are on sale now. \n\nClarkson announced her Studio Sessions residency earlier this year but abruptly postponed the run’s first few shows hours before opening night, July 4. In an Instagram post, Clarkson said preparing for the shows had “taken a toll” on her voice, and that she needed to rest to prevent “doing serious damage.” \n\nClarkson did return the following weekend as planned and performed eight gigs at the Colosseum, but then had to step away again in early August after revealing that her ex-husband, Brandon Blackstock, was ill. Blackstock died on Aug. 7, with the cause later revealed to be melanoma, a type of skin cancer. \n\nIn the months after Blackstock’s death, Clarkson kept a low profile but has steadily returned to the public eye. In late September, she returned to her daytime talk show, opening the episode with a cover of the Weeknd’s “Blinding Lights.” She’s set to return to the stage later this week, Nov. 7, for the first of four previously scheduled Studio Sessions shows. The other gigs will take place Nov. 8, 14, and 15. \n\nTrending Stories\n\nGrateful Dead Singer Donna Jean Godchaux Dead at 78\n\nLawsuit Against Spotify Claims ‘Billions’ of Drake Streams Were ‘Fraudulent’\n\nGeorge Clooney Says It Was a ‘Mistake’ for Kamala Harris to Replace Joe Biden in Election\n\nRussell Simmons Owed Millions to His Accusers.

Jones, who envisioned the murder of former House Speaker Todd Gilbert and his children – and also faces an ongoing criminal investigation stemming from his 116-mph reckless driving charge – avoided mentioning those scandals and instead slammed President Donald Trump during his remarks. The appearance tied Obama and Spanberger to Jones — a move critics said undercuts the former president’s past calls for civility and his 2024 comments urging Black voters to support Vice President Kamala Harris. \"They endorse killing us,\" Florida political journalist Eric Daugherty said of Obama’s appearance with Jones. WATCH: KAINE DEFENDS JONES AMID AG CANDIDATE’S TEXTS ENVISIONING MURDER OF GOP LEADER: ‘STILL A SUPPORTER’ \"In a disgusting sight, Virginia AG candidate Jay Jones — who called for the murder of Republicans and their children — is being cheered at a Barack Hussein Obama rally with gubernatorial candidate Abigail Spanberger,\" Daugherty said. Obama notably did not mention Jones by name, Fox News’ Steve Doocy reported Monday, before asking Republican Winsome Earle-Sears herself about the spectacle. \"I’m from a country where I saw political violence, where I see political gangs shooting people and shooting each other when I was 10 years old,\" said Earle-Sears, who was born in Kingston, Jamaica. SOCIAL MEDIA ERUPTS AFTER DISGRACED DEM NOMINEE LEANS ON TRUMP ATTACKS IN VIRGINIA AG DEBATE \"And to think that that's what I'm seeing in America today, it is absolutely crazy. And for my opponent, Abigail Spanberger, to not tell her attorney general nominee ... Jay Jones, to get out of the race because he said two bullets to the head of his political opponents and also kill the man's 2-year-old and 5-year-old children, this cannot be what we are about in Virginia.\" At an appearance with Earle-Sears in Purcellville, Loudoun County, Gov. Glenn Youngkin called Obama and Spanberger’s appearance with Jones \"a great representation of the far-left’s embrace of violence.\" \"I cannot believe that Jay Jones was there, but Abigail Spanberger is for him, Barack Obama is for him,\" Youngkin said. JAY JONES MURDER TEXTS LATEST CASE OF DEMOCRATS CIRCLING THE SCANDAL WAGONS The outgoing governor separately called Jones \"demented,\" and wrote that any shred of moral clarity left in the Democratic Party was \"laid bare.\" \"Virginians clearly saw [during the rally] that violence and murder are just fine with them. Those may be their values, but they aren’t Virginia values.\" Former Chicago Bear–turned–options trader Jon Najarian asked on X how Obama and the NAACP — for whom Jones reportedly completed 500 hours of community service following his I-64 offense — could \"turn a blind eye to Jay Jones’ sick comments as he campaigned for the chief legal position in the state.\" JAY JONES INVOKES TRUMP NEARLY 50 TIMES DURING VIRGINIA AG DEBATE, TIES MIYARES TO ‘MAGA’ Conservative commentator Western Lensman called out Obama’s remarks during the rally as blatantly hypocritical. Obama told the crowd that Spanberger knows that people should be \"able to disagree without calling each other nasty names or demonizing each other.\" The attorney general candidate present at that same rally characterized House Speaker Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah, as worse than dictators Pol Pot and Adolf Hitler – and expressed a wish to urinate on Gilbert’s grave. LIBERAL MEDIA DOWNPLAYS SCANDAL OF DEM VIRGINIA AG HOPEFUL JAY JONES' TEXTS FANTASIZING MURDER OF GOP LAWMAKER \"Yes, Jay ‘I want to murder Republicans and their children’ Jones shared this very stage with Obama because he was invited to do so [and] remains an endorsed member of the Dems’ ticket,\" added Fox News contributor Guy Benson in a reply to Lensman. \"Obama doesn’t even believe his faux high-minded bulls---, but this is his autopilot slop,\" Benson added. Another X commenter noted that comic Roseanne Barr was fired from her ABC sitcom after describing Obama confidante Valerie Jarrett as a cross between the Muslim Brotherhood and \"Planet of the Apes\" -- but Democrats remain steadfast in their support of someone like Jones. Critics also locked onto Obama’s apparent change of heart about Black candidates running for office. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP \"Obama rallied with psycho Jay Jones today,\" quipped former AFP Vice President Phil Kerpen. Jones was also defended once again by Virginia House Speaker Don Scott Jr., D-Portsmouth, who was interviewed by former NBC anchor Chuck Todd. Scott told Todd that if Jones wins, he believes Virginia will \"allow him to do his job and move on,\" calling him a \"good young man who made a huge error.\" Scott previously told reporters after Spanberger's debate with Earle-Sears that people concerned with Jones should instead look to Trump's comments about former Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo. Trump had claimed Cheney's neoconservative and interventionist political bent would be less pronounced if she was in the same \"warzone\" as U.S. servicemembers and had enemy rifles pointed her way.","summary":"Critics slam Obama&apos;s Virginia rally appearance alongside Jay Jones, who envisioned murdering political opponents and their children, calling it &quot;the far-left’s embrace of violence.&quot;","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/they-endorse-killing-us-obama-spanberger-slammed-stumping-murder-texting-jay-jones","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/11/obama-spanberger.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-03 18:15:09","author":"Charles Creitz","authors":["Charles Creitz"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.244},{"id":375395296,"title":"Hilary Duff Announces ‘Mature’ — Her First Single in a Decade","text":"Skip to main content\n\nNovember 3, 2025\n\nHilary Duff\n\nMADELYN DEUTCH*\n\nHilary Duff recently promised fans new music will arrive “in the blink of an eye” — and she wasn’t joking.

He also praised Mamdani's campaign.\n\nThe call, first reported by the New York Times, was confirmed by Mamdani’s spokesperson.\n\n\"Zohran Mamdani appreciated President Obama’s words of support and their conversation on the importance of bringing a new kind of politics to our city,” said Mamdani spokesperson Dora Pekec.\n\nMamdani, a Uganda-born state assembly member, has polled well ahead of his main rival, Cuomo, ahead of the November 4 general election.\n\nHe has won endorsements from party holdouts such as former Vice President Kamala Harris and New York Governor Kathy Hochul, and he has received a steady stream of financial backing from small donors.\n\nMamdani's policies range from hiking taxes on New York City's wealthiest, raising the corporation tax, freezing stabilized apartment rental rates, and increasing publicly subsidized housing, raising worries among the finance community that the city's competitiveness will suffer.\n\nCuomo is trying to make his return to political office after resigning as governor four years ago following a barrage of sexual harassment accusations that he denies. Now running as an independent, the 67-year-old has in recent days shifted to wooing Republican voters to bolster his centrist base, pitching himself as the only candidate who can stop Mamdani.\n\nSliwa, the creator of the Guardian Angels crime patrol group, and a longtime fixture on New York's airwaves, wants to spoil both their chances. He's been heavily canvassing the streets and subways in his signature red beret to spread his message of public safety.\n\nRISKS AND REWARDS\n\nMamdani's rise presents both risks and rewards for the national Democratic Party, which acknowledges the need to appeal to young voters, but could become more vulnerable to Republican attacks due to Mamdani’s criticism of Israel and his Democratic socialism.\n\nNew York City's mayoral race is always watched closely as the city is the nation's financial capital and its leaders' decisions often influence national political discourse, at least for the locally dominant Democratic Party.\n\nVoters in New York City, New Jersey, Virginia, and California will cast ballots on Tuesday for a mayor, two governors, and a redistricting measure - early tests of Democratic and Republican strategies ahead of next year's congressional midterm election.","summary":"","url":"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/nyc-mayoral-candidates-make-final-push-ahead-election-day-5442856","image":"https://dam.mediacorp.sg/image/upload/s--XJmaNEy5--/c_fill,g_auto,h_338,w_600/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_one-cms:core:watermark:ap_data-1,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/v1/one-cms/core/Election_2025_New_York_Mayor_16745.jpg?itok=Uk_6ycvE","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-03 17:56:24","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"SG","sentiment":0.132},{"id":375395302,"title":"AC/DC Extend ‘Power Up’ Tour With 2026 Dates","text":"Skip to main content\n\nNovember 3, 2025\n\nBrian Johnson and Angus Young of AC/DC perform on Aug. 21, 2025 in Edinburgh, Scotland.\n\nRoberto Ricciuti/Getty Images\n\nAC/DC are cranking up the energy on their Power Up tour.

GQ's Zach Baron asked Colbert to respond to Democratic lawmakers such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who have both wanted to find out if his show was canceled for political reasons. CBS announced in July that it would be canceling \"The Late Show\" and that Colbert's program would end in May 2026. CBS has said it was a purely financial decision. \"I mean, that’s not my job. That’s not my reaction to it. My reaction as a professional in show business is to go: That is the network’s decision,\" Colbert responded. COLBERT WINS EMMY FOR 'LATE SHOW' AFTER CANCELLATION, SAYS HE LOVES HIS COUNTRY MORE THAN EVER \"I can understand why people would have that reaction because CBS or the parent corporation — I’m not going to say who made that decision, because I don’t know; no one’s ever going to tell us — decided to cut a check for $16 million to the president of the United States over a lawsuit that their own lawyers, Paramount’s own lawyers, said is completely without merit. And it is self-evident that that is damaging to the reputation of the network, the corporation, and the news division,\" he said. He said theories associated with the settlement and his employment were \"reasonable\" to think. \"But my side of the street is clean, and I have no interest in picking up a broom or adding to refuse on the other side of the street. Not my problem. So people can have their theories. I have my feelings about not doing the show anymore, but you’d have to show me why that’s a fruitful relationship for me to have with my network for the next nine months, for me to engage in that speculation,\" Colbert continued. Colbert is a strong Democratic Party supporter and helped fundraise for former President Joe Biden. KIMMEL SLAMS CBS OVER COLBERT CANCELLATION, RIPS INTO TRUMP AS A ‘DELICATE, CHUBBY LITTLE TEACUP’ The news of Colbert's cancellation came two days after CBS News settled with President Donald Trump in his lawsuit for $16 million against the network over their handling of a \"60 Minutes\" interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris. Colbert weighed in on the lawsuit during his show, and accused his employer of offering a \"big fat bribe\" to the president.

Just put it in, because it’s the first thing that I was looking for,” the insider added.\n\n“And actually ‘60 Minutes’ paid me a lotta money,” Trump declared in an unaired portion of the interview, which was published online. He also informed interviewer, Norah O’Donnell, that “you don't have to put this on” because he didn’t “wanna embarrass” her.\n\nTrump then said that CBS News has a “great, new leader” who is “leading your whole enterprise,” referring to Weiss – whom he made a point of saying he didn't personally know. \n\n“I don't know her, but I hear she's a great person,” he declared, without saying Weiss’ name. “But ‘60 Minutes’ was forced to pay me a lot of money because they took her answer out that was so bad, it was election-changing, two nights before the election. And they put a new answer in. And they paid me a lot of money for that. You can't have fake news. You've gotta have legit news. And I think that it's happening.”\n\nThough “60 Minutes” did not air that portion, O’Donnell referenced the lawsuit at the top of the broadcast, adding that the network did not apologize as part of the settlement.\n\nThe Independent has contacted CBS News for comment.\n\nThe president sued CBS News last year over a “60 Minutes” interview with Kamala Harris, accusing the network of deceptively editing the segment to make the then-Democratic presidential nominee look better ahead of the 2024 election. Despite what the president claimed, that interview aired a month before the election, not two days prior.\n\nThough legal experts called the $20 billion lawsuit frivolous and CBS News’ own attorneys denounced it as “without merit,” the network’s parent company Paramount agreed to pay Trump $16 million to settle the complaint. Amid settlement discussions, “60 Minutes” executive producer Bill Owens resigned, suggesting that corporate interference had deprived him of editorial independence.\n\nThe settlement occurred as Paramount was looking to finalize its $8.4 billion merger with Ellison’s Skydance Media, which was approved by the Trump administration shortly after the president was paid.\n\nElsewhere in his sit-down with O’Donnell, which ran for nearly 90 minutes but aired for only 28 minutes on “60 Minutes”, the president lauded both Weiss and Ellison, whose father is Oracle founder and close Trump ally Larry Ellison.\n\n“I see good things happening in the news. I really do,” he cheerfully proclaimed. “And I think one of the best things to happen is this show and new ownership, CBS and new ownership. I think it's the greatest thing that's happened in a long time to a free and open and good press.”\n\nThe irony, of course, is part of the agreement that CBS reached with Trump was that “60 Minutes” would publish the unedited transcripts of any interviews with presidents and presidential candidates – which is precisely what occurred in Trump’s interview with O’Donnell. And it has only opened up the network, and its leadership, to fresh scrutiny over what it decided to excise from the televised portion of the interview.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, for instance, wondered if he “should file a complaint with the FCC against the Trump White House for editing his unhinged ‘60 Minutes’ interview,” adding that the lawsuit would “use the exact same language Trump lodged against Vice President Harris.”\n\nMarc Elias, a Democratic election litigation attorney who appeared on “60 Minutes” a few months ago to discuss Trump’s attacks on law firms, noted that the network “chose not to air” the president’s comments praising Weiss and Ellison while boasting about his settlement. “It probably explains much of what they did decide to air,” he added.\n\n“Perfect. ‘60 Minutes’ edited out an important part of its Trump interview in which he boasts about extracting millions from its parent company on an utterly meritless claim . . . that ‘60 Minutes’ selectively edited its Kamala Harris interview,” journalist, Radley Balko, also observed.\n\nThe much-anticipated Sunday night sit-down was conducted a year after the president filed his lawsuit against the network over the Harris interview and five years after his last “60 Minutes” appearance. Unlike his contentious 2020 interview with Lesley Stahl, which featured several blowups, Trump’s conversation with O’Donnell showed him largely at ease – though there were tense moments.\n\n“It showed he sensed he was sitting down with a friendly news organization. That was the tone that he seemed to convey. Not them, but him,” CNN anchor Audie Cornish pointed out Monday morning.\n\n“The last time Trump appeared on ‘60 Minutes,’ in Oct. 2020, he did walk away after being annoyed by questions from Lesley Stahl,” TheWrap’s Michael Calderone wrote. “But on this occasion, Trump stuck around, and given his gushing about the new regime at CBS News, it seems likely he’ll be willing to return.” \n\nMediaite’s Colby Hall, meanwhile, stated that “Trump acted like management” when he told O’Donnell during the unedited interview that the network didn’t have to use some of his answers in the final edit.\n\nO’Donnell, who has been aggressively lobbying Weiss to regain her perch atop “CBS Evening News”, received plaudits from some media analysts for her interview with the president. CNN’s Brian Stelter, for instance, wrote that “it was not exactly a cushy interview” and her “questions generated lots of news.”\n\nCBS staffers, who spoke with The Independent, noted that “Trump is literally taking a victory lap” after the sit-down, pointing to the White House’s press release touting the president’s “powerhouse interview” that revealed the “remarkable successes” of his administration.\n\nOne network reporter said that it felt like CBS News had “lost control journalistically and become a PR tool” in the wake of the interview. Still, they asserted that they also would not have aired Trump praising network leadership and bragging about his “60 Minutes” payoff.\n\n“The president already behaves like a schoolyard bully,” the reporter said. “I wouldn’t have included him gloating over how he took the network’s lunch money and installed a puppet regime over CBS News.”\n\nThe Trump interview comes amid a tumultuous time at CBS News, which is not only coming to terms with a perceived rightward shift editorially but has also seen crippling layoffs decimate much of its news operation. \n\nAs part of Paramount’s first round of cuts under the new Ellison regime, the network canceled two streaming programs, gutted its Saturday morning news show, eliminated its race and culture unit and lost roughly 100 staffers – including eight on-air personalities, all of whom are female. \n\nDays before the Trump administration approved the Paramount merger, Skydance had promised the FCC that the new company would get rid of all diversity programs and initiatives.\n\nSince taking over the company, Ellison has made sweeping changes to the CBS newsroom that have sparked criticism that he’s currying favor with Trump. \n\nBesides hiring the “anti-woke” Weiss, and purchasing her center-right digital outlet The Free Press, Ellison has installed a former Trump appointee and right-wing think tank leader as ombudsman to root out “complaints of bias” at CBS News. The network has also revamped its editing guidelines for its Sunday show, “Face the Nation”, following complaints from the White House.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has repeatedly lavished praise on Ellison and his father following the merger. “I think the news is getting better. They‘re learning that they have no credibility,” he exclaimed in August. “CBS was just sold to a great person that I know very well… A great man. He actually just bought CBS. And I think he‘s going to do the right thing with it.”","summary":"‘Why would you subject yourself to this type of criticism?

The residency — named TM:101 Live after his hit album from 2005, Let’s Get It: Thug Motivation 101 — is taking place at PH Live at Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino.\n\nAt the Nov. 1 show, Guinness World Records adjudicator Andy Glass personally presented Jeezy with an official certificate marking the achievement. “This isn’t just a win for me — it’s a moment for the culture, for music, and for Vegas,” Jeezy said while accepting the honor, according to a press release. “Thank you to every musician, every fan, and everyone who believed we could take this all the way. A winner is a dreamer who never gave up!” He went on to thank the massive team behind him: “Thank you to all 101 orchestra members, composer Derrick Hodge, musical director Adam Blackstone, DJ Drama, DJ Ace and most importantly, the fans.”\n\nTrending Stories\n\nGrateful Dead Singer Donna Jean Godchaux Dead at 78\n\nLawsuit Against Spotify Claims ‘Billions’ of Drake Streams Were ‘Fraudulent’\n\nGeorge Clooney Says It Was a ‘Mistake’ for Kamala Harris to Replace Joe Biden in Election\n\nRussell Simmons Owed Millions to His Accusers.

The residency will continue with Nutcracker-themed shows on Dec. 19 and 21.\n\nLast February, Jeezy made his NPR Tiny Desk debut backed by a full band. “I’m gonna take y’all on a journey so y’all can see how I got from there to here, to Tiny Desk,” Jeezy told the crowd at NPR’s Washington, D.C. office. “I used to stand on a tiny porch.
