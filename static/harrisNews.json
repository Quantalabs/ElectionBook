In 2024, former \"SEAL Team\" script coordinator and writer Brian Beneker sued Paramount Global, CBS Entertainment and CBS Studios for unlawful discrimination for repeatedly denying him career advancement based on his race, sex and sexual orientation. According to America First Legal (AFL), who represented Beneker in the case, both sides ultimately agreed to a settlement after what AFL senior counsel Nick Barry described as satisfactory moves by Paramount to publicly back away from diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) polices. '60 MINUTES' PRODUCER'S ABRUPT EXIT FUELS DRAMA AT CBS NEWS AS NETWORK BATTLES TRUMP LAWSUIT \"America First Legal is pleased to see Paramount and CBS publicly back off their DEI requirements and return to merit-based considerations. Diversity quotas that discriminate on the basis of race are unlawful. Others in the entertainment industry should take note,\" Barry said in a statement on Monday. Fox News Digital reached out to CBS and Paramount for comment. An AFL spokesperson also told Fox News Digital that there will be no further legal action in the case. The original lawsuit claimed that, despite working on the show since its first season in 2017, Beneker was repeatedly denied promotion to full-time staff writer while minority writers were hired with little to no experience. When confronting the showrunner, Beneker claimed he was told that he did not \"check any diversity boxes\" to warrant advancement. The AFL also cited past comments from then-CBS CEO George Cheeks in 2020 announcing efforts to ensure 40% of all writers’ rooms have \"BIPOC representation\" for the 2021-22 season, with the goal of increasing the figure to 50% for the 2022-23 season. In February 2025, Paramount Global heads informed employees that it would be rolling back these initiatives in the wake of Trump’s re-election and anti-DEI policies. This included no longer using \"aspirational numerical goals\" for hiring and ending its policy of collecting race, ethnicity, sex or gender data of potential applicants except when legally required. CNN'S JAKE TAPPER RIPS PARAMOUNT OWNER AS CBS FIGHTS HIGH-STAKES LEGAL BATTLE WITH TRUMP This announcement came as Paramount Global agreed to mediation with Trump’s legal team earlier this month, signaling a settlement of the $20 billion lawsuit against them. Trump is seeking $20 billion in a lawsuit against CBS, alleging election interference over its handling of a \"60 Minutes\" interview last year with then-Vice President Kamala Harris. The president accused the network of aiding his 2024 Democratic opponent through deceptive editing just weeks before the presidential election.

TOP '60 MINUTES' PRODUCER RESIGNS FROM SHOW, CITES LACK OF INDEPENDENCE Trump is seeking $20 billion in a lawsuit against CBS, alleging election interference over its handling of a \"60 Minutes\" interview last year with then-Vice President Kamala Harris. The president accused CBS of aiding his 2024 Democratic opponent through deceptive editing just weeks before the presidential election. CBS’ parent company, Paramount Global, agreed to mediation, signaling their courtroom feud will result in a settlement. Owens announced to his colleagues on Tuesday he's removing himself from the newsroom drama. \"Over the past months, it has also become clear that I would not be allowed to run the show as I have always run it. To make independent decisions based on what was right for 60 Minutes, right for the audience,\" Owens wrote in a memo obtained by Fox News Digital. \"So, having defended this show – and what we stand for – from every angle, over time with everything I could, I am stepping aside so the show can move forward.\" \"The show is too important to the country, it has to continue, just not with me as the Executive Producer,\" he said. TRUMP, CBS PARENT COMPANY SET FOR MEDIATION IN $20 BILLION ‘60 MINUTES’ LAWSUIT It's been previously reported that Shari Redstone, Paramount’s controlling shareholder, has been in favor of settling Trump's lawsuit in order to help clear the path for Paramount's merger with Skydance. Owens expressed concern about a recent uptick in oversight from CBS executives during an internal meeting on Tuesday when informing staffers of his abrupt exit, according to The New York Times. Leading up to his exit, Redstone reportedly \"kept tabs\" on which upcoming \"60 Minutes\" segments were about Trump. While a spokesperson for Redstone told Semafor neither she nor Paramount sought to kill stories, one source told Semafor that Redstone had been privately and publicly critical of \"60 Minutes\" in recent months. The lawsuit stems from an exchange Harris had with \"60 Minutes\" correspondent Bill Whitaker, who asked her why Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wasn't \"listening\" to the Biden administration. Harris was widely mocked for the \"word salad\" answer that aired in a preview clip of the interview on \"Face the Nation.\" However, when Whitaker asked the same question during the primetime special, Harris had a different, more concise response. Critics at the time accused CBS News of editing Harris' \"word salad\" answer to shield the then-vice president from further backlash leading up to Election Day. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Earlier this year, FCC Chair Brendan Carr ordered CBS News to hand over the unedited transcript of the interview as part of its investigation into whether the network violated the FCC's \"news distortion\" policy after a complaint was filed. CBS had refused to release the unedited transcript when the controversy first began. The released raw transcript and footage showed that both sets of Harris' comments came from the same response, but CBS News had aired only the first half of her response in the \"Face the Nation\" preview clip and aired the second half during the primetime special.","summary":"The anchors of &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; addressed the abrupt exit of &quot;60 Minutes&quot; executive producer Bill Owens as the network continues its legal battle with President Donald Trump.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/cbs-anchors-salute-outgoing-60-minutes-producer-say-effort-settle-trump-lawsuit-tied-corporate-merger","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/04/931/523/cbsanchorsbillowens.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-23 23:08:50","author":"Joseph Wulfsohn","authors":["Joseph Wulfsohn"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.026},{"id":314154570,"title":"Trump's popularity with U.S. voters slumps in opinion polls","text":"U.S. President Donald Trump's popularity has sunk since his riotous return to the White House, polls showed Wednesday, with Americans criticizing him on key issues of the economy and immigration.\n\nThe Republican has unleashed a flood of actions -– from sweeping tariffs to immigration crackdowns –- to deliver on what he considers an overwhelming mandate from U.S. voters.\n\nBut an Economist/YouGov survey found a downward trend in Trump's approval rating, with 41 percent of Americans now signaling support compared to around half in January.\n\nAnother poll, by Pew Research Center, found Trump's job rating has dropped from 47 percent in February to 40 percent today –- significantly lower than his predecessor Joe Biden's score of 59 percent in April 2021.\n\nOverall, Trump's average approval rating of 45 percent in his first three months back in office has been below all other post-World War II presidents elected in the United States, Gallup said last week.\n\nResults also show Americans losing confidence in Trump's ability to handle key issues such as the economy.\n\nVoters last year viewed the 78-year-old billionaire as strong on the economy, but his imposition of sweeping tariffs on trade partners this month has rattled global markets.\n\nSome 54 percent of Americans now feel the economy is getting worse, compared to 37 percent in January, according to the Economist/YouGov poll.\n\nTrump's approval rating is notably lagging on the cost of living, a Reuters/Ipsos survey showed, with just 31 percent of Americans approving of his performance on that issue.\n\nInflation was a hot topic in the November election, with Trump vowing to immediately lower prices as president.\n\nHe has seen a similar downward trend on immigration –- another typically strong area for Trump, who has led a hardline deportation strategy targeting undocumented migrants which has pitted him in legal battles with the courts.\n\nThe Economist/YouGov poll found that 45 percent of Americans approve of how Trump is handling immigration, compared with 50 percent two weeks ago.\n\nPolls also show a drop in support among some key demographics that helped Trump return to power by picking him over Democratic election rival Kamala Harris.\n\nThey include Hispanic voters, whose approval score has dropped from 36 percent in early February to 27 percent, according to the Pew poll.","summary":"U.S. President Donald Trump's popularity has sunk since his riotous return to the White House, polls showed Wednesday, with Americans criticizing him on key issues of the economy…","url":"https://japantoday.com/category/world/trump%27s-popularity-with-us-voters-slumps-in-opinion-polls","image":"https://media.japantoday.com/img/store/76/17/a2c9047519c101058327c3cdc82cab92b9bf/3e5db2779cc08f049b9751e15349ff9d04887993/_w1700.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-23 22:11:01","author":"Japan Today Editor,Pew Research Center","authors":["Japan Today Editor","Pew Research Center"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"jp","sentiment":-0.007},{"id":314146732,"title":"Fox News Poll: The first 100 days of President Trump’s second term","text":"As Donald Trump approaches the 100th day of his second term, a Fox News survey finds voters pleased with the job he is doing on border security, but displeased on most other issues -- including inflation. President Trump receives his best marks on border security, as a 55% majority approves. That’s the only issue where his ratings are in positive territory. On immigration, a record high of 47% approve of Trump (48% disapprove), while a new low of 38% approve on the economy (56% disapprove). His worst ratings are on inflation (33% approve, 59% disapprove), followed by tariffs (33-58%), foreign policy (40-54%), taxes (38-53%), and guns (41-44%). FOX NEWS POLL: TRUMP, REPUBLICANS AT RECORD-HIGH RATINGS AS DEMOCRATS FALTER Overall approval of Trump’s job performance comes in at 44%, down 5 points from 49% approval in March. That’s lower than the approval of Joe Biden (54%), Barack Obama (62%), and George W. Bush (63%) at the 100-day mark in their presidencies. It’s also lower by 1 point compared to Trump’s 45% approval at this point eight years ago. Some 59% of voters are unhappy with how things are going in the country. That’s an improvement since the end of former President Biden’s term (68% dissatisfied), but worse than four years ago at the beginning of Biden’s term (53% dissatisfied). It’s also worse than the 100-day mark of Trump’s first term (53% dissatisfied). Since his inauguration in January, satisfaction among Democrats has turned to dissatisfaction and vice versa among Republicans. Dissatisfaction remained steady among Independents. Voters remain gloomy about the economy, as 71% rate economic conditions negatively and 55% say it is getting worse for their family. Both of those numbers are slight improvements compared to where they stood in December. Still, only 28% say it feels like things are getting better and by a 22-point margin more think Trump’s policies are hurting rather than helping the economy. Trump is underwater by a narrower 11-point margin when voters are asked what they expect from his policies in the long run (40% help vs. 51% hurt). FOX NEWS POLL: VOTERS HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT DOGE, EVEN AS THEY SEE NEED FOR CUTS They are also less optimistic about the future than they were at the beginning of Trump’s first term. Based on the first 100 days, 38% overall and 75% of Republicans say they feel encouraged about the next four years. In 2017, those numbers were 45% and 84%, respectively. While inflation remains a major worry, the 82% who say they are extremely or very concerned about high prices is the lowest since September 2021. This marks a decline from 89% in January and a high of 93% in July 2022. Another 8 in 10 voters are concerned about political divisions (78%), while about 7 in 10 feel the same about health care (76%), government spending (73%), and a recession (72%). Two-thirds or fewer are worried about immigration (66%), Iran getting a nuclear bomb (66%), Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (61%), and the stock market (58%). While there’s bipartisan concern about inflation, the parties are split on other issues. Anxiety about a recession and health care are the other top issues for Democrats, while Republicans worry more about government spending and immigration. \"As we’ve moved from one administration to another and the Trump administration tries to find its footing, many still see our leaders as unresponsive to their main concerns,\" says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts Fox New surveys with Democrat Chris Anderson. \"Partisans have flipped, of course, so now it’s Democrats who are most worried, but many Independents and Republicans are also skeptical their economic fears are being addressed.\" Nearly three-quarters (72%) believe tariffs will drive up the cost of products, including majorities of Democrats (88%), Independents (76%), and Republicans (55%). A record 55% think tariffs hurt the economy and a plurality say they hurt U.S. jobs (44% hurt vs. 36% help). Two-thirds worry a trade war with China could escalate into a military confrontation. On the Department of Government Efficiency’s efforts to reform the federal government, almost half say it’s likely DOGE will make government more efficient (49%), improve the economy (47%), and improve government services (46%), while fewer expect it will lower their taxes (43%). A slight majority, 52%, say the Trump administration has not been \"competent and effective\" in managing the federal government -- unchanged from the number who said the same in 2017. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Federal district court judges have challenged some Trump administration policies with regard to, among other things, firing executive branch workers and deporting illegal immigrants. Voters side with the judges, as 58% think they are legitimately exercising their power in accordance with the Constitution’s system of checks and balances, while 33% say they are unlawfully interfering with the president’s constitutional authority. Two-thirds say the president cannot ignore court rulings, and voters are significantly more concerned, by a 19-point margin, about the president disregarding the judiciary than about the courts overstepping their authority. Among Republicans, 36% agree the judiciary is legitimately exercising its power and a slim 51% majority says the president can’t ignore court rulings. \"While Trump may feel he’s on favorable ground when arguing about immigration with Democrats, there are obvious risks to pushing it too far,\" says Anderson. \"One risk is he is seen as doing it at the expense of economic issues, which concern voters more than immigration. Another is in ignoring the courts and losing supporters who see value in checks and balances.\" CLICK HERE FOR CROSSTABS AND TOPLINE Fewer voters are hoping for Trump’s success in his second term. When asked to set aside how they voted, 62% say they want him to succeed -- an 18-point drop from the 80% who expressed that sentiment eight years ago. While support among Republicans holds steady, with more than 9 in 10 still wishing Trump well, the share of Democrats and Independents who want him to succeed has plummeted by 30 points or more since 2017. Eighty-nine percent of those who supported Trump in 2024 remain satisfied with their choice. That’s down from 92% who felt that way four years ago and 97% eight years ago. Overall, 85% say they are still satisfied with their vote for president, including 90% of Kamala Harris supporters. Poll-pourri Investors are more likely than non-investors to approve of Trump’s job performance on the economy, inflation, tariffs, and taxes, and they rate economic conditions more positively both for the nation and their family. And while more investors are concerned about the stock market, a larger number of non-investors is worried about inflation and a recession this year. Forty-two percent approve of the job JD Vance is doing as vice president, while 51% disapprove. For Elon Musk’s work with DOGE, 39% approve and 56% disapprove. Nearly half of voters have a favorable opinion of Trump as a person: 45% favorable and 55% unfavorable, for a net negative rating of 10 points. Views of first lady Melania Trump are positive by 6 points, as 45% also have favorable opinion of her, while 39% view her unfavorably. In June 2017, 51% viewed the first lady positively, while 47% viewed the president favorably. One-third believe divine intervention helped secure Trump’s return to the White House. Thirty-two percent feel he was saved from two assassination attempts because God wanted him to be president again, including majorities of White evangelical Christians (56%), Republicans (60%), 2024 Trump supporters (62%), and MAGA supporters (70%). Conducted April 18-21, 2025, under the direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R), this Fox News survey includes interviews with a sample of 1,104 registered voters randomly selected from a national voter file. Respondents spoke with live interviewers on landlines (127) and cellphones (703) or completed the survey online after receiving a text (274). Results based on the full sample have a margin of sampling error of ±3 percentage points. Sampling error for results among subgroups is higher. In addition to sampling error, question wording and order can influence results. Weights are generally applied to age, race, education, and area variables to ensure the demographics are representative of the registered voter population. Sources for developing weight targets include the American Community Survey, Fox News Voter Analysis, and voter file data.

Of the 18 photos and videos included in her carousel, just one slide does not feature the beach and/or a horse: a picture of her reading list.\nAnd, boy, is it interesting to read into her picks.\nIn the post’s caption, in which she gushes about how “grateful” she is for the trip (the word “doesn’t begin to cover it,” she insists), Trump describes “logging off and tuning in. Grounding in nature’s rhythm. Feeling the sacred in the silence, in the laughter of my children, in the breath of the trees.”\nIvanka also, in her own words, “read until the sun dipped low.” Three favorites are arrayed on a bedspread: Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow by Gabrielle Zevin, The Women by Kristin Hannah, and The Tell by Amy Griffin. The books have a few things in common: They’re all written by female authors, and feature main characters that could fall under the “strong female lead” umbrella. They are all distinguished members of the New York Times bestseller club. The two fictional entries, Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow and The Women, both had their film rights snapped up in big-deal movie contracts before the books even hit shelves.\nAlthough none of the three authors have openly criticized Ivanka’s dear old dad, Donald Trump, they carry thematic messages that he might not love so much. And the books she read have been praised by other authors and public figures who have spoken publicly against her father.\nTomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow, which was published in 2022, follows two friends and eventual creative collaborators through decades, from childhood to middle age, co-creating a hit video game along the way and facing various slings and arrows, together and apart. A major theme of the novel is the push-pull between money and art, a salient topic in a time when artists face personal and financial peril under an unsmiling government.\nThe book was a critical and commercial success, and made the New York Times’ list of the 100 most notable books of the 21st century. Among its fans are author John Green, who has been vocal about his take of Trump as a national disaster. Green called the novel “one of the best books I’ve ever read.” Bill Gates, who donated some $50 million to organizations supporting Kamala Harris before Election Day and has since publicly sounded the alarm on the current administration’s cuts to public health, loved it too. He said that the book “resonated with me for personal reasons,” but also that the story is “a terrific metaphor for human connection.” DNC speaker Oprah Winfrey included the book in her list of the best books of 2022.\nMore recently, Zevin was at the center of a controversy when a Chicago bookstore removed the novel from consideration for the store's book club, calling Zevin “a Zionist” in an email and explaining that they didn't want to give her “monetary support.” She has never publicly spoken about her views on Israel, and was also included on a separate list of reportedly Zionist authors for readers to consider boycotting. The bookstore publicly apologized for removing her book from the poll without discussion, and to their Jewish customers, but not to Zevin herself.\nIvanka Trump is also Jewish, having converted before marrying Kushner.\nHannah’s The Women, a historical fiction account of a young woman working as a military nurse during the Vietnam War, was also an instant No. 1 NYT bestseller. It explores themes of mental health and trauma—not things Trump is a huge believer in, beside his many gaffes around military veterans. (Remember when he said that recipients of the Congressional Medal of Honor are in “bad shape” or “dead”? Or his assertion that those who seek help for mental health or suffer from PTSD aren't “strong”? How about his former chief of staff saying Trump referred to fallen vets as “suckers” and “losers”? He disputed that last one, but there are more where that came from.) Gates called Hannah’s book a “beautifully written tribute to a group of veterans who deserve more appreciation for the incredible sacrifices they made.” Nicholas Kristof, the adamantly anti-Trump Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times journalist, dubbed the book “historical fiction at its very best.”\nAnd then there’s recent release The Tell, a memoir from Griffin. It’s also a bestseller and got the full Oprah’s Book Club treatment, sticker on the cover and all. In the book, Griffin details how she uncovered childhood and sexual trauma with the help of psychedelic drugs. Chanel Miller, author of Know My Name, her own account of the trauma of being sexually assaulted by Brock Turner, praised the book as “transformative and illuminating.” Miller invoked Trump, accused several times over of sexual assault, which he denied, in her own memoir, writing, “We live in a time where it has become difficult to distinguish between the President's words and that of a 19-year-old assailant. Society gives women the near impossible task of separating harmlessness from danger, the foresight of knowing what some men are capable of.”\nSo, Ivanka, tell us, your imaginary book club: What did you take from these books that your dad would almost certainly abhor?","summary":"In a post-spring break photo dump that included snaps of the first daughter jumping in exaltation, she revealed the three New York Times bestsellers she read “until the sun dipped low.”","url":"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/story/ivanka-trump-vacation-beach-reads-anti-trump","image":"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/68095eceebc0625b0eed8194/16:9/w_3344,h_1881,c_limit/1230426409","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-23 21:56:08","author":"Kase Wickman","authors":["Kase Wickman"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.254},{"id":314141108,"title":"Democrat NH Senator Backs Rep’s Bid for Elevation to Retiring Lawmaker’s Senate Seat","text":"Rep.

Maggie Hassan, his fellow New Hampshire Democrat. \n\nPappas is running for the nomination to be the Democrat candidate in the November 2026 election to replace Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H. Shaheen in March announced her intent to retire at the end of her current term. \n\nHassan is a prominent figure in the Granite State, having previously served as governor from 2013 to 2017. She has represented New Hampshire in the Senate since then. Pappas has also been endorsed by another Maggie: Rep. Maggie Goodlander, D-N.Y.\n\nRepublicans are facing an uphill battle for the seat, in a light-blue state that went for then-Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election by nearly 3 points. Popular former New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu opted against a run, and former Sen. Scott Brown, R-Mass., is still mulling jumping into the race. Brown unsuccessfully attempted to unseat Shaheen in 2014 after moving to New Hampshire. \n\nPappas is a rising star in the state Democratic Party, having been elected to represent New Hampshire in the House of Representatives in 2018.

She's even more popular now among New York Republicans than she was six years ago.Why It MattersOcasio-Cortez is one of the Democratic Party's most influential lawmakers. She's been viewed by members of both major parties as both a lightning rod and an advocate for change, in a similar vein to Trump himself.She and progressive firebrand Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders have traveled the country in recent weeks as part of their \"Fighting Oligarchy\" tour, which has attracted huge crowds in both red and blue states—including over 30,000 attendees in a Trump-won California district and over 12,000 in Idaho.What To KnowOcasio-Cortez, who has served New York's 14th congressional district since 2019, is drawing more appeal from members of the political opposition, according to new polling.A survey of 802 New York State voters conducted by the Siena College Research Institute between April 14-16 shows that 21 percent of statewide Republicans view her in a \"favorable\" light. About 60 percent of Republicans said the opposite, while 19 percent weren't sure or offered no opinion on her.It's a dramatic shift from when she was first elected. A Siena survey of 700 statewide voters in March 2019 showed that just 6 percent of New York Republicans viewed her favorably, while 51 percent viewed her unfavorably.The same poll from six years ago asked if Ocasio-Cortez was a \"hero\" or \"villain,\" to which just 2 percent of Republicans at the time viewed her as a \"hero.\" The question was not asked in the most recent survey.About 64 percent Democrats viewed her in a favorable manner in the most recent poll, up from 47 percent in March 2019.Ocasio-Cortez is also more popular statewide in the most recent Siena survey than her Democratic counterpart, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. Schumer's 39 percent favorable and 49 percent unfavorable ratings pale in comparison to Ocasio-Cortez's 47 percent favorable and 33 percent unfavorable ratings.The fourth-term congresswoman is the most well-liked New York elected official of anyone per the poll, topping Democratic Governor Kathy Hochul, Democratic Representative Richie Torres, Republican Representative Mike Lawler, and Trump.What People Are SayingRepresentative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez at a recent rally in Los Angeles: \"I heard that someone was flying a plane with a banner that said this is Trump country... It sure don't look like it today. I don't think this is Trump country. This is our country.\"Former 538 staffer Galen Druke: \"I think there's a lot of points in her favor at this very moment. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has broad appeal across the Democratic Party.\"What Happens NextWhile speculation has surrounded former Senator and Vice President Kamala Harris as it pertains to the Democratic nominees in 2028, a new poll from Data for Progress found that her popularity may be dwindling in favor of other candidates, including Ocasio-Cortez, former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, and Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey.","summary":"AOC tops favorability among New Yorkers, beating both President Trump and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/aoc-republicans-new-york-polls-2063262","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2632013/aoc.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-23 21:18:55","author":"Nick Mordowanec","authors":["Nick Mordowanec"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.048},{"id":314131606,"title":"CNN’s Jake Tapper rips Paramount owner Shari Redstone as CBS fights high-stakes legal battle with Trump","text":"CNN anchor Jake Tapper on Tuesday accused Shari Redstone, the controlling shareholder of CBS News parent company Paramount, of sacrificing the integrity of the outlet by likely settling a lawsuit President Donald Trump filed against the network.\n\nTapper suggested such a settlement may occur in order for Redstone to protect a possible highly profitable merger with another media giant. \n\n“Now, Shari Redstone is the majority owner of Paramount, and she stands to make a fortune if this multibillion-dollar deal, if this merger goes through,” the CNN host said, referring to a possible merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media. \n\nTrump is seeking $20 billion in a lawsuit against CBS, alleging election interference over its handling of a “60 Minutes” interview last year with then-Vice President Kamala Harris. \n\nThe president accused the network of aiding his 2024 Democratic opponent through deceptive editing just weeks before the presidential election. \n\nCBS’ parent company, Paramount Global, agreed to mediation, signaling their courtroom feud will result in a settlement. \n\n“It seems as if Shari Redstone is likely to bend the knee to Trump and settle this allegedly frivolous lawsuit,” Tapper continued.\n\n“‘It’s clear now, in a quest to sell the company, Shari Redstone and others will bow to presidential pressure,'” Tapper said, quoting from a “60 Minutes” source who spoke to CNN. \n\n“’60 Minutes’ is one of the crown jewels of American broadcast journalism, and they have no problem crushing it in their race to make a deal and make themselves richer,'” Tapper said, continuing to quote from the source.\n\n“This war against the fourth estate journalists is of this piece,” Tapper said.\n\nSpeaking of “60 Minutes” executive producer Bill Owens, who announced this week that he was quitting the flagship program, Tapper continued, “Owens is not without his critics, of course, but this is not about one man or even about one show.

Yet, despite the scale of the coverup, the biggest fiasco of the Biden presidency was not his poor health and mental state. It was how his administration fully leaned into the “great awokening” despite his campaign message of returning to normalcy.\n\nA report from The New York Times on Tuesday highlighted how Biden ultimately ceded ground to his left flank on issues such as forcing schools to allow men in women’s sports with little opposition despite his trepidation. The former president, who ran as some kind of moderate, barely performed the function of a speed bump to the Left’s desires.\n\nIt’s that legacy Democrats and their media enablers will try to make you forget.\n\nWith a chief executive essentially out on a four-year lid, the Left’s political machine worked on autopilot.\n\nThey flooded the country with illegal aliens, completely circumventing the laws of our nation and creating a ginormous mess for the succeeding regime to deal with. They pushed DEI into the government. They forced transgender insanity onto K-12 campuses and Easter was used to celebrate a “Trans Day of Visibility.” \n\nThey stumbled and bumbled aimlessly in foreign policy with no more of a strategy than to keep up the narrative that they were fighting for “democracy” against authoritarians while using government tools to silence their domestic opponents.\n\nAll this while the president snoozed at the beach.\n\nAs a result, Democrats were ultimately swept out of office and fell to their lowest popularity in the history of polling.\n\nHowever, despite being obviously so far gone, Biden lingers like old cigarette smoke clinging to a jacket. He emerged from the woodwork recently to make a bizarre and stuttering speech that simply reminded everyone about the chasm in energy levels between him and President Donald Trump.\n\nThe Left just can’t make this problem go away, even if they want to. Some Democrats are trying to use Biden’s ill health to make excuses for their party’s failures while giving themselves the out that they had no idea Biden was in such bad shape.\n\nA clip that made the rounds this weekend of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., hemming and hawing on a podcast is very much worth watching. She very poorly tried to tell viewers that she was convinced that Biden was just fine until the moment before he dropped out of the election.\n\nThis is a setup for the classic George Costanza defense of something not being a lie as long as you believe it.\n\n“Do you regret saying that President Biden had a mental acuity, he had a sharpness to him?” podcast host Sam Fragoso asked Warren on Sunday. Fragoso noted that the Massachusetts senator maintained that line right up to the moment Biden dropped out of the race in July.\n\n“I said what I believe to be true,” Warren responded. “I said I had not seen decline and I hadn’t at that point.”\n\nFragoso looked incredulous and didn’t let the issue go. He asked Warren if Biden was as sharp as herself to which she visibly held back laughter and knew that she was caught in the trap.\n\nAs Warren began listing off such impressive Biden feats such as being “on his feet” and attending meetings, Fragoso interrupted.\n\n“‘On his feet’ is not praise,” Fragoso told Warren. “‘He can speak in sentences’ is not praise.”\n\nWarren responded, “fair enough.”\n\nThis dynamic between the press and Democrats is interesting and perhaps not all that it seems.\n\nWhereas up until the moment of Biden’s catastrophic presidential debate most legacy and leftwing media were still programmed to say that questions about Biden’s health were right wing conspiracies, they are now actually prodding Democrat politicians if the subject comes up at all.\n\nDon’t think for a moment this is because of some sudden commitment to journalistic integrity or anything like that. When it became clear that Biden was no longer useful and that he had become an outright impediment to the Left’s power they turned on him.\n\nWhat’s happening is that the media is going into a phony “mea culpa” mode to in part help Democrats pin their troubles entirely on Biden’s health and lack of energy rather than the Left’s policies and ideology.\n\nThe reason Biden’s successor as candidate, former Vice President Kamala Harris, was torched by Trump in the 2024 election and that nearly every demographic shifted to the right was not just because Biden was a do-nothing president (though that certainly didn’t help).\n\nThe issue was that Democrat ideas, their policies, and the cultural values they were foisting on the country were absolutely loathed. They embraced issues like defunding the police and forcing women’s sports leagues to admit biological men. On issue after issue, Democrats supported positions that were massively unpopular with Americans, though massively popular with elite institutions.\n\nOnce the legacy media narrative machine really cracked there was a bottoming out for a Democratic Party that for too long had coasted on their institutional advantages.\n\nNow Democrats are locked into continuing support for those deeply unpopular issues despite some of the craftier members of the party trying to shift the rhetoric if not the policies.\n\nThey are banking on Americans having memory loss, just like Biden, and convincing everyone that the previous president’s failures were an anomaly, that the country hadn’t fallen into a deep malaise that they caused, and that Trump is disrupting a political system that was working smoothly and efficiently with just a bit of trouble at the top.\n\nThe media’s gaslighting and Democrat denials about Biden’s health were not the only problem, they were symptoms of a larger issue of America’s elite institutional corruption. Now that the corruption has been exposed to the American people, they are desperately trying to rewrite history.","summary":"The infirmity of&#160;President Joe Biden&#160;during his time in office is one of the biggest scandals in American political history.

To make independent decisions based on what was right for 60 Minutes, right for the audience.”\n\nTrump objected to a “60 Minutes” interview earlier this month with Volodymyr Zelensky in the Ukrainian president’s home town of Kryvyi Rih, and has pressed his Federal Communications Commission to investigate the network.\n\nIn October 2024, then-candidate Trump sued the network over another “60 Minutes” interview with his Democratic presidential opponent in that year’s elections, former Vice President Kamala Harris. He is seeking $20 billion in damages. (Yes, billion with a “b”.) The case is now in mediation.\n\nTrump had accused the news program of “fraud,” airing “defamatory” segments, “illegally” intervening in the last presidential election, “corruptly changing major answers to Interview questions” and being a “Political Operative” that has engaged in “unlawful and illegal behavior.”\n\nHe added that CBS should lose its broadcast license and “pay a big price.”\n\nComplicating matters, CBS’ parent company, Paramount Global, is simultaneously trying to complete an $8.4 billion merger with Skydance Media, which requires the administration’s approval under the FCC.\n\nUS media and free-speech watchdog have cried foul, lambasting Paramount chairwoman Shari Redstone for caving to political pressure, sacrificing journalistic principles in order to get a merger deal done and avoid litigation.\n\nCNN anchor Jake Tapper said on Thursday, it seems as if “Shari Redstone is likely to bend the knee to Trump and settle this allegedly frivolous lawsuit.”\n\n“Hope the money’s worth it, Shari,” he quipped.\n\nIn March of last year, Trump filed a defamation lawsuit against ABC News and its anchor George Stephanopoulos (a former White House communications director under Bill Clinton) for an undisclosed sum, arguing that, in an on-air interview, Stephanopoulos harmed Trump’s reputation by claiming he was found liable for “raping” the writer E. Jean Carroll. His team’s legal argument was Trump’s forced digital penetration of Carroll was “sexual assault” and not “rape”.\n\nABC News settled out of court for a $15 million contribution to Trump’s presidential library, $1 million to cover his legal fees, and a public apology from Stephanopoulos.\n\n“Trump’s hostility to freedom of the press is also apparent in his frivolous defamation lawsuits, his threats of regulatory retaliation against broadcasters, and his ridiculous dispute with the Associated Press, which he sought to exclude from the White House because it did not fully embrace his new name for the body of water between the United States and Mexico,” Reason magazine wrote on Thursday.\n\n“‘If the Government opens its doors to some journalists,’ a federal judge ruled in that last case, ‘it cannot then shut those doors to other journalists because of their viewpoints.’”","summary":"Free-speech advocates in the US are irate about news organizations caving to Trump’s threats and lawsuits.

The penalties include revoking lawyers' security clearances, restricting their access to federal buildings and officials, canceling federal contracts with the targeted firms, and scrutinizing other contractors for ties to them. Today two of those firms, WilmerHale and Perkins Coie, asked federal judges in the District of Columbia to issue permanent injunctions against the orders affecting them, which they say blatantly violate the First Amendment and other constitutional guarantees.\n\nPaul, Weiss, which Trump targeted in a March 14 executive order, already has bent to Trump's will. A week later, it agreed to a set of humiliating conditions in exchange for revocation of the order, which threatened to cripple its business. At least eight other law firms have followed that example, preemptively capitulating to avoid orders aimed at them. But a few firms, including WilmerHale and Perkins Coie, chose to stand their ground, and they seem likely to succeed in court.\n\nTrump targeted WilmerHale in an executive order issued on March 27. The very next day, U.S. District Judge Richard J. Leon granted WilmerHale a temporary restraining order (TRO), noting that the First Amendment prohibits government retaliation for constitutionally protected speech, including \"retaliatory actions based on perceived viewpoint.\" He added that \"the retaliatory nature of the Executive Order at issue here is clear on its face,\" and \"there is no doubt this retaliatory action chills speech and legal advocacy, or that it qualifies as a constitutional harm.\"\n\nLeon was skeptical of WilmerHale's challenge to Trump's revocation of security clearances, noting that the D.C. Circuit \"has held that security clearance decisions are within the purview of the Executive Branch\" and that the law firm had not \"pointed to persuasive authority that would support extraordinary injunctive relief at this stage.\" But he said WilmerHale was likely to succeed in its challenge to other aspects of Trump's order against the firm, including its limits on access and contracting.\n\nIn the Perkins Coie case, U.S. District Judge Beryl A. Howell likewise swiftly issued a TRO, acting less than a week after Trump's March 6 order aimed at that firm and a day after Perkins Coie filed its motion. During a hearing on March 12, Howell concluded that Trump's order likely violated \"at least\" three constitutional provisions.\n\nHowell said the order probably violated the First Amendment because it \"unlawfully retaliates against [Perkins Coie] for protected speech\" and \"constitutes unlawful viewpoint discrimination.\" The order also implicated the Fifth Amendment's guarantee of due process, she said, because it was likely \"void for vagueness\" and because Perkins Coie \"was not even given the most basic protection of advance notice\" or a chance to be heard.\n\nHowell added that Trump's order impinged on the Sixth Amendment right to counsel because it interfered with the freedom of clients to choose the representation they prefer. She worried that the president's edict \"threatens to significantly undermine the integrity of our entire legal system and the ability of all people and groups to access justice.\"\n\nTo understand why Leon and Howell had little difficulty reaching these conclusions, and in particular why they immediately recognized a threat to the First Amendment, you need only look at the president's explicitly stated rationales for the orders. He made it clear that he was singling out these firms because he perceived them as supporters of his political foes and opponents of his preferred policies.\n\nWilmerHale's sins included \"engag[ing] in obvious partisan representations to achieve political ends,\" Trump said, alluding to the firm's work for the Democratic National Committee, state-level Democratic organizations, and the presidential campaigns of two Democrats: Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Trump complained that WilmerHale was \"bent on employing lawyers who weaponize the prosecutorial power to upend the democratic process and distort justice,\" mentioning former Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who investigated Trump, and two of \"his colleagues.\"\n\nExplaining Trump's February 25 sanctions against Covington Burling, the White House cited a similar grievance: the firm's legal advice to former Special Counsel Jack Smith. That association, it said, showed that the firm's lawyers were unworthy of security clearances, because \"Jack Smith and his staff spent more than $50 million in taxpayer dollars to target President Trump—an egregious misuse of judicial authority for political ends and part of the prior administration's unprecedented weaponization of prosecutorial power to upend the democratic process.\"\n\nTrump averred that WilmerHale had engaged in \"egregious conduct\" by \"support[ing] efforts to discriminate on the basis of race,\" referring to the firm's defense of Harvard University's affirmative action practices against a successful challenge by Students for Fair Admissions. He also accused WilmerHale of supporting \"the obstruction of efforts to prevent illegal aliens from committing horrific crimes and trafficking deadly drugs within our borders,\" by which he meant that the firm had challenged some of his immigration policies during his first term. He added that WilmerHale \"furthers the degradation of the quality of American elections, including by supporting efforts designed to enable noncitizens to vote.\" That was a reference to the firm's involvement in challenges to state voter identification and registration laws.\n\nSuch legal work, Trump claimed, is \"detrimental to critical American interests.\" It \"threaten[s] public safety and national security, limit[s] constitutional freedoms, degrade[s] the quality of American elections, or undermine[s] bedrock American principles.\" Firms like WilmerHale \"regularly conduct this harmful activity through their powerful pro bono practices, earmarking hundreds of millions of their clients' dollars for destructive causes,\" he said, adding that lawyers who \"engage in such egregious conduct should not have access to our Nation's secrets\" or \"be subsidized by Federal taxpayer funds or contracts.\"\n\nTrump's bill of particulars against Perkins Coie was similar. He said it was guilty of \"representing failed Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\" and \"work[ing] with activist donors including George Soros to judicially overturn popular, necessary, and democratically enacted election laws, including those requiring voter identification.\" He criticized the firm's \"diversity, equity, and inclusion\" (DEI) policies, which he said included fellowships reserved for applicants from specific racial groups. He complained that Perkins Coie \"has filed lawsuits against the Trump Administration, including one designed to reduce military readiness.\"\n\nBy his own account, then, Trump retaliated against WilmerHale and Perkins Coie for their legal work—specifically, for representing Democratic candidates, Democratic organizations, and clients who challenged policies that the president favors. It is not hard to see why Leon deemed \"the retaliatory nature\" of Trump's WilmerHale order \"clear on its face,\" or why Howell thought it was likely that the Perkins Coie order \"constitutes unlawful viewpoint discrimination.\"\n\nThe WilmerHale order, the firm argues, \"is a textbook example of retaliation for constitutionally protected expression.\" It notes that \"WilmerHale's advocacy on behalf of its clients is unquestionably protected by the First Amendment,\" that the threatened damage to the firm's business was apt to have a chilling effect on that advocacy, and that \"it is unmistakable from the face of the Order that the President's 'retaliatory motive'\" was \"a 'but-for' cause\" of the injuries it would inflict.\n\nWilmerHale adds that Trump's order \"openly discriminates against disfavored speakers and viewpoints,\" which is presumptively unconstitutional. \"While most litigation requires discovery to unearth retaliatory motive,\" it says, \"the President openly proclaims that he is targeting WilmerHale for representing his political opponents in election-related litigation, challenging his immigration-enforcement policies, associating with his perceived enemies (including a Special Counsel appointed by the President's own Justice Department), and defending a client's race-conscious college admission policies.\"\n\nIn addition to freedom of speech, WilmerHale argues, the order interferes with the First Amendment right to \"petition the Government for a redress of grievances\" and \"abridges the freedom of association.\" The firm also argues that the order exceeds the president's legal authority, violates WilmerHale's rights to due process and equal protection, and violates its clients' \"rights to engage counsel of their choice.\" Perkins Coie offers similar arguments in support of its motion for a permanent injunction.\n\n\"Simply put,\" WilmerHale says, \"blacklisting and sanctioning law firms for representing the president's political opponents, devoting resources to causes the president dislikes or hiring attorneys who have investigated the president is anathema to our constitutional order.\" But if these cases are the slam dunks they seem to be, you might wonder, why did Paul Weiss and the other firms cave rather than fight?\n\nIn exchange for presidential mercy, Trump bragged on March 21, Paul Weiss agreed to adopt \"a policy of political neutrality with respect to client selection and attorney hiring\"; take on \"a wide range of pro bono matters representing the full political spectrum\"; commit to \"merit-based hiring, promotion, and retention, instead of 'diversity, equity, and inclusion' policies\"; and dedicate \"the equivalent of $40 million in pro bono legal services\" during the next few years \"to support causes including assisting our Nation's veterans, fairness in the justice system, and combating anti-Semitism.\"\n\nAlthough Trump cited the firm's \"remarkable change of course,\" WilmerHale notes, he did not explain \"why the 'national security' concerns\" he had \"referenced in issuing the March 14 Order\" had somehow \"dissipated just one week later.\" To avoid the president's wrath, other firms agreed to similar conditions. Skadden, Arps, for example, promised to abandon DEI policies; represent clients without regard to \"the personal political views of individual lawyers\"; ensure that its pro bono activities \"represent the full political spectrum\"; and devote \"at least $100 Million\" in pro bono legal services to \"causes that the President and Skadden both support.\"\n\nThese \"extraordinary capitulations,\" WilmerHale notes, demonstrate the potency of the president's threats. \"These large and successful firms,\" it says, \"viewed the threat of similar sanctions as sufficiently dire to agree to a series of demands, including their commitments to devote a collective $340 million in pro bono resources 'to causes that the President…support[s],' to avoid these same consequences. These actions well illustrate that, given the realities of the legal market, entities of 'ordinary firmness' not only could be, but in fact have been deterred\" by Trump's \"blacklisting and sanctions.\"\n\nThat brief was filed on April 8. As of April 16, The New York Times reported, the pro bono services extorted by Trump from nine law firms totaled \"nearly $1 billion,\" and Trump has \"hinted\" that he views those promised services as \"a legal war chest to be used as he wishes.\" Citing \"two people briefed on the matter,\" the Times said the options include \"sending the lawyers to help Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency,\" \"deploying them to aid the Justice Department,\" or even assigning them to represent \"Mr. Trump or his allies if they became ensnared in investigations.\"\n\nAlthough major law firms initially were reluctant to criticize Trump's orders, The New York Times notes, \"some in the legal world have rallied behind\" WilmerHale and Perkins Coie after seeing that the courts \"appeared at least initially receptive\" to their claims. More than 500 law firms joined a brief in the Perkins Coie case that was filed on April 2. Perkins Coie's case also attracted support from hundreds of law professors and an ideologically diverse bunch of civil liberties groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the Cato Institute, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the Institute for Justice, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, and the Rutherford Institute.\n\n\"President Trump has singled out one of the nation's largest law firms for serious, potentially business-ending sanctions by executive fiat, citing the firm's past representation of his political opponents and its 'partisan lawsuits against the United States,'\" the latter brief says. \"The President's action violates fundamental First Amendment freedoms and other constitutional protections. More generally, it is an attack on the independence of the legal profession.\"\n\nThe ACLU et al. offer a warning for Republicans who might shrug at that attack because they do not view the targets as sympathetic. \"The fallout from these assaults on the bar may not be limited to lawyers who represent clients or causes that are perceived as hostile to President Trump,\" they note. \"The precedent created here could be used by future presidents, of either party, to chill advocacy hostile to their policies or executive branch officials. If allowed to stand, these pressure tactics will have broad and lasting impacts on Americans' ability to retain legal counsel in important matters, to arrange their business and personal affairs as they like, and to speak their minds.\"","summary":"Two of his targets are seeking permanent injunctions against the president's blatantly unconstitutional executive orders.","url":"https://reason.com/2025/04/23/by-openly-retaliating-against-disfavored-law-firms-trump-attacks-free-speech-and-the-right-to-counsel/","image":"https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/04/Donald-Trump-4-23-25-Newscom-scaled-e1745436851434.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-23 20:40:45","author":"Jacob Sullum","authors":["Jacob Sullum"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.325},{"id":314129084,"title":"Protester Speaks Out After Trump Tower Demonstration Ends in Arrest","text":"A protester has been arrested at Trump Tower in New York City after spray painting over the presidential seal.The climate change activist, who has not been named, told Newsweek, \"I did this because I am an American.

They recognized the need to stand together and had the courage to rebel rather than watch their freedom perish. It was a call to resist a government marked by chaos and cruelty, and to begin building alternative structures capable of repairing the damage being done to the country.\"The protester said, in a statement sent to Newsweek, \"All American political parties are equally complicit in inaction which has brought us to this point.

It launches on May 5, taking the slot previously held by Joy Reid, who has since departed the network and set up a Substack. The show will air for two hours on Monday and one hour from Tuesday through Friday. The expansion of the Weekend franchise, which was launched with the trio in January 2024, comes as newly appointed MSNBC president Rebecca Kutler begins to put her mark on the network’s programming lineup.\nAnd the three are ready to take on the challenge of anchoring a show on weeknights, which will see them react to the flood of news that’s come out of the White House, and elsewhere, throughout the day. Sanders Townsend points out that they all have gotten some experience in the 7 p.m. slot since Reid’s exit. “We’ve all been hosting it and have gotten in kind of that muscle memory.”\n“We’re 16 months in, and Michael still likes to be like, ‘Well, I’m new here,’” quips Menendez when asked about their dynamic as a trio. “Look, I’m just a brother trying to figure it all out. I don’t want to step on anybody’s toes,” Steele, who has been a regular contributor to the network for more than a decade, says. Sanders Townsend, who previously served as the chief spokesperson for Vice President Kamala Harris, adds, “It’s like we’re inviting you into our cool-kids table to talk about it all.”\nAll three of the hosts have been either directly involved in politics at a granular level or around it to some degree. Steele previously served as the lieutenant governor of Maryland and the chairman of the Republican National Committee; Sanders Townsend was a Democratic operative and adviser; and Menendez, who has been covering politics for years, is also the daughter of disgraced former senator Bob Menendez. When asked how they respond to complaints about a government-to-media pipeline, Sanders Townsend says, “We aren’t the first, to be very clear, and we won’t be the last.”\n“And now apparently there’s a journalist-to-government pipeline. Hello, Secretary Pete Hegseth,” Sanders Townsend also points out, referencing the Fox News weekend anchor turned top Pentagon official. She adds that the hosts’ experience being “literally in the room” and around politics “helps us, frankly, connect with not just the viewers better, but our guests.”\n“If you’ve written talking points, if you’ve been on the talking points, then you know how to knock people off the talking points,” Menendez says.\nThis conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\nVanity Fair: The launch of the new show is coming at a particularly volatile political moment, a second Trump term with ongoing legal drama and consistent institutional battles. How are you looking at approaching this news cycle?\nMichael Steele: Volatile? Alicia, you think it’s volatile right now? It’s crazy. From my perspective, that’s what makes the conversation more exciting, to be able to find fresh angles about it. As a former elected official who ran a political party and really has an appreciation of how these dynamics are playing out negatively for the country, and how do we talk about that, what I love about what the three of us do is that we actually want to talk about it. We don’t want to get into the sort of performative kind of conversation where you’re not really pulling back layers of it like an onion. Each layer you pull back, you still cry. That’s what we try to do. We try to help people understand what’s happening right now and give it context historically, politically, socially, culturally, and with some humor and seriousness and all that’s required to have a good conversation.\nAlicia Menendez: The mission of MSNBC remains the same, regardless of who’s in office​​—lead with the facts, share context. So we are covering this administration without fear, without favor, and with a lot of coffee.\nSymone Sanders Townsend: We really think about adding context to what is happening. When you do a show on the weekend and you’re watching everything that’s happening all week, you have to pick and choose. You get time to say, Okay, we’ve seen it all. We’ve digested it all. This is what we think, and this is maybe a thread that nobody else pulled on. The difference between the weeknight is we are now going to be reacting in real time. We’ve had, obviously, lots of practice doing that over the years, but over the last couple of months, specifically, every single week, each one of us has been hosting the 7 p.m. hour. We’ve all been hosting it and have gotten in kind of that muscle memory, also bringing that same energy that we have on the weekend to our show because we are a conversation. It’s like we’re inviting you into our cool-kids table to talk about it all.\nYou have all worked together now for over a year. Are there any specific roles that you have fallen into naturally?\nMenendez: We’re 16 months in, and Michael still likes to be like, “Well, I’m new here.”\nSanders Townsend: Michael’s still like, “Oh, you ladies know it. I’m just here.”\nSteele: Look, I’m just a brother trying to figure it all out. I don’t want to step on anybody’s toes. I don’t want to make anybody mad.\nMenendez: You’ve learned which camera is your camera, Michael.\nSanders Townsend: Any given day, we each play a different role, I would argue. We did a panel discussion with Reverend [Al] Sharpton the other day, and we were toward the end, and Alicia was so funny. She said, “Since I’m the one whose job it is to usually get us to commercial break…” And we all cracked up because it’s true. Sometimes I done wrapped Michael up and he’s said what he’s said. Maybe I’m turnt up and I said what I said, and Alicia is like, “Thank you, and we will be right back.” And then we go on the other side and sometimes Alicia is very fired up about something, and it’s like, Clock it, Alicia, clock it. Let them know.\nI love the three-person dynamic. For Alicia and I, we used to host our own shows. It’s different when you have your own show. It’s about you, what you think, the stories that you like, your context. When you have a show with one or two other people, it is a group conversation. I didn’t think I would love it. The PR people were like, Should we say this? But I really feel this way. I didn’t know if I would love a group situation. I literally love the group situation. On the days that Michael or Alicia aren’t there, I’m like, Where are my people? I wonder what Alicia would say about this. Or, I think if Mr. Chairman was here, he would say X, Y, and Z. That rapport is real.\nSteele: For me, this is all new, you know. [Eye rolls from Menendez and Sanders Townsend]\nMenendez: He’s going to be at his retirement party—\nSanders Townsend: He’s going to be like, “I’m still new here.”\nSteele: I’m not a journalist. Symone is a comms person extraordinaire, and I have mad respect for Alicia’s skills at journalism. I can be a silly billy. And these two are like, Let’s reframe and reset and focus. That, for me, is a little bit of a learning curve, because, remember, I’m the guy who was always being asked the questions for the last 13 years of my time at MSNBC. In my 14th year, I’m the one asking those questions of others, and so that transition has been fun.\nTo Alicia’s point about the extemporaneous nature of it, that side of it is very fluid. It’s very real. But we’re mindful that we also need to get the important stuff in front of the audience​​—the background, the history, the storyline that they shouldn’t miss because of the politics or because of the craziness that’s coming out of the administration today, which can be the drama that’s distracting, as opposed to the underlying core thread that they’re stripping away your fundamental rights.\nSanders Townsend: I do think that the people are the best barometer on this. We’re going to ask the questions to the news makers and the people that are at our table to see what they think and try to tease this conversation out, but also, like, let’s take it a step further. People understand that—they appreciate that clarity and they appreciate the directness. They appreciate that Michael isn’t trying to contort himself into a box of what someone who hosts the show should be like. They want Michael Steele. People want Alicia Menendez. They want Symone Sanders Townsend, and that is what we are going to bring to 7 p.m. And frankly, that’s what Rebecca [Kutler] and [Senior Vice President Greg Kordick] want us to do. That’s why we have this opportunity.\nMichael and Symone, you worked in politics pretty extensively. I’m curious what your response would be to people who might be wary of the politics-to-media pipeline. How do you maintain journalistic integrity given your experiences?\nSanders Townsend: We aren’t the first, to be very clear and we won’t be the last. And now apparently there’s a journalist-to-government pipeline. Hello, Secretary Pete Hegseth.\nOur experience gives us insight. I’ve worked with reporters from every angle, [with] my colleagues now at MSNBC, previously when I was a commentator at CNN, but also throughout my life as a political operative. Sometimes when you haven’t done it, when you haven’t been in the room, when it’s not something that you’ve lived, there’s things that you don’t think to ask. And it’s not something anyone can tell you; it’s just that you’ve lived it. And the thing that Michael and I bring is that we have lived this. I think that experience that we bring, having been literally in the room, helps us, frankly, connect with not just the viewers better, but our guests.\nWe had the president of the Heritage Foundation on our show. We were the only show that got him on cable, Kevin Roberts, and that interview, I think, was a very important and illuminating interview that the three of us brought our various backgrounds to…to tease out the information that the viewers wanted to know. To get Kevin Roberts on the record of a number of things that the Heritage Foundation had said in prep, but no one had gotten them to stay on camera—those are the kind of interviews we want to do. We want to talk to the news makers. We want to talk to Republicans, because we want to understand what the hell is going on.\nMenendez: If you’ve written talking points, if you’ve been on the talking points, then you know how to knock people off the talking points.\nI’m wondering if any of you would be willing to speak to how and when discussions started about the move to weekdays. What kind of support has the network provided under the leadership of Rebecca Kutler during this transition?\nSanders Townsend: Look, we found out when everybody else found out. So just go ahead and clear that up right there. No secret pipelines around here.\nThat being said, I think it’s safe to say the network leadership has been extremely supportive of us. To be very clear, Rebecca made the decision to bring in all these different voices. We are expanding the weekend franchise. Jen [Psaki] is going to 9 p.m. The expansion of all these voices is wonderful, and it is responsive—not just to where, in my opinion, the moment is now, but where it is going. People want politics, but they want pop culture. They want to hear the news, but they also want someone to help them take it further, especially the MSNBC audience. They are a very engaged audience. The opportunity to move to prime, I mean, I was shocked and excited, but mostly shocked.\nDo you all have a group chat with each other?\nMenendez: Yes, several different group chats, and we’ve got side chats where Symone and I talk about outfits. Michael acts like he’s upset that he’s not in the conversation about the outfits.\nSanders Townsend: It’s like, you’re gonna have on a suit. Like, you’re gonna wear blue.\nMenendez: Let me guess it’s blue.\nSanders Townsend: Blue, or maybe purple. It’s the purple tie.\nWe have multiple group chats. I will just note the group chat that has the three of us and our EP, Michael Steele is the lead photo, and we did, like, AI face-app enhancement on him. So it’s like a very young, Montel Williams–looking version of Michael Steele as our group photo. Very strong eyebrows.","summary":"Cohosts Michael Steele, Symone Sanders Townsend, and Alicia Menendez talk to VF about bringing viewers to their “cool-kids table” at 7 pm, making the shift from weekends, and who gets shut out of the fashion group chat.","url":"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/msnbcs-the-weeknight-hosts-cover-trump-without-fear","image":"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/68066c8c3a208452fa692edc/16:9/w_2845,h_1600,c_limit/vf-0425-MSNBC-7pm.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-23 18:05:24","author":"Natalie Korach","authors":["Natalie Korach"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.028},{"id":314102716,"title":"Trump's actions show his commitment to First Amendment rights is fake news","text":"On the first day of his second term, President Donald Trump signed an executive order aimed at “restoring freedom of speech.” But judging from his administration’s policies and his actions as a private litigant, Trump’s commitment to that principle is highly selective at best.\n\nLast week, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that he was “taking a crucial step toward keeping the president’s promise to liberate American speech” by ending his department’s misbegotten crusade against online “disinformation.” This was a welcome development, since that amorphous mission had become an excuse for suppressing constitutionally protected speech.\n\nStill, Rubio’s ringing defense of First Amendment rights is hard to reconcile with his determination to expel foreign students, including legal permanent residents, whose opinions he unilaterally deems contrary to U.S. foreign policy interests. Although Rubio and Trump seem to think the First Amendment applies only to American citizens, the U.S. Supreme Court disagrees.\n\nAnother Trump appointee, Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr, likewise pays lip service to free speech while working to undermine it. Carr, like Federal Trade Commission Chairman Andrew Ferguson, seems bent on overriding the editorial choices of social media companies in the name of fairness and balance — a form of meddling that the Supreme Court has recognized as a threat to First Amendment rights.\n\nCarr also aspires to police journalism, including the editing of a “60 Minutes” interview with Kamala Harris, which he thinks is a legitimate subject of regulatory review. Trump himself argues that CBS News committed consumer fraud under Texas law by making Harris seem less “CRAZY” and “DUMB,” which he risibly claims caused him “at least” $10 billion in damages.\n\nTrump is pursuing a similar lawsuit against The Des Moines Register and pollster Ann Selzer. He claims they violated the Iowa Consumer Fraud Act by reporting the results of a pre-election poll that erroneously gave Harris a three-point lead in that state.\n\nIt is hard to overstate the threat that carving out a “fake news” exception to the First Amendment would pose to freedom of the press. If Trump had his way, journalists would be exposed to daunting legal expenses and potentially ruinous civil liability whenever their reporting was arguably misleading or inaccurate.\n\nTrump’s hostility to freedom of the press is also apparent in his frivolous defamation lawsuits, his threats of regulatory retaliation against broadcasters, and his ridiculous dispute with the Associated Press, which he sought to exclude from the White House because it did not fully embrace his new name for the body of water between the United States and Mexico. “If the Government opens its doors to some journalists,” a federal judge ruled in that last case, “it cannot then shut those doors to other journalists because of their viewpoints.”\n\nTrump likewise engaged in viewpoint discrimination, which is presumptively unconstitutional, when he issued executive orders targeting law firms that have represented clients or causes he does not like. Lawyers at those firms, he decreed, would lose their security clearances, government contracts, and access to federal buildings.\n\nTrump also has targeted leading American universities, which he portrays as hotbeds of antisemitism and ideological indoctrination. While conservatives may be sympathetic to that critique, schools like Harvard plausibly argue that Trump’s attempts to impose his preferred reforms by threatening to withhold federal funding amount to “unconstitutional conditions,” requiring the surrender of First Amendment rights in exchange for a government benefit.\n\nTrump’s attack on diversity, equity, and inclusion programs also extends into the private sector. He has threatened businesses with “civil compliance investigations” aimed at rooting out “DEI discrimination,” a nebulous concept that is apt to have a chilling impact on employee training that promotes ideas the president considers “immoral.”\n\nRubio avers that Trump is determined to oppose “the weaponization of America’s own government to silence, censor, and suppress the free speech of ordinary Americans.” Yet that seems like an apt description of the president’s multifaceted crusade against speech that offends him.\n\nJacob Sullum is a senior editor at Reason magazine.\n\nSend letters to letters@suntimes.com\n\nGet Opinions content delivered to your inbox.

But she is not impressed with her fellow comedian and former talk show host Ellen DeGeneres’ decision to do the same.\n\nIn a new interview with Us Weekly Wednesday, O’Donnell said she was “surprised” to read that DeGeneres decamped to Great Britain with her wife Portia de Rossi after Trump won a second term. \n\n“I’ve never really known Ellen to say anything political in her life, so I was surprised to read that she left because of President Trump,” she told the magazine. “Like, that shocked me, actually.”\n\nWhile DeGeneres hasn’t publicly confirmed that she and de Rossi left the States on account of Trump’s win, sources “close” to her told The Wrap she wanted to “get the hell out” after the election results. DeGeneres publicly supported Kamala Harris on her social media accounts, but O’Donnell found her coyness about the move uninspiring. \n\nThe two former talk show hosts have an “awkward” history, which O’Donnell acknowledged Wednesday. “I don’t want to fight against another gay woman,” she said. “It’s not like we’re tenaciously opposed to each other. We’re just very different people. We have had some stuff in the past that we never resolved.” \n\nO’Donnell told The Hollywood Reporter in 2023 that what was once a “good relationship” between the two media personalities soured when DeGeneres publicly claimed they “weren’t friends” during a “downward media time for me.”\n\nO’Donnell’s Emmy-winning daytime talk series The Rosie O’Donnell Show aired from 1996 to 2002. During that time she earned the moniker “Queen of Nice” for her approachable on-air personality during that time. DeGeneres took up that torch with her “be kind to one another” mantra when her show premiered just one year later in 2003. \n\n“It became a strange, ‘There can’t be two lesbians in this town,’ kind of a thing,” O’Donnell explained in the THR interview. “Then we each had success and went our separate ways.” What’s more, she said, “She used the same staff from my show... So that was odd. It was very similar to my show.” \n\n“Then I asked to go on because of something I was promoting, and she said no. And I remember going, ‘Seriously?’ After she said no that one time, whenever they would ask me on the show, I would say no,” O’Donnell revealed, explaining why she never appeared as a guest. \n\nDeGeneres made one appearance as a guest on The Rosie O’Donnell Show in 1996.\n\nOf course, DeGeneres’ retooled “be kind” brand backfired in spectacular fashion when her show’s staff accused her of cultivating a toxic workplace. The scandal ushered in the end of Ellen in 2022.\n\nO’Donnell told Us, “We’re not really in each other’s worlds, and it’s been kind of awkward” between them. \n\nShe reflected on that awkwardness to THR, saying, “I don’t know if it’s jealousy, competition or the fact that she said a mean thing about me once that really hurt my feelings. But, “It would never occur to me to say ‘I don’t know her’ about somebody whose babies I held when they were born.”\n\n“I have a picture of her holding [my then-infant son] Parker,” O’Donnell continued then. “I know her mother. I could identify her brother without her in the room. I knew her for so many years. It just felt like I don’t trust this person to be in my world.”\n\nThough she told the site that DeGeneres apologized for the comment, it seems things haven’t changed much between them, as she blasted her ex-friend for leaving America for political reasons. \n\n“I’ve been a political person my whole life, not better or worse, it’s just a different way to be in the world,” she explained. “I was very clear about the reason why I was leaving, and I don’t think it came as a surprise to anyone.”\n\nDespite being an outspoken advocate for LGBTQ rights, DeGeneres has mostly avoided talking openly about her personal politics throughout her career, in sharp contrast to O’Donnell, who’s since become a prominent target of Trump‘s—so much so that she fled to Ireland following his second election win. \n\nShe told CNN Tuesday, “Not a day has gone by that I thought it was the wrong decision.” O’Donnell always been crystal clear about why she made that choice, which she doubled down on during her appearance: “I knew after reading Project 2025 that if Trump got in, it was time for me and my non-binary child to leave the country.”\n\nDeGeneres, on the other hand, dodged questions about her political alignments in 2019 when she was seen on camera laughing it up with George W. Bush at a Cowboys game—one of the only times she’d inadvertently made a political headline. “Just because I don’t agree with someone on everything doesn’t mean I’m not going to be friends with them,” she said at the time while (sort of) addressing the backlash to the clip on her show. \n\n“I wish her the best. I seriously do,” O’Donnell said Wednesday, since “gay comedians” need to “stick together.”","summary":"Alberto E.

According to co-host Akaash Singh, Flagrant, which has drawn controversy for its hosts’ willingness to engage with racist content, was unable to get Democrats to agree to come on the show, prompting Buttigieg to call them out for turning down the invitation. “We have to be encountering people who don’t think like us and who don’t view the world the way we do, both in order to become smarter and better and make better choices and take better positions, and also to persuade,” he said.\nCalling Buttigieg “the Democrats’ secret weapon,” Schultz and his co-hosts came away impressed by the end of the interview, particularly for being able to sit through the entire three hour block. “I think we’re all looking forward to seeing what you’re doing,” he said. “I think you’re a really brave and amazing figure in our political sphere.”\nThough he’s not the high-profile first elected Democrat to appear on a manosphere podcast — that honor goes to Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-VA), who appeared on The Joe Rogan Experience in August 2019 — Buttigieg has a long history of entering hostile media territory, making frequent appearances on Fox News as a surrogate for Joe Biden and even doing a televised town hall on the conservative television network. It’s not his first outing in the internet creator world, either: he appeared on Jubile’s YouTube series Surrounded during the 2024 election (“1 Politician vs. 25 Undecided Voters”). \nHe is, however, not the first Democrat to engage with the right-wing podcast world after Kamala Harris lost the 2024 presidential election, in part because she and her campaign did not engage with these influencers to the degree that Donald Trump did — a massive self-inflicted error that frequently comes up in election post-mortems. “All of his podcasts were reaching the audience that we were struggling to pull in… young men,” Harris campaign senior strategist Stephanie Cutter said during an appearance on Pod Save America, “and we saw that, we knew that.” The biggest self-own: Trump famously appeared on The Joe Rogan Experience just days before the election, reaching Rogan’s tens of millions of followers across Spotify and YouTube alone. Harris, however, snubbed their invite due to internal fears that the progressive staffers on the campaign would revolt. \nIn an attempt to avoid repeating that mistake, California Governor Gavin Newsom has invited MAGA figures such as Turning Point USA’s Charlie Kirk and War Room host Steve Bannon onto his podcast, which he launched in February as an attempt to “have honest discussions with people that agree AND disagree with us.”","summary":"A Democrat has entered the manosphere.

Henson on the challenges of being Black women living in the spotlight.\n\nThe author and activist even said she had to “basically trick” herself into following through on her desire to skip the inauguration — by ensuring that she wouldn’t have an appropriate outfit to wear if she started feeling the pressure to attend.\n\n“It started with not having anything to wear,” Obama said of the moment she finalized her decision. She explained that being first lady taught her to always have certain clothing at the ready if she suddenly had to attend a high-profile event, including a state funeral.\n\n“I was like, if I’m not going to do this thing, I got to tell my team, I don’t even want to have a dress ready, right?” she said. “Because it’s so easy to just say let me do the right thing.”\n\nShe said she knew she wouldn’t be able to change her mind if she didn’t have a dress ready to wear.\n\nObama has raised eyebrows in recent months over her decision to skip Trump’s inauguration, which was attended by other past first ladies, Hillary Clinton and Laura Bush, and their husbands. Michelle Obama also didn’t attend the funeral for President Jimmy Carter in January, where she would have been seated next to Trump and his wife Melania.\n\nHer absence from Trump’s inauguration immediately sparked rumors and “ridicule” that she and her husband were headed for divorce.\n\n“People couldn’t believe that I was saying no for any other reason, they had to assume that my marriage was falling apart,” she acknowledged on the podcast, which she co-hosts with her brother Craig Robinson.\n\nBut as she explained, not attending events with her husband, or attending events solo, are part of her effort, since leaving the White House in 2017, to embrace the “art of saying no” when it feels like the right decision.\n\n“It’s a muscle that you have to build,” Obama explained on the episode that dropped Wednesday. She said she had begun this “training late in life,” after spending the past 30 years in the public eye after her husband began his political career, culminating in his being elected president in 2008.\n\n“I am just now starting to build it,” she said of the “muscle.” After her family’s eight years in the White House, Obama said she’s been digging deep in therapy to find out how the experience affected her.\n\n“We made it through. We got out alive,” Obama said. “I hope we made the country proud. My girls, thank God, are whole. But what happened to me?”\n\n“Going through therapy is getting me to look at the fact that maybe, maybe finally I’m good enough,” she added.\n\nThis is the second time in the past month that Obama has publicly discussed her decision to skip Trump’s inauguration. On the “Work in Progress” podcast, hosted by actress Sophia Bush, Obama didn’t mention Trump by name but she said she had chosen to skip a “real big” event because “I chose to do what’s best for me, not what I had to do.”\n\nObama has previously been open about her dislike for Trump, who promoted the lie that her husband was not a U.S. citizen. During her speech at the 2024 Democratic National Convention, she also took digs at Trump while praising his opponent Kamala Harris.\n\n“Kamala has shown her allegiance to this nation, not by spewing anger and bitterness, but by living a life of service and always pushing the doors of opportunity open to others,” Obama said. She alluded to Trump benefiting from “generational wealth” and getting multiple chances at becoming more rich and powerful after bankrupting businesses or choking “in crisis.”\n\n“If things don’t go our way, we don’t have the luxury of whining or cheating others to get further ahead,” she said. “No. We don’t get to change the rules, so we always win.”\n\nObama also suggested that Trump was threatened by her and her husband.\n\n“His limited and narrow view of the world made him feel threatened by the existence of two hardworking, highly educated, successful people who also happened to be Black,” she said.","summary":"The former first lady had to 'trick' herself into following through on her desire to skip Trump's swearing-in.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/04/23/michelle-obama-avoided-trumps-inauguration-not-having-outfit/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/afp_kf7vq1.jpg?w=1024&h=770","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-23 17:45:51","author":"Martha Ross","authors":["Martha Ross"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.251},{"id":314090594,"title":"Pete Buttigieg Schools Podcaster for Trusting Trump Promises","text":"Pete Buttigieg defended Democrats during an appearance on comedian Andrew Schulz’ Flagrant podcast Wednesday and carefully explained to the MAGA friendly host just how many promises Donald Trump has broken.\n\nButtigieg acknowledged to Schulz and his co-hosts that Republicans were able to paint the Democratic Party as America’s villains during the 2024 election, but he argued that Democrats did much more to help everyday people than Trump has when they were in power.\n\n“Most of the stuff he said he was actually going to do, he didn’t actually do,” Buttigieg said on Wednesday.\n\nThe podcast appearance is the latest in a string of media hits for the former transportation secretary, popular Democratic surrogate, and potential 2028 presidential nominee who has urged the party to improve its anti-Trump attacks.\n\nButtigieg explained how former President Joe Biden passed a sweeping infrastructure bill, something Trump repeatedly promised to do during his first term. He also pointed out that Trump never completed construction on his long-promised wall along the Southern border.\n\n“The biggest social policy commitment that they’ve made that they actually care about to the point that they actually went through and kept it was to get rid of the right to choose,” Buttigieg said, referencing the Supreme Court’s 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, which made abortion a federal right. “Economically the biggest promise they’ve actually kept is tax cuts for the rich.”\n\nSchulz acknowledged the lack of policy progress, but he said where Republicans excelled was speaking more to their voters’ emotions.\n\n“If you want to help them, say the thing that you think they need help with out loud directly and say that you’re going to do it and then endeavor to do it,” Schulz said. “We already expect you guys not to do it so the least you could do is f---ing lie to me. You don’t even lie to me!” \n\n“Right now I don’t know—what is the platform?“ Schulz added. ”The Republicans did an amazing job of making the Democratic platform feel like—this wasn’t it at all, this was completely wrong—but it made it feel like we’re going to let the school do whatever they want to your kids’ balls.\"\n\nThe group also highlighted how effective Trump’s anti-Kamala Harris “they/them” campaign advertisement was in pigeon-holing Harris. Trump’s campaign chiefs boasted about the ad’s success after the election.\n\nButtigieg agreed, saying Republicans “talked about more about that than they talked about the economy.” But he said his focus would be to improve everyday American lives, which he claimed Republicans eager to pass new tax cuts for the ultra-rich will never do.\n\n“I want you to have good public transit to get to where you’re going, and then when you get to that job, I want you to be paid well,” Buttigieg said. “If you’re about to have a kid, I want you to know that you’re going to have parental leave when you have that kid and if you don’t want to have a kid I want you to have the the right to choose whether to have a kid.”\n\nSchulz said he agreed with Buttigieg’s ideals, but he felt that Democrats’ lack of action plans and emotional appeals contributed more to a Trump victory than Trump himself.\n\n“It seems you know exactly what we’re feeling because that was beautiful,” Schulz added. “But I need the statements that are going to satisfy those feelings because that’s what gets people to sway over and that’s what they’re f---ing good at.”\n\nButtigieg agreed that Republicans were more effective in speaking to voters, though he categorized their platform more as a “bumper sticker” messaging.\n\n“What’s a Democratic bumper sticker?” Schulz asked.\n\n“I’m working on it,” Buttigieg quipped. “And I think people need to know that we see them and we don’t see them as the problem.”\n\nFor more, listen to Andrew Schulz talk about Trump, politics, and comedy on The Last Laugh podcast.","summary":"YouTube/screengrabPete Buttigieg defended Democrats during an appearance on comedian Andrew Schulz’ Flagrant podcast Wednesday and carefully explained to the MAGA friendly host just how many promises Donald Trump has broken.\n\nButtigieg acknowledged to Schulz and his co-hosts that Republicans were able to paint the Democratic Party as America’s villains during the 2024 election, but he argued that Democrats did much more to help everyday people than Trump has when they were in power.\n\n“Most of the stuff he said he was actually going to do, he didn’t actually do,” Buttigieg said on Wednesday.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.","url":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/pete-buttigieg-schools-podcaster-andrew-schulz-for-trusting-trump-promises/","image":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/2OLA4WWHNNHSVOBJXZM5GCWPBM.png?smart=true&auth=bfd7f286cfab0ca02a7129a80608d6ece5ed6f3730c87fac336c54968e7afaa8&width=1440&height=1080","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-23 17:39:26","author":"Corbin Bolies","authors":["Corbin Bolies"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.34},{"id":314097560,"title":"21 Black Leaders Who Shaped History","text":"Late Pope Francis and U.S. President Barack Obama talk in the Oval Office during the arrival ...

He argued 32 cases before the Supreme Court, winning 29, a staggering record that included the landmark decision in Brown v. Board of Education (1954), which declared racial segregation in public schools unconstitutional. Marshall understood that laws shape lives, and he used the Constitution as both sword and shield to protect Black Americans from state-sanctioned discrimination. His courtroom victories dismantled pieces of Jim Crow brick by brick, setting the legal precedent for broader civil rights gains in the 1960s. On the bench, he continued to advocate for civil liberties, often standing as the court’s conscience on issues of racial justice, workers’ rights and the death penalty. Marshall’s legacy shapes his work as symbolic of what could be achieved when Black brilliance met institutional power. His legacy continues in every courtroom fight for equality, and in every Black child who sees themselves reflected in places once designed to exclude them.\n\nNAACP Chief Counsel Thurgood Marshall in front of the Supreme Court where he made a last-ditch ...

Shirley Chisholm\n\nField: Politics\n\nIn 1968, Shirley Chisholm made history as the first Black woman elected to the U.S. Congress, representing New York’s 12th District with a fearless, incisive and unyielding voice. But she didn’t stop there. In 1972, she launched a bid for the presidency, becoming the first Black woman to seek the nomination of a major political party. Her campaign, run on the bold slogan “Unbought and Unbossed,” was one of a kind that ignored tokenism for transformation. Chisholm’s candidacy challenged the entire political establishment. She ran not just as a symbol, but as a serious contender, openly confronting racism, sexism and political gatekeeping. Though she didn’t win the nomination, she won something deeper: she showed millions what was possible. During her seven terms in Congress, she fought tirelessly for marginalized communities, championing education, labor rights, healthcare and poverty legislation. She was a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus and the National Women’s Political Caucus, building lasting infrastructure for change. Chisholm’s life made clear that being the “first” was about breaking through so others could follow.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nGoogle Confirms Gmail Update—How To Keep Your Email Account\n\nDo Not Make Calls On Your Phone If You Get This Message\n\nGmail Hack — Google Warns Users Have 7 Days To Act\n\n3. Ida B. Wells\n\nField: Journalism and Anti-Lynching Activism\n\nBorn into slavery in 1862 in Mississippi, Ida B. Wells became one of the most fearless disruptors of her time. As a journalist, she launched an unrelenting crusade against the lynching of Black Americans, exposing it not as frontier justice, but as state-sanctioned racial terror used to uphold white supremacy. She co-owned and edited the Memphis Free Speech newspaper, where her fiery editorials drew national attention and violent backlash. White mobs destroyed her press, forcing her into exile. But Wells refused to be silenced. She documented lynchings with meticulous research and unflinching clarity, laying the groundwork for investigative journalism as a tool of justice. She was also a suffragist, co-founder of the NAACP and lifelong advocate for civil rights. In 2020, she was posthumously awarded a Pulitzer Prize, more than a century after her truth made the powerful uncomfortable and the oppressed seen.\n\nPortrait of Civil rights Leader, journalist, and one of the the Founders of the National Association ...

Garrity.\nUniversal History Archive/Universal Images Group via Getty Images\n\n4. W.E.B. Du Bois\n\nField: Academia and Political Thought\n\nWilliam Edward Burghardt Du Bois was a towering intellectual force who never separated scholarship from struggle. As the first Black American to earn a Ph.D. from Harvard, Du Bois viewed education and data as tools that could be used against racial injustice. His 1903 classic, The Souls of Black Folk, introduced the world to the concept of “double consciousness,” the psychological tension of being Black and American in a society built to deny both. As a co-founder of the NAACP in 1909, Du Bois combined journalism, activism and historical analysis to challenge white supremacy from every angle. He believed the fight for Black liberation required political organizing and cultural pride. Toward the end of his life, frustrated by the limits of U.S. progress, he moved to Ghana and renounced his American citizenship. Still, his legacy remains deeply American: a challenge to live up to the country’s ideals by confronting its truths.\n\n5. Huey P. Newton\n\nField: Revolutionary Organizing\n\nHuey P. Newton symbolized Black resistance, who leveraged strategy and community power. In 1966, alongside Bobby Seale, he co-founded the Black Panther Party in Oakland, California, aiming to protect Black neighborhoods from police brutality and to empower them through direct action. The Panthers weren’t just about carrying rifles; they fed children, ran health clinics and educated communities when the government would not. Newton’s philosophy blended Marxist theory, Black nationalism and anti-imperialism into a unique vision for liberation. The FBI’s COINTELPRO heavily targeted him, and his struggles with addiction and state repression complicated his later years. Still, Newton’s legacy lives on in the ongoing debates about community safety, mutual aid and the right to self-defense in the face of systemic violence.\n\n6. Mary McLeod Bethune\n\nField: Education and Public Service\n\nMary McLeod Bethune turned a vision into a legacy by proving that education could be the foundation of freedom. Born in 1875 to formerly enslaved parents in South Carolina, she believed literacy was the key to liberation. With just five dollars and a few students, she founded Bethune-Cookman University in Daytona Beach, Florida, one of the nation’s most prominent HBCUs. Her influence extended far beyond the classroom. As a close advisor to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, she served as the highest-ranking Black woman in the federal government. She founded the National Council of Negro Women. Bethune used every tool, including organizing, policymaking and speechmaking, to fight for equal education, voting rights and gender equity. Her will, a poetic list of values passed down to future generations, still circulates today as a manifesto of Black dignity and hope.\n\n7. Sojourner Truth\n\nField: Abolition and Women’s Rights\n\nSojourner Truth was born enslaved in 1797, but she spent her life making sure no one could ignore her truth. After escaping slavery with her infant daughter in 1826, she became a traveling preacher and electrifying orator. Her most famous speech, “Ain’t I a Woman?” delivered in 1851 at a women’s rights convention, dismantled the racist and sexist arguments used to exclude Black women from feminist and abolitionist circles. Truth spoke with fire and moral force, advocating for the rights of the enslaved, people with low incomes and women in a nation not yet ready to see them as fully human. She also fought for land rights and reparations for freed people after the Civil War, well before those conversations became part of national discourse. Truth’s name was prophetic, and she forced the nation to confront its contradictions and listen to the voices it tried to silence.\n\n8. Benjamin O. Davis Sr.\n\nField: Military\n\nBenjamin O. Davis Sr. broke military barriers when he became the first Black general in the U.S. Army in 1940, a symbolic victory in a military still governed by segregation. Over his nearly five decades of service, Davis navigated the contradiction of serving a country that did not grant full citizenship to Black people. He led with integrity, proving that excellence was not the exception but the expectation. His leadership helped lay the groundwork for integrating the armed forces, which President Truman ordered in 1948. Davis’s legacy paved the way for his son, Benjamin O. Davis Jr., who became the commander of the Tuskegee Airmen. Together, their lives told a story of discipline, dignity and defiance in uniform.\n\n9. Mae Jemison\n\nField: Science and Space\n\nWhen Mae Jemison boarded the Endeavour in 1992, she didn’t just become the first Black woman in space; she redefined the possibilities of Black achievement in science. A physician, engineer and multilingual dancer, Jemison shattered stereotypes in multiple fields before ever stepping onto a launchpad. She later founded The Jemison Group and the Dorothy Jemison Foundation for Excellence, promoting science education and innovation in underserved communities. Jemison also served as a role model on screen, appearing in Star Trek: The Next Generation, and used her platform to argue that inclusion in STEM revolved around both access and imagination. Her presence in space told generations of Black girls: this universe includes you, too.\n\n10. Barack Obama\n\nField: Politics\n\nIn 2008, Barack Obama was elected the 44th President of the United States, becoming the first Black person to hold the office. His campaign, built on hope, change and grassroots momentum, mobilized millions and shattered centuries of racial exclusion from the nation’s highest seat of power. A constitutional scholar and former community organizer, Obama signed into law the Affordable Care Act, repealed “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” and ordered the killing of Osama bin Laden. But outside of policy, his presidency was a symbol of possibility, especially for young Black Americans. His presence in the Oval Office didn’t end racism, but it changed forever who could sit in the chair.\n\n11. Michelle Obama\n\nField: Public Health, Education and Cultural Leadership\n\nAs the first Black First Lady, Michelle Obama redefined the role with intelligence, grace and substance. A lawyer and Princeton- and Harvard-educated professional in her own right, she launched national initiatives like “Let’s Move!” to combat childhood obesity, “Reach Higher” to promote education, and “Let Girls Learn” to support global education for young women. Through her bestselling memoir Becoming and wildly successful book tours, she inspired millions to own their stories. Michelle Obama has become one of the most trusted voices in American public life, offering visibility, relatability and a bold message: a person’s background doesn’t limit their impact.\n\nFormer US First Lady Michelle Obama arrives to speak on the second day of the Democratic National ...

Kamala Harris\n\nField: Politics and Law\n\nIn 2020, Kamala Harris became the first Black, first South Asian and first woman to serve as Vice President of the United States. As a former U.S. senator and attorney general of California, Harris built her career in public service with a focus on civil rights, consumer protection and criminal justice reform. Her historic election was both historic and seismic and her presence in the White House cracked multiple glass ceilings at once and redefined the future of American political leadership. Whether leading pandemic recovery efforts or standing in global diplomatic forums, Harris continues to represent a bold shift in power and possibility. Though Harris’s 2024 presidential bid was ultimately unsuccessful, her campaign created a turning point that came with serious conversations around American politics.\n\n13. Malcolm X\n\nField: Black Nationalism & Human Rights\n\nBefore the world recognized him as Malcolm X, he was Malcolm Little, shaped by poverty, racial violence and the prison system. Through discipline, study and transformation, he became a minister in the Nation of Islam and a bold voice for Black self-determination. He rejected respectability politics and told the truth without softening the blow. Later in life, he expanded his global view, broke with the NOI, and began advocating for Pan-African unity and human rights on the world stage. His evolution was ongoing until it was cut short in 1965. Even now, his insistence on Black pride, dignity and power resonates with those who believe freedom can’t be begged for, but must be built.\n\n14. Angela Davis\n\nField: Abolitionist Theory & Academia\n\nAs a scholar, author and former political prisoner, Angela Davis didn’t ask for attention, but she demanded justice for those who were marginalized. Davis spent decades pushing the conversation beyond surface-level reform and did everything from critiquing the prison system to fighting racial and gender oppression. Her ideas about prison abolition and intersectional justice were radical when she started, but now they’re central to mainstream debates. Through her work, Davis has helped shift not just what we fight, but how we imagine freedom. Thanks to her lectures, books and grassroots organizing, she’s helped redefine what liberation can look like, which is not just inclusion in broken systems but the transformation of those systems altogether. Today, her vision still guides movements fighting mass incarceration, police violence and systemic inequality around the world.\n\n15. Fred Hampton\n\nField: Revolutionary Organizing\n\nAt 21, Fred Hampton led the Illinois chapter of the Black Panther Party and built the original Rainbow Coalition, aligning poor Black, Latino and white communities against systemic inequality. He spoke with power, clarity and conviction, delivering speeches that moved crowds and scared officials. Under his leadership, the Panthers launched free breakfast programs, community health clinics, education initiatives and political education classes that directly served the people the government overlooked. His ability to organize across race, class and ideology terrified the state, which saw his growing influence as a threat to the status quo. That’s why he was killed in his sleep during a 1969 FBI-led raid, orchestrated in coordination with the Chicago Police Department. But Hampton left behind a model for what it means to lead with both revolutionary fire and grassroots love. His legacy lives on in every mutual aid program, every radical coalition and every generation that refuses to let justice be delayed.\n\n16. Ella Baker\n\nField: Community Organizing\n\nElla Baker believed movements should be built from the ground up, not from behind a podium. As a longtime strategist and organizer, she worked with the NAACP, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) and helped launch the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). Baker believed in grassroots power and rejected the idea of charismatic, top-down leadership, famously saying, “Strong people don’t need strong leaders.” She mentored young organizers who would later shape the Civil Rights Movement in their own right, and she quietly redefined what leadership could look like: not spotlight-driven, but sustained and collective. Baker's organizing model laid the foundation for future decentralized movements, from Black Power to Black Lives Matter. Her legacy isn’t tied to one speech or moment; it’s in the thousands of people she empowered to fight for their freedom.\n\n17. Fannie Lou Hamer\n\nField: Voting Rights\n\nFannie Lou Hamer knew the price of speaking truth in the Deep South. A sharecropper turned powerhouse activist, she put her life on the line to demand that Black people have the right to vote and be counted. In 1962, she was fired and beaten for attempting to register to vote. Two years later, as co-founder of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, she testified before the Democratic National Convention, detailing the abuse she endured just for trying to exercise a constitutional right. Her televised testimony shocked the nation and exposed the violent reality of Jim Crow. She didn’t speak like a politician but spoke like someone who had lived it. That authenticity and her steady moral compass made her one of the most respected voices in the movement. Hamer reminded the country that democracy doesn’t work if it only serves the powerful. And she proved that even without formal education or political backing, one voice can shake the system.\n\n18. Claudette Colvin\n\nField: Civil Rights\n\nBefore her name was widely known, Claudette Colvin made history as a teenager who refused to give in. In March 1955, at just 15 years old, she defied a segregated bus system in Montgomery, Alabama, nine months before Rosa Parks would do the same. Arrested and forcibly removed from the bus, Colvin’s bold act was fueled by her classroom lessons on Black history and a deep sense of justice. Despite her bravery, she was pushed to the margins of the movement due to her age, working-class background and later, her pregnancy. Regardless, she became a key plaintiff in Browder v. Gayle, the court case that ultimately struck down bus segregation. Colvin’s story challenges the idea that only certain people get to make history. She wasn’t the \"perfect\" symbol, but she was a fighter. And her early act of resistance helped legally dismantle one of the most visible forms of Southern segregation.\n\nBlack and white photo of Claudette Colvin.\nThe Washington Post via Getty Images\n\n19. Bayard Rustin\n\nField: Civil Rights Strategy\n\nBayard Rustin was the tactical genius behind many of the Civil Rights Movement’s most pivotal moments. A Quaker, pacifist and lifelong advocate of nonviolent resistance, Rustin was the lead organizer of the 1963 March on Washington. This logistical feat brought over 250,000 people to the nation’s capital and gave a global stage to Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech. But Rustin's role was often downplayed. He was openly gay in a homophobic era and had past ties to socialism, facts that many civil rights leaders saw as political liabilities. Still, Rustin was resolute. He mentored King, introduced him to Gandhian principles of nonviolence, and served as a behind-the-scenes architect of some of the movement’s most effective campaigns. Later in life, Rustin also became a vocal advocate for LGBTQ rights and global human rights. His story is a testament to how transformative leadership doesn’t always live in the spotlight, and how true visionaries work whether or not they get the credit.\n\n20. DeRay Mckesson\n\nField: Activism & Policy Reform\n\nAs a former school administrator turned activist, DeRay Mckesson became one of the most recognizable voices in the fight against police violence. He used social media to document protests in real time, connect movements across cities, and create a digital front line. His tweets from Ferguson after the killing of Michael Brown were seen by millions, helping to mobilize a new generation of organizers and turn local outrage into a national movement. The momentum of his work helped McKesson co-found Campaign Zero in 2015, a data-driven policy platform that offers concrete solutions to end police brutality and reform public safety systems. His activism sits at the intersection of technology, narrative and public policy. Whether on the streets, in front of a camera, or inside a city council chamber, McKesson represents a new generation of Black leadership that is raw, unapologetic, informed and willing to take the fight wherever it needs to go.\n\n21. Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nField: Civil Rights & Moral Leadership\n\nMartin Luther King Jr. was more than a dreamer, he was a strategic, moral and important force in one of the most consequential social movements in U.S. history. As a Baptist minister and theologian, King brought nonviolent resistance to the center of the Civil Rights Movement, combining the teachings of Gandhi with the urgency of Black liberation. He led key campaigns across the South, from the Montgomery Bus Boycott to the Birmingham protests, and delivered some of the most iconic speeches of the 20th century, including “I Have a Dream,” which moved a nation and inspired the world. But King was surveilled, arrested and ultimately assassinated for challenging not just racism, but militarism and economic inequality. In his later years, he focused on the interconnected struggles of poverty and war, launching the Poor People’s Campaign to build a multiracial movement for economic justice.\n\nEditorial StandardsForbes Accolades","summary":"Discover 21 influential Black leaders who changed history through activism, politics, education, science and justice.","url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/sughnenyongo/2025/04/23/black-leaders-who-shaped-history/","image":"https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/68082295f2545b55649e7a36/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-23 17:38:27","author":"Contributor,Sughnen Yongo","authors":["Contributor","Sughnen Yongo"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.283},{"id":314116634,"title":"Paramount Chair Shari Redstone Throws Down After ‘60 Minutes’ Producer Resigns: Media Must ‘Give the Facts, Not Opinions’","text":"Paramount Global non-executive chairwoman Shari Redstone has warned that the news media must present “facts” and “not opinions” on the tail of the resignation of embattled 60 Minutes executive producer Bill Owens.\n\nSpeaking to TheWrap, Redstone insisted that the media has an important role in America and it isn’t merely to indulge its “free speech.”\n\n“There is nothing controversial about telling the truth,” Redstone explained. “There’s nothing controversial about getting the real story out there. And I think companies have not only an opportunity, but a tremendous responsibility, to use the resources that they have to tell these stories and to get them to as many audiences, let people decide how they feel about something and how they react to something, but give them the facts.”\n\nShe also said that “freedom of the press” can be misused by partisans who only tell one side of a story.\n\n“I don’t think there’s ever a time you have to compromise what it is that you say and do, but freedom of the press involves telling both sides of the story, giving the facts, not giving opinions. And I think that’s our responsibility as a media company,” she continued.\n\nRedstone also said that the media seemed to be better in the days of Walter Cronkite.\n\n“The days of Walter Cronkite, where, whatever it is, people believed in the truth, people really crave the information they need to be independent and make their own judgments. That’s what freedom of speech is,” she insisted.\n\nRedstone’s comments came only hours after 60 Minutes executive producer Bill Owens resigned from the show claiming he was being interfered with by his superiors.\n\n“Over the past months, it has become clear that I would not be allowed to run the show as I have always run it, to make independent decisions based on what was right for 60 Minutes, right for the audience.” Owens claimed as he announced his resignation, according to the New York Post.\n\n“So, having defended this show — and what we stand for — from every angle, over time with everything I could, I am stepping aside so the show can move forward,” Owens concluded.\n\nOwens’ vacating his post comes as President Donald Trump’s lawsuit against CBS bears down on the troubled network.\n\nIn November of last year, the President filed suit against CBS for a “deceptive” interview with Kamala Harris that Trump contended was severely edited and was aimed solely at defeating his presidential campaign.\n\nTrump’s lawsuit alleges that CBS was acting an adjunct to Harris’s campaign and the filing concerned “CBS’ partisan and unlawful acts of election and voter interference through malicious, deceptive, and substantial news distortion calculated to confuse, deceive, and mislead the public.”\n\nIn February, a federal judge denied a motion filed by CBS to dismiss the lawsuit against its 60 Minutes program as the Trump team upped its ante by demanding $20 billion in damages, up from its initial $10 billion.\n\nAmid all this fallout, there are conflicting stories about Redstone’s internal reactions to Trump’s lawsuit. Some reports say that Redstone has been putting heavy scrutiny on 60 Minutes to make sure the program stops over indulging its left-wing partisanship and wanted Owens to be removed from his position. But other reports, such as that from The Wrap, insist that Redstone has no role with and taken no actions against 60 Minutes.\n\nOwens has not been much of a success at CBS, though. His efforts to revamp the CBS Evening News has crashed and burned and he has been accused of being a mouthpiece for the Democrat Party.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Facebook at: facebook.com/Warner.Todd.Huston, X at WTHuston, or Truth Social at @WarnerToddHuston.","summary":"Paramount Global non-executive chairwoman Shari Redstone has warned that the news media must present \"facts\" and \"not opinions\" on the tail of the resignation of embattled \"60 Minutes\" executive producer Bill Owens.\n\n\nThe post Paramount Chair Shari Redstone Throws Down After ‘60 Minutes’ Producer Resigns: Media Must ‘Give the Facts, Not Opinions’ appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2025/04/23/paramount-chair-shari-redstone-throws-down-after-60-minutes-producer-resigns-media-must-give-the-facts-not-opinions/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/04/ShariRedstone-640x335.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-23 17:26:13","author":"Warner Todd Huston","authors":["Warner Todd Huston"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.005},{"id":314154660,"title":"Nolte: Disgraced Crybaby ’60 Minutes’ Executive Producer Resigns in a Snit","text":"Crybaby and documented serial liar Bill Owens announced his resignation Tuesday as executive producer of the disgraced far-left 60 Minutes.\n\nI voted for this.\n\nOwens announced his exit in a memo to the disgraced, far-left 60 Minutes staff where he whined over how he “would not be allowed to run the show as I have always run it” or make “independent decisions based on what was right for 60 Minutes.”\n\nMaybe it’s just me, but maybe the guy responsible for damaging the 60 Minutes brand more than any human being not named Dan Rather could use a little oversight.\n\nAfter all, it was under Bill Owens’ leadership that 60 Minutes straight-up lied to the American people about Hunter Biden’s laptop being “Russian disinformation,” lied about the lab leak, lied about the USAID staff cuts, engaged in the deliberate and malicious editing of Gov.

He’s then joined by former Acting Attorney General Peter Keisler to explore what America’s institutions can realistically do to counter Trump’s executive overreach—and the serious risks facing the courts, the Federal Reserve, and the American public if Trump continues unchecked. Finally, David answers listener questions on Republican contempt for blue states, the importance of reclaiming the term globalist, and how citizens can effectively fight back.\n\nThe following is a transcript of the episode:\n\nDavid Frum: Hello. Welcome to the third episode of The David Frum Show. I’m David Frum, a staff writer at The Atlantic. This week, my guest will be Peter Keisler, former acting attorney general of the United States under President George W. Bush, former head of the civil division at the Department of Justice, a veteran of the conservative legal community. He clerked for Supreme Court Justice [Anthony] Kennedy and for Judge Robert Bork.\n\nI have known Peter, also, as a friend for nearly half a century. He’s someone in whom I have enormous confidence in and for whom I have great respect. And I think as you listen to him today, you will see why, because of his extraordinary breadth of interest and depth of knowledge. I’m so grateful that he joined us.\n\nOur theme will be issues of law and due process of law. And before I begin my conversation with Peter Keisler, let me offer some introductory thoughts on the subject.\n\nAs we’ve seen, the Supreme Court of the United States has rebuked the Trump administration for its contemptuous attitude toward courts and toward the dozens of people it has sent to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador without a hearing, without even allowing them to challenge that the government has got the right person.\n\nThose detained people have now been in—supposedly the custody of El Salvador—in fact, in the custody of the United States government, because the United States government is paying millions of dollars to the government of El Salvador to hold these prisoners. They’ve been there now for five weeks, as I speak, without a hearing, without any show that the government has got the right person, incommunicado, and apparently for life. Now, it does look like there have been at least some instances of mistaken arrest, that some of these people may be outright innocent. Others may be genuinely bad actors. Who can know? Because there’s been no show of proof, no hearing of any kind.\n\nUnited States law allows for a quite expedited process to remove people from the country, to deport them. You don’t get a big trial. You don’t get a jury trial. You are moved rapidly because the theory of the case is: First, you don’t have a right to immigrate to the United States, so you have not been deprived of your rights. And secondly, once you’re removed from the United States, you remain a free person. You are sent back to the place you came from or some other place to which you have some connection, and then you’re free to go about your business. You’re not sent to a prison—not sent to a prison for life.\n\nBut as I talk about this, the thing that has most gripped my mind with worry and anxiety is not only the effect on the individuals themselves, some of whom may be genuinely innocent, but the effect on those who are sending human beings to a prison without a hearing.\n\nYou know, the United States government is now building an apparatus of lawyers, of officials of all kinds, who plan and think every day, How can we apprehend people on American soil and bundle them to a prison without giving them any show of a hearing? They’re building skills and competencies at non-due-process forms of arrest and incarceration that are going to be very hard to limit.\n\nThere are many kinds of immigration status that people present in the United States have. There are citizens, of course. There are permanent residents. There are people here on many different kinds of visas. Now, you can lose your visa rapidly for many reasons. I remember when I was a Canadian citizen in the United States on a student visa, we were warned if you got into a bar fight, you could theoretically lose your student visa. Now, in those days, that meant that you’d have to go back to Canada and go to school in Canada, which is not the end of the world. In today’s America, that could mean you could lose your student visa and be accused of terrorism, and a bag put over your head and be put into a car and sent to a prison in El Salvador for the rest of your life.\n\nNow, maybe that doesn’t happen in every case. Maybe that doesn’t happen in many cases. But there are people in the employ of the United States government, paid by taxpayers to think about how can we daily broaden the category of people who can be arrested and detained and imprisoned without any showing to any authority at all, without any opportunity to make themselves heard, without any evaluation by an independent fact finder—by any of the things we call due process.\n\nDue process is not just one thing. American law—the American Constitution—specify different kinds of process for different kinds of crime. The crime of treason, for example, is defined in the Constitution as waging war upon the United States or giving aid and comfort to its enemies. And the Constitution then lists some very strict rules that have to be met to prosecute somebody for treason.\n\nThe rules for armed robbery and other things—even as strict as they are—are not as strict as that. Then there are rules for criminal prosecution. Then there are rules for immigration hearings, and there are other kinds of rules. We’ve all encountered traffic courts. You get a hearing if you want one. If you don’t, you can choose to pay the ticket, or you can contest the ticket. And then you don’t get a jury of your peers. You don’t get any of the other apparatus of criminal law, but you still get some kind of process. Always, the law says, the word of authority is not to be taken for its own sake. And we have that practice, not just to constrain authority, but to allow all of us to live lives of dignity.\n\nA thing it means to live in a free society is that you can encounter the look of a police officer without fear. You do not feel like you must cringe and defer. You do not feel you are in the hands of someone who can do anything to you at any whim. You know that so long as you are following the clear and specific rules of the land, which are available to all to know, you can go about your business and meet the eyes of power without fear.\n\nThe Trump administration is changing all of that. Lots of people who have lots of different statuses—who are here for limited periods of time, who are here under conditions, who are not full citizens, but who are not illegal either—are now living lives of fear. Ordinary tourists are being apprehended, detained for days, sometimes for longer than that, treated in inhumane and indecent ways, and then deported from the country without showing that they had done anything wrong, other than maybe not having a hotel room booked at the time that they arrived.\n\nWe are building a society that is governed by fear, led by people who want to rule by fear. That’s not right. It’s not humane. It’s not American. It’s not democratic. It’s not decent. It needs to stop. And that’s what I’ll be discussing with Peter Keisler today.\n\nFrum: But first, a quick break.\n\nFrum: Peter Keisler, welcome to The David Frum Show, and thank you for joining.\n\nPeter Keisler: It’s a pleasure to be here, David.\n\nFrum: So we’re going to be talking some about transparency in the next few minutes, and in the interest of transparency, let me disclose: You and I have known each other for—I don’t know that either of us would be comfortable in using the exact number—but suffice it to say, we were both typing papers on typewriters at the time when we got to know each other.\n\nKeisler: Right. And that was a great time. I still think about it very fondly, and one of the things I think about fondly is our long conversations over lunches and dinners and dining halls.\n\nFrum: Well, you’re very kind to remember all of that. We both started on the political right. You were active in the conservative legal movement. I think it’s fair to say that your legal views are probably quite continuous with where they were all those years ago, but you found yourself—because of those legal views—in a different political situation from where you were all those years ago.\n\nKeisler: I think that’s true. Look—I mean, I voted for Hillary Clinton, for Joe Biden, and for Kamala Harris. You know, I was actually walking the streets in Pennsylvania this last year, knocking on doors for Kamala Harris. I never thought I would be doing that, frankly, for anyone. It’s not what I used to be doing to contribute to campaigns, and I certainly didn’t think I would be doing that in that setting for the Democratic candidate.\n\nBut look—I had always thought myself a conservative, because I believed in things like a strong and robust foreign policy to oppose authoritarianism abroad, in free markets, and personal liberties, and in constitutional values that underpin our democracy. I still believe in all of those things. I don’t think the current administration believes in any of them. And if that’s what conservative has come to mean, then I just decided quite a while ago that I didn’t want any part of it.\n\nFrum: And yet on issues of the role of the judiciary, how statutes should be interpreted, have you changed your mind about those things? Or do you find yourself there saying, Yeah, that is still what I thought—you know, what I thought then I think now?\n\nKeisler: Largely so. I mean, look—we all, over time as things happen, our ideas adjust in different ways to take into account new facts and new information. But on the whole, I still believe in the same thing about the courts that I always have.\n\nFrum: Speaking of the courts, let’s start with the Supreme Court’s recent rebuke to the administration about due process rights of people it has detained and sent to foreign prisons. How big a story is this? I mean, you have represented the United States so long and so well. How big a story is this?\n\nKeisler: What’s happening now is unprecedented and really serious. I mean, in some of the most high-profile cases out there, the administration’s been acting with what could only be described as contempt towards court orders. And that’s playing out most vividly in the cases involving their efforts to remove and keep people in the United States in that prison in El Salvador. And that those cases are really, at one level, very, very simple. And that’s unusual for a legal matter. Most of them are complex to some degrees, but this one is simple.\n\nAnd just to back up: The administration had what it thought was a good two-part legal strategy for how to get certain people out of the country in ways that would not require them to ever go to any court and present evidence or justify the legal basis for what they were doing.\n\nPart 1 of that strategy was an internal decision that, under a statute known as the Alien Enemies Act, they could bundle people into planes without giving them any notice about what was about to happen, spirit them out of the country, and do that so quickly that, as a practical matter, they wouldn’t be able to get into court to stop that from happening.\n\nAnd then Part 2 of the strategy is—once they are out of the country and in that prison in El Salvador, if they try to file cases—to say, Well, it’s a fait accompli now. They’re no longer in our custody. They’re in the custody of a foreign government. So there’s nothing a court can do. \n\nSo, you know, even though there is a precept, which is deeply wired into the DNA of the country—and certainly in the Constitution—that everybody gets their day in court, under this approach, it would always be either too early or too late for them to get into court.\n\nAnd what happened is the Supreme Court dealt what could only be described as a death blow to both aspects of that legal strategy. The Court held with no reported dissent that, no, you can’t hustle people out of the country in this way without giving them sufficient notice to enable them to go to court and challenge that if they wish to. And they also held, on the other part, that a court can direct the administration to do what it is able to do to get somebody returned who’s been erroneously removed.\n\nFrum: Now, defenders of the administration will say, Wait a minute. Are you saying there has to be a jury trial for every person who’s in the United States illegally? It’s probably worth clarifying here that for a deportation where the deported person gets off the bus or the plane and is then at liberty, the process can be very, very expedited. The United States deports a quarter of a million people a year, and it removes many more than that without even the formality of a deportation. But the key to the streamlined, simplified process that leads to so many deportations is: Once you’re off the bus, you’re a free person. I think that’s a point that we need to underscore here.\n\nKeisler: Absolutely. We are not talking about weeks-long jury trials. We are talking about there’s no jury at all. This is before either an immigration judge, or it can ultimately be before, you know, a federal judge. But the key, the minimum baseline is you have an opportunity both to present evidence—factual evidence—and to make legal arguments that the administration doesn’t have the authority to do this, and some independent decision maker will make a judgment as to whether or not they have a right to deport you.\n\nSo it is a very minimal level of due process, and it is not itself an extraordinarily time-consuming fact, but it does require the administration to submit to some neutral testing of its legal theory and its evidence.\n\nFrum: At a minimum, the person gets to say, You’ve got the wrong person. I may have the same name as this other person, but actually, I’m here on this visa or this status. You’ve got the wrong guy. You should be able to say that.\n\nKeisler: Right. And to translate this to our current context, it would mean saying, They’re saying I’m a member of Tren de Aragua, this Venezuelan gang, because I have a tattoo that looks like what they say is a logo of the gang. But in fact, that tattoo is something I put on 20 years ago because it’s my favorite soccer team, or something like that. And a judge would scrutinize the evidence.\n\nAnd so the administration really, once it lost on these basic legal principles in the court, it had a very straightforward way to respond, which would be just to say, We acknowledge that these people in El Salvador are there only because we are paying millions of dollars to El Salvador to house them for us. So they are in our custody, effectively, both legally and practically. And their lawyers can file habeas petitions and present whatever evidence they can that what was done was unlawful. We can respond, and whatever a court decides, we’ll do.\n\nAnd as to the guy in Maryland, who they’ve already conceded was erroneously deported, they could bring him back and then give him whatever process, and maybe he can be removed to another country. All of that would be for a judge to decide. All that’s being asked of the administration is that they go through that process. But whether because—well, I think it’s a mix of political reasons, ideological reasons, psychological, even pathological reasons—they are incapable of doing that. They want this fight, and it’s turned into a big power struggle. And that’s where it ceases being so simple.\n\nFrum: Correct me if I’m wrong, but my impression is the federal courts have gone very, very far out of the way to avoid conflict with the first and then the second Trump administrations. And in between, they went even further because they seem to have greatly welcomed delay on all the criminal matters, hoping that somehow all this problem would go away—it would be resolved by some other decision maker, some other branch of government or public opinion or something—and they could be left well out of it.\n\nAnd it culminated with the decision about the president’s exposure to criminal liability, which is like this complete castle-in-the-air legal structure that seems just to be based on, We’re going to lick our finger, put it up in the wind, and do a three-part balancing test based on no kind of ever previous authority. But mostly, what we’re trying to do here is just keep this off our docket. And if I’m right in saying that, then that makes this recent decision even more remarkable because for once, the Supreme Court is going all in to say something to the administration it doesn’t want to hear.\n\nKeisler: I think that’s absolutely right. And if you want a really extraordinary example of that, you would look at the order that the Court issued at 1 a.m. on Saturday morning this last weekend, because even though they had held that everybody has to be given meaningful notice before they could be removed in this way, there was credible evidence that the administration was loading people onto buses without giving them anything like the notice that was required. And the ACLU went to the Supreme Court and said, you know, Please, as you listen to the rest of this case and get briefing, stop this from happening.\n\nAnd if the administration were a normal administration and had compiled a record so far of being a normal administration, the Court would’ve said, Well, I can be confident they’re not going to do this while we are hearing your petition, so let’s give the government a chance to respond. Let’s see what they say, and then we’ll decide what to do. Because, of course, the government wouldn’t spirit these people away while we are actually in the process of deciding whether it can do so on this emergency application you filed. But they knew that the government had done exactly that with the first 200 or so people they had sent away.\n\nThe case was before a district judge, and they rushed to secretly get the people out before he could issue an order. And they didn’t quite succeed on that, which is why you have these issues of contempt floating around now. But at 1 a.m., the Court by a 7–2 vote said, Don’t remove anybody in the class represented by these lawyers until you hear otherwise from us. \n\nAnd that shows that there is a cost to the administration of acting the way it’s acting towards the courts, because if you squander the reputation that governments of both parties have had for credibility and fair dealing and honest brokering with the Court, then they’re going to treat you different because they know they can’t quite trust you.\n\nFrum: Well, but as we play this game out, who wins? Because in the end, the Court counts on the government to comply. And if the government doesn’t comply, and again doesn’t comply—if it shows contempt, and the Department of Justice refuses to do anything about the contempt—at the end of this chain of escalation, doesn’t the executive win?\n\nKeisler: Well, that’s a really good question, because look—if you and I were disobeying a court order in a private case, there’s a very available tool kit that courts have to deal with that. We would face punishing fines, perhaps daily fines, until we comply, and we could even be incarcerated. It’s much harder, much trickier to apply that tool kit when the executive branch as a whole—not simply some rogue actor in it, but the executive branch as a whole—is the one that’s in defiance.\n\nAnd in particular—and I think this is embedded in your question—a particular order that essentially directs the executive branch to conduct diplomacy is especially hard to enforce. If the Court had ordered, you know, that the government pay somebody money, that’s an easier matter. Or even turn the planes around, as was the case in one of these cases—that’s a binary thing. You either comply or you don’t. The planes turn around or they don’t. But the Court can’t deal directly with the president of El Salvador, so they’ve essentially directed the president to do what he can to get them out.\n\nNow, you know, this is an easy matter because, as I said, they’re only there because we’re paying to house them. El Salvador has no independent—and so the administration just needs to ask. And I would just say this about that, which is that right now they’ve made it easy to see their contempt, because they’re not even asking. The attorney general has said, “He’s not coming [home] … End of [the] story.” Those are her words.\n\nBut let’s say they were just a little bit more smarmy about it, right? Let’s say they sent a letter: Dear President Bukele, an unelected federal judge without, in our view, any legal basis has directed us to try to get Mr. Abrego Garcia home. So we are conveying that request. Your friend, Marco. \n\nFrum: (Laughs.)\n\nKeisler: And President Bukele looks at that letter, and he can read the subtext as well as the rest of us, and says no. And then the administration goes back to court, with a kind of a cartoon halo above its head, and said, Well, Your Honor, we tried, but he said no. Now, the Court can find them in contempt because she can read the subtext just as well as President Bukele and the rest of us. But that still doesn’t get the man home, and it’s very hard for a court to work its will directly on a process that’s so necessarily entrusted to the actual carrying out and implementation by the executive branch.\n\nFrum: On this larger question of defiance, a thing I find myself thinking about a lot is the president’s threats to Jerome Powell at the Federal Reserve. Now, the rule we all thought we knew is that the president of the United States cannot fire the chairman of the Federal Reserve for policy reasons. And Jerome Powell has, as recently as last week in an interview at the Economic Club of Chicago, stated, That’s the conventional view. You cannot fire me for policy reasons.\n\nBut we also used to have a strong tradition that was preserved by every president from Jimmy Carter to Barack Obama that the president couldn’t fire the head of the FBI for policy reasons. And some presidents, like Ronald Reagan and Obama, cohabited with an FBI director appointed by the opposite party for six or seven years before the term expired. And the one case where an FBI director was removed was by President Clinton. And that was a case where he’d inherited an FBI director from the Bush administration and also a big dossier from the Bush administration saying, Please fire this guy for fiddling his expense accounts, which may or may not have been fair—let’s bracket that.\n\nBut H. W. Bush’s attorney general, [Bill] Barr, the same as Trump’s second attorney general, had said, Look—we’ve compiled this dossier here. We think you should get rid of him. And the Clinton people squirmed and stalled and tried to entice the director to leave voluntarily, and fired him only at the end, but not for a political reason, but for cause: the alleged fiddling with the expense accounts.\n\nTrump fired two FBI directors, both for political reasons, in his first term and his second, and then appointed a creature of his as FBI director and got him confirmed by the Senate and a deputy who’s an even more embarrassing creature, if possible, than the director. And that tradition is over. The FBI director is no longer independent of the president. The FBI director is a complete tool of the president. Why couldn’t that happen at the Federal Reserve?\n\nKeisler: Well, it potentially could. But let’s talk about that, because it’s important to distinguish between the president’s power to fire Jerome Powell and the president’s power to demote him, because those actually stand on somewhat different footings.\n\nAnd let’s start with the firing. But let me just step back and give a little of the background here, because the important thing to know is that the Federal Reserve Board has been the ghastly specter that has haunted the debate about the extent of the president’s removal power over officers for many, many years. And I’ll explain what I mean by that.\n\nBut just some additional background for your listeners: The default rule has always been that, with a few exceptions, if the president appointed you, the president can fire you. He could call up Marco Rubio tomorrow and say, Marco, you’ve done nothing wrong. You’ve been a great secretary of state, but I want Steve Witkoff, and so I am firing you right now. And at the end of that phone call, Marco Rubio would be a private citizen. The president doesn’t have to have a reason, doesn’t have to get anyone else’s approval. He’s gone.\n\nAnd actually, that’s true of the FBI director too. The FBI director has a 10-year term by statute, and that was designed to give him some measure of independence. And there’s been a norm that presidents have mostly not removed their FBI directors, except for cause before Trump. But in fact, the statute doesn’t say he can’t be removed earlier than that. And because there is this default rule that says if the president appointed you, the president can fire you, that actually is generally accepted that, as bad as it is, it applies to the FBI director too.\n\nBut there is a small subset, mostly and most prominently, the regulatory commissioners at some of the key regulatory agencies, like the Federal Trade Commission and the National Labor Relations Board. Congress has written into those statutes not only a specified term, usually four years, but has specifically said, The president cannot remove you except for—there’s language like malfeasance or neglect of duty or inefficiency.\n\nAnd back during the New Deal, the Supreme Court upheld Congress’s power to restrict the president’s ability to fire under certain circumstances. But there has been a long-standing debate—and one that predates Donald Trump—among scholars over whether or not that decision was right and whether or not Congress really should have that power. And the trend of Court decisions over the last several years has been to be increasingly skeptical of Congress’s power to limit that. But they’ve never quite gone so far as to overrule that key New Deal precedent. And part of it has been the haunting specter of the Federal Reserve Board, because the board of governors are one of those agencies where Congress has written in, You can only fire for cause.\n\nAnd so if you are on the side of the people who want the Court to permit Congress to do that, and some cases come up—as they’re coming up now involving the president’s firing of FTC commissioners or National Labor Relation Board members—if you are on that side, the first thing you are saying is, My God, Court, don’t do this. Because if the logic and reasoning of their position supports that, it also supports being able to fire J. Powell, and everybody understands what a disaster it would be if our monetary policy were subject to that kind of direct political control.\n\nAnd if you’re on the other side—if you are arguing in favor of the president’s power to remove—there are a few exceptions, but most people and anyone litigating the case before the court is saying, No, no, that’s different. The Fed is unique. Monetary policy is unique. I can come up with some reasons to distinguish it.\n\nSo that’s been kind of a long background. But what will the Court do? Right now, there are cases bubbling up and before the Court involving other agencies. The president hasn’t fired J. Powell, as you know, in part because he doesn’t want to contaminate those cases by making that vivid how much might be at stake. In those cases, the Court is perfectly capable of saying, Arguments about the Federal Reserve Board are not before us. We’re not going to decide that here. Even if they uphold the president’s right to fire FTC commissioners and NLRB members and so on, they can say, There are arguments out there that the Fed is different, and we will wait to address them for another day.\n\nAnd that day may never come, because, you know, last week the president said—I mean, it was almost a joke—he said, “Powell’s termination can’t come fast enough [for me]!” Well, he’s the president. He hasn’t been shy about pushing the legal envelope. If he really wants to fire J. Powell, he would try to.\n\nFrum: But when Trump says things like that, there’s a whole school of thought, which was, Well, Trump may say these things, but he would never actually do them. And that school of thought looks pretty battered. After January 6, you have to assume that anything Trump is talking about doing is something he might actually do.\n\nKeisler: I think you have to assume the possibility. I don’t think he loved the experience when the stock market dived because of the tariffs, and he may not want to provoke a similar one, but he could wake up one morning and just be motivated to do it. And that’s why I mentioned at the outset this distinction between firing and demoting, because if he was going to do it, I think he would.\n\nAnd by demoting, what I mean is this: So J. Powell is chair of the seven-member board of governors. The decision to designate one of the governors as chair, the provisions in the statute about that don’t have the same tenure protections that being a governor does. So if the president, instead of saying to J. Powell, You’re fired. You’re now a private citizen, like that Marco Rubio guy I was referring to earlier—if he instead said, You’re still a governor, but you’re no longer the chair, there would be, I think, a stronger basis for him to argue: Look—Congress has never limited that particular designation decision.\n\nFrum: So interesting. Yeah.\n\nKeisler: And there’s a default rule that says, I can change it. Now, there’d be limits there, right? He couldn’t just pick anybody to succeed Powell; he’d have to pick an existing governor because if there’s no vacancy, he can’t create one by firing a governor. He can only remove the chair, make the chair a governor, and elevate somebody. But eventually, there would be a vacancy. Or, you know, he could say to one of the governors that he wants to remove, How would you like to be secretary of the Treasury? Then fire his secretary of the treasury, move the governor to the Treasury Department, nominate somebody new, and say that person would be chair.\n\nSo there are ways to do this without putting himself in the weakest possible legal position. Because I think the Court would be as reluctant as the rest of us to usher in a situation where monetary policy is subject to presidential control on a day-to-day basis. And I think they would avoid a decision doing so if they if at all could.\n\nFrum: But he’s going to need a scapegoat because the tariff policy is an immediate disaster. There’s no public backing for it. And the Federal Reserve has always been—and when he got into trouble in 2018, the Federal Reserve was his favorite villain then. And Trump thinks like a lifelong debtor. He always thinks, There’s nothing wrong with this business that cheaper credit couldn’t fix. \n\nKeisler: Right. Look— at some point, he can’t keep on blaming Biden for everything that happens. So yes, he’s going to have to find other scapegoats. And maybe he will try to do this, and if he does, it will be yet another line being crossed that we may never be able to get back from.\n\nFrum: One of the things I think we’ve all discovered—I mean, we must have known it, but we never thought about it—there’s a background law to a lot of powers of the president, which is: The president of the United States would never do that. So we don’t have to write that down, because the president of the United States would never do that. So is there a law that the president of the United States can’t run a profit-making business while president? Or sell scam meme coins? Well, we don’t have to put that in writing, because the president would never do that. So the president did it. So now we have this strange spectacle, where there’s this powerful agency created—or it’s not even an agency. What do you call DOGE? What is its status?\n\nKeisler: It’s an entity.\n\nFrum: It’s an entity that’s firing people, cutting budgets, impounding funds. And all of this is overseen nominally by somebody who has never, I think, even been photographed, but in practice by a hugely powerful and wealthy businessman who has never divested himself from any of his other businesses. Now, are there legalities here, or are we in a post-legality world where legalities don’t matter anymore?\n\nKeisler: Well, there is a criminal conflict-of-interest statute, and it prohibits employees from participating in matters over which they have a financial or other interest that’s at all substantial. And that applies to Elon Musk because Elon Musk is what’s called a “special government employee,” meaning a temporary employee. But the conflict-of-interest laws apply to that.\n\nAnd look—in thinking about this, I mean, there’s obviously a host of really complex government regulations. But basically, the potential for conflict with anybody coming to the government is a function of the answer to two different questions. One is, what is their set of financial and other interests? And the other is, what are their responsibilities going to be?\n\nSo you have those two circles. And think of it like a simplified two-circle Venn diagram. Where those circles—his interests and his responsibilities—intersect, that’s the area where there is a potential conflict. And if you have very few assets, you can be secretary of the Treasury, but there’s not going to be much intersection. You can recuse yourself from a couple of things. If you have lots of assets, but you’re a data-input operator at the Social Security Administration, there’s not going to be a big intersection point.\n\nBut with Musk, what you’ve got is two really big circles because you have an enormous amount of financial holdings, and you have, government-wide, vague but very significant government-wide authority. So there’s a huge intersection point there. Now, you know, that doesn’t mean he can’t serve. There are lots of people who go into government with lots of financial interests, but there’s a process for that usually. You disclose all your financial interests to—you know, you were in the White House; you know this process. You disclose your financial interests to various lawyers and officials who go over it and then give you guidance as to what you can and can’t do. With Musk, what he said is, Oh, if I see anything that’s a conflict, I just won’t do that. So it’s completely self-policing. That’s not how it works. It’s at least not how it’s ever worked, and it’s not how it should work.\n\nFrum: But the president can dispense with a lot of, for example, the classification rules. Can the president say, Look—I know you’ve got a lot of SEC matters pending, but if you want to go ahead and fire everybody at the SEC so these matters won’t be resolved for the next hundred years, go ahead, be my guest. You have the power. Is that one of those, “But the president would never do that?” Or is there some law that would restrain the president’s ability to say, Yeah, you can gut the SEC so it will never get around to enforcing any of these matters against you?\n\nKeisler: Well, I have two answers to that. One is a technical one, and one is a philosophical one. The technical answer is: There is in the conflict-of-interest laws and regulations procedures for someone to get waivers from various agency officials, and usually the waiver requires you to show that your interest is just not so substantial that would affect the integrity of the procedure.\n\nNow, that almost certainly could not be sensibly granted here. But nonetheless, there could be a piece of paper where some agency official says, I grant you a waiver. I suspect they haven’t even bothered to do that. But I don’t know, because that’s where we get to the philosophical question here. And not to take this too high into the stratosphere, but the question is: What is law?\n\nLike, to me, law is a set of binding requirements that you find in statutes and court decisions and regulations in the Constitution. And they exist, and they bind whomever they bind by their own terms. But you know, there was a school of thought in the early 20th century—the legal realists, very influential thinkers who said, No, no, no, that’s silly. Law is not an abstraction. Law is a prediction about what courts and people who enforce the law are actually going to do, because that’s the only place where law has meaning.\n\nSo who enforces the conflict-of-interest requirement? It’s agency general counsels. It’s inspectors general. For high-level appointees like Musk, it’s the White House counsel’s office. And in extreme cases where there’s a criminal violation, it’s the Department of Justice. If all of those institutions have been sufficiently compromised, that there’s nobody who’s going to say, This is a conflict, is it really law? Well, we could debate that philosophically. As a practical matter, I don’t think anyone’s going to be applying the conflict-of-interest requirements to Elon Musk any more than Elon Musk wants them to.\n\nFrum: So it’s all gone?\n\nKeisler: I think like so much, you know, ultimately, look—we’re a democracy, and we give the president a lot of power. We particularly give the president a lot of power when he’s joined with Congress. The reality is that so much of what we rely on, as you say, have been norms and lines that presidents don’t cross, not because they couldn’t but because they don’t wish to. If they wish to, we’re in a different world.\n\nFrum: Well, this is where I want to invite you to look ahead to something that worries me a lot. And I don’t have any kind of answer to this, or I don’t even know how to begin to think about it.\n\nBut the United States has a strong tradition of turning the page on past chapters of political history. The outgoing president departs, and even if the successor thinks that outgoing president may have done some things that were wrong—there’s a very real-world example that during Watergate, it was uncovered that Lyndon Johnson had done many of the same financial things that Richard Nixon was accused of doing, and more so that would, in the post-Watergate world, look like violations of practice or even of law.\n\nStrong impulse: Turn the page. Don’t look back. Once Nixon left office, pardon and don’t look back. And so on, it has always been. And it becomes—it’s not just a technical matter of: Do we look at the acts of past presidents? But there’s also been a kind of acceptance of them. So enough time passes, and however much you didn’t like Ronald Reagan or Jimmy Carter, that 20 years after they’re out of office, everyone agrees to pretend they’re to be chiseled out of marble and regarded as stalwarts and paragons.\n\nOne of the things that Trump people complain about is, when Trump left office in 2021, he didn’t get that treatment, right? There were investigations that because his acts had been so egregious, that he was prosecuted in all kinds of ways, or at least investigated. He was able to stop most of the prosecutions. But he was treated in a different way from any other ex-president, to which the answer is: Well, he behaved in a different way.\n\nAnd as he’s now returned to the presidency, he’s doing even more egregious things. And the cycle—if and when there is a post-Trump presidency, if and when people who have different views ever reclaim any executive power, they’re going to confront either: These acts are so extreme; you can’t turn the practice of oblivion on them. But then we’re into a new kind of world that looks a lot more like French history than American history, where we’re digging up the bodies of dead kings and throwing them to the jackals.\n\nKeisler: Yeah, I mean, look—I would just say this, which is that I think that will be a tough question, but at the same time, at the end of this administration—let’s assume it’s just a four-year administration—the to-do list is going to be huge. It’s going to include things like: How do we rebuild NATO? And how do we rebuild our alliances around the world, and how do we rebuild our economy from the different shocks and disasters, and how do we rebuild a functioning civil service after so many people are fired?\n\nAnd I’m not saying that questions about accountability should be completely ignored, but I will just say that my priority is going to be less—and I think the new government’s priority is going to be less—How do we ensure accountability for past misdeeds? and more, like, How do we just repair the damage?\n\nFrum: But if some staffer at DOGE has unloaded vast amounts of proprietary government data into a computer where they shouldn’t be, and is maybe hoarding them or even trying to sell them, that person is going to have some kinds of legal liabilities in his own right. And the defense will be, Someone told me to do it.\n\nKeisler: No, that’s right. And look—you mentioned the Supreme Court’s decision about presidential immunity, with which I really disagree. The decision—I disagree with the decision. But at the end of the day, that only applies to the president. It doesn’t protect his subordinates. So there will be potential liability and exposure.\n\nAnd I don’t mean to dismiss that. I just feel like there’s going to be so much repair work to be done. I feel like we’re going to have other priorities as well.\n\nFrum: How does that rebuilding go? I mean, there is a practice where lawyers—no disrespect—tend to respond to breaches of norms by writing laws. And so after every scandal, you have this kind of museum of the scandal, which is the law written after the fact of: Outlaw the scandal, because it wasn’t maybe even illegal before, until you get ever greater accretions of law. And the bad practices, or the bad consequences of all this law, is you encourage the very American way of thinking, which is: If it’s not outright prohibited, then I’m free to do it.\n\nKeisler: Look—democracy got into this mess, and democracy is going to have to get us out. And that’s going to mean, kind of, fostering a public understanding of why these principles and norms are important, so that we could get back to a place where, regardless of whether it violates the precise terms of a law, people who want to be successful in politics and want to be remembered well won’t do that. And that’s a broader education and persuasion campaign more than it is a question of writing new laws and regulations.\n\nFrum: In Trump 1, just generally, the conservative legal establishment we knew, all the federal society people we were friends with—in so many cases still are—that was turned out to be quite a bulwark against the worst things the president wanted to do in Trump 1. During the interregnum between the two Trumps, it began to crumble. You found a lot of people who, one would’ve thought, knew better, making arguments to protect Trump that were obviously opportunistic for Trump, you know, one time only.\n\nAnd now in Trump 2, it’s not just legal weirdos from strange places in American life, but it is: A lot of very distinguished people are ready to do the work to enable Donald Trump to break what everybody used to think were laws. How do we think about this? What do we do about it? Does any of this cast a backward glance on the conservative legal project? Or is there a new conservative legal project that we’re going to need to do to incorporate kind of concepts of morality along with concepts of law?\n\nKeisler: Well, on the backwards-looking question, I mean, I certainly do look back and think, Well, you know, I thought there were people who shared certain principles that I hold dear, and that I thought we all said we held dear, that I guess turned out not to or changed their minds. So it does certainly make me look back with a bunch of question marks in my mind.\n\nBut look—looking forward in some ways, I think the answer is the same. Yes, there are a lot of people who have done things and joined things and advocated for things that I’m very surprised and disappointed about, and it certainly changed my view of them. But I think we need to work, person by person, throughout the country, just trying to persuade people that this is the wrong path, and moving to the right path anyone we can.\n\nFrum: Is there a general rule, or is it so particular in each case, where you could say to a young person who intended to do good and who’s thinking of serving the second Trump administration, Look—here are the rules where you might be able to do good, and here are the rules where you might not be? Or would your advice to them just be, Stay away. This is all going to end in ruin and disaster?\n\nKeisler: So my advice on that—it changed between the first Trump term and the second Trump term. In the first Trump term, I had a lot of conversations with people about that very subject. They would say, you know, I don’t like Donald Trump very much, but I have these particular political values which coincide with some aspects of his program, and my only chance to serve in the government would be in a Republican administration. What do you think I should do? And my general view there was that, look—the only alternative to good people being in government was more bad people being in government, and so that we all had an interest in having good people be in government.\n\nBut I would say, Look—that’s what the country’s interest is. For you, I would just look for roles that don’t have you directly, you know, with the Eye of Sauron gazing upon you in the White House. Find something that’s a little distant from that where most of the government is functioning normally, and you can engage in public service in a wonderful way.\n\nIn the second term, I just don’t think there is a part of the government where you can say that anymore. I think at this point, that baleful eye is kind of much more pervasive and trying to turn everything in its direction. I mean, one thing that is just striking about this administration, whether you talk about law firms or universities or the media: They are systematically trying to use every available lever of government power that exists in order to punish their enemies and discourage people from speaking out against them. And I think it’s very hard to find a corner of the government today where you can feel good. So I think on that my advice has changed.\n\nFrum: My very last question: You have had a distinguished career in private practice. You mentioned law firms just now. Why are the law firms buckling in the way that they are?\n\nKeisler: Well, I think it’s a classic prisoner’s dilemma, which is that some individual—I mean, the way the president’s attack on law firms works, again, this is about using all the levers of government power. They’re trying to ruin the law firms by threatening the clients—by saying, you know, You’ll lose your government contracts if you’re a client of this law firm, in the hope that the clients will flee, the lawyers representing those clients will flee, and the law firms will crumble. And so some law-firm leaders have, I think, mistakenly concluded that the way to do this is to cut a deal and just get themselves out of the president’s gaze, and then they can move on.\n\nI think they’re mistaken if they think they can move on. I think we’re already starting to see the demands escalate. Everybody knows that when you pay protection money, it’s not one and done—that they come back to you for more and more and more once they know you’re willing to pay. And so that’s why we see, even after these deals were inked, the president saying things like, Well, now I think I’d like to use these law firms to help coal companies with their leasing or help me with my trade deals. And there’s even reporting that they want these law firms to potentially work for DOGE and the Justice Department. Now, I don’t know whether any of those requests have been made. Maybe the president’s gaze will in fact turn elsewhere. But these law firms have indicated that they are willing to pay protection money, and I don’t know why they think it’s going to stop here.\n\nFrum: I think the message from the federal courts through Trump 1 and through the interval between Trump 1 and Trump 2 is, Don’t look to us. This isn’t our job. It’s your job. And maybe we all need to heed that message and say, You know what? They’re not—the courts aren’t going to save us. They can do some things, but this is our job. And we have to do it.\n\nKeisler: I think that is absolutely right. Look—courts are going to play a very critical function. They’re already playing that function. There’s a subset of issues where they are absolutely critical, and they’re often doing great work.\n\nBut that’s a subset of issues. Some things the president is doing are going to be terrible but lawful. Some things are going to be unlawful, but there’s going to be a long lag time between the act and a court remedy. And some things, the court remedy is just not going to be fully effective. So it’s ultimately up to the rest of us.\n\nFrum: Peter Keisler, thank you so much.\n\nKeisler: Thank you, David. It’s a pleasure.\n\nFrum: Thanks so much to Peter Keisler for joining The David Frum Show. I always learn so much from him. I have learned so much from him for so many years. I’m so grateful he joined us today.\n\nNow some questions from viewers and listeners. Let me thank everyone who’s been sending in these questions. We really are impressed by the volume and flow and the thoughtfulness of the questions. This week I was only able to select three. Please continue to send them. We’ll be selecting more in the future.\n\nBut let me begin with a question from John in Richmond, Virginia: “Why is it much more politically acceptable to attack Democratic constituencies, cities, and blue states, but not Republican constituencies, rural areas, and red states. Republicans compete to see who has more contempt for the former. And everyone seems to accept that Democratic voters should not expect to be treated as equal citizens under a Republican administration, but not the other way around.”\n\nWell, John, is it acceptable? I notice you don’t accept it. You know, a long time ago, President [Franklin] Roosevelt reprimanded one of his Cabinet members, the postmaster general, who was also the functional head of the Democratic Party. He had said something dismissive—the postmaster general—about Republicans in rural areas. And Roosevelt said to him, This is never wise. You don’t denigrate anybody. We need every vote and everywhere. And indeed, that year, President Roosevelt won the vote in Kansas and other midwestern states because he had practiced a politics of respect.\n\nRepublicans do this not because it’s acceptable, but because they’ve given up on competing in great parts of the country. And Democrats refrain from doing it because they continue to compete in great parts of the country. We have two political coalitions in the United States right now. One is the tightly bounded Republican coalition, with its strict upper limits and its lack of interest in competing in the areas of the country where probably more than half the population lives, and a much baggier, looser Democratic coalition.\n\nIt’s never good practice to insult anybody. You’ll always be surprised by votes that might be potentially available, and it’s just undisciplined and misbehavior for Republicans to do the opposite. It’s part of the self-indulgence, I think, that is intended to impel Republican politics in the Trump era. It’s not good for them. It’s not wise. And the lesson is not, Why can’t we be as obnoxious as them? but, When will they learn to stop being so obnoxious themselves? \n\nA second question comes from a reader who identifies himself as an immigrant from Africa. He said, “Sometime ago, you said in one of your interactions with other podcasts that you want to reclaim the term globalist, which the MAGA folks use as pejorative. How important do you think reclaiming such terms as globalist and globalization is in accepting the inevitable interconnectedness and interdependence economically, financially, commercially, of the global community in the 21st century and beyond?”\n\nYou know, when a word gets contaminated, there’s usually a strong reason why the people who contaminate the word want to contaminate it. And then those on the other side have to think very hard about whether it’s worthwhile to try to rescue the word or not.\n\nSo the word globalist is used to connect together a series of ideas, some very popular, some less so, and some quite crazy. So globalism is sometimes used to refer to advocacy for free trade, free movement of capital, investment goods—which, as we’re now discovering, most Americans support, and especially support when someone tries to take those things away. It can also mean a reference to the apparatus of global governance that makes this trade and makes these flows possible. These things don’t just happen by themselves. The United States and other advanced countries are bound together in a series of arrangements. The World Health Organization, conventions on postage and moving parcels, rules on intellectual property, all kinds of institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.\n\nNow, these institutions are harder to understand. They have many different missions; some are more popular, and others are not. And I think people who use the term global and globalist as pejoratives are trying to link something that is generally approved of—which is international trade—to things that people find more mysterious and maybe threatening, which are the institutions that make international trade possible.\n\nIt is also, I suppose, linked to feelings about immigration, which are more complicated than feelings about trade and goods and services and capital. And finally, I think it is intended to suggest at the back of all of these arrangements lies some shadowy conspiracy—maybe Jewish, maybe some other kind of conspiracy—that is manipulating the lives of people and controlling our thoughts, through 5G telephones or whatever paranoid conspiracy has the upper hand that week.\n\nI think the terms global and globalist are worth fighting for, because, as we’ve discovered, you can’t surrender part of this project and hope to keep the other parts alive. Once you accept the idea that there’s some kind of shadowy conspiracy that is making institutions work, you weaken the ability to defend international trade and other international benefits. The Trump administration has singled out for attack the World Health Organization. Now, it is only thanks to the World Health Organization, with its admittedly many, many problems, that we have any eyes into what is going on inside China at all. And China is a place where epidemics do tend to originate, for reasons that it’s fascinating to speculate about but ultimately don’t matter.\n\nThey just, again and again—epidemics going back into the middle years of the 20th century have tended to originate in China. So you want eyes and ears. The World Health Organization is a way to do it. If you denigrate that because you have succumbed to some crazy conspiracy theory, you do yourself no good. And if globalist and globalism are used as synonyms for anti-Jewish prejudice, then I think you need to take it head on.\n\nLast question comes from Jamie, California: “As someone deeply disturbed by what’s happening, I’m at a loss for what meaningful, immediate action I can take. Like many, I feel shocked by our country’s descent into autocracy and kleptocracy, but also paralyzed by it. What can individuals like me actually do right now that might truly move the needle instead of just waiting helplessly for the midterms?”\n\nYou know, there was a saying during the first Trump term: “LOL nothing matters.” And I always answered that by saying, actually, everything matters. It’s just that there’s a lot of everything. The needle is enormous, and its movements are often imperceptible to the individual eye. But that doesn’t mean that when you apply whatever force you have to moving that needle, however little you see the needle moving, that doesn’t mean it’s not moving. It is moving just so, so slowly and with such weight. And all our individual strengths are one by one, so limited, but together, so powerful.\n\nI am a great believer in elections over movements. There is a time and place when people need to come into the streets, and that is when the possibility of free and fair elections has been taken away. You see that happening in places like Serbia and soon, perhaps, in Hungary, where people come into the streets because the electoral process doesn’t work. And that day may come in the United States. I worry a lot about the integrity and fairness of the elections of 2026 and 2028. But for now, we have to assume and work on the assumption that those elections will be more or less free and fair, that the efforts that individuals put into organizing and voting will matter, and that is the place to go.\n\nYou shouldn’t be waiting helplessly for the elections; you should be preparing now. All those elections have begun. The 2028 election has begun. The 2026 elections have well begun. Money needs to be raised. Candidates need to be recruited. An organization needs to be done. If you live, as I infer Jamie does, in a state that is overwhelmingly blue, like California, you can still play a part by, for example, volunteering your time to phone bank into nearby states. California may be blue, but Nevada is contested. You can take time to help candidates in Nevada. And even in California, there are districts that can swing one way or another.\n\nAnother thing that a good citizen like Jamie can do is to try to make the Democratic Party more effective in government. You know, one of the things we all have to face is: A reason that Donald Trump came back to power in 2024 was because so many Americans were dissatisfied with the record of the Biden administration before it—both about things that maybe they couldn’t help, like the surge of global inflation, but the Biden administration also decided it wasn’t going to make a big deal out of issues like immigration enforcement, anti-crime enforcement, civic order. And that’s an important reason why Kamala Harris lost in 2024 and Trump was able to return.\n\nSo there has to be a Democratic Party that can not only win but govern if you’re going to keep the forces of Trumpism at bay, so being involved in those sectarian or factional disputes within the Democratic Party to say effective governance is going to be indispensable to keeping the lower-D democratic institutions in power, making them work, making them succeed.\n\nThere’s a lot to do. And you shouldn’t measure the success, the efficacy of your efforts by: Is there some immediate, big result? Everything moves so gradually. Everything moves so slowly, but everything does move.\n\nI think it’s the faith that individual effort can matter that brings me back here week after week. I hope it will bring you all back here week after week. Thank you all for watching. If you are watching on YouTube, please like and subscribe.

Not just independent in the way that most news programs are independent, but independent even from the rest of CBS News.\n\n While the vast majority of CBS News staff are stuffed into the CBS Broadcast Center on West 57th Street, 60 Minutes has long maintained a more traditional corporate office across the street, above BMW of Manhattan.\n\n That connective tissue has always been present in the stories 60 Minutes presented: Unafraid to take on the powerful, explore the unexplored, and occasionally to give a different perspective on a public figure people thought they knew. Segments could stretch into the hundreds of thousands of dollars in cost, unprecedented for a TV news program.\n\n And it has worked. 60 Minutes has been the number one news program on TV for years, routinely breaking into Nielsen’s top 10 list at a time when it seems like only sports break through.\n\n And over the years CBS has tried to bring the 60 Minutes secret sauce to other parts of the news division, betting that it could help elevate some of CBS News’ other shows, including in the mornings and evenings, where CBS’ offerings have languished over the years behind ABC and NBC.\n\n That included 60 Minutes‘ executive producer, Bill Owens, adding oversight of the CBS Evening News, with a goal of bringing some of the 60 Minutes ethos to the broadcast.\n\n Now Owens is out, telling 60 Minutes staff that “over the past months, it has also become clear that I would not be allowed to run the show as I have always run it. To make independent decisions based on what was right for 60 Minutes, right for the audience.”\n\n He told staff in a meeting “in a million years, the corporation didn’t know what was coming up, they trusted 60 Minutes to report the stories and program the broadcast the way 60 Minutes saw fit.” But that has changed in recent weeks. Susan Zirinsky, the former president of CBS News, returned to the network in an executive editor role earlier this year after a 60 Minutes segment about Israel was criticized as being “biased and one-sided” against Israel from the ADL.\n\n “While there is no way to cover such sensitive issues without provoking some degree of criticism, we have a responsibility to address those concerns,” Paramount co-CEO George Cheeks wrote when Zirinsky was hired. “This includes feedback regarding perceived bias in some CBS News coverage. We cannot let this negatively affect our legacy or our future, our mission or our connection to our viewers.”\n\n Zirinsky has reviewed some 60 Minutes segments ahead of broadcast, a source says, something that was not typical beforehand. Semafor also reported that Paramount controlling shareholder Shari Redstone requested a list of upcoming story topics, another unusual change.\n\n But its hard to look at the tumult at 60 Minutes without the larger considerations at play: Redstone has a deal to sell Paramount Global to Skydance, controlled by David Ellison, in a deal financed by his father, Oracle founder Larry Ellison.\n\n The FCC is still reviewing the deal, and has to sign off on transferring any broadcast licenses. The agency sets a 180 day calendar to review deals. The Skydance-Paramount deal is on day 159. At the same time, the FCC is also reviewing a “news distortion” complaint against CBS News over a 60 Minutes interview with Vice President Kamala Harris last year.\n\n In other words, the stakes are high, and the pressure is on, with a multi-billion dollar deal hanging in the balance. The FCC is believed to be seeking significant concessions from Skydance to secure approval, with an independent ombudsman, or an agreement to move staff or resources out of New York City and into cities where CBS has local stations among the possibilities.\n\n The question internally at CBS News is whether, after more than 56 years, 60 Minutes loses some of its long-held independence to secure the deal. Bill Owens was only the third EP in the show’s history. Now there will be a fourth. But what happens next could determine if 60 Minutes turns into jst another broadcast newsmagazine, or survives as the gold standard for the format.\n\n For corporate titans, news is often more trouble than it is worth. There is, as the former NBC anchor Chuck Todd told THR earlier this month, a “cultural problem” at play: “That, to me, is unfixable. Whether you’re at Disney, Warner Bros., Comcast, you name it. They’re moving into another space, and they don’t have time to incubate this.”\n\n The prize for Redstone is a multi-billion dollar payout, and the prize for Ellison is an entertainment empire. \n\n CBS News just one cog in that larger machine, and if it is gumming up a deal, there is a chance one side or the other looks for a way to grease things.\n\n Twenty one years ago, then-60 Minutes II correspondent Charlie Rose traveled to San Francisco Bay to interview Larry Ellison, who had poured more than $100 million into building a boat and a team to win the America’s Cup sailing competition.\n\n Rose explored what made Ellison tick in the segment, uncovering a competitive spirit: “I’m addicted to winning.

He said in a video announcing his retirement that he \"loves the job,\" but knows it's \"time to pass the torch.\"Many Democratic voters have called for longtime legislators to step down and give younger generations a chance to lead the party after Vice President Kamala Harris' loss in the last presidential election. Several other Democratic senators, such as Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire and Tina Smith of Minnesota, have thus far announced they're not running for reelection. Durbin, the party's number-two official in the upper chamber, is the highest-ranking Democrat yet to retire this cycle.Democrats shouldn't have much trouble holding the Illinois Senate race next year, as the state is solidly blue, having backed Harris by double digits last year due to the party's strength in Chicago and its suburbs. Whomever emerges from the primary would be an overwhelming favorite to hold the seat in the general and future elections.What to KnowA poll released earlier in April sheds light on how a Democratic primary could play out in Illinois after Durbin's retirement. Notably, none of the candidates polled have announced plans to run at this point but may do so in the near future now that Durbin, who was widely expected to retire, has officially made his announcement.A 314 Action Fund poll surveyed 773 likely Democratic primary voters from March 24 to March 27. It had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.53 percentage points and was first reported by Politico.The poll asked Illinois voters about who they would prefer between Representatives Robin Kelly, Raja Krishnamoorthi, Lauren Underwood and Lieutenant Governor Juliana Stratton—four Democrats who have been floated as potential Senate candidates.Underwood held a slight lead of 33 percent, with Krishnamoorthi closely following at 30 percent. Sixteen percent said they would vote for Stratton, while 10 percent backed Kelly. An additional 10 percent said they weren't sure how they'd vote.Former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel has been floated as a candidate as well. Axios reported in December that the Senate could be a \"landing spot\" as the former Obama chief of state and party power broker seeks to return to national politics.The Chicago Sun-Times reported that State Treasurer Michael Frerichs may also jump into the race.Representative Delia Ramirez, a more progressive Democrat, told NOTUS in January she had not ruled out a potential Senate bid.On the Republican side, Representative Darin LaHood also told NOTUS he would not \"close the door\" on a Senate run.\"I've had a lot of people encourage me to think about doing it,\" he told the publication.What People Are SayingDurbin told WBEZ on Wednesday: \"There are at least a dozen names that I think are serious. You've named a number of them. But there is a larger number who have approached me and said they might be interested in it.\"Lt Gov. Juliana Stratton, in a statement to X: \"For almost three decades, Dick Durbin has been a fierce champion for Illinois in the United States Senate. His leadership on healthcare, veterans issues, infrastructure, DACA, our judiciary system, and so much more will continue to leave a positive impact on our country for years to come.\"What Happens NextWith Durbin officially announcing his retirement on Wednesday, candidates could begin throwing their hats in the ring.Elections forecasters anticipate Democrats will hold the seat in November 2026. The Cook Political Report classifies the Illinois Senate race as solid Democrat, meaning it is \"not considered competitive\" and \"not likely to become closely contested.\"","summary":"Durbin's retirement could set off a crowded race to replace him in Illinois, a solidly Democratic state.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/dick-durbin-retirement-potential-candidates-illinois-senate-2063156","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2631890/illinois-senate-potential-candidates.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-23 16:31:03","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.123},{"id":314060304,"title":"Barabak: Is there a Republican governor in California's near future?","text":"The year was 2010. Donald Trump starred in Season 3 of \"The Celebrity Apprentice.\" Obamacare squeaked through Congress. Justin Bieber — with help from Ludacris — scored his breakout hit, \"Baby.\" And in California, Arnold Schwarzenegger was winding down his second and final term as governor. Three days into 2011, the Hollywood celebrity left office, marking the last time a Republican held Sacramento's top job. Could that change next year? Jumping into the gubernatorial race this week, conservative commentator Steve Hilton gave the GOP its second major candidate — alongside Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco — signaling a heightened sense of opportunity for a party that hasn't wielded significant power in the state Capitol since \"Avatar\" reigned at the box office. Not that a GOP takeover is likely. Only the most punch-drunk partisan would give Republicans as much as a 50-50 chance of succeeding Gavin Newsom. Some would say there's a greater likelihood of JD Vance being elected the next pope. Kevin Spillane, a Republican strategist who's not involved in the GOP contest, believes the party would \"need a lot of breaks\" to elect a governor in 2026. He put the odds at no better than 35% to 40% — though, as Spillane noted, that's \"still higher than we've had in a long time.\" What's buoying Republican prospects? \"It's homelessness,\" Spillane said. \"It's public safety. It's affordability. It's taxes. It's gas prices. It's energy policy. I mean, these are just bread-and-butter issues.\" If Kamala Harris decides to run, Spillane thinks that would only enhance the GOP's chances of seizing the governorship. \"You'll be able to tap into national Republican fundraising,\" he said. Small donors. Big contributors. \"There's obviously a lot of animosity on the Republican side toward her. She, along with Gavin Newsom, are sort of seen as symbols of California's multiple policy failures.\" But Garry South, a Democratic strategist who twice helped elect Gray Davis governor, is highly skeptical. \"No chance,\" he said of Hilton, Bianco or any other Republican assuming the governorship in January 2027. \"Zilch. Zero.\" South pointed to the state's political profile: Just 25% of registered voters are Republicans. Democrats make up 45% and most of those who are unaffiliated — just about another quarter of the electorate — tend to lean Democratic. \"The numbers don't add up,\" South said. \"Just get a calculator and do the math.\" He conceded that Democrats running for governor aren't campaigning in the best of times, or benefiting from a whole lot of goodwill. After nearly a decade and a half of one-party rule in Sacramento, there's no escaping responsibility for California's deep-seated problems. \"There's clearly unease about the homeless situation, which seems to be continually spiraling out of control. There's concern about crime,\" South said. \"But [voters] don't look at Republicans and see any potential solutions there.\" At least not since 2006, the last time the GOP won any statewide office. That said, stranger things have happened. Witness the convicted felon and twice-impeached scofflaw now occupying the White House. Matt Shupe is communications director for the California Republican Party, meaning his job is seeing that partisan hopes spring eternal. He said he doesn't have to crane his neck too hard to envision a viable GOP path to the governorship. While Republicans lag behind in voter registration, he noted that it's not unusual for candidates to win 40% or more of the statewide vote. In 2022, Lanhee Chen — one of the younger, more attractive Republican candidates of recent years — received nearly 45% of the vote in an unsuccessful bid for state controller. Given unhappiness with Sacramento's status quo, Shupe suggested, it's not impossible to see a Republican making up that last bit of ground and winning a majority. \"Things like gay marriage and abortion\" — which Democrats used for years as a bludgeon against Republicans — \"are enshrined in our state Constitution and aren't going anywhere,\" Shupe said. \"And assuming a Republican was elected governor, they still have the checks and balance of a majority or super-majority Democratic Legislature. \"So I think it opens people's willingness to vote Republican just to try something new, which is desperately needed.\" With Trump back in the White House and the economy on the skids, Democrats will surely brush off their familiar playbook and seek to turn the governor's race into a referendum on the unpopular president. (Important disclaimer: No one knows what kind of shape the economy will be in come November 2026.) Regardless, Shupe maintained those attacks will fall flat. The average California voter, he said, \"is tired of this war on Trump. That's not to say they're all MAGA-hat-wearing Trump supporters. But they want the state government to focus on infrastructure, homelessness, the cost of living and all these things that affect people every single day in their pocketbooks.\" Rob Stutzman, a Republican strategist who worked in Schwarzenegger's administration, is less optimistic than Shupe. \"That's not to say that Republicans can't become more competitive,\" Stutzman said, or improve their overall standing in California. A credible gubernatorial candidate could help the party by boosting turnout — potentially lifting up candidates for Congress and the statehouse — and laying the groundwork for a successful run at the governor's mansion sometime in the next decade. Asked the likelihood of a Republican winning in 2026, Stutzman offered about a 1% chance — \"for the same reason that a Democrat won't be the governor of [ruby-red] Idaho next year.\" Which — if you're looking on the Republican bright side — is not zero.","summary":"Steve Hilton and Chad Bianco give the GOP two of its most prominent candidates in years, signaling a heightened sense of opportunity for the party.

Walz, who was Kamala Harris’s running mate last year, is still the governor of a state that happens not to be Ohio—or West Virginia, Iowa, Wisconsin, Nebraska, or Texas, all of which he had visited recently.\n\nThis was a bit curious, especially because it is not a presidential-election year. His three-day tour of northeastern Ohio included labor roundtables, impromptu roadside stops, and two town-hall meetings. What was he up to exactly?\n\nLike Democrats in general, the two-term Minnesota governor is still trying to process the insanity of last summer and fall, the earthquake of Election Night 2024, and the horrors that have spiraled out since then. Also, like Democrats in general, he isn’t sure how best to counter the daily onslaught of the second Donald Trump administration. Walz seems to be figuring things out as he goes, but at the very least feels itchy to help jump-start the second Donald Trump resistance.\n\nWalz is a big breakfast guy. It gets him jump-started. He ordered his standard morning bowl of oatmeal with a sliced banana. Walz is also a big metaphor guy. For instance, he refers to his delirious vice-presidential campaign as his “90-day Eras Tour.” It is a good line, but an imperfect metaphor. Taylor Swift’s Era’s Tour reinforced her rolling dominance; Walz’s ended abruptly—and badly.\n\n“I own it,” Walz told me, referring to the inevitable critiques that have followed his and Harris’s defeat. He swigged from a bottle of Diet Mountain Dew, the first of four he consumes on an average day.\n\nI had a vague memory of Walz’s affinity for the phosphorescent soda. It was part of the populist persona that he debuted on the national stage after Joe Biden’s candidacy imploded in July, and that helped endear Walz to Harris. Walz, as her running mate, was that plainspoken lover of hunting, coacher of football, changer of air filters, wearer of camo. He was briefly the prototype hero for all of those “White Dudes for Kamala” (they had T-shirts!).\n\nI also had a vague memory of Walz briefly becoming a Democratic sensation last summer, even though that now feels like last century. But despite his star turn in July and August—the viral cable interviews, the killer convention speech—Walz virtually disappeared after Labor Day, except for a not-great debate performance against J. D. Vance.\n\nTo a certain degree, Walz’s recent travels represent a return to the national political scene. I was curious to see how he would be received. It’s not as if anyone senses a great public clamor for Tim Walz less than six months since Election Night. He seems a less than likely—and less than ideal—candidate to lead Democrats through their desperate straits. He often acknowledges this himself, as he did at a town hall in Youngstown.\n\n“Probably the last guy” who should be telling the party what to do, he said, “is the guy who got his ass kicked in the last election.”\n\nAudiences laugh at this, always. Political self-depreciation is a winner, especially in this period of abundant gallows humor.\n\nBut here is the notable part: A lot of people are showing up to see Tim Walz. The crowd at Youngstown’s DeYor Performing Arts Center was loud and boisterous—about 2,800 people, including a packed overflow room. They lined up on a snowy Monday, the same night as the NCAA men’s basketball title game. Walz drew another 2,000 people (with overflow room) to a large high-school auditorium in Lorain, Ohio, the next night.\n\n“Something is definitely happening,” Walz told me a few hours before the Youngstown town hall, during a stop for lunch across the border in Wheeling, West Virginia. By “something,” he meant a great and building frustration among people who are horrified not just by what Trump is doing but also by the lack of response from the putative leaders of the Democratic Party.\n\nNo one at these events seemed to view Walz per se as the Democrats’ savior, though I sensed nothing but goodwill for him. More than anything, he was a vehicle for them, someone to give voice to their anger. He had heard a “primal scream from America,” Walz said in Youngstown, the line that drew probably the loudest cheers of the night. “When people on the streets were saying, ‘My God, elected Democrats, do something!’”\n\nThere have been stirrings of late. “Cory Booker stood there for 25 hours,” Walz said in Youngstown, referring to the senator from New Jersey’s record-long floor speech the previous week. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York have embarked on a nationwide “Fighting Oligarchy” tour that is drawing crowds sometimes in the tens of thousands to places such as Missoula, Montana, and Nampa, Idaho. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts attracted a few thousand people at a recent rally in Austin and about 1,500 in Nashville. And Governor Gavin Newsom of California started a podcast last month; two of his first guests were staunch MAGA luminaries, Charlie Kirk and Steve Bannon. Another was Walz.\n\n“I’m kind of wondering where I fall on the list of guests,” Walz told Newsom after he was introduced. Walz praised his fellow governor for “doing something to try and fill a void that’s out there, and hopefully trying to use it as a platform to articulate our values to a broader audience.” He added, “We’ve not figured this out yet.”\n\nWalz talks a lot about this void. About a month ago, he set out to be part of the Democratic effort to fill it. He said he was appalled by the unwillingness of many Republican House members to hold town-hall meetings after agitated constituents started showing up to them. In March, Walz became one of a handful of Democrats who decided to host their own events in districts where Republicans had been refusing to. This would also be a chance for Walz to figure out a few things of his own, a version of the “where I fall on the list of guests” question. He wanted to see if there was any audience for someone like himself.\n\nWalz’s town halls are cathartic and fascinating spectacles—equal parts group therapy, strategy brainstorm, and gripe session. Walz is constantly spitting out fun facts and skips from topic to topic. He sometimes appears to be processing aloud as he speaks. One hobbyhorse is how Democrats need to communicate their message in simpler, real-life language. Walz affects a serious, highfalutin voice. “You hear Democrats say this, ‘We really need to address food insecurity,’” he said in Youngstown. “What we really need to do is make sure people aren’t hungry. And just talk about that.” (Oligarch is another bad term, Walz says, as opposed to greedy billionaires.)\n\nWalz is a good storyteller, and nails his applause lines. But he couches the current state of things as scary and getting more so. “The road to totalitarianism is people telling other people they’re overreacting,” Walz said in Youngstown. He throws around phrases such as “constitutional crisis” and “the world melting down around us.” He mentions that the White House is not far from jailing its political enemies.\n\nWalz offers the power of citizen engagement as the Democrats’ ultimate weapon. “One man should not be able to destroy the global economy,” he said in the crescendo of his speech in Youngstown. He said that Congress isn’t doing its job to check Trump, and now Trump is defying the courts. “So, I got to tell you,” he said, “this is what you call a constitutional crisis.” The crowd went nuts—presumably because they agree, not because they like constitutional crises.\n\n“But there is one final fail-safe. That’s the people,” Walz said. “The people,” he said again, over the building applause. “The people are going to solve this.”\n\nAbout that “running for something” question: Everything about Walz’s three days in Ohio resembled a well-advanced campaign trip. He had an entourage of about a dozen people, including security, traveling staff, local officials, and press; he does not have a political PAC, according to his staff, and he worked with local Democratic organizations to set up the events. He held big ones, smaller forums and meetings, media scrums, and meandering retail stops.\n\n“We’re going to eat fish sandwiches!” Walz announced upon his arrival at Coleman’s Fish Market, in downtown Wheeling. He greeted employees, visited a few tables, and posed for photos. Someone recommended that he try a cup of the alligator soup. It is one of the fish shop’s most popular items, even though alligators are not common in West Virginia—nor, for that matter, are they fish. Walz ordered some and immediately raved, in the way that politicians always rave about restaurant cuisine when cameras are present. “It’s like minestrone,” he said. “You gotta try it.” (I did, and found it bland and watery.)\n\nI sat at a wooden table across from Walz, who was joined by former Ohio Governor Ted Strickland. Walz started telling me about how a day earlier, while stopping at a convenience store, he’d met a woman who raises emus. I heard him tell this story several more times over the next day and a half. These goofy and serendipitous encounters are part of what Walz loves about campaigning, or whatever it is that he’s doing. He projects an obvious sense of missing being out on the trail, as if maybe he has his own void to fill.\n\n“So, are you going to run for president?” I asked Walz over breakfast the next morning at the Courtyard in Independence.\n\n“No, no,” he said.\n\nHe told me he will decide in a few months whether to seek a third term as governor; he is up for reelection next year. He briefly thought about running for an open Minnesota Senate seat in 2026 but decided not to. I tried the “running for president” question a few more times. He gave me more “no”s, but at a certain point they started coming with equivocations—or I heard them as such.\n\n“So, you’re not running for president?” I asked.\n\n“Ever? Possibly? Maybe? Rule it out? All that?”\n\n“My line always is: Don’t ever turn down a job you haven’t been offered,” Walz said, cryptically.\n\nWalz has obvious regrets and second-guesses about the last campaign. He agrees with those who wish that he and Harris had been less cautious. “I’m a big believer in flooding the zone,” he told me. The candidates should have gone on Joe Rogan’s podcast and talked with other Trump-friendly media outlets, he said. “I’m like, fuck it,” Walz said. “Just go.” If there is one lesson that Democrats can take from Trump, he said, it is to “continually be present.”\n\nAs far as his own role, Walz clearly felt restrained and, to some degree, reduced to a one-dimensional prototype for those coveted “White Dudes for Kamala” guys.\n\nHe is careful not to criticize the campaign directly, but not subtle in parroting the critiques of others. Walz volunteered that Bill Clinton had called him in early October. “He said, ‘Don’t allow them to make you a caricature.’” (The “them” here refers to Walz’s own campaign higher-ups, not the Trump-Vance campaign.) “You are a consequential governor,” Clinton told him, according to Walz. “And that’s what you should be running on.”\n\nI asked Walz if he’d ever pushed back against the campaign’s decisions. He said that he offered suggestions, but did not want to create problems. Yet he wishes he could have done more interviews, showed a less canned version of himself, and been more freewheeling.\n\n“Why didn’t they have me do this shit, like we did yesterday?” Walz wondered aloud, a bit wistfully, referring to his encounter with the emu lady, which he’d just excitedly finished talking about (again). “Solid, for 100 days, just that?”\n\nNear the end of our breakfast, Walz veered into another campaign story. He was doing a photo line at an event in California, and who should come roaring through but Katy Perry. “And for five minutes, she just chastised me about Diet Mountain Dew,” Walz said. “I was like, ‘You’re scaring me, Katy.’” Perry’s persistence didn’t work—Walz still guzzles the stuff with gusto—but at least this was another cherished vignette from the campaign trail that he seems to crave more of.\n\nAfter Walz finished his speech in Youngstown, he thanked everyone, waved, pointed, and lingered onstage. He had a big, almost euphoric smile on his face that went beyond the usual politician’s perma-grin. It felt at odds with the darkness of the Democrats’ predicament. He was relishing the moment.\n\nSo was the crowd. They lingered on their feet, cheering for the guy who got his ass kicked in the last election.","summary":"Back on the trail with the guy who lost the last election","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/04/tim-walz-campaign-democrats/682539/","image":"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/8ILptbt3x8lQrwMsaWOSznmQmmc=/0x1335:4856x3864/1200x625/media/img/mt/2025/04/A07A2256_KAISER/original.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-23 16:15:00","author":"Mark Leibovich","authors":["Mark Leibovich"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.031},{"id":314051894,"title":"CNN's Jake Tapper rips Paramount owner as CBS fights high-stakes legal battle with Trump","text":"CNN anchor Jake Tapper on Tuesday accused Shari Redstone, the controlling shareholder of CBS News parent company Paramount, of sacrificing the integrity of the outlet by likely settling a lawsuit President Donald Trump filed against the network.

As she read headline after headline about President Donald Trump’s tariffs and threats to turn Canada into the fifty-first state, the government employee and former journalist felt she had to take a stand. \n\n“What does this breakup mean?” McColl wrote to the municipal leaders of Skagway and Haines. “It means I won’t be visiting or spending money in your community while the leader of the United States continues with his hostile rhetoric.” She added, “I don’t want to punish individuals and small businesses, but right now, it’s more important for Canadians to make our voices heard.” \n\nWhile many Canadians are steering clear of the US, the tension between the two countries feels uniquely fraught in the Yukon. We share not just a border but also a sense of remoteness and a way of life. Road-tripping Alaskans travel through the Yukon to get to the Lower 48. In turn, Yukoners drive down to the coast for Haines’ annual beer festival and fishing derby, camping, hiking, and a taste of temperate winters. When Yukoners host friends and family, a trip to Skagway or Haines—or both—is often on the itinerary. The two coastal communities count on tourism, and Yukoners are typically more than happy to do their part.\n\nFirst Nations Are Rethinking Education in the Yukon. And It’s Working\n“Yukoners Are Pissed”: The Outcry over Telecom Failures\nThe Spectacular Fall of Victoria Gold, Once the Darling of Yukon Mining\n\nThe connection is also one of necessity; Skagway and Haines are both located just a few hours from Whitehorse and are only accessible by road via Canada. Their residents—a total of about 3,200 people—rely on the capital city for groceries, supplies, emergency medical care, and veterinary services. After Haines was hit with torrential rain, road washouts, and landslides that destroyed homes and killed two people in late 2020, the Yukon government donated $25,000 to the relief efforts. \n\nMcColl typically travels to Skagway and Haines every year. But now she’s urging other Yukoners to stop, knowing full well the toll that could take on small businesses. The point, in part, is leverage. She’s hoping the pressure will push those communities to demand something different from their government. “I don’t have anything against anyone personally, but I also want them to feel compelled to act on our behalf,” she says. \n\nCanada’s northern regions rely on imported goods, and US tariffs will make already expensive products like food, vehicles, and building materials even more so. Faced with an escalating trade war, the territorial premiers are making a pointed pivot: cutting out American goods, halting US liquor sales, and rewriting procurement policies to favour local suppliers.\n\nNot everyone, though, is ready to let the cross-border bond unravel. Haines Borough mayor Tom Morphet sent a “love letter,” as CBC put it, to his Whitehorse counterpart, Kirk Cameron. “We recognize that as northerners, we sometimes have as much in common with our Canadian neighbours as we do with our own countrymen in the southern latitudes,” he wrote. In response, Cameron encouraged him to join the Border Mayors Alliance, a group of more than thirty-five municipal leaders speaking out against Trump’s tariffs. (Morphet sent the same letter to the mayor of Haines Junction, a small Yukon community about two hours from the US border. According to Yukon News, he thanked the village for an ice rink resurfacer it had given Haines a few years ago in exchange for a load of salmon.) Then, in early April, Skagway residents hosted a Hands Off Canada rally, chanting for democracy as they carried Canadian and Yukon flags.\n\nAs Yukoners grapple with what to do about Alaska, the story of Jasmine Mooney, a Whitehorse-raised woman who was detained at the Mexico-US border by the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, left many of us aghast. Mooney was reapplying for her American work visa when she was, without explanation, locked in a cell for twelve days. It’s not just Yukoners who are feeling turned off—nationally, the number of people taking road trips into the US dropped by 32 percent in March compared to last year. American tour operators, according to the Globe and Mail, have reported booking declines of up to 85 percent. \n\nThere are others who consider Haines and Skagway an exception. Alaska is like the family next door, someone told me: while the dad is a jerk, we can still play with the kids. But pro-boycott Yukoners point to Alaska’s Republican leanings. The majority of Skagway voters, however, chose Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. Haines went red, but barely. \n\nEven as some Yukoners pull away, others are finding ways to preserve the ties that bind. Every summer, Yukoners and Alaskans celebrate their connection with the Kluane Chilkat International Bike Relay, a cross-border bicycle race along the highway from Haines Junction to Haines. This year, the relay’s board, made up of four Alaskans and two Yukoners, voted unanimously to proceed with the event as usual. “We’re not interested in taking a political stand to protest the States,” says Canadian treasurer Colin McCann. \n\nSome Yukoners have suggested the course change and turn riders, who usually number 1,200, around at the Canada-US border. That’s not possible with the race’s operating permit, McCann says. Ultimately, the board wants to let the people make their own decision.\n\nOne source of hope amid all the nervous looking-over-our-shoulders is that at the end of March, the Alaska House of Representatives passed a resolution condemning Trump’s tariffs and stressing the importance of the Canada-Alaska relationship. House majority leader Chuck Kopp—a Republican Trump voter—told Yukon News that he didn’t support the president’s threats to Canadian sovereignty. “Canada is our only neighbour,” he said. “It’s always been Canada first for Alaska.” Next, the resolution heads to the Senate.\n\nAmid the tension, about 100 people gathered in Whitehorse at the end of March to march for Canadian sovereignty. McColl and two friends decided to organize the non-partisan rally after hearing about a large gathering in Mexico City to stand in unity against Trump’s tariffs. (Similar events have been held recently in Toronto and Ottawa.) “This is just something that Canadians need right now,” McColl says. “We need to bolster each other.”\n\nOn Friday, April 25, join us online for The Walrus Talks at Home: Tariffs.

Dick Durbin will not seek re-election in 2026","text":"Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., announced Wednesday that he will not seek re-election in 2026, ending his decadeslong career in Congress. He is the Senate minority whip, the No. 2 position in the Democratic caucus, as well as ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. \"The decision of whether to run for re-election has not been easy. I truly love the job of being a United States Senator. But in my heart, I know it’s time to pass the torch,\" he said in a statement Wednesday and video posted to social media. \"So, I am announcing today that I will not be seeking re-election at the end of my term.\" Durbin, 80, is tied for the fifth-most senior member of the Senate, having been elected in 1996. Prior to that, Durbin represented Illinois in the House for 14 years. His decision to step aside leaves creates a vacancy that Illinois Democrats will likely scramble to fill in the deep-blue state, as it has a deep bench of federal and local lawmakers who might want to seek a promotion. A progressive group, 314 Action, recently released a hypothetical poll testing a possible Democratic primary field that included Reps. Lauren Underwood, Raja Krishnamoorthi and Robin Kelly, as well as Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton. The group, which supports candidates from science and technology backgrounds, has backed Underwood in the past. Adding to the uncertainty, Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker hasn't confirmed whether he plans to run for re-election as he continues to focus heavily on countering President Donald Trump. If he decides to leave the governor's mansion ahead of a possible presidential bid in 2028, it's possible that open seat could draw significant interest, too. Durbin's seat is expected to remain in Democratic hands, even though Trump made gains in the state in November. Then-Vice President Kamala Harris won Illinois by 11 percentage points, with 54% of the vote. Senate Democrats praised Durbin's congressional career. Durbin has been \"a pillar of leadership, integrity, and unwavering dedication to the people of his home state of Illinois and the nation,\" Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, a leadership member, said in a statement.","summary":"The second-ranking Senate Democrat will retire after a decades-long career representing Illinois in Congress.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/longtime-democratic-sen-dick-durbin-will-not-seek-re-election-2026-rcna201138","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/250414-dick-durbin-se-137p-62ede2.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-23 15:26:21","author":"Ben Kamisar,Bridget Bowman,Sahil Kapur","authors":["Ben Kamisar","Bridget Bowman","Sahil Kapur"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.291},{"id":314029854,"title":"Summits and talking shops on Reform are no substitute for governments changing lives","text":"John Swinney calling an anti-Reform summit to protect Scottish democracy was an obvious move for the First Minister.\n\nNigel Farage’s anti-immigration party is on the march across the UK and they look set to return a sizable number of MSPs next year.\n\nA Reform rabble at Holyrood would use their platform to punch down on the weakest in society and blame immigration for society’s ill.\n\nThey would be a constant source of nastiness and a visible sign our politics is headed down the wrong track.\n\nA more productive summit would have involved honest reflection and soul searching on why Reform are attracting record support.\n\nThe reality is mainstream parties and governments are to blame and show no sign of learning from their mistakes.\n\nTheir collective failure to improve people’s lives or address everyday problems has opened the door to Reform.\n\nWe are approaching the point where it is hard to remember the last time we had a government - UK or Scottish - that was a success.\n\nThe last fifteen years have been scarred by austerity, the trauma of Brexit, covid and the cost of living crisis.

His departure comes as the show faces attacks from President Donald Trump, who is suing CBS in a multibillion-dollar lawsuit. \n\nAt the heart of Trump’s case is his claim that 60 Minutes deceptively edited an interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris last year in a way that helped his then-opponent in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nDiscussing the drama at 60 Minutes on Tuesday, Tapper accused Shari Redstone—the owner of Paramount, CBS’ parent— of being “likely to bend the knee” to Trump and settle the lawsuit. Paramount is currently seeking a merger with Skydance Media, a deal which requires the approval of the Trump administration’s Federal Communications Commission.\n\n“The president alleges that editing the 60 Minutes interview and running two different answers to the same question helped Vice President Harris and amounted to electoral fraud,” Tapper explained. “In reality, this is just editorial discretion. Editors do it all the time with recorded interviews, including all the time with taped interviews by Fox [News].”\n\n“Now, Shari Redstone is the majority owner of Paramount, and she stands to make a fortune if this multibillion-dollar deal, this merger, goes through,” he added. “And it seems as if Shari Redstone is likely to bend the knee to Trump and settle this allegedly frivolous lawsuit.”\n\nTapper then read a comment from a 60 Minutes source, who told him: “The lawsuit was baseless. Owens wouldn’t apologize. He wouldn’t bend. He fought for the broadcast and for independent journalism, and that cost him his job. It’s shameful.”\n\nOwens joined CBS 37 years ago before being appointed executive producer of 60 Minutes in 2019. He was only the third person to assume the role in the show’s six-decade history.\n\nAnother source told Tapper: “Bill had widespread support at 60. He’s dedicated his life to CBS and the broadcast and this was his last act of dedication to it.”\n\n“It’s like a guy who has been battling for months against an attack, unable to defend the broadcast from inappropriate corporate influence,” the source added. “He pulls the pin from his last grenade. He sacrificed himself, hoping it might make our corporate overlords wake up and realize they risk destroying what makes 60 Minutes great.”\n\n“It seems clear now, in a quest to sell the company, Shari Redstone and others will bow to presidential pressure,” the source said. “60 Minutes is one of the crown jewels of American broadcast journalism, and they have no problem crushing it in their race to make a deal and make themselves richer.”\n\nTapper then cited some of Trump’s hostile actions towards the media, adding: “That is the context of Shari Redstone’s likely bending of the knee. Hope the money’s worth it, Shari.”\n\nThe CNN host noted that Redstone had no comment when contacted by his network.\n\nIn a memo to staff on Tuesday, Bill Owens wrote: “Over the past months, it has become clear that I would not be allowed to run the show as I have always run it, to make independent decisions based on what was right for ’60 Minutes,’ right for the audience,” according to The Washington Post.\n\n“So, having defended this show—and what we stand for—from every angle, over time with everything I could, I am stepping aside so the show can move forward,” Owens added.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to CBS for comment.","summary":"Jemal Countess / Getty Images for The AtlanticCNN’s Jake Tapper tore into the owner of CBS’ parent company following the sudden departure of longtime 60 Minutes producer Bill Owens.\n\nOwens stepped down on Tuesday after 24 years on the show, telling staff that he was no longer able to make “independent decisions” and could no longer run the show as he had previously.

CBS denies the claim, but the Federal Communications Commission—now stacked with hand-picked Trump allies—is investigating the network, an unprecedented move with potentially massive implications for media freedom.\n\nTrump’s attacks on CBS go well beyond the lawsuit. Earlier this month, he erupted on his Truth Social site after “60 Minutes” aired two segments he didn’t like—one with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and another about Trump’s bizarre obsession with buying Greenland. During the rant, Trump called for CBS to be stripped of its broadcast license.\n\nBehind the scenes, that pressure seems to be shaping decisions at the network. CBS parent company Paramount and its controlling shareholder have reportedly pushed for a settlement, fearing the lawsuit could derail a multibillion-dollar merger with Skydance Media—a deal that will need clearance from Trump administration regulators. Staffers are furious, with some warning that surrendering to Trump would effectively gut the network’s credibility.\n\nAnd CBS isn’t alone. The Washington Post has tacked right under billionaire ownerJeff Bezos, earning Trump’s praise but costing the outlet subscribers and talent. Then there’s the Los Angeles Times, where owner Patrick Soon-Shiong reportedly told the editorial board in December to “take a break” from writing about the president, even as he wreaks havoc on the federal government. The fallout cost the paper several of its most prominent reporters and editorial writers.\n\nTrump has also targeted other networks in court. ABC News settled a defamation suit in December and agreed to pay $15 million to the president’s future presidential library—a move that blindsided journalists there. \n\nCBS seems to be following the same conciliatory path. According to The New York Times, settlement talks with Trump are underway, and a mediator has already been appointed. \n\nRelated | New FCC chair eagerly carries out Trump’s war on the press\n\nOwens’ resignation may be the clearest sign yet that even flagship news programs aren’t immune from Trump’s grip on the press. His exit is especially striking: a CBS lifer, Owens first joined the network as a summer intern in 1988 and became just the third executive producer in “60 Minutes” history when he took the reins in 2019.\n\nAnd this isn’t happening in a vacuum. Earlier this month, Trump backed an appeal to a judge’s order forcing the White House to reinstate the Associated Press’ credentials after the outlet was punished for refusing to call the Gulf of Mexico the “Gulf of America.”\n\nIn a message to staff, CBS News and Stations CEO Wendy McMahon said she was “committed to ‘60 Minutes’ and to ensuring that the mission and the work remain our priority.”\n\nBut Owens’ abrupt departure sends a different message: Trump’s pressure campaign is working. More and more outlets are caving to the aspiring autocrat—and if that trend continues, all that’s left will be a MAGA-friendly right-wing echo chamber.","summary":"The top producer of legendary news show “60 Minutes” abruptly quit on Tuesday, suggesting that CBS News has surrendered to President Donald Trump and abandoned journalistic freedom.\n\n\n\nExecutive producer Bill Owens wrote a memo to his staff saying it’s “become clear I would not be allowed to run the show” without interference or “make independent decisions based on what’s right for ‘60 Minutes,’ what’s right for the audience.”\n\n\n\n“Having defended this show—and what we stand for—from every angle, over time with everything I could, I am stepping aside so the show can move forward,” he wrote.\n\n\n\n\nBill Owens was only the third executive producer in the storied CBS news show's 57-year run.\n\n\nOwens’ exit comes as Trump wages a $10 billion lawsuit against “60 Minutes” over its campaign-trail interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris, accusing the show of editing the segment to make her look good.

As part of her rounds, the Republican lawmaker appeared in Anchorage before an annual meeting of tribal leaders and nonprofit executives.\n\nInevitably, the discussion turned to the wrecking-ball presidency of Donald Trump and his autocratic and, frankly, un-American penchant for siccing the government on his political foes.\n\nAsked what she had to say to those living in fear, or who represent constituents afraid of today’s McCarthyesque climate, Murkowski responded with honesty and bracing candor.\n\n“We are all afraid,” she said.\n\nShe then paused five long seconds, her face a rictus of wonderment and concern, allowing the observation and admission — from a sitting member of the United States Senate, no less — to sink in.\n\n“It’s quite a statement,” Murkowski went on.\n\nStartling silence\n\nAnother brief pause, then several starts and stops.\n\n“But we’re in a time and a place where … I’ve not been here before,” she said. “And I’ll tell you, I’m oftentimes very anxious myself about using my voice, because retaliation is real. And that’s not right.”\n\nIt’s a fine pass we’ve come to when simply speaking the truth and stating the obvious are considered newsworthy, much less an act of courage. But here we are, folks.\n\nAmerica, 2025.\n\nIf you wish to be cynical, there are reasons why Murkowski — whose comments Monday quickly ricocheted across the country — may be more prepared to speak out against Trump than her timorous Republican peers.\n\nTrump easily carried Alaska all three times he ran for president. But his showing — the 54% of the vote he received in November was a high mark — is a shadow of his blowout victories elsewhere. Trump won Wyoming with 70% of the vote, West Virginia with 68% and Oklahoma and North Dakota with 65% support.\n\nHis executive order changing the name of North America’s tallest peak, Denali, back to Mt. McKinley has landed among Alaskans with a decided thud. A survey of adult residents found they opposed the switch by more than 2 to 1.\n\nIn other words, the Last Frontier is not exactly head over heels for Trump. Besides, Murkowski won’t face reelection — should she decide to run for a fifth term — until 2028, when Trump’s time in office will finally, mercifully be winding down.\n\nThose factors, however, don’t take away from the starch in the senator’s spine or her willingness to stand up while so many others in her party cower in submission.\n\nGive Murkowski her due: She doesn’t shrink from a fight.\n\nIn 2010, she notched a rare write-in victory after losing the GOP nomination to a right-wing “tea party” Republican. In 2021, Murkowski was one of just seven Republican senators — and the only one to face constituents in the next election cycle — to vote to convict Trump in an impeachment trial for inciting the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.\n\nHer act drew a censure from state GOP leaders and the petulance you would expect from Trump, who urged some Republican, any Republican — “If you have a pulse, I’m with you!” — to challenge Murkowski’s reelection. When Kelly Tshibaka, a 2020 election denier, stepped forward, Trump appeared at an Anchorage rally to lend his support. Murkowski won anyway.\n\nShe may be the state’s most popular living politician, said Amy Lovecraft, a political science professor at the University of Alaska in Fairbanks. “She knows the state,” Lovecraft said. “She gets stuff done. She’s a doer.”\n\nShe’s also outspokenly independent, a rare commodity in today’s increasing cult-like GOP. In fact, the whole notion of checks and balances — a foundational principle of American democracy — has gone out the window, Murkowski suggested in Anchorage. “Right now, we are not balancing as the Congress,” she said, expressing concern, as well, over Trump’s attempted undermining of the judiciary.\n\nRare dissenter\n\nMurkowski has taken on Trump more than once.\n\nShe refused to vote for him in 2024 — she didn’t support Kamala Harris, either — and was one of the few Republicans in office to publicly condemn Trump’s shameful pardon of the Jan. 6 insurrectionists. She opposed Pete Hegseth’s risible nomination as Defense secretary and voted to undo Trump’s heedless tariffs on Canada. She’s also expressed concerns about Elon Musk’s wanton assault on federal employees.\n\n“Things are happening so fast through this Department of Government Efficiency, DOGE” — the fictive name of Musk’s made-up agency — “None of us understand the half of it. It’s literally piecing it together,” Murkowski told those gathered in Anchorage.\n\nSpeaking on Monday to the Anchorage Daily News, Murkowski recounted conversations with some of those summarily fired in Musk’s precipitous purge. Many were in tears.\n\n“They thought that they were in a profession they’ve given so much to and thought that they were doing well,” Murkowski said. “And literally, with no notice whatsoever, [they were] terminated and told that their work performance was not satisfactory, which was not true.\n\n“These are real emotions. These are real people,” she said. “These are real fears and they need to be heard.”\n\nSadly, for now, Murkowski is one of vanishingly few Republican politicians with the guts to speak up against the party’s rogue president — a brave, but lonely, voice in the wilderness.\n\nMark Z.

the year before he became the Pope - Bergoglio stood out strongly against the government of Cristina Fernandez in Argentina.\n\nHe said that his country was suffering from demagoguery, corruption and efforts to establish authoritarian rule.\n\nBergoglio was chosen as Pope Benedict's successor on March 14, 2013.\n\nThe German pontiff's shock resignation the previous month triggered the first conclave since 2005, following the death of John Paul II.\n\nCardinals took five rounds of voting to settle on the first Latin American pope in history.\n\nThey appeared to have struggled to choose between maintaining a non-Italian papacy or to return to its traditional roots.\n\nFrancis then appeared in his papal robes on the balcony of St Peter's Basilica to address thousands of jubilant Catholics who were packed into the square below.\n\nThe photograph of the new Pope surrounded by some of the cardinals who elected him inspired author Robert Harris to write his 2016 bestselling papal thriller Conclave.\n\nFrancis became the first pope from outside Europe in 1,300 years when he was chosen to replace the retiring Pope Benedict XVI.\n\nFrancis, who was born Jorge Mario Bergoglio in Buenos Aires, will be remembered for his comparatively liberal attitudes on some subjects that made him both popular and controversial.\n\nHe expressed tolerance towards divorcees, allowed priests to bless same-sex couples under certain circumstances, and put concern for the environment at the heart of his papacy.\n\nJorge Mario Bergoglio as a teenager in Buenos Aires, and right as a younger child with his brother Oscar (on the right)\n\nJorge Mario Bergoglio pictured front row left dressed as a waiter in a school theatre production\n\nAnd he said in 2023 that transgender people could be baptised as long as it did not cause a scandal or 'confusion'.\n\nBut he did stand firm on the subject of abortion. In a text signed by Francis that was released by the Vatican last year, terminations were described as 'an extremely dangerous crisis of the moral sense'.\n\nFrancis's health was considered more fragile because of the fact that he had to have part of one of his lungs removed when he was 21 after developing pleurisy.\n\nBergoglio was born on December 17, 1936. He was one of five children of an Italian immigrant railway worker and his wife.\n\nSpeaking in Italian in his first address to the crowd in St Peter's Square, Francis said: 'Let's pray for one another, for the whole world, so that there is great fraternity.'\n\nHe led the crowd in prayer for Benedict - now known as Pope Emeritus - and led the faithful in reciting the Lord's Prayer.\n\nSoon after he became the Pope, allegations that Francis had failed to openly confront Argentina's murderous military dictatorship resurfaced.\n\nLike most Argentines, Bergoglio did not publicly confront the junta, which ruled from 1976 until 1983.\n\nCritics claimed he did little to help those who disappeared during the dictatorship. Thousands of people were never seen again.\n\nPope Francis stood on the main balcony of St. Peter's basilica during the Urbi et Orbi message and blessing to the city and the world as part of Easter celebrations, at St Peter's square in the Vatican on April 20, 2025\n\nQueen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip meet the Pope at the Vatican, April 2014\n\nHuman rights lawyer Myriam Bregman accused Francis of allowing his own Jesuit priests to be rounded up and tortured by the junta death squads.\n\nWhen what was known as the 'Dirty War' began in 1972, church leaders were alleged to have known what was happening, but chose to back the regime of Juan Peron and then the military junta.\n\nThousands of babies of mothers murdered as enemies of the regime and then adopted by families approved by the military dictatorship.\n\nIn October 2012, the bishops of Argentina - led by Francis - published an apology which acknowledged that the church had not protected its faithful.\n\nThey also appealed for information about where bodies had been buried and for stolen babies to come forward.\n\nBut the apology did not stop Bergoglio's critics from slamming his refusal to give evidence in court on the events of the 1970s until 2010, when his answers were considered by some to be evasive.\n\nHe was also accused of failing to prevent the torture of two of his own Jesuit priests.\n\nHowever, supporters of the Pope insisted that he did take risks behind the scenes, including visiting the home of dictator Jorge Videla to appeal for mercy.\n\nFrancis weathered the criticism and proved to be a busy Pope.\n\nHis first foreign visit was, fittingly, to South America. His seven-day visit to Brazil was followed by a trip to the Middle East the following year.\n\nIn Israel, he visited the al-Aqsa Mosque and then prayed at the Western Wall in Jerusalem's Old City.\n\nOther visits included trips to Cuba and the United States in 2015, Dublin in 2018 and to Iraq in 2021.\n\nJD Vance (pictured left) tried to mend his rocky relationship with Pope Francis (pictured right) at the Vatican on Easter Sunday after the leader of the Catholic church slammed the Trump administration's treatment of illegal migrants\n\nOn several occasions, Francis directly addressed the painful subject of sexual abuse in the Catholic Church.\n\nIn 2018, he told abusers to turn themselves in and to 'prepare for divine justice'.\n\nThe following year, he admitted for the first time that priests and bishops sexually abused nuns in the past.\n\nCases of abused nuns had been reported in India, Africa, Europe and South America.\n\nHe told reporters: 'Should we do something more? Yes. Is there the will? Yes. But it's a path that we have already begun.'\n\nIn 2020, Francis vowed to 'uproot the evil of child abuse' after a damning report into the Vatican's handling of allegations against US cardinal Theodore McCarrick were published.\n\nAnd in September 2024, during a visit to Belgium at the end of a hugely busy month, Francis told a crowd of 30,000 people in Brussels: 'Evil must not be hidden. Evil must be brought out into the open.'\n\nHis speech came after he held a meeting with 17 abuse survivors the day before.\n\nFrancis's 12-day tour across south-east Asia and Oceania earlier in September proved to be his last major overseas visit.\n\nIn Dili, the capital of tiny Southeast Asian country Timor-Leste, some 600,000 people gathered in a field to see Francis oversee one of the biggest masses of his papacy.\n\nThe last leg of his tour was in Singapore. There, he criticised both Donald Trump and the then presidential hopeful's political rival Kamala Harris - as both campaigned ahead of the American election.\n\nHe described them as 'one who discards migrants and one who kills children' in a rare voicing of his political views.\n\nThe Pope previously warned US voters they would need to cast their ballots 'according to their conscience' and decide who is 'the lesser evil'.\n\nIn early February this year, just days into Mr Trump's second presidency after his election victory last November, Francis criticised the new administration's mass deportation of migrants.\n\nHe warned in a letter to US bishops that the program to forcefully deport people purely because of their illegal status deprives them of their dignity and 'will end badly.'\n\nPope Francis's history of health problems\n\nLUNG AND RESPIRATORY TRACT\n\nWhen he was 21, the then Jorge Bergoglio developed pleurisy and had part of one of his lungs removed in Argentina.\n\nHe suffered repeated influenza and related problems since the start of 2023.\n\nHe cancelled his appointments on September 23, 2024, because of what the Vatican described as light flu symptoms. \n\nIn February last year, he had a check-up in hospital after suffering from flu and returned to the Vatican promptly the same day. \n\nIn late November 2023, he was forced to cancel a planned trip to the COP28 climate meeting in Dubai because of the effects of influenza and lung inflammation. \n\nIn March 2023, the Pope was taken to hospital after complaining that he had difficulty breathing. He recovered swiftly after receiving antibiotics for bronchitis.\n\nThe Pope suffered two falls recently in his residence, bruising his chin in December 2024 and injuring his arm in January 2025.\n\nCOLON AND ABDOMEN \n\nThe Pope spent nine days in hospital in June 2023 when he had surgery to repair an abdominal hernia.\n\nHis medical team had decided that surgery was required because the condition was causing painful intestinal occlusions.\n\nIn July 2021, the Pope had 13 inches (33 cm) of his colon removed in a six-hour operation that was aimed at addressing a painful bowel condition called diverticulitis. \n\nHe said in 2023 that the condition had returned. In an interview with Reuters in 2022, he dismissed as 'court gossip' rumours that cancer had been found during the 2021 surgery. \n\nThe surgeon who operated on him has since confirmed that there was no cancer.\n\nBACK AND KNEE\n\nThe Pope also suffered from sciatica, a chronic nerve condition that causes back, hip and leg pain. \n\nA flare-up of the ailment caused the pope to miss New Year's Eve and New Year's Day services in December 2020, the first time health problems had caused him to miss major religious events.\n\nHe also developed a separate, painful knee problem, but told Reuters in July 2022 he opted against surgery because he did not want a repeat of long-term negative side effects from anaesthesia that he suffered from the 2021 colon operation. \n\nInstead, he has looked to overcome the problem with laser and magnet therapy.\n\nIn 2022, he was forced to cancel trips to Lebanon, Democratic Republic of Congo and South Sudan because of his walking problems. \n\nHe rescheduled the Africa trip and went to both countries in 2023. \n\nIn his final years, the Pope used a wheelchair or a cane and his waistline noticeably increased due to a more sedentary lifestyle in the Vatican.\n\nMENTAL HEALTH\n\nPope Francis said in 2021 he saw a psychiatrist in his native Argentina when he was a young priest who helped him deal with anxiety during the time of the military dictatorship. \n\nHe said he had learnt to deal with the problem through various mechanisms, including listening to the music of Johann Sebastian Bach. \n\nPope FrancisBuenos Aires\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nPeople are only just discovering the very unexpected job Pope Francis had before becoming head of Catholic Church\n\nAdd comment","summary":"People are shocked after learning the bizarre job Pope Francis had before becoming the head of Catholic Church.

Had less than 1 percent of voters in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan changed their vote to Kamala Harris, she would have won 270-268.Despite Joe Biden earning 7 million more votes than Trump in 2020, a change of 20,000 votes in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Arizona would have resulted in an Electoral College tie–which Trump likely would have won in a contingent election. The resulting post-election campaign witnessed Trump pressuring state legislatures to choose their own electors, an \"alternate elector\" scheme, and Trump's lobbying of Mike Pence to reject electoral votes. We find these shenanigans have left lingering effects upon many voters and have sewed additional distrust in the Electoral College process.The Electoral College is a frequent target of criticism—with more attempts to amend or abolish it than any other feature in the Constitution. Few polls ask citizens their thoughts about the Electoral College beyond one's preference for a popular vote instead of the current process. Our poll of Ohio voters suggests there is likely much more concern among large majorities of citizens about potential hijinks than is often thought.We find a majority of respondents (54 percent) would prefer a national popular vote over the Electoral College. Just about a third (35 percent) prefer the current Electoral College system. This is consistent with national findings from the fall where 58 percent favored a national popular vote and 39 percent favored the Electoral College. Perhaps unsurprisingly, we see a major partisan difference with 81 percent of Democrats preferring a national popular vote with just 34 percent of Republicans preferring so.Misfire elections where a candidate wins the Electoral College vote but loses the popular vote have occurred in more than 10 percent of all presidential elections including Donald Trump's victory in 2016 and George W. Bush's victory in 2000.Our respondents were concerned with the possibility of misfire elections by a 2-1 margin (62 percent to 33 percent). Had Harris squeaked out victories in the three states we mentioned above, we imagine the desire to move away from the Electoral College would be immense.When it comes to other structural issues with the Electoral College, we find majorities are concerned that less populated states have too much power (53 percent to 38 percent) and that candidates focus too much on swing states (54 percent to 38 percent) because of the Electoral College. These concerns exist because of the Electoral College process and will continue to be a source of concern as long as it remains.We find especially strong concerns over highly unlikely scenarios that are owed to the events surrounding the 2020 election and its aftermath. Interestingly, these worries cross party lines with members of both tribes expressing unease that they could happen.Nearly three-quarters (73 percent) of respondents say they were concerned that a state legislature could overturn their state's popular vote for president. This translates to 86 percent of Democrats, 72 percent of Independents, and 62 percent of Republicans. Overtures by the Trump campaign were made to state legislators to consider doing this after the November 2020 election.Seven in 10 respondents stated that they were concerned that Congress could overturn the results of the November election when they meet to count electoral votes on January 6 after the election. This anxiety is undoubtedly triggered by the events of January 6, 2021. A large majority of Democrats (80 percent), Republicans (64 percent), and Independents (69 percent) share a common concern over such an unlikely event occurring. In an attempt to prevent another January 6, Congress passed the Electoral Count Reform Act of 2022 to make it harder to challenge electoral votes and have them discounted during the joint session of Congress.Lastly, 62 percent of respondents are worried about the potential for so-called faithless electors who do not vote for the candidates to which they are pledged. In 2016, a record number of faithless votes were cast. In 2020, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments as to whether states could prohibit faithless electors and ultimately, they decided that they can. As a result, many states have passed laws prohibiting faithless votes, making their appearance less likely.While most arguments over the Electoral College focus on whether or not we should select our presidents by a national vote, it appears that most citizens are concerned with various manipulations of the Electoral College process under certain conditions. The stress tests we have seen in recent presidential elections have made these concerns much more salient and the potential for several of them—such as another misfire election—will persist under the status quo.Robert Alexander is a professor of political science at Bowling Green State University.

Fretting Liberals capitalised on the opening by ditching Trudeau and electing a new leader, former banker Mark Carney as a “serious” antidote to Trump.\n\nWith election day on the horizon, Liberal fortunes have made a stunning volte-face. Once trailing far behind like a wounded racehorse limping to the finish line, the party has edged slightly ahead.\n\nBut Carney and cocksure company should remember that other old chestnut that, beyond taxes, there are no guarantees in life or politics.\n\nSome polls reveal a tightening contest, with one having Conservatives retaking the lead.\n\nAnd while the subject dominating the short campaign has been the existential danger that a former continental confederate poses to Canada’s sovereignty, for many concerned Canadians, the state-sponsored genocide devouring Palestine and Palestinians with such ruthless and inhumane efficiency is the defining issue of these awful times.\n\nThose same concerned and motivated Canadians have made it plain that genocide is on the ballot and Canada’s established political parties are obliged to take note, or they will suffer the inevitable and harsh consequences.\n\nLast week in Ottawa, scores of Canadians demonstrated their resolve to hold Canada’s political leaders to stiff account if they continue to deny that Israel is guilty of genocide and refuse to put tangible pressure on Tel Aviv to end the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians in Gaza and the occupied West Bank.\n\n“We are here in Ottawa,” a concerned Canadian said, “to demand a two-way arms embargo … and to say to all politicians that if you do not endorse a two-way arms embargo, you will not get a single vote from any of our communities.”\n\nThat concerned Canadian is, of course, not alone.\n\nThey have been joined by thousands of like-minded Canadians who have invested time, money and energy to mobilise Arab and Muslim voters throughout Canada to exercise their agency and franchise on April 28 in solidarity with their besieged brothers and sisters in Palestine.\n\nLarge nationwide and energised grassroots movements, including #ElectPalestine, MuslimsVote and Vote Palestine, are seized with the overarching imperative to fix the fate of Palestine and Palestinians at the epicentre of Canada’s political dialogue.\n\nTheir “voices” must finally be heard and attended to.\n\nThe predictable cultural condescension – quick, election-time visits to mosques and cliche-ridden rhetoric meant to convey tissue-thin “sympathy” for the “sad” plight of Palestinians – has lost what remained of its vacuous currency.\n\nInstead, powerful constituencies are demanding that Canada’s “major” political parties recalibrate fundamentally and unequivocally their longstanding backing for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu – an indicted war criminal – and reject outright his oft-repeated, and international law-desecrating aim to reduce Palestine to dust and memory.\n\nThe crusade gathering momentum in Canada is reminiscent of the “Uncommitted” cause engineered by Arab and Muslim citizens during the 2024 US presidential election, who warned the Democratic Party and its standard bearer, Kamala Harris, that they risked losing votes in crucial swing states by continuing to arm and offer diplomatic cover to Netanyahu.\n\nHarris failed to heed the urgent alarm and, as a result, forfeited the presidency to mollify Israel, its evangelical supporters in the United States and Netanyahu’s grotesque strategic aims.\n\nHer reward?\n\nAn emboldened Netanyahu has embraced Trump like a brother-in-genocidal-arms.\n\nThe Democratic Party may or may not have learned an instructive lesson that may or may not influence its slavish Israel-coddling in 2028.\n\nWe will, in due course, see.\n\nMeanwhile, Carney and Poilievre have been busy mimicking Harris’s scoffing at the pressing preoccupations of Arab and Muslim voters and their allies among the broader Canadian public.\n\nPoilievre is a crude, irredeemable honorary Zionist zealot, describing mass pro-Palestinian protests as “hate marches”.\n\nFor his cavalier part, Carney was confronted at a rally in Ontario earlier this month by a concerned Canadian who asked the prime minister, “Why are you sending weapons to Israel via the US to kill our families?”\n\nCarney’s response: silence.\n\nThe prime minister and his handlers ought to know that Arab and Muslim Canadians will play a decisive role in the election outcome and could determine whether or not the new parliament features a majority government.\n\nArab and Muslim voters make up a sizeable part of the electorate in 90 ridings – electoral districts – across Canada, and, of that figure, could tip the scales in more than 40 seats.\n\nAs a career-long numbers man, Carney surely understands that dismissing or alienating that many Canadians, in that many ridings, only invites disappointment and possible peril.\n\nA recent public opinion poll commissioned by the National Council of Canadian Muslims (NCCM) offers Carney a template for how he can win over Canadians who intend to vote with Gaza and the West Bank top of their minds and souls.\n\nMore than half of Canadians support a ban on weapons exports to Israel. Even more tellingly, almost 50 percent want that ban expanded into a full-blown, two-way embargo.\n\nThese are not trivial findings. They represent a clear, growing consensus among Canadians who are tired of moral evasions from their leaders.\n\nSo far, Carney has been content to hedge and adopt Canada’s so-called “balanced” approach. But hedging will no longer suffice; nor will calculated complicity.\n\nMuslim and Arab voters have watched in despair as Canada’s political elites, through their silence and inaction, subscribed to the humanitarian catastrophe being waged against innocents in the shattered remnants of Palestine.\n\nToday, 56 percent of Canadians say that Canada should recognise the International Criminal Court’s (ICC) arrest warrants for Netanyahu and former Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant – and 70 percent of Liberal voters agree.\n\nCarney needs to do much more than endorse the loophole-laden arms embargo that Foreign Minister Melanie Joly announced in March.\n\nIf he is serious about justice, Carney has to support a two-way ban, stand with and by the ICC, and insist that Canada will not be a haven for alleged war criminals.\n\nAnything less, and Carney will have treated Arab and Muslim Canadians with the signature disdain of his predecessors – even when the polling, for once, is squarely on their side.\n\nCarney still has time to do the right thing, at the right moment, for the right reasons.\n\nI suspect that the prime minister will squander the opportunity. Mark Carney is bound, like Kamala Harris, to pay a lasting and stinging price.","summary":"If Mark Carney wants to win, he must not repeat Kamala Harris’s fatal mistake on Gaza.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/4/23/in-canada-genocide-is-on-the-ballot?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2024-03-15T224139Z_1958609542_RC2MM6ANAORR_RTRMADP_3_CANADA-POLITICS-1712343970.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-23 10:40:19","author":"Andrew Mitrovica,Apps Support","authors":["Andrew Mitrovica","Apps Support"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.232},{"id":313945350,"title":"Four years on, Trump is still focused on his 2020 loss","text":"Most politicians never forget the races they lost. But perhaps no elected official has ever been as fixated on an electoral defeat as President Donald Trump.\n\nDespite successfully recapturing the White House last November, Mr. Trump has continued to circle back with regularity to the 2020 election, which he still insists was stolen from him. In remarks as well as presidential actions, he appears intent on reshaping the official narrative surrounding his four-year-old loss – even as new evidence continues to reinforce the reality of that defeat. \n\nMr. Trump frequently frames the presidency of Joe Biden as illegitimate. The war in Ukraine “would never have happened if the 2020 Election had not been RIGGED, in other words, if I were President,” he wrote on Truth Social on April 13. He has made similar claims about the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel. \n\nAs president, Mr. Trump has pushed out members of the Justice Department who investigated his efforts to overturn Mr. Biden’s victory, which culminated in the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. His administration reportedly vetted appointees specifically on their views of who won the 2020 election. One of his first official acts as president was to pardon hundreds of people convicted of federal crimes related to the Jan. 6 rioting, which resulted in the loss of lives among both protesters and police, and injuries to more than 140 law enforcement officers. \n\nParallel to his actions looking back to 2020, Mr. Trump has also sought to dictate how states run elections, asserting power to enforce federal laws in a sweeping executive order that includes provisions on mail-in ballots, proof of citizenship, and the certification of voting machines. Conspiracy theories about machines flipping votes to Mr. Biden featured prominently in Mr. Trump’s rearguard efforts in 2020 to stay in power. Multiple states are challenging the executive order in court. \n\nWhile it is not clear whether it all stems from a deep insecurity, an effort to elevate his legacy, or a larger political strategy to wield greater power over future elections, Mr. Trump’s preoccupation with 2020 appears to be driving significant presidential actions and policies in ways that could have real implications for U.S. democracy.\n\n“It’s a grievances politics that’s at the center of his worldview,” says Nicole Hemmer, a historian at Vanderbilt University who directs the Rogers Center for the American Presidency. “It’s about throwing into question the outcome of elections and damaging people’s trust in that outcome.” \n\nVetting appointees on their views of the 2020 election is a particularly chilling assertion of presidential power, says Professor Hemmer. “It’s not a test of whether you believe the election was stolen. It’s whether you are willing to say the election was stolen.”\n\nIn polls, a majority of Republican voters continue to say they believe the 2020 election was fraudulent, echoing Mr. Trump’s claims. Yet multiple judicial challenges, state audits, and defamation lawsuits related to fraud claims have come and gone without providing any basis for doubt about the outcome. \n\nMr. Trump’s rhetoric has already had a corrosive effect on democracy, says David Becker, who heads the Center for Election Innovation & Research, a nonprofit that works with election officials. In the wake of misinformation spread about 2020, unprecedented levels of abuse and threats have occurred against the state and local officials who oversee elections. “Public servants – Democrats and Republicans – have been hounded because of these lies,” he says. \n\nHe adds, “It’s unfortunate we have a losing candidate that won’t accept his loss.” \n\nDefamation verdicts rebutting claims of fraud\n\nOne arena where Mr. Trump’s claims of a stolen election have been repeatedly punctured is in defamation cases. A series of lawsuits brought by Dominion Voting Systems against right-wing media outlets have highlighted the falsehoods told by Mr. Trump’s allies on air about the company, which manufactures electronic voting machines, scanning devices, and software. \n\nSome Trump allies have faced their own defamation suits. Rudy Giuliani, Mr. Trump’s former lawyer, was found liable for defaming two Georgia election workers in connection with the 2020 election and ordered to pay a $148 million judgment. Kari Lake, who unsuccessfully ran for governor of Arizona in 2022, settled for an undisclosed amount last year with Stephen Richer, a GOP county recorder whom she had falsely accused of rigging her defeat. \n\nIn both cases, neither defendant contested the evidence presented in court, instead moving to the damages phase. Their acceptance of liability is telling, says Mr. Becker, a former civil rights attorney at the Department of Justice. “The truth is an absolute defense in defamation,” he says. \n\nThe latest defamation ruling came on April 9, when a judge in Delaware found that Newsmax had broadcast multiple false claims about Dominion. A jury is due to decide on potential damages later this month. In 2023, Fox News paid $787 million to settle with Dominion after a similar finding. Analysts say Newsmax, whose owner, Chris Ruddy, is a confidant of Mr. Trump, may also settle out of court with Dominion to avoid a jury trial. \n\nOn the same day as the Newsmax verdict, Mr. Trump ordered an investigation of Chris Krebs, his former director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. He had fired Mr. Krebs in November 2020 after the director said there was no evidence of computer fraud in the presidential election. His agency had called the election “the most secure in American history,” infuriating the embattled president. \n\nMr. Trump also signed an executive order to end federal contracting with a Houston-based law firm that represented Dominion in its defamation lawsuits against media organizations. Susman Godfrey, the latest law firm to be targeted, has since won an injunction from a federal judge temporarily blocking the order, which the judge called “a shocking abuse of power.” \n\nMr. Trump “promised retribution, and that’s what’s going on,” says Jane Kirtley, a professor of media ethics and law at the University of Minnesota. “He’s very thin-skinned, and he has a very long memory.” \n\nThe executive action against Mr. Krebs is notable for naming an individual rather than an institution such as a law firm or university. It revokes security clearances held by Mr. Krebs, who is now a cybersecurity consultant. And it calls him “a significant bad-faith actor who weaponized and abused his Government authority,” claiming that he censored conservative viewpoints. \n\nWhile signing the document, Mr. Trump claimed falsely that “more and more fraud” had been discovered about the 2020 election. “So, we’ll find out whether or not it was a safe election, and if it wasn’t, he’s got a big price to pay, and he’s a bad guy,” he said, referring to Mr. Krebs. \n\nThis “illegitimate use” of presidential power is deeply troubling, says Professor Hemmer. “The 2020 loyalty test is one you have to pass to be part of the administration. Now we’re seeing the flip side,” she says. “You will be singled out and punished” for dissent.\n\nOfficial actions around voting\n\nMr. Trump’s March 25 executive order on “protecting the integrity” of elections doesn’t refer explicitly to 2020, but it justifies its actions as necessary to prevent fraud. It would require those who register to vote to prove their citizenship, impose stricter deadlines for mail-in ballots, and empower federal agencies to review state voter lists. Several lawsuits have been filed against it by states and left-leaning groups. Some conservatives have also criticized it as federal overreach that flouts states’ constitutional rights to run elections. \n\n“Elections may have national consequences but the power to conduct them rests in state capitols. No public mandate, real or perceived, lets Washington tamper with this authority, not even for a worthy cause like election integrity,” wrote former Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in an opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal earlier this month. \n\nCongress has also taken up the issue of citizenship and voter registrations. The House recently passed the SAVE Act, which imposes new mandates that Republicans argue are needed to prevent noncitizens from voting. It’s already illegal for noncitizens to vote in federal elections, and instances appear to be very rare. Many Democrats say proof-of-citizenship requirements would disenfranchise legitimate voters who don’t have ready access to documents such as birth certificates. \n\nMr. Trump has repeatedly claimed without evidence that Democrats are getting votes from immigrants who are in the country illegally. After he won the Electoral College but lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton in 2016, he set up a commission to investigate such alleged illegal voting. The commission disbanded after failing to turn up proof to support Mr. Trump’s claims. In the 2024 campaign, Mr. Trump and his allies made further claims without evidence, including that that Democrats had “imported” millions of migrants into swing states to vote for his opponent, Kamala Harris. \n\nPolling shows that a majority of Americans support anti-fraud measures such as voter ID and citizenship checks, says Matt Germer, who heads the governance policy program at the R Street Institute, a think tank in Washington that favors limited government and free markets. But he’s concerned that “fearmongering” by Mr. Trump is undermining public faith in the ballot box. “Our elections are trustworthy,” he says. \n\nIronically, the push from Republicans for stricter rules on voter registration may cut against their own partisan interests. While Democrats may once have benefited from making it easier to cast a ballot, that’s now at odds with the coalition assembled by Mr. Trump, which includes many irregular voters who only turn out when he is on the ballot. \n\n“Republicans are now becoming the party of late-deciding, low-propensity voters who may not be showing up to the polling stations with all their documentation,” says Mr. Germer.","summary":"Even as ongoing defamation lawsuits find no evidence of a fraudulent election, President Donald Trump keeps insisting that the 2020 vote was rigged.

Trump is seeking $20 billion in a lawsuit against CBS, alleging election interference over its handling of a \"60 Minutes\" interview last year with then-Vice President Kamala Harris. The president accused CBS of aiding his 2024 Democratic opponent through deceptive editing just weeks before the presidential election. CBS’ parent company, Paramount Global, agreed to mediation, signaling their courtroom feud will result in a settlement. On Tuesday, Owens announced to colleagues he's removing himself from the newsroom drama. \"Over the past months, it has also become clear that I would not be allowed to run the show as I have always run it. To make independent decisions based on what was right for 60 Minutes, right for the audience,\" Owens wrote in a memo obtained by Fox News Digital. \"So, having defended this show – and what we stand for – from every angle, over time with everything I could, I am stepping aside so the show can move forward.\" \"The show is too important to the country, it has to continue, just not with me as the Executive Producer,\" he said. TOP '60 MINUTES' PRODUCER RESIGNS FROM SHOW, CITES LACK OF INDEPENDENCE Trump attorney Ed Paltzik told Fox News Digital, \"CBS and Paramount committed the worst kind of election interference and fraud in the closing days of the most important presidential election in history. That the 60 Minutes boss resigned the same week as CBS settled a major discrimination claim is even further proof of their reckless disregard for truth and the law. President Trump will pursue this vital matter to its just and rightful conclusion.\" That settlement involved a lawsuit brought by a script coordinator who alleged he was passed over for a writing job on the CBS program \"SEAL Team\" because of the network's DEI policies. NewsBusters executive editor Tim Graham, a conservative media watchdog, was baffled that Owens cited journalistic independence as the reason he was walking away. \"They often describe their work as ‘independent’ when another definition would be ‘tremendously biased.’ Anyone currently watching '60 Minutes' would wonder how anyone could claim they're not allowed to 'independently' go after Trump with a hammer and tongs,\" Graham told Fox News Digital. Graham believes the true reason for Owens’ departure is related to Trump's legal battle against CBS. The lawsuit stems from an exchange Harris had with \"60 Minutes\" correspondent Bill Whitaker, who asked her why Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wasn't \"listening\" to the Biden administration. Harris was widely mocked for the \"word salad\" answer that aired in a preview clip of the interview on \"Face the Nation.\" However, when Whitaker asked the same question during the primetime special, Harris had a different, more concise response. Critics at the time accused CBS News of editing Harris' \"word salad\" answer to shield the then-vice president from further backlash leading up to Election Day. Earlier this year, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chair Brendan Carr ordered CBS News to hand over the unedited transcript of the interview as part of its investigation into whether the network violated the FCC's \"news distortion\" policy after a complaint was filed. CBS had refused to release the unedited transcript when the controversy first began. The released raw transcript and footage showed that both sets of Harris' comments came from the same response, but CBS News had aired only the first half of her response in the \"Face the Nation\" preview clip and aired the second half during the primetime special. TRUMP, CBS PARENT COMPANY SET FOR MEDIATION IN $20 BILLION ‘60 MINUTES’ LAWSUIT Trump's attorneys amended the lawsuit to include multiple excerpts from the unedited transcript in hopes of bolstering their case that CBS News withheld unflattering exchanges in order to help the Democratic nominee. Owens reportedly told staffers he was not willing to apologize, but Shari Redstone, Paramount’s controlling shareholder, is reportedly in favor of settling with the president. Many believe Paramount Global is hoping to settle the suit ahead of a planned merger with Skydance Media in hopes of preventing potential retribution by Trump's FCC, which has the authority to halt the multibillion-dollar transaction. Leading up to Owens' exit, Redstone reportedly \"kept tabs\" on which upcoming \"60 Minutes\" segments were about Trump. While a spokesperson for Redstone told Semafor neither she nor Paramount sought to kill stories, one source told Semafor that Redstone had been privately and publicly critical of \"60 Minutes\" in recent months. \"It seems like the people making this show every week are responding to Trump's lawsuit by doubling down on anti-Trump fervor,\" Graham said. \"But we can guess these self-appointed white knights on their high horses are upset with executives who might negotiate in any way with Team Trump,\" Graham continued. \"Owens refuses to apologize for CBS's lack of professionalism, and maybe someone would prefer that he does to get a settlement done. So, he quits.\" FAIR ELECTION FUND URGES FCC TO HOLD CBS ACCOUNTABLE FOR 'UNLAWFUL CONDUCT’ RELATED TO ’60 MINUTES’ INTERVIEW Owens expressed concern about a recent uptick in oversight from CBS executives during an internal meeting on Tuesday when informing staffers of his abrupt exit, according to The New York Times. DePauw University journalism professor Jeffrey McCall said Owens is \"falling on his sword for losing his journalistic independence,\" but feels corporate overlords have been looming over the news industry for years. \"A key question is whether the execs at CBS were trying to micromanage Owens or just trying to provide corporate vision to the program,\" McCall told Fox News Digital.
