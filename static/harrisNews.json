Tom Tiffany and allied groups are raking in campaign cash to propel his bid of becoming his state’s next governor.\n\nTiffany has raised $2 million since entering the critical swing state’s gubernatorial contest in September, his campaign exclusively told the Daily Caller News Foundation. The Wisconsin College Republicans, a pro-Tiffany group pledging to help elect him in November, has also raised $1 million this cycle. (RELATED: Clear GOP Frontrunner Emerges For Wide Open Governor Race, Polling Shows)\n\nTiffany, 68, who represents a vast swath of northwestern Wisconsin, is viewed as the clear frontrunner in the state’s Aug. 11 Republican primary.\n\nTiffany’s campaign did not disclose a cash on hand number ahead of the state’s Jan. 15 filing deadline. Donations came from all 72 counties in the state, according to a campaign official.\n\nThe candidate is touting his fundraising numbers as mostly grassroots and said his campaign is focused on improving education and affordability in the Badger State.\n\n“While Democrats rely on Hollywood donors and coastal elites, we are building a movement powered by the People of Wisconsin that is focused on better schools, lower taxes and restoring affordability after seven years of failure under Governor [Tony] Evers and Wisconsin Democrats,” Tiffany said in a statement. “[I] look forward to sharing a vision that reverses declining education outcomes, lowers electricity rates and property taxes and ensures Wisconsinites from young families to seniors on fixed incomes can afford to call Wisconsin home.”\n\nTiffany holds a commanding lead over Republican candidate Josh Schoemann, Washington County’s executive, ahead of the August 2026 primary, according to a Marquette University poll released in late October. The survey found 23% of GOP primary voters support Tiffany, followed by Schoemann at 6%, though roughly 70% of respondents were undecided.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has yet to publicly back a candidate in the race. An August survey from Republican firm Fabrizio, Lee & Associates, first reported by the DCNF, found that a Trump endorsement would widen Tiffany’s lead over the rest of the primary field.\n\nTrump narrowly defeated former Vice President Kamala Harris in the Badger State by roughly 30,000 votes in 2024. Wisconsin was the closest state of the presidential contest by percentage margin.\n\nTiffany boasts support from major Wisconsin law enforcement groups, including the Milwaukee Police Association and the Kenosha Professional Police Association Board of Directors. Every Wisconsin GOP member of Congress is backing his campaign.\n\nHe is also courting young conservatives in his bid to succeed Democratic Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers, who announced in July he would not seek a third term. Tiffany was the first candidate Wisconsin College Republicans endorsed in the 2026 cycle. Tiffany also spoke at Turning Point USA’s AmericaFest in December.\n\n“After the horrific assassination of Charlie Kirk, a fire was lit inside every one of us. It reminded us that the future of Wisconsin is in our hands, and we refuse to sit on the sidelines,” Wisconsin College Republicans Chair Nicholas Jacobs said in a statement. “We are prepared to work night and day to take Wisconsin back to the top.”\n\nFormer Democratic Wisconsin Lieutenant Governor Mandela Barnes launched a bid for the open seat in December. Barnes narrowly failed to unseat Republican Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson in 2022 during which he faced scrutiny for previously supporting defunding the police, abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and ending cash bail.\n\nDemocratic Wisconsin Lt. Gov. Sara Rodriguez and Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley are also vying for the Democratic nomination among other lesser-known candidates.\n\nTiffany first won election to the House in 2020 and is a member of the conservative Republican Study Committee.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Three gunshots – fired point-blank in the gelid snows of Minneapolis by a federal immigration officer at Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old white woman and American citizen – have plunged the North Star State into renewed political turmoil. The fatal shooting took place only a few blocks from where George Floyd was killed in May 2020.\n\nIn responding to the tragedy, President Trump proceeded on his favourite premise – the best defence is a good offence. On social media, he declared that the need for the imposition of law and order by immigration and customs enforcement (ICE) was paramount: \n\nThe woman driving the car was very disorderly, obstructing and resisting, who then violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer, who seems to have shot her in self-defense.\n\nHomeland Defense Secretary Kristi Noem averred that the ICE agent had previously been the victim of an attempted car attack several months ago. The most subdued official was Trump’s border tsar, Tom Homan, who on CBS News called on lawmakers to ‘let the investigation play out’. As it happens, the official report on the US Customs and Border Patrol’s website indicates that ‘officers should be prohibited from shooting at vehicles unless vehicle occupants are attempting to use deadly force – other than the vehicle – against the agent.’\n\nTrump’s chief antagonist is, of course, Minnesota governor Tim Walz, the former running mate of Kamala Harris, whom he regards with particular contempt. This past Sunday, for example, the president disseminated a conspiracy theory video that falsley claimed that Walz was the moving spirit behind the assassination of Minnesota lawmaker Melissa Hortman and her husband in June last year. \n\nWalz, who recently announced that he would not seek a third term in the wake of allegations of widespread social service fraud in the state, has fired back with martial language. A day ago, he declared, ‘I don’t think any governor in history has had to fight a war against the federal government every single day.’ On Wednesday night, he asked Americans to ‘stand with us against this’, called ICE a ‘modern-day Gestapo’, and stated that he was prepared to call out the National Guard to quell any local protests that might turn violent.\n\nMinnesota Democrats are calling upon Trump to withdraw the 2,000 ICE agents that he has sent swarming into the state. But Trump is unlikely to relent. The days of ‘Trump always chickens out’ appear to be over, at least until he experiences a real setback.\n\nThe truth is that Trump is riding high. He’s invaded Venezuela. He seized a Russian-flagged tanker. He’s openly musing about seizing Greenland. He’s vowing to raise the Pentagon’s budget to $1.5 trillion (£1.1 trillion) to create a ‘dream military’. He’s given the go-ahead for passage of a draconian Russia sanctions bill in the Senate, to the delight of Senator Lindsey Graham. And he’s just terminated all food assistance to the government of Somalia.\n\nSo why would the President back down in Minnesota or other blue states? Trump reckons that he can shore up the support of Maga-world by targeting the tens of thousands of immigrants from Somalia residing in Minnesota whom he has previously dismissed as ‘garbage’. Trump doesn’t do Minnesota nice.","url":"https://spectator.com/article/trump-wont-back-down-after-the-minnesota-shooting/","image":"https://spectator.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2255142413-e1767877264666.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-08 13:08:02","author":"Jacob Heilbrunn","authors":["Jacob Heilbrunn"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.187},{"id":391986212,"title":"Pro-Life Groups Push Back on Trump's Abortion Funding Suggestion: 'No Hyde, No Deal'","text":"President Trump encouraged fellow Republicans to do what many consider the unthinkable – allow taxpayer dollars to fund abortions. He said it might be necessary to strike a new health care deal.\n\nThe health care stalemate led to the longest government shutdown in history late last year. \n\n Another failure to reach an agreement could force another shutdown. In current negotiations, Democrats insist Republicans give up the Hyde Amendment, which for the last nearly 50 years has prohibited federal tax dollars from being used to pay for most abortions. \n\nIn a surprising move Tuesday, President Trump said it might be necessary to get his health care package, which involves overhauling the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, by giving government money directly to plan participants, rather than to the insurance companies.\n\n\"Let the money go directly to the people,\" President Trump said, \"Now you have to be a little flexible on Hyde. You know that. You got to be a little flexible. You got to work something. You got to use ingenuity. You got to work. We're all big fans of everything, but you got to be flexible. You have to have flexibility.\"\n\nThe comments are a stark reversal for the president. Just days after being sworn-in to his second term, he signed an executive order calling for greater enforcement of the Hyde Amendment.\n\nKristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America, told CBN News there should be no flexibility on the prohibition of federal taxpayer dollars being used to pay for abortions.\n\n\"Just one year ago, we were honored to see President Trump shoring up, calling for Hyde protections, she said, \"He needs to go back to a year and review his remarks.\"\n\nHawkins said the Hyde Amendment signals a red line for most pro-life advocates.\n\n\"Since 1976, the first time we saw Hyde attached to a congressional spending resolution, it has been estimated from researchers that over two million children have been saved,\" she said, \"They've been spared the death by abortion.\"\n\nKelsey Pritchard, Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America's communications director told CBN News a Republican forfeiture of the Hyde Amendment will hurt them in the upcoming midterm elections.\n\n\"Republican officials cannot win their races in November if they abandon their pro-life base,\" she said. \"Had one to two percent of pro- life voters stayed home in 2024, Trump would not be president right now. We would have Kamala Harris in the White House.\"\n\nWhile failing to negotiate a health care deal could mean another government shutdown, some lawmakers would prefer that to relinquishing Hyde.\n\n\"I think we've seen really great leadership from Speaker Mike Johnson, from leader John Thune in saying ,\"No Hyde, no deal,\" essentially all throughout this process,\" Pritchard said, \"And so we're hopeful that the GOP will hold strong and not compromise on Hyde.\"\n\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to receive the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.","url":"https://cbn.com/news/health/pro-life-groups-push-back-trumps-abortion-funding-suggestion-no-hyde-no-deal","image":"/sites/default/files/media/slider/images/ljo1274trumphyde_hdv.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-08 12:45:57","author":"Lorie Johnson","authors":["Lorie Johnson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.234},{"id":391977632,"title":"Trump freeze on billions of child care funding becomes political cudgel for Democrats on affordability","text":"All five states will see $7.35 billion cuts to the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families program, a freeze on $2.4 billion to the Child Care and Development Fund, and $869 million to the Social Services Block Grant Program.\n\nBut in a midterm year when Democrats are itching to regain control of at least one, if not both, branches of Congress, the Trump administration risks Democrats seizing on attacking the White House for making daily life unaffordable for the average family.\n\nAlthough the cuts are in Democratic states, California and New York will feature several swing races that will determine control of the House as the GOP hopes to maintain or improve on its slim majority. \n\nTRUMP TO CUT $10 BILLION IN CHILD CARE FUNDING FOR FIVE BLUE STATES\n\n“It’s obviously going to be easy fodder for Democrats to say, ‘OK, you talked a big game about being pro-family, wanting more babies, why are you holding these programs hostage?’ And I frankly suspect that this will not persist that long,” Patrick T. Brown, fellow at the conservative Ethics and Public Policy Center, said. “It’s a very aggressive maneuver to kind of get attention and send the shock waves to the system.”\n\nDemocrats have excoriated the freeze as “downright shameful: Trump is ripping away child care and resources from states that didn’t vote for him,” according to Sen. John Hickenlooper (D-CO).\n\nGov. Kathy Hochul (D-NY) claimed the White House was aiming to “make life harder and more expensive for children and families,” while Rep. Sara Jacobs (D-CA) wrote on X that “I don’t ever want to hear any ‘pro-family’ bull**** from this Administration ever again. Cutting off $10 billion for child care in CA and 4 other blue states will make kids, parents, families, and providers suffer. This is disgusting political retribution.”\n\nKaivan Shroff, a 2024 delegate for former Vice President Kamala Harris, told the Washington Examiner that the freeze on federal funding is demonstrative of the Trump administration’s governing by revenge.\n\n“It does seem like really bad politics, and I do feel like maybe it’s also reflective of just a larger tone shift by this administration that they’re not really governing to win it seems anymore,” Shroff said. “But just to abuse, to drive the news cycle, to keep their grift going for what seems like maybe a shorter term window that they have in mind.” \n\nBrad Bannon, another Democratic strategist, similarly claimed this was “Donald Trump again, putting his own political vendetta ahead of the lives of women and children.”\n\n“And it’s a perfect opportunity to strike out against Trump for ignoring the economic realities of women and children and child care and how important that is to the economy,” he added. \n\nThe GOP clearly sees cracking down on abuse and fraud as a clear winner after reports showed that $1 billion in taxpayer money was stolen in three separate fraud schemes in Minnesota meant to support providers assisting people at risk of homelessness, provide therapy for autistic children, and feed children during the COVID-19 pandemic. \n\nBut the cuts also come as the administration and lawmakers on Capitol Hill are still hashing out next steps on the expired Affordable Care Act‘s premium tax credits, as well as the GOP still reeling over Trump’s admonition “to be flexible on Hyde,” on Tuesday, referencing the legislative provision barring federal funds from financing abortion services.\n\nDemocrats have used an affordability message, which Trump has called a “hoax,” to help win back races in several elections in 2025 and begin to reunify a fractured party, while also blaming the White House for increasing healthcare costs for the public.\n\n“For all the flak Hakeem Jeffries gets, he pretty much rolled Mike Johnson at the end of the year, won over, even some Republicans, some really pretty MAGA Republicans, to have this discharge position petition vote. So I do think they’re actually pretty effective on it, and effective messengers,” Shroff said.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt defended the administration’s crackdown on the fraud in Minnesota and elsewhere during a Wednesday briefing. \n\n“When it comes to Minnesota, the fraud that we have seen, the wide scale of fraud, is really remarkable. It’s egregious,” Leavitt said. “The Department of Health and Human Services has also begun requiring a justification and photo evidence for all child care-related payments nationwide, and they required Minnesota to conduct a full audit of all child care centers. They also froze $185 million in funding to Minnesota.”\n\nThe Justice Department has charged 98 defendants in several Medicaid fraud and related case programs, with 64 of whom have been convicted, according to Leavitt. The Department of Homeland Security has also conducted investigations on the ground in Minneapolis, while the Department of Labor is reviewing Minnesota’s unemployment program.\n\n“This is an all-hands-on-deck effort from the entire administration to get to the bottom of this and to ensure that the ripping off of taxpayers in the state of Minnesota, and it won’t just be Minnesota,” she said. “It’ll be any state across this country where fraud has taken place, and we are protecting law-abiding, taxpaying American citizens.”\n\nAgriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins noted that 22 blue states have refused to share their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program data, impairing the agency’s ability to “figure out and ensure that those who really need these programs are actually getting these programs.” \n\n“Clearly, you all have been writing about Minnesota; California is next,” Rollins said at the briefing. “We’re looking at New York, some other states. The amount of fraud in all of these programs is absolutely stunning.”\n\nTRUMP AIRS GRIEVANCES AND PREACHES HEALTHCARE MIDTERM FOCUS AT HOUSE GOP RETREAT: ‘YOU’VE GOT TO BE FLEXIBLE ON HYDE’\n\nBut Brown, a fellow with the Ethics and Public Policy Center, cautioned that the tactics are reminiscent of the Department of Government Efficiency’s mixed results in slashing the federal budget.\n\n“This idea that because of these cases of fraud in Minnesota, we now need to just slam that red button and stop the presses and not fund these child care block grants … it’s exactly the DOGE playbook all over again,” he said. “And I do not see that as a particularly effective way of going about rooting out fraud and abuse, and I don’t expect it’ll be that effective this time either.”\n\nRepublicans and Democratic strategists claimed that Trump is simply using the power of the federal government to bend lawmakers to his will, a tactic he has employed for much of his second administration.\n\n“If blue-state governors want Washington money, they should follow federal law and policy rather than treating the Treasury as an ATM. It shouldn’t surprise anyone that Trump is using hardball tactics against Democrat governors in Democratic states,” Dennis Lennox, a GOP strategist, said. “Freezing funds forces Democrats to choose between investigating and prosecuting fraud and siding with fraud and abuse, the latter of which is hardly a winning position to take.”\n\n“It’s actually kind of brilliant on Trump’s part, because he’s not thinking electorally. He’s not thinking about the next election,” Michael Ceraso, a Democratic strategist, said. “He’s thinking about right now and what he can do to lean in and hold states that are dependent on federal resources hostage.”","summary":"Democrats quickly slammed the Donald Trump White House’s recent decision to cut $10 billion&#160;in funds for child care and social services across five states as a “vindictive” effort to harm families struggling financially.

Democratic nominee race: Gavin Newsom Vs Kamala Harris As the 2028 presidential race slowly comes into view, two of California’s most powerful Democrats—Vice President Kamala Harris and Governor Gavin Newsom—appear headed toward a potential showdown that could test friendships, loyalties and donor networks across the party. While both insist nothing is imminent, their moves suggest mutual awareness and quiet preparation. Newsom has told allies he is considering a White House run after leaving office in January 2027, while Harris remains publicly noncommittal, calling 2028 “three years from now.”Behind the scenes, however, Harris has taken steps that resemble early campaign positioning, including setting up a political action committee, reconnecting with newly elected Democrats nationwide and purchasing her own email list for roughly $7 million. Newsom’s allies, meanwhile, question whether Harris will run at all, citing her memoir 107 Days, which ruffled feathers within Democratic circles.Polls show Newsom currently enjoys more enthusiasm among California voters, but Harris retains deep institutional ties and national recognition. Should both enter the race, consultants, donors and advisers—many of whom have worked for both—could be forced into uncomfortable choices. For now, the rivalry remains polite, personal and quietly combustible.","summary":"US Vice President JD Vance ignited a political firestorm by predicting the \"dumbest\" candidate would win the Democratic presidential race, slamming both Kamala Harris as unqualified and Gavin Newsom as corrupt.","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/unqualified-vs-corrupt-jd-vance-mocks-harrisnewsom-2028-face-off-says-dumbest-candidate-will-win/articleshow/126411831.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-126412427/126412427.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-08 11:30:00","author":"Toi World Desk","authors":["Toi World Desk"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.141},{"id":391971294,"title":"As midterms loom, Republicans in Congress are heading for the exits | Opinion","text":"The midterm elections for Congress won’t take place until November, but already a record number of members have declared their intention not to run – a total of 43 in the House, plus 10 senators. Perhaps the most high-profile person to depart, Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, announced her intention in November not just to retire but to resign from Congress entirely on Jan. 5 – a full year before her term was set to expire.\n\nThere are political dynamics that explain this rush to the exits, including frustrations with gridlock and President Donald Trump’s lackluster approval ratings, which could hurt Republicans at the ballot box.\n\nRather than get swept away by a prospective “blue wave” favoring Democrats – or possibly daunted by the monumental effort it would take to survive – many Republicans have decided to fold up the beach chairs and head home before the wave crashes.\n\nAs of now, two dozen Republican House members have either resigned from the House or announced their intent to not run for reelection in 2026. With only two exceptions – Republicans in 2018 and 2020 – this is more departures from either party at this point in the election calendar than any other cycle over the past 20 years.\n\nThere is also growing concern within the House Republican caucus that Greene’s announcement is a canary in the coal mine, and that multiple resignations will follow.\n\nAs a political scientist who studies Congress and politicians’ reelection strategies, I’m not surprised to see many House members leaving ahead of what’s shaping up to be a difficult midterm for the GOP.\n\nStill, the sheer number of people not running tells us something about broader dissatisfaction with Washington.\n\nMore from Freep Opinion: Trump looms over 2026, from war fears to democratic collapse\n\nWhy do members leave Congress?\n\nMany planned departures are true retirements involving older and more experienced members.\n\nFor example, 78-year-old Democratic congressman Jerry Nadler is retiring after 34 years, following mounting pressure from upstart challengers and a growing consensus among Democrats that it’s time for older politicians to step aside. Nancy Pelosi, the former speaker who will turn 86 in March, is also retiring.\n\nSometimes, members of Congress depart for the same reasons other workers might leave any job. Like many Americans, members of Congress might find something better elsewhere.\n\nRetiring members are attractive hires for lobbying firms and corporations, thanks to their insider knowledge and connections within the institution. These firms usually offer much higher salaries than members are used to in Congress, which may explain why more than half of all living former members are lobbyists of some kind.\n\nOther members remain ambitious for elective office, and decide to use their positions in Congress as a springboard for another elected role. Members of the House regularly retire to run for a Senate seat, such as, in this cycle, Democratic Rep. Haley Stevens of Michigan. Others run for executive offices, including governor, like Republican Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina.\n\nBut some are leaving Congress due to growing frustration with the job and an inability to get things done. Specifically, many retiring members cite growing dysfunction within their own party, or in Congress as a whole, as the reason they’re moving on.\n\nIn a statement announcing his departure in June, Sen. Thom Tillis, R-North Carolina, mused that “between spending another six years navigating the political theater and partisan gridlock in Washington or spending that time with my family,” it was “not a hard choice” to leave the Senate.\n\nMore from Freep Opinion: Trump's unauthorized Venezuela attack won't help Americans\n\nWhat’s unique about 2026?\n\nIn addition, there are a few other factors that can help explain why so many Republicans, in particular, are heading for the exits leading up to 2026.\n\nThe shifting of boundaries that has come with the mid-decade redistricting process in several states this year has scrambled members’ priorities. Unfamiliar districts can drive incumbents to early retirement by severing their connections with well-established constituencies.\n\nIn Texas, six Republicans and three Democrats – nearly a quarter of the state’s entire House delegation – are either retiring or running for other offices, due in part to that state’s new gerrymander for 2026.\n\nAll decisions about retirement and reelection are sifted through the filter of electoral and partisan considerations. A phenomenon called “thermostatic politics” predicts that parties currently in power, particularly in the White House, tend to face a backlash from voters in the following election. In other words, the president’s party nearly always loses seats in midterms.\n\nIn 2006 and 2018, for example, Republican members of Congress were weighed down by the reputations of unpopular Republican Presidents George W. Bush and Trump. Republicans had arguably even greater success in midterm elections during Barack Obama’s presidency.\n\nCurrently, 2026 looks like it will present a poor national environment for Republicans. Trump remains highly unpopular, according to polls, and Democrats are opening up a consistent lead in the “generic ballot” question, which asks respondents which party they intend to support in the 2026 midterms without reference to individual candidates.\n\nDemocrats have already been overperforming in special elections, as well as the general election in November in states such as New Jersey and Virginia, which held elections for governor. Democrats are on average running 13 points ahead of Kamala Harris’ performance in the 2024 election.\n\nAs a result, even Republicans in districts thought to be safe for their party may see themselves in enough potential danger to abandon the fight in advance.\n\nRetirement vs. resignation\n\nOne final, unique aspect of this election cycle with major consequences is not an electoral but an institutional one.\n\nHouse conservatives are quietly revolting against Speaker Mike Johnson’s leadership style. That members may be frustrated enough not just to retire but resign in advance, leaving their seats temporarily vacant, is a notable sign of dysfunction in the U.S. House.\n\nThis also could have a major impact on policy, given how slim the Republicans’ majority in the lower chamber is already. Whatever the outcome of the midterms in November, these departures clearly matter in Washington and offer important signals about the chaos in Congress.\n\nCharlie Hunt is an associate professor of political science at Boise State University.

Kristi Noem ⬇ During her first press conference in Texas soon after the shooting, the Homeland Security Secretary claimed the incident was “an act of domestic terrorism“ after ICE officers “got stuck in the snow,“ adding, “They were attempting to push out their vehicle, and a woman attacked them, and those surrounding them, and attempted to run them over.“ Videos widely circulated on social media immediately contradicted both claims, making her initial story look as fake as the camouflage and sandbag props decorating the lectern she was delivering it from. Gregory Bovino ⬆ By the time Noem got to Minneapolis for her second press conference, this time vowing federal prosecutions for using vehicles as weapons, the Border Patrol commander was standing alongside her. After a federal judge found he lied about using tear gas in his Chicago operation, he finally got to take a break from being the craziest, most ruthless face of Trump’s immigration crackdown. Representative James Comer ⬇ While the shooting took place on Wednesday morning, the House Oversight Chairman was holding hearings on Republicans' best hit during the immigration debate: allegations of billions of welfare fraud by Somalis in Minnesota. By afternoon, the only thing anyone in Minnesota was talking about was the ICE shooting. Nothing kills a carefully choreographed scandal like an actual shooting. Governor Tim Walz ⬆ Comer and other Republicans had drawn political blood with the scandal, calling the Minnesota governor “asleep at the wheel,“ humiliating Kamala Harris’s former running mate into dropping his bid for re-election. The scandal is now pushed off the front page, and he’s vowing “a full, fair, and expeditious investigation.“ Senator Amy Klobuchar ⬆ A likely replacement for Walz on the Minnesota governor’s ticket, she issued a statement that began “I am praying for the family and loved ones of the woman who was shot and killed“ and ended without scoring political points with attacks on ICE or federal agents. In 2026, that passes for statesmanship. 'Abolish ICE' ⬆ A fringe slogan once as politically toxic as “defund the police.“ Now former Bush administration official and veteran conservative commentator Bill Kristol is saying it. The shooting accomplished what a thousand family separation protests that birthed the slogan in Trump’s first term couldn't—making a far-leftist issue respectable in neoconservative circles. Originally a staple of Newsweek's print edition, Conventional Wisdom used arrows to track whose stock was rising or falling in the political circus. We're reviving it in the digital age because the problem it lampooned—hyperbole and partisan certainty masquerading as insight—has only intensified. CW assigns arrows—up, down, or sideways—to the figures and forces shaping current events. The arrows don't predict the future or claim special insight. They capture the prevailing winds of the moment, uncluttered by tribal howling. In an era when partisan media reinforces rather than questions assumptions, CW operates from the center—skeptical of left and right alike, committed to puncturing inflated reputations and recognizing overlooked truths.","summary":"Featuring Kristi Noem, James Comer, Gregory Bovino and Tim Walz.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/conventional-wisdom-minneapolis-ice-shooting-noem-walz-klobuchar-11327357","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/CONVENTIONAL-WISDOM-01.08.26.jpeg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-08 11:00:00","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.222},{"id":391950970,"title":"US immigration agent fatally shoots woman in Minneapolis","text":"A US immigration agent has shot dead a 37-year-old woman in the city of Minneapolis, sparking protests overnight.\n\nFederal officials said the woman, Renee Nicole Good, had tried to run over immigration agents with her car but the city mayor said the agent who shot her had acted recklessly.\n\nVideos of the incident show ICE agents approaching a car which is in the middle of the street.

I’d be lying if I said it wasn’t tough,” she told Paul. “It was a big adjustment having them come in, and then having to adjust my schedule and just kind of go about my day. It’s weird when you’re just like hanging out with your friends, a group of girls, and you have like a tall guy standing like three feet behind you. It’s weird.”\n\nAs far as dating goes, the golfer said she is still adjusting to the agents’ presence. \n\n“To be honest, it’s really awkward when you’re... going on a date with a guy and they’re two tables behind you. It’s a little weird,” she said. “But I try my best not to let it bother me, and I think I’ve learned, especially in the last year now... [that] yes, they’re following me, but also to focus and pretend like they’re not there.”\n\nDuring another portion of the podcast, Trump revealed that her grandfather has no plans to run for president again. \n\nHowever, she did not completely shut down rumors that he could run for an unprecedented third term in office, noting there were still three years until the election. \n\nOn Paul’s podcast, she also lifted the lid on her feelings about former Vice President Kamala Harris, whom her grandfather defeated in the 2024 election. She told Paul that there is no “bad blood” between her and the Democrat, who is widely believed to be planning another bid for the White House in 2028.\n\n“To be honest with you, I stay out of politics completely,” Kai said when Paul asked her opinion on Harris. “Like, I would never run and I don't want anything to do with politics.\n\n“I feel like politics is such a dangerous thing, and I think if both sides met in the middle, everyone would be so much more happier, and I think there's radical left, there's radical right, and there's a lot of people who get too extreme.”\n\nShe added that she was “very much in the middle” and said Harris’s frosty relationship with her grandfather “is what it is.”","summary":"The president’s granddaughter recently made her first podcast appearance speaking to Logan Paul","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/kai-trump-interview-dating-secret-service-b2896710.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2026/01/07/15/06/GettyImages-2246397592.jpeg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/1c4wPAYi-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2026-01-08 10:11:17","author":"Brittany Miller","authors":["Brittany Miller"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.214},{"id":391944234,"title":"Shapiro launches reelection bid in Pennsylvania as 2028 looms","text":"The governor’s race will determine whether Shapiro can bolster his strongest argument for being Democrats’ 2028 standard-bearer: His ability to win sweeping victories and provide coattails to down-ticket Democrats in the country’s biggest, most important swing state.\n\nThe 52-year-old moderate Democrat has methodically climbed the political ladder from congressional aide to attorney general to top state executive over a more than 20-year career in which he’s never lost a race. His 15-point landslide victory in 2022 over Republican firebrand Doug Mastriano further burnished his reputation and put him on the national political map. And his favorability ratings in the state remain unusually high in this era of partisan polarization — a reason he was on the short list to be Kamala Harris’ running mate in 2024.\n\nPennsylvania-based Democratic strategist J.J. Abbott said that if Shapiro can run up the score again in a “big, important swing state” it would be a “strong credential” for the governor should he run in 2028.\n\nShapiro is not expected to face a significant primary challenger. He’ll likely square off against Republican state Treasurer Stacy Garrity, who has the backing of the state GOP, in November, after Mastriano declined Wednesday to seek a rematch. A fall Quinnipiac University poll showed Shapiro leading Garrity by 15 points.\n\nHe starts his bid for a second term ranked as one of the 10 most popular governors in the country. He’s highly popular at home — polls conducted over the fall showed his approval rating among Keystone State voters was higher than other recent Pennsylvania governors at the same point in their first term. Sixty percent of Pennsylvania voters gave the governor a thumbs-up in a late-September Quinnipiac University poll, while 51 percent said he was doing a “good” or “excellent” job in an October Franklin and Marshall College poll — including half of independents and a quarter of Republicans.\n\nBut Republicans don’t intend to let Shapiro off easy in a race that will decide which party controls a critical swing state heading into 2028. Garrity has been working to turn scuttlebutt about Shapiro’s higher-office ambitions and his cascade of criticism of President Donald Trump into a campaign cudgel, accusing him of being more focused on his future than on Pennsylvania’s present. Shapiro is embarking on a book tour later this month for his forthcoming memoir that’s fueling speculation about his 2028 intentions.\n\nThe state party is also teasing a series “exposing the years of corruption and scandal” surrounding Shapiro. And operatives in both parties point to criticism Shapiro has faced over his handling of a sexual harassment complaint against a former top aide and the lack of transparency surrounding fixes and upgrades to the governor’s public and private residences after last year’s arson attack as potential attack lines for Republicans — and fodder for his potential 2028 rivals.","url":"https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/08/shapiro-launches-reelection-pennsylvania-00715593","image":"https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/391a0d3/2147483647/resize/1200x/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fb5%2F2e%2F780e7ba44a1f885c7db853ef247e%2Felection-2024-harris-74541.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-08 10:01:00","author":"Lisa Kashinsky","authors":["Lisa Kashinsky"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.286},{"id":391930204,"title":"Shapiro kicks off 2026 re-election as 2028 White House buzz swirls","text":"Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro kicked off his 2026 re-election campaign Thursday, a move seen as a potential stepping stone for a Democratic presidential run in 2028. In a re-election campaign launch video shared with Fox News Digital, Shapiro highlighted his pragmatic approach as governor to get things done for Pennsylvanians. \"We've gotten shit done all across our Commonwealth to make a real difference in people's lives. Now, Pennsylvania is open for business,\" the governor said, repeating his unofficial slogan. And Shapiro, who was high up on then-Vice President Kamala Harris's shortlist for running mate in the summer of 2024, after she replaced then-President Biden as the Democratic Party's presidential nominee, pointed to the rebuilding of an interstate overpass that collapsed in 2023, shutting down one of the nation's busiest highways. JOSH SHAPIRO DEFENDS CLAIM THAT KAMALA HARRIS TRYING TO ‘COVER HER A—’ WITH CRITICAL BOOK EXCERPT \"When disaster struck, others underestimated us. But I never did. Reopen and ready for travelers, just 12 days after a devastating collapse,\" Shaprio said in the video. \"We cut through the red tape to get I-95 rebuilt in record time. We did it using materials from a Pennsylvania business and with the muscle and know-how of Pennsylvania union workers.\" In the video, which showcases the governor's accomplishments, Shapiro also touts his bipartisan efforts, noting that \"even with a divided state legislature — together — we've gotten a whole lot done on issues that have been stuck for decades. But there's always more to do — more people to help, more Pennsylvanians to protect, more bridges to build.\" Following his video launch, the governor is scheduled to hold campaign kick-off events Thursday in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. Shapiro's launch comes two days after his campaign showcased their war chest, announcing that the governor hauled in $10 million in fundraising in the final quarter of last year and started the new year with more than $30 million in his coffers. The governor, a former two-term Pennsylvania attorney general who defeated conservative state Sen. Doug Mastriano by 15 points four years ago in the key battleground state's gubernatorial election, is likely to face state Treasurer Stacy Garrity as his Republican challenger this November. FRAUD FALLOUT FORCES WALZ TO ABANDON GUBERNATORIAL RE-ELECTION BID Garrity, hoping to avoid an expensive and divisive primary, has already lined up endorsements and support from many Pennsylvania Republicans, including the backing of the state GOP. And Mastriano, who had been mulling a second straight bid, announced on Wednesday that he wouldn't run for governor this year. \"The truth is that Josh Shapiro ignored the problems facing hardworking Pennsylvanians to gallivant around the country to raise money from liberal billionaires,\" Matt Beynon, a top Garrity campaign adviser, told Fox News Digital. \"Less than half of 8th graders read at grade level, over 3,000 of our bridges are deficient, and Pennsylvania families have one of the highest tax burdens in the country.\" But Shapiro enters the new year with formidable approval and favorable ratings in public opinion polls, and his campaign, pointing to his fundraising, said the governor was \"in a position of unprecedented strength.\" A release from the campaign highlighted that the governor \"is reporting the most money raised and the highest ending cash balance during the off-year ahead of an election of any Pennsylvania gubernatorial campaign on record.\" DEMOCRATIC HEAVYWEIGHTS HARRIS, NEWSOM TURN HEADS, FUEL 2028 SPECULATION A sizable November victory by Shapiro in the high-profile general election swing state could give the governor momentum heading into what is likely to be a crowded and competitive race for the next Democratic presidential nomination. And that field could include candidates with much higher name recognition, including California Gov. Gavin Newsom and former Vice President Kamala Harris. \"Anybody who has shown any interest in running for president will absolutely be closely watched during this year's elections, and it's only natural that they'll be judged initially on their abilities in their home state,\" longtime Democratic strategist Joe Caiazzo, a veteran of multiple presidential campaigns, told Fox News Digital. Behind the scenes, Shapiro spent part of 2025 increasing his grip on the state party. And he recruited and cleared the field for a handful of congressional candidates in Pennsylvania running in what will likely be crucial midterm elections in the battle for the House majority. The governor also campaigned for fellow Democrats on the ballot last year in Pennsylvania, helping his party to convincing victories in the off-year elections. And Shapiro also traveled to neighboring New Jersey to campaign on behalf of now-Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill in the high-profile gubernatorial showdown. His efforts further raised his national profile and sparked further 2028 speculation.

Seth Moulton hopes to restore constituent faith in Democrats","text":"PITTSFIELD — To U.S. Rep. Seth Moulton, the United States' incursion into Venezuela on Friday without prior congressional approval was just the latest example of President Trump’s “frankly insane” approach to governing.\n\nBut while much of his frustration is reserved for Trump, the Democrat also lays some of the blame at the feet of his own party for allowing the president to return to power in 2024 and lead without sufficient opposition.\n\n“We haven't challenged him effectively,” Moulton said. “I think we can all agree on that. And the bottom line is that the old playbook, the establishment approach, is not working.”\n\nJunking that playbook is at the heart of Moulton’s bid for Senate, where he hopes to defeat two-term incumbent U.S. Sen. Ed Markey in the 2026 midterm election. During a meeting with The Eagle's editorial board on Tuesday, Moulton, who represents the 6th Congressional District that includes Salem, diagnosed the Democratic Party’s main weakness as a lack of coherent policy stances on major issues.\n\n“Democrats need to be more outspoken and more simple and clear about how wrong this is,” he said of Trump’s decision to have military forces oust Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. That clarity of purpose also needs to extend to the party’s core issues, he said, whether it’s immigration, artificial intelligence or public transportation.\n\n“[Voters have] got to be able to see some leadership that's going to take us forward,” he said.\n\nMoulton announced in October that he planned to challenge Markey for his Senate seat. After serving as a House representative for over a decade, Moulton said he now feels that his leadership would be more effective beyond a single district.\n\n“There are also a lot of things I would like to do that are ‘whole of Massachusetts’ issues,” he said. While he has grand ambitions for a nationwide high-speed rail system, for example, he said he wants to see public transportation strengthened at the state level.\n\n“I also just want to, at a local level, make it faster than driving to get around Massachusetts, because that's actually the transformative change we need to dramatically increase affordable housing and access to jobs,” he said. \n\nAmong other priorities, he described a desire for Democrats to enact a clearer stance on immigration based on three core tenets: Prosecuting Immigration Customs and Enforcement agents who violate policies; encouraging legal immigration while discouraging illegal immigration; and creating a simpler path to citizenship.\n\n“[That platform] happens to be one that I think the majority of Americans could get behind,” he said. “But when our party isn't even able to articulate that from our leadership, then we've got to change.”\n\nIn calling for fresh faces in the Democratic Party, Moulton certainly isn’t alone. Promising a new approach to politics is becoming a familiar tactic for aspiring Democratic leaders nationwide seeking to energize a disenchanted voter base after Kamala Harris’s defeat in the 2024 election. From Zohran Mamdani’s mayoral victory in New York City to Abigail Spanberger’s gubernatorial win in Virginia, securing elections now seems like more a possibility for young, left-leaning candidates.\n\nMoulton is also currently outpacing Markey in campaign funding, with the Boston Globe reporting he has over $3 million to draw on heading into 2026 while Markey has $2.7 million.\n\nBut Markey, an incumbent who’s filled the seat since 2013, will prove difficult to take down. In 2020, he successfully defeated a primary challenger by over 100,000 votes. Moulton hopes to persuade voters to embrace a new candidate by capitalizing on Markey's age (he will turn 80 this year) and characterizing him as a member of the Democratic old guard that needs to be voted out.\n\nIt won’t be the first time that Moulton, 47, has pointed out a fellow Democrat’s age as a liability. He previously voiced concerns about former President Joe Biden’s fitness to run for office in 2024, and feels that Democrats did not properly address voters’ concerns on the issue.\n\n“There are a lot of Americans who just don't trust our party,” he said. “People could see with their own eyes that Biden was not ready to run for reelection. And again, the establishment Democratic Party just protected Joe Biden, which ended up really hurting our party.”\n\nMoulton has also upset members of his party before, weathering ire from Democratic peers and constituents in 2024 after he suggested in a New York Times interview that the party’s stance on transgender athletes alienated voters. (In subsequent interviews, he has clarified that he felt the issue should be more open to debate and discussion within the party).\n\nWhile he emphasized his belief that Democrats should be vocal about furthering their goals, Moulton said he also believes bipartisan collaboration would be essential to a successful Senate term.\n\n“You have to be able to have respectful relationships across the aisle to get things done, at the same time as you're willing to just fight Republicans tooth and nail,\" he said. \"A lot of these guys are such cowards. They know that Trump's terrible. They know that they don't want to support wars in Venezuela.”\n\nMoulton, currently a resident of Salem, visited Pittsfield as part of a Western Massachusetts listening tour that also included a brief stop in Springfield. As a representative whose district spans the area north of Boston, Moulton admitted he still needed to familiarize himself more deeply with other areas of the state.\n\n“I'm going to be a senator who genuinely represents Massachusetts and spends a lot of time in the parts of Massachusetts where I don't live,” he said, naming Western Massachusetts and South Coast as examples. “These are places that I need to learn more to represent better.”","summary":"“We haven't challenged [Trump] effectively,” Moulton said. “I think we can all agree on that.

As it attempts to drive off, one of them points his gun at the driver and at least two shots are heard. The FBI is investigating.\n\nHundreds of ICE agents have been deployed to Minneapolis, in the state of Minnesota, as part of the White House's crackdown on illegal immigration.\n\nVideos posted to social media by onlookers appear to show the moment of the shooting, which occurred around 10:25 local time on Wednesday morning.\n\nFrom various vantage points, a maroon SUV can be seen blocking a residential street in Minneapolis.\n\nA crowd of people, who appear to be protesting, are lining the pavement.\n\nLaw enforcement vehicles appear nearby. ICE agents (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) pull up to the vehicle parked in the street, emerge from the truck and tell the woman behind the wheel to get out of the SUV. One of the agents tugs at the driver's side door handle.\n\nAnother agent is positioned near the front of the vehicle.\n\nIt's not clear exactly how close the agent is standing or whether he was struck by the vehicle based on the videos reviewed immediately by the BBC.\n\nThat agent opens fire as the maroon SUV attempts to drive off.\n\nThe vehicle can be seen losing control and crashing into a car parked nearby along the street.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social, Trump said an ICE officer was \"viciously\" run over. \"It is hard to believe he is alive, but is now recovering in the hospital,\" he wrote.\n\nThe Republican president also blamed the \"Radical Left\" for \"threatening, assaulting, and targeting our Law Enforcement Officers and ICE Agents on a daily basis\".\n\nMinneapolis police chief Brian O'Hara said the driver was in her vehicle and was blocking the roadway on Portland Avenue. She was then approached on foot by a federal law enforcement officer, \"and she began to drive off\".\n\nUS Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the woman was \"stalking and impeding\" officers throughout the day and tried to \"weaponise her vehicle\" in an attempt to run over the officer in an act of \"domestic terrorism\".\n\nThe federal agent fired \"defensive shots\" and was himself injured, Noem said, before he was treated and discharged from a local hospital.\n\nThe Minneapolis City Council, however, said in a statement that Good was simply \"caring for her neighbours\" when she was shot and killed.\n\nThe same agent was also hit by a car in the line of duty in June, Noem said.\n\nShe added that ICE operations in the city would continue, and the FBI would investigate Wednesday's incident.\n\nEmily Heller told CNN she was at home when she saw the ICE agents arguing with protesters outside. She said she heard agents shouting at a woman driving an SUV, then one agent tried to open her car door, and the driver went into reverse and began pulling away.\n\n\"An ICE agent stepped in front of her vehicle and said, 'Stop!' and then - I mean, she was already moving - and then, point blank, shot her through her windshield in the face,\" Heller told the US network.\n\nMinnesota State Governor Tim Walz also pushed back on federal accounts of the incident.\n\n\"Don't believe this propaganda machine,\" Walz wrote in response to a Department of Homeland Security post about the shooting.\n\n\"The state will ensure there is a full, fair, and expeditious investigation to ensure accountability and justice.\"\n\nTop Democrats, including former Vice-President Kamala Harris and House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries, also released statements. Harris called the Trump administration's version of events \"gaslighting\".\n\nProtests and marches took place in several parts of the city as some outraged Minneapolis residents condemned the shooting and called for ICE to leave.\n\nThe scene of the shooting is about one mile from where George Floyd was murdered in 2020 by a city police officer, sparking worldwide anti-racism protests.\n\nProtests were being organised in other US cities, including New Orleans, Miami, Seattle and New York City.\n\nMinneapolis Public Schools announced that classes were cancelled for the rest of the week, \"due to safety concerns\". It comes after federal agents reportedly made arrests outside a high school on Wednesday.\n\nWhy is ICE in Minneapolis?\n\nThe Trump administration deployed an additional 2,000 federal agents to the Minneapolis area in recent weeks in response to allegations of welfare fraud in the state.\n\nThe mayor said in the Wednesday press conference that ICE was not making the city safer. \"They're ripping families apart, they're sowing chaos in our streets,\" he said.\n\nThe deployment, which began on Sunday, is one of the largest concentrations of Department of Homeland Security personnel in a US city in recent years.\n\nIt follows an immigration enforcement campaign launched by ICE late last year to target individuals in Minneapolis who were issued deportation orders, including members of the city's Somali community.\n\nThat community has been criticised frequently by Trump, who has called them \"garbage\".\n\n\"I don't want them in our country. I'll be honest with you,\" the president has said. \"Their country's no good for a reason. Their country stinks.\"\n\nTrump later doubled-down on his remarks after a YouTube video by a conservative online content creator accused daycare centres run by Somali immigrants of mass fraud.\n\nIn response, Trump has withheld federal childcare funds from the state of Minnesota.\n\nThe Trump administration has sent ICE agents to other cities across the US, where they have made thousands of arrests as part of what the administration says is a crackdown on crime and immigrants who illegally entered the country.","url":"https://www.graphic.com.gh/international/international-news/us-immigration-agent-fatally-shoots-woman-in-minneapolis.html","image":"https://www.graphic.com.gh/images/2026/January/08/ICE.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-08 09:35:05","author":"Jemima Okang Addae","authors":["Jemima Okang Addae"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gh","sentiment":-0.534},{"id":391923038,"title":"Critics draw iffy link between Gavin Newsom’s record and Minnesota’s food fraud scandal","text":"Last month, as required by law, State Auditor Grant Parks published an annual report on state programs and agencies that his office deems to be at “high risk” of costly inefficiency, waste or fraud.\n\nThe report reiterated concerns about seven situations, two of which have been on the list since 2007, including the bureaucracy’s chronic inability to successfully employ information technology — embarrassing for a state that is the global center for digital tools.\n\nParks has added a new program in his latest overview, the Department of Social Service’s food aid for poor families, once called food stamps but now known as CalFresh.\n\nThe federal government primarily finances supplemental food benefits, but the state’s share is determined, in part, by its management, as indicated by its rate of error when determining people’s eligibility.\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill tightens the error rate thresholds. Thus, Parks notes, California’s 11% error rate, if not improved, could require the state to “spend about $2 billion annually to maintain CalFresh benefits.”\n\nThe most disturbing item on Parks’ list is the continuing inability of the Employment Development Department to effectively manage unemployment insurance benefits, which first came to light during the COVID-19 pandemic. Billions of dollars in fraudulent benefit claims were approved, almost all of which came in a federally financed expansion of the program.\n\nBy happenstance, the high risk report was released just as a scandal was erupting in Minnesota over widespread fraud in a program meant to keep children fed during the pandemic.\n\nDozens of people, mostly in Minnesota’s substantial Somali population, have been charged with looting the program by setting up companies that billed the state for supplying food that was never delivered.\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz, whom Kamala Harris chose as her running mate in her campaign for president in 2024, felt the political fallout from the scandal — generated mostly in right-leaning media outlets — and this week dropped his bid for re-election.\n\nMeanwhile, those same outlets — blogs, podcasts and YouTube videos — have been making an accusatory connection between the Minnesota scandal and the Parks report, suggesting the report proves the same kind of fraud was even more rampant in California and laying the blame on Gov. Gavin Newsom, who’s a likely 2028 candidate for president.\n\nThis week, Steve Hilton, a Republican candidate for California governor, and Herb Morgan, a Republican running for state controller, cited the Parks report, their own research and tips from whistleblowers in a broad assertion, dubbed “CALIFRAUDIA,” that “California’s exposure to fraud, waste, and abuse across major state programs is likely to reach $250 billion,” adding that it “underscores the urgent need for formal investigation and audit, as a matter of basic fiscal responsibility.”\n\nHowever, the allegations of widespread fraud and mismanagement during Newsom’s governorship is not confined to those on the starboard side of the political balance beam.\n\nKhanna told Politico, “I don’t know what the specific number is” of dollars lost to fraud or mismanagement. “It’s not particular to any person,” Khanna said. “It’s making government more effective. Tackling the mismanagement and waste and some fraud will build more credibility for asking for higher taxes.”\n\nNewsom’s staff responded by accusing Khanna of making a “MAGA made-up claim.”\n\nThere’s a reason why veterans of political wars refer to election years as the “silly season,” when political figures seeking media attention are prone to convert anthills of fact into mountains of rhetorical fantasy.\n\nDan Walters is a CalMatters columnist.","summary":"Newsom’s staff responded by accusing Khanna of making a “MAGA made-up claim.”","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2026/01/07/critics-draw-iffy-link-between-gavin-newsoms-record-and-minnesotas-food-fraud-scandal/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Congress_Epstein_19988.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-08 07:26:22","author":"Dan Walters","authors":["Dan Walters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.033},{"id":391902558,"title":"US immigration agent fatally shoots woman in Minneapolis, officials say","text":"A US immigration agent fatally shot a 37-year-old woman on Wednesday in the city of Minneapolis, but the details of what led up to the incident have left a wide chasm between federal and local government officials.\n\nTrump administration officials claim the woman, identified as Renee Nicole Good, was a “violent rioter” attempting to run over Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents when one agent fired “defensive shots” into her vehicle.\n\nBut city and state leaders, and Democrats nationally, are disputing that account.\n\nMinneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey claims that “this was an agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying”, telling ICE agents: “Get out of our city.”\n\nMultiple videos posted to social media by onlookers appear to show the moment of the shooting, which occurred around 10:25 local time.\n\nFrom various vantage points, a maroon SUV can be seen blocking a residential street in Minneapolis.

It is unclear if the vehicle struck him.\n\nThe vehicle's tyres appeared to be turning right as it went forward and not towards the ICE agent.\n\nThat agent fired three shots in quick succession into the front windscreen of the maroon car which then continued forward and crashed into two parked cars further down the road.\n\nA shorter video had clearer vision of the tyres of the maroon vehicle that were turning to the right as it moved forward.\n\nThe feet of the agent who fired the fatal shots can be seen jumping backwards from the maroon vehicle, but it is again difficult to tell if he was struck by the vehicle.\n\nA video posted on Truth Social by President Trump shows a different angle of the incident.\n\nThe footage is slowed down and only 13 seconds long, showing none of the lead-up to the incident.\n\nIt is unclear if there was contact between the maroon car and the ICE agent who fired the fatal shots.\n\nAnother short, low-quality video of the incident does appear to show some contact between the ICE agent and the maroon vehicle as it moved forward.\n\nIn a video from a second angle, examined by ABC NEWS Verify, it is unclear whether or not the agent and maroon vehicle came into contact.\n\nWhat is clear from this video is that the ICE agent who fired the fatal shots remained upright during the incident and walked towards the maroon vehicle after it crashed.\n\nThere is also limited evidence that ICE agents attempted to secure the scene.\n\nShortly after, Minneapolis city officials confirmed the identity of the victim as 37-year-old Renee Good.\n\n\"This was an agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying,\" Cr Jacob said.\n\nWhat happens now?\n\nUS officials, including President Trump and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, have claimed the vision showed the driver deliberately ramming the ICE agent, using the vehicle as a weapon, and described it as an act of \"domestic terrorism\".\n\n\"This appears as an attempt to kill or to cause bodily harm to agents,\" Ms Noem said.\n\nEyewitnesses and state and local officials including the Minneapolis mayor have disputed that claim.\n\nMinnesota Governor Tim Walz has promised a state investigation into the incident that would likely examine the lead-up and closely examine the maroon vehicle's tyre tracks and trajectory.\n\nIt is unclear if the ICE agents involved in the incident were wearing body-worn cameras.\n\nWhile agents have been involved in other non-fatal shootings during the Trump administration's immigration crackdown no officer has yet been charged.","summary":"ICE agents shot a woman in Minnesota.

And that is usually the best bellwether indicator to say to you what is really taking place.”\n\nUS President Donald Trump wears his trademark MAGA hat at a campaign rally at Lancaster Airport on November 3, 2024 in Lititz, Pennsylvania. (Photo: AFP)\n\nHaving helped over a quarter of a million immigrants to follow due process to regularise themselves through his company, Clare is well versed on immigration issues.\n\n“Don’t get me wrong, there is support for immigration, but the kind of consensus and aggressive support is not as potent as it used to be prior to the present president coming into office,” Clare said.\n\nHe said the behavioral changes among Jamaicans in the US are noticeable in even sanctuary cities like New York.\n\n“We still want to get our patties, still want to get a curry goat and oxtail etc. But I think now when we go out, and I say we because I’m cognisant of it too, you know, you kind of pay attention to where you are,” he said. “Yeah, they’re partying. But I’m certain that there’s some people who aren’t partying because of that reason, and those who are partying are very selective in where they go.\n\n“We have heard of ICE vehicles just passing by an event just to cause fear,” he continued, adding “sometimes White Plains Road, which is popular for Jamaicans, every now and then, the ICE vehicle just passes up there on the road, and you’d think it’s Thanksgiving [because] everybody’s inside.”\n\nRadio personality and chairman of the Jamaica Diaspora Crime Intervention and Prevention Task Force, Dr Rupert Francis, who has resided in the United States for over 26 years, said while the social scene was not dead or even dying, an air of caution was noticeable.\n\nIrwine Clare, chief operations officer at Caribbean Immigrant Services\n\n“Oh yes, of course, some people are hiding, some people are being more careful, not [gathering] drinking rum again at night, they’re not doing that,” Francis said. “When they used to maybe drive a little harder, they slow down, and many people I know drive around with their passports.\n\n“People are being more careful, they don’t want to get in any problem with anybody,” he added.\n\nFrancis also pointed to noticeable changes in the overseas travel patterns among Jamaican immigrants.\n\n“Some people are scared, if you look at the amount of Jamaicans coming back to Jamaica during December, apart from Melissa, the [airport] would be full, you could hardly get into Jamaica. Now, it’s not so. Why? Because they don’t want to come with their green cards or whatever, and then they cannot come back,” Francis said.\n\nAccording to Clare, overseas travel was being approached with some amount of caution, citing new rules regarding green cards, including the Laken Riley Act, passed soon after President Trump was inaugurated, which allows for the arrest and detention of non-citizens, including green card holders who commit certain crimes, without bail until their immigration proceedings are heard.\n\nPreviously, the law mainly mandated detention for serious offences such as drug and firearm crimes and human trafficking. The Laken Riley Act expanded those crimes to include misdemeanors such as shoplifting and burglary.\n\nGreen card holders who applied to become citizens and were denied and have not yet regularised themselves may also face difficulties while travelling internationally, Clare explained.\n\nDr Rupert Francis speaking at a demonstration in the United States.\n\nThe tension has affected some immigrant run businesses, according to New York City Council Candidate for District 41 – Brooklyn, Lawman Lynch.\n\n“From a financial perspective, many businesses previously relied on more affordable labour to offset the extremely high cost of operating in New York City. This is particularly true within Jamaican and broader Caribbean communities, which play a dominant role in the city’s food and restaurant industries,” he explained.\n\nCiting heightened enforcement visibility and reports of ICE activity, Lynch, who has lived in New York for over 15 years, said business owners have become far more cautious about hiring individuals who are not authorised to work in the United States.\n\n“Informal or “under-the-table” employment, while never without risk, is especially precarious in the current climate. Even when such arrangements exist, both employers and workers operate under heightened anxiety,” he said.\n\nLynch further said, “Socially, there is also a noticeable chilling effect. Restaurants, clubs, and other communal spaces are approached with caution. Earlier this year, while organising an immigrant resource fair, one of the most common concerns expressed by prospective attendees was whether ICE might appear. That level of fear underscores the broader impact on community life.”\n\nClare said his company no longer holds events like community forums discussing status regularisation, describing it as potentially leading lambs to the slaughter. \n\nFrancis sees collaboration with government and even entering government as a better path to change than protesting.\n\n“I do believe that the United States is one of the greatest places on earth, there’s a reason why everybody wants to come here, we have to be prepared to live by the rules, at the same time we have to make the place more user-friendly.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Donald Trump Dr Rupert Francis Immigration Irwine Clare \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Chief justice laudsperformance ofparish courts \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 7, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — Chief Justice Bryan Sykes has recognised the performance of several of the country’s courts and the strides being made to improve ... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Principals encouraged to utilise SBA concession offered by CXC \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 7, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — Principals are being encouraged to utilise the Caribbean Examinations Council’s (CXC) School-Based Assessment (SBA) Concession, wh... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Gov’t allocates $100 million for Shettlewood–Anchovy road project \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 7, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — The Government has allocated $100 million under the GO Road Rehabilitation Programme for works on critical sections of the roadway... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Sports \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Dunbeholden FC hammer Treasure Beach 4-0 in JPL \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 7, 2026 \n\n\n ST ELIZABETH, Jamaica — Dunbeholden FC hammered promoted Treasure Beach FC 4-0 in their rescheduled Jamaica Premier League (JPL) first round game play... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Di AMO Cawna Library opens in Cheshire Village with inclusive, accessible design \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 7, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — Di Cawna Library has opened its seventh community library in Cheshire Village, expanding access to books through an inclusive and ... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Charles Jr commends senior citizens embracing digital skills through GetConnected Programme \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 7, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — Labour and Social Security Minister Pearnel Charles Jr has commended senior citizens who are embracing digital skills through the ... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Respected former principal of Carron Hall High in St Mary has died \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 7, 2026 \n\n\n ST MARY, Jamaica – Retired educator and former principal of the Carron Hall High School in western St Mary, Dottlyn Norma Dawes has died.

(AP) — Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro will run for a second term in the pivotal battleground state after a first term that put him on the Democratic Party’s radar as a potential presidential contender in 2028.\n\nHe plans to make the formal announcement Thursday at events in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia.\n\nAlthough Shapiro hasn’t disclosed any ambitions for higher office, his reelection effort will be closely watched as another test of whether he’s White House material.\n\nEver since he won the governor’s office in a near-landslide victory in 2022, Shapiro has been mentioned alongside Democratic contemporaries like California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore and others as someone who could lead a national ticket.\n\nShapiro, 52, has already made rounds outside Pennsylvania. Last year, he campaigned for Democrats running for governor in New Jersey and Virginia, and he’s a frequent guest on Sunday talk shows that can shape the country’s political conversation. \n\nHe was also considered as a potential running mate for Kamala Harris in 2024. She chose Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz instead. \n\nA pivotal first term as governor\n\nShapiro’s first-term repeatedly put him in the spotlight. \n\nHe was governor when Pennsylvania was the site of the first attempted assassination of President Donald Trump; the capture of Luigi Mangione for allegedly killing United Healthcare chief executive Brian Thompson; and the murder of three police officers in the state’s deadliest day for law enforcement since 2009.\n\nLast year, an arsonist tried to kill Shapiro by setting the governor’s official residence on fire in the middle of the night. Shapiro had to flee with his wife, children and members of his extended family, and the attack made him a sought-out voice on the nation’s recent spate of political violence.\n\nAs Shapiro settled into the governor’s office, he shed his buttoned-down public demeanor and became more plain-spoken.\n\nHe pushed to quickly reopen a collapsed section of Interstate 95 in Philadelphia, debuting his new and profane governing slogan — “get s—- done” — at a ceremony for the completed project. \n\nHe crossed the partisan divide over school choice to support a Republican-backed voucher program, causing friction with Democratic lawmakers and allies in the state. \n\nShapiro regularly plays up the need for bipartisanship in a state with a politically divided Legislature, and positioned himself as a moderate on energy issues in a state that produces the most natural gas after Texas. \n\nHe’s rubbed elbows with corporate executives who are interested in Pennsylvania as a data center destination and thrust Pennsylvania into competition for billions of dollars being spent on manufacturing and artificial intelligence infrastructure.\n\nA repeat winner in competitive territory\n\nShapiro has enjoyed robust public approval ratings and carries a reputation as a disciplined messenger and powerhouse fundraiser. \n\nHe served two terms as state attorney general before getting elected governor, although his 2022 victory wasn’t the strongest test of his political viability. His opponent was state Sen. Doug Mastriano, whose right-wing politics alienated some Republican voters and left him politically isolated from the party’s leadership and donor base.\n\nFor 2026, Pennsylvania’s Republican Party endorsed Stacy Garrity, the twice-elected state treasurer, to challenge Shapiro.\n\nGarrity has campaigned around Pennsylvania and spoken at numerous Trump rallies in the battleground state, but she is untested as a fundraiser and will have to contend with her relatively low profile as compared to Shapiro. \n\nShapiro, meanwhile, keeps a busy public schedule, and has gone out of his way to appear at high-profile, non-political events like football games, a NASCAR race and onstage at a Roots concert in Philadelphia.\n\nHe is a regular on TV political shows, podcasts and local sports radio shows, and he keeps a social media staff that gives him a presence on TikTok and other platforms popular with Gen Z. He even went on Ted Nugent’s podcast, a rocker known for his hard-right political views and support for Trump.\n\nShapiro also became a leading pro-Israel voice among Democrats and Jewish politicians amid the Israel-Hamas war. He confronted divisions within the Democratic Party over the war, criticized what he describes as antisemitism amid pro-Palestinian demonstrations, and expressed solidarity with Israel in its drive to eliminate Hamas.\n\nIn 2024, some activists argued against him being the party’s nominee for vice president. Harris, in her recent book, wrote that she passed on Shapiro after determining that he wouldn’t be a good fit for the role. \n\nShapiro, she wrote, “mused that he would want to be in the room for every decision,” and she “had a nagging concern that he would be unable to settle for a role as number two and that it would wear on our partnership.” Shapiro disputed the characterization, telling The Atlantic that Harris’ accounts were ”blatant lies” and later, on MS NOW, said it “simply wasn’t true.” \n\nAn audition on 2026’s campaign trail\n\nIn a September appearance on NBC News’ “Meet the Press,” the host, Kristen Welker, asked him whether he’d commit to serving a full second term as governor and whether he’d rule out running for president in 2028.\n\n“I’m focused on doing my work here,” he said in sidestepping the questions.\n\nHis supposed White House aspirations — which he’s never actually admitted to in public — are also mentioned frequently by Garrity.\n\n“We need somebody that is more interested in Pennsylvania and not on Pennsylvania Avenue,” Garrity said on a radio show in Philadelphia.\n\nFor his part, Shapiro criticizes Garrity as too eager to get Trump’s endorsement to be an effective advocate for Pennsylvania.\n\nIn any case, the campaign trail could afford Shapiro an opportunity to audition for a White House run.\n\nFor one thing, Shapiro has been unafraid to criticize Trump, even in a swing state won by Trump in 2024. As governor, Shapiro has joined or filed more than a dozen lawsuits against Trump’s administration, primarily for holding up funding to states. \n\nHe has lambasted Trump’s tariffs as “reckless” and “dangerous,” Trump’s threats to revoke TV broadcast licenses as an “attempt to stifle dissent” and Trump’s equivocation on political violence as failing the “leadership test” and “making everyone less safe.”\n\nIn a recent news conference he attacked Vice President JD Vance — a potential Republican nominee in 2028 — over the White House’s efforts to stop emergency food aid to states amid the federal government’s shutdown.\n\nMany of Shapiro’s would-be competitors in a Democratic primary won’t have to run for office before then. \n\nNewsom is term-limited, for instance. Others — like ex-Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg — aren’t in public office. A couple other governors in the 2028 conversation — Moore and Pritzker — are running for reelection this year.\n\nFollow Marc Levy at http://twitter.com/timelywriter","url":"https://apnews.com/article/josh-shapiro-governor-pennsylvania-campaign-election-c47c554593ab5087169779ffe2360f28","image":"https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/554e4a3/2147483647/strip/false/crop/5883x3922+0+0/resize/1486x991!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fb9%2Fc3%2F69622bd08b4645db00c6ddf85f89%2F0acbe9736807433582fe9ae7d0c1ad70","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-08 05:02:03","author":"Marc Levy","authors":["Marc Levy"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.299},{"id":391871290,"title":"'Cocksure boor' Trump's disastrous gamble predicted in long-forgotten memoir","text":"Foreign leaders seeking to cope with Donald Trump should not shower the U.S. president with flattery and gold gifts, a former British defense secretary said: they should read a near-forgotten 1991 book that describes Trump as a “cocksure boor who pays precious little attention to detail” and a “a lad who literally grew too big for his britches.”\n\n“You only have to meet people, do the job, read the room to realize that sucking up to Donald Trump, giving him gold watches from Switzerland, doesn't work,” said Sir Ben Wallace, British defense secretary from 2019 to 2023, referring to a common tactic among world leaders regarding the U.S. president. \n\n“There's an amazing book called Trumped! written in 1991 by one of his casino bosses from Atlantic City. It's one of the best reads you can read, because it's not written [as] a sort of kiss-and-tell, ‘I knew the president.’ \n\n“… And in there, right in the middle of it, is Trump's obsession with wearing a suit, for example. It goes way back, right? If we'd had good quality advice to people like Zelensky, we would have known that those are the sort of things that touch [Trump] off.”\n\nSpeaking on the One Decision podcast, which he co-hosts, Wallace was referring to an incident in February last year when Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky was harangued in the Oval Office by Trump and Vice President JD Vance, in part for not wearing a suit as he sought continued U.S. aid against Russian invaders.\n\nA year on, the U.K. is among countries attempting to cope with Trump in the aftermath of a U.S. raid on Caracas that resulted in the seizure and removal of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, and amid Trump’s renewed threats to forcibly take Greenland, which is governed by Denmark, another NATO member.\n\nTrumped! The Inside Story of the Real Donald Trump — His Cunning Rise and Spectacular Fall, by John R. O’Donnell, was published in 1991, when Trump was a New York property magnate subject to high-profile business reverses. \n\nFew then predicted a Trump presidency, let alone a concerted attempt to wreck the post-war international order.\n\nO’Donnell’s portrait is not flattering, revealing now familiar character traits including germaphobia, crudity, racism and cheapness.\n\nOne contemporary review described an “evenhanded, knowledgeable account” of “a decidedly dull boy whose life story could as easily have been subtitled ‘The Banality of Narcissism.’” \n\nKirkus continued: “Trump emerges as a cocksure boor who pays precious little attention to detail and pins the blame for his own misjudgments on subordinates. While he seems surprisingly dumb when it comes to weighing a deal's downside risks against its potential rewards, he apparently suffers from near-terminal overconfidence.”\n\nWallace’s podcast conversation touched on similar themes. \n\nSpeaking to Wallace and co-host Kate McCann, a reporter, Philip Gordon, once national security adviser to former vice president Kamala Harris, said he had “sympathy for the dilemmas of the European situation. \n\n“They are dependent on the United States. They're worried about Trump retribution. They're pleading with him to try to stand with them on Ukraine because they fear that without the United States, they're really vulnerable to Russia and not strong enough.\n\n“They're divided. You have some countries willing and ready to really criticize the United States for violating international law and others not. So I understand it and I get it. But the bottom line is, yes, Europe looks irrelevant in this situation. Collectively, I think this has been a trend in the first year of Trump foreign policy.\n\n“Europeans trying to preserve support from the United States through flattery and nice words for Trump and hoping that if they're nice to him and they don't offend him, he'll support them. And each time he just responds to that, again, with contempt.”\n\nGordon also discussed working for President Barack Obama, who he said “was often accused of thinking things through too much.\n\n“We [thought] about Syria and he would be, second-order effect, third-order, fourth. And … in high levels of government, you can be paralyzed if you worry about everything that could happen because lots of things can happen and you have to be sometimes decisive and take risks. \n\n“But if Obama was guilty of thinking a little bit too much about second-, third- and fourth-order effects, Trump is guilty of not seeming to think about them at all.\n\n“And I think that's what this is in Venezuela. Even when he first started saying, ‘Maduro has to go, we're putting an armada in place,’ I don't think he … was inclined to intervene. And then Maduro pissed him off by dancing and rejecting him and making fun of him and he decided to do it. I think that's where we are now too. But that's the big risk: they don't have a good answer to what next if Plan A doesn't work.”\n\nOn Capitol Hill on Wednesday, Democratic senators told Raw Story they feared such an outcome in Venezuela, for now still led by the Maduro regime, if without its figurehead.\n\nAccording to Gordon, Trump’s Plan A “is to hope that, Okay, they got Maduro, maybe his cronies will be so afraid of the next wave of intervention that they'll do a deal and they'll pay back U.S. oil majors for money they owe them, they'll give them opportunities to invest in Venezuela, and they'll, as Trump says, do what he says.\n\n“So that's the best-case scenario, but the worst case and arguably even more likely case is that they don't … you have the security services, the corrupt ministers of defense and interior, the gangs, the Cubans, the Russians, the Chinese, and they will have every interest in not doing that.\n\n“And I don't think Trump has an answer to that question … Because, we're not there. When Trump says we're running Venezuela, we're not because we're not there. It's all just based on the hope that the fear of Donald Trump will lead them to do our bidding. That's just really risky.\n\n“… If Plan A doesn't work, I don't think he knows what Plan B is. And if Plan B is to have to use force and actually go into Venezuela and do this ourselves, then we run into the same sorts of post-regime challenges that we've seen in places like Afghanistan and Iraq and Libya, and it usually doesn't go well for the United States.”","summary":"Foreign leaders seeking to cope with Donald Trump should not shower the U.S. president with flattery and gold gifts, a former British defense secretary said: they should read a near-forgotten 1991 book that describes Trump as a “cocksure boor who pays precious little attention to detail” and a “a lad who literally grew too big for his britches.”\n\n“You only have to meet people, do the job, read the room to realize that sucking up to Donald Trump, giving him gold watches from Switzerland, doesn't work,” said Sir Ben Wallace, British defense secretary from 2019 to 2023, referring to a common tactic among world leaders regarding the U.S. president. \n\n“There's an amazing book called Trumped! written in 1991 by one of his casino bosses from Atlantic City.

Where would we be right now? Well, we’d be in a very different country, and many of us might very well be in cells. You’ve got a lot of black-pilling from people on our side that not enough people have been arrested, or the administration is moving too slowly on their particular obsession, or that everything isn’t perfect, which means everything is wrong. There’s some truth to that, because we can always do better, but we cannot forget that divine Providence has smiled upon us. We didn’t dodge a bullet. We dodged an 18-inch shell from the USS Kamala.\n\nWe got so damn lucky, and even as we continue to press the Republicans to do more, more, more, and more faster, faster, faster, and faster, we should never forget that.\n\nIf that clinical moron had won the presidency, she probably would’ve won the House, too. So, let’s assume we kept the Senate, and let’s assume we also kept the same set of tofu-spined senators who have only been kept in line by the unholy terror Donald Trump wields upon them like a whip and a chair. With him out of the picture – more about how he’d be out of the picture in federal prison for a decade or so below – these losers would’ve been encouraged to let their failure flag fly. It would be nerds gone wild as helpful Republicans would reach across the aisle to help Democrats complete their conversion of America into communist chaos. And as they did, those useless GOP collaborators would tell themselves that they were the adults in the room, but more on Epstein later.\n\nDonald Trump shut down the border on day one. The exact opposite would’ve happened if he had lost. Instead of a couple of million aliens being self-deported or having deportation thrust upon them, we would have added three, four, or even more millions more. As you recall, the Democrat and GOP traitor party line was that it was absolutely impossible to close down the border except by signing onto Senator Jiminy Lankford’s magic beans deal that would lock in huge rates of Third World peasant immigration forever. And we wouldn’t have even gotten the magic beans under Kamala. She would have laid out the welcome mat and thrown the doors back open as part of Operation Great Replacement. You don’t need to struggle to guess who would be the ones being replaced.\n\nUp in Minnesota, the Learing Centers would have vastly expanded. One of Kamala Harris’s promises was to take this childcare scam and increase it exponentially. Remember that the Democrats aren’t against fraud. That’s like J.B. Pritzker being against carbohydrates or Tim Walz being against show tunes. And forget DOGE. Every transsexual Ecuadorian with a mime troupe and a bank account would still be getting USAID money. Plus, you would still be subsidizing the Volvo Bolsheviks’ NPR habit. And the Green New Deal? Stacy Abrams would have gotten her $2 billion, but that probably wouldn’t have stopped her from being appointed as the new FBI director (and being confirmed with invertebrate Republican votes). After all, she checks all the boxes – she’s not a person of pallor, she’s female (though, sadly, she was apparently born that way), she’s a communist, and she’s fat. The entire administration would be filled with DEI people who lucked into their jobs by winning the intersectional bingo game. A Kamala Harris administration would have been a jobs program for dumb people who are as loud as they are mediocre.\n\nWhat would the Heels-in-the-Air administration be doing? Not releasing the Epstein files, because nobody would care. There would be nothing in it for lol-bertarian Thomas Massie, so that he wouldn’t have stuck Republicans in the back with it – he would have found something else to stick Republicans in the back with. Of course, the Democrats weren’t going to release it for the same reason they didn’t release it when Joe Biden didn’t release it – there’s nothing in there that trashes Trump, though there’s a lot in there that trashes Democrats.\n\nWhat they would be doing is prosecuting Republicans, and not a little bit. All the J6 defendants whose civil rights were treated like an Insane Clown Posse concert porta-potty after a Juggalo chili cook-off would still be rotting in prison for the crime of actually showing up in the People’s House thinking they had rights. But the real story would be Donald Trump. He would absolutely be convicted in Washington by a jury that voted 95% against him and judges that voted 100% against him on the charges that, like in New York, had never been filed against anybody else before. The New York judge would’ve sent him to prison. The Atlanta thing would still be going on, and the federal jury would’ve convicted him, though he was absolutely being framed. They would’ve sent him to federal prison, his crime being that he beat the Democrat establishment and dared to try to give voice to the useful and patriotic half of America.\n\nAnd they would not have stopped with the ex-president. All of us who refused to comply would be targets. The framing would’ve gone into high gear and spread to other Republicans. Everybody and his brother with an (R) after his name, except for the compliant collaborators, would have been charged with seditious conspiracy for pointing out an obviously fraudulent election, then dragged in front of the corrupt DC bench and juries to be framed. \n\nTheir goal would be to eliminate any possibility of an effective Republican Party and an effective resistance, and the shameful thing is that some members of the GOP would be eager to help. After all, while we have cleaned up our roster, too many Republican elected officials are much more comfortable taking scraps from the table from their Democrat masters than actually standing up and fighting back against the destruction of our country.\n\nThe destruction of our country would’ve continued apace. Under Trump, the amazing Harmeet Dhillon has personally led the 180° turn by the Department of Justice in the prosecution of civil rights violations by actually recognizing that it is wrong to violate the rights of white Americans and males. The heart of wokeness is barely beating now; if Harris had won, it would’ve gotten 10 cc of epinephrine stat and been shocked with the defibrillator paddles. Recently, JD Vance noted that Americans no longer have to apologize for being white; under the venomous race communist government of Kamala Harris, you would’ve had to plead “not guilty” for your pale perfidy.\n\nMake no mistake. They would’ve been coming for your guns, and they would’ve been coming for your boy’s penis, as perverted deviants would have made bizarre, transsexual indoctrination mandatory and its criticism forbidden. Say goodbye to the right to say what you think. Look at Europe and how they’re arresting people for the crime of speaking. Have you noticed how none of Kamala’s friends are standing up for free speech today? That’s because they’re against it. They actively believe it would be a good thing if they could toss you in jail for saying stuff, and they absolutely would, given the opportunity. Oh, they would’ve called it “hate speech” or “misinformation” or labeled it some other way to make their tyranny seem benign, but we know their game. It’s the same game dictators always play. They want you disarmed, disenfranchised, and disinclined even to attempt to exercise what had formerly been your right to participate in your own governance.\n\nDon’t even get me started on what they’d be doing to your church. They would not have been satisfied with taking away its nonprofit status. They would’ve actively interfered with the teachings, forcing the faithful to adopt the moral paradigm of some SSRI-ridden, Chardonnay-gulping wine woman who reads books with names like “Where the Sea Urchin Dreams of Me Abandoning My Family So I Can Find Myself.”\n\nMaduro would still be in power, and the Delta Force would be 50% Muslim transwomen of color who are differently abled and fat. Our military would still be in a recruiting crisis, as normal people would refuse to dive headfirst into a bubbling cauldron of social pathologies. Our generals would look like they belonged in a Columbia faculty lounge as they continued their record of zero major wars won unequivocally in the prior 30 years. If Putin hadn’t already won the Ukraine War, he certainly would be closing in on it. Europe would get a free pass on carrying its weight, just like it got for 80 years until Trump came along and told them to stop being freeloaders. Iran would still have its nukes. Drug boats would still be doing their Miami Vice act, heading north unmolested. Your kids would still be dying from fentanyl at record rates.\n\nAs for Israel, Harris would’ve abandoned it. It’s just too Jewish for her coalition. Half the Democrat Party denies the Holocaust anyway, so denying a new one would barely be a stretch. At least Candace Owens would have something to be happy about.\n\nAnd yes, conservative figures would still be murdered. After all, it would be hard to frame them all, so the compliant regime media would eagerly villainize them so that the perverted weirdos who have gone on their killing sprees would accelerate the process under a Harris administration, knowing that a Department of Justice under Leticia James would’ve been as eager to find the killers of conservatives as Biden’s was to find the RNC/DNC bomber.\n\nThat’s all horrific, but here comes the scary part. America would never go down without a fight. I write about it in my new novel, Panama Red, where America has broken into red and blue halves after the left pushes way too far, way too hard, and way too fast. That’s the thing about the left – they don’t understand human nature, they’re greedy, and, above all, they’re ahistorical and stupid. They don’t understand what all these things I’ve discussed would do. They believe that our society is a Jenga tower from which they can pull blocks endlessly, and yet it will somehow still stand erect. They think that the status quo will endure even as they change key elements of the paradigm. They don’t understand that what we have here is a system with duties and obligations, and if you decide that you’re not going to honor your obligations or duties, you don’t get a free pass to enjoy the fruits of the system. The system collapses. It doesn’t just keep functioning as everybody goes along, like you didn’t change anything. \n\nWould we have resistance? Yes, there would be political resistance in the alternative media and at the ballot box, which they would attempt to suppress using a weaponized federal government because that’s how communists keep power. But Americans are an ornery people, not a neutered continent of eunuchs whose ancestors weren’t man enough to jump on a ship sailing west. The resistance would start being political, but as the Democrats redacted more and more of our Constitution in an effort to keep power in perpetuity, the resistance would rise, and their repression would rise in response. Would we be in a civil war one year on? No, but we would sure as hell be headed there.\n\nBut it’s not going to happen, so stop your doomin’. \n\nThe good Lord apparently looks after drunks and Americans, because the election of Donald Trump saved our country as we know it. Now, don’t quit complaining and whining. Being loud and annoying is important. You’ve got to keep the pressure on, because there are a lot of Republicans who would be happy to glide along until that mean Donald Trump goes away and they can get back to the business of walking around like a bunch of puffed-up popinjays being addressed as “Congressman” and “Senator” instead of actually having to do things and endure the Washington Post being mean to them. Never stop demanding more. Never quit pointing out bad ideas and the slow-walking of important reforms. Just understand the reality of the situation, that everything that we want can’t happen all at once. We’ve got three more glorious years to go, and you should be on your knees thanking God for it.\n\nOrder Kurt Schlichter’s BRAND NEW bestseller in the Kelly Turnbull People’s Republic conservative action series, \"Panama Red,\" and follow Kurt on Twitter @KurtSchlichter.\n\nEditor's Note: Join the fight for America by enlisting in Townhall VIP right now.

The alleged fraud involving day care centers and allegations that federal aid went to outside entities, including China and East Africa, apparently forced his decision.\n\nA trial opened this week in Mississippi, where it is alleged several nonprofits fraudulently re-directed $77 million in federal money to enrich themselves.\n\nWe regularly hear complaints of \"waste, fraud and abuse\" in Washington. Politicians make promises to root it out. Rarely do they follow through.\n\nFraud usually makes headlines only when the amount exceeds the lottery. In the matter of the alleged fraudulent spending on phony day care centers in Minnesota - at least $9 billion, though Trump claimed $18 billion in his New Year's Eve speech at Mar-a-Lago- the amount was impossible to ignore. It took a 23-year-old YouTube video creator, not the mainstream media, to attempt it, though many Somali daycare operators refute many of the claims in the 12-minute video and call them misleading. Still, Trump claims Illinois, California and New York are \"even worse.\"\n\nA 2012 audit by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) discovered $16 million in \"improper\" childcare payments to Minnesota, but money continued to flow to the state.\n\nHHS is finally tightening requirements for payments from the program known as the Administration for Children to every state and requiring justification and a receipt or photo evidence for proper expenditures. Isn't that what employers in the private sector require when expense forms are submitted?\n\nQuestion: What took them so long? Answer: It isn't their money.\n\nPresident Trump says the fraud in Minnesota is only the \"tip of the iceberg.\" Yes, and unless it and all unnecessary federal spending is eliminated, the government will resemble the Titanic, sinking into a deeper ocean of debt that will lead to unpleasant and potentially catastrophic consequences.\n\nI see only three ways to correct this. The first is to elect people to Congress who are serious about addressing wasteful government spending. That is unlikely to happen because too many people want to maintain their government benefits and don't seem to care about their effect on the country. Politicians are happy to dispense money to continue many voters' addiction to government and their own re-elections.\n\nThe second way is a Convention of States that would amend the Constitution to require a balanced budget except in extraordinary circumstances (such as war or a 9/11-type terrorist attack). So far, 19 of the necessary 34 states have approved a convention resolution. Others are in the process of considering the Article V constitutional provision.\n\nA third way would get the attention of politicians more than anything else - and one which admittedly is a fantasy - is an income tax rebellion. America has seen many rebellions that forced leaders to act, even preceding July 4, 1776. Suppose large numbers of Americans decided to stop paying federal income taxes until politicians stop wasting the money we earn?\n\nRebellions in America go back to colonial uprisings. Bacon's Rebellion (1676) protested high taxes, among other things. This was followed by the Stono Rebellion (1739), the largest slave revolt in the British mainland colonies. Shays's Rebellion (1786-87), which protested the government's increased efforts to collect taxes amid a debt crisis. The Whiskey Rebellion (1791-94) railed against taxes. Later conflicts included Nat Turner's Rebellion (1831) against slavery and the worker and civil rights movements and anti-Vietnam War protests in the 1960s.\n\nIf millions of Americans refuse to pay their federal income taxes until Congress ends wasteful and fraudulent spending and creates a mechanism that will substantially reduce it in the future, withholding money from Washington might force government to put the country ahead of its own interests. Again, it's just a fantasy and is unlikely to happen, but it would be entertaining to watch politicians squirm when the revenue spigot is turned off.\n\nAmerica could use another rebellion. The Preamble to the U.S. Constitution begins \"We the people,\" not them the government. Perhaps Bob Dylan could write a protest song that would serve as the anthem.\n\nReaders may email Cal Thomas at tcaeditors@tribpub.com.

Ed. Thurman (Tee) Watts, Joyce Rages. Publisher: Aquarius Press. Releasing February 2026.\n\nThe Scribes of Heru Writers’ Collective is a group of seven writers from diverse backgrounds, who collaborate to preserve and honor African-American cultural heritage by highlighting through writing, the experiences (and vast contributions) of necessary figures in African-American culture. I first became acquainted with Thurman (Tee) Watts through his writing in the famed anthology Black Fire This Time and later, with the first Scribes of Heru anthology, which deservedly won the 2024 International Book Award for Best African American Fiction (and was finalist in the Anthology category too).\n\nWith my mother from Egypt, I was drawn to the group’s homage to Heru (formerly Horus) the Egyptian god of many things, not least for protection and the ‘scribes’ devotion to writing erased or maligned African-American histories. The Scribes of Heru Writers’ Collective comprise of: Jacqueline Elizabeth, Alan Laird, David Rages, Joyce Rages, Bill Summers, Rickey Vincent, and Thurman (Tee) Watts.\n\nExploring the multi-faceted themes of losing a mother in childhood, Jacueline Elizabeth’s writing deeply stirs the readers’ empathy through close character development and rich evocative voices. Her work considers the universal question: “Do we choose who we become, or do our formative experiences choose for us?” Later writing: “I will never forget it because this is when I lost forever my vision of the world that included having a mother in it.”\n\nIn her short story – Margaret: the Matriarch’s Daughter, she writes: “The Hill seemed to have for the innocence of youth, especially girls. I often wondered if it was like this everywhere. With joy and pain living in the same place” Elizabeth’s writing is not so much nostalgic as factual with a slice of beauty and pain. She doesn’t flinch from truth, but her varnish is sweet. Consequently, reading her is like reading thoughts in your own mind, turned over in warm sun. She also says a lot in a little space, which is a gift in its own right.\n\nWriter Alan Laird says he was “taught to laugh at the contrived stereotypes of the Negro, creating myths that assisted in the dismantling of community.” When he writes using the vernacular and cadence of African-American communities of his childhood, he does so with affection and truism to the cultural ‘voice’ that is slowly being blunted through time. In Daily Dagg Nabbitts, Laird echoes such refrains in humorous and sorrowful observations: “HOLY MOLEY. I knew I had been forgettin’ sumptin. I had been without shoes so long working in the fields I forgot I didn’t have shoes on. All I could do was reach and pick, reach and pick. I sho duz thank ya my friend. I got feet again!”\n\nThe voice he conjures, is authentic and reminiscent of his ancestors, not the curated versions appropriated by Hollywood or white producers. As he says; “one flag cannot be bigger than the hands that make it. A flag is only a symbol of group consciousness.” By this, he reclaims his people, even as his main protagonist is “temporary activated dust.” There is a wry humor, honesty and dualism in these metaphors, such as the idea that in a man’s life “The who in him was invisible to them.” Laird knows how to evolve a spiritual question of belonging to a physical reality through his observations: “but be careful, dem city slickers in town might just make a wind-up toy of you, and you might find yo self sitting by dat rolling river without a songbird to lead you back home.” It’s never as simple as a historical reenactment, it’s like the ancestors are at the table with Laird.\n\nWriter David Rages spent a significant portion of his life supporting at-risk children and preserving the Black family in his activism and work. He writes in The Arkansas Dog Tales that: “Mama explained that those white men came around here every so often to kill dogs that were a threat to their livestock.” This metaphor about what is recognized and valued versus what is not (the black man) has such a soft horror to it, without needing to be blunt in its message, we know what the dog represents and how “Sorry to say, the men couldn’t tell the difference.” And by this, we mean the white men who judged such circumstance.\n\nIn his story Eating With the Dogs, this idea of undervaluing and mistreatment (like an animal) is furthered, where he writes of his character: “He didn’t always understand what he was singing himself. All he knew was that he felt good after singing and moaning.” The fervor and beauty of such music (a theme that runs in all Scribes of Heru books and within their community, as so many of the members are musicians or worked in this world) is the lighthearted vein in an otherwise unsettling story of child-abuse, when the character Cora says: “It started when I was a little girl. Mama and Daddy used to leave me home alone while they went to town. Them old mens would know I was home alone and come out looking for me.”\n\nReminiscent of the histories of sexual abuse and exploitation among African-American communities by outsiders and insiders alike, borne of despair, poverty and rage, this feeling is furthered in Rages poem ‘Go Back and Get It’ where he writes:\n\nI saw the ancestors as I watched Sankofa.\n\nThey were sitting right there,\n\nthere on the sofa.\n\nThey said not a word,\n\nReminding us, it is often the things unsaid in Rages writing that have the most lingering and devastating power and impact.\n\nJoyce Rages (wife of David and an equal talent) had a longing to always “keep alive the stories she grew up hearing, ensuring that her people’s romances, struggles, and triumphs are remembered.” She evokes this passion time-and-again, including in the story Trouble Always Knocks, where she writes: “I member when we come out from Mississippi. Us slaves marched wid the Chickasaws. I was still a boy, but I member a white man on horseback leadin’ the line of a couple of hunerd cuffed slaves, mens and boys. Den more white mens with guns and whips followed. Behind the mens, bout a hunerd womens and girls carried small chirens, some were tied with rope. Da food and da folks unable to keep up was in da wagon. A lots of people died, Indians and slaves.”\n\nRages historical acumen and the parts of history that are often over-looked or undeveloped, are her specialty and she’s able to render realistic and historically accurate accounts of the unique times between African-American slaves and Native-American tribes. Of one key character she writes: “Although she was granted her freedom in 1866 when the Chickasaw entered into treaties with the United States government abolishing slavery, it took several years for her owner to acknowledge her emancipation.” Snippets of history like this, where a person’s worth is ignored by people who hold them no respect, touches intensely on the dehumanization of slavers and the devastating impact this had on slaves’ sense of safety. As her character Nero says: “But here, dey can take me away from you when I ain’t done nothin wrong.”\n\nRepeatedly he loses rights he never really had to begin with, set in a tale of love and heartbreak in post-slavery Oklahoma. This is a heart wrenching story but moreover, it’s based upon Rages actual family history and done with the sensitivity and nuance you’d expect of a master historian.\n\nWriter Bill Summers utilizes lovely art to bring his stories to life. His goal, to share his knowledge with the next generation of artists. In his short story Segun, The Drummer Boy, his character is told: “My son. When you take from Mother Nature, she expects you to leave something in return” – and Segun learns he is far more than “just a little boy looking for a small piece of wood for a drum.” This fable is both a moral story and a fairytale as well as being a story of African life. Segun is at once: “a great man in a boy’s body. Your voice shall speak for many.” And his journey culminates in learning, the only way you can help others is if you have “given a piece of yourself.”\n\nEssayist Rickey Vincent writes about Revisiting Donald Warden’s Afro-American Association in relation to Kamala Harris’s parents. “In 2020, when former Vice President Kamala Harris first announced her run for President, The New York Times carried a story about the origins of her family.” This in-depth consideration of Donald Warden walks through history to remind us of the first African-American social-movements, particularly in academic-settings.\n\n“Facing the withering isolation on the UC Berkeley campus of over 20,000 with a black population of no more than a hundred, the close-knit group of a dozen graduate students regularly met.”\n\nVincent concurs with Donald Warden’s conclusion that: “There is no place called Negroland.” As such, this explains why African-American’s rejected the descriptive ‘Negro’ because as the Chinese are from China, American Blacks identify through their African-American reality. Vincent discusses the origins of the Black Panther Party, where: “Both Huey Newton and Bobby Seale would go on to create the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense in 1966. While they critiqued Warden’s brand of black nationalism, and what they called his “opportunism,” the two eventual icons of the Black Revolution were undoubtedly influenced by Warden’s focus on black self-determination, which one affirmed by doing, rather than merely speaking or writing.”\n\nThis historical journey isn’t solely about Warden but considers him in light of his relative obscurity, given his immense success and stature in the African-American social-movement. Vincent concludes: “The main line of “our heroes” has been strip-mined clean, but out of the spotlight is where the lion’s share of the work has always been done. Many people with insights and accomplishments worthy of study by later generations can be found, hidden in plain sight.”\n\nThurman (Tee) Watts rounds out the collection with his homage to singer/musician Sugar Pie DeSanto, as well as his Black Augusts poem, deliberately ignoring capitalization to strike home a point, where Watts inhabits the voice of dead African-American’s whose blood is in the soil we walk upon today:\n\nthe blood also spilled in sad septembers ago\n\nas nina wailed mississippi got damn yo flow\n\nlangston knew the waters were sullied so when stars fell in alabama\n\ncoltrane hit that lick\n\nIn On The road with Sugar, Watts shares his recollections and writings of this magnificent singer and personality, who outlasted many of her contemporaries, with her magnetism and drive for life. He shares one of her memories in Sugar Pie DiSanto Unsquared, with the reader: “We were driving through town, doing about 25 or 30 miles an hour. The sheriff pulled us over and said we were doing 55. In those days, my complexion was lighter than it is now, and my hair was down to the bend in my knee. They thought I was a white woman! They arrested both of us. They released me, but held Pee Wee on bogus white slavery charges for two days.”\n\nAgain, it’s what isn’t said (implicit racism based upon skin color and perceived ethnicity) something many of us can understand too well (my mother was once stopped in France by the police for ‘taking a white child’ who was her own child (me)). The ideas of others become the prejudice foisted on people of color time-and-again. Watts recalls: “Sugar Pie and I head back to Dressing Room B. When I glance back at corn-fed and the young republicans, they are snarling and red like the KKK. I guess that’s why they wear sheets when they can.”\n\nThis collection brings back both grief, loss, suffering AND joy in a kaleidoscopic homage to African-American histories, both personal and universal. It retains the unforgettable voice of its predecessor, in its dedication to truth and real voices, where we learn of characters like: “Ms. Sugar Pie DeSanto, who Queen of Soul Aretha Franklin loves so much that she has had The Sugar perform twice recently at her annual Christmas party.” For those of us who didn’t meet the Queen of the West Coast Blues, and watch her do her famous blackflip, or hear our ancestors stories of being part of the Trail of Tears, The Scribes of Heru Vol. ll is the most immediate and authentic opportunity to serve a slice of African-American life, and cherish what holds us together most; our stories.\n\nCandice Louisa Daquin, Managing Editor, Lit Fox Books, author, The Cruelty.","url":"https://countercurrents.org/2026/01/preserving-what-was-erased-the-scribes-of-heru-return-with-a-powerful-tapestry-of-african-american-memory/","image":"https://cdn.countercurrents.org/2026/01/The-Best-of-The-Scribes-of-Heru.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-08 03:21:44","author":"Candice Louisa Daquin","authors":["Candice Louisa Daquin"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.519},{"id":391858280,"title":"Democrats Are Getting Ahead of Themselves and So Is the Media (Update: AOC Calls It Murder)","text":"As David wrote here, the shooting in Minneapolis this afternoon was witnessed by a bunch of people and captured on video from at least 3 angles. What seems clear from the video is that the driver was trying to flee ICE who had demanded she get out of the car. Instead she rolled back and then put the car in gear and accelerated toward an agent directly in front of her. In fact, it looks like the car actually came into contact with the ICE agent.\n\nIn a post on X, Kurt Schlichter argues this looks like a classic case of an ICE agent responding to a threat of deadly force.\n\nA DEEP DIVE -- Thoughts From a Competent Lawyer on the Minneapolis ICE Shooting:1.

The law is clear – you can use deadly force against someone threatening you with deadly force. The ICE agent had no duty to retreat. This does not matter to the left and its narrative. You will see many experts with zero actual knowledge of the law opining – including the typically terrible cadre of leftist lawyers.4. The video is clear that the driver was heading at and came in contact with the ICE agent. He had a right to use deadly force to defend himself. This does not matter to the left and its narrative. The left will do everything it can to keep people from looking at the actual video that shows the incident. It will push video that does not show the incident clearly, as well a perjured or irrelevant witness statements.\n\nSome of that already appears to be happening. The Washington Post is covering this and they have published a witness statement that is at odds with their own reporting.\n\nLynette Reini-Grandell, a retired community college English professor, said she was volunteering as an ICE observer Wednesday morning near her home in south Minneapolis when she witnessed the events surrounding the shooting and filmed the aftermath...“There were no ICE vehicles in front of it and there were no ICE officers in front of her,” Reini-Grandell said of the shooting victim. “I believe she was trying to leave.”\n\nThe same \"Live Updates\" vertical posted this description of videos of the shooting earlier on:\n\nVideos that surfaced immediately after the shooting show the woman’s vehicle, a burgundy Honda Pilot SUV, stopped in the middle of the road across travel lanes with the driver-side window rolled down. They do not show the events leading up to that moment.Two ICE agents pulled up, exited their vehicle and approached the SUV. The vehicle began to reverse, and one of the agents reached out and held on to the door handle. As the SUV moved out of reverse and drove forward, a third ICE agent, positioned closer to the front of the car, quickly drew his service weapon and fired three times.That third agent appears, in the video, to have been in front of the vehicle when it began advancing and to have been beside it by the time of the last shots.\n\nThose two updates are attributed to two different reporters but it's odd that the Post would publish a false eyewitness account after its own, more accurate, description of the video. What is the point of that exactly?\n\nThe Post is also highlighting this claim by Sen. Tina Smith that the Homeland Security description of what happened doesn't match the video. In what way? She doesn't bother to say.\n\nHomeland Security’s description of what happened and the narrative they’re pushing clearly doesn’t match up with the videos we’re all seeing.

The ICE officers who were hurt are expected to make full recoveries. This is the direct consequence of constant attacks and demonization of our officers by sanctuary politicians who fuel and encourage rampant assaults on our law enforcement who are facing 1,300% increase in assaults against them and an 8,000% increase in death threats. This is an evolving situation, and we will give the public more information as soon as it becomes available.\n\nI agree with David that the video doesn't show this was domestic terrorism as I don't think you can prove intent to commit political violence based on this. My take is that the driver probably didn't intended to kill anyone. It looks to me like she panicked and tried to flee rather than obeying the orders of the agents telling her to get out of the car. But other than that dispute about intent, the statement seems accurate about what happened. The vehicle became a weapon when it was put in gear and driven directly at an agent.\n\nIf you watch a slowed down version of the video, you can see the agent didn't even draw his weapon until the car lurched forward at him. \n\nWhy don’t you post the video? Oh right, it would destroy your narrative.pic.twitter.com/iER0hYO5xS— Paul A. Szypula 🇺🇸 (@Bubblebathgirl) January 7, 2026\n\nIn other words, it looks like a justifiable shooting. It's still a sad outcome and people are right to think it didn't have to end this way, but the fault was likely her own. Put another way, if the driver had stopped the car as agents demanded instead of trying recklessly to escape, no one would have been hurt.\n\nAll that to say, I think Democrats and the media are getting out over their skis on this pretty quickly. It's fine to call for an investigation but suggesting the driver in this case was an innocent victim of the Trump administration is taking it too far. The federal agents had a right to be there and the driver, who was apparently there as a legal observer, should have obeyed their orders.\n\nUpdate: Here's AOC proclaiming this was a cold-blooded murder.\n\nAOC: This has now become what we feared most about ICE for a long time—that it would be used as an anti-civilian force with no accountability.

She responded by saying she keeps her distance from political matters.“To be honest with you, I stay out of politics completely.

Kristin Robbins, Walter Hudson, Marion Rarick, and former Department of Justice special counsel Brendan Ballou. \n\nThe issue heated up in recent months when President Donald Trump announced in a TruthSocial post that he was terminating temporary protected status for Somalis in the state. The president’s move came after a City Journal report alleged millions of Minnesota taxpayer dollars were stolen in the fraud scheme and were funneled to the Somali-based al-Shabaab terrorist group.\n\nThe scandal has subsequently taken on a life of its own thanks to a video by YouTuber Nick Shirley, which went viral. The issue has opened heated debates between Republicans and Democrats both in and out of a hearing room, with Trump and some GOP lawmakers calling for investigations into other blue states, such as California, while some Democrats are accusing Republicans of engaging in racist behavior. \n\nThe committee has called on state officials to testify in closed-door, transcribed interviews, while requesting suspicious activity reports from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, along with a staff-level briefing from the Justice Department. \n\nThe committee also expects a second hearing on Feb. 10, at which Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-KY) has invited Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN) and Attorney General Keith Ellison to testify. \n\nGOP witnesses point fingers at Walz administration\n\nRepublicans in the hearing largely targeted Walz and his leadership, placing blame for the fraud occurring under his watch.\n\n“If Governor Walz was serious about stopping fraud, he would have done it in 2019 when he took office,” Rarick, who has served in the state House since 2013, said in the hearing.\n\nWhen Rep. Brandon Gill (R-TX) asked if the governor knew about the fraud, Robbins claimed Walz knew about it from the “very beginning” and “did nothing.”\n\nRepublican witnesses have claimed whistleblowers have been retaliated against, saying they were told they could be “demoted or reassigned or told that they could lose their job and then their house or their pension or their retirement benefits, or not qualify for unemployment benefits,” Robbins said in the hearing. \n\nThe alleged fraud, of which the majority of those charged are Somali immigrants, targeted multiple government social services programs in Minnesota under Walz’s leadership, with federal prosecutors saying billions of taxpayer dollars could have been stolen.\n\n“From food nutrition assistance meant for children to fake autism centers and empty daycares – Tim Walz and Keith Ellison allowed fraudsters to take advantage of hardworking taxpayers at every turn. And now, Walz is running scared,” House Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-MN) said Wednesday ahead of the hearing.Emmer has been a staunch opponent of Walz for some time, whose antagonism for the governor heightened once Walz became the vice presidential running mate to former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.\n\nWalz dropped his reelection bid earlier this week amid the fraud scandal. \n\n“I came to the conclusion that I can’t give a political campaign my all,” Walz said during a press conference Monday, hours after releasing a statement. “Every minute that I spend defending my own political interest would be a minute I can’t spend defending the people of Minnesota against the criminals who prey on our generosity and the cynics who want to prey on our differences.”\n\nGOP and Dems split on partisan lines\n\nWednesday’s hearing was a display of stark partisanship over the fraud, with Republicans pointing their questions at the Somali community and Walz’s administration. At the same time, Democrats focused on alleged fraud coming from the Trump administration.\n\n“What we’re seeing today in the premise of this hearing is selective outrage about fraud,” Rep. James Wilkinshaw (D-VA) said. \n\n“Maybe the Republican majority would be interested in holding a hearing on the $50,000 cash bribe that Border Czar Tom Homan received from FBI undercover agents in a Cava bag,” Rep. Yassamin Ansari (D-AZ) said, sharing a slew of examples of “corruption” in the Trump administration.\n\nMultiple members pointed to the plane gifted to Trump from Qatar, renaming the Kennedy Center, and the ballroom being put in place of the East Wing of the White House when talking about fraud in the administration. \n\nMeanwhile, GOP members slammed the Walz administration for “covering up” the fraud and punishing whistleblowers when bringing concerns forward. \n\n“So you have the Somali community who, on purpose, was petitioning the state of Minnesota to lower the standards, lower the standards to be able to make sure that fraud cannot be caught, is that correct?” Rep. Byron Donalds (R-FL) asked during his allotted time. \n\nOther Republican lawmakers asked questions about whether Somali Americans should speak English or be deported if they were involved in any part of the fraud scandal. \n\n“What percentage of working age Somalians, who have been in the U.S. for 10 years or more, 10 years or more, how many of them speak English very well?” Rep. Brandon Gill (R-TX) asked Ballou. “About half, the answer is about half. That seems pretty low, doesn’t it? Again, that doesn’t sound like something that makes our country stronger to me, and I think most Americans would agree with me on that.” \n\nMinnesota has the highest Somali population of any state in the United States. Many Democrats, including Walz, have criticized the administration’s illegal immigration crackdown and Trump’s move to terminate the temporary protected status of Somalis living in Minnesota.\n\nSparks fly between lawmakers during questioning\n\nThe House Oversight Committee is one of the most well-known committees, known for both its theatrics and major investigations, which often garner significant media attention. This hearing was no different. \n\nThe first tit-for-tat unfolded between the chairman and Rep. Summer Lee (D-PA), as both members yelled about how each respective party has “failed.”\n\nNext was a heated back-and-forth that involved a witness, Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-MA), and Rep. Nancy Mace (R-SC). Mace told Pressley she was “off the rails” after Pressley called the witnesses “hypocrites” for defending pardons made by Trump for a Minnesota Jan. 6 insurrectionist and former Rep. George Santos. \n\nRep. Maxwell Frost (D-FL) asked the GOP witnesses if they agree that a post should be taken down from TruthSocial, posted by Trump, saying, “Did Tim Walz really have (D) Melissa Hortman assassinated???” \n\nHudson responded that he will “not engage in the silly condemnation” and continued on, as Frost began saying he will reclaim his time continuously. Hudson and Frost continued to speak over each other for over 20 seconds before Comer called for “order” and gave Frost a few extra seconds to close his statement.\n\nOmar immigration records become point of tension\n\nThe Oversight Committee tabled a motion from Mace to subpoena Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) to release her immigration records. Omar has been the target of many GOP attacks in recent years.\n\nThe motion from Mace was met with heavy debate from the committee before it voted, as members were unclear whether the panel had the authority to investigate sitting members of Congress. The motion was tabled after ranking member Robert Garcia (D-CA) withdrew a subpoena motion against Rep. Cory Mills (R-FL), who has been accused of a myriad of allegations ranging from domestic abuse to soliciting prostitutes, and substituted it with the motion to table Mace’s.“Tonight Democrats and Republicans teamed up to kill my motion to subpoena the immigration records of Ilhan Omar and her brother/husband,” Mace wrote on X. “DC did what it always does – protect its own. The American people spoke clearly in 2024 – they are tired of business as usual and backroom deals – they want REAL accountability.”\n\nBut this was not the first move to subpoena Omar’s immigration records. \n\n“Today, I am calling on the House Intelligence Committee to subpoena and release the immigration records of Congresswoman Ilhan Omar,” Rep. Tim Burchett (R-TN). “This request was directed towards the Intelligence Committee because the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee is not the correct jurisdiction.”\n\nOmar is a frequent target of Republicans, as the president has referred to her as “garbage” and also said Somalis should “go back to where they came from.”\n\n“America would be a better place if @IlhanMN were deported back to Somalia,” Gill wrote on X last year.\n\nOmar came to the U.S. as a refugee before becoming a naturalized citizen in 2000, at the age of 17.\n\nMIKE JOHNSON TO ADDRESS UK PARLIAMENT AHEAD OF INDEPENDENCE ANNIVERSARY\n\n“Born in Somalia, Rep. Omar and her family fled the country’s civil war when she was eight,” her website reads. “The family spent four years in a refugee camp in Kenya before coming to the United States in the 1990s. In 1997, she moved to Minneapolis with her family.”\n\nThe Washington Examiner reached out to Omar’s office for comment.","summary":"The House Oversight Committee’s first hearing on the Minnesota fraud scandal was complete with lawmakers pointing fingers and exchanging barbs in heated exchanges.&#160; This marked the first hearing into the committee’s investigation into the Minnesota fraud scandal, which was launched late last year.

Renee Nicole Good, 37, was shot and killed in her car by an ICE agent during what DHS has claimed was “an act of domestic terrorism.”\n\nFBI Director Kash Patel’s girlfriend, Alexis Wilkins, weighed in on Rivera’s remarks in a response on X, writing, “Geraldo, she was armed with a CAR.” \n\nThe FBI is the agency partly responsible for conducting an investigation into the fatal shooting, along with the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the shooting, DHS released a statement claiming that “rioters began blocking ICE officers and one of these violent rioters weaponized her vehicle,” which the agency classified as “an act of domestic terrorism.” DHS Secretary Kristi Noem has since reiterated that claim. \n\nThe former Fox personality’s public doubt of the federal government’s narrative comes after Rivera’s tumultuous relationship with President Donald Trump. \n\nRivera and Trump had a decades-long friendship dating back to the 1970s. Rivera said he turned on Trump after the 2020 election when Trump attempted to overturn the results of the election and the subsequent Jan. 6 insurrection attempt. Rivera then endorsed former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nRivera joined numerous others in pointing out that the video footage of the incident directly contradicts DHS’s claims. \n\nVideo footage of the moment leading up to the shooting shows a Honda Pilot, with the driver’s window rolled down, idling in the roadway. \n\nICE agents are seen approaching the vehicle and yelling at the driver to get out of her car. One agent then started pulling the handle of her car door. The driver slowly backs up, turns, and accelerates forward. One ICE agent then fired three gunshots into the vehicle as they stepped out of the way. The car then crashes into a parked car nearby before coming to a stop.\n\nTrump claimed in a Truth Social post that the victim of the fatal shooting “was very disorderly, obstructing and resisting, who then violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer.” He also claimed the agent who shot the woman is “recovering in the hospital.” The agent who shot Good has not been officially identified. \n\nThe president also claimed, without providing evidence, that one bystander was “obviously, a professional agitator,” and claimed “the Radical Left” was the root cause of the incident. \n\nMinneapolis and Minnesota officials have said the incident was “predictable” given ICE agents’ repeated use of violence when it comes to countering protestors and detaining people. They have also sharply refuted the Trump administration’s portrayal of what took place, with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz calling DHS a “propaganda machine” and urging the public not to trust the agency’s account of the situation.","summary":"Roy Rochlin / Getty ImagesA former Fox News host is calling bull on the Trump administration’s justification of an ICE agent killing a U.S. citizen in Minneapolis on Wednesday.\n\nGeraldo Rivera called the Department of Homeland Security’s claim that the shooting was a justified use of deadly force “bullsh--,” given video evidence which suggests otherwise.

Veep, meaning a vice president or second-in-command, is one of them. \n\nFormed from the initials VP for “vice president”, it was first coined in 1949 by Alben Barkley, the Democratic politician who became affectionately known as the Veep when he served under Harry Truman as the 35th vice president of the United States from 1949 to 1953.\n\nLooking back on his life, he recalled how his nickname started: “Everywhere I went people would say, what should we call you? One night I was out at my daughter’s—she had four boys—and the youngest kid says to me, ‘Gramps, why not put two little Es in there between those two big letters and call it VEEP?’” Barkley announced the name to the press corps the next day, and thus veep entered the national lexicon. \n\nJust because someone calls themselves something does not guarantee the success of the word—think Snoop Dogg’s attempt to rename himself Snoop Lion. The word veep may have caught on in the mid-20th century because it was influenced by the sound of another popular term at the time: jeep, a sturdy four-wheel drive army vehicle, named in 1940 after the initials GP for “general purpose”. Veep would have also been helped by the coining in 1952 of veepstakes, a blend of “veep” and “sweepstakes”, to describe the notional competition among politicians to be chosen as a party’s candidate for vice president.\n\nPopularity of the term spiked from 2012 to 2019 because of the success of the American comedy show Veep, which followed the daily political games of a fictional female vice president of the US, Selina Meyer, played by Julia Louis-Dreyfus. The show won several Emmys and inspired countless memes and shitposts when Biden endorsed his veep, Kamala Harris, as the Democratic nominee in 2024. Veep Meyer’s refrain to her PA—“Sue, did the president call?”—became a catch cry for the essence of a veep: a middle-aged woman who is capable of leading the whole organisation but finds herself ignored and kept out of the real power-broking and decision-making—until some unexpected drama happens.

A crowd of people, who appear to be protesting, are lining the sidewalk area.\n\nMultiple law enforcement vehicles appear nearby. Immigration agents pull up to the vehicle parked in the street, get out of the truck and order the woman behind the wheel to get out of the SUV. One of the agents tugs at the driver's side door handle.\n\nAnother agent is positioned near the front of the vehicle. It's not clear exactly where the officer is standing based on the BBC's immediate review of the videos. That agent opens fire as the maroon SUV attempts to drive off.\n\nThree pops are heard, and the vehicle can be seen losing control and crashing into a white car parked along the street nearby.\n\nThe shooting comes amid a major immigration crackdown in Minneapolis by the Trump administration.\n\nUS homeland security secretary Kristi Noem said the deceased woman's actions constituted \"domestic terrorism\" - and that ICE's operations in the city will continue.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social, Trump said that an ICE officer was \"viciously\" run over. \"It is hard to believe he is alive, but is now recovering in the hospital,\" he wrote.\n\nThe president also blamed the \"Radical Left\" for \"threatening, assaulting, and targeting our Law Enforcement Officers and ICE Agents on a daily basis\".\n\nSpeaking to the press later in the day, Noem called the loss of life \"preventable.\n\nBut she repeatedly claimed that the ICE agent fired in self-defence and that Good used her vehicle as a \"deadly weapon\" against agents. The details are pending an FBI investigation, she said, adding that the same agent injured on Wednesday was also hit by a car in the line of duty in June.\n\nThe Minneapolis City Council, however, said that Good was simply \"caring for her neighbours\" when she was shot and killed.\n\nMinnesota State Governor Tim Walz also pushed back on federal accounts of the incident.\n\n\"Don't believe this propaganda machine,\" Walz wrote in response to a Department of Homeland Security post about the shooting. \"The state will ensure there is a full, fair, and expeditious investigation to ensure accountability and justice.\"\n\nTop Democrats, like former Vice President Kamala Harris and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, also released statements Wednesday evening. Harris called the Trump administration's version of events \"gaslighting\".\n\nProtests erupted in several parts of the city as outraged Minneapolis residents condemned the shooting and called for ICE to leave. According to local media reports, the main gathering happened near the scene of the shooting.\n\nA makeshift vigil, displaying flowers and candles, was laid in the snow there, as protesters chanted slogans and delivered speeches.\n\nOne group of protesters formed a line blocking the entrance to a federal courthouse with ICE officers standing inside, according to the Minneapolis Star-Tribune. The group of around 50 people chanted Good's name and dispersed after breaking a glass window.\n\nProtests are also taking place in cities outside Minneapolis, with gatherings expected in New Orleans, Miami, Seattle and New York City.\n\nWhy is ICE in Minneapolis?\n\nThe Trump administration deployed an additional 2,000 federal agents to the Minneapolis area in recent weeks in response to allegations of welfare fraud in the state, sources told the BBC's US partner, CBS News.\n\nFrey said in the press conference Wednesday that ICE is not making the city safer. \"They're ripping families apart, they're sowing chaos in our streets,\" he said.\n\nThe deployment, which began on Sunday, is one of the largest concentrations of Department of Homeland Security personnel in a US city in recent years.\n\nIt follows an immigration enforcement campaign launched by ICE in late 2025 to target individuals in Minneapolis who were issued deportation orders, including members of the city's Somali community.\n\nThat community has been criticised frequently by Trump, who has called them \"garbage\".\n\n\"I don't want them in our country. I'll be honest with you,\" the president has said. \"Their country's no good for a reason. Their country stinks.\"\n\nTrump later doubled-down on his remarks after a YouTube video by a conservative online content creator accused day care centres run by Somali immigrants of fraud.\n\n\"Send them back from where the came,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social in December. He also withheld federal child care funds to the state of Minnesota in response.\n\nThe Trump administration has sent ICE agents to other cities as well, all part of a widespread crackdown on what it says is unlawful immigration in the US.","summary":"A US immigration agent fatally shot a 37-year-old woman on Wednesday in the city of Minneapolis, but the details of what led up to the incident have left a wide chasm between federal and local government officials.

Federal agents, he said, are “sowing chaos on our streets, and in this case, quite literally killing people.”\n\nThe Minnesota Star Tribune identified the woman as 37-year old Renee Nicole Good. Good’s mother, Donna Ganger, told the outlet that her daughter was “loving, forgiving and affectionate” and that she was “probably terrified” during the encounter.\n\nThe incident, coming on the heels of the Trump administration's expanded immigration operations in blue states and cities, immediately became politicized. After watching video of the encounter, President Donald Trump claimed the woman who was shot “violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer, who seems to have shot her in self defense.” He also said it was “hard to believe” that the ICE agent is alive and added that he is recovering at a hospital.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a Wednesday evening news conference that the woman was \"blocking\" officers who were attempting to dislodge their vehicle from the snow.\n\n \"ICE agents repeatedly ordered her to get out of the car and to stop obstructing law enforcement. But she refused to obey their commands,\" Noem said. \"She then proceeded to weaponize her vehicle and she attempted to run a law enforcement officer over.\"\n\nNoem said the ICE officer, \"fearing for his life and the other officers around him and the safety of the public,\" fired shots defensively.\n\nNoem said the officer had been released from the hospital and was with family. \"Any loss of life is a tragedy…all of us agree in this situation, it was preventable,\" she said.\n\nThe incident, coming on the heels of the Trump administration's expanded immigration operations in blue states and cities, immediately became politicized. \n\nDemocrats, however — including Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, with whom Noem said she spoke — questioned Trump and Noem's accounting of the events. Walz warned in his own press conference that Trump \"would make this about me\" and that the shooting was \"so, so preventable\" and \"so unnecessary.\"\n\nWalz called on Minnesotans to remain calm and said he is prepared to activate the National Guard if needed. Police Chief Brian O’Hara told Minneapolis his officers last month to intervene if they see ICE agents using excessive force against residents or risk losing their jobs.\n\nHomeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said officers were “conducting targeted operations when rioters began blocking ICE officers and one of these violent rioters weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them — an act of domestic terrorism.”\n\nMcLaughlin said the officer feared for his life and “the safety of the public.”\n\n“He used his training and saved his own life and that of his fellow officers,” she said. “The alleged perpetrator was hit and is deceased. Thankfully, the ICE officers who were hurt are expected to make full recoveries.”\n\nAnd Stephen Miller, a senior presidential aide and architect of Trump's mass deportation strategy, called video he posted of the incident \"domestic terrorism.\"\n\nLocal Minneapolis officials, however, feel differently.\n\nAccording to Frey's office, Minneapolis police officers responded to the reports of shots fired \"just after 9:30 a.m., and found a woman with life-threatening gunshot wounds. Minneapolis firefighters removed the woman from the vehicle and immediately began lifesaving measures until paramedics could respond.\" She was transported to a local hospital, where she eventually died.\n\nFrey accused the Trump administration of trying to “spin this as an action of self-defense.”\n\n“Having seen the video … myself, I want to tell everybody directly that is bullshit,” the mayor said. “This was an agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying, getting killed.”\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., was similarly skeptical.\n\n\"There is no evidence that has been presented to justify this killing. [DHS] Secretary Kristi Noem is a stone-cold liar and has zero credibility. The masked ICE agent who pulled the trigger should be criminally investigated to the full extent of the law for acting with depraved indifference to human life,\" Jeffries said.\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris called the incident \"shocking,\" and said the video \"makes it clear that the Trump administration's explanation of this shooting is pure gaslighting.\"\n\nO’Hara said the woman was not the target of the law enforcement investigation, was unarmed and was shot in the head.\n\nBystander video verified by MS NOW clearly contradicts key parts of Trump’s description. It shows the car partially blocking a two-lane street in a snowy residential neighborhood.\n\nThe footage, which begins moments before the shooting, shows a handful of people milling about, filming the agents as they walk around and toward the vehicle. Whistles — a tactic used by “ICE observers” to warn people that agents are in the area — can be heard.\n\nOne of the officers puts his hand on the driver’s door handle and loudly repeats, “Get out of the car!”\n\nThe car briefly moves in reverse, then starts to drive off when three gunshots ring out, and the car crashes into a parked vehicle. The officer who fired his gun was standing in the street in the direction the car was facing.\n\nThe agent holding the door handle stumbles but stays on his feet as the car drives off. None of the other officers comes in contact with the car, and none appears significantly injured, if at all.\n\nSeveral people at the scene are heard yelling expletives right after the shots were fired.\n\nResidents who spoke to MS NOW at the scene said they saw what appeared to be blood on the deployed airbag on the driver’s side.\n\nShortly after the shooting, residents gathered around federal agents in vehicles, shouting at them and calling the location a crime scene.\n\nThe Trump administration launched a massive immigration enforcement operation in the Minneapolis area this week, deploying approximately 2,000 federal agents to the state.\n\nFederal law enforcement officials have been sent to other Democratic-led cities over the past year, sparking fierce criticism from local lawmakers.\n\nIn October, a federal agent shot a woman five times during an immigration crackdown in Chicago in what the administration similarly characterized as a defensive act. Federal prosecutors brought assault charges against her, but moved to dismiss them after the agent’s text messages bragging about the shooting were presented in court.\n\nAt the news conference, Frey addressed the federal immigration enforcement agency directly.\n\n“I have a message for ICE: Get the fuck out of Minneapolis. We do not want you here,” he said. \n\nThis is a developing story.

Tim Walz","text":"MINNEAPOLIS — For a fleeting moment, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz was on top of the political world.\n\nIt was the summer of 2024, and Walz had become the unlikely Democratic vice presidential nominee alongside Kamala Harris after signing a sweeping progressive agenda into law in Minnesota.\n\nThen, his political career unraveled almost as quickly as it took off. Walz suffered a bruising national defeat, lost his close friend and colleague in a political assassination and found himself under white-hot scrutiny for a sprawling fraud crisis in the state’s welfare programs.\n\nOn Monday, almost a year and a half after Harris asked him to be her running mate, Walz stood before a crowd of reporters at the Minnesota Capitol to announce he was dropping his bid for a third term. His wife, First Lady Gwen Walz, looked on as he read brief prepared remarks and then left abruptly without taking questions.\n\n“I’m confident that I’ll find ways to contribute to the state that I love long after next January,” Walz said in his remarks. “I want Minnesotans to know how grateful I am for the opportunity to serve this state, for the privilege that I have been given to serve in this office.”\n\nWalz’s exit from the governor’s race — and possibly from politics entirely — marked a stunning reversal of fortune and came as he faced unrelenting attacks from his greatest political foe, President Donald Trump, on the issue of fraud.\n\nThe governor’s move to end his re-election campaign amid scrutiny will almost certainly leave a mark on his legacy.\n\n“His legacy is something that, perhaps more than some elected officials, may be dependent on sort of doubling down on righting the ship here in the last year,” said former Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor chair Mike Erlandson, who encouraged Walz to take strong action on fraud in his final year.\n\nMinnesota is facing of one of the largest social services fraud scandals in its history. Federal prosecutors have documented hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of fraud in state autism services, housing and meals programs, among others. The total scope of the theft could reach into the billions when all is uncovered, according to federal prosecutors.\n\nCritics of the Walz administration have long said the governor and his cabinet were too slow to act on stopping fraud. Some of Walz’s aides brushed off political concerns about fraud in recent years, saying the issue didn’t come up in polling.\n\n“All along, he should have been holding his commissioners accountable,” said Minnesota House Speaker Lisa Demuth, a Republican who’s running for governor. “There is not a single person that I know that has been fired.”\n\nThe governor’s decision is likely to be seen as a political victory for Trump, who has led a Republican campaign to cast Walz as inept and corrupt.\n\nWalz blasted Trump and his GOP allies on Monday for “seeking to take advantage of a crisis.”\n\nWalz and Trump traded caustic comments during and after the 2024 election. The governor said Trump was a buffoon, a felon, a fascist and an incompetent businessman. He at one point called for Democrats to “be a little meaner” in standing up to Trump, and said Trump was using federal immigration agents as a “modern-day Gestapo.”\n\nTrump has called Walz a loser, “a very stupid, low IQ man,” and reposted lies that Walz was responsible for the assassination of Melissa and Mark Hortman. On Monday, Trump said on social media that Walz was corrupt, dishonest and has “destroyed the State of Minnesota.”\n\nAt times, Republicans as well as some Democrats questioned whether Walz’s focus was drifting too far toward national politics.\n\nBut after the assassination of the Hortmans in June, Walz was knocked off course. He began wavering over whether to seek a third term in the office before ultimately deciding to run for re-election.\n\nPat Garofalo, a former Republican state representative, said it became clear after Walz announced his re-election campaign that Minnesotans weren’t thrilled by the idea of a third-term governor “no matter who they are.” A poll conducted by the Minnesota Star Tribune in June found that about half of Minnesotans said Walz shouldn’t seek a third term.\n\n“His number-one legislative ally was murdered in the summer,” Garofalo said. “And he had to make this aggressive decision, timeline decision, with the State Fair coming up at a time when he was still grieving. And like at a human level, it’s like none of us make our best decisions while we’re grieving.”\n\nWalz forged ahead anyway, despite skepticism within his own party. Nearly a dozen Democrats who spoke to the Minnesota Star Tribune in recent weeks said they thought Walz should not seek re-election, including several who compared his run for a third term to President Joe Biden’s doomed 2024 campaign.\n\nA group of Democratic-Farmer-Labor state senators had been requesting a meeting with Walz in the past couple of weeks to voice their concerns to him directly and start a private discussion about the path forward, according to multiple people familiar with the effort.\n\nJeff Blodgett, who has run DFL campaigns and worked in Minnesota politics for more than 30 years, said he didn’t see parallels with Biden, who he said had betrayed a pledge to be a one-term president. But he did praise Walz for making a comparatively quick decision.\n\nBiden’s extended public clash with his own party in the face of sagging popularity soured the president’s standing with some Democrats. Walz’s decision to drop out was a “selfless act,” Blodgett said.\n\nDemocratic strategist Abou Amara said there was “really no end in sight” to the criticism Walz is facing for fraud. Federal prosecutors will almost certainly charge more fraudsters as more schemes are uncovered, which will keep the topic in the headlines.\n\n“He stepped aside with enough time for the party to resolve what it’s going to do next. I think that’s a learning lesson from the 2024 presidential campaign,” Amara said.\n\nMinnesota House DFL Leader Zack Stephenson said Walz’s decision to drop out of the race is “another proof point of where the governor is putting the well-being of Minnesota ahead of politics.” Stephenson said Walz followed that same principle in the 2023 legislative session, when he signed a parade of progressive policies into law that codified abortion rights and created new programs providing paid family and medical leave and free school meals, among other things.\n\nIt was that progressive blitz — and some well-timed television appearances that included jabbing at Republicans as “weird” — that raised Walz’s national profile.\n\n“He’s got that famous quote about how you don’t accrue political capital just to stock it up. You have it to use it to improve people’s lives,” Stephenson said. “And I think he did that.”","summary":"MINNEAPOLIS — For a fleeting moment, Minnesota Gov.

CBS News leased a private 14-seat jet for the tour, but the plan was delayed once the U.S. military action in Venezuela became a major story early Saturday morning.\n\nInstead, Dokoupil took the chair Saturday night and broadcast live from San Francisco before returning to New York for his official premiere on Monday. The tour is still on and will commence Tuesday from Miami.\n\nDokoupil’s new role will be the first major test for Weiss, who came to the division with no previous experience in television or with running a massive journalism operation. Choosing on-air talent who help drive ratings for the network is considered the most critical task for a TV news executive.\n\nDokoupil, 45, follows the duo of John Dickerson and Maurice DuBois, who co-anchored “CBS Evening News” for a year. The program tried to bring more in-depth pieces to the typically fast-paced network evening news format. But it lost viewers and put CBS further behind “ABC World News Tonight With David Muir” and “NBC Nightly News With Tom Llamas.”\n\nDokoupil’s first official broadcast returned to a style that resembled previous iterations of “CBS Evening News,” with a tight shot of the anchor sitting at a desk in a newsroom.\n\nOver the past year, Dickerson and DuBois were seated at a long desk and often interacted with correspondents shown on a large screen. The program no longer includes an in-studio meteorologist to present national weather.\n\nDokoupil’s arrival marks the fifth anchor change at the “CBS Evening News” since 2017. NBC has made one change since then, while Muir has been in his role at ABC since 2014.\n\nCBS News promoted Dokoupil’s launch with a whimsical social media video that showed the journalist presenting a piece of paper with his name written on it to commuters at Grand Central Terminal in New York. Asked to pronounce “Dokoupil,” few of the commuters came close even though he had been co-host of “CBS Mornings” for several years.\n\nThe promo seemed like an odd choice given how the network evening news anchor has traditionally been a position requiring gravitas and comforting familiarity for its habit-driven audience.\n\nDokoupil also issued a video message last Thursday suggesting organizations such as CBS News are no longer reliable sources of information for much of the public.\n\n“A lot has changed since the first person sat in this chair,” he said. “But for me, the biggest difference is people do not trust us like they used to. And it’s not just us. It’s all of legacy media.”\n\n“The point is, on too many stories the press has missed the story,” he added. “Because we’ve taken into account the perspective of advocates and not the average American. Or we put too much weight in the analysis of academics or elites and not enough on you.”\n\nThe anchor went further on his Instagram account, where he cited Walter Cronkite, who sat at the desk during the division’s glory years of the 1960s and ’70s. “I can promise we’ll be more accountable and more transparent than Cronkite or anyone else of his era,” he said.\n\nDokoupil’s claim prompted a response from Michael Socolow, a journalism professor at the University of Maine and the son of Sandy Socolow, who produced Cronkite’s broadcast.\n\nSocolow noted how Cronkite believed the public should be skeptical of what it saw on TV news and take in other sources and points of view.\n\nIn an interview with The Times, Socolow said Cronkite was never comfortable with his designation as “the most trusted man in America.” CBS News touted that point, which was based on a single public opinion poll.\n\n“Cronkite thought it wouldn’t be in the public interest to be too trustful of any specific media source,” Socolow said. “And he made that clear in public speeches and TV interviews for decades.”\n\nSocolow posted a clip of a 1972 interview with Cronkite as an example.\n\n“I don’t think they ought to believe me, or they ought to believe Brinkley, or they ought to believe anybody who’s on the air, or they ought to get all their news from one television station,” Cronkite said.\n\nThe latest change at “CBS Evening News” also follows one of the most tumultuous periods in the long history of CBS News. The organization was shaken by the Dec. 20 decision by Weiss to pull a “60 Minutes” piece on the harsh El Salvador mega-prison the U.S. government is using to hold undocumented migrants.\n\nWeiss believed the story needed more reporting, including an on-camera response from Trump White House officials. The White House, Department of Homeland Security and the State Department had all declined comment to “60 Minutes.”\n\nBut the decision to yank the announced segment the day before it was scheduled to air led “60 Minutes” correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi to claim in an email to colleagues that the decision was political. Alfonsi had worked on the story for months and had it vetted by the division’s standards and practices department.\n\n“Government silence is a statement, not a VETO,” Alfonsi wrote in the email. “If the administration’s refusal to participate becomes a valid reason to spike a story, we have effectively handed them a ‘kill switch’’ for any reporting they find inconvenient.”\n\nAlfonsi’s reporting did show up on Canada’s Global TV service, which had been given a feed of the program before the change was made, an embarrassing operational error by CBS News. The segment was shared widely on social media.\n\nEvery move by Weiss has received heightened scrutiny since she was given editorial control over CBS News in October. She joined the network after parent company Paramount acquired the Free Press, a digital news and opinion platform she co-founded. The site made its name by calling out perceived liberal bias by legacy media organizations and so-called woke policies.\n\nMedia industry critics have used the “60 Minutes” controversy to suggest Weiss was installed to placate President Donald Trump as Paramount pursues the acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery, which would require government regulatory approval. A person close to Weiss who was not authorized to comment publicly said Paramount had no say on the Alfonsi piece.\n\nParamount already paid $16 million to Trump to settle a defamation suit against “60 Minutes.” Trump claimed the program deceptively edited an interview with Kamala Harris, calling it election interference. CBS News did not admit any wrongdoing in the settlement.","summary":"Tony Dokoupil took his place at the anchor desk of the \"CBS Evening News\" on Monday as the troubled news division undergoes reinvention under its new editor in chief, Bari Weiss.

Jacob began the year with a visit to Stephen Colbert and insisted that a toughened border policy does not stem immigration; yet, as he said that deterrence at the border does not work, the number of illegals had already begun crashing, leading to negative net migration. When the California wildfires erupted, Jacob was on the scene, giving Gov. Gavin Newsom the chance to spin better PR for himself. NBC News had to settle a major defamation suit based on Soboroff’s errant reporting of a doctor alleged to have performed unneeded hysterectomies on immigrants. It was entirely based on a sole witness later proven to be unreliable, so the network paid out the penalty. Soboroff was a regular sympathizer of illegals and a critic of ICE in a string of slanted reports.\n\nHe shamed himself with an excitable interview at a No Kings rally – by shoving his microphone into the snout of an inflatable pink unicorn protester.\n\n“We’re here peacefully protesting, looking as ridiculous as we can, just so maybe we appeal to the president because he’s a ridiculous leader that is normalizing abuse of power.

Jeffrey Goldberg – The Atlantic: The Editor in Chief for the outlet splashed the biggest controversy this year with his report about being inadvertently added to a Defense Department messaging discussion on airstrikes on the Houthis. While certainly a major foul-up by the officials (leading to the dismissal of Mike Waltz as National Security Advisor), the supposed downfall of Secretary Pete Hegseth did not occur. This is because, despite Goldberg’s claims of being privy to sensitive intel, he never delivered on the promise to reveal such. Jeff had the first reveal of the Kamala Harris election book, which was not a significant scoop, largely due to his publisher being tight friends with the former VP. He told Jake Tapper the press could not report on Joe Biden’s mental slide without firm sourcing, although Alex Thompson wrote about how White House officials confirmed they had lied about his condition, and the press played along.\n\n8. Rachel Maddow – MS NOW: The highly paid queen at this outlet stepped back from her nightly news show at Trump’s 100-day mark in order to only work Monday nights. She had a dramatic meltdown over birthright citizenship. In her trademarked fact-free style, she complained that Trump ordered a fleet of Teslas and accused him of corruption with Elon Musk, despite the reality that the order had been placed under Biden’s term. Rachel actually complained that the president was highlighting a pediatric cancer patient during his State of the Union address. \n\nMaddow roundly mocked a Florida sheriff for his allegedly militant crackdown on No Kings protesters when he promised to arrest those blocking roadways, and she then showed the protests were properly controlled. She concocted a fever-dream conspiracy that Trump targeted drug boats so he could freely deport all Venezuelans. The openly gay hostess allowed Kamala Harris to explain that she did not choose Pete Buttigieg as her running mate because, “as a black candidate with a gay running mate, it would be a real risk.”\n\nAfter President Trump featured the young cancer patient D.J. Daniel during the State of the Union, Rachel was raging about the touching moment and had to turn it bitterly political.\n\nWhen will Democrats be brave enough to point out @MSNBC is actually hurting them? Trump celebrates DJ Daniel, a 13yo who beat brain cancer, and not only do Democrats not cheer, but Rachael Maddow rages. These people are out of touch and in a bubble. pic.twitter.com/byLRsOHa4X— Erick Erickson (@EWErickson) March 5, 2025\n\n7. Scott McFarlane – CBS News: The network’s stentorian correspondent was largely despondent much of the year. The January 6 obsessive was upset that the DOJ took down its Jan. 6 web page. Scott was perturbed by GOP behavior during the SOTU, but had zero comment on the crude shouting from Democrats. In a report, he was critical of calling drug cartels terrorist groups, after showing a memorial to the 100,000 fentanyl victims. Expectantly, he slams having troops in D.C. but admits they are not actually conducting arrests, and then ignores the arrests of murderers of a congressional intern. Scott seemed bothered by the dire move of a Florida radio station promoting “Trump Country.” Claimed no evidence that Charlie Kirk’s shooter was investigated as a trans individual, based on the opinion of a mayor, when no quote saying that came from the Bureau and the FBI was actually looking into transgenderism as an issue. \n\nIn an amazing example of “Main Character Syndrome,” MacFarlane claimed he had PTSD and nearly died when Trump was almost assassinated. He explains that the crowd, for whatever reason, was allegedly about to turn on reporters on the scene, but when the president raised his fist, that quelled the threat, and his life was spared. All of this was supposed to have played out in a matter of seconds.\n\nCBS's Scott MacFarlane claims that after Trump was shot \"I got diagnosed with PTSD within 48 hours. I got put on trauma leave, not because, I think, of the shooting, but because, you could, you saw it in the eyes, the reaction of the people. They were coming for us. If he didn't… pic.twitter.com/MfrQxN9mvh— Alex Christy (@alexchristy17) July 17, 2025\n\n6. Nicolle Wallace – MS NOW: The precious pundit with a vocal fry and an afternoon show was in all of her anti-Trump glory this past year. Her derangement was at high levels, as seen with her coverage of the State of the Union Address when she referenced the president highlighting the young cancer patient who wants to be a cop, and somehow she turned that into a rant about January 6. After a laundry list of leftist violence, she insisted that only conservatives commit political violence. Nicky blamed Trump supporters for the house fire of a district judge, well after authorities determined there was no foul play. The woman who called the hard videos of Joe Biden’s decline “fake” now says she can “see” that President Trump has mental issues. She admitted to being “gutted” at seeing Venezuelan gang members being deported.\n\nIn a desperate attempt at gaslighting, Nicky actually denied that any Democrats have ever called Trump Hitler. Seriously, she said that. Okay then, roll the tape!\n\nNicolle Wallace: No one calls Trump Hitler*.....*Except every day on my show pic.twitter.com/QjI6KklYsU— Tom Elliott (@tomselliott) October 27, 2025\n\n5. Kaitlan Collins – CNN: Can you say she was promoted when she returned to her previous post? The primetime hostess, whose ratings have been uniformly dismal, was also reinstated as the network’s White House correspondent and was routinely shown to be out of her depth. Says that Trump ignoring rogue judges is a constitutional crisis, not the lone judges who overstep their authority to override the White House policies. Kaitlan was called out and belittled at the Tulsi Gabbard WH presser. During a visit with Seth Meyers, she complained that Trump makes her work so much. In a comically inept segment, Collins claimed Trump was ducking the media due to the economy, when he had not only been fully available all week but then, just moments after her claim, Trump gave a 90-minute press conference.\n\nKaitlan fumbled trying to corner Doug Collins on the Signal scandal when he was not involved, she also tried and failed to trap JD Vance with a question on January 6, and disputed claims by the White House that there was a ceasefire when she was next interrupted to be corrected that it was actually in place. Lamely, she told Sen. Ted Cruz that we do not know the motive of Charlie Kirk’s shooter. Kaitlan was defied by her own network as she tried to sell the canard that illegals cannot get healthcare, but Jake Tapper had previously shown that was the case. She actually expressed dismay that Trump did not care about being called “racist.”\n\nShamefully, Kaitlan had to delete a post when she was caught promoting a website for Luigi Mangione with fundraising options made available for the admitted murderer.\n\n1: She deleted the post. (If there was nothing wrong then why did she delete it?)2: Here is a screenshot. I have marked out the website that she shared... the fundraising link that she is now claiming she did not share.3: The cover-up is always worse than the crime pic.twitter.com/xjE7TSn50R— L A R R Y (@LarryOConnor) February 16, 2025\n\n4. Lawrence O’Donnell – MS NOW: While rarely moving the political needle, Larry is a primetime fixture, and his frequently imbalanced lectures and rants are often so perplexing that you have to wonder if any of the network brass even pays attention to him.\n\nHe was critical of the White House press corps when, after the first press briefing with Karoline Leavitt, he saw them acting polite and professional. Not long after Trump took office, Larry needed to take a week off because the president delivered too much news for him to cover. As the network was constricting and struggling for viewers, he actually held out for a better contract.\n\nEver the conspiracist, O’Donnell suggested JD Vance released the Trump birthday letter to Jeffrey Epstein so he could bring down Trump and become president. After a SCOTUS ruling, it was sanely stated that now President Trump could deport “any person…any time…anywhere….” In a sign of seeing his distant second place in the ratings threatened, O’Donnell had a meltdown on air over Scott Jennings appearing on CNN during the same hour.\n\nIn an absolute gem of journalism excellence, Lawrence “proved” there was no need at all for troops to be sent into Washington, D.C., based on a fictional scene from an 80-year-old black-and-white movie.\n\nBehold, as @Lawrence O’Donnell proves there is no crime in D.C. as he offers up for evidence…how no National Guard troops appear in the scene at Union Station in a Jimmy Stewart movie from 1939.And with that, Donald Trump is therefore DEBUNKED, we assume… pic.twitter.com/ntDUbvudak— Brad Slager: CNN+ Lifetime Subscriber (@MartiniShark) August 22, 2025\n\n3. Jen Psaki – MS NOW: Where to begin with the hyper-partisan former press secretary hack? How about her take on the Signal scandal? Or the time she accidentally admitted on a podcast how MSNBC only reports negatively about Trump?\n\nSomehow, Psaki never saw the side of Biden’s decline when working in the White House. She says Trump made no international deals, despite numerous deals having been brokered, and an hour later, Trump announced a new deal with Britain. Jennifer complained that Trump was off for Memorial Day, when she previously defended Joe Biden for taking off for the very same holiday. Psaki was tabbed to fill the Tuesday-Friday schedule vacated by Rachel Maddow, and she promptly lost half of Maddow’s audience after taking over the time slot.\n\nIn a condescending and anti-feminist discussion on Jennifer Welch’s podcast, Jennifer implied that Usha Vance is a hostage in her marriage in need of being rescued.\n\nJen Psaki Says JD Vance is ‘Scarier’ Than Trump“He's smarter in some ways, and he's young and ambitious.” 😱 pic.twitter.com/WHsfJlCr3U— Chief Nerd (@TheChiefNerd) October 21, 2025\n\n2. Margaret Brennan – CBS News: The Sunday hostess of Face the Nation was so routinely schooled by her Republican guests that she has earned her Master's Degree in Narrative Rendering. Margaret seems to prepare for each episode with arranged talking points lined up, and has no need to do more, which leads her to being consistently unraveled by the presentation of basic facts.\n\nShe suggests poorer states cannot take care of themselves in a disaster, and also claimed no DEI spending took place at USAID, then, when shown proof, said the amount was negligible. She opposed deportations because they could rob us of the next Einstein. Margaret denied that Mahmoud Kahlil was a Hamas sympathizer.\n\nBrennan was completely flummoxed by the reasoning behind “penguin tariffs” and argued with Sen. Rand Paul on defunding \"Sesame Street,\" though it is no longer owned by PBS. Maggie was shamed by Sen. Tom Cotton over the riots and his New York Times column, and lost to Secretary Marco Rubio on Iranian enrichment, and then Rubio, on another visit, again had to enlighten her, this time about why European leaders came to the White House over peace talks.\n\nIn yet another talk with Marco Rubio, Ms. Brennan actually said free speech was weaponized by the Nazis.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio defends @JDVance's \"historic\" speech last week in Munich, leaves ABC's Margaret Brennan speechless after she tries to claim that free speech was \"weaponized\" by the Nazis. Incredible exchange: 👇 pic.twitter.com/GYLZfopVwP— Scott Morefield (@SKMorefield) February 16, 2025\n\n1. Jake Tapper – CNN: The once respected journalist at the network has devolved into a meandering mess of a media figure. \n\nThe biggest factor was the release of the book “Original Sin,” where he and co-author Alex Thompson revealed all of the media cover-ups involving the condition of former President Joe Biden. The main issue, obviously, was Tapper’s participation in that gambit.\n\nFor the book tour, Tapper hired a crisis communications firm to run his PR campaign. This is for good reason, as he has a conflict with his own past coverage. In his book, Jake praised two Wall Street Journal reporters – Annie Linskey and Siobhan Hughes – for their report about Biden’s flagging condition, and he even cast scorn on the journalists who had criticized them at the time their coverage was published. Only issue – he was among those criticizing them at the time. Here is his segment, not with the reporters but with Democratic Sen. Chris Coons, as both men questioned the veracity of their reporting.\n\nHere was @JakeTapper making snide commentary that the initial @WSJ report on Joe Biden's Condition was from a Murdoch-owned outlet, they only quoted Republicans, and then he did not speak to the reporters, but had Chris Coons spinning for the party.1/2https://t.co/zLC6G7sGIv— Brad Slager: CNN+ Lifetime Subscriber (@MartiniShark) May 15, 2025\n\nThen, to conclude his book run, Jake sat for an interview with George Clooney, the actor who helped provoke Biden’s removal from the party ticket.\n\nLook at the adverse effects of the election on stardom.The George Clooney @CNN shows in their promo versus the Clooney who appeared with Tapper. pic.twitter.com/2SYm8FObhJ— Brad Slager: CNN+ Lifetime Subscriber (@MartiniShark) April 17, 2025\n\nApart from book-related issues, it was still a tough 2025 for Tapper. When he appeared in the CNN defamation lawsuit, he testified that he did not know about his ratings, when there are examples of him crowing about his show’s numbers. He next went on to say we are entering an era of misinformation, days after the defamation trial. Then, regarding the CBS/60Minutes defamation suit, he “proved” there was no wrongdoing by asking them if they had done anything wrong.\n\nHe could not help but dredge up January 6 on Biden’s final day in office. Jake slammed Trump for his rude State of the Union address, well after Democrats had been raging during his speech. He had to be taught about the details of immigrants being eligible to be deported for supporting terrorists.\n\nDuring the redistricting news cycle, Tapper excused Illinois' gerrymandering and then said GOP states are the worst offenders. In a visit with Seth Meyers, he says he never saw a government silence people like they are now, just as Google publicly admitted its censoring efforts on YouTube. Similarly, he showed he was ignorant when a grand jury indicted former FBI Director James Comey when blaming Trump. Obliviously, the man who once platformed white supremacist Richard Spencer on his program was critical of Trump for not properly condemning Tucker Carlson over his Nick Fuentes interview.\n\nJake clearly lied about Trump wanting to kill Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly, then later bizarrely announced the recently arrested J6 bomber was a “white man.” As the Minnesota fraud story swelled, Jake allowed Rep. Ilhan Omar to spin about the scandal.\n\nPerhaps the most emblematic evidence of the tough year for the CNN veteran was shown in stark fashion, in a matter of weeks. There was a rapid evolution in how his book went from being a celebrated piece of journalism to an indictment of the news industry, then ultimately a hit on his very own credibility. With “Original Sin” out for about one month, Jake saw his ratings plunge by 25 percent, hitting a decade low. To pardon the metaphor, that is a sign of the people deciding to turn the page.\n\nJake Tapper's CNN show lost 25% of their audience since releasing his book.The Lead with Jake Tapper hit a nearly decade-low in ratings in May, averaging 525,000 viewers from April 28 to May 25. pic.twitter.com/G5nnxGRM1A— Breanna Morello (@BreannaMorello) May 29, 2025\n\nEditor's Note: Get access to Brad Slager's \"Riffed From the Headlines,\" a daily VIP feature where he looks to bring accountability to the mainstream media.

Like, I would never run and I don't want anything to do with politics. \n\n'I feel like politics is such a dangerous thing and I think if both sides met in the middle everyone would be so much more happier and I think there's radical left, there's radical right and there's a lot of people who get too extreme.\n\nKai Trump explains why she has no interest in politics\n\nProgress: 0%\n\nCurrent Time 0:00\n\nDuration Time 1:00\n\nVideo Quality\n\n---WhiteBlackRedGreenBlueYellowMagentaCyan---OpaqueSemi-Opaque\n\n---WhiteBlackRedGreenBlueYellowMagentaCyan---OpaqueSemi-TransparentTransparent\n\n---WhiteBlackRedGreenBlueYellowMagentaCyan---OpaqueSemi-TransparentTransparent\n\n50%75%100%125%150%175%200%300%400%\n\nNoneRaisedDepressedUniformDropshadow\n\nDefaultMonospace SerifProportional SerifMonospace Sans-SerifProportional Sans-SerifCasualScriptSmall Caps\n\nKai Trump made her first podcast appearance when she was interviewed on Impaulsive\n\nThe teenager risked the wrath of her grandfather, Donald Trump, with her comment on politics\n\n'And that's where social media really ties into it because social media kind of makes your Instagram or your feed be one way or the other and there's not a lot of things on social media if you're very much in the middle. \n\n'I think that kind of makes some people crazy and some people buy into it too much. I think that's like the best way to say it. There's no bad blood. I'm very much in the middle. It is what it is, they ran against each other.'\n\nFinally, the budding golfer ended by offering an insight into Trump's presidential future, as podcast host Paul pressed her on the possibility of her grandfather standing for a third term. \n\nThe teenager admitted that he has no plans to run again but left the door open by admitting 'a lot could happen until 2028'. \n\nThe president has made a splash in the political sphere over the US's military action in Venezuela and the removal of the country’s president, Nicolas Maduro.\n\nTrump announced early Saturday morning that the US had taken Maduro and his wife Cilia on drug and weapon charges after 'successfully' carrying out a military strike in the capital of Caracas. \n\nMaduro landed late Saturday afternoon at a small airport in New York City's northern suburbs following the middle-of-the-night operation that extracted him and his wife, Cilia Flores, from their home in a military base in the capital, Caracas - an act that Maduro's government called 'imperialist.' \n\nMaduro pleaded not guilty to drug trafficking and other charges at his defiant appearance in a New York court Monday, two days after being snatched by US forces in the stunning operation on his home in Caracas.\n\nMaduro and his wife are pictured in handcuffs as they landed at a Manhattan helipad and then transported in an armored car for Monday's arraignment in federal court\n\nThe 18-year-old insisted that she had no 'bad blood' with Trump's former rival Kamala Harris\n\nMaduro, 63, told a federal judge in Manhattan: 'I'm innocent. I'm not guilty.'\n\nHis wife, who appeared at her arraignment with two bandages on her face, also pleaded not guilty to conspiring to send cocaine into the US and other gun and drug-related charges.\n\nThe couple face up to life in prison - and potentially the death sentence - if they are convicted of the several charges that US authorities have cited as justification for their lightning raid on Saturday. \n\nWhile Kai isn't eyeing a career in the Oval Office, she is zeroing in her sights on the fairways. \n\nShe may not have inherited her grandfather's penchant for 'dangerous' politics but she has developed his talent for golf. \n\nLater this year, she will be joining the University of Miami as a part of the 2026 signing class to play collegiate golf. She committed to the school back in August. \n\nIn November, she made her debut on the LPGA Tour - the world's top women's golf tour - alongside the likes of World No 2 Nelly Korda at The ANNIKA in Belleair, Florida. \n\nTrump is pictured on stage after speaking to House Republican lawmakers on Tuesday \n\nThe aspiring golfer is pictured with the president at the Ryder Cup in September 2025\n\nKai Trump shares sweet golf outing with her grandpa, Donald Trump\n\nProgress: 0%\n\nCurrent Time 0:00\n\nDuration Time 0:44\n\nVideo Quality\n\n---WhiteBlackRedGreenBlueYellowMagentaCyan---OpaqueSemi-Opaque\n\n---WhiteBlackRedGreenBlueYellowMagentaCyan---OpaqueSemi-TransparentTransparent\n\n---WhiteBlackRedGreenBlueYellowMagentaCyan---OpaqueSemi-TransparentTransparent\n\n50%75%100%125%150%175%200%300%400%\n\nNoneRaisedDepressedUniformDropshadow\n\nDefaultMonospace SerifProportional SerifMonospace Sans-SerifProportional Sans-SerifCasualScriptSmall Caps\n\nAnd Kai, who has also made her mark as an influencer and social media star, has a well of expertise to tap into.

I try my best not to let it bother me. Especially the past year, since he's become President, I've had to learn that, yes, they're following me, but also to focus in pretending that they're not there. \n\n'Obviously, they are there. But if you can try to not really focus on that and enjoy your time with your friends, your family or whatever it is - it makes it easier. \n\n'Because for the first few months, it was tough. It was not easy having someone following you all the time. But once I was like: \"Their only job is to protect me. I'm going to focus on my stuff and have them do their job\". It made it so much easier.'\n\nElsewhere on the podcast, the 18-year-old seemingly extended an olive branch to Trump's former rival Kamala Harris and said there is no 'bad blood' between them.\n\nWhen asked by WWE star Paul about her opinions on Harris, she said: 'To be honest with you, I stay out of politics completely.

'And she had just laughed about it.' \n\nSwisher further detailed how Harris then proceeded to 'yell' at her in front of an audience. \n\n'And then she went into this sort of high-handed kind of thing where she was like yelling at me for even asking the question. I was just like I'm gonna kill you, I literally can't believe you just did that, which was interesting,' she said, adding that the interaction 'was a real insight.' \n\nAfter Swisher mentioned what RFK Jr. had said, Harris, who sat across from the journalist on stage, in front of multiple copies of her book 107 Days, looked right at her and said: 'People will die for what they're doing, I can't laugh about that, I'm sorry.' \n\nHarris then told Swisher: 'Kara, it's personal for me, it's personal for me. \n\n'And I can't laugh at it because like so many of you who have known people who suffer because of unknown diseases, or cancers, for which there are no cures, or there is the beginning of, but more work that needs to be done for the cure - what they are doing to push misinformation and lies at the highest level of government, it's criminal!' \n\nSwisher sat there silently, allowing Harris to have her moment, as she added: 'And people will die because of what they're doing, and I can't laugh about that, I'm sorry.

People live in homes, not corporations,” Trump added. \n\nTrump said he would discuss the subject and other proposals related to affordability in a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos in two weeks. \n\nLarge institutional investors, such as Blackstone, have bought up thousands of family homes since the financial crisis of 2008 led to increased foreclosures. These investors often buy and rent out homes, which critics say has reduced housing supply and dramatically inflated rent across the country. \n\nFollowing the president’s social media post, shares of Blackstone fell by as much as 9 percent, CNN report\n\nThe asset management giant has built one of the largest rental housing portfolios in the country in recent years, according to CNBC. \n\nHowever, the firm has rejected the notion that its investments have stoked inflation and diminished the housing supply. Blackstone told CNBC in July that it owns less than one percent of the 46 million rental homes in the country. \n\nWhile it was unclear how Trump could limit institutional investors’ purchases of single-family homes through executive action, several states, including New York, have taken legal steps to slow investors from scooping up homes. \n\nNews of Trump’s plans to stop large institutional investors from buying up homes comes as he faces mounting pressure to deliver on his campaign promise to lower the high cost of living, particularly ahead of the November midterm elections. \n\nLast month, Trump said the 2026 midterms would revolve around “pricing,” despite repeatedly describing affordability as a “hoax” spread by the Democratic party. \n\nBetween 2020 and the end of 2025, house prices climbed nearly 55 percent nationwide, CNN reports.\n\nIn November, inflation fell to 2.7 percent year-over-year, the smallest increase recorded since July, according to a December consumer price index report from the Labor Department. Meanwhile, data published by the government last month showed that the economy grew at an annual rate of 4.3 percent, the fastest it has in two years. \n\nDespite positive hints, recent polls show that Americans – including many of Trump’s own MAGA base – are feeling pinched by the current economic climate. \n\nA Politico survey from November found that 46 percent of respondents believe the current cost of living is the worst they can remember. That number includes 37 percent of Trump 2024 voters and 53 percent of voters who cast their ballots for former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nNearly half of respondents also reported struggling to afford essentials, including groceries, healthcare and housing.","summary":"Shares of Blackstone fell as much as 9 percent after Trump’s post","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-ban-investors-family-homes-b2896408.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2026/01/07/8/53/US-POLITICS-TRUMP-GOP-cicv9y12.jpeg?crop=4096.3,2730.9,x379.7,y38&trim=37,4,216,379&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-07 21:09:18","author":"Isabel Keane","authors":["Isabel Keane"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.251},{"id":391719538,"title":"DHS' Attempt to Justify ICE Shooting in Minnesota Quickly Shot Down: 'Demonstrably False'","text":"After an incident that was captured on video in Minneapolis, MN, where an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer shot a woman dead, outraged citizens and politicians are calling the Department of Homeland Security's statement on the shooting \"demonstrably false\" and \"propaganda.\"The video circulating on social media shows a woman in a dark red Honda SUV being approached by ICE officers as she is told to get out of her vehicle.

Henry Cuellar of Texas, whom Trump pardoned just last month.\n\nThe endorsement, which Trump announced in a Truth Social post Tuesday, went to Webb County Judge Tano Tijerina. Trump also used the post to lash out at Cuellar for what he described as “disloyalty” for seeking reelection as a Democrat.\n\n“I don’t know why, but the fact that Henry Cuellar would be running against Donald J. Trump, and the Republican Party, seems to be a great act of disloyalty and, perhaps more importantly, the act of a fool who would immediately go back to a Political Party, the Radical Left Democrats, whose views are different from his, but not nearly good or strong enough to be a true Republican,” Trump wrote in one of two lengthy posts.\n\nTrump appeared most irate at Cuellar’s decision to return immediately to electoral politics, suggesting that he never expected Cuellar to run for office again. \n\nCuellar was indicted in 2024 and charged with bribery, unlawful foreign influence, and money laundering, but he has denied making any deal with Trump in exchange for the pardon. He filed to run for reelection the week after Trump issued it, a move that reportedly angered the president at the time.\n\nTrump’s endorsement of Tijerina notably came hours after he publicly predicted that he would face impeachment if Republicans lose their House majority in November. The nonpartisan Cook Political Report currently rates Cuellar’s district as “lean Democratic.”\n\nOn Tuesday, Cuellar again thanked Trump for the pardon but declined to engage with his accusations of disloyalty.\n\n“As mentioned previously, my family and I thank President Trump for his pardon,” Cuellar said in a statement to NBC News. “I look forward to a resounding victory in November.”\n\nCuellar, who was first elected to Congress in 2004, has long proven difficult to unseat. Even as Republicans gained ground in the region in 2024, his district was one of just 13 House seats nationwide that elected a Democrat while also backing Trump for president. Cuellar won his race with 53% of the vote, outperforming Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris.\n\nBut within his own party, Cuellar remains an ideological outlier. He is the only anti-abortion Democrat in Congress and frequently sides with Republicans on issues ranging from reproductive rights to border security.\n\nStill, Republicans see an opening. The National Republican Congressional Committee has targeted Cuellar’s seat as a top pickup opportunity following a redistricting overhaul approved last summer. \n\nAccording to The Texas Tribune, the new map removes roughly half of Cuellar’s current constituents and gives Trump a 10-point advantage—significantly complicating Cuellar’s path to reelection.\n\nRelated | What Trump’s pardons expose about his politics\n\nTijerina welcomed Trump’s backing on X, calling it an honor.\n\n“Together, we are going to take South Texas back and put America First,” he wrote.\n\nA former minor league baseball player, Tijerina was once a Democrat who switched parties on Fox News in 2024.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, made clear that his support for Tijerina is as much about retribution as ideology. While reiterating that he would still pardon Cuellar if given the chance, Trump said the congressman “deserves to be beaten badly in the upcoming election.”\n\n“Henry should not be allowed to serve in Congress again,” Trump wrote. “Tano’s views are stronger, better, and far less tainted than Henry’s, and he has my Complete and Total Endorsement to be the next Representative from Texas’ 28th Congressional District.”\n\nIn a follow-up post, Trump shared photos of letters from Cuellar’s daughters, urging him to pardon their parents. Trump also pardoned Cuellar’s wife, Imelda, who had faced related charges.\n\n“I never assumed he would be running for Office again, and certainly not as a Democrat, who essentially destroyed his life even with the Pardon given,” Trump wrote, adding that, “despite doing him by far the greatest favor of his life,” he now felt compelled to back a challenger. \n\n“Nobody knows Henry Cuellar better than Donald J. Trump,” he said, calling Cuellar “a weak and incompetent version of me.”\n\nCuellar, for his part, argued last month that the case against him was “absolutely” tied to his criticism of the Biden administration’s border policies. Prosecutors alleged in 2024 that Cuellar and his wife accepted nearly $600,000 in bribes from an Azerbaijani oil and gas company and a Mexican bank. Both pleaded not guilty.\n\nTexas’ primaries are scheduled for early March, but several other candidates are running in Cuellar’s 28th Congressional District, including Republican Eileen Day and Democrats Andrew Vantine and Ricardo Villarreal.\n\nTrump also issued several other House endorsements on Tuesday, backing Amanda McKinney in Washington’s 4th District and issuing a rare dual endorsement for Gina Swoboda and Jay Feely in Arizona’s 1st District.\n\nTaken together, the episode underscores a familiar Trump pattern: loyalty demanded, favors weaponized, and punishment reserved for those who fail to show sufficient deference.","summary":"In one of his latest displays of political score-settling, President Donald Trump endorsed a Republican challenger running against Democratic Rep.

Fake news is not only a collective betrayal of the public trust, it is also damned expensive as taxpayers are learning.\n\nSo it fell to a lone independent journalist to post a video that ended the political career of Kamala Harris’s 2024 running mate by exposing a massive Somali-led fraud scandal and violation of public funds that continues to mushroom.\n\nThe New York Times dedicated more than 1,500 words to President Donald Trump’s “Anti-Somali attacks” while at the same time failing to mention the staggering fraud operation with clear evidence the operation was overwhelmingly perpetrated by Somali immigrants. (The Justice Department has charged 98 individuals in connection with various Minnesota fraud schemes, including 85 individuals of Somali descent and it is just getting started.)\n\nNick Shirley, the viral YouTuber who exposed the fraud at Somali-run daycare centers in Minnesota, is largely credited with Walz’s resignation from the 2026 gubernatorial race.\n\nRelated: Independent journalist exposes massive fraud at childcare centers; Not news for Star Tribune, networks, December 29, 2025\n\nShirley posted a 42-minute documentary on Dec. 26 which found that nearly a dozen Somali daycare centers funded by taxpayer dollars were not actually providing services.\n\nIn response to the governor accusing Shirley of being a “conspiracy theorist” who broke into daycare centers, Shirley posted on X that he “ended” Walz’s career.\n\nWalz was furious that Shirley’s reporting had exposed daycare centers, complaining that Republicans are now somehow “demonizing” Somalis.\n\n“But the political gamesmanship we’re seeing from Republicans is only making that fight harder to win. We’ve got Republicans here in the legislature playing hide-and-seek with whistleblowers,” Walz said. “We’ve got conspiracy theorist right-wing YouTubers breaking into daycare centers and demanding access to our children. We’ve got the President of the United States demonizing our Somali neighbors and wrongly confiscating childcare funding that Minnesotans rely on. It’s disgusting. And it is dangerous.”\n\nShirley responded on X:\n\n“You should’ve put Minnesota first when you had the chance, instead you let billions of dollars of fraud happen across your state… anywayssss … I hear Quality LEARING Center is hiring.”\n\nThe infamous Quality “Learning” Center received $1.9 million in taxpayer funds in 2025 and $4 million in total funding from Minnesota’s Child Care Assistance Program (CCAP), Shirley reported in the documentary.\n\nState employees in Minnesota stated in November that Walz bore full responsibility for the fraud by working to “discredit fraud reports” and ignore whistleblowers.\n\nThe Daily Caller’s Nicole Silverio noted: “Democrats and state leaders defended Somalis while the fraud was uncovered, including Democratic Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, who said that Somalis were part of the community’s family. Minnesota Democratic Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan appeared on a Somali TV station wearing a hijab.”\n\nThe Department of Justice has launched a criminal investigation into whether Walz was complicit in or criminally liable for the ongoing $9 billion fraud scandal.\n\n“It’s a top priority for President Trump, and he believes that Governor Walz is criminally liable, and I think that the Department of Justice is going to find out,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said.\n\nI ENDED TIM WALZ\n— Nick shirley (@nickshirleyy) January 5, 2026\n\n2026 Contract With Our Readers \n\n Media ethics update: Lone independent journalist toppled governor propped up by corporate media, WorldTribune.com","summary":"by WorldTribune Staff, January 7, 2026 Real World News Were legacy media outlets lazy, incompetent or blatantly the PR division for Minnesota Democrat Gov.

Late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel also took the same cognitive test as Trump at Walter Reed Medical Center. “In the interest of fairness, and also to get a sense of what he keeps babbling about, we got in touch with a doctor who gives this test regularly, these cognitive exams. And I asked her to administer one to me,” Jimmy Kimmel said post taking the test.\n\nHe added, “This is the official exam administered by a medical professional. I did not see the questions ahead of time. And I’m willing to release the full unedited version if necessary. With that said, let’s find out just how difficult this big, beautiful test is. And how my brain stacks up against our stable genius President’s.”\n\nTurns out, Jimmy Kimmel also received a perfect score. Jimmy Kimmel also dedicated his Best Host win at the Critics Choice Awards to Trump with a dash of sarcasm, of course.\n\nTrump, keeping up with his series of many posts, bragging about his perfect health, both cognitive and physical, on January 2 this year, shared a Truth Social post, in which he wrote, “The White House Doctors have just reported that I am in “PERFECT HEALTH,” and that I “ACED” for the third straight time, my cognitive examination, something which no other President, or previous Vice President, was willing to take.”\n\nA mention of Donald Trump’s health would be incomplete without the many swipes Gavin Newsom has taken on the same of late. He once said that Trump needs to be “stabilized.” In a rather strongly worded X post, Gavin Newsom said this about Trump’s health: “He seems, dare I say, in decline cognitively. And dare I say, forgive me, perhaps unfair, physically, and these are just rantings of someone that needs an intervention, needs some help, needs to be stabilized, dare I say.”","summary":"Gavin Newsom accepted Trump’s challenge on national TV right away","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/challenge-accepted-gavin-newsom-ready-for-trumps-cognitive-test-name-your-time-and-place","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Newsom_Trump_Cognitive_Test_Faceoff_1200.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-07 19:29:53","author":"Pranita Chaubey","authors":["Pranita Chaubey"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.051},{"id":391705038,"title":"The most hypocritical reactions to Trump’s masterstroke Maduro ouster","text":"In this case, former Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro, an alleged narco-terrorist and illegitimate president with an outstanding criminal grand jury indictment coming up on six years old, was rightly snatched by U.S. Delta Force commandos out of his high-security compound in Caracas. Two days later, he was being arraigned in a New York district court for alleged crimes, including narco-terrorism and cocaine importation conspiracy.\n\nEstimates may vary, but as many as 100,000 Americans are killed each year from illegal drugs, including fentanyl and cocaine, entering the country from countries such as Venezuela. Context: If multiplying that number from the past 10 years alone, we’re talking more American deaths than those lost in World War I, World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, 9/11, and the Iraq and Afghanistan wars combined.\n\nBut the Left is not happy with Trump’s masterstroke here and has been patently hypocritical in the process. Here’s Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) leading the charge on the hypocrisy front.\n\nMurphy, 2019: “If Trump cared about consistency, he would make the realist case for intervention in Venezuela (getting rid of Maduro is good for the United States) rather than trying to pretend his Administration all of the sudden cares about toppling anti-democratic regimes.”\n\nMurphy, 2026, post-Maduro arrest: “The invasion of Venezuela has nothing to do with American security. Venezuela is not a security threat to the U.S.”\n\nMurphy made the latter completely contradictory comment to CNN’s Dana Bash on Sunday. And for whatever reason, Bash declined to bring up Murphy’s 2019 comments to ask him a simple question: “What changed between then and now?”\n\nSen. Tim Kaine (D-VA), not long before the 2024 presidential election: “This is a deeply concerning development for Venezuelans and for the entire region, since instability abroad impacts us here at home, too.”\n\nKaine, 2026: “President Trump’s unauthorized military attack on Venezuela to arrest Maduro … is a sickening return to a day when the United States asserted the right to dominate the internal political affairs of all nations in the Western Hemisphere.”\n\nIn this case, a journalist did her job after Fox News White House Correspondent Jacqui Heinrich asked Kaine the following: “If Democrats cared so much about process, why didn’t they do anything to bring Maduro to justice when they were in charge, given that the guy has been under indictment since 2020?”\n\nGood question. Kaine eventually responded after some Kamala Harris-esque word salad to say that “the Constitution does not give the president the right to initiate military action.”\n\nActually, it totally does, per legal scholars such as Fox’s Jonathan Turley: “Presidents are allowed to use military forces without such a declaration,” Turley wrote on X. Former President Barack Obama “not only killed an American citizen not charged with any crime but attacked Libya’s capital and attacked its military to cause a regime change without consulting with Congress.”\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), who never disappoints in these situations, also has a wonderful compare and contrast example for the ages.\n\nSchumer, 2020: “The president brags about his Venezuela policy. Give us a break. He hasn’t brought an end to the Maduro regime. The Maduro regime is more powerful today and more entrenched today than it was when the president began.”\n\nSchumer, 2026: “This is reckless. And the American people are just, this morning, in fear of what’s going to happen here.”\n\nThere are no words.\n\nHow about Sen. Elizabeth Warren‘s (D-MA) words back when she was running for president in 2019?\n\nWarren, 2019: “Maduro is a dictator and a crook who has wrecked his country’s economy, dismantled its democratic institutions, and profited while his people suffer. The United States should lead the international community in addressing Venezuela’s humanitarian crisis and supporting regional efforts to negotiate a political transition.”\n\nWarren, 2026: “What does it mean that the U.S. will ‘run’ Venezuela, and what will Trump do next around the world? The American people voted for lower costs, not for Trump’s dangerous military adventurism overseas that won’t make the American people safer.”\n\nYes, the same person who was the staunchest advocate for the Inflation Reduction Act has the hubris to talk about lower costs for the public. And what exactly happened to addressing Venezuela’s humanitarian crisis? Or was that the kind of empty rhetoric we’ve come to expect from our so-called leaders?\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio laid this out perfectly in a press conference held after Maduro’s capture.\n\n“I think people need to understand that this is not a president that just talks and does letters and press conferences,” Rubio told reporters on Sunday. “And if he says he’s serious about something, he means it. And this is something that was a direct threat to the national interest of the United States.”\n\nPrecisely. Just ask the Iranians or the Houthis if Trump is an all-talk-and-no-action kind of guy.\n\n“The democratic world must stand up for the rule of law in Venezuela and oppose Maduro’s assault on the electoral process and free speech. The right-wing attack on democratic institutions anywhere is a threat to freedom everywhere.” \n\n“Trump is not only violating our Constitution, but he is shredding the rules-based international order created after World War II, whose essential building block is the political sovereignty and territorial integrity of each nation.” \n\nSo, when Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) called on the “democratic world” to “stand up for the rule of law,” did that not include actually enforcing the law, as Trump did in bringing in the man that then-President Joe Biden, or whoever was running the country, had placed a $25 million bounty on? As for the “international order” Raskin speaks of, military extractions like this one have occurred numerous times since World War II, no matter who was in charge of the executive branch.\n\nPresident George H.W. Bush did seek congressional authorization before invading Panama to capture narco-terrorist Manuel Noriega in 1989.\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton did not seek congressional authorization before launching U.S. air assaults that lasted nearly three months in Yugoslavia to stop ethnic cleansing. \n\nObama did not seek congressional approval before killing Osama bin Laden in Pakistan, nor did he seek the same approval when droning and killing an American citizen abroad, along with more than 100 innocent civilians.\n\nTrump did not seek congressional authority before taking out Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani, who the U.S. military said was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of U.S. service members during the Iraq War.\n\nNow, is it important for Congress to provide oversight if a president seeks to go to war? Of course. But what happened in Venezuela was not a war. There were zero casualties on the U.S. side. Our military, much like the bombing of Iran’s nuclear facilities, had a mission, accomplished that mission, and got the hell out. Venezuela has seen no uprising since. Instead, there have been celebrations at home and here in the U.S. by those who escaped the horrors of the Maduro regime.\n\nBut Democrats keep swinging at every bad pitch. In this case, even the mayor of our nation’s largest city called Trump to voice his disdain over the capture of his fellow socialist Maduro.\n\n“I called the president and spoke with him directly to register my opposition to this act and to make clear that it was an opposition based on being opposed to a pursuit of regime change, to the violation of federal international law, and a desire to see that be consistent each and every day,” New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani said Saturday.\n\nYeah, about that “international law” thing … it basically doesn’t exist. Because a law isn’t a law if it cannot be clearly defined or if there is no actual enforcement behind it.\n\nAs for Trump’s public standing on this, according to a Washington Post poll released this week, 50% of Americans support a drug trafficking trial of Maduro, while just 14% oppose and 36% are somehow “unsure.”\n\nTrump takes action.

But there’s bipartisan concern, shared by American allies abroad, about Trump’s escalating threats to Greenland, which is part of Denmark, and which Trump and the White House have repeatedly said should be taken by the United States.\nI recently spoke by phone with Matthew Kroenig, who is a professor at Georgetown and the senior director of the Atlantic Council’s Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security, and a columnist for Foreign Policy magazine. Kroenig recently wrote a piece for the New York Times titled “Trump Was Right to Oust Maduro.” (Kroenig has worked as an adviser to Mitt Romney and Marco Rubio, and in the Pentagon during Trump’s first term.) During our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity, we discussed what Trump’s ultimate aims are in Venezuela, the possibility of an American attack on Greenland, and whether there is a danger in encouraging Trump’s bellicosity.\nWhy do you think that the move by the Trump Administration to remove Maduro was the right one?\nWell, Maduro’s a bad guy and it’s good that he’s gone is the bottom line, and he gave America’s adversaries like Russia, China, and Iran a foothold in the Western Hemisphere. He mismanaged his economy so badly that about a quarter of the population fled, contributing to a refugee crisis and pressure on the U.S.’s southern border. And he is charged with trafficking drugs into the U.S. So he was bad—bad for U.S. security, and bad for the Venezuelan people, and it’s better that he’s gone.\nDo you have some sense that the Trump Administration cares about the welfare of the Venezuelan people and the future of Venezuela? I read a piece of yours in Foreign Policy in November where you said that it’s important for the Trump Administration to try to insure that a pro-American democracy arises in Venezuela after Maduro.\nIn terms of the mismanagement of domestic politics and economics in Venezuela, there are two ways you could get somewhere better. One is a policy change and the other is a regime change. It does seem like the near-term strategy is to use carrots and sticks to encourage the current leaders in Venezuela to change policy. It is possible that the remnants of the Maduro regime could put in place the right policies—economic reforms to curb or stop drug trafficking, and to push out the Russians, the Chinese, and the Iranians—for a variety of reasons, including that they don’t want to have happen to them what happened to Maduro. But I do think over the longer term, the outcome we would want is a democratic Venezuela. As to whether the Administration cares about that—if you just look at Trump’s statements on Saturday or Rubio’s appearances on the Sunday shows, they did talk multiple times about how they were pursuing America’s interests, but also that this would be to the benefit of the Venezuelan people. [The New York Times reported on Wednesday that repression in Venezuela had ramped up, from already high levels, since Maduro’s removal, with journalists and people who celebrated Maduro’s capture being detained.]\nYou could make a utilitarian case that an invasion or a regime change will improve the lives of the Venezuelan people. That’s a little different than saying that the Trump Administration cares about democracy. Because Trump seems like he’s more interested in pursuing oil rights for American companies and whatever else.\nYeah. Well, and so again, looking at the Rubio interviews, he did talk about how democracy is the goal, but he said we have to be realistic. The opposition [to Maduro] is not in the country. These things take time.\nTrump seems like he’s soured on the opposition.\nYeah, I think that’s right. Obviously America has an Iraq and Afghanistan hangover and part of how I see the strategy is that it’s kind of correcting for some of the mistakes of Iraq and Afghanistan. And I think one of the mistakes was overpromising on democracy in places where it was not realistic. I see Rubio as trying to downplay the expectations that a Jeffersonian democracy is going to pop up overnight. But even Trump was asked about elections, and he said something, like, Well, I hope it happens quickly, but it’s a process.\nSure, but you’re a very smart guy. You know that Trump doesn’t actually care about Venezuela in terms of whether it’s a democracy or not, right?\nI think that’s fair—that he’s less focussed on values than traditional U.S. politicians.\nLess focussed. Yeah.\nYeah. Whereas I do think that Rubio does care, including because of his family background and his long record in the Senate being a supporter of democracy and human rights.\nYour Times piece does not address the fact that the person carrying this out has the qualities of Donald Trump, and that he’s also threatened a bunch of other countries in the past several days. The Administration seems to even be threatening Greenland. I’m curious if that should be part of our calculation as Americans when we wonder whether it’s a good idea for the President to order a military operation to remove a head of state.\nI guess I do see the cases as different, and you’re right that Trump has threatened adversaries and allies. But in the case of Maduro—this is a leader who has stolen an election, who’s committed human-rights abuses, who was not recognized by Joe Biden or by the European Union. And so this is kind of the easiest case. With Greenland, Denmark is a NATO ally, and it’s very hard for me to see something similar happening there. With Mexico, the President has a pretty good relationship with Claudia Sheinbaum. She and the Colombian President, Gustavo Petro, are both democratically elected. The one place where I do think there should be some concern is Cuba: Rubio was asked about this and he said, ‘Yeah, if I lived in Havana, and I was in the government, I’d be concerned.’ And, in fact, the cutting off of Venezuelan oil is already really putting a lot of pressure on the government in Cuba. So I do think this is a model that could be applied elsewhere, but I think some of the hyperventilating over the past few days that this is going to be unleashed everywhere probably goes too far.\nI know that Katie Miller, Stephen Miller’s wife, tweeted a photo of Greenland as an American property, and Trump has talked about taking Greenland. So what would be an appropriate level of hyperventilating? What’s a more appropriate way to respond when Trump says stuff like that?\nWell, I think that Trump does have a negotiating style that we saw, and he writes about it in “The Art of the Deal.”\nA businessman’s.\nYeah—that the way to get a good deal is to make outrageous demands, throw the other side off balance, and get them crawling to the table looking for a good deal. He said he would take Panama. He said NATO allies need to spend five per cent on defense, which I thought was kind of an outrageous request when he made it, but the NATO allies said O.K. So I guess I see it as part of the negotiating style. I don’t think he literally wants to take Greenland just like he didn’t literally follow through on his threat to take the Panama Canal.\nRight, it’s his business-background perspective, rather than coming at it from an international-relations, political-science type of perspective.\nYeah, I think often—many foreign-policy experts have noted this—Americans kind of negotiate against themselves. Whereas I think Trump’s style, and maybe it is from the business background, is, if he wants ten, he starts by asking for a hundred. People maybe understandably freak out because that’s not what they’re used to hearing from Presidents or diplomats.\nI haven’t glanced at “The Art of the Deal” since the 2016 campaign, and I may need to return to it. But it’s fair for people to ask about why Trump ever even conceived of threatening a NATO ally, right? It makes me wonder, just to go back to our conversation about democracy earlier, whether Trump even cares about such things as Maduro being an autocrat, or rather that he just wants to exert power.\nYeah. Well, I mean, Trump is right that Greenland is important and the Chinese are becoming more active there—I don’t know if you saw the report recently about Chinese submarines in the area. It’s also important for critical minerals. But I guess what is puzzling to me about that one is that Denmark is a NATO ally. I’ve talked to Danish officials who’ve essentially said, ‘If you want to do more in Greenland, great, let’s do it together. Let’s develop the critical minerals. You want more military access? Great. You can have it, you’re an ally.’ So I think he’s right that it’s important, but I too am puzzled why he’s going about it this way.\nIt’s definitely confusing. My concern would be that if Americans are accepting of him behaving in this way, it’s likely to encourage him further. And I’m wondering if that is a calculation that you are concerned with.\nIf that’s the case, I think that’s a good thing. I think the U.S. has been too cautious regarding the use of force, especially since Iraq and Afghanistan, because I think we’ve taken the lesson that this stuff never works, when, in fact, sometimes military force is the best option. I think of the strikes against Iran’s nuclear sites in June, when this rogue regime was about to build nuclear weapons. I do think Joe Biden or Kamala Harris probably wouldn’t have taken that shot. So it might be better if it were different, but I think it is a dangerous world and sometimes the use of American military power makes the world a better place.\nSo you’re encouraging Trump to broadly be willing to use the military, but just not in certain cases like attacking NATO allies?\n\nAnd I couldn’t tell when you talked about Cuba or Colombia whether you are more mixed about attacking them.\nWell, I think Cuba’s a little bit closer to the Maduro category. It’s been an anti-American dictatorship for decades. They’ve provided China with a listening station that’s used to spy on the U.S., and also badly mismanaged the place. The current Colombian President is not pro-American, but Colombia has been a good partner over the years. Mexico has been a good partner over the years. So I think those are normal political differences that can be settled diplomatically.\nYou worked for Marco Rubio in 2016 when he ran for President, and Mitt Romney before that. They were very critical of Trump, and said that it would be dangerous for him to be President. And I know you signed a Never Trump letter in 2016, but later said that you regretted doing so. Do you ever have those concerns about him? Or has he grown into the office?\nSince signing that letter, I’ve realized that, as a foreign-policy expert, I don’t get to appoint the President of the United States, but we have a process and the American people choose and the American people have liked Trump for more than a decade. So that’s the reality. He’s in the Oval Office. I feel like my job is to provide whoever’s there, whether it’s Biden or Trump or whoever else, my best foreign-policy advice. Weighing in on who’s fit or not for office is not really my lane.\nHas he grown into the office? I do think a lot of the stuff that we wrote about in that 2016 letter turned out not to be true, in the way that he governed in the first term. I think the foreign policy was pretty effective. He was the first President not to start new wars in a long time.\nI thought you were saying that we have actually been too unwilling to start wars since Iraq.\nWell, not to start wars, but I think the use of force in short, sharp, decisive ways, like we saw with the Iranian nuclear sites or against Maduro, does need to be an option on the table.\nBut I think the outcome of Trump’s first term’s foreign policy was over-all pretty good. George W. Bush started wars of choice without a clear strategy. Under Obama, China started taking territory in the South China Sea. Russia launched its first war against Ukraine under Obama. Russia launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine under Biden.\nWhen you turn on the TV and you see Trump, no part of you is concerned about this guy starting wars or using military force?\nAgainst Iran and Venezuela, you mean?\nJust in general. He’s the Commander-in-Chief of the most powerful military in the world.\nYeah. I like the fact that he’s not afraid to use force. I think many Presidents are self-deterred. They think it’s somehow inappropriate, but as the largest superpower, essentially, I think U.S. military power has underpinned the eighty years of peace we’ve had since the Second World War, and the threat that that could be unleashed has kept a lot of bad actors in check. So I’m glad we have a President who’s willing to use force.\nAnd you think Trump cares about any of the things you mentioned about keeping the peace?\nI was at the NATO summit in The Hague this year. And Trump’s press conference was almost sweet. He said, “These people really love their countries. It’s not a ripoff.”\nTouching, in its way.\nYeah. So these concerns that he’s going to pull out of NATO, I think nobody really has those anymore.\nWell, unless he attacks Greenland and the alliance sort of by definition falls apart.\nYeah, but again, I guess I think that’s more of the kind of bombastic rhetoric rather than a sincere statement of policy.\nIn terms of the legality of what Trump did, if we are going to talk about democracy and the importance of democracy, certainly in Venezuela, doesn’t that at least imply that we should be extra attentive to doing things with a strong legal basis, and that we have a President or Administration that speaks up for the law and democracy? You were saying that it’s important to keep China and Russia and Iran, which are three non-democratic countries, out of the hemisphere.\nYes, and we should make a distinction maybe between international and domestic law. And with regard to domestic law, there is a way to hold Presidents accountable for the uses of force overseas. You can vote them out of office. Congress can withhold funding. Congress exercises supervisory and oversight powers to call officials to testify. Congress still has the only legal ability to declare war, but, realistically, for certain types of military operations, like this one, I think the President does need some ability to order the use of force before having a big public debate. As Rubio correctly pointed out, if Trump had gone to Congress about this, it would have leaked to The New Yorker or somewhere else immediately and the operation wouldn’t have been possible.\nIt’s a tough argument to say we’re worried about non-democratic countries meddling in our hemisphere and also that we have a President who tried to overthrow the 2020 elections and quite clearly doesn’t care about democracy.\nI still think there’s a difference between President Trump and Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping. We’re not launching the biggest war in Europe trying to conquer another nation. We’re not shooting journalists in the back. We don’t have a million Muslims locked up in concentration camps. So are we comparing ourselves to—\nAbsolutely not. America is a place that I would rather live in than China or Russia, but I’m not sure Trump’s doing things for any reasons that are different from the “might makes right” of Putin. So I am concerned about that.\nMakes sense. ♦","summary":"A onetime adviser to Marco Rubio and Mitt Romney argues that the U.S. has been “too cautious” in its use of force since the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.","url":"https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/the-former-trump-skeptics-getting-behind-his-war-in-venezuela","image":"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/695ea72c5fc6a98a01abaa0c/16:9/w_2560,h_1440,c_limit/CHOTINER-VENEZUELA-TRUMPGettyImages-2253957291.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-07 18:47:02","author":"Isaac Chotiner","authors":["Isaac Chotiner"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.148},{"id":391821192,"title":"Democrats romp to victory in Virginia special elections","text":"Tuesday night brought fresh evidence that a blue wave is building for the 2026 midterm elections, after Democrats won a pair of special elections for vacant state legislative seats in Virginia.

Whether they’re spot on perfect or shockingly bad, it feels like they may come to life at any moment and kill you. With a new statue at Madame Tussauds New York, Zendaya is back in the wax figure conversation. Like all things Z, the internet absolutely has opinions on her new figure. While you’re deciding where you stand, take a look at our roundup of the best and worst Black celebrity wax figures.\n\nAhead of the 2026 Golden Globes, Zendaya is once again getting honored by Madam Tussauds, getting an all-new statue in her honor! This one was unveiled on Wednesday and was inspired by the look she wore to the Dune: Part Two fan event in Mexico City.\n\nPrior to Zendaya, Idris Elba also got his wax figure in Madam Tussauds London location. As you can clearly see by his reaction in the video above\n\n At this point Rih has enough wax figures to start her terrifying, yet fierce, bad girl army. The newest addition is located at Madame Tussauds Hong Kong and is wearing a matching FENTY orange dress and trench coat. It’s based on a look the Grammy winner wore in February 2020 to the launch of FENTY at Bergdorf Goodman in New York.\n\n The Hollywood Wax Museum in Pigeon Forge, Tenn. did not do rap legend Lil Wayne any favors with its figure. It looks nothing like him. It’s more like they had an old Steph Curry one in the storage room and tried to repurpose it. The “A Milli” artist weighed in on the creation, posting, “Sorry wax museum but dat shit ain’t me! You tried tho and I appreciate the effort.” Yeah, they need to go back to the drawing board on this one.\n\nDwayne Johnson\n\n The Rock was involved in creating his Madame Tussauds figure, which is why it looks just like him. The Musee Grevin in Paris clearly went a different way, leading to widespread internet mockery of its figure. It looks like they started out doing Mr. Clean and tried to turn it into Dwayne Johnson. The man himself had to weigh in on Instagram, writing, “I’m going to have my team reach out to our friends at Grevin Museum, in Paris France so we can work at ‘updating’ my wax figure here with some important details and improvements- starting with my skin color.” Come on guys, he’s the biggest movie star in the world! Do better.\n\nMadame Tussauds New York is celebrating Queen Bey’s record-breaking Renaissance tour with a new wax figure featuring her iconic 2018 Coachella Homecoming look.\n\nBilly Porter\n\nThe Emmy winner’s wax figure at Madame Tussauds New York is identical to the Pose star and showcases his memorable blue jumpsuit and curtain from the 2020 Grammys.\n\nTupac Shakur\n\nFresh off being honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, Tupac is being celebrated at home, in Oakland, Calif. With the return of his wax figure to Madame Tussauds San Francisco. The rap legend’s figure was one of the first added to the Northern California location in 2014 and has also been featured in the Hollywood museum. When it was originally created, the figure took artists six months to bring to life.\n\nKamala Harris\n\nVice President Harris’ term is full of firsts. Though we’re betting that being the first US Vice President with a wax figure at Madame Tussauds New York was probably not on her radar.\n\nKamala Harris’ Wax Figure\n\nDwayne Johnson\n\n The Rock looks like he was chiseled out of actual stone, so it makes perfect sense that he has four wax figures. They are featured at Madame Tussauds New York, Hollywood, Las Vegas, and Orlando. They look so much like him, I’m waiting for one to hit a Rock Bottom on somebody. \n\nDwayne Johnson’s Wax Figure\n\nWhile no wax figure can imitate Lil Nas X’s effervescent personality, his statue is a spot on replica of the Grammy-winner. In fact, it was so well done, he pranked his friends by using the figure to FaceTime them.\n\nThe “Diamonds” singer has multiple wax figures at various museums around the world. Her newest one, based on her 2018 Met Gala look, can be found at Madame Tussauds New York. She will also have a figure based on her Super Bowl LVII look revealed later in the year at Madame Tussauds Orlando.\n\nRihanna’s Wax Figure\n\nAngela Bassett\n\nHonestly, if Angela Bassett ever needs to take a break from photo lines or has to do a dangerous stunt on 9-1-1, she can just send in her figure. The resemblance is spooky.\n\nAngela Bassett’s Wax Figure\n\nJennifer Hudson\n\nThe EGOT-winner’s statue is at Madame Tussauds New York – Times Square. The talk show host participated in a “sitting” where “more than 200 measurements were taken to capture the singer and actor’s exact features.” Having her involvement in the figure’s creation certainly made all the difference.\n\nJennifer Hudson’s Wax Figure\n\nThere’s only one Beyoncé. However, this version from Madame Tussaud’s Berlin is probably the best figure we’ve seen of Queen Bey.\n\nBeyoncé’s Wax Figure\n\nNicki Minaj\n\nWhen Nicki Minaj’s wax figure was unveiled in 2015 at Madame Tussaud’s Las Vegas, fans were immediately upset about the fact that a Black woman was put in a questionable position. Mirroring a scene from her “Anaconda” video, she was on all fours, with her butt in the air. The pose inspired visitors to take sexually suggestive photos. Turns out Nicki was in on the whole process and was fine with the figure.\n\nNicki Minaj’s Wax Figure\n\nNaomi Campbell\n\n Naomi Campbell is one of the most beautiful women in the world. Seems like it would be a slam dunk to make her look gorgeous. Somehow Musee Grevin in Paris managed to mess it up.\n\nNaomi Campbell’s Wax Figure\n\nMichael Jackson\n\nMichael Jackson had several different looks in his long career, so there have been countless figures made of the superstar. The more recent ones seem to look more like him, as artists always had problems with his darker skin tone.\n\nMichael Jackson’s Wax Figure\n\nThe Grammy-winner just unveiled her figure at Madame Tussauds Las Vegas in January, The interactive display is based on her 2019 BET Awards performance and sits on top of a giant wedding cake.\n\nLizzo’s Wax Figure\n\nLeBron James\n\nLet’s be honest: LeBron totally wishes he had the hair his wax figure at the Museo de Cera in Mexico City has.\n\nLeBron James’ Wax Figure\n\nThis statue of America’s favorite weatherman isn’t that bad, but no wax figure will ever capture Al Roker’s infectious positivity and enthusiasm.\n\nAl Roker’s Wax Figure\n\nSerena Williams\n\n This is very close and Serena seems happy with the finished product. But, if I’m being honest, the Madame Tussauds New York figure looks more like Venus than Serena.\n\nSerena Williams’ Wax Figure\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex\n\nMadame Tussaud’s London has a whole Royal Family display. When they decided to step down as senior royals, the museum removed Harry and Meghan from the attraction. However, in 2022 the couple was back in the picture.

I try my best not to let it bother me. Especially the past year, since he's become President, I've had to learn that, yes, they're following me, but also to focus in pretending that they're not there. \n\n'Obviously, they are there. But if you can try to not really focus on that and enjoy your time with your friends, your family or whatever it is - it makes it easier. \n\n'Because for the first few months, it was tough. It was not easy having someone following you all the time. But once I was like: \"Their only job is to protect me. I'm going to focus on my stuff and have them do their job\". It made it so much easier.'\n\nElsewhere on the podcast, the 18-year-old seemingly extended an olive branch to Trump's former rival Kamala Harris and said there is no 'bad blood' between them.\n\nWhen asked by WWE star Paul about her opinions on Harris, she said: 'To be honest with you, I stay out of politics completely. Like, I would never run and I don't want anything to do with politics. \n\n'I feel like politics is such a dangerous thing and I think if both sides met in the middle everyone would be so much more happier and I think there's radical left, there's radical right and there's a lot of people who get too extreme.\n\n'And that's where social media really ties into it because social media kind of makes your Instagram or your feed be one way or the other and there's not a lot of things on social media if you're very much in the middle. \n\n'I think that kind of makes some people crazy and some people buy into it too much. I think that's like the best way to say it. There's no bad blood. I'm very much in the middle. It is what it is, they ran against each other.'\n\nFinally, the budding golfer ended by offering an insight into Trump's presidential future, as podcast host Paul pressed her on the possibility of her grandfather standing for a third term. \n\nThe teenager admitted that he has no plans to run again but left the door open by admitting 'a lot could happen until 2028'. \n\nShe said: 'He's not running for a third term. Sadly not. But who knows? A lot could happen until 2028'.\n\nHer appearance on the podcast came just days after she kick-started 2026 in major style, spending time with Rory McIlroy on the driving range.\n\nThe 18-year-old posted footage of the Masters champion ripping a drive on the range before sharing a picture of herself alongside only the sixth man to complete golf's Grand Slam.\n\n'Best way to start the year,' Kai wrote alongside the picture.\n\nMcIlroy, of course, isn't the only golfer whose expertise the teenager is able to tap into. Her mother, Vanessa, is dating Tiger Woods - their relationship was exclusively revealed by the Daily Mail back in March.\n\nKai has a big 2026 ahead of her. She will be joining the University of Miami as a part of the 2026 signing class to play collegiate golf. She committed to the school in August.","summary":"The 18-year-old opened up in her first-ever podcast interview about the pressures of high-profile family and her surprising stance on her grandfather's political rivals.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/golf/article-15440657/kai-trump-kamala-harris-donald-trump-podcast.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2026/01/07/03/105293307-0-image-m-18_1767758383939.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2026/01/07/5111773666729572371/1024x576_MP4_5111773666729572371.mp4","publish_date":"2026-01-07 18:22:06","author":"Editor,James Cohen","authors":["Editor","James Cohen"],"language":"en","source_country":"jp","sentiment":-0.104}]}
