The S&P 500 has fallen 10 percent since its peak on February 19, which investors term a ‘correction.’\n\nThe plunge is the seventh-fastest correction since records began after the Wall Street crash of 1929.\n\nFink, who has an estimated net worth of $1.2 billion, said that the Trump administration’s barrage of policy changes is paralyzing American consumers and businesses, CNN reported. \n\n‘The collective impact in the short run is that people are pausing, they’re pulling back,’ he told the outlet. \n\n‘Talking to CEOs throughout the economy, I hear that the economy is weakening as we speak.’\n\nThe administration has also been aggressively laying off federal workers across many departments. \n\nFink said the uncertainty sowed by these dramatic changes is unsettling companies and federal workers, and it remains to be seen what effect this could have long term.\n\n‘All of these things have that ripple effect, and we will see over a long cycle whether this ripple effect gets worse or does it stabilize,’ he said. \n\nHowever he added that he was still ‘very bullish on America,’ and said that the administration’s policies, including tariffs, could be beneficial for the economy over time. \n\n‘Right now the president is focusing on tariffs, but when he talks about reciprocal tariffs, actually, that may bring down tariffs over the long run.’\n\nFink has previously faced backlash from Republican-led states over his company’s climate targets. \n\nBut he reportedly spoke to the President directly to discuss BlackRock’s purchase of two Panama Canal ports which would shift them into American hands, according to Fortune. \n\nTrump has pledged to seize the Panama Canal, which is a key waterway that facilitates hundreds of billions of dollars of trade annually.\n\n‘The decision was purely economic, and we believe this is going to be great long term investment,’ Fink told CNN. \n\n‘My conversation with the president was positive, it was optimistic… but if it was four months earlier, I would have been calling the prior administration.’ \n\nJPMorgan CEO Dimon, meanwhile, who is worth an estimated $2.3 billion, appeared to change his tune by expressing his concerns about the impact of tariffs in an interview with Semafor on Wednesday. \n\n‘I don’t think the average American consumer who wakes up in the morning and goes to work… changes what they’re going to do because they read about tariffs,’ he said.\n\n‘But I do think companies might. Uncertainty is not a good thing.’\n\nDimon has had a bumpy relationship with the President in the past. \n\nHe was forced to publicly deny that he had endorsed Trump during his presidential campaign in October, and reportedly privately backed his rival Kamala Harris.\n\nBut Dimon surprised some people when he was originally asked about tariffs in January at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. \n\n‘If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it. I mean, get over it,’ Dimon told CNBC at the time.\n\n‘National security trumps a little bit more inflation.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nBillionaires Jamie Dimon and Larry Fink have both begun to express their&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Prominent American billionaires criticize Trump: &#8216;The economy is getting weaker right now&#8217; first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/prominent-american-billionaires-criticize-trump-the-economy-is-getting-weaker-right-now/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/14/16/96202075-14499229-JPMorgan_Chase_CEO_Dimon_who_has_had_a_bumpy_relationship_with_t-a-7_1741971536543.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-15 00:46:49","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.034},{"id":300339856,"title":"Tim Walz Bounces Back from 2024 Defeat with a Town Hall in an Iowa Republican’s District","text":"DES MOINES, Iowa – Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz stood before hundreds of Iowans on Friday and admitted he doesn’t have all the answers about issues facing the country.\n\n“If I did, we wouldn’t be in this goddamn mess,” Walz said.\n\nWalz is back on the road to talk to voters, but he’s no longer a vice presidential candidate. He isn’t any kind of candidate, at least not for now.\n\nWalz is reemerging after last year’s election loss, granting interviews to national media and speaking to hundreds attending the Montana Democratic Party’s annual dinner earlier this month.\n\nNow, he’s kicking off a tour of town halls in competitive congressional districts represented by Republicans, launched by a post on social media in response to guidance from House Speaker Mike Johnson that GOP representatives skip out on town halls, saying demonstrations outside of them were the work of “professional protesters.”\n\n“There’s a responsibility in this time of chaos where elected officials need to hear what people are irritated about,” Walz said. “And I would argue that Democratic officials should hear the primal scream that’s coming from America and do something.”\n\nWalz said he wasn’t there to personally attack U.S. Rep. Zach Nunn, whose district includes the high school auditorium that nearly 1,000 people filled on Friday. But Walz called on Nunn to answer questions in public. Nunn won reelection in Iowa’s 3rd congressional district by about 4 percentage points in 2024, a margin of just under 16,000 voters.\n\nThe Iowa Democratic Party got Walz’s call Monday evening and got to work planning the event Tuesday, said Paige Godden, the state party’s communications director.\n\nThe crowd gave Walz a standing ovation. Many were wearing shirts with messages of political activism. A schoolteacher, a high school senior and a VA medical center worker asked Walz questions about health care, financial aid and funding for veterans.\n\nMike Suggett of Pleasant Hill, just east of Des Moines, is a retired schoolteacher who said he taught Nunn in junior high school. He’s written to the lawmaker but said he gets “canned form letters” in return. Suggett said Nunn is “too much of a coward” to show up.\n\n“We’d much prefer to hear from the people who represent us,” Suggett said.\n\nIn an emailed statement to The Associated Press, Nunn said he’s held “hundreds of listening sessions” to hear directly from Iowans and is delivering on the change “Iowans voted for in November.”\n\n“While out-of-state Democrats hold fundraisers disguised as forums, we’re focused on real results,” he said.\n\nOther Republican leaders in Iowa and Minnesota, including Gov. Kim Reynolds, criticized the visit and said Walz should focus on his own state. Emily Tuttle, spokesperson for the National Republican Campaign Committee, called it a “manufactured production.”\n\nWalz stopped in Iowa several times in 2023 as a surrogate for then-President Joe Biden, floating around the state fair, fundraising for local Democrats and holding media availabilities to contrast Biden with the Republican candidates campaigning in the run-up to Iowa’s GOP caucuses.\n\nHe goes Saturday to Nebraska, where he grew up, with tentative stops to follow in Minnesota, Wisconsin and Ohio. The focus on Midwest neighbors and states in the Rust Belt isn’t a coincidence — many of them are places Walz didn’t visit during last year’s shortened campaign after Biden dropped out and made way for Vice President Kamala Harris atop the Democratic ticket.\n\nWalz passed on running for Senate next year but could be a contender for the 2028 presidential nomination.\n\nOn 2024’s outcome, Walz said Democrats “need to acknowledge” that some voters didn’t see a difference between the Republican and Democratic presidential tickets and that the Democrats’ message on issues like immigration and Social Security didn’t resonate. He said he’s listening to learn why.\n\nAndrea Smith, a veteran, and her 19-year-old daughter, Liberty, said they were already going to be in Des Moines — about 120 miles from home in West Branch — to rally for veteran’s rights, and they decided to stay to see Walz.\n\n“We related a lot to him,” Liberty Smith said. “He felt real during the election season.”\n\nShowing up to the Walz event was May Dehaan’s way of trying to get Nunn to notice that his constituents are frustrated. She wore a shirt that read: “This is not normal.”\n\n“Obviously, he’s not listening to his constituents. He’s following the GOP talking points.” said Dehaan, a retired interior designer from suburban Clive, who has herself written to Nunn. “We’re getting tired of being ignored.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nDES MOINES, Iowa – Minnesota Gov.

Once there, astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore will finally be able to return to Earth at some point on or shortly after March 19.\n\nThe pair have been stranded in orbit since June 5, with SpaceX owner Elon Musk and many others claiming Williams and Wilmore were left on the ISS for political reasons. \n\nThe duo were initially scheduled for an eight day mission. \n\nMusk said he offered to bring the astronauts home eight months ago, but the Biden Administration shot it down because it would've made Donald Trump 'look good' in the presidential race against former vice president Kamala Harris. \n\nThe successful takeoff comes after the Crew-10 mission was scrubbed on the launch pad due to mechanical issues just minutes before launch on Wednesday.\n\nCrew-10 includes NASA astronauts Anne McClain and Nichole Ayers, Japan's Takuya Onishi, and Russia's Kirill Peskov.\n\n'Spaceflight is tough, but humans are tougher,' McClain said minutes into the flight. \n\nThe new crew will spend the next six months at the space station, considered the normal stint. \n\nAlongside Williams and Wilmore, NASA's Nick Hague and Russia's Aleksandr Gorbunov will be returning home on board SpaceX's Crew-9 Dragon capsule that is already docked at the ISS.\n\nLast year's presidential race seems to be at the heart of why the astronauts have been stuck in space so long. \n\nMusk backed Trump during the 2024 presidential race, donating $288 million to his campaign and appearing at several MAGA rallies\n\nDuring a recent press briefing, Ken Bowersox, associate administrator of the NASA's Space Operations Mission Directorate, admitted that there 'may have been conversations' in the Biden White House about delaying the return for political optics of having Trump's most famous donor save the day, but he was not part of the discussions.\n\nWednesday's Crew-10 launch was called off due to a hydraulic system issue with the Falcon 9 rocket. NASA said teams were working to address the problem.\n\nNASA had moved up the return mission by two weeks after after President Trump told Musk to 'go get' Williams and Wilmore. \n\nBefore the president's request, the astronauts were not coming back earlier than March 26. \n\n'It's been a roller coaster for them, probably a little bit more so than for us,' Williams said of her family. \n\n'We're here, we have a mission - we're just doing what we do every day, and every day is interesting because we're up in space and it's a lot of fun.' \n\nWhen the new crew arrives aboard the station, Wilmore, Williams, Nick Hague, and Aleksandr Gorbunov can return to Earth in the capsule that has been attached to the station since September.\n\nWilmore and Williams flew to the ISS as the first test crew of Boeing's Starliner, which suffered propulsion system issues in space.\n\nNASA deemed it too risky for the astronauts to fly home on the Boeing craft. This led to the current plan to bring them home in a SpaceX capsule that arrived in September.\n\nThe space agency gave Boeing $4.5 billion contract to develop Starliner in a bid to compete with Musk's SpaceX.\n\nBowersox said that SpaceX 'helped with a lot of options' for bringing Williams and Wilmore back earlier, but the final decision came down to costs.\n\nHe explained that they discussed adding a mission or bringing the currently docked capsule home early, 'but we ruled them out pretty quickly just based on how much money we've got in our budget.' \n\nNASA's budget for the fiscal year 2024 comes in at just under $30 billion.\n\nIt comes after a report found the agency spent millions on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) grants and contracts while Williams and Wilmore have been stuck in space.\n\nBill Gerstenmaier, vice president for SpaceX, also said that NASA's delayed plan allowed the agency 'to use Sunny and Butch in a very productive manner' and 'keep the science going.'\n\nReturning the astronauts early would've meant fewer bodies on the International Space Station (ISS) to continue research.","summary":"The SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket successfully took off Friday night from NASA's Kennedy Space Center, on a mission to deliver four new astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS).","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-14500361/SpaceX-launches-relief-mission-stranded-NASA-astronauts-elon-musk.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/14/23/96214761-0-image-m-25_1741995831571.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/03/05/6695064963204401068/1024x576_MP4_6695064963204401068.mp4","publish_date":"2025-03-14 23:45:39","author":"Chris Melore,Editor","authors":["Chris Melore","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"GB","sentiment":-0.323},{"id":300330176,"title":"Trump accuses the press of ‘illegal’ reporting in Justice Department remarks","text":"Donald Trump continued his assault on the press in front of the nation’s top federal law enforcement officials on Friday while taking a victory lap against a justice system that failed to hold him to account.\n\nIn remarks at the Department of Justice, which presidents typically avoid to preserve the independence of the work of law enforcement agencies, Trump labelled news outlets with adversarial coverage of his administration “political arms of the Democratic party.”\n\nCNN and MSNBC “literally write 97.6 percent bad about me” and are “political arms of the Democrat Party,” Trump said.\n\n“In my opinion they’re really corrupt and they’re illegal. What they do is illegal,” he said.\n\nHe also listed off a list of what he called “fake news” outlets including The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, baselessly alleging they are conspiring with Democratic officials to influence prosecutions and investigations against him.\n\n“It’s totally illegal what they do,” he said.\n\nHe suggested that press coverage that criticized judges influenced their decisions in cases against him and should be “illegal.” Trump himself, however, continues to rage against judges that have blocked parts of his agenda, while his allies call for their impeachment and removal from the bench.\n\nNewspapers “are really no different than a highly paid political operative,” Trump said.\n\n“And it has to stop. It has to be illegal,” he said. “It’s influencing judges. It’s really changing law. And it just cannot be legal. I do not believe it is legal.”\n\nThe president spent his three presidential campaigns and first four years in office raging against a free press he calls “fake news” and the “enemy of the people” while waging a legal war against the media in courtrooms across the country.\n\nHe repeatedly threatened to revoke broadcast licenses for news networks over critical coverage or stories he didn’t like and then sued top networks for defamation. He is currently trying to force CBS to pay him $10 billion over a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris he claims was edited to illegally influence the outcome of the 2024 presidential election.\n\nTrump’s attorneys also made legal threats to The Daily Beast, The New York Times and Penguin Random House while Trump demanded that congressional Republicans block a bipartisan bill intended to safeguard confidential sources, what civil rights groups have called the most significant measure for press freedoms in modern history.\n\nIn office, Trump’s Federal Communications Commission’s chair Brendan Carr has launched probes into public broadcasting services NPR and PBS and revived complaints into CBS, ABC, and NBC – but has not touched any explicitly right-wing news outlets.\n\nHis allies, meanwhile, are asking the Supreme Court to toss long-standing, landmark precedent that has shielded the press from defamation lawsuits over their coverage of public officials. Trump has tried, and failed, to make the same argument in several lawsuits against news outlets.\n\nTrump’s administration is also moving control of the press pool that follows the president’s daily travel and activities into the White House, which has also invited far-right media personalities into briefings.\n\nThe White House also has effectively barred the Associated Press from closely following White House events after the global news agency refused to adopt the name “Gulf of America” instead of the Gulf of Mexico, the name that most of the world continues to recognize.\n\nWhile condemning what he characterized as the “weaponization” of a Justice Department that handled investigations into allegations of election interference and obstruction, Trump turned to the officials in front of him to suggest they must face the “scum” that is challenging him now.\n\nHe called his criminal defense attorneys Todd Blanche and Emil Bove — now top Justice Department officials — “warriors” for him in his criminal cases.\n\nHe then called a prominent attorney and legal analyst who has been critical of his agenda “vicious and violent.”\n\nLawyers who have opposed his agenda are “horrible people, they’re scum, and you have to know that,” he told them.","summary":"Trump argues that press criticism of judges should be criminalized despite the president and his allies’ ongoing attacks against the judiciary","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-illegal-justice-department-speech-b2715527.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/14/22/52/U-S--President-Donald-Trump-meets-Department-of-Justice-workers-in-Washington-yid8aj2w.jpeg?trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/qwed3U1Y-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-03-14 22:39:02","author":"Alex Woodward","authors":["Alex Woodward"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.052},{"id":300326442,"title":"Why was it so hard for the GOP to pass its spending bill?","text":"Facing a threat of imminent government shutdown, nine Democrats joined GOP Senate colleagues to defeat a filibuster, moving a six-month government funding bill to final passage in a late-day vote on March 14, 2025. \n\nSince January 2025, Republicans in Washington have enjoyed what’s commonly known as a governing “trifecta”: control over the executive branch via the president, combined with majorities for their party in both the House and the Senate. \n\nYou might think that a trifecta, which is also referred to as “unified government” by political scientists, is a clear recipe for easy legislative success. In theory, when political parties have unified control over the House, the Senate and the presidency, there should be less conflict between them. Because these politicians are part of the same political party and have the same broad goals, it seems like they should be able to get their agenda approved, and the opposing minority party can do little to stop them. \n\nBut not all trifectas are created equal, and not all are dominant. And several weaknesses in the Republicans’ trifecta made passing their six-month stopgap spending bill so difficult, and they help explain why the federal government came so close to shutting down completely.\n\nResearch shows that political gridlock can still happen even under a unified government for reasons that have been on display ever since Republicans assumed leadership of Congress and the presidency in January.\n\nMajority size matters\n\nA unified government clearly makes President Donald Trump’s ability to enact his agenda much easier than if, for example, Democrats controlled the U.S. House, as they did during the second half of his first term, from 2021-2022. But tight margins in both congressional chambers have meant that, even with a trifecta, it hasn’t been an easy. \n\nTrump was the sixth consecutive president with a trifecta on Day 1 of his second term. But history – and simple math – show that presidents with trifectas have an easier time passing partisan legislation with bigger majorities. Bigger majorities mean majority-party defections won’t easily sink controversial or partisan legislation. A bigger majority also means that individual members of Congress from either party have less leverage to water down the president’s policy requests.\n\nTrump also held a trifecta during the beginning of his first term in office; in particular, a big Republican majority in the House, which passed major legislation with relative ease and put pressure on Senate colleagues to comply. Trump signed a major tax reform package in 2017 that was the signature legislative achievement of his first term.\n\nBut Trump has a much smaller advantage this time. \n\nEvery president since Bill Clinton has entered office with a trifecta, but Trump’s seat advantage in the House on Day 1 of his second term was the smallest of all of them. This slim House margin meant that Republicans could afford to lose only a handful of their party’s votes on their spending bill in order for it to pass over unanimous Democratic opposition.\n\nAnd Trump’s relatively small advantage in the Senate meant that Republicans needed at least eight Democratic votes to break a filibuster. Nine Democrats ultimately voted to advance the bill to final passage.\n\nMajority party troubles\n\nIn addition to opposition from Democrats in Congress, Trump and other Republican leaders have continued to confront internal divisions within their own party. \n\nIn a closely divided House or Senate, there are plenty of tools that Democrats, even as the minority party, can use to stymie Trump’s agenda. This most notably includes the filibuster, which would have forced Republicans to garner 60 votes for their short-term spending bill. A small proportion of Democrats ultimately bailed out Senate Republicans in this case; but any major defections within the GOP would have required even more Democratic support, which Republicans were unlikely to get.**\n\nEven dominant legislative trifectas, again like the one former President Barack Obama enjoyed when he took office in 2009, can’t prevent divisions within political parties, as different politicians jockey for control of the party’s agenda. \n\nDespite entering office with a 17-vote advantage in the Senate, 11 more than Trump enjoys now, Obama’s signature legislative achievement – the Affordable Care Act, also sometimes known as Obamacare – had to be watered down significantly to win a simple majority after backlash from conservative Democrats. \n\nObama’s trifecta was bigger in size; but in a polarized America, a large majority also means an ideologically diverse one.\n\nJust as Republican leaders did in the last Congress, Trump has faced similar pushback behind the scenes and in public from members of his own party in his second term. For the past two years, the Republican-led House has been repeatedly riven by leadership struggles and an often aimless legislative agenda, thanks to a lack of cooperation from the the party’s far-right flank. \n\nThis group of ideologically driven lawmakers remains large enough to stall any party-line vote that Speaker Mike Johnson hopes to pass, and the spending bill very nearly fell victim to this kind of defection. \n\nEven though the GOP squeaked out a win on this spending bill, the potential for continued chaos is monumental, especially if Trump pursues more major reform to policy areas such as immigration.\n\nCompeting pressures\n\nDespite Congress’ reputation as a polarized partisan body, members of Congress ultimately serve multiple masters. The lingering Republican divisions that made it so difficult to pass this resolution reflect the competing pressures of national party leaders in Washington and the local politics of each member’s district, which often cut against what party leaders want.\n\nFor example, some Republicans represent heavily Republican districts and will be happy to go along with Trump’s agenda, regardless of how extreme it is. Others represent districts won by Kamala Harris in 2024 and might be more inclined to moderate their positions to keep their seats in 2026 and beyond. There admittedly aren’t many of this latter group; but likely enough to sink any party-line legislation Speaker Johnson has in mind.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nRepublicans managed to pass a hurried, stopgap spending bill on March 14, 2025 only by the skin of their teeth. Failing to do so would have driven the federal government into shutdown mode. Small margins, internal divisions and conflicting electoral pressures will continue to make legislating difficult over the next two years or more.\n\nThanks to these complications, it may be that congressional Republicans will continue to rely on the executive branch, including Elon Musk and the efforts at the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to do the policymaking for them, even if it means handing over their own legislative power to Trump. \n\nThis is an updated version of a story first published on Nov. 19, 2024.","summary":"Without Democratic votes to break a Senate filibuster, the GOP would not have been able to pass its stopgap spending bill and avert a government shutdown.","url":"https://theconversation.com/why-was-it-so-hard-for-the-gop-to-pass-its-spending-bill-252257","image":"https://images.theconversation.com/files/655451/original/file-20250314-56-8cwpv7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=62%2C0%2C5389%2C2694&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-14 22:26:19","author":"Assistant Professor of Political Science,Boise State University,Charlie Hunt","authors":["Assistant Professor of Political Science","Boise State University","Charlie Hunt"],"language":"en","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.161},{"id":300318212,"title":"World News | Trump Pledges to 'expel Rogue Actors' in Political Speech at Justice Department","text":"Washington, Mar 15 (AP) US President Donald Trump used a triumphant visit to the Justice Department on Friday to air a litany of grievances about the criminal investigations that threatened to torpedo his political career, decrying in often profane terms his adversaries and casting himself as a victim of unfair and biased prosecutions. The speech was meant to rally support for Trump's tough-on-crime agenda. But it also functioned as victory lap after he emerged legally and politically unscathed from two federal prosecutions that were dismissed after his election win last fall.

The venue selection for the speech underscores Trump's keen interest in the department and desire to exert influence over it following criminal investigations that shadowed his first four years in office and subsequent campaign. The visit, the first by Trump and the first by any president in a decade, brought him into the belly of an institution he has disparaged in searing terms for years but one that he has sought to reshape by installing loyalists and members of his personal defence team in top leadership positions. \"We will expel the rogue actors and corrupt forces from our government. We will expose, very much expose their egregious crimes and severe misconduct of which was levels never seen anything like it,\" Trump said in a wide-ranging speech that touched on everything from Russia's war against Ukraine to the price of eggs.

And going to also be legendary for the people that are able to seek it out and bring justice. We will restore the scales of justice in America, and we will ensure that such abuses never happen again in our country.\" Although there is some precedent for presidents to speak to the Justice Department workforce from the building's ceremonial Great Hall, Trump's trip two months into his second term was particularly striking because of his unique status as a onetime criminal defendant indicted by the agency he is now poised to address and because his remarks are likely to feature an airing of grievances over his exposure to the criminal justice system -- including an FBI search in 2022 of his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, for classified documents. Trump's visit also comes at a time when Attorney General Pam Bondi has asserted that the department needs to be depoliticised even as critics assert agency leadership is injecting politics into the decision-making process. The relationship between presidents and Justice Department leaders has waxed and waned over the decades depending on the personalities of the officeholders and the sensitivity of the investigations that have dominated the day. The dynamic between President Joe Biden, a Democrat, and his attorney general, Merrick Garland, was known to be fraught in part because of special counsel investigations that Garland oversaw into Biden's mishandling of classified information and into the firearms and tax affairs of his son Hunter. When it comes to setting its agenda, the Justice Department historically takes a cue from the White House but looks to maintain its independence on individual criminal investigations. Trump has upended such norms. He encouraged specific investigations during his first term and tried to engineer the firing of Robert Mueller, the special counsel assigned to investigate ties between Russia and Trump's 2016 campaign. He also endured difficult relationships with his first two handpicked attorneys general -- Jeff Sessions was fired immediately after the 2018 midterm election, and William Barr resigned weeks after publicly disputing Trump's bogus claims of widespread fraud in the 2020 election. Arriving for a second term in January, fresh off a landmark Supreme Court opinion that reaffirmed a president's unshakable control of the Justice Department, Trump has appeared determined to clear from his path any potential obstacles, including by appointing Bondi -- a former Florida attorney general who was part of Trump's defence team at his first impeachment trial -- and Kash Patel, another close ally, to serve as his FBI director. At her January confirmation hearing, Bondi appeared to endorse Trump's false claims of mass voter fraud in 2020 by refusing to answer directly whether Trump had lost to Biden. She also echoed his position that he had been unfairly \"targeted\" by the Justice Department despite the wealth of evidence prosecutors say they amassed. She regularly praises him in Fox News Channel appearances and proudly noted that she had removed portraits of Biden, Garland and Vice President Kamala Harris from a Justice Department wall upon arriving. \"We all adore Donald Trump, and we want to protect him and fight for his agenda. And the people of America overwhelmingly elected him for his agenda,\" Bondi said in a recent Fox interview with Trump's daughter-in-law Lara Trump. Even before Bondi had been confirmed, the Justice Department fired department employees who served on special counsel Jack Smith's team, which charged Trump with plotting to overturn the 2020 election and with hoarding classified documents at Mar-a-Lago. Both cases were dismissed last November in line with longstanding Justice Department policy against indicting sitting presidents. Officials also demanded from the FBI lists of thousands of employees who worked on investigations into the January 6, 2021, riot at the US Capitol, when a mob of Trump's supporters stormed the building in an effort to halt the certification of the electoral vote, and fired prosecutors who had participated in the cases. And they have ordered the dismissal of a criminal case against New York Mayor Eric Adams by saying the charges had handicapped the Democrat's ability to partner in the Republican administration's fight against illegal immigration.

The speech was meant to rally support for Trump's tough-on-crime agenda. But it also functioned as victory lap after he emerged legally and politically unscathed from two federal prosecutions that were dismissed after his election win last fall. The venue selection for the speech underscores Trump's keen interest in the department and desire to exert influence over it following criminal investigations that shadowed his first four years in office and subsequent campaign. The visit, the first by Trump and the first by any president in a decade, brought him into the belly of an institution he has disparaged in searing terms for years but one that he has sought to reshape by installing loyalists and members of his personal defense team in top leadership positions. “We will expel the rogue actors and corrupt forces from our government. We will expose, very much expose their egregious crimes and severe misconduct of which was levels never seen anything like it,\" Trump said in a wide-ranging speech that touched on topics including Russia's war against Ukraine and the price of eggs. \"It’s going to be legendary.

Trump's visit also comes at a time when Atty. Gen. Pam Bondi has asserted that the department needs to be depoliticized even as critics assert agency leadership is injecting politics into the decision-making process. The relationship between presidents and Justice Department leaders has waxed and waned over the decades depending on the personalities of the officeholders and the sensitivity of the investigations that have dominated the day. The dynamic between President Biden, a Democrat, and his attorney general, Merrick Garland, was known to be fraught in part because of special counsel investigations that Garland oversaw into Biden's mishandling of classified information and into the firearms and tax affairs of his son Hunter. When it comes to setting its agenda, the Justice Department historically takes a cue from the White House but looks to maintain its independence on individual criminal investigations. Trump has upended such norms. He encouraged specific investigations during his first term and tried to engineer the firing of Robert Mueller, the special counsel assigned to investigate ties between Russia and Trump's 2016 campaign. He also endured difficult relationships with his first two handpicked attorneys general — Jeff Sessions was fired immediately after the 2018 midterm election, and William Barr resigned weeks after publicly disputing Trump's bogus claims of widespread fraud in the 2020 election. Arriving for a second term in January fresh off a landmark Supreme Court opinion that reaffirmed a president's unshakable control of the Justice Department, Trump has appeared determined to clear from his path any potential obstacles, including by appointing Bondi — a former Florida attorney general who was part of Trump’s defense team at his first impeachment trial — and Kash Patel, another close ally, to serve as his FBI director. At her January confirmation hearing, Bondi appeared to endorse Trump's false claims of mass voter fraud in 2020 by refusing to answer directly whether Trump had lost to Biden. She also echoed his position that he had been unfairly “targeted” by the Justice Department despite the wealth of evidence prosecutors say they amassed. She regularly praises him in Fox News Channel appearances and proudly noted that she had removed portraits of Biden, Garland and Vice President Kamala Harris from a Justice Department wall upon arriving. “We all adore Donald Trump, and we want to protect him and fight for his agenda. And the people of America overwhelmingly elected him for his agenda,” Bondi said in a recent Fox interview with Trump's daughter-in-law, Lara Trump. Even before Bondi had been confirmed, the Justice Department fired department employees who served on special counsel Jack Smith's team, which charged Trump with plotting to overturn the 2020 election and with hoarding classified documents at Mar-a-Lago.

Clarke, in which the nuclear-powered Discovery spacecraft traveled to Jupiter.\n\nBut perhaps the most far-reaching news came in President Donald Trump’s March 4 State of the Union address when he stated, “We are going to conquer the vast frontiers of science, and we are going to lead humanity into space and plant the American flag on the planet Mars and even far beyond.”\n\nIt is that last phrase, “…and even far beyond,” that is potentially of historic importance, as it appears to commit the United States to achieving a manned presence — “plant the American flag” — on space bodies, be they planets, Moons or asteroids, that are “beyond” Mars and into our solar system.\n\nWhile Trump’s statement does not preclude early reliance on unmanned probes and then unmanned landers to “plant the American flag” and conduct early research, even to return distant planetary and lunar samples, his phrase “lead humanity” would appear to include the transport of humans beyond Mars.\n\nIt may take some time for Trump Administration officials at the White House, or National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Administrator Jared Isaacman to articulate the full meaning of Trump’s phrase.\n\nAnother source of U.S. space leadership, the White House National Space Council, most recently led by Vice Presidents Mike Pence and then Kamala Harris, will not be continued under the leadership of Vice President J.D. Vance.\n\nBut Trump’s full statement amounts to an American commitment to achieve a significant manned presence on Mars, and then perhaps considering some of the more promising Moons of Jupiter and/or Saturn for manned visitation, which by logic would require a manned presence on Earth’s Moon for security goals and to develop the technology required for deeper space exploration.\n\nTrump previously explained the necessity for going to the Moon in a Sept. 20, 2019 meeting at the White House with Australian Prime Minister Morrison, saying, “They said, ‘No, sir. It’s a launching pad for Mars.’ So, we’ll be doing the Moon. But we’ll really be doing Mars. And we’ll be — we’re making tremendous progress.”\n\nTrump’s new focus on Mars can in part be attributed to his developed friendship with Elon Musk, leader of the innovative SpaceX Corporation, developer of the million+ ton reusable Starship, that since about 2016 Musk has touted as the vehicle that SpaceX will use populate Mars with humans.\n\nWhile it has been tested eight times, with mixed success as per the SpaceX “fail forward” philosophy of iterative development, Starship would have to demonstrate full two stage reusability, full Earth orbit mission capabilities, refueling in Low Earth Orbit, in addition to missions to and from the Moon before undertaking missions to Mars.\n\nFull Report . . . .

Vance touted Michigan’s industrial prospects during a Friday, March 14, visit to a Bay County plastics manufacturer.\n\nVance arrived about noon for a tour of Vantage Plastics in Bay County’s Bangor Township, near Bay City, where he delivered the 25-minute pitch for President Donald Trump’s economic plans.\n\n“On January 20th, we started a great American comeback,“ the vice president told a crowd of about 300 company employees and political figures inside the facility.\n\n“Last November, America reelected a president with a simple goal: to power our nation’s industrial comeback and‚ once again, make the U.S. the world’s manufacturing superpower. And that is exactly what President Trump has sought out to do.”\n\nVance’s 2-hour stop in Michigan happened as Trump’s administration continued to engage in trade wars with Canada and Mexico, sparking debate and angst over how the tariffs deployed by the president could impact American commerce. A plunging stock market lately has added to those anxieties.\n\nVance, though, cautioned the Bay County crowd of “a long road ahead” as the administration replaces policies adapted by its Democratic predecessor in the White House.\n\n“We’re not going to be able to fix everything that Joe Biden broke, but I think, after seven weeks, the progress is pretty good,” Vance said.\n\nHe claimed Trump policies were lowering gas and egg prices while reversing America’s budget deficit. \n\nHe claimed, without providing details, that “dead people” received loans from the Small Business Administration agency before Trump. \n\nVance praised this week’s announcement that Trump launched U.S. Environmental Protection Agency pollution and climate regulation rollbacks, which the vice president said would provide companies with “relief from heavy-handed rules.”\n\nVance also defended a series of tariffs Trump in recent weeks launched, withdrew, re-launched and continues to adjust against Canada and Mexico.\n\n“You hear people say, ‘Well, how dare Donald Trump impose tariffs on foreign countries that have been taking advantage of us for four years?,’” Vance said. “And the answer is that, unless you’re willing to use American power to fight back against what those countries have been doing for a generation, you are never going to rebuild American manufacturing.”\n\nVance seemed to reference Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who met with Trump at the White House one day earlier. The Democratic governor had called the gathering a “productive meeting.”\n\nWhile Vance didn’t name Whitmer during his Friday address, he seemed to reference her meeting with Trump.\n\n“It’s kind of funny to see some of our Democratic governors — I don’t want to mention which states exactly — coming to the Oval Office and begging for economic development under Trump’s leadership that they knew they would never get under Biden’s leadership,” Vance said.\n\nThe vice president said members of the Trump administration “don’t care if it’s Democrat, Republican or independent: We want to build, baby, build.”\n\nFrom inside the facility, Vance took a verbal shot at protesters gathered near the street outside the building.\n\n“It’s a little after noon on a Friday: Don’t you all have jobs?,” he said, sparking a round of laughter from the indoor crowd. “We want those people to get off the streets and back to work.”\n\nVance hailed the work of Vantage Plastics, a custom thermoformer with in-house design, prototyping, and tool build capabilities that serve customers in the automotive and consumer goods industries.\n\nThe company employs about 300 people in Michigan.\n\n“I really do believe that America’s success depends on the success of companies like Vantage Plastics,” Vance said. “And I don’t mean that in some abstract, poetic-sounding sense; I mean literally. If we do not protect our nation’s manufacturers, we lose a fundamental part of who we are as a people. Making things, building things, working with our hands is America’s heritage.”\n\nVance was accompanied Friday by Kelly Loeffler, the administrator for the U.S. Small Business Administration, who also advocated for Trump’s trade and business policies to the Bangor Township crowd on Friday.\n\nLoeffler claimed Trump “already delivered 10,000 manufacturing jobs right here in America; he secured over $2 trillion in investment to build manufacturing” industries.\n\n“The golden era of manufacturing in America is not behind us,” Loeffler told the crowd. “It’s in front of us.”\n\nAlso traveling with Vance was his wife, Usha Vance. \n\nThe entourage arrived at MBS International Airport via Air Force Two at about 11 a.m. \n\nFrom the Saginaw County airport, they traveled about 17 miles northeast to the Bangor Township facility.\n\nAlong the way, the motorcade moved along busy Saginaw and Bay county roads. Some residents stood outside their porches, waving at the passing vehicle. A class of school-age children stood in a parking lot and waved too.\n\nNearer to the facility, the motorcade was flanked by an organized protest, where participants waved signs aimed at Vance and shouted obscenities at the passing vehicles. They carried signs with messages including “Tariffs hurt USA” and “No Fascists.”\n\nAbout 300 people met Vance inside Vantage Plastics. There, the Trump campaign anthem, “YMCA,” played as the crowd awaited the vice president.\n\nAmong those in the crowd were Michigan-based Republican U.S. Reps. Tom Barrett and John James. Former Michigan GOP gubernatorial candidate Tudor Dixon also attended the gathering.\n\nAfter receiving a tour of the manufacturing plant, Vance stepped onto a makeshift stage shortly after noon. The crowd inside cheered as “Forty Hour Week (For A Livin’)” by Alabama played during his introduction.\n\nThey cheered again as he exited the facility and his motorcade began its return to MBS International Airport. \n\nAir Force Two’s wheels lifted from the tarmac about 1 p.m., or about two hours after the vice president arrived.\n\nVance’s visit represented the Trump administration’s first stop in Michigan since Trump regained control of the White House.\n\nVance’s encounter with protesters in Bay County was no new experience for the vice president.\n\nThe night before his mid-Michigan visit, Vance was booed by the crowd during a concert at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington.\n\nIn a social media post, Vance said last weekend he and his family confronted protesters at his East Walnut Hills home in Ohio. Earlier this month, the vice president was met by protestors during a ski trip in Vermont.\n\nStill, Vance’s Friday visit placed him in pro-Trump territory. Bay County favored the Republican ticket in the 2024 presidential election. In November 2024, 34,792 Bay County residents voted for Trump and his vice president while 25,767 voted for Democrat Kamala Harris, the previous vice president.","summary":"Vance arrived for a tour of Vantage Plastics in Bay County, where he delivered a 25-minute pitch for President Donald Trump’s economic plans.","url":"https://www.mlive.com/politics/2025/03/jd-vance-champions-american-comeback-during-michigan-factory-tour.html","image":"https://www.mlive.com/resizer/v2/IV6VVUFMS5B4FCIC3MGYAYDALM.JPG?auth=16eb0aeb68a2968556c984b3f7c6012f10f871bd32d2a21da5b86321e2162503&width=1280&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-14 18:15:56","author":"Justin Engel","authors":["Justin Engel"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.073},{"id":300240582,"title":"Vance hints Biden’s wife ran the US","text":"US Vice President J.D.

Its real purpose is to exercise raw partisan power.\n\nThe FCC already knows CBS did not violate any rules and merely engaged in everyday journalism. And there is nothing to be learned from the over 8,000 comments and counting that have poured into the commission's inbox. Many simply registered their like or dislike of the network and mainstream media in general, and many others were just unserious quips submitted to troll the regulators.\n\nBut judging the merits of the \"news distortion\" allegation was never the point. The FCC staff already dismissed the complaint—filed by a partisan activist group—as fatally defective back in January. As outgoing FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel explained, \"The FCC should not be the President's speech police….The FCC should not be journalism's censor-in-chief.\" But one of Brendan Carr's first acts as the new FCC chair in Donald Trump's administration was to reinstate the complaint and call for public comments.\n\nAsking members of the public to \"vote\" on how they feel about a news organization's editorial policies or whether they think the network violated FCC rules is both pointless and constitutionally infirm. In 1943, Justice Robert Jackson wrote that the right to free speech and a free press \"may not be submitted to vote; they depend on the outcome of no elections.\"\n\nThe FCC's reanimated proceeding lacks any legitimate regulatory rationale. But its realpolitik purpose is sadly transparent. This fishing expedition is designed to exert maximum political leverage on the CBS network at a time when Trump is engaged in preposterous litigation over the same 60 Minutes broadcast, claiming CBS' editing violates a Texas law against fraudulent commercial transactions. Adding to the pressure, Chairman Carr said he will consider the thousands of comments in this proceeding when evaluating whether to approve a merger of Skydance Media and CBS parent company Paramount Global worth billions of dollars.\n\nThere is nothing here for the FCC to investigate. The complaint alleges that Harris gave a \"word salad\" response to a question about whether Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was listening to the Biden administration and that CBS edited it to make her sound more articulate. One part of her responses was aired on 60 Minutes and another part aired on Face the Nation.\n\nIn short, CBS stands accused of committing journalism. Every day, from the smallest newspaper to the largest network, reporters and editors must make sense of and condense the information they collect—including quotes from politicians and other newsmakers—to tell their stories concisely and understandably. That task necessarily requires editing, including selecting what quotes to use. If the cockamamie theory underlying this FCC \"investigation\" had any merit, every newsroom in America would be a crime scene.\n\nThat's why the FCC in the past has never defined the editing process as \"news distortion.\" In fact, the commission made quite clear when it first articulated the news distortion policy in 1969 that \"we do not mean the type of situation, frequently encountered, where a person quoted on a news program complains that he very clearly said something else.\" It stressed, \"We do not sit to review the broadcaster's news judgment, the quality of his news and public affairs reporting, or his taste.\"\n\nThe commission understood that this very narrow approach is required to respect both the First Amendment and the Communications Act, which denies the FCC \"the power of censorship.\" As the FCC observed, \"In this democracy, no Government agency can authenticate the news, or should try to do so.\"\n\nThere is a name for what the FCC is doing in this proceeding: a show trial. When investigations become a performative exercise designed to further a political purpose, they forfeit any claim to legitimacy. Show trials are intended to send a message, not just to their unfortunate victims, but to other would-be transgressors.\n\nThere is a dark and deadly history of such proceedings in authoritarian regimes around the world, ranging from Josef Stalin's purges of perceived political opponents to China's trials of \"rioters and counterrevolutionaries\" after the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. Though less extreme in nature, during the Red Scare, the House Committee on Un-American Activities similarly staged show hearings where they pressured witnesses to name names while presuming guilt. The stakes of a sham FCC proceeding may differ, but the tactics and perversion of the rule of law are the same. \n\nSomewhere along the way, the FCC's current leadership abandoned that basic truth in exchange for political expediency. And in doing so, it is ignoring a unanimous holding from the Supreme Court just last term that threatening legal sanctions and other means of coercion to suppress disfavored speech violates the First Amendment. \n\nThe commission can begin to recover some dignity only by dropping this show trial immediately.","summary":"The commission’s partisan “news distortion” probe is trampling the First Amendment to pressure the press.","url":"https://reason.com/2025/03/14/the-fccs-show-trial-against-cbs-is-a-political-power-play/","image":"https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/03/sipaphotossixteen488619-scaled.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-14 15:40:50","author":"Matthew Petti,Robert Corn-Revere","authors":["Matthew Petti","Robert Corn-Revere"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.346},{"id":300276798,"title":"Mark Carney Knows Trade, Must Master Politics","text":"After a swift and improbable ascent, Mark Carney, the former Bank of Canada governor, took office as the country’s 24th prime minister on Friday morning. A crisis-less Carney, with his Bank of England, Bank of Canada, Goldman Sachs, Harvard, and Oxford credentials, likely would have had a more grueling race to the top if not for the U.S. trade war provocations, and been dismissed as a wealthy cosmopolitan banker type, far removed from the struggles of ordinary people. But he has emerged as a champion for many anxious Canadians consigned to a once-unfathomable dystopia: being held hostage to an American president bent on wrecking the North American economy.\n\nAmid a rare surge of national pride, even voters who might be otherwise leery of his globalist gloss admit that Carney has serious “skillz,” as the kids say, to match the Trump team brain cell for brain cell in the trade war, which is preferable to the alternative of a career politician with no special expertise in Canada’s domestic or international economic policymaking.\n\nRecent polling suggests that the once-hapless Liberals are within striking distance of a Conservative Party that once expected to waltz into power. Outgoing leader Justin Trudeau created the conditions for Carney’s accession. As Trudeau neared his ten-year milestone, the usual shelf life of a Canadian prime minister, he embarked on a journey of self-defenestration. When his perfunctory talks with President Donald Trump proved fruitless, he returned to Ottawa to talk his finance minister out of her job. Instead, she invited him to take the job and shove it, precipitating his downfall faster than a pronghorn across the Saskatchewan prairie.\n\nWhat does it mean for Canada to have Carney meeting this moment? Much more, if it turns out that this political neophyte recalls another candidate who thrilled millions initially, only to falter in the transition from the shadows of policymaking into the unforgiving world of retail campaigning.\n\nThere was an outpouring of joy and jubilation over the journey of the accomplished and telegenic Kamala Harris to the top of the Democratic ticket. Polls showing narrowing margins in July and August left Democrats with the illusion that their candidate would step up to the podium on the West Front of the U.S. Capitol, an illusion that persisted until screens displayed a bright-red map of the United States on election night.\n\nCarney’s dilemma is more clearly defined. He arrives on the political scene with a clear meltdown in progress, and Canada’s sovereignty turned into a punch line by a hostile president. But like Harris, his predecessor’s baggage dogs him, and the entirety of his retail political experience spans the time it’s taken for the Trump administration to manufacture the North American trade war.\n\nCarney will have to fend off the “Maple MAGA” elements of the Canadian political universe that are flocking to the Conservative Party’s Pierre Poilievre.\n\nCrisis-tested though he may be after helping lead Canada through the Great Recession and warning about the folly of Brexit in Great Britain, he comes into the limelight without political experience, raising questions about whether the onetime Harvard backup hockey goalie can turn “Elbows Up” into political hard currency.\n\nTim Walz’s recent critique of 2024 electoral tactics confirmed that Harris’s team played it safe, shying away from criticism of President Biden, failing to validate voter angst on inflation, housing, and other quotidian woes. Appeals about democracy and warnings about Project 2025 didn’t resonate with an electorate that reasoned life under Trump wouldn’t be “that bad,” nor did they persuade couch-sitters to get off their collective duffs. Walz, whom The Washington Post described as “a surprisingly bubble-wrapped campaigner,” lamented that he and Harris should have more forcefully countered the conservative bro-verse, and gotten off the swing-state treadmill and met voters where they lived by doing more town halls.\n\n“The people who I think will pretty clearly stick with [Carney] are people who are on the sort of business/liberal side of the party. [They] find him very reassuring,” says Richard Johnston, a professor of political science emeritus of the University of British Columbia. Carney has gravitas, but the challenge is showing Canadians beset by housing crises, health care system strains, and high prices that he understands their daily lives. After a patron blurted out “Churchill” to Carney during a recent visit to an Ontario pub, he opined that it was “1938.” He’ll have to offer more than neo-Churchillian rhetoric about being on a wartime footing to convince most voters.\n\n“That’s part of his vulnerability to demonstrate that he actually gets it about ordinary people and in contexts not involving trade war with Donald Trump,” says Johnston. “The question now is whether those things, which a year ago might have been vulnerabilities, are actually assets. We don’t yet know what he’s like on the sidewalk.”\n\nHe will also have to fend off the “Maple MAGA” elements of the Canadian political universe that are flocking to the Conservative Party’s Pierre Poilievre. Though his parliamentary record is less than stellar, after 20 years in Parliament, Poilievre is an experienced campaigner.\n\nCanada has two distinct electorates: the Francophone province of Quebec and the rest of the country. There is what Johnston calls the “ethnonational dimension” that runs through the Carney-Poilievre election contest in Quebec. Even though Francophones are a minority nationwide in Canada, they are the majority in Quebec and their relations with various immigrant groups and native English speakers are “fraught,” a dynamic that could pose problems for Carney. “There are some awkward questions that are almost certain to come up in a debate, and he could find himself falling into a trap in Quebec,” Johnston says, “and once that starts to happen, then things might start to unravel in the rest of the country.” Poilievre is fluent in French. But Carney’s French is not as polished: He has already had one embarrassing mistake during a Liberal leadership debate.\n\nBut though the province is often at odds with English Canada, Quebec has resolutely lined up with the rest of the country on the tariff war and the mission of finding a strategy to deal with the American president, which has elicited a combination of amazement and relief.\n\nJust how conservative is Poilievre? Maple MAGA, as far-right conservatives are known in Canada, is similar to its U.S. counterpart: Its fans are mostly rural and disgruntled working-class (though not union member) Canadians. “You don’t actually have to go very far to find people who are perfectly comfortable saying the sort of things that MAGA says in the U.S., and believing many of the same facts or factoids in relation to Canada as well as to the U.S.,” says Johnston. Poilievre “is an appealing figure for the more MAGA side of Canada [but] even there he’s an equivocal figure, he’s not MAGA enough.”\n\nCanadian elections are won in the major metro areas of Toronto, Vancouver, and Montreal. People of color, who tend to be concentrated in the suburban and exurban areas, are critical to the Liberals’ calculus. South Asians are the largest ethnic group, followed by the Chinese and Black Canadians. The First Nations, who are more politically powerful than indigenous groups in the U.S., have issues with both parties. Many, but not all, voters of color have lower voting rates than whites.\n\nAnother test for Carney is securing a seat in Parliament. He must find a “safe” Liberal seat where he can be easily elected. For example, Johnston suggests that a downtown Toronto or Vancouver riding (district) with a high percentage of university graduates could be doable. A riding in Ottawa, where he lives, or Edmonton, where he grew up, might also be on the table. But Alberta, as a whole, is a Conservative stronghold with a premier, Danielle Smith, who has ties to the American right.\n\nTo form a majority government, Liberals would need to capture 170 of 338 seats in the House of Commons. A Liberal or Conservative minority government would need the support of smaller opposition parties like the left-of-center New Democratic Party or the Bloc Québécois, which advocates for Quebec’s independence. The downside is that minority governments usually last two years or less.\n\nA Conservative government would face special pressures. “Cozying up to Trump would be a big mistake,” says Johnston.\n\nThe Liberals appear to be keen to call an election as early as possible, perhaps before Parliament reconvenes on March 24. The vote would then be held at the end of April or in early May.\n\nYet Kamala Harris’s warnings weren’t heeded by Americans, and both countries are living with the psychic and economic whiplash of that seminal miscalculation. Will Pierre Poilievre’s “Canada First” rhetoric, with its MAGA-adjacent “America First” tones, stoke fears of “cozying up” and precipitate a strong enough backlash to disable the Conservatives? Can Mark Carney convince Canadians that he is the one to keep their country on an even keel as it tries to discern exactly what it is that the United States really wants? An American-instigated trade war is more fraught than the Great Recession or Brexit.\n\n“Maybe Trump has changed the agenda for trade policy forever. It was changing anyway—the Biden administration was pretty protectionist,” says Johnston. “It’s really a decade-long pivot by the U.S. away from the liberal international order that it created; we’re going to have to think about what a new order is and how we fit into it.”","summary":"The new Canadian prime minister, a former international banker, can handle a crisis, but he’ll have to cope with the ups and downs of retail politics on the campaign trail.","url":"https://prospect.org/world/2025-03-14-mark-carney-knows-trade-must-master-politics/","image":"https://prospect.org/downloads/22605/download/Gurley-Canada%20031425.jpg?cb=e15cdef6177c400f2c407d9dad2eaf16&w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-14 15:30:00","author":"Gabrielle Gurley","authors":["Gabrielle Gurley"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.359},{"id":300231994,"title":"Why is an Elon Musk-backed PAC running an ad against Republican state legislators? (World)","text":"A group backed by Elon Musk is running ads targeting conservative Republican legislators in several states over their support of a federal drug pricing program. No one seems as surprised about the effort as the lawmakers themselves.\n\nThe video ad by Building America’s Future is titled “Trump Underminers.” It focuses on the federal 340B program, saying it “is now a disaster” and to “let Trump fix 340B.”\n\nThe ad groups together five lawmakers in Kentucky, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota and Tennessee whom it accuses of trying to mandate expansion of the program. It is one of the first signs since Trump returned to the White House of a group linked to Musk going after Republicans in individual states.\n\nThe legislators say they want to help rural hospitals and don’t understand what is behind the criticism or why the group, of which Musk is a major donor, is singling them out.\n\nHere's a look at the ad's claims and the mystery behind them:\n\nWhat is the 340B program?\n\nUnder the program, drug manufacturers are required to provide discounts to hospitals caring for uninsured and low-income patients, according to the American Hospital Association. The program was expanded to rural hospitals in 2010.\n\nThe ad airing on local television says, “Some Republicans in your state are undermining Trump and trying to mandate expansion of 340B.”\n\nThe message goes on to say the program “helps fund gender transitions for kids, abortion procedures and health care for illegals.”\n\nNebraska state Sen. Brian Hardin, who is named in the ad, said there is no truth to those claims.\n\nThe program has been at a center of a yearslong lobbying battle between hospitals and pharmaceutical companies, with each side attempting to enlist lawmakers in maintaining or reforming the benefit.\n\nWhat do the lawmakers think?\n\nThe claims in the ad lead Hardin to wonder whether pharmaceutical companies might be behind the effort.\n\n“It only fuels my speculation that somebody brought a modicum of actual information to Musk and said, ‘Please throw your money behind us,’” Hardin said.\n\nNorth Dakota Republican Rep. Jon Nelson said the only truthful statement in the ad is the spelling of his name. Nelson said he introduced a bill this session with a goal of continuing the 340B program as it exists.\n\nNelson said the pharmaceutical industry wants to get rid of the program because “long story short, they don’t want to sell their drugs at a discount.”\n\nIt's all puzzling, Nelson said, because he doesn't know of any organized effort to end the program.\n\n“There’s absolutely no undermining that’s taking place here because there’s been no action from Washington to change 340B that I’m aware of,” Nelson said. “We’re not undermining anything that’s taking place in Washington.”\n\nKentucky Republican state Sen. Stephen Meredith said his legislation is not about the 340B program.\n\n“My bill is about the fact Kentucky healthcare providers who serve a disproportionate number of economically disadvantaged people; predominately in rural communities, are being discriminated against by pharmaceutical manufacturers who are arbitrarily and capriciously withholding 340B drugs and 340B discounts which are legally due to these qualifying healthcare providers,” Meredith said in a statement.\n\nLike the others, Hardin said he is being targeted for his bill that would preserve Nebraska hospitals’ access to the program.\n\nHardin said the ad has been running in Nebraska for about three weeks, but has done nothing to hurt his bill. It advanced last week from the first of three rounds of debate 41-0.\n\nWhy is this group doing this?\n\nThat's unclear. Building America's Future didn't respond to an email seeking information about their effort. A spokesperson for another Musk-funded political group acknowledged a phone message but did not respond to questions. Building America’s Future's X profile could not be messaged.\n\nA spokesperson for the PhRMA pharmaceutical trade group said the organization has neither given nor plans to give funds to Building America's Future.\n\n“Our position on this issue has been clear: Big, tax-exempt hospitals and clinics are using 340B medicine markups to boost their profits at the expense of patients, employers and taxpayers,” said Sarah Ryan, senior manager of public affairs for PhRMA.\n\nThe ad has aired in broadcast markets in Nashville, North Dakota, South Dakota and Nebraska, according to media tracking firm AdImpact.\n\nBuilding America's Future is also behind misleading ads and text messages to voters in a consequential upcoming Wisconsin Supreme Court election. The group also was the single funder of a political group that pushed opposing ads last year in Michigan and Pennsylvania on then-Vice President Kamala Harris' position on Israel.\n\nBuilding America's Future posted a photo to X in February of a large truck outside the North Dakota Capitol in Bismarck, bearing the messages \"Tell North Dakota Republicans: Stop subsidized gender transitions for kids,\" and “340B is subsidizing gender transitions for kids.”\n\nIn 2023, then-Gov.

The Secretary of State’s Office does not track historic turnout for special elections.\n\n“The results of special elections all around the country show how deeply unpopular Trump is, and how motivated Democratic and Independent voters are to vote against Republicans,” said DFL House Leader Melissa Hortman.\n\nDFL candidate David Gottfried received more than 70% of the vote for the Roseville-area seat, nearly 10 percentage points higher than the DFL candidate received in the district last November. He also outperformed former Vice President Kamala Harris' margin in the district.\n\nGottfried, a pro bono specialist for a local law firm, said he and his campaign staff knocked on thousands of doors and called almost as many voters throughout the east-metro suburban district and the response was fairly uniform: People want the chaos to end, and they want lawmakers to work in bipartisan fashion.\n\n“A lot of folks are very upset over how the federal government is conducting itself,” he said. \n\nThe seat also held plenty of significance in Minnesota. The winner of the House District 40B seat in November was DFLer Curtis Johnson.

According to FIGHT: Inside the Wildest Battle for the White House by Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes, Biden repeatedly warned Harris to avoid “daylight” between their positions, mirroring his 2008 strategy to tie John McCain to George W. Bush. This directive hampered Harris’s campaign efforts, as Biden’s advisors closely monitored her messaging, even sidelining her trusted aide Sean Clegg during debate prep for urging her to focus less on past achievements.Post-election, the failed Harris-Tim Walz campaign faced internal finger-pointing, with many blaming Biden’s low approval ratings for dragging down Harris’s bid. Tensions flared as Biden-aligned staffers restricted Harris’s team from publicly critiquing his legacy, creating friction over strategy. Clegg’s advice to avoid revisiting Biden’s record reportedly led to his exclusion from key meetings by longtime Democratic strategist Stephanie Cutter, deepening rifts between Harris loyalists and Biden’s inner circle. Critics argue this lack of autonomy stifled Harris’s ability to redefine her platform, cementing Biden’s policies as an electoral liability.FAQs:Why couldn’t Kamala Harris criticize Biden’s policies during the 2024 campaign?Biden enforced a strict loyalty mandate, instructing Harris to avoid creating “daylight” between their positions.

Balboa Cafe Partners and PlumpJack Management Group are the Newsom-owned organizations, donated combined $10,000 to the $97,000 bust fund, the book reports.\n\nBut the governor’s office disputed the claim. \n\n ‘To imply the Governor personally funded or proposed this effort is categorically false,’ Brandon Richards, Newsom’s Deputy Director for Rapid Response told DailyMail.com. \n\nThe sculpture currently sits near other two-term mayors such as Willie Brown, Dianne Feinstein, and George Moscone. \n\nRichards conceded that businesses tied to the Newsom family contributed a ‘modest contribution’ to the privately funded effort, but said it was not ‘secret,’ as reports claimed. \n\nThe governor’s office said the governor’s wife, Jennifer Siebel Newsom helped raise the money for the bronze bust of the former mayor, which was reported in the San Francisco Chronicle in 2018. \n\nBut that report did not reveal the specific donations for the monument made by his family businesses. \n\nOne of the book’s co-authors, Susan Crabtree, responded to Newsom’s claims in a statement to DailyMail.com.\n\n‘Team Newsom is afraid of the shocking revelations in FOOL’S GOLD—which is backed by more than forty-five pages of endnotes containing more than 1,000 open-source reputable and verifiable citations with zero anonymous sources—and that is why they are trying to smear this book,’ Crabtree replied. \n\nThe book threatens to disrupted Newsom’s careful effort to rehab his image as he eyes a run for president in 2028 after his time as a surrogate for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. \n\nThe California governor recently launched a podcast, where he is hosting interviews with conservative activists like Charlie Kirk, populist nationalist Stephen K. Bannon and conservative radio host Michael Savage. \n\nNewsom served as mayor of California’s second largest city from 2004 to 2011, elected while he was still married to Donald Trump’s current Ambassador to Greece, Kimberly Guilfoyle. \n\nThe book chronicles Newsom’s use of ‘behested payments’ to fund projects adding to his legacy. \n\n‘The simple fact is that no one knew that Gavin Newsom used a called ‘behested payments’ to solicit funds from his own companies to erect a monument to himself inside San Francisco City Hall until we followed the money and unearthed the obscure documents,’ Crabtree stated. ‘Furthermore, Newsom’s team has thus far whether his companies got a tax break for funding this ‘charitable’ statue; just like Newsom’s and his statute is a scandal, and we stand by our reporting.’\n\nWhen the bust was being constructed, Newsom admitted that he found the whole thing odd but chose to play naïve about who paid for it. \n\n‘I don’t want to call it embarrassing, but it’s a strange thing,’ he told SFGATE at the time. ‘I’m just awkward about it. But now the word is out.’ \n\nAt the time, the newspaper reported that ‘Newsom supporters’ had paid for the bust with ‘private funds.’\n\nNewsom has faced scrutiny for the move, with one calling him ‘ridiculous.’ \n\n‘Now I know what a narcissist is,’ wrote another.\n\n‘This is peak leftist arrogance—worshiping their own failures while everyday Californians suffer under their disastrous policies,’ added another. \n\n‘If only he cared half as much about fixing his state as he does about immortalizing his own ego.’ \n\nNewsom has been facing criticism over his his podcast and his handling of the devastating Los Angeles wildfires.\n\nWhile the Golden State is in the midst of recovering from the horrific wildfire disaster, which left at least 29 people dead and more than 18,000 structures destroyed, the Democratic governor was accused of having his focus on other issues, as he launched his new podcast venture.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom denied a bombshell claim that he secretly personally&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Gavin Newsom responds to claims about funding a statue of himself first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/politics/gavin-newsom-responds-to-claims-about-funding-a-statue-of-himself/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/14/12/96169267-14496935-image-a-29_1741955527617.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-14 14:27:27","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.095},{"id":300198772,"title":"Trump will visit the Justice Department, months after his criminal prosecutions were dismissed","text":"By ERIC TUCKER and ALANNA DURKIN RICHER, Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is set to visit the Justice Department on Friday to rally support for his administration’s tough-on-crime agenda, an appearance expected to double as a victory lap after he emerged legally and politically unscathed from two federal prosecutions that were dismissed after his election win last fall.\n\n“I’m going to set out my vision,” the Republican president said Thursday about the purpose for a visit the White House is billing as “historic.”\n\nThe venue selection for the speech underscores Trump’s keen interest in the department and desire to exert influence over it following criminal investigations that shadowed his first four years in office and subsequent campaign.

Bianco received 11% of the vote.Gibson has been a vocal critic of California's Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom since his $14.5-million Malibu mansion burned down in the California wildfires in January.On an episode of the Joe Rogan podcast the same month, he accused Newsom of failing to \"take care of the forest,\" while jokingly suggesting that the governor was spending all of California's tax dollars on his \"hair gel.\"He has since joined a recall effort against Newsom, organised by Saving California. At a press conference about the recall petition in February he claimed Newsom doesn't \"give a damn\" about the state.\"There are many who say it is criminal negligence. Do the mayor and the governor give a damn about you? Hell no!\" the actor said.But while Gibson has been one of the most vocal opponents of Newsom, he reportedly has no plans to throw his hat into the ring to replace the outgoing California governor. Gibson's publicist, Alan Nierob, told the California Globe on Thursday that the actor is not running for California governor. \"He's sticking with his day job for now,\" Nierob said.Gubernatorial pollster Guillermo Williams told the California Globe that Gibson's position in the recall campaign against Newsom has given him \"a lot of goodwill\" and that Gibson could have given the Republicans their best showing in California since 2006 if he had chosen to run. The 2006 gubernatorial election in California saw actor and Republican candidate Arnold Schwarzenegger elected with 55% of the vote.\"For Gibson right now, he seems to be in a good spot. He has the special ambassador title right now, and he is very much a leading voice on the Newsom recall. That is getting him a lot of goodwill. He's also speaking up for victims of the wildfires that way too. So not running for Governor makes sense since this is working for him right now. He's winning a lot of people back by doing this too,\" Williams said.\"Republicans are in the best spot they have been in for years at gaining back ground. The GOP did very well in California in the 2024 elections, and they want to build further next year. At the very least, they want to the race to have the best showing for the party since 2006. Gibson could have gotten there, but he also does have significant baggage with him. We'll see who else runs,\" he added.But while Williams thinks Gibson could have been a strong candidate for California governor, he said that many Californians have grown weary of celebrity politicians, like Ronald Reagan and Arnold Schwarzenegger.\"It would have been really something for him to run, especially in this race,\" Williams said. \"But a lot of Californians have tired of celebrities running for office in recent years. Reagan was a union head, Schwarzenegger had a few Presidential appointments, and Gibson was named a special ambassador. So it's not like they don't have anything. But a lot of Californians also want anyone besides Porter or Harris.\"Former Democratic Representative Katie Porter, who left the House for an unsuccessful Senate run last year, announced she is running for California governor this week. \"What California needs now is a little bit of hope and a whole lot of grit, fresh blood and new ideas, leaders with the backbone to fight for what's right,\" Porter said in her announcement video. \"That's why I am running for governor.\"Porter enters a field that is stacked with contenders, including former Democratic mayor of Los Angeles Antonio Villaraigosa, former speaker of the California State Assembly Toni Atkins, the state's current lieutenant governor Eleni Kounalakis, as well as California State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond and former state controller Betty Yee.But none have emerged as a clear front-runner yet. However, that could change if former Vice President Kamala Harris enters the race. Harris is reportedly considering a run, and has given herself a deadline to decide.\"If Vice President Harris were to choose to run, I am certain that that would have a near field-clearing effect on the Democratic side,\" Porter told The Orange County Register late last year.\"I would support her if she ran, I've always supported her in everything she's done. She would be field-clearing,\" Democratic California Attorney General Rob Bonta told Politico after saying he would not run for governor.But The Lost Coast poll shows that Harris is not necessarily the front runner in the race, with Porter beating her with 25% of the vote to the former vice president's 20%. But Williams told The Globe the poll should be taken with \"a pinch of salt.\"\"The Lost Coast poll was just a straw poll with, like you said, mainly North Coast voters. There was no demographic data and was literally just a single question. If this was a SoCal poll, then we would likely see some of those LA candidates get some higher percentages. Take it with a pinch of salt,\" he said.Other polls have shown Harris leading other Democrats by a wide margin if she were to enter the race.According to Emerson College Polling/Inside California Politics/The Hill, conducted between February 10-11 among 1,000 California registered voters, nearly 6 in 10 Democratic primary voters in California, 57% would vote for Harris as governor.Porter received 9% support, while former California State Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa and current Lieutenant Governor Eleni Kounalakis each garnered 4%. Seventeen percent of voters remained undecided.Without Harris in the race, Porter's support rose to 21%, followed by Villaraigosa at 9% and Kounalakis at 5%. A significant 45% of Democratic primary voters were undecided. The poll had a margin of error of +/- 3 points.Another poll from UC Berkeley and the Los Angeles Times, conducted in October, showed Harris with a substantial advantage over other candidates for the 2026 California gubernatorial race.What People Are SayingGubernatorial pollster Guillermo Williams told the California Globe: \"The Lost Coast poll was just a straw poll with, like you said, mainly North Coast voters. There was no demographic data and was literally just a single question. If this was a SoCal poll, then we would likely see some of those LA candidates get some higher percentages. Take it with a pinch of salt. That being said, the poll did show that it was still in line with where Californians stood with candidates from previous polls, so there is value here. Plus, the North Coast can be a microcosm of California in some ways, so it at least shows who is popular in the race.\"Porter and Harris were not surprises, although Porter coming before Harris was. Gibson had yet to be on a poll, and it showed him doing quite well. A lot of these candidates are only known in their circles around LA or San Diego or Sacramento, and look how well they did. Gibson, LA guy, is a known entity and he has the lead. Bianco too was a surprise, although he is the only big-name Republican in the race right now.\"Overall, while being skewed to the North Coast, the poll does show that Harris and Porter are the Democratic favorites, with the GOP is still working on it. Bianco has support, but so does Gibson. Right now, we live in a world where we could see a Kamala Harris-Mel Gibson race for Governor next year. But neither of them have said one way or another yet too. Wow.\"What Happens NextCalifornia will elect its next governor in 2026 when Newsom's term ends. Newsom is believed to be a contender for the 2028 Democratic nomination for president. However, he has not yet expressed any desire to run.In November, Newsom had +550 odds of becoming the next president, according to SportsBettingDime, which amounts to a 15 percent chance. Harris had +2500 odds, or a 4 percent chance.","summary":"Gibson has emerged as a leading figure in a recall effort against California Governor Gavin Newsom.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/mel-gibson-california-governor-poll-gavin-newsom-2044755","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2607253/mel-gibson.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-14 13:47:25","author":"Martha McHardy","authors":["Martha McHardy"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.296},{"id":300175622,"title":"Trump will visit the Justice Department, months after his criminal prosecutions were dismissed","text":"President Donald Trump is set to visit the Justice Department on Friday to rally support for his administration's tough-on-crime agenda, an appearance expected to double as a victory lap after he emerged legally and politically unscathed from two federal prosecutions that were dismissed after his election win last fall.\n\n\"I'm going to set out my vision,\" the Republican president said Thursday about the purpose for a visit the White House is billing as \"historic.\"\n\nThe venue selection for the speech underscores Trump's keen interest in the department and desire to exert influence over it following criminal investigations that shadowed his first four years in office and subsequent campaign. The visit, the first by Trump and the first by any president in a decade, brings him into the belly of an institution he has disparaged in searing terms for years but one that he has sought to reshape by installing loyalists and members of his personal defense team in top leadership positions.\n\nAlthough there's some precedent for presidents to speak to the Justice Department workforce from the building's ceremonial Great Hall, Trump's trip two months into his second term is particularly striking. That's because of his unique status as a onetime criminal defendant indicted by the agency he is now poised to address and because his remarks are likely to feature an airing of grievances over his exposure to the criminal justice system - including an FBI search in 2022 of his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, for classified documents.\n\nTrump's visit also comes at a time when Attorney General Pam Bondi has asserted that the department needs to be depoliticized even as critics assert agency leadership is injecting politics into the decision-making process.\n\n\"President Trump will visit the Department of Justice to give remarks on restoring law and order, removing violent criminals from our communities, and ending the weaponization of justice against Americans for their political leanings,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement.\n\nThe relationship between presidents and Justice Department leaders has waxed and waned over the decades depending on the personalities of the officeholders and the sensitivity of the investigations that have dominated the day. The dynamic between President Joe Biden, a Democrat, and his attorney general, Merrick Garland, was known to be fraught in part because of special counsel investigations that Garland oversaw into Biden's mishandling of classified information and into the firearms and tax affairs of his son Hunter.\n\nWhen it comes to setting its agenda, the Justice Department historically takes a cue from the White House but looks to maintain its independence on individual criminal investigations.\n\nTrump has upended such norms.\n\nHe encouraged specific investigations during his first term and tried to engineer the firing of Robert Mueller, the special counsel assigned to investigate ties between Russia and Trump's 2016 campaign. He also endured difficult relationships with his first two handpicked attorneys general - Jeff Sessions was fired immediately after the 2018 midterm election, and William Barr resigned weeks after publicly disputing Trump's bogus claims of widespread fraud in the 2020 election.\n\nArriving for a second term in January fresh off a landmark Supreme Court opinion that reaffirmed a president's unshakable control of the Justice Department, Trump has appeared determined to clear from his path any potential obstacles, including by appointing Bondi - a former Florida attorney general who was part of Trump's defense team at his first impeachment trial - and Kash Patel, another close ally, to serve as his FBI director.\n\nAt her January confirmation hearing, Bondi appeared to endorse Trump's false claims of mass voter fraud in 2020 by refusing to answer directly whether Trump had lost to Biden. She also echoed his position that he had been unfairly \"targeted\" by the Justice Department despite the wealth of evidence prosecutors say they amassed. She regularly praises him in Fox News Channel appearances and proudly noted that she had removed portraits of Biden, Garland and Vice President Kamala Harris from a Justice Department wall upon arriving.\n\n\"We all adore Donald Trump, and we want to protect him and fight for his agenda. And the people of America overwhelmingly elected him for his agenda,\" Bondi said in a recent Fox interview with Trump's daughter-in-law Lara Trump.\n\nEven before Bondi had been confirmed, the Justice Department fired department employees who served on special counsel Jack Smith's team, which charged Trump with plotting to overturn the 2020 election and with hoarding classified documents at Mar-a-Lago. Both cases were dismissed last November in line with longstanding Justice Department policy against indicting sitting presidents.\n\nOfficials also demanded from the FBI lists of thousands of employees who worked on investigations into the Jan 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol, when a mob of Trump's supporters stormed the building in an effort to halt the certification of the electoral vote, and fired prosecutors who had participated in the cases. And they've ordered the dismissal of a criminal case against New York Mayor Eric Adams by saying the charges had handicapped the Democrat's ability to partner in the Republican administration's fight against illegal immigration.\n\nLeavitt is one of three administration officials who face a lawsuit from The Associated Press on First and Fifth Amendment grounds. The AP says the three are punishing the news agency for editorial decisions they oppose. The White House says the AP is not following an executive order to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America.","summary":"President Donald Trump is set to visit the Justice Department to rally support for his administration's tough-on-crime agenda.","url":"https://abc7.com/post/trump-visit-justice-department-months-criminal-prosecutions-were-dismissed/16021613/","image":"https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/16021640_031425-cc-ap-department-of-justice-img.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-14 13:28:52","author":"Eric Tucker And Alanna Durkin Richer","authors":["Eric Tucker And Alanna Durkin Richer"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.363},{"id":300172128,"title":"Whoopi Goldberg pitches 'crowdfunding' to buy Washington Post from Bezos or 'time for a new newspaper'","text":"\"The View\" co-host Whoopi Goldberg signed off on tech reporter Kara Swisher’s dream of buying The Washington Post from Jeff Bezos or the idea that it may even be \"time for a new newspaper.\" Swisher said last year that she was working toward assembling a group of investors to purchase the Post, although the billionaire Amazon founder has given no indication he is willing to sell the Washington, D.C. paper. The Post has suffered an exodus of high-profile reporters and editors in recent months and irked some readers and staffers alike when it announced last year that it would not endorse a candidate in the 2024 presidential election. Bezos, who took credit for nixing a planned endorsement of Democratic nominee Kamala Harris, has further annoyed staffers with recent changes to the paper’s opinion page. Amidst the ongoing drama inside the Post, Swisher reiterated her desire to purchase the paper during Thursday’s episode of \"The View,\" saying she knows plenty of billionaires who would help.

The \"head of P.R.\" that Swisher referred to was presumably CCO Kathy Baird, who reportedly announced her resignation this week. The Post has not confirmed her exit. Bezos announced in February that the opinion section would be focused on writing \"in support and defense of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets.\" Earlier this week, longtime Post columnist Ruth Marcus detailed her exit from the paper in a piece for The New Yorker, calling out the paper's publisher for killing her column critical of Bezos. \"I stayed until I no longer could—until the newspaper’s owner, Jeff Bezos, issued an edict that the Post’s opinion offerings would henceforth concentrate on the twin pillars of 'personal liberties and free markets,' and, even more worrisome, that 'viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others.' I stayed until the Post’s publisher, Will Lewis, killed a column I filed last week expressing my disagreement with this new direction. Lewis refused my request to meet,\" Marcus wrote.

The Michigan State Police will escort the VP to the site, with the Bay County Sheriff’s Office taking point on security from there.\n\nBay City, Hampton Township, and Delta College police have contributed officers and vehicles to the motorcade, said Bay County Sheriff Troy R. Cunningham. Deputies and city officers will be present inside the facility as well.\n\n“All the agencies are working collaboratively to ensure a successful and safe visit,” the sheriff said.\n\nWhile protesters are expected to greet Vance on his drive to the factory, Cunningham does not anticipate they will cause problems.\n\nVance is expected to arrive at the facility in the early afternoon and visit for about 90 minutes, after which he’ll be driven back to MBS. The event is not open to the public, with only VIPs and credentialed personnel permitted.\n\nAccompanying Vance is Kelly Loeffler, the administrator for the U.S. Small Business Administration. The pair are to “deliver remarks highlighting America’s industrial resurgence,” according to a statement released by the vice president’s office.\n\nOfficials with Standish-based Vantage Plastics announced an investment of nearly $31 million to create 93 jobs in its Bangor Township facility in July 2023.\n\nVantage Plastics is a custom thermoformer with full in-house design, prototyping, and tool build capabilities serving customers in the automotive and consumer goods industries, according to the Michigan Economic Development Corp.\n\nThe company employs about 300 people in Michigan.\n\nThe visit would place Vance in Bay County, which favored the Republican ticket in the 2024 presidential election.

Vance last visited Michigan during a campaign event at the FIM Capitol Theatre in Flint on the day before Election Day.\n\nSince the new Trump administration came to power in January, Vance has toured other corners of the nation, advocating for the Republican president’s policies.\n\nLast week, Vance visited Eagle Pass, Texas, where he promoted the administration’s immigration policies.\n\nVance also has attracted protestors from citizens opposing Trump policies.\n\nIn a social media post, Vance said last weekend he and his family confronted protesters at his East Walnut Hills home in Ohio.

Tim Walz, D-Minn., is hosting town halls on Friday in Republican-held congressional districts in Iowa and Nebraska, following reports that the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) told Republicans in Congress to stop holding in-person town hall meetings. The Republicans in those districts told Fox News Digital that Walz has some questions to answer of his own. The Minnesota governor is holding a town hall in Omaha, Nebraska, on Friday morning – Republican Rep. Don Bacon’s home congressional district. The event’s digital flier said they will discuss \"Trump and Musk's cuts to critical programs from Medicaid and SNAP to our national parks.\" \"Don Bacon is not holding an in-person town hall. Nebraska Democrats are stepping up and taking action,\" the flier said. But Bacon fired back in a statement to Fox News Digital, urging Walz to answer for the inconsistencies in his record that plagued his 2024 campaign alongside former Vice President Kamala Harris. WALZ IS BACK IN MINNESOTA WITH $1M IN THE BANK AND 'WANTS THE NATIONAL SPOTLIGHT' \"First, Nebraska Democrats brought in Bernie Sanders, the most liberal Senator, to the district. Now they’re bringing in the most liberal Governor in America. Perhaps at the townhall, Gov. Walz can finally clarify what Army rank he actually retired at and when the supposed combat deployment he used to talk about occurred. If he wants to call into our townhall, he can answer these questions,\" Bacon added. AOC 'GOING ON THE OFFENSE' TO RALLY RED-DISTRICT VOTERS AGAINST TRUMP: REPORT On Friday afternoon, Walz is hosting a town hall in Des Moines, Iowa, where Rep. Zach Nunn, R-Iowa, has represented the state's 3rd Congressional District in the House of Representatives since 2023. The Iowa Democratic Party’s fundraising flier for the event alleges \"Zach Nunn has refused to host a public town hall since he was sworn into office in 2023.\" Nunn took aim at the Democrats, in response to the town hall, for calling \"a fundraiser a forum.\" \"The American people spoke loud and clear in November—they voted for change. I’m delivering to: secure the border, unleash US energy, and cut taxes for working Americans. If out-of-state Democrats want to call a fundraiser a ‘forum,’ they should join us at our listening sessions, where Iowans help drive real results. Next week, I begin my Air Force Reserve duty—I hope the Senate avoids a Schumer Shutdown, so our troops continue to get paid,\" Nunn said in a statement to Fox News Digital. Walz's office did not reply to Fox News Digital's request for comment on his upcoming town halls. The NRCC, the political campaign committee tasked with electing more Republicans to the U.S. House of Representatives, advised against town halls following a series of disruptions by Democrats' discontent with President Donald Trump’s second term. Walz announced on Wednesday if a Republican representative refused to meet with his constituents, then he would \"lend a megaphone\" to the red state constituents. \"I’m hitting the road, traveling to red states across the country to lend a megaphone to the people.

The NRCC said the protests that shut down Republicans' town hall meetings were \"manufactured productions.\" Fox News Digital reported last month about the coordinated effort by progressive groups protesting the Department of Government Efficiency. MEET THE FAR-LEFT GROUPS FUNDING ANTI-DOGE PROTESTS AT GOP OFFICES ACROSS THE COUNTRY \"The Democrat Party has sold themselves out to the far-left crazies and their mega-donors who are funding these clown show protests.

Sending out Tampon Tim won’t solve the Democrats’ ‘massive brand problem,’ despite what they may think,\" Mike Marinella, NRCC National Press Secretary, said in a statement to Fox News Digital. MoveOn.org, which has accepted millions of dollars from billionaire George Soros and his Open Society Policy Center, announced in a press release last month that it was mobilizing resources as part of a \"Congress Works for Us, Not Musk\" initiative \"aimed at pressuring lawmakers to fight back against the Trump-Musk agenda.\" \"MoveOn members and allies will show up at congressional-led town halls and congressional offices across the country, targeting House Republicans whose votes will be crucial in opposing Trump and Musk’s harmful policies,\" MoveOn.org said in the press release. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., kicked off his \"Fighting Oligarchy\" tour in Omaha last month. Sanders drew thousands of supporters to his stops in Michigan and Wisconsin this past weekend as the Vermont senator stands out as the leading progressive voice opposing Trump’s second term. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., has reportedly started planning her own rallies in Republican-held congressional districts. Walz teased his red state tour in a post last week, promising to host events in Republican-held congressional districts \"to help local Democrats beat ‘em.\" \"If your Republican representative won’t meet with you because their agenda is so unpopular, maybe a Democrat will. Hell, maybe I will. If your congressman refuses to meet, I’ll come host an event in their district to help local Democrats beat ‘em,\" Walz said in the post. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor that town hall protests should be the \"first clue\" that Republicans \"should drop their terrible agenda.\" \"Americans are organizing in public, and Republicans have seen these frustrations at town halls. That should be the first clue that they should drop their terrible agenda. When a lead Republican in the House tells Republicans, you better cancel your town halls, they're running away from their policies and priorities,\" Schumer said. NRCC Chair Rep. Richard Hudson, R-N.C., told reporters it was a \"shame that the Democrats are threats to democracy by disrupting this dialogue\" at town halls. Hudson also emphasized the expanded reach of tele-town halls, where representatives can meet with thousands of constituents at a time. DEMOCRATS ARE MAKING EARLY MOVES TO LINE UP 2028 PRESIDENTIAL BIDS Speaker of the House Mike Johnson told reporters last week that town hall protesters could be paid professionals. \"George Soros-funded groups and others literally pay protesters,\" Johnson said. \"Democratic activists who don't live in the district very often will show up for these town hall events, and they'll go in an hour early and fill all the seats, and so the constituents and the people from the community that are actually represented don't even get a seat.\" \"There are people who do this as a profession. They're professional protesters. So why would we give them a forum to do that? Right now, the best thing that our members can do is communicate directly, frequently, consistently with their constituents. There are other avenues to do it than just going in to try to give the other side soundbites. I mean, they're doing this for the cameras. We all know it,\" Johnson added. Trump also dismissed the protesters as \"paid troublemakers\" in a Truth Social post. \"Paid ‘troublemakers’ are attending Republican Town Hall Meetings. It is all part of the game for the Democrats, but just like our big LANDSLIDE ELECTION, it’s not going to work for them!\" Trump wrote.

The former Vice President got rocked in the 2024 election by President Donald Trump. America's 45th and 47th President won the Electoral College, the popular vote and Republicans hold both chambers of Congress. One of Harris' biggest issues was that she was terrible with the media. You simply never knew what was going to happen whenever she opened her mouth, and that led to her team trying to hide and protect her. Shawn Ryan exposes Kamala Harris. Popular podcaster Shawn Ryan - one of the best in the game - revealed during an interview with Forbes just how absurd it was trying to book Harris during the campaign. Specifically, he wanted to discuss the horrific withdrawal from Afghanistan during her time in the White House. Her campaign made it clear it had zero interest in doing that. You can watch Shawn Ryan break it down in the video below starting around 15:00, and make sure to let me know your thoughts at David.Hookstead@outkick.com. These comments from Ryan perfectly sum up why Kamala Harris did so poorly in the election. President Donald Trump was willing to speak to just about anyone with a platform who wanted to interview him. Whether it was Joe Rogan, Shawn Ryan, Theo Von or someone else, Trump was more than willing to engage in conversations and debates with people. He's also famous for not being afraid to discuss any topic. Imagine Kamala Harris ever having an honest moment like this during an unscripted interview. Now, Trump is back in the White House and Kamala Harris has already seemingly faded from memory. Her campaign's attempts to hide her will be studied for years when it comes to what not to do.

The official was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nThe visit to Moscow comes after Ukraine on Tuesday agreed to a US proposal for a 30-day ceasefire in the war with Russia. The US administration hopes the Kremlin will quickly sign on as well.\n\nWitkoff, who turns 68 on Saturday, is at the forefront of complex negotiations on Gaza and Ukraine from a perch that did not require Senate confirmation. \n\nHere is what you need to know about a man who has quickly become a key player in the Trump administration.\n\nWitkoff flew to Russia for talks last month that led to a prisoner swap that freed Marc Fogel, an American history teacher the US had deemed wrongfully detained.\n\nFogel was arrested in August 2021 and was serving a 14-year prison sentence. His family and supporters said he had been traveling with medically prescribed marijuana. Alexander Vinnik, a Russian cryptocurrency expert who faced Bitcoin fraud charges in the United States, was released to Russia in the prisoner swap.\n\nWitkoff developed a rapport with his Russian interlocutor, Kirill Dmitriev, the head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, during those successful negotiations, according to retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, Trump’s special envoy to Ukraine and Russia.\n\nIn perhaps a sign of diplomatic polish, Witkoff gave much credit to an important Trump ally, Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, for bringing Fogel home.\n\n“He was a cheerleader for this rapprochement where the two leaders would come together, and that’s what happened, so thank God,” Witkoff said. “Sometimes you don’t get a good result. Here we got a very good result. Mark Fogel is the evidence of that.”\n\nJust weeks after his victory over Kamala Harris in November and before he was inaugurated, Trump dispatched Witkoff to the Mideast to begin work with Joe Biden's team on winning a hostage and temporary ceasefire deal.\n\nTrump praised Witkoff, who shuttled between Tel Aviv and Doha, for helping seal the agreement that's led to a weeks-long ceasefire and 33 hostages being freed from Hamas captivity in exchange for the release of nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. \n\nWitkoff, in turn, deflected praise to Trump, suggesting that the deal would have never come to fruition without him coming to power.\n\nThe way to freeing the remaining 59 hostages, of whom Israel has declared 35 to be dead, could be an even tougher negotiation.\n\nThe first phase of the negotiated ceasefire ended last month with no clarity on what comes next since the agreement’s second phase has not yet been hammered out. A fragile truce holds for the moment.\n\nIsrael is now pushing what Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has referred to as the “Witkoff proposal.\" It would require Hamas to release half its remaining hostages — the militant group’s main bargaining chip — in exchange for a ceasefire extension and a promise to negotiate a lasting truce. \n\nIsrael has made no mention of releasing more Palestinian prisoners — a key component of the first phase.\n\nWitkoff, who runs a real estate development and investment firm, is a longtime friend and golf partner of Trump. He played a less visible role during Trump's first term, serving on the board of trustees for the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. \n\nWitkoff first met Trump in the 1980s, when he worked for a real estate law firm that handled a deal for Trump, himself a real estate developer, according to testimony Witkoff gave in the president's civil fraud trial in 2023. \n\nWitkoff testified that a few years later, he ran into Trump at a deli. Trump didn't have money with him and asked Witkoff to order him a ham and Swiss cheese sandwich. Years later when they met again, Trump remembered the sandwich and the two became friends, Witkoff said.\n\nHe's been more than a friend. Witkoff has donated millions to Trump's political causes over the years. He also partnered with Trump on the president's family cryptocurrency venture, World Liberty Financial.\n\nWitkoff started off as a real estate attorney who went on to found a management company that focused on residential buildings in New York City. In 1997, he founded his namesake real estate firm, Witkoff, where he currently serves as chairman and chief executive officer. He's now Florida-based, like Trump, and has golfed with him there. \n\nWitkoff was on the golf course with Trump in West Palm Beach, Florida, in September during the second attempt on Trump’s life last year. He spoke to Fox News Channel host Sean Hannity afterward, relaying some details about how it unfolded and how Secret Service agents pounced on Trump to protect him. \n\nHe was among Trump's handpicked speakers at the Republican National Convention in July, along with his son Zach Witkoff, who works at the family real estate firm.\n\nThe elder Witkoff spent much of his RNC speech describing the comfort that Trump has provided him and his family as they've grieved the death of his adult son Andrew, who died of an opioid overdose in 2011. \n\nWitkoff last month told hostage families that the loss of Andrew has helped him understand the importance of bringing home the dead hostages still being held by Hamas so their family and friends can properly grieve them.\n\n“I am a member of that club that's buried a child,” Witkoff said. “It's a bad club.”\n\nWitkoff addressed the Madison Square Garden rally Trump held in October and spoke about how New York had changed since he grew up. He argued Trump could fix it. \n\nWitkoff let Trump use his private plane at times during the campaign and he helped Trump make peace with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis after a bitter divide stemming from the Republican governor's failed 2024 presidential campaign. Witkoff helped set up a meeting between Trump and DeSantis at his Shell Bay Club in Hollywood, Florida.\n\nAfter Trump won the election, he named Witkoff as one of the two co-chairs of his inaugural committee, along with former Georgia Sen. Kelly Loeffler, who is now leading the Small Business Administration. \n\nTrump then gave Witkoff a much bigger job, naming him as his special envoy to the Middle East. His weighty job portfolio has since become even bigger.","summary":"Steve Witkoff became friends with Trump over a deli sandwich – he is now a key man in the administration","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/steve-witkoff-trump-putin-ukraine-ceasefire-talks-b2715103.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/13/13/Witkoff_57330.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-14 11:11:31","author":"Michelle L.

But now that the Trumpers are in the White House, they’re starting to tally it up. \n\nThe numbers are anywhere between $300 billion and $250 billion depending on how you measure and classify the largesse. Robbert van Batenburg, of the influential Bear Traps market report, says his analysis backs up those estimates. Wall Street executives who delved into the matter say the Bidenistas were able to paper over the spending though the chicanery of rolling over short-term debt instead of issuing longer-dated bonds that would have causes a spike in interest rates, a stock market selloff and probably a recession.\n\nHowever big the bill, everyone agrees that it’s a lot of money that the bloated federal government doesn’t have. You can’t roll over debt forever because investors get wise to the game and then keep demanding ever higher interest rates to lend the government money. \n\nTeam Trump tells On The Money the hole they’re in is large and will take a while to dig out from. They are still rolling over short-term debt because they don’t want to upset the interest rates environment. Meanwhile, they’re banking on the cuts by Elon Musk’s DOGE team are to make sure interest rates don’t blow out to levels that could cause a deep recession because of all the debt and spending.\n\nThe numbers don’t lie: A budget deficit approaching $2 trillion (by comparison, Trump’s last pre-COVID deficit was $984 billion) and $37 trillion in debt, which leaves you little choice. It’s either DOGE and other cuts that translate into short-term pain, or a massive spike in interest rates down the road that could lead to a recession or worse. \n\nAs I’ve written, the markets are focusing on short-term pain and of course tariffs. Bond trading is signaling a recession, even if the economy was likely slowing before Trump took office in late January. Stocks are freaking out over tariffs because they translate into a surcharge on imports that leads to retaliatory measures from targeted countries then inflation and a possible recession. \n\nPlus, they think the Trump DOGE reduction in government spending – including the end of Biden’s last-minute binge to elect Harris — will slow economic growth.\n\nRightly or wrongly, Team Trump sees the glass half full. They think they can pay down the deficit and debt with money from tariffs; DOGE could cut $500 billion from the deficit and lower interest rates in the long run, which is also good for growth, as are the planned tax cuts and deregulation.\n\nInterest rates would have blown out if Harris got elected because she was planning to double down on Biden’s idiotic spending. \n\nThe trading in the 10-year might be signaling recession, but it’s also signaling the need to issue less debt.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year yield that consumer rates are priced off of was heading to 5% because bond traders sniffed out the spending Biden was doing to elect Harris. It’s now heading to 4% and below.\n\nJoe Biden was asleep for most of his presidency – when he wasn’t spending money that he didn’t have. He hasn’t been heard from much now that he’s in retirement, but if he ever manages to wake up from his extended slumber, someone might want to ask him why electing Kamala Harris was worth all that spending and the hole he left for Trump.","summary":"However big the bill, everyone agrees that it's a lot of money that the bloated federal government doesn't have.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/03/14/business/biden-ran-up-insane-bills-before-he-left-the-white-house-heres-how-trump-plans-to-pay-them-down/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/Trump-Bills_0babb0.gif?w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/Z09INign-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-03-14 11:00:00","author":"Charles Gasparino","authors":["Charles Gasparino"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.243},{"id":300133424,"title":"Democrats start gaming out 2028 election weeks into Trump’s second term","text":"“Any Democrat that I vote for in 2028, I want them to be making noise right now,” said Michael Ceraso, a Democratic strategist who has worked on multiple presidential campaigns. “I want them to be building up state party infrastructures and using their resources and times to help either the state that they’re serving or the party.”\n\nTopping the list of 2028 hopefuls at the moment are a host of Democratic governors, most notably Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA), but also figures like Govs. Gretchen Whitmer (D-MI), Wes Moore (D-MD), Josh Shapiro (D-PA), Andy Beshear (D-KY), and JB Pritzker (D-IL).\n\nWhile a governor might seem like a natural candidate for president, the Democratic Party has not run a sitting governor at the top of its ticket since Bill Clinton of Arkansas in 1992. The GOP, meanwhile, placed current or former governors atop its ticket in 2000, 2004, and 2012, and many on the Right feel that Trump fits the mold as the chief executive of a sprawling business empire.\n\n“Democrats should take a good hard look at the governors,” Democratic strategist Brad Bannon said. “I think it would be helpful if we had a nominee who wasn’t deeply exposed to the Beltway.”\n\nAs the Democratic Party seeks new leadership, the experience of a top executive working far from Washington, D.C., might look attractive, and of the gaggle of governors generating buzz, California’s Newsom has long been the buzziest.\n\nNewsom has dominated the 2028 discussion for years, taking out ads in Florida and debating Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) in what was widely seen as a presidential warmup act back in 2023. He’s now hosting conservatives on his new podcast and suggesting that transgender participation in sports is “deeply unfair” in what could be a pivot to the center ahead of a possible run.\n\nConservative media personality Charlie Kirk, who was the first guest on Newsom’s podcast, warned Republicans to be on guard against him, writing that the California governor “has a shark’s instincts and is hoping that voters will have a goldfish’s memory.”\n\nNewsom is far from assured of victory if he does enter the 2028 fray, however. Pritzker, another top blue state governor, has a stop scheduled in early primary state New Hampshire and is being coy about his political future.\n\n“I will be in this fight,” he told reporters on Thursday. “I have always been, as you know, an active participant in issues that matter to me, and the Trump presidency is attacking virtually everything I believe in. So whether I’m in office or I’m not in office, or what office I am serving in, I will always be in this fight.”\n\nWhile Newsom and Pritzker represent solid blue territory, figures like Shapiro, Whitmer, and Beshear can claim cross-party appeal for representing states that Trump won. Whoever wins will likely be able to reshape the party as it looks to create a new identity over the next few years.\n\n“The problem with the Democrats right now is that they cannot get together and come up with a message,” said Sasha Tirador, a Florida-based Democratic strategist. “The 2028 race will really depend on where we are as Americans four years from now. Right now, we’re not in a good place.”\n\nThe possible contenders\n\nWhile few Democratic senators outside of Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA) are drawing much 2028 speculation, a handful of figures from outside of the upper chamber, and some from outside of politics completely, are drawing nascent interest.\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) has established herself as a strong voice for the progressive wing of the Democratic Party and is a near-constant presence in political news cycles. At 35, she would be an enormous swing away from the recent bipartisan trend of nominating figures in their 60s and 70s.\n\nFormer White House press secretary Jen Psaki has called for generational change in Democratic leadership going forward, and even Trump suggested Ocasio-Cortez should “keep trying” after she failed to secure the top Democratic position on the influential House Oversight Committee.\n\nAt the opposite end of the nontraditional spectrum is former first lady Michelle Obama, 61, who continues to top the presidential wish list for some on the Left. Similar to Newsom, Obama recently announced she is launching a podcast, giving her a public platform during Trump’s second term.\n\nAnother outsider drawing lots of speculation is Pete Buttigieg, the former South Bend, Indiana, mayor, 2020 presidential candidate, and secretary of transportation. Buttigieg announced this week that he won’t run for Senate in his adopted home state of Michigan, opening up a 2028 path should he choose to pursue it.\n\nButtigieg won the 2020 Iowa caucus and made a habit of appearing on Fox News during his run at the Transportation Department. But his tenure in the Biden administration proved controversial, and he has never held elected office above the local level.\n\nFor those looking for a true political outsider in the mold of Trump, there is the outspoken ESPN commentator Stephen A. Smith.\n\nSmith, 57, has a huge audience thanks to his decades on television, similar to Trump’s lengthy run on The Apprentice prior to his 2016 campaign, and wields an authentic and entertaining style that keeps him in the headlines.\n\nHe has repeatedly called out the Democratic Party since Trump’s election, saying it needs to find a new direction.\n\n“If you’re the Democratic Party and you lost 49.8% to 48.3% and you’re looking at that 1.5% difference, that’s an excuse to say, ‘What we did really wasn’t that bad. We should continue to do that.’ No, don’t continue to do that. Find a new strategy,” Smith said on ABC’s The View. “In the end, what it comes down to is this, the American people, in their eyes, it wasn’t about him. They were voting against what the Democrats were throwing in their direction.”\n\nSmith fueled some of the 2028 speculation himself, saying in February that “the Democratic Party looks so pathetic after this election, I might entertain running.”\n\nWhat may matter as much as the candidate is the message they send out on the campaign trail.\n\nIn 2024, Trump pushed hard against “wokeness” on the Left, most notably with his now infamous commercial saying, “Kamala [Harris] is for they/them. President Trump is for you.”\n\nThat commercial largely centered on Harris’s strong support for transgender issues, something Newsom is already distancing himself from. The Democratic National Committee has also signaled it is ready to focus more on the economy and less on identity, with new DNC Chairman Ken Martin writing that the Democratic Party “always has been and always will be the party of the worker.”\n\n“I believe the canary in the coal mine for what happened on Nov. 5 was the recent showing that, for the first time in modern history, Americans now see the Republicans as the party of the working class and Democrats as the party of the elites,” Martin wrote. “As the Trump agenda fails our nation’s working communities, we have to take seriously the job of repairing and restoring the perceptions of our party and our brand.”\n\nFive Democrats in prime position to be face of the party in 2028\n\nTirador, the Democratic strategist, agreed, saying voters of all stripes want to hear about the economy.\n\n“The middle class is what makes this country great. This country has always been great at giving people a shot at the American dream, and the middle class is disappearing in this country,” she said. “I want to hear about how we’re going to get back and grow the middle class.”\n\nMabinty Quarshie contributed to this story.","summary":"President Donald Trump&#8216;s second term has just started, but Democrats are already fired up at the prospect of the 2028 presidential contest, and some are quietly making moves to position themselves for a run.

As Cutter and Thomas note, chief executives weren’t such fraidy cats during Trump’s first term. Back then, CEOs like Apple’s Tim Cook and JP Morgan Chase’s Jamie Dimon were out front not only criticizing Trump but urging others to do so. “Our jobs as CEOs now include driving what we think is right,” Brian Moynihan, CEO at Bank of America, told the Journal’s Monica Langley in 2016. “It’s not exactly political activism, but it is action on issues beyond business.”\n\nNine years later, Moynihan is still CEO at Bank of America, but he’s no longer calling his fellow chief executives to the barricades. That may have something to do with the tongue lashing Trump gave him at Davos earlier this year for not lending enough to conservative organizations (an implausible accusation that Bank of America denied). Trump levelled the same accusation at Dimon (and JP Morgan similarly denied it). Dimon issued some strong words following the January 6 insurrection, but he changed his tune in 2024, praising Trump’s economic policies and later joining the long list of wealthy or otherwise prominent Americans scared off from endorsing Democrat Kamala Harris in 2024.

The odds of the latter will go way up if Trump carries through on his threat to default on some United States treasuries, or if the Treasury moves forward with the so-called “Mar-a-Lago plan” that would give United States bondholders a buzz cut.\n\nYet here is what Goldman Sachs Chairman and Chief Executive Officer David Solomon told Fox Business this week after Trump met with the Business Roundtable, an organization of CEOs:\n\n","url":"https://newrepublic.com/article/192742/trump-plutocratic-pals-nation-biggest-cowards","image":"https://images.newrepublic.com/7a8b6664b66cdecef984cb70394db4440e7f85d4.jpeg?w=1200&h=630&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-14 10:00:00","author":"Timothy Noah","authors":["Timothy Noah"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.159},{"id":300115958,"title":"Beleaguered Bank of America head Brian Moynihan ‘holding the bank back’: source","text":"Most major bank CEOs — like Jamie Dimon and David Solomon — have adapted since Donald Trump took office: Weighing in on economic policy, getting clarity on issues like tariffs, and publicly acknowledging Trump’s eagerness to work with the business community. They understand, it seems, that an olive branch is the way to stay relevant.\n\nAnd then there’s Bank of America’s Brian Moynihan, whose long-standing strained relationship with the president seems to be holding back the bank’s ability to evolve, I’ve been told.\n\nOne source said that, unlike Solomon and Dimon, Moynihan is largely “in the shadows … he’s not a leader.”\n\n“He is the anti-Jamie Dimon” a source explained. “He’s holding the bank back.”\n\nOther banks have been able to move on from woke policies that were once de-rigueur and reinvent themselves in a way that gives them a seat at Trump’s table — applauding the policies they appreciate and even conducting interviews with the president’s favorite outlets.\n\nBut insiders say Moynihan’s resistance goes deeper than simply playing politics — they think it’s because he “won’t take any risk,” period.\n\n“He hasn’t done one M&A deal, he’s done nothing to help the bank grow, and high level executives are thinking about leaving,” one source who has worked with the bank said. \n\nOne analyst who spoke on the condition of anonymity said there may be an upside to a more cautious approach, “There is a flip side … if it turns out there is a lot of froth in the market, the aversion to risk might pay off.”\n\nDespite joking he is “still having fun” 15 years into his tenure, the last few months haven’t exactly been a joyride for Moynihan.\n\nA source close to BoA notes that it’s still one of the top investment banks in the world.\n\nThis week, it was reported that BoA slashed 200 investment banking jobs, on the tailwind of 150 heads being chopped in the markets and banking divisions last month.\n\n“Part of business is getting beat up… but he’s just having everyone grind it out rather than grow,” a source with knowledge of the bank’s operations adds.\n\n“He just fires people to make margins better” — rather than focusing on acquisitions or pushing for more dealmaking, one employee said.\n\nIn January, the CEO faced a public lashing from Trump at Davos over alleged debanking practices. \n\n“I hope you start opening your bank to conservatives, because many conservatives complain that the banks are not allowing them to do business within the bank … What you’re doing is wrong,” Trump said in a virtual appearance as Moynihan sat on stage.\n\nSources believe Trump’s victory was essentially a double whammy for the CEO — putting the bank in the crosshairs but also halting his own political aspirations.\n\nMoynihan had been considering ways to make a graceful exit, they say, and had hoped for a senior level post should Kamala Harris win. While he was eyeing treasury secretary — a job basically every single executive on Wall Street fancies — in a Democrat regime, he would likely have settled for less. \n\nSend NYNext a tip: nynextlydia@nypost.com","summary":"Sources believe Trump’s victory was essentially a double whammy for the CEO — putting the bank in the crosshairs but also halting his own political aspirations.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/03/14/business/bank-of-america-head-brian-moynihan-holding-the-bank-back/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/next.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-14 10:00:00","author":"Lydia Moynihan","authors":["Lydia Moynihan"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.134},{"id":300122476,"title":"He Used to Make Videos About NYC Real Estate. Then He Became Radicalized by the Right.","text":"Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nWhen the COVID-19 pandemic hit in spring 2020, tens of thousands of apartments in New York City suddenly became available as residents fled the city in droves. All of a sudden, one of the world’s most competitive rental markets found itself with very few renters.\n\n“Things totally changed,” Cash Jordan, a licensed real estate broker in the city, said in an interview with the trade publication the Real Deal. “Renters were in high demand. There are just so many empty apartments, and the supply and demand just flip-flopped.”\n\nTo survive as a realtor in this unprecedented market, Jordan got creative. He started posting several times a week, to his YouTube account, videos of himself walking through his listings. The footage often opened with b-roll from around the neighborhood, followed by introductions to hidden neighborhood gems, like coffee shops or restaurants. During these virtual showings, he injected lighthearted commentary, sometimes even poking fun at an apartment’s cramped closet or tiny bathroom.\n\nBut five years since he posted his first virtual showing video and almost two decades since he moved here, Jordan—who was one of New York City’s most well-known realtors on YouTube, promoting the dream of living here—has now become one of its most vocal critics. Once innocuous videos, such as “Living in a Tiny Box-Apartment on an NYC Roof” or “SEE a $2,900 Brooklyn PENTHOUSE with ROOF DECK and a BALCONY,” have given way to clickbait titles like “NYC is Now So Dangerous … Nobody Can Live Here,” “NYC Installs Cameras … To Tax Trump Supporters,” and “Venezuelan Gang Invades Manhattan … As NYC Collapses.”\n\nEqually misleading are his preview thumbnails, which now exclusively feature images that appear to have been created by generative A.I. tools to depict throngs of gangs or rioters flooding every corner of the city, evoking scenes reminiscent of The Walking Dead rather than bustling Midtown Manhattan.\n\nWhile surprising, Jordan’s heel turn is just one example of a larger trend of creators taking advantage of social media algorithms that reward sensationalism and fearmongering over facts. Since YouTube is now one of the most popular sources of news in America, the site has become a target for creators and news influencers like Jordan to leverage their platforms and parlay them into lucrative sponsorship deals—at the expense of their audiences and the truth.\n\n“Fundamentally, this is all about the algorithm,” Claire Wardle, an associate professor at Cornell University and a leading expert on misinformation and user-generated content, told Slate. “In many ways, these videos emulated Trump’s remarks, Fox News, or One America News. But this is not Trump or the Murdochs, but just a dude who may have figured out a way to maybe make a ton of money.”\n\nJordan did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nIn recent months, Jordan has landed multiple brand sponsorships, from a large personal-injury law firm to a local moving company. Meanwhile, his channel has ballooned to more than 1.2 million subscribers at the time of reporting, a number that surpasses many local TV stations and outlets on YouTube. But instead of providing news grounded in facts, Jordan wields his megaphone to falsely portray New York as a real-life Gotham City. His stories cite migrants overwhelming the city, criminals running amok in the subways, and homeless people “destroying” its beloved public parks, claims that have led some tourists to question whether they should reconsider their plans to visit and others to wonder if it’s safe to take the subway at all. Some original fans have lamented that this once fun and informative property channel has become a hub for demonstrably untrue claims about New York City, with some accusing Jordan of grifting and capitalizing on the age-old fear of the crime-ridden urban center.\n\nJordan has found a successful niche by sensationalizing crime and chaos in one of the world’s most populated and frequently visited cities. Since he posted the first series of videos on these topics starting in late 2023, engagement of his videos have soared, leading his subscriber number to double within a year. Many of his videos now garner more than a million views.\n\nHis rise in popularity may provide another example of how technology and profit motives enable misinformation to spread easily. Americans are increasingly being misled not by Macedonian teens or the Russian intelligence service, but by creators who see a viable business model in simply amplifying misleading narratives and reinforcing division in an already deeply polarized society.\n\nFor example, Jordan’s relentless fearmongering about subway safety and alternative transportation—including the ongoing plan to expand protected bike lanes throughout the five boroughs—not only is misleading online but may have bolstered arguments from local and national politicians against initiatives aimed at making commuting safer and reducing car reliance. In 2024 vehicle collisions resulted in 251 fatalities, including 147 pedestrians and cyclists, while 10 people lost their lives on the subway.\n\nIn recent years, social media platforms have either drastically loosened their moderation policies or eliminated fact-checking altogether in the United States, reverting to an approach before QAnon memes and “Plandemic” videos flooded the internet. That wave of disinformation helped fuel the violent Jan. 6 riots, during which thousands of extreme supporters of Donald Trump used these same platforms to mobilize and attempt to stop the peaceful transfer of power.\n\nCritics have long argued that social media platforms don’t just enable misinformation but incentivize it, rewarding misleading content by sharing ad revenue with creators and providing features that help them sell merchandise or collect donations from fans. Take Tim Pool as an example. The former Occupy Wall Street livestreamer turned alt-right talking head has frequently hosted supporters of QAnon, “Stop the Steal,” and other conspiracy theories on his shows over the years—and has in the past four years taken in more than $1.3 million in fan donations on YouTube alone.\n\nTo be fair, not all news influencers profit from misinformation and polarization. But a Pew Research study from last fall found that some of the most popular news influencers in the United States are disproportionately male and tend to be more right-leaning politically. And that’s why many postelection pundits hypothesized that Joe Rogan and other prominent “podcast bros” have helped rehabilitate Trump and expand his reach, while negative content about Kamala Harris from news influencers was twice as likely to be critical, according to Pew. But the opportunity to profit from advertising revenue and sponsorship money has also attracted side hustlers just like Jordan, who hope to generate income outside their full-time jobs.\n\nAlso of concern, as some social media users have noticed, is the proliferation of so-called faceless accounts. These are creators who have learned that they can rack up views on YouTube by repurposing highly partisan culture-war material—often from cable networks and right-wing influencers—into news clips. On some occasions, these “faceless” creators have openly boasted about their monetization strategies and how they use A.I. tools to generate thumbnails and titles and even automate their entire workflow.\n\n“7 million views a month,” one such creator boasted in an X post, in which they also claimed that they earned tens of thousands of dollars from multiple YouTube channels specializing in anti-woke content such as “When Elon Musk DESTROYED a Woke Reporter …” and “ALL Celebrity & Liberal Meltdowns As Trump WINS ELECTION.”\n\nCombating this misinformation used to be the responsibility of the platforms themselves. However, due to recent content moderation policy changes and attitude shifts in Big Tech in the wake of the 2024 election, these platforms are largely shirking these duties—leaving their users to fend for themselves.\n\n“In 2020 you might have asked the platforms to do more. But we’re in a different era now,” Wardle said. She added that the issue is exacerbated by emerging technology such as A.I. As such, she’s concerned that the information environment is only becoming more polluted and that the public will have a much harder time accessing quality information.\n\nTo spot false news or A.I.–generated visual content, media literacy experts and fact-checkers often advise readers to look out for vague or overly exaggerated language, inconsistencies in images such as mismatched shadows or unnatural proportions, and visuals that appear almost too perfect to be real. And if readers decide to share content on social media, they recommend verifying the context and tracing the original source to ensure accuracy.\n\nHannah Covington, of the News Literacy Project, told Slate that it’s crucial “to be able to understand what credibility looks like” and “recognize it in action.”\n\n“These are ‘digital survival skills,’ ” she added.\n\nStill, stronger moderation and algorithmic oversight by social media companies is essential to curb misinformation on their own platforms. But with Big Tech in the U.S. moving in the exact opposite direction, spreading misinformation is going to get a lot easier—while spotting it gets a whole lot harder.","summary":"Cash Jordan made a name for himself showing off New York apartments.

Elon Musk is upending the politics of EVs.","text":"President Donald Trump, the same man who once said that people promoting electric vehicles should “ROT IN HELL,” bought his own EV this week. He showed off his new Tesla Model S — red, like the Make America Great Again hats — outside the White House on Tuesday, piling compliments on his senior advisor Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, and declaring the company’s vehicles “beautiful.”\n\nIt resembled a sales pitch for Musk’s company, the country’s biggest seller of EVs. Tesla has lost more than half of its value since December as sales have plummeted worldwide. With Musk dismantling parts of the federal government as the head of the new Department of Government Efficiency, aka DOGE, the vehicles have become a toxic symbol for Democrats, a large portion of Tesla owners. Over the past week, protesters have vandalized Tesla dealerships, set Cybertrucks aflame, and boycotted the brand. Liberal Tesla drivers have slapped stickers on their cars that read “I bought this before Elon went crazy.” \n\nThe strong feelings surrounding Musk have already started to scramble the politics around EVs. Trump’s exhibition at the White House on Tuesday was a defense of Musk, who he said had been unfairly penalized for “finding all sorts of terrible things that have taken place against our country.” Yet the bizarre scene of Trump showcasing a vehicle that runs on electricity instead of gas felt almost like a sketch from Saturday Night Live, and not just because the Trump administration has been trying to reverse Biden-era rules that would have sped up the adoption of low-emissions vehicles. Here were the two biggest characters in MAGA politics promoting a technology that’s been largely rejected by their right-wing base. \n\nOther prominent Republicans, including House Speaker Mike Johnson and Georgia Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, quickly moved to defend Tesla against vandalism that Trump is labeling “domestic terrorism.” Tesla’s sudden shift from Democratic status symbol to Republican icon has some thinking the controversy around Musk could lead to a bipartisan embrace of EVs.\n\n“He’s uniquely positioned to and has the power to really shape this debate and help bridge the divide here,” said Joe Sacks, executive director of the American EV Jobs Alliance, a nonprofit trying to prevent “silly partisan politics” from stopping a manufacturing boom for electric vehicles. “I’m unsure if that’s what he’s going to use his new perch and his kind of role in the administration to do, but it seems like he has the ability to do that.” \n\nAccording to polling the alliance conducted after the November election, Republicans have warmed up to Elon Musk, with 82 percent of those polled saying that Musk is a good ambassador for EVs. A solid majority of Trump voters — 64 percent — said they viewed Tesla favorably, compared with 59 percent of those who voted for Kamala Harris. “Republicans are probably inching towards the idea that there shouldn’t be much of a cultural divide on this product category, if the market leader CEO is sitting next to President Trump in the Oval Office during press conferences,” Sacks said.\n\nThe data aligns with a recent analysis from the financial services firm Stifel, which found that Tesla has become more favorable among Republicans as its popularity plunges with Democrats. Compared to August, 13 percent more Republicans are willing to consider purchasing a Tesla.\n\nYet there are reasons to suspect that EVs will continue to be a hard sell for Republicans. They are typically tradition-minded people who like big cars, not small cars with new technology they’ve never used before, said Marc Hetherington, a political scientist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and co-author of the book Prius Or Pickup? “Conservatives don’t have the sensibility that fits with electric vehicles at all,” he said. “So I don’t think that you’re going to see a spike in Tesla sales among conservatives.”\n\nAlexander Edwards, president of the research consultancy Strategic Vision, said that Republicans view gas-powered cars as a more practical purchase for transporting their families from place to place. That’s based on his firm’s surveys, which examine the psychology behind the car choices of about a quarter-million Americans a year. “I think Elon made a bet that I think he’s secretly regretting, that Republicans would come out of the woodwork and say, ‘Yes, we’re going to support you,’” Edwards said.\n\nIf they came around to any electric vehicle, however, it might be a Tesla. One of the primary things Republicans care about when it comes to buying a car is that it looks fast and goes fast, and Tesla has seen more Republican buyers for that reason, Edwards said. Democrats have consistently been buying electric vehicles at a rate of 4 to 1 compared to Republicans, but 2 to 1 when it comes to Teslas, according to Edwards’ data. Last year, more Republicans than Democrats bought Teslas for the first time — not because more Republican flocked to the brand, but because Democrats pulled away from it.\n\nFor Democrats, who had long been criticized as having a smug attitude for driving a Prius, Teslas offered a cool and desirable alternative with less baggage when they took off in the early 2010s. “Tesla was able to finally give Democratic buyers what they were looking for — a Prius-like image of being thoughtful, combined with the fun and excitement of a real luxury sports car,” Edwards said. That started to change as Musk became a magnet for political controversy, starting with his takeover of Twitter in 2022. A Tesla EV became a symbol of Tesla’s CEO. \n\n“Doesn’t matter if you’re Republican or Democrat — when you jump into the Batmobile, you become Batman,” Edwards said. “And the same thing is true with the vehicles we purchase. We often want them to show who we are, what we’ve accomplished, what we stand for.”\n\nOf course, there are ways to depolarize electric vehicles that don’t rely on cues from Trump or Musk. Sacks recommends talking about the attributes of electric vehicles: their ability to accelerate faster and brake more crisply, as well as help people save money for every mile they drive, since there’s no need to buy gas. When people have friends or family who own an EV, that also helps break down the cultural divide, he said.\n\nIn a way, you could see Trump becoming a salesman for electric vehicles as an example of that very phenomenon, with his self-described “first buddy” convincing him to come around. Just two years ago, Trump complained that EVs needed a charge every 15 minutes and would kill American jobs. But, after Musk endorsed his presidential campaign last summer and donated $288 million, Trump softened his tone, saying that he was in favor of “a very small slice” of cars being electric. “I have to be, you know,” Trump said, “because Elon endorsed me very strongly.” \n\nOn Tuesday, as Trump climbed into his new electric car for the first time, he seemed surprised by what he saw there. “That’s beautiful,” he said, admiring the dashboard. “This is a different panel than I’ve had. Everything’s computer!”","summary":"Teslas were once a green status symbol.

Musk was among the largest donors (at over US$290 million, according to the Federal Election Commission) but there were plenty more super-rich Americans who joined the fray – 150 of the world’s wealthiest families contributed an estimated US$2 billion.\nCommentators galore are concerned that government policy (not just in the US, but in other democracies) is being disproportionately shaped by the wealthy, and that rising wealth inequality has made this a direct threat to democratic institutions. They look not only at Musk (who of course has no formal government position) but at the billionaires and multimillionaires filling so many of Trump’s cabinet positions.\n\nA UK group called Patriotic Millionaires polled more than 2,900 millionaires across G20 countries in November and December last year, and found that two-thirds said the super-rich “interfered inappropriately” in the US elections and in shaping public opinion. And these are all millionaires themselves.\nThese questions about the alarming erosion of democratic institutions will take time to resolve. The more immediate question is how long Musk’s bizarre explosion of activity can last, and whether he is set to become a modern-day Icarus who, so inflamed by his hubris, will see his wings melt and come crashing spectacularly to earth.\nParallels between Musk and Icarus are well worn. There is reportedly an old Tesla joke warning staff to beware getting too close to Musk lest they get burned. The parallel also fits well with Musk’s curious and long-standing obsession with settling on Mars. But thus far, he has continued to fly steadily higher, and still his wings are intact.\nOr are they? As of March 14, his net worth has fallen by more than US$100 billion this year, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. For most mortals, such a crash would have been fatal. But Musk is flying still, though there is some evidence his wings have been clipped, even in his primary role as the “Dogefather”, championing efforts to gut government spending through the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (Doge).\nTrump has had to deny a report that Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Transport Secretary Sean Duffy clashed with Musk during a cabinet meeting over the firing of their employees. Ever the deal maker, Trump has ruled that formal firings would in future be left to department heads.\n\nDespite strong Republican support for draining the Washington swamp, many have concluded Musk’s bull-in-a-china-shop ignorance of how federal government works is only causing damage, that federal government cost-cutting is going to require a scalpel rather than a sledgehammer.\nSome have also raised questions about Musk’s conflict of interest, homing in on an apparent reluctance to go after cost-cutting in the Pentagon: Musk’s companies reportedly have at least 100 government contracts spread across 17 agencies, including SpaceX and Starlink contracts with the Pentagon. SpaceX alone has around US$22 billion in contracts with the defence department, mostly with Nasa, the space agency.\nMany China hawks surrounding Trump and his cabinet are also apparently concerned about Musk’s conflict of interest in China, which Tesla relies heavily on for its electric vehicle and battery businesses. There are unanswered questions about how Trump’s tariff war with China will affect Tesla’s business there and in the US. Is he also vulnerable in that Tesla has paid no federal income taxes in the US in two of the past three years?\n\nDespite the antipathy many around Trump voice towards Musk, most are wary of predicting a fall from grace. It seems clear many in political power fear his influence on Trump and his financial power to destroy their political careers. As Edward Luce at the Financial Times noted: “A US$50m cheque to fund a primary challenge could end a senator’s career – US$10 million for a legislator.” So too could Musk’s muscular use of X, regarded as “Maga’s informal state broadcast arm”.\nSo for now, this modern-day Icarus continues to soar, and it is a brave person who dares forecast his fall, despite the dangers of a private citizen gaining such a firm hold on the levers of power. I agree with Max Hastings at Bloomberg: “It is in the best interests of all our democracies for Musk and indeed all rich men, to stick to making money, and leave governance to professional politicians and voters. Fat chance.”","summary":"This unprecedented empowerment of the US ‘political donor class’ risks jeopardising the proper functioning of democracy.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/opinion/world-opinion/article/3302289/elon-musk-and-worrying-political-reach-super-rich","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/03/14/49c5ffd7-7ef4-4383-a6e7-1c350e674c26_5986665c.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-14 08:30:08","author":"David Dodwell","authors":["David Dodwell"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.11},{"id":300085964,"title":"Tim Walz Resurfaces With Comically Stupid Idea That Will Be A Disaster","text":"Tim Walz is back, and he's resurfaced with a terrible idea.

wrong","text":"On issues from Trump to Syria, Alastair Campbell and Rory Stewart’s wildly popular podcast The Rest is Politics is actively making its millions of listeners less informed, says James Price\n\n“I wasn’t fundamentally wrong because I was patronising to people. I was wrong because I’m an optimist and I hate the idea of being wrong pessimistically. You can align yourself with the worst instincts of humanity… or you can hope. My bet on Harris was a bet on the American people. It was a bet on hope.”\n\nSo goes the sum total of self-reflection from Rory Stewart, former cabinet minister, Prime Ministerial hopeful and co-host of The Rest Is Politics podcast. \n\nIt followed the wildly successful podcast (co-presented by former Blair Spin Doctor and dossier sexer-upper Alastair Campbell) making bold, confident predictions that former Vice President Kamala Harris would win the US Presidential election comfortably.\n\nThe rest, as we know, is history; Donald Trump won the popular vote, every swing state and both houses of Congress. Listening to this show in the run-up to 5 November last year, then, would have made you actively less well-informed. If I wanted to listen to two patronising men prognosticate with supreme confidence about topics on which they knew little, I would just grab one mate and go to the pub. \n\nWorse than this, they recently flew to Syria to interview Ahmed al-Sharaa, the ex- Al-Qaeda guerrilla, turned insurgent, turned interim President. These keen experts in Middle Eastern affairs, honed from decades of involvement, confronted the former terrorist with such penetrating questions as: “You’ve been a prisoner, you’ve been a warrior you’ve been a leader and now you’re President, does this not feel very very strange?”.\n\nLooking at al-Sharaa with fawning eyes, the pair legitimised a man who has, in the past week, seemingly permitted the slaughter of thousands of innocent Christians in Syria, whom even Bashar al-Assad had protected from such horrors for many years. These are the podcasters from whom hundreds of thousands still get their political takes.\n\nEveryone is an armchair pundit\n\nWhy does this matter? The proliferation of podcasts, not to mention social media accounts and the general dumbing down of politics into a spectator sport has profound impacts on ministers’ ability to govern, or even understand the fundamental issues. Now that everyone is an armchair pundit, emotions and personalities prevent the chattering political elite from hearing the signal from all the noise.\n\nA cold observer would have seen that inflation under Biden had hurt many millions of Americans, and fears that Democrats cared only about mad progressive issues were far from unfounded. It’s always the economy, stupid. But nebulous nonsense about Harris ‘spreading joy’ prompted motivated reasoning biases and left ‘professional’ pundits stumped.\n\nMore obviously, any idiot could tell you that putting on a suit and reading Why Nations Fail doesn’t make an Islamist into an Oxford PPE graduate.\n\nThe obsession with the media cycle was spotted early by Dominic Cummings, who banned ministers from daily appearances, and tried to wean No 10 off the daily communications ‘grid’, the better to focus on chronic issues that really mattered to voters. Chasing short-term headlines is inimical to good government, to the point that, as Cummings notes, MPs don’t even optimise for winning elections so much as clamouring to get on the Today programme.\n\nI used to adore Rory Stewart’s talk about the need for seriousness in politics. But with his constant praise of Angela Merkel – who is lucky that the bar for worst ever German leader is so high – and his myopia on current affairs, he has been hoist by his own petard\n\nThis lack of grip on chronic issues like productivity, unfiltered mass migration, cultural decay and ballooning debt is because they are not sexy news stories. And a podcast that talked about the same three things over and over wouldn’t get many listeners. I used to adore Rory Stewart’s talk about the need for seriousness in politics. But with his constant praise of Angela Merkel – who is lucky that the bar for worst ever German leader is so high – and his myopia on current affairs, he has been hoist by his own petard.\n\nThe ‘rest’ is not politics (the pun doesn’t even bloody work!). The ‘rest’ is the lives of tens of millions of Brits who are poorly served by a media-obsessed political class hooked on waffle.

Franklin escalated his verbal threats against the employee in December by damaging the carrier's vehicle. FBI agents found photos of the carrier on Franklin's phone, plus two AR-15 style rifles, when they executed search and arrest warrants, the department said.\n\n“Violent, hate-filled attacks against federal employees and residents of the Middle District of Georgia will not be tolerated,” C. Shanelle Booker, acting U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Georgia, said in the announcement.\n\nMan threatened, attacked latter carrier over several months\n\nThe Justice Department became aware of Franklin's actions toward the carrier after the United States Postal Inspection Service received a complaint about Franklin possibly committing threats and obstruction against the employee. Neither the Justice Department nor USPIS named the carrier or detailed the carrier's race.\n\nThe carrier shared a recording of a confrontation between him and Franklin on June 11, 2024, when they argued about whether the carrier's USPS vehicle should be moved.\n\n\"Franklin was recorded using racial slurs against the letter carrier and stated that his free speech was protected,\" the department said. \"The letter carrier was recorded stating that if he was off duty, such statements and threats would lead to a fight.\"\n\nThe carrier declined to fight with Franklin out of fear he'd lose his job. Franklin then became more aggressive against the employee and used \"more salacious racist slurs about him and the community where he lives,\" prosecutors said. Franklin later threatened to punch the carrier, run him over with his tractor and call someone to bring a rope so he could drag the carrier away, the employee told investigators.\n\nAn unnamed family member of Franklin's confirmed getting a call for the rope, prosecutors said.\n\nThe Georgia man escalated his tirade against the carrier on Dec. 3 by hitting the carrier's vehicle with his green tractor. The postal employee told the USPIS and Washington County Sheriff's Office he pulled over for the tractor to pass him, but the driver instead hit the vehicle, destroyed a stop sign and fled the scene.\n\n\"The tractor was registered to Franklin,\" the Justice Department said. \"In addition, two witnesses reported seeing a vehicle registered to Franklin’s wife come to the area immediately following the incident at a high rate of speed.\"\n\nLaw enforcement executed search and arrest warrants for Franklin in December, where they found two AR-15 styled guns in his truck and a loaded pistol that he was carrying. Authorities also found a picture of the postal employee on Franklin's phone, plus evidence supporting the crimes were motivated by the employee's race, court papers said.\n\nThe jury found Franklin guilty of obstructing the mail, assault of a federal officer, aggravated assault of a federal officer and retaliating against a witness, according to court records. He was also found guilty of hate crime enhancements on the two federal officer assault charges and retaliating against a witness.\n\nHe's expected to be sentenced June 5, according to court papers. He faces a maximum six-month sentence for obstructing mail and a maximum of 20 years for the rest of the crimes.\n\n“The safety and security of postal employees is core to the mission of the Postal Inspection Service,” said Jessica L. Wagner, Acting Inspector in Charge of the United States Postal Inspection Service, Atlanta Division.\n\nAttacks on postal employees a problem\n\nFranklin's attack on the carrier is the latest in a string of crimes people are accused of committing against postal employees. Last March, the USPIS found that they made 73% more arrests for carrier robberies over the same time period as the prior fiscal year.\n\n\"This increase is the direct result of the efforts made by the Postal Inspection Service and federal and local law enforcement partners to aggressively pursue those who rob our letter carriers and steal mail. Since May 2023, the Postal Inspection Service has made over 1,200 arrests for letter carrier robberies and mail theft nationwide.\"\n\nIn February, a Michigan man was found guilty of assault when he attacked a postal worker because of her race, the Justice Department said. Russell Valleau was convicted by a jury of assaulting a federal employee after he received a Black person's mail in his mailbox. The Detroit Free Press, part of the USA TODAY Network, said Valleau was angry over receiving mail from Kamala Harris's campaign. The carrier, a Black woman, tried to diffuse the situation but Valleau attempted to attack her through the passenger window.\n\nWhen arrested, the department said Valleau called the carrier an anti-Black slur several times, at one point being told by police to watch his language. He still faces charges in Michigan for ethnic intimidation and misdemeanor assault and battery.\n\nIn January, a woman was arrested after police said she fatally stabbed a postal employee inside of a Harlem deli. A deli worker said the employee, Ray Hodges, was ordering a sandwich when Jaia Cruz argued with him over who was first in line to order. New York City Police arrested Cruz for first-degree murder.\n\nContact reporter Krystal Nurse at knurse@USATODAY.com.

Bush ahead of the 2008 election when he ran with Barack Obama. \n\nThe authors posit that whether Harris won or lost, ‘she would only harm him by publicly distancing herself from him.’\n\nBiden’s staffers remained with the Harris campaign, making it even more difficult to publicly refute the president. \n\nSean Clegg, a Harris advisor not trusted by the Biden staffers, was helping her prepare for a joint appearance with Walz when she started listing things that she and Biden accomplished when he stopped her. \n\n‘Wait, wait, wait! Let’s not do this. Let’s not go down memory lane,’ he said, according to an excerpt published by The Hill.\n\nClegg was reportedly disinvited from future media prep sessions by longtime Dem communications staffer Stephanie Cutter. \n\nHarris aides previously claimed that the Biden team was deliberately not working with them as a result of the president being forced to drop out..\n\nPreviously, Biden was blamed by senior Harris advisor David Plouffe, but for refusing to drop out earlier in the race after his June debate disaster.\n\nPlouffe claimed no Democratic candidate could have won without a proper primary process—what he called ‘the cardinal sin’ of this race.\n\nAnd he said he was shocked by the internal polling numbers when he finally joined the team after Joe Biden dropped out with less than four months to go, a situation he described as ‘catastrophic.’\n\n‘When I got in, it was the first time I saw the actual numbers under the hood. They were pretty gruesome,’ he told The Atlantic.\n\n‘The Sun Belt was worse than the Blue Wall, but the Blue Wall was bad. And, demographically, young voters across the board—Hispanic voters, Black voters, Asian voters—were in really terrible shape. \n\n‘When the switch happened, some of that stuff got a little bit better, but nowhere near where we ended up or where we needed to be. This was a rescue mission. \n\n‘It was catastrophic in terms of where it was.’ \n\nBiden finally bowed to pressure from allies and stood aside on July 21.\n\nThe party quickly coalesced around his vice president to become the candidate, avoiding a drawn out contest that some feared would divide Democrats and hand the election to Trump but to no avail.\n\n‘I’m not sure, given the headwinds, any Democrat could have won,’ said Plouffe. \n\n‘But if we had a primary in which a bunch of people ran and auditioned … through that process, whoever emerged … would have been a more fully formed person, would have had more time to mount a general election campaign. \n\n‘[Not having that process] is the cardinal sin.’\n\nAnd then they had to condense a campaign down into a little more than 100 days. \n\n‘Our first week, it was like, “Well, we need a biography ad, we need to talk about the border, we need to lay out an economic contrast, we need to get health care in there, abortion,'” Plouffe said. \n\n‘If you have six, seven, eight months, you storyboard all this stuff, you have a narrative arc. Everything was smashed and collided here.’\n\nBiden and Harris’ teams blamed each other for wasting over $1 billion in donor cash on a disastrous presidential campaign. \n\nVice Presidential flop Tim Walz blamed himself and Harris for the Democrats ‘ ‘mess’ after their losses at the top of the ticket in November. \n\nWalz and Harris lost every single swing state to Trump, leading to an electoral college blowout, becoming the first Democrat ticket to lose the popular vote since 2004 and just the second since 1988.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nJoe Biden simply told Kamala Harris &#8216;no daylight, kid&#8217; as she prepared for her&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Biden&#8217;s brief advice to Kamala Harris that stopped her from blaming the elderly president right before her initial debate with Trump first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/bidens-brief-advice-to-kamala-harris-that-stopped-her-from-blaming-the-elderly-president-right-before-her-initial-debate-with-trump/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/rewrite-this-title-Bidens-three-word-warning-to-Kamala-Harris.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-14 00:13:03","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.434},{"id":299961620,"title":"Esmond Birnie: T​he economic impact of Donald Trump's return as US president looks dire for both Northern Ireland and America","text":"In the real world, the actual choice for American president in November 2024, at least in terms of economic (il-) literacy was very uninspiring. Donald Trump, the Republican Party candidate, repeatedly said that for him tariffs were an object of beauty – a seeming cure all for every economic ill. (Notwithstanding the well evidenced consensus view in economics that tariffs are a bad thing in general, they damage both the country applying the tariff and those countries on the receiving end). Kamala Harris, the Democratic Party candidate, made some very strange comments that seemed to imply that greedy grocery shops were the main cause of inflation (what about the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the creation of money through Quantitative Easing?). My argument is that Trump’s second presidency will have a range of economic impacts on Northern Ireland and the UK. Most of these are negative and some could be very negative: • (very negative) Tariffs reduce Northern Ireland and UK sales to USA. • (negative) Strong arming by Trump may reduce US investment flows (FDI – foreign direct investment) into NI. • (extremely negative) Trump’s up-ending of collective security and alignment with Russia makes a People’s Republic of China grab for Taiwan more likely. Given that Taiwan makes 60-90% of the world’s most advanced semiconductors and the presence of so much global shipping lanes through the South China Sea, any such invasion would have an economic impact many times bigger than the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Quite apart from the horrible human cost, it would be a horrendous shock to the supply side. • The tax implications of rising to Trump’s challenge to raise defence spending in Europe. • Possibly the only economic ‘positive’ from a Trump White House could be if he leads to a rolling back of possibly excessive ‘DEI’ (Diversity, Equality and Inclusion) activity in the USA. That could in turn leads to a reduction in DEI over-reach in the UK (as argued by Pamela Dow, former Cabinet Office Civil Servant, in a recent, November 2024 article in the New Statesman magazine, what the UK has certainly seen in recent decades is a relatively rapid growth in Human Resources employment and it is rather unclear how much benefit this has really generated). Looking at the tariff impact in more detail. Here’s an estimation for Northern Ireland: 1. Assume a 20% tariff is applied by the US against NI (UK) goods. 2. Assume NI prices in the US market go up by 20% (ie no reduction in profits by NI firms and no depreciation of £ compared to $). 3. Assume an elasticity of demand (based on an average of various studies) -0.4. 4. This all then implies demand in the USA drops by 8%. 5. Using Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA) data (December 2024 with some estimation), NI sale of goods to the USA annually is about £1.3bn, 8% of that is therefore about £100m. 6. By implication NI sales and hence output would drop by about £100m, but this is a direct and narrow estimation of the overall impact. Would such a drop be a big or a small impact? It is ‘only’ about 0.2% of Northern Ireland overall GDP which is about £50 billion. However, if NI’s growth in GDP this year is well under 1% (and this sort of out-turn is quite likely) that would be equivalent to a quarter of overall economic growth. Also, very importantly (and various estimates at the UK-wide level, such as the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, bear this out) 0.2% is probably too narrow an estimate. Allowing for second or third round effects could push up the overall effect two or three-fold. So, a Trump tariff cost of maybe about £200m-300m annually. This is because we allow for the possibility of retaliation against the US tariffs and the impact of a general reduction in the growth rate of world trade. The fiscal policy aspect of increased defence spending in the UK in the Trump era is also an interesting matter. There will be the undoubted challenge of finding ways to fund such spending. So far international development aid has been reduced but next time it may have to be spending on welfare for working age people (that particular budget line has continued to grow even after the Covid pandemic is over). On the more positive side of the assessment, we are beginning to see ‘military Keynesianism’. As in the 1930s government spending on re-armament is acting as a boost to the economy. Some particular Northern Ireland-based manufacturers have or will benefit from this. Not just Thales but Harland & Wolff (the presence of the immense dry dock in Belfast takes on a strategic value) and also smaller firm such as Denroy Plastics. The latter has been making plastic components for Typhoon jets. In summary then, the overall economic impact of Trump second time round looks rather dire. Both for us and also for America.

She later criticized Columbia faculty for staying silent on Khalil’s arrest, calling their response “shameful behavior.” \n\nKhalil has been accused of being a “Hamas sympathizer who espouses violent, anti-American views,” with the Columbia University Apartheid Divest (CUAD) student organization — which he served as a senior activist in — calling for the “total eradication of Western civilization.”\n\nSeveral videos have since been released showing violent disruptive campus activities purportedly led by Khalil.\n\nIn one clip, Khalil can be seen dressed in a hoodie featuring Hamas spokesperson Abu Obaida, urging protesters to “destroy” and “explode the heads of Zionists.”\n\nOn Monday, a judge temporarily halted Khalil’s deportation in defiance of the Trump administration, which says his activism broke the law.\n\nHirsi was previously suspended from Barnard, a liberal arts college affiliated with Columbia University, for her involvement with the unauthorized “Gaza Solidarity Encampment” that was later dismantled by officers with the NYPD. In response, her mother, Somalia-born Democrat Rep. Ilhan Omar (MN), stated she was “enormously proud” of her daughter.\n\nThe matter comes as Omar, notorious for her antisemitic sentiments, continues to push for Mahmoud Khalil’s immediate release. \n\n“We will not let this administration trample our constitutional rights and silence voices they don’t like,” she wrote.\n\nIn August, Omar touted the power of her district’s massive radical pro-Palestinian “uncommitted” movement, which urged voters to reject Democrats who do not back anti-Israel policies, as she called for a “policy shift” on Israel and Gaza amid her fears of another Trump presidency. \n\nShe warned then-Vice President Kamala Harris that refusal to capitulate to the movement could cost Democrats the election.\n\nOmar, a member of the progressive “Squad” in Congress, has a history of controversy. \n\nShe has been accused repeatedly of being antisemitic and anti-American, including in past statements accusing Israel of being an “apartheid regime” that has “hypnotized the world” and claiming pro-Israel stances of politicians are “all about the Benjamins.”\n\nShe has also referred to the terror attacks of September 11, 2001, as a day in which “some people did something.”\n\nIn 2023, then-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) insisted Omar is “unfit” to represent the U.S. on the House Foreign Affairs Committee.\n\nRep.
