The source said the topic of the gubernatorial race is dominating many of the conversations she is having simply because of the fast-approaching 2026 match-up. \n\nEither way, the sources say Harris is sticking to a self-imposed end-of-summer deadline in deciding whether to wade into the already-crowded governor’s race, where the contest includes former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and former California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, who was also a member of the Biden administration as secretary of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe former vice president is planning to take some time off in July, when sources say she hopes to further reflect on the next step in her political career. \n\nHarris’s office did not comment for this story.\n\nIn recent weeks, Harris has been participating in a string of conversations about the political climate in the state and the issues on the minds of Californians, the sources say. She has been particularly interested in the issues facing younger voters and has been holding lengthy discussions about the future of artificial intelligence (AI). \n\nHarris has kept a relatively low profile in recent months after a devastating loss in the 2024 presidential election a race she thought she could win. While California has been in the headlines for a rash of news events, including the protests over Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids in Los Angeles earlier this month and the wildfires that ravaged major swaths of the state in January, the extent of Harris’s public involvement has been posts on social platform X. \n\n“Los Angeles is my home,” Harris wrote in a statement earlier this month on the protests. “And like so many Americans, I am appalled at what we are witnessing on the streets of our city. Deploying the National Guard is a dangerous escalation meant to provoke chaos.” \n\n“In addition to the recent ICE raids in Southern California and across our nation, it is part of the Trump administration’s cruel, calculated agenda to spread panic and division,” she added. \n\nThose close to the former vice president say she has been appalled by the Trump administration’s bold moves, like deploying the National Guard. Harris has told confidants that she feels the president is governing by loyalty and retribution and that such actions will propel her to reenter public service. \n\n“This moment almost requires her to do it,” one source close to Harris said. \n\nAt the same time, if she chooses to enter the race, her confidants know she will have to contend with looming narratives about whether she helped conceal former President Biden’s decline, something Republicans continue to press her on.\n\nEven one of her would-be opponents, Villaraigosa, has made it a talking point.\n\n“Voters deserve to know the truth, what did Kamala Harris and Xavier Becerra know, when did they know it, and most importantly, why didn’t either of them speak out? This cover up directly led to a second Donald Trump term,” Villaraigosa wrote in a post on X last month that took aim at two potential rivals.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of these questions, there’s a thought among some Democrats that a run for governor would be “a consolation prize” with Harris having been close to winning the presidency less than a year ago. Her confidants cringe at that sentiment, and they say Harris brushes off such commentary.\n\nA decision by Harris to run for governor would be significant, political observers say, because it could take a 2028 presidential run off the table. \n\n“I don’t think she could, with a straight face, run for governor in 2026 without making an absolute pledge that she would not run for president in 2028,” said Garry South, a California-based Democratic strategist.\n\nAn Emerson College poll in April revealed that 50 percent of Democratic voters in California would support Harris in a gubernatorial run. A separate survey from Politico/UC Berkeley Citrin Center also released in April revealed that 33 percent of Democratic voters in California would be “joyful” about a Harris bid and 41 percent would be “mostly excited.” \n\nThough those polls show she would be the clear front-runner in the race, some Democrats say they don’t think that’s enough for her to maintain a clear field.\n\n“She would start out, at least initially, as the front-runner. There’s no doubt about it because she has 100 percent name ID in California,” South said. “I think there are real mixed feelings about her among California Democrats, and I think those mixed feelings would grow if she actually got into the race.” \n\n“She doesn’t come into this as an 800-pound gorilla,” he added.\n\nEven as some close to her say she’s leaning toward running, some former aides and longtime observers in the state say they doubt Harris will run for governor because she has been, as one former aide put it, “absent” from the events that have dominated the state. \n\nIn the face of this month’s protests in Los Angeles, for example, Harris was in the Hamptons attending the wedding of Huma Abedin and Alex Soros two big names within Democratic circles. In April, Harris spoke at a gala before hundreds of donors in San Francisco and made no mention of state issues or political affairs. \n\n“She’s the kind of person that if she’s going to do something, she’s very serious about it, focused on it,” said Elizabeth Ashford, a California-based communications adviser who served as Harris’s chief of staff when she was the state’s attorney general. “It just seems to me that this would be a summer of reintroducing herself as a Californian to Californians if that were really front of mind.”\n\nIn the months since she left office, Harris has made most of her public appearances outside of California. \n\nLast month, the former vice president spoke at a closed-room real estate conference in Australia following a surprise Met Gala appearance in New York. She was in Las Vegas for a conference on AI in March and engaged with students at a Maryland community college in December. \n\nHer loss of the presidency in November raises questions for some California Democrats about how she will address the issue they say Democratic voters in the state care most about.\n\n“I think California Democrats right now want somebody who’s going to get in Trump’s face,” said South, the California-based Democratic strategist. “But I’m not sure that someone who just lost pretty badly to Donald Trump can posit themselves as the best counter against Donald Trump if they were to be governor of California.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nKamala Harris is leaning toward entering the California gubernatorial race, sources familiar&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Kamala Harris Considers Running in California Governor&#8217;s Race first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/kamala-harris-considers-running-in-california-governors-race/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/rewrite-this-title-Kamala-Harris-gives-California-governors-race-a.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-23 00:13:32","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.191},{"id":334126110,"title":"Australia Backs US Military Action on Iran Nuclear Sites, Confirms Wong","text":"Support Our Cause\n\nSupport Our Cause\n\n Search for:\n\n HomeNewsAUAustralia Backs US Military Action on Iran Nuclear Sites, Confirms Wong\n\nAustralia Backs US Military Action on Iran Nuclear Sites, Confirms Wong\n\n \n\n Up next \n\n \n\n \n\nKamala Harris Considers Running in California Governor’s Race\n\n Published on 23 June 2025\n\n Internewscast \n\nShare this @internewscast.com\nFacebookXRedditPinterest\n\nForeign Minister Penny Wong has expressed the government’s backing for the United States’ military actions against Iran’s nuclear sites.\n\nIn her statements this morning on Today, Wong indicated that the United States specifically targeted locations pertinent to Iran’s nuclear activities.\n\n“We support action to prevent Iran getting a nuclear weapon,” Wong said.\n\n“We are aware of the UN nuclear watchdog’s reports … indicating that Iran is refining uranium to near-military grade levels … sufficient for producing multiple nuclear arms.”\n\nDonald Trump confirmed the US strikes on Iran on Sunday.(Maxar Technologies)\n\nWong also noted the difficult situation of thousands of Australians who remain stranded in both Israel and Iran, affirming that Australia continues its efforts to assist in their evacuation.\n\n“Obviously, this is a highly risky and precarious situation, and my heart goes out to Australians in Iran and in Israel, and to their friends and families in Australia who are so deeply worried about them,” Wong said.\n\nThe security situation in Israel meant land crossing were not possible, but the government was working on trying to arrange contingency flights, Wong said.\n\n“There are reports … of airspace opening for Israel for a limited period.

Like Bush said in Iraq, ‘We’re going to eliminate the threat. We’re going to find weapons of mass destruction and eliminate them.’ Did that work the way he planned? No, obviously it didn’t,” said Tallwhiteman. The 30-year-old driver for a food distribution company said he usually votes Libertarian, but backed Democrat Kamala Harris over Trump last year.\n\nAcross the U.S. on Sunday, Americans expressed a mixture of support, apprehension and confoundment at the bombings, which officials said caused severe damage to Iran’s nuclear sites. Administration officials said the strikes left room for Iran to return to negotiations over its nuclear program. Yet if the conflict spirals, it could test Trump’s foreign diplomacy skills and also his support at home.\n\n‘It had to be done’\n\nB-2 bombers that participated in the weekend strikes returned home to Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri on Sunday. Nearby, retired Air Force veteran Ken Slabaugh said he was “100% supportive” of Trump’s decision and the military personnel who carried it out.\n\nSlabaugh said Iran has showed resistance to negotiations over its nuclear program for decades, a problem that he said Trump inherited. Iran can’t be trusted, Slabaugh said, nor allowed to acquire nuclear weapons.\n\n“It simply had to be done,” he said of the strikes, adding that he’s now concerned for members of the military around the world.\n\n“I’m proud of the guys and the gals that are doing the work out there. Nobody in the world does this like we do, and we have the freedom and liberty we enjoy because of that,” Slabaugh said.\n\nIn Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, Andrew Williams, 18, said he was surprised by the timing of the attack given that many Republicans had expressed opposition to U.S. involvement in the Israel-Iran war. Still, he thought it was necessary if Iran was building nuclear weapons.\n\n“If we are able to get rid of that, that is something we should do,” Williams said.\n\nRobert Wallette of Billings said Trump had “good reason” to conduct the bombing as a demonstration of American support for Israel.\n\n“Iran’s evil, evil people. They hate Americans,” he said.\n\nConcern about conflict spinning out of control\n\nWallette, 69, a retired contract specialist at the federal Indian Health Service, said he hated Trump when the Republican was first elected because of his arrogant style.\n\nHis perspective started to shift after Trump moved the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. In 2024, Wallette voted for Trump based on his promises to curb illegal immigration, putting him among the 60% of voters backing Trump last year in Yellowstone County, which includes Billings.\n\nNotwithstanding his support, Wallette was unsure if Trump can avoid the U.S. getting drawn into a deeper conflict with Iran.\n\n“Other countries are getting involved and this may be out of his control,” he said.\n\nKent Berame, 32, of Davie, Florida, said it was a little outrageous for Trump to go rogue and approve the attack without explicit support from Congress. He said he doesn’t agree with the United States supporting Israel’s recent attacks on Iran.\n\n“There’s concern that we’re putting troops in danger,” said Berame, a Democrat who owns his own marketing company. “And obviously there’s a retaliatory response toward all of our bases over there.”\n\nBerame said it’s frustrating that the U.S. might be increasing hostilities with Iran just a few years after finally ending the war in Afghanistan.\n\n“I don’t want to see any U.S. soldiers in harm’s way or in danger,” he said.\n\nBack in Billings, Trump voter Patty Ellman said she worries about the U.S. getting sucked into another extended conflict. \n\n“We have enough going on in America to get into other countries’ wars. Let’s just take care of us right now,” she said.\n\nEllman, a 61-year-old who stepped in as caregiver for her ex-husband after he suffered a stroke, said the U.S. should retaliate if attacked, but otherwise stay out of Iran’s conflict with other countries.\n\n“That’s their business,” she said. “We need to worry about Americans and how we’re going to survive and are we going to have Social Security.”\n\nWith contributions from David Fischer in Davie, Florida; Nicholas Ingram in Knob Noster, Missouri; and Mingson Lau in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nBILLINGS, Mont. – Layton Tallwhiteman vividly remembers his early childhood when, in&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: American Reactions to US Strikes on Iran: Concerns Mixed with Support for Israel first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/american-reactions-to-us-strikes-on-iran-concerns-mixed-with-support-for-israel/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Americans-react-to-US-strikes-on-Iran-with-worry-as.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-22 23:35:41","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.05},{"id":334102338,"title":"Trump's Iran bombing leaves 2028 Democrats ducking for cover with muted response","text":"Trump's Iran bombing leaves 2028 Democrats ducking for cover with muted response\n\nOne Democratic governor lauded the goal of taking out Iranian nukes \n\nBy VICTORIA CHURCHILL, U.S. POLITICAL REPORTER IN WASHINGTON, D.C.\n\nPublished: 22:16 BST, 22 June 2025 | Updated: 22:17 BST, 22 June 2025\n\nUnlike their congressional counterparts, the top Democrats with eyes on the White House did not rush to condemn President Donald Trump's Saturday evening strike on Iranian nuclear sites.\n\nSome opted to say nothing at all.\n\nPotential 2028 Democrat presidential hopefuls California Governor Gavin Newsom, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz all shared similar responses to Trump's actions in Iran via social media posts.\n\nAll three Democrats noted that they were monitoring the situations in their states, keeping alert for any potential signs of retaliatory attacks.\n\nNewsom wrote that 'California’s State Threat Assessment Center is actively monitoring for any potential impacts in California.

The Office of Personnel Management tracks when political appointees transition to career positions—a process often referred to as “burrowing in” to the bureaucracy—and Samantha Goldstein did so in 2023.\n\nGoldstein went from senior counsel at the Office of Legal Policy in the Department of Justice to attorney-advisor at the Office of Legal Counsel in the DOJ. \n\nOPM approved her move on Jan. 15, 2023. Goldstein received a pay bump from $110,460 annually to $127,942 annually. \n\nAccording to her LinkedIn profile, Goldstein left the DOJ in July 2024 to serve as deputy legal advisor on Biden’s National Security Council until February, when she joined the Department of Defense as associate deputy general counsel. \n\nGoldstein graduated magna cum laude from Harvard Law School in 2013, and clerked for two U.S. appeals courts: the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals and the District of Columbia Court of Appeals. She interned with the left-leaning NAACP Legal Defense Fund in 2016 and served as a special counsel for Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., in 2018. Between these two positions and before she joined the Justice Department, Goldstein worked at the firm O’Melveny & Myers. Legistorm confirms this history.\n\nDuring her second stint at O’Melveny, Goldstein wrote a Washington Post op-ed with Walter Dellinger, a partner at O’Melveny who had worked in the Clinton administration. (Trump fired Dellinger’s son Hampton, who had served as the special counsel in the Office of Special Counsel, earlier this year, sparking a legal battle.) In that op-ed, Goldstein and Dellinger insisted that Trump is “unfit to hold office.”\n\n“In the face of an unprecedented attack on American democracy by a hostile foreign power, Donald Trump and those who worked for him both as a candidate and a president failed to defend the United States,” they wrote regarding Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report into accusations of collusion between Trump and Russia. “For this alone, he is unfit to hold office.”\n\nGolstein and Dellinger wrote that the Mueller report “demonstrates that the president and his closest aides violated … fundamental duties imposed by their oaths of office,” namely the duty to protect and defend the Constitution “against all enemies foreign and domestic.” \n\nDeep State Opposition\n\nA recent poll found that a whopping 75% of Washington, D.C.-based federal employees making $75,000 or more per year who voted for Democrat presidential nominee Kamala Harris in November said they would not follow a lawful Trump order if they considered it bad policy.\n\nWhile some political appointees who took “career” positions may faithfully work for the U.S. government under any president, this poll suggests that some staff inside the federal government may work against the goals of the current president, in this case Donald Trump.\n\nFurthermore, a recent Foundation for Government Accountability study found that Democrat employees outnumber Republican employees by a 2-to-1 margin across federal agencies. In the 2024 presidential election, 84% of the money that federal employees gave in political contributions went to Harris.\n\nFederal workers enjoy workplace protections that make them very difficult to fire. The new administration is seeking to reform these rules to enable the president to fulfill his duties as head of the executive branch without facing opposition from hostile bureaucrats.\n\nGoldstein did not respond to a request for comment from The Daily Signal by publication time.

Progressives demanded unified opposition before President Trump announced U.S. strikes against Tehran's nuclear program, but party leaders were treading more cautiously. U.S. leaders of all stripes have found common ground for two decades on the position that Iran could not be allowed to obtain a nuclear weapon. The longtime U.S. foe has supported groups that have killed Americans across the Mideast and threatened to destroy Israel. But Trump’s announcement Saturday that the U.S. had struck three nuclear sites could become the Democratic Party’s latest schism, just as it was sharply dividing Trump's isolationist “Make America Great Again” base from more hawkish conservatives. Ken Martin, chair of the Democratic National Committee, noted that in January, Trump suggested the U.S. could “measure our success not only by the battles we win, but also by the wars that we end, and perhaps most importantly, the wars we never get into.” “Today, against his own words, the president sent bombers into Iran,” Martin said in a statement. “Americans overwhelmingly do not want to go to war. Americans do not want to risk the safety of our troops abroad.” Sen. Peter Welch, a Vermont Democrat, said the U.S. entering the war in Iran “does not make America more secure.” “This bombing was an act of war that risks retaliation by the Iranian regime,” Welch said in a statement. While progressives in the lead-up to the military action had staked out clear opposition to Trump's potential intervention, the party leadership played the safer ground of insisting on a role for Congress before any use of force. Martin's statement took a similar tack, saying, \"Americans do not want a president who bypasses our constitution and pulls us towards war without Congressional approval. Donald Trump needs to bring his case to Congress immediately.” Virginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine called Trump's actions “horrible judgment\" and said he'd “push for all senators to vote on whether they are for this third idiotic Middle East war.” Many prominent Democrats with 2028 presidential aspirations had been silent on the Israel-Iran war, even before Trump's announcement — underscoring how politically tricky the issue can be for the party. “They are sort of hedging their bets,” said Joel Rubin, a former deputy assistant secretary of State who served under President Obama and is now a strategist on foreign policy. “The beasts of the Democratic Party’s constituencies right now are so hostile to Israel’s war in Gaza that it’s really difficult to come out looking like one would corroborate an unauthorized war that supports Israel without blowback.” Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Fremont) had called Trump's consideration of an attack “a defining moment for our party.” Khanna had introduced legislation with Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) that called on the Republican president to “terminate” the use of U.S. armed forces against Iran unless “explicitly authorized” by a declaration of war from Congress. Khanna used Trump’s campaign arguments of putting American interests first when the congressman spoke to Theo Von, a comedian who has been supportive of the president and is popular among Trump supporters, particularly young men. “That’s going to cost this country a lot of money that should be being spent here at home,” said Khanna, who is said to be among the many Democrats considering seeking the presidential nomination in 2028. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who twice sought the Democratic presidential nomination, had pointed to Trump’s stated goal during his inaugural speech of being known as “a peacemaker and a unifier.” \"Supporting Netanyahu’s war against Iran would be a catastrophic mistake,” Sanders said, referring to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Sanders reintroduced legislation prohibiting the use of federal money for force against Iran, insisted that U.S. military intervention would be unwise and illegal and accused Israel of striking unprovoked. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York signed on to a similar bill from Sanders in 2020, but so far was holding off this time. Some believed the party should stake out a clear antiwar stance. “The leaders of the Democratic Party need to step up and loudly oppose war with Iran and demand a vote in Congress,” said Tommy Vietor, a former Obama aide, on X. The staunch support from the Democratic administration of President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris for Israel’s war against Hamas loomed over the party's White House ticket in 2024, even with the criticism of Israel’s handling of the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip. Trump exploited the divisions to make inroads with Arab American voters and Orthodox Jews on his way back to the White House. Today, the Israel-Iran war is the latest test for a party struggling to repair its coalition before next year’s midterm elections and the quick-to-follow kickoff to the 2028 presidential race. The party will look to bridge the divide between an activist base that is skeptical of foreign interventions and already critical of U.S. support for Israel and more traditional Democrats and independents who make up a sizable, if not always vocal, voting bloc. In a statement after Israel’s first strikes on Iran, Schumer said Israel has a right to defend itself and “the United States’ commitment to Israel’s security and defense must be ironclad as they prepare for Iran’s response.” Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.) said that “the U.S. must continue to stand with Israel, as it has for decades, at this dangerous moment.\" Other Democrats have condemned Israel’s strikes and accused Netanyahu of sabotaging nuclear talks with Iran. They are reminding the public that Trump withdrew in 2018 from a multinational nuclear agreement that limited Tehran’s enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions negotiated during the Obama administration. “Trump created the problem,” Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) posted on X. A Pearson Institute/Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll from September 2024 found that about half of Democrats said the U.S. was being “too supportive” of Israel and about 4 in 10 said its level of support was “about right.” Democrats were more likely than independents and Republicans to say the Israeli government had “a lot” of responsibility for the continuation of the war between Israel and Hamas. About 6 in 10 Democrats and half of Republicans said they felt Iran was an adversary with whom the U.S. was in conflict. Gomez Licon and Beaumont write for the Associated Press.

Despite a spate of recent left-wing violence -- from burning Tesla and Waymo cars by anti-Musk and anti-ICE rioters, to the anti-Semitic killings and fire-bombings, the focus was almost entirely on blaming the Republican Party for the violent surge.\n\nAmanpour claimed that “Another feature of the MAGA decade is an alarming rise in political violence,” but at least noted the attempt on Donald Trump’s own life. Sreenivasan mentioned the killing of the two Israeli Embassy workers in D.C. and the attack on the home of Jewish Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, but left out the anti-Semitic motivations.\n\nMeanwhile, his guest Walter emphasized right-wing domestic terror, complaining that until January 6, “Nobody wanted to talk about the rise of white nationalist violence. Nobody wanted to talk about attacks on synagogues and African Americans and Latinos….”\n\nSreenivasan blamed Republicans for political violence both past and future, turning a couple of deleted X posts by Utah Sen. Mike Lee riffing on the horrific political murder of a Minnesota lawmaker and her husband, into a harbinger of future terror.\n\nSREENIVASAN: ….And I wonder, you know, what is the impact of that kind of rhetoric where that becomes, I guess almost normal? What does that do to overall the climate of political violence?\n\nWalter actually praised Lee for retracting those statements but kept the blame on Republicans for fostering an atmosphere where “violence starts to be normalized,” stating “You don't want progressive policies in your state, you don’t want the Democrats in power, and you're being told for -- from your political leaders that violence is potentially justified.”\n\nOffensively, Sreenivasan wondered why Republicans still had to kill even when they were winning elections.\n\nSREENIVASAN: ....you had a recent Substack that was fascinating. It said, “Why the Right Turns to Violence, Even When it’s Winning.” And you said in there, today's Republicans are at peak power. They control all three branches of the federal government. They've appointed the majority of judges. They've reshaped election laws at the state level. They have the Supreme Court. They have the keys to the Cadillac and can cruise where they want. Why kill?\" So, why are Republicans taking these acts when they have the keys to the Cadillac, as you say?\n\nThe equally obnoxious Walter came up with a discombobulated (and outdated) explanation of why Republicans are murderers, which matched up neatly with the Democratic Party platform.\n\nWALTER: Because they know their power is fragile. They understand that they have lost the popular vote in seven out of the last eight presidential elections. [Fact check: Trump won the popular vote in 2024 against Kamala Harris, making the actual figure seven out of the last nine]....Most Americans, this includes citizens of red states, support stricter gun control laws. Most people in America support the right to choose….\n\nWalter went on to claim that the violence “today is coming overwhelmingly from the far-right,” but then slid right over evidence that more Democrats than Republicans support violent acts to remove their partisan opponents.\n\nSREENIVASAN: You know, there have been some recent survey data about how comfortable people are with political violence. This is according to the Chicago Project on Security and Threats. The most recent survey in May revealed that about 40 percent of Democrats supported the use of force to remove Mr. Trump from the presidency. About 25 percent of Republicans supported the use of the military to stop protests against Mr. Trump's agenda. And that these numbers more than doubled since last fall. What does that say to you?\n\nAfter hearing all that, Walter still blamed the GOP for stirring up violence among the American public, “….The January 6th insurrectionists, they've watched them be pardoned.”","summary":"On Friday’s edition of Amanpour & Co. on PBS, host Christiane Amanpour introduced journalist Hari Sreenivasan’s segment with UC-San Diego professor and self-styled extremism expert Barbara Walter.

Mainstream Democrats are cautious, while critical The staunch support from the Democratic administration of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris for Israel's war against Hamas loomed over the party's White House ticket in 2024, even with the criticism of Israel's handling of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Trump exploited the divisions to make inroads with Arab American voters and Orthodox Jews on his way back to the White House. Today, the Israel-Iran war is the latest test for a party struggling to repair its coalition before next year's midterm elections and the quick-to-follow kickoff to the 2028 presidential race. The party will look to bridge the divide between an activist base that is skeptical of foreign interventions and already critical of U.S. support for Israel and more traditional Democrats and independents who make up a sizable, if not always vocal, voting bloc. In a statement after Israel's first strikes on Iran, Schumer said Israel has a right to defend itself and the United States' commitment to Israel's security and defense must be ironclad as they prepare for Iran's response. Sen. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., said the U.S. must continue to stand with Israel, as it has for decades, at this dangerous moment.

The longtime U.S. foe has supported groups that have killed Americans across the Mideast and threatens to destroy Israel. But Trump’s public flirtation with joining Israel’s offensive against Iran may become the Democratic Party’s latest schism, just as it is sharply dividing Trump’s isolationist “Make America Great Again” base from more hawkish conservatives.\n\nWhile progressives have staked out clear opposition to Trump’s potential actions, the party leadership is playing the safer ground of demanding a role for Congress before Trump could use force against Iran. Many prominent Democrats with 2028 presidential aspirations are staying silent, so far, on the Israel-Iran war.\n\n“They are sort of hedging their bets,” said Joel Rubin, a former deputy assistant secretary of state who served under Democratic President Barack Obama and is now a strategist on foreign policy. “The beasts of the Democratic Party’s constituencies right now are so hostile to Israel’s war in Gaza that it’s really difficult to come out looking like one would corroborate an unauthorized war that supports Israel without blowback.”\n\nProgressive Democrats use Trump’s ideas and words\n\nRep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., has called Trump’s consideration of an attack “a defining moment for our party” and has introduced legislation with Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., that calls on the Republican president to “terminate” the use of U.S. armed forces against Iran unless “explicitly authorized” by a declaration of war from Congress.\n\nKhanna used Trump’s own campaign arguments of putting American interests first when the congressman spoke to Theo Von, a comedian who has been supportive of the president and is popular in the “manosphere.”\n\n“That’s going to cost this country a lot of money that should be being spent here at home,” said Khanna, who is said to be among the many Democrats eyeing the party’s 2028 primary.\n\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who twice sought the Democratic presidential nomination, pointed to Trump’s stated goal during his inaugural speech of being known as “a peacemaker and a unifier.”\n\n“Very fine words. Trump should remember them today. Supporting Netanyahu’s war against Iran would be a catastrophic mistake,” Sanders said about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nSanders has reintroduced legislation prohibiting the use of federal money for force against Iran, insisted that U.S. military intervention would be unwise and illegal and accused Israel of striking unprovoked. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York signed on to a similar bill from Sanders in 2020, but he is so far holding off this time.\n\nSome believe the party should stake out a clear anti-war stance as Trump weighs whether to launch a military offensive that is seemingly counter to the anti-interventionism he promised during his 2024 campaign.\n\n“The leaders of the Democratic Party need to step up and loudly oppose war with Iran and demand a vote in Congress,” said Tommy Vietor, a former Obama aide, on X.\n\nMainstream Democrats are cautious, while critical\n\nThe staunch support from the Democratic administration of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris for Israel’s war against Hamas loomed over the party’s White House ticket in 2024, even with the criticism of Israel’s handling of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.

Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., was also cautious in responding to the Israeli action and said “the U.S. must continue to stand with Israel, as it has for decades, at this dangerous moment.”\n\n“It really seems like the Trump and Iran war track is kind of going along like a Formula 1 racetrack, and then the Democrats are in some sort of tricycle or something trying to keep up,” said Ryan Costello, a policy director for the Washington-based National Iranian American Council, which advocates for diplomatic engagement between U.S. and Iran.\n\nOther Democrats have condemned Israel’s strikes and accused Netanyahu of sabotaging nuclear talks with Iran. They are reminding the public that Trump withdrew in 2018 from a nuclear agreement that limited Tehran’s enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions negotiated during the Obama administration.\n\n“Trump created the problem,” said Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., on X. “The single reason Iran was so close to obtaining a nuclear weapon is that Trump destroyed the diplomatic agreement that put major, verifiable constraints on their nuclear program.”\n\nThe progressives’ pushback\n\nA Pearson Institute/Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll from September 2024 found that about half of Democrats said the U.S. was being “too supportive” of Israel and about 4 in 10 said their level support was “about right.” Democrats were more likely than independents and Republicans to say the Israeli government had “a lot” of responsibility for the continuation of the war between Israel and Hamas.\n\nAbout 6 in 10 Democrats and half of Republicans felt Iran was an adversary with whom the U.S. was in conflict.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Yassamin Ansari, an Iranian American from Arizona, said Iranians are unwitting victims in the conflict because there aren’t shelters or infrastructure to protect civilians from targeted missiles as there are in Israel.\n\n“The Iranian people are not the regime, and they should not be punished for its actions,” Ansari posted on X, while criticizing Trump for fomenting fear among the Iranian population. “The Iranian people deserve freedom from the barbaric regime, and Israelis deserve security.”\n\nAssociated Press writers Mary Clare Jalonick and Linley Sanders in Washington contributed to this report","summary":"Trump’s public flirtation with joining Israel’s offensive against Iran may become the Democratic Party’s latest schism.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/06/21/democrats-are-at-odds-over-the-israel-iran-war-as-trump-considers-intervening/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Mideast_Wars_Democrats_36197-1.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-21 23:37:08","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.046},{"id":333857036,"title":"Mark Cuban Turned Down the Offer When Asked to Submit to be Kamala Harris’ Vice President in 2024 Presidential Election: ‘I’m Not Very Good as the Number Two Person’","text":"During a recent appearance on “The Bulwark” podcast, Mark Cuban revealed he was invited to submit himself for consideration to become former Vice President Kamala Harris‘ running mate in the 2024 presidential election.

Then The New York Times’s, er, heart-throbbing excuse for a news item over crown prince Alex’s wedding to corrupt former Hillary Clinton aide and disgraced former Congressman Anthony Weiner’s ex-wife Huma Abedin could probably serve as Exhibit A.\n\nTimes writer Tammy LaGorce spent a whopping 2,010 words trying to twist the union of two of the most notorious people in American politics into some kind of fairy tale. “Alex Soros and Huma Abedin Share Their Love Story and Wedding,” read LaGorce’s cringe headline.\n\nLaGorce then profiled their entire relationship story with so much sensationalist puffery it was enough to jump-start a good retching: “Each knew of the other for years, but it took an intense conversation at a party in 2023 — plus a missed DM, a text chain, many more texts, phone calls and the Doha Forum — to set a dinner date.” What is this, high school? \n\nThe newspaper enthusiastically highlighted the A-list Democrats who were in attendance, including Abedin’s old boss Hillary and her husband former President Bill Clinton. This was particularly awkward, given that The Times and other liberal outlets had refused to report on a cringey photo showing President Clinton officiating Abedin’s previous wedding to Weiner, which was uncannily embarrassing given the juxtaposition of the two remarkably similar, cheating men. Other guests of Alex and Huma included former Vice President Kamala Harris and her husband, Doug Emhoff; Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY). \n\nLaGorce didn’t bother to mention anything about Abedin’s role in her former boss’s egregious email server scandal, the mishandling of classified information, and potential conflict of interest with the Clinton Foundation. And why bother when she was too busy making Abedin out to be a Disney princess awaiting her radical Prince Charming:\n\nFor Saturday’s ceremony, Ms. Abedin, who is now legally Huma Abedin Soros, wore an off-the-shoulder ivory Givenchy gown with a slim belt designed by Sarah Burton. Mr. Soros wore a Dior tuxedo that he mentioned was not new, because his favorite clothes tend to be well-made pieces he has hung onto for years.\n\nLaGorce propagandized that Soros’s “fashion philosophy matches his attitude about waiting to find the perfect woman to marry.”\n\n A match made in hell for sure. MRC Business discovered in previous reports that the Soros machine had given at least $131 million to control and influence over 250 media organizations around the world to spread its radical agenda on abortion, Marxist economics, anti-Americanism, defunding the police, environmental extremism and LGBT fanaticism. Apparently, The Times is currying favor with this media empire by giving Alex some free PR.\n\nMRC Business also just released a new investigation in coordination with the Bongino Report highlighting how the Soros machine under both George and Alex allocated at least a whopping $618,895,617 collectively between 2016 and 2024 toward exploiting the issue of climate change alone to reshape the world into an eco-utopia. \n\nOne thing’s for sure, as The Times nauseatingly implied: Alex seems to have found his de facto Queen of the Soros Empire.

Marcy Kaptur (OH-D) and Rep. Emilia Skye (OH-D), the two most vulnerable Ohio Democrats, narrowly won their districts in 2024. Kaptur’s district went to Trump in the presidential race, while Skyes’s barely went to former Vice President Kamala Harris. \n\nRepublicans may also target Rep. Greg Landsman (D-OH), who represents Cincinnati.\n\nMeanwhile, in Texas, state legislators are considering calling a special legislative session for mid-decade map drawing to gain as many as five additional Republican seats.\n\nIf Republicans are successful, Democrats could require a net gain of 11 seats — up from three — to regain control of the House.\n\nThe districts most at risk fall along the US-Mexico border and went to Trump in the 2024 election, following the broader realignment of the Latino voting block in recent elections. \n\nTwo primary targets for Republicans in Texas are Democratic Reps. Henry Cuellar (D-TX), representing the Rio Grande Valley and parts of San Antonio, and Vincente Gonzales Jr (D-TX), representing Corpus Christi.\n\nRepublicans in both Texas and Ohio hope to shift right-leaning constituents from districts currently held by the GOP into new districts in an effort to tip the scales and make the majority of residents Republican.\n\nHowever, redistricting could become a two-edged sword for Republicans, making GOP members of Congress in swing districts more vulnerable to Democratic challenges.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) earlier this month expressed strong support for talks between Texas Republicans and the White House regarding redistricting in the Lone Star state. \n\nHe said that a redistricting effort could make GOP-held districts more competitive and “open up four to six swing seat opportunities that don’t exist right now for Democrats.\n\n“Be careful what you wish for because you just might get it,” Jeffries said. “And you won’t like the result.”","summary":"Republicans in Ohio and Texas are considering attempts to aggressively remap congressional districts in their respective states in hopes of unseating Democrats during the 2026 midterm elections.  As it stands, Democrats need a net gain of three seats to win control of the House of Representatives next year, raising the stakes for President Donald Trump [&#8230;]","url":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/politics/3449916/republican-efforts-redraw-house-maps-protect-gop-majority/","image":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/iStock-2165857864-1024x683.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-21 18:46:40","author":"Gabrielle M.

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., on social media over her characterization of why drug prices are so high for Americans compared to the rest of the world. \n\n“Big Pharma companies like Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer charge Americans the highest drug prices in the WORLD while often paying ZERO dollars in federal taxes themselves. Why? Because our tax system is rigged. Now, Republicans want to make it worse. I’m fighting back,” the Massachusetts senator posted on X and linked below it to a CNBC piece about the legislator’s grilling of drug company executives. \n\nThe Shark Tank star who recently left the show after 15 seasons was sharp in his response to the progressive senator.\n\n“No. It’s because PBMs [pharmacy benefit managers] corrupt health care,” he said on X. \n\nPharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs for short, are third-party administrators of drug prescriptions who negotiate between the groups that pay for the drugs, drugmakers, and pharmacies. They have become the target of increasingly bipartisan regulation.\n\n“Big Pharma wishes they could set their own pricing. They don’t. PBMs control formularies and manipulate prices, in exchange for providing pharma access to patients. It’s how they maximize rebate revenue,” Cuban continued.\n\n“In fact, 3 PBMs NEGOTIATE MORE THAN 90% OF REBATES for commercial insurance plans. That’s your area of expertise, and you have done nothing,” the billionaire concluded. \n\nAccording to a 2024 report from the Federal Trade Commission, “the three largest PBMs now manage nearly 80% of all prescriptions filled in the United States.”\n\nThe president’s son, Trump Jr., then jumped into the debate.\n\n“Didn’t think I’d be RTing Mark for a while, but he’s 100% right on this issue,” Trump Jr. said. \n\n“Agreed,” Silicon Valley venture capitalist Joe Lonsdale added. \n\nIn April, Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed into law first of its kind legislation, which banned PBMs from also owning, managing, or controlling pharmacies licensed in the state of Arkansas. \n\n“For far too long, drug middlemen called PBMs have taken advantage of lax regulations to abuse customers, inflate drug prices, and cut off access to critical medications. Not anymore,” Sanders said in a press statement released for the signing. \n\n“Pharmacy benefit managers can still operate in our state; they just can’t continue to mistreat patients and box out other pharmacies,” Sanders added in an op-ed. \n\nThe Pharmaceutical Care Management Association, a trade organization that represents major PBMs, promptly sued the state over the law.\n\n“Our lawsuit aims to protect patients in Arkansas from the implementation of this dangerous, misguided policy. If implemented, the Arkansas legislation mandating forced closures of pharmacies would have a devastating impact on patient access to critical medications and pharmacy services,” the association said in a press statement. \n\nSanders, a Republican who served as White House press secretary during the first Trump administration, attributed the successful passage of the law to the elder Trump holding office now. \n\n“If you’d asked me a year ago if we could change these entrenched interests, I’m not sure I would have thought it possible. But with President [Donald] Trump in office, everything is changing,” the governor explained. \n\nIndeed, the president has promised to “cut out the middlemen,” and he may get his chance if Congress holds steady and includes provisions to regulate PBMs in the budget reconciliation bill. \n\nOne proposed provision would seek to regulate spread pricing, the practice of a PBM charging “payers like Medicaid more than they pay the pharmacy for a medication.”\n\nThe provision would prohibit the ability to claim federal matching funds for spread pricing where “the PBM charges the state or a managed care organization an amount for the dispensing of a drug that exceeds the amount paid to the pharmacies or providers, net of all pricing concessions,” according to the Bipartisan Policy Center.","summary":"Donald Trump Jr. expressed agreement with Kamala Harris supporter Mark Cuban on X yesterday on the issue of combating high drug prices.&#160; Cuban critiqued Sen....

Many prominent Democrats with 2028 presidential aspirations are staying silent, so far, on the Israel-Iran war.\n\n“They are sort of hedging their bets,” said Joel Rubin, a former deputy assistant secretary of state who served under Democratic President Barack Obama and is now a strategist on foreign policy. “The beasts of the Democratic Party’s constituencies right now are so hostile to Israel’s war in Gaza that it’s really difficult to come out looking like one would corroborate an unauthorized war that supports Israel without blowback.”\n\nProgressive Democrats use Trump’s ideas and words\n\nRep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., has called Trump’s consideration of an attack “a defining moment for our party” and has introduced legislation with Rep.

Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., was also cautious in responding to the Israeli action and said “the U.S. must continue to stand with Israel, as it has for decades, at this dangerous moment.” \n\n“It really seems like the Trump and Iran war track is kind of going along like a Formula 1 racetrack, and then the Democrats are in some sort of tricycle or something trying to keep up,” said Ryan Costello, a policy director for the Washington-based National Iranian American Council, which advocates for diplomatic engagement between U.S. and Iran. \n\nOther Democrats have condemned Israel’s strikes and accused Netanyahu of sabotaging nuclear talks with Iran.

In a statement after Israel's first strikes, Schumer said Israel has a right to defend itself and “the United States' commitment to Israel's security and defence must be ironclad as they prepare for Iran's response.” Sen Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., was also cautious in responding to the Israeli action and said “the US must continue to stand with Israel, as it has for decades, at this dangerous moment.\" “It really seems like the Trump and Iran war track is kind of going along like a Formula 1 racetrack, and then the Democrats are in some sort of tricycle or something trying to keep up,” said Ryan Costello, a policy director for the Washington-based National Iranian American Council, which advocates for diplomatic engagement between US and Iran. Other Democrats have condemned Israel's strikes and accused Netanyahu of sabotaging nuclear talks with Iran. They are reminding the public that Trump withdrew in 2018 from a nuclear agreement that limited Tehran's enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions negotiated during the Obama administration. “Trump created the problem,” said Sen Chris Murphy, D-Conn, on X. “The single reason Iran was so close to obtaining a nuclear weapon is that Trump destroyed the diplomatic agreement that put major, verifiable constraints on their nuclear program.” The progressives' pushback A Pearson Institute/Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll from September 2024 found that about half of Democrats said the US was being “too supportive” of Israel and about 4 in 10 said their level support was “about right.” Democrats were more likely than independents and Republicans to say the Israeli government had “a lot” of responsibility for the continuation of the war between Israel and Hamas. About 6 in 10 Democrats and half of Republicans felt Iran was an adversary with whom the US was in conflict. Democratic Rep Yassamin Ansari, an Iranian American from Arizona, said Iranians are unwitting victims in the conflict because there aren't shelters or infrastructure to protect civilians from targeted missiles as there are in Israel. “The Iranian people are not the regime, and they should not be punished for its actions,” Ansari posted on X, while criticizing Trump for fomenting fear among the Iranian population. “The Iranian people deserve freedom from the barbaric regime, and Israelis deserve security.\" (AP) (This is an unedited and auto-generated story from Syndicated News feed, LatestLY Staff may not have modified or edited the content body)","summary":"Get latest articles and stories on World at LatestLY.

While Palantir staunchly denies the allegations, pro-Trump voices are urging the president to be wary of the tech giant.\n\nThe NYT’s report claims the Trump administration is using Palantir’s “Foundry” system — a data analytics program — to gather hundreds of data points on American citizens, citing anonymous government officials.\n\nPalantir said the company received a letter Tuesday from Democratic New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Democratic Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden requesting information in response to the report.\n\nThe letter compared Palantir’s work for the U.S. government to collaborating with Nazi Germany and apartheid South Africa, according to the company.\n\n“To be very clear: Palantir is not building a master database, and Palantir is neither conducting nor enabling mass surveillance of American citizens,” Palantir stated Tuesday, asserting the NYT’s report is speculation “based on fundamental misunderstandings” of its software.\n\nNonetheless, MAGA acolytes are sparring over the company’s work with the Trump administration. “War Room” host Steve Bannon warned that Palantir’s pervasive work across the federal government amounted to a “surveillance state.” Others flagged Palantir’s past work stopping the “far-right” in Europe and its chief executive’s support of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris as potential areas of concern.\n\n Palantir CEO Alex Karp tells CNBC that his company’s software “single-handedly” stopped the “far right” in Europe. pic.twitter.com/xOqj064beH — Thomas Sowell Quotes (@ThomasSowell) June 4, 2025\n\nPalantir’s Foundry is being used in at least four federal agencies, the NYT’s report alleged. It is a tool that allows engineers to monitor data, according to Palantir’s blog. (RELATED: New York Times Contradicts Itself In Attempted RFK Hit Piece)\n\nPresident Donald Trump and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) have prioritized government efficiency and streamlining information sharing.\n\nTrump signed the Eliminating Information Silos executive order in March, which was targeted at enabling agencies to share information with each other. Its purpose is to “[remove] unnecessary barriers to Federal employees accessing Government data and promoting inter-agency data sharing,” according to the order.\n\nThe NYT speculated that Palantir could be integral to that mission.\n\nAdditionally, Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” that passed the House in May included a provision that prohibited U.S. states from regulating AI for the next ten years.\n\nPalantir first blasted the NYT a few days after the report and asserted it does not “unlawfully surveil Americans.”\n\n The recently published article by the New York Times is blatantly untrue. Palantir never collects data to unlawfully surveil Americans, and our Foundry platform employs granular security protections. If the facts were on its side, the New York Times would not have needed to… — Palantir (@PalantirTech) June 3, 2025\n\n“The recently published article by the New York Times is blatantly untrue,” Palantir stated on X. “Palantir never collects data to unlawfully surveil Americans, and our Foundry platform employs granular security protections. If the facts were on its side, the New York Times would not have needed to twist the truth.”\n\nPalantir also said the NYT sells consumer’s personal data, pointing to the publication’s privacy page.\n\n“They hire technical people to exploit and sell your data. Exactly what Palantir does NOT do,” Palantir claimed on X.\n\nAlthough Palantir was recently thrust into the spotlight, its work for the federal government goes back decades.\n\nLeft-wing activists assailed the company over its role with the Trump administration’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), but ICE has used Palantir since at least 2011, according to a DHS award.\n\nThe company’s work with ICE appears to be ramping up under the Trump administration, though.\n\nICE is set to advance a “sole-source contract” to Palantir, according to a 2025 Department of Homeland Security (DHS) notice. Palantir is the only vendor capable of enabling ICE to perform its mission, the document said.\n\nPalantir is also working on ICE’s ImmigrationOS, a platform targeted at identifying illegal aliens and tracking self-deportations, according to DHS documents. ICE awarded Palantir a nearly $30 million contract in April to create the platform to streamline deportations.\n\nThe company is helping ICE find the “physical location of people who are marked for deportation,” according to Palantir Slacks and internal communications reportedly obtained by 404 media.\n\nCNN and WIRED also published reports in April claiming DOGE is using Palantir to assist in constructing a database to help authorities surveil illegal aliens.\n\nThirteen former Palantir employees recently signed a letter in protest, lamenting that the tech behemoth has “grown hostile to diversity, equity, and inclusion.”\n\nPalantir also works with the Department of Defense (DOD), which awarded Palantir USG Inc. — a subsidiary — a $795 million contract in May. Additionally, it was one of the sponsors of the U.S. Army’s 250th birthday parade on June 14.\n\nPalantir has received hundreds of millions in federal grants across agencies over the past 12 months, according to data from USA Spending.\n\nPalantir stated in a 2020 blog post that it is not a “data company” but rather a software corporation. “We do not collect, store, or sell personal data,” the post read.\n\nThe NYT’s allegations prompted a largely negative reaction from MAGA supporters, including Bannon.\n\n“We’re not for the surveillance state,” he said on his “War Room” show. “We’re free men and women. We believe in liberty and freedom.”\n\nOther critics pointed to an interview that Palantir’s Chief Executive, Alex Karp, did with CNBC.\n\nThe outlet interviewed Karp in 2023 in Davos, Switzerland. Karp said one of the company’s platforms, Palantir Gotham (PG), stopped the “far-right” in Europe. (RELATED: Intel Agencies Begin Dismantling DEI In Response To Trump’s Order)\n\n“Look, we built PG which single-handedly stopped the rise of the far-right in Europe,” Karp said. “We built Foundry, which was just, it was used to distribute the COVID vaccine and saved millions of lives globally.”\n\nLike tech billionaires Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg, Karp has pushed back against wokeness.\n\nHe slammed woke ideology in 2024, calling it a “form of a thin pagan religion,” according to footage. He criticized Democrats at the Reagan National Defense Forum in 2024, saying that Americans, “do not want to hear your woke pagan ideology,” according to a clip on X.\n\nKarp is also outspokenly pro-Israel, and he flew the board of his company to the country in January 2024. Moreover, Palantir supplied Israel with tools after the Hamas attacks on Oct. 7, 2023, according to Bloomberg.\n\nPalantir skeptics in MAGA, however, have pointed to Karp’s past statements on Trump.\n\nKarp donated $360,000 to Biden and supported former Vice President Kamala Harris, he told the NYT in a 2024 interview. He told NYT that he pushed back against Theil’s support of Trump during the first presidential campaign.\n\n“Because Peter had supported Mr. Trump, it was actually harder to get things done,” Karp told the outlet.\n\nHe previously criticized Trump and his immigration stances in 2015, according to videos obtained by Buzzfeed in 2017. In a 2024 Bloomberg interview, he defended Palantir’s work for ICE and said he supports “a fair but rigorous immigration policy.”\n\nHe also told the outlet that he “[agrees] with progressives on most issues.”\n\n The Times seeks the facts and the truth. Our article is based on excellent, factual reporting, including conversations with Palantir employees and federal officials who have knowledge of Palantir’s business before the U.S. government. https://t.co/nHTD6hoP0K — NYTimes Communications (@NYTimesPR) June 3, 2025\n\nAnother point of contention was Palantir’s work for the Biden administration during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Biden administration announced in 2023 that it secured commitments from eight companies, including Palantir, to advance the “trustworthy” development of AI technology, according to a press release.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control (CDC) awarded Palantir a $443 million “consolidated disease surveillance contract” in 2022, FedScoop reported.\n\nPalantir worked with the federal government in 2021 to help distribute the COVID-19 vaccine, according to a company press release.\n\nIt built the platform “Tiberius” for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to “track vaccine production, distribution, and administration across the United States,” the release noted.\n\nBiden also deployed Palantir to aid the CDC in “disease tracking” during the COVID-19 pandemic, The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) originally reported in 2020.\n\nPalantir has been intertwined with the most secretive parts of the U.S. government since its inception.\n\nIt was created in the aftermath of Sept. 11, 2001, and was initially funded by the Central Intelligence Agency’s (CIA) venture capital arm, In-Q-Tel, according to The Financial Times. Palantir’s customers have included the CIA, National Security Agency (NSA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), according to a 2013 Forbes report.\n\nThe NSA’s relationship with Palantir reportedly ended, according to Buzzfeed in 2017.\n\nPalantir’s name is derived from the “palantiri,” or the all-seeing stones that the wizard Saruman used for surveillance in J.R.R. Tolkien’s “Lord of the Rings.”\n\nThe company was created by billionaire Peter Thiel, who supported both Trump and Vice President JD Vance, the latter of whom has known Thiel since 2011, according to an op-ed Vance wrote in 2020.\n\nThe other co-founders include Karp, Joe Lonsdale, Nathan Gettings and Stephen Cohen. (RELATED: Trump 2.0 Takes Chainsaw To The Deep State With Historic Cuts Of Staff, Budgets)\n\nKarp and Thiel are both members of the Bilderberg Group’s steering committee, according to the organization’s website.\n\nThe Bilderberg Group holds annual invite-only meetings with industry and world leaders. Their June 2025 meeting in Sweden highlighted “AI, Deterrence and National Security” as well as “Depopulation and Migration.”\n\n“Palantir is here to disrupt and make the institutions we partner with the very best in the world and, when it’s necessary, to scare enemies and on occasion kill them,” Karp said in a quarterly February earnings call, according to Sherwood News.\n\nTayte Christensen contributed to this report.","summary":"'Palantir is here to disrupt and make the institutions we partner with the very best in the world'","url":"https://dailycaller.com/2025/06/21/palantir-alex-karp-maga-surveillance-nyt-steve-bannon/","image":"https://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2195022246-scaled-e1750191248243.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-21 17:04:27","author":"Eireann van Natta","authors":["Eireann van Natta"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.086},{"id":334027598,"title":"Democrats Are at Odds Over the Israel-Iran War as Trump Considers Intervening","text":"After nearly two years of stark divisions over the war in Gaza and support for Israel, Democrats are now finding themselves at odds over U.S. policy toward Iran as progressives demand unified opposition to President Donald Trump's consideration of a strike against Tehran's nuclear program while party leaders tread more cautiously.\n\nU.S. leaders of all stripes have found common ground for two decades on the position that Iran cannot be allowed to obtain a nuclear weapon.

Progressives demanded unified opposition before President Donald Trump announced U.S. strikes against Tehran’s nuclear program but party leaders were treading more cautiously. \n\nU.S. leaders of all stripes have found common ground for two decades on the position that Iran could not be allowed to obtain a nuclear weapon. The longtime U.S. foe has supported groups that have killed Americans across the Mideast and threatened to destroy Israel. But Trump’s announcement Saturday that the U.S. had struck three nuclear sites could become the Democratic Party’s latest schism, just as it was sharply dividing Trump’s isolationist “Make America Great Again” base from more hawkish conservatives.\n\nKen Martin, chair of the Democratic National Committee, noted that in January, Trump suggested the U.S. could “measure our success not only by the battles we win, but also by the wars that we end, and perhaps most importantly, the wars we never get into.” \n\n“Today, against his own words, the president sent bombers into Iran,” Martin said in a statement. “Americans overwhelmingly do not want to go to war. Americans do not want to risk the safety of our troops abroad.” \n\nSen. Peter Welch, a Vermont Democrat, said the U.S. entering the war in Iran “does not make America more secure.” \n\n“This bombing was an act of war that risks retaliation by the Iranian regime,” Welch said in a statement. \n\nWhile progressives in the lead-up to the military action had staked out clear opposition to Trump’s potential intervention, the party leadership played the safer ground of insisting on a role for Congress before any use of force. \n\nMartin’s statement took a similar tact, stating, “Americans do not want a president who bypasses our constitution and pulls us towards war without Congressional approval. Donald Trump needs to bring his case to Congress immediately.”\n\nVirginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine called Trump’s actions, “Horrible judgement” and said he’d “push for all senators to vote on whether they are for this third idiotic Middle East war.” \n\nMany prominent Democrats with 2028 presidential aspirations had been silent on the Israel-Iran war, even before Trump’s announcement — underscoring how politically tricky the issue can be for the party. \n\n“They are sort of hedging their bets,” said Joel Rubin, a former deputy assistant secretary of state who served under Democratic President Barack Obama and is now a strategist on foreign policy. “The beasts of the Democratic Party’s constituencies right now are so hostile to Israel’s war in Gaza that it’s really difficult to come out looking like one would corroborate an unauthorized war that supports Israel without blowback.”\n\nProgressive Democrats also are using Trump’s ideas and words\n\nRep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., had called Trump’s consideration of an attack “a defining moment for our party.” Khanna had introduced legislation with Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., that called on the Republican president to “terminate” the use of U.S. armed forces against Iran unless “explicitly authorized” by a declaration of war from Congress. \n\nKhanna used Trump’s own campaign arguments of putting American interests first when the congressman spoke to Theo Von, a comedian who has been supportive of the president and is popular in the so-called “manosphere” of male Trump supporters. \n\n“That’s going to cost this country a lot of money that should be being spent here at home,” said Khanna, who is said to be among the many Democrats eyeing the party’s 2028 primary.\n\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who twice sought the Democratic presidential nomination, had pointed to Trump’s stated goal during his inaugural speech of being known as “a peacemaker and a unifier.”\n\n“Supporting Netanyahu’s war against Iran would be a catastrophic mistake,” Sanders said about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nSanders reintroduced legislation prohibiting the use of federal money for force against Iran, insisted that U.S. military intervention would be unwise and illegal and accused Israel of striking unprovoked.

One of life’s small cruelties is that when one acts responsibly and strongly, as Trump has here, they tend not to get credit for the bad things that don’t happen. But we should make an exception for the miracle of the Rio Grande. LIBERAL NEWS OUTLET MOCKED FOR REPORTING ON ‘MYSTERIOUS’ DROP IN FENTANYL FLOWING ACROSS BORDER What there can be absolutely no doubt about is that, somewhere this weekend at a cookout or a bowling alley, there are people enjoying their friends and family who would not be here but for Trump’s border actions. The numbers are simply stunning, almost to the point of Monty Python-level absurdity. In May of 2024, 62,000 illegal migrants were released into the U.S. Last month that number was zero, zilch, nada. Likewise, back when Grandpa Joe Biden was running the show, there were often over 10,000 encounters a day on the southern border, but last Sunday, there were a total of 95, the lowest number ever recorded over 24 hours. To put this in perspective, you could put 95 people in two Waffle House restaurants with room at the counter to spare. It is fair to say that this remarkable closing of the open wound that was flooding our nation with millions of illegal migrants as well as fentanyl and targets of terrorist watchlists, is among the most complete and swiftest handlings of a crisis in American history. If Kamala Harris was in office today, a million illegals could have come in by now. How many gang members? How many rapists? How many deadly doses of fentanyl? Let us not forget how vociferously we were informed that what Trump has done, shutting down the border, was absolutely impossible without acts of Congress. In the giant gumball machine of lies told by the Biden administration, this was among the most stale. It goes back even further than Biden’s incompetence. While Trump had surely tamped down illegal immigration in his first term, before that, Barack Obama, George W. Bush, and Bill Clinton, had all failed to get a handle on the situation. Part of the problem years ago, and still an issue in Trump’s deportation policies, is that some industries, like farming and hospitality, rely heavily on illegal labor. But given that there are already 10-20 million illegals in America, thanks to Biden, we certainly don’t need any more. And the ongoing deportations, which polling consistently shows voters approve of, also play a role in securing the southern border. When one sees people being arrested for jumping the turnstile, it makes them less likely to try it themselves. Deportations turn off the magnet that attracts migrants, and by ending the disastrous catch-and-release policy, Trump has freed our border agents, to actually enforce border security instead of being desk clerks at the Hotel America. According to the Center for Immigration Studies, fentanyl seizures at the southern border are down 50% since November. A huge part of the reason for this is that without the cover of 100,000 illegal migrants a day, smuggling drugs gets much, much harder. Less fentanyl coming into the country means fewer Americans dying of overdoses, a result that surely everyone should cheer.

We certainly are not used to it, but we would be wise not to take it for granted. With the border closed, a million people self-deporting and violent criminals being taken off the streets and out of the country, there will be fewer grieving parents with children lost to violence, fewer grieving children with parents lost to illegal driving.

This is not an accident, it is increasingly by design.\n\nOn Tuesday the decriminalisation of abortion up to birth amendment to the Crime and Policing Bill laid down by Labour Gower MP Tonia Antoniazzi won by 379 to 137.\n\nOf this 291 Labour MPs voted in favour and just 25 against while 63 Lib Dems were in favour and just two against.\n\nOn the other side 92 Tory MPs voted against and just four in favour. Another four abstained by voting in both lobbies. No Reform MPs supported and four voted against.\n\nThe split is not as stark on Friday’s assisted dying vote but nevertheless reveals a trend.\n\nKim Leadbeater’s bill had the support of 224 fellow Labour MPs with 160 against and 56 Lib Dems with 15 against.\n\nOn the other side the Tories split 92 against to 20 in favour while Reform were three against and two in favour.\n\nKemi Badenoch put a two line whip on the abortion vote rather than allowing a completely free vote. This indicated a party position without the threat of disciplinary action which would come with a three line whip. But, remarkably, after the abortion vote senior Tories were complaining that Ms Badenoch had not withdrawn the whip of the four MPs who voted for decriminalisation.\n\nThe last time the UK saw Parliament vote on such seismic social change was back in 1967 with Liberal MP David Steel’s abortion legislation and Labour MP Leo Abse’s Sexual Offences Act which decriminalised homosexuality.\n\nIn both those cases parties split down the middle on conscience votes which saw the odd alliance of rightwing Tory MP Enoch Powell and leftwing Labour MP Tony Benn coming together to support legalising homosexuality.\n\nThe erosion of the conscience vote in the UK has actually come more from a hardening of positions from progressive leftwing parties in Britain and exacerbated by the so-called culture wars.\n\nIn 2012 Ed Miliband imposed a three-line whip on gay marriage on Labour MPs. LGBTQ+ matters ended there as something of individual conscience for the first time. \n\nThen in 2019 former MP Roger Godsiff was dropped as a Labour candidate for supporting parents in his Birmingham constituency who were protesting over primary school children being taught about same-sex relationships.\n\nThis year we see Reform UK banning LGBTQ+ flags from county halls where they have taken control of the council and attempting to purge councils of diversity, equity and inclusion officers and policies.\n\nWhile abortion officially remained a matter of conscience a comment by the now home secretary Yvette Cooper in 2017 about Jacob Rees-Mogg being unfit to be a party leader because of his views on abortion was enlightening.\n\nWhat has happened over a number of years is that the majority of socially conservative, mostly Catholic tradition in Labour has been removed through selection processes.\n\nAn ongoing legal case involving the Liberal Democrats and one of its former candidates has highlighted an apparent major shift in British politics to the party politicisation of conscience issues.\n\nFormer BBC journalist David Campanale was kicked out as the candidate for Sutton ahead of the last election because, he claims, of his Christian beliefs. \n\nAccording to documents presented in the case, Luke Taylor, who replaced him as the candidate, is alleged to have claimed that “the party of past prominent Liberal Democrats with Christian beliefs, such as Shirley Williams and Charles Kennedy, was ‘over’, and that he and others were building a ‘secular party’ which would have no place for Christians expecting to “hold to their religious or conscientious opinions”.\n\nMr Taylor was the teller for the votes in favour of the abortion amendment on Tuesday, who also described the assisted dying vote, which he supported, as a good way to “neatly bookend the week.”\n\nIf Mr Campanale wins his case it will for the first time provide evidence that selection is taking place on conscience issues as well as other matters.\n\nThe Lib Dems have denied the claims and pointed out that their leader Sr Ed Davey goes to church. But the Christian Lib Dems including former deputy leader Simon Hughes have voiced concerns and the party has been condemned by two bishops. and a former Archbishop of Canterbury. Added to that Tim Farron, who voted against abortion and assisted dying last week, was ousted as leader over his Christian beliefs in 2017.\n\nDuring the assisted dying vote a number of supporters of the bill suggested that religious belief had no place in deciding such issues. A real departure from conscience.\n\nBut a brand of conservatism is emerging in the UK which openly embraces traditional Christian values.\n\nReflecting on the assisted dying vote, Tory MP Danny Kruger, a leading opponent of the bill, said: “If we are to withstand our enemies, bring our society together, and tame the technium (somehow ensure that human values govern the new age of machines), we are going to need values that are up to the job. \n\n“I don't think humanist atheism or progressive liberalism or whatever the new religion should be called, is up to it. Christianity is. Only Christianity is.”\n\nIn America, the conscience vote rapidly became more party-politicised as a result of the Roe vs Wade abortion ruling in in 1973. Social conservatives gradually began to take over the Republicans on the right and social progressives the Democrats.\n\nIt has played out ferociously in the selection of Supreme Court justices, who recently in effect overturned Roe v Wade with a conservative majority.\n\nThe most interesting US development is the way that a man like Donald Trump, previously ambiguous over abortion, has adopted a strong anti-abortion line to please his base.\n\nThis played out in the 2022 midterms to the detriment of the Republicans with the Democrats using the threat to abortion rights to great effect. But it did little to help Kamala Harris in 2024.\n\nWhat that shows though is that parties with very strong views one way or the other can be elected largely on economic grounds but bring with them a great deal of baggage on conscience issues. After this week some would argue the same thing has happened in the opposite direction in the UK.","summary":"Votes on abortion and assisted death suggest the UK is on the cusp of a major shift - issues once determined by MPs’ individual conscience are becoming American-style party political matters, political editor David Maddox writes","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/assisted-dying-vote-dignitas-mps-b2774368.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/20/14/97db884c5bf44f448377eb6d2eb19fbfY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzUwNDMzMDg1-2.80710980.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/LP8WZ7EN-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-06-21 13:51:37","author":"David Maddox","authors":["David Maddox"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.006},{"id":333782754,"title":"How the Zohran Mamdani Campaign Is Changing Influencer Culture","text":"If elections were decided by the internet’s views on sex appeal, New York Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani would already be living in Gracie Mansion.

To make things more complicated, popular New York influencers have been criticized for years for promoting a fictional version of the city, one that prioritizes ease for transplants while ignoring the ongoing struggle of working class residents. Now, their comment sections are filled with demands for them to speak out about the mayoral race. As the Trump administration continues to make decisions that are shaking the foundations of America’s democracy, people online are turning to things they can still change — like the New York mayoral election — and expanding the current understanding of influencer expectations in the process. \n\n Learning from Democrats’ mistakes \n\n If there was a lesson to take from former Vice President Kamala Harris’ loss to Trump in the 2024 presidential election, it’s that social media movements need to be organic to work. Even the short term social media push from Harris’ campaign — which included key collabs and endorsements from dozens of the most popular digital creators, celebrities, and influencers — couldn’t get Harris the votes she needed. But the Mamdani campaign has been heralded by New York voters and viewers alike for his people-first approach to digital marketing. He’s appeared on fan favorite talk shows like Gaydar, Subway Takes, streamed with Twitch star Hasan Piker, even appeared at an MJ Lenderman concert. Videos with influencers, celebs, and those in between are posted side by side with explanations of his platforms and responses to breaking news. When New York comptroller and fellow mayoral candidate Brad Lander was taken into ICE custody this week while escorting a defendant out of immigration court, Mamdani stood alongside Lander’s wife and protested the arrest. \n\n But while Mamdani’s online presence has been celebrated for its diversity, New York influencers have been lambasted for a lack thereof. Last March, a month-long discourse broke out over city-based, largely white influencers being “boring as fuck” — posting the same outfits, expensive dinners, and $10,000-a-month apartments to their followers. Carla Davis, a content creator and native New Yorker covering local New York politics, tells Rolling Stone that there’s been a big “pressure campaign” for NYC influencers to speak on the mayoral race because it’s an election that feels like “lives and the soul of the city” are on the line. And if the girlies have time to post about must-try restaurants or fabulous nights out, why can’t they also post about the election? \n\n “The New York City influencer is a poor representation of this beautifully diverse city,” Davis says. “But unfortunately, it is a mirror of the shifting demographics here, where we’re seeing Black, brown and working class New Yorkers be priced out of their homes and neighborhoods, and entire communities with deep roots and beautiful cultural histories be replaced by more affluent newcomers.” \n\n For Davis, it’s this framework that explains why so many audiences are now directly demanding their favorite New York influencers post: You can use this city as a backdrop, as long as you use your platform to help make it better for the people who live in it. \n\n “It seems like the least that you can do is use your influence for good, and speaking about the election specifically, encouraging your audience to vote should really be the bare minimum,” she says. “This is not just a place I’m passing through, or an era in my life. This is my home.” \n\n Rachel Gaede, a 25-year-old transplant and content creator who lives in Manhattan, has been building an online presence since 2020 and has close to half a million followers on TikTok alone. Her most popular videos revolve around lifestyle content like her family dog Roddis, her sister, and her parents — whom she documented Parent Trap-ing during the 2020 lockdown. (Her parents got remarried in December 2023, an event she celebrated on TikTok.) But several of her recent videos have focused on the mayoral race, including telling her audience how to check their voter registration, canvassing for Mamdami, and advocating for people to leave Cuomo off their ballots entirely. She tells Rolling Stone that while sharing politics online can feel “sticky,” the widespread damage of the Trump administration has made it easier to speak out without getting accused of straying from your lane. \n\n “Sometimes it can get confusing when you post a political video and then a purse haul. But at the same time everything is political now. Father’s Day was literally yesterday and it’s not a political holiday. But it felt political because I’m privileged enough to be a person that didn’t get my dad ripped away from me based on the status of his immigration papers,” Gaede says. “So having [your opinion] mixed in content that’s usually silly or lifestyle is OK, because it’s still helping you reach a larger audience and connect with people that might have not originally come to your page for politics.” \n\n Lifestyle gets political \n\n Lifestyle creators in particular have seen the most movement toward political content this year. Lifestyle can cover everything from dating, drama, entertainment, gossip, fashion, style, and cultural commentary to reaction videos and hotel reviews. It’s also known as “the most lucrative niche online,” according to author and creator Eli Rallo, because there are no bounds. You are your content, so when influencers post to their followers, while clothes or books or Amazon purchases might be available, what they’re really selling is themselves. And with the increasing pressure for influencers to post about the race, it seems that while the definition of lifestyle influencing is widening, people are starting to expect political beliefs in the mix as well. \n\n “With the second Trump presidency, people are having to make a conscious decision as to whether or not they’re going to bring politics into their platform. There’s a very contentious discourse around it,” Rallo says. “But to me, it was an abhorrent idea to be selling myself and my ideas on the internet, but also not platforming things that mattered to me and things that were happening right outside my window.” Rallo has been posting about everything from Broadway to books to Black Lives Matter protests since 2020. But she decided to post about the New York mayoral race because of how much content she makes in the city — and the high transplant audience she could reach with just one video — even though she spends half the year in Texas, where she is registered to vote. \n\n “I’m a Cancer, but I get so emotional,” she says. “I couldn’t imagine sitting here in New York City and not telling you to go vote and what matters to me about this place.” \n\n For many creators, none of the choices seem like good options. Remaining neutral also can’t protect creators from backlash. In early May, Kate Mackz, an influencer and host of the Running Interview Show, dealt with a torrent of backlash after posting a conversation with White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt. Critics accused of betraying the liberal followers she gained by supporting the Harris campaign. Anthony Po, YouTuber and the creator of the Timothee Chalamet lookalike contest, tells Rolling Stone he doesn’t think politics and social media have a one size fits all solution. “The worst thing you can be on the internet, and unfortunately it’s what most people are, is an absolutist. There’s nuance in every conversation and it’s totally a case by case basis,” he says. “But why would we want the [Costco Guys’] political take? If you are the type of person whose media diet would come from watching A.J. and Big Justice’s [Instagram] story, you have bigger issues that you need to come to terms with.” But the Jersey City-based creator hosted a Mamdani lookalike event with the group HotGirls4Zohran — posting the results and amplifying Zohran’s campaign messaging because he felt like it could possibly make a real difference in who showed up to vote — and who decides to post in the future. \n\n “I try to make my content so people have a place to escape. But there’s no negatives to posting Zohran,” Po says. “The only people that stand any right to be upset with me are billionaires and incredibly rich real estate owners in the city. So it’s like, what do I have to lose?” \n\n With Great (And Online) Power \n\n Social media users don’t even have to search Mamdami’s name to see a deluge of social media content about the mayoral candidate. But what’s been surprising about this race is just how many previously apolitical creators have endorsed the candidate outright. Jake Shroeder, a 23-year-old creator based in Brooklyn, posts videos putting personal anecdotes to piano chords. (The most popular? A summer ditty containing the lyrics, “When I drink Sauvignon Blanc I dive into a luscious funk.”) He doesn’t consider his content political, but he can’t deny the sheer power of viewership. Adweek data for cable news brands in May 2025 shows declining viewership for the top channels, with the highest viewership (Fox News) still under 3 million at any given primetime minute. For liberal leaning shows, that number shrinks significantly, around 1 million for MSNBC and 558,000 for CNN. In comparison, Shroeder, who only has 175,000 followers on Tiktok, says he can easily end up with 6 million views or more before the end of a good week. \n\n “The voice of the influencer is underestimated,” Schroeder says. “It’s a lot of power and responsibility but it should be used to make a better world. This world is shitty and needs a lot of actionable change. Instead of a post about losing my AirPods, why not a post [about] voting for Zohran?” \n\n The reason why this New York mayoral race seems to be landing differently online is most likely because influencers are asking for a specific action (voting for Mamdani) rather than general awareness. The New York mayoral election has given this usually vibe-based problem a tangible focus. Influencers don’t have to reinvent political alternatives or even pretend to solve decades long problems. They just have to get people to vote for someone who wants to try. According to city data, only 23 percent of New Yorkers voted in the 2021 mayoral election. Mayor Eric Adams only won the primary by 7,197 votes. These influencers reach millions every single day. And as the lead between Cuomo and Mamdani continues to shrink, many creators believe their posts could get their New York followers to vote — possibly for the first time. \n\n “I have a large transplant audience on my account, and speaking to them has been really important to me, because that’s a huge voter block,” Gaede says. “There are so many people that are in New York and choose to leave their voter registrations in the states where they’ve moved from. So representing the hope and the excitement of this election has been really important to me, because I feel like that’s how you get people to show up.”","summary":"Excitement around the New York City mayoral candidate has creators everywhere rethinking their relationship to politics","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/zohran-mamdani-influencer-culture-1235368766/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/zohran-nyc-mayoral-race-influencers.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-21 13:30:00","author":"Ct Jones,Elisabeth Garber-Paul","authors":["Ct Jones","Elisabeth Garber-Paul"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.095},{"id":333911522,"title":"Mark Cuban Confesses He Refused Kamala Harris’ VP Offer—And The Reason is Hilarious","text":"Billionaire businessman and longtime Shark Tank judge Mark Cuban revealed that he was approached to be Kamala Harris’s running mate during her 2024 presidential campaign. But ultimately, he said no. The startling claim surfaced during an episode of The Bulwark Podcast, where host Tim Miller brought up rumors that Cuban was being vetted for the vice presidency. To many, it sounded like political fan fiction. But Cuban confirmed: the offer was real.\n\nThe tech mogul, who is also the former majority owner of the Dallas Mavericks and founder of Cost Plus Drugs, explained his decision with a characteristic dose of blunt honesty: “The last thing we need is me telling Kamala, the president, ‘No, that’s a dumb idea.’ And I’m not really good at the shaking hands and kissing babies.”\n\nDespite Harris selecting Tim Walz, the Governor of Minnesota, as her running mate, she ended up losing the election to Donald Trump, who has, in turn, been in the news for his proposed “Big Beautiful Bill” and a recent tiff with Elon Musk. Throughout the race, Cuban, who considers himself politically Independent, strongly advocated for Harris.\n\nMark Cuban often shares Harris’ views on TV and social media (especially on X) and doesn’t hold back when arguing with Trump’s supporters. This is probably why Kamala Harris extended the VP offer to him in 2024. \n\nWhy Did Cuban Mark Turn Kamala Harris Down?\n\nCuban, who has toyed with the idea of running for President and is open about his Independent leanings, was quite frank when looking back on the situation. “My personality is completely different than Tim’s. My experiences (…) are completely different. I think I’ve cut through the s–t more directly. I’m not a politician.”\n\n“It would have been awful,” he stressed. He also admitted he’s not cut out to play second fiddle: “I’m not very good as the number two person.” He joked that, due to his personality, he could have been fired within a week of joining as VP.\n\nVP Kamala Harris sits down with Mark Cuban for an interview.\nMark makes MAGA melt down so share it so they get big mad!\n🍿 pic.twitter.com/3pZB6Mv8Ct\n— Art Candee 🍿🥤 (@ArtCandee) October 24, 2024\n\nDespite declining the opportunity, Mark Cuban’s enthusiasm for Kamala Harris was no act. “I really thought she was going to win,” he confessed on the podcast. Being one of her big-name fans from the business scene, Cuban’s backing brought some extra shine to her campaign, even though she didn’t win.\n\nCuban has never held back when speaking his mind about Donald Trump, and his criticism has been loud and clear over the years. He used his platforms to endorse Harris and debunk what he called disinformation propagated by Trump loyalists. Cuban’s outspokenness during the 2024 cycle was perhaps the closest he’s come to a formal role in American politics.\n\nA Businessman, Not a Politician…But Never Say Never!\n\nWhile Cuban insists he’s “not a politician,” this wasn’t the first time his name was floated for office. In June 2020, during an interview with CNN’s David Axelrod, Cuban acknowledged seriously considering running for president as an Independent. He said he had thought about a presidential run a lot at the time, though he backed out due to the political gridlock and media scrutiny.\n\nI miss the old Mark Cuban.

But Iran’s attacks have trended smaller as the war reaches its one-week mark, leading experts to believe its stockpiles and launchers could be diminishing quickly.\n\nUS involvement\n\nIran’s capabilities haven’t been completely destroyed yet, and there are concerns that Israel’s military doesn’t have the weaponry required to destroy Iran’s most hardened nuclear facility, Fordow, which is embedded in the base of a mountain. \n\nPresident Donald Trump said on Wednesday the U.S. would be “the only ones capable of doing it, but that doesn’t mean we are going to be doing it at all.”\n\nHe is weighing whether the U.S. should intervene. In the days and hours before this very operation, the president publicly called for Israel to refrain from carrying it out, arguing that he still wanted to give diplomacy a chance to succeed.\n\nTrump has since downplayed his calls for diplomacy.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt relayed a message on Thursday from the president in which he said he will decide whether or not to join the war “within the next two weeks,” giving time for “a substantial chance of negotiations” to play out.\n\nVarious experts have different opinions on whether the U.S.’s most powerful “bunker-buster” bomb, known as the massive ordnance penetrator, or MOP, would be able to destroy the Fordow facility.\n\nThe 30,000-pound bomb is so heavy it can only be transported for deployment via the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber. No other country has the MOP, which is specifically designed to “accomplish a difficult, complicated mission of reaching and destroying our adversaries’ weapons of mass destruction located in well-protected facilities,” according to an Air Force fact sheet.\n\nIsrael could come up with innovative ways to damage the facility without U.S. support, though it would likely require special forces being there. That type of mission comes with its own set of risks.\n\nIf the nuclear facilities are damaged but not destroyed, Iran could restart the program in the future. The regime, fearing a threat to its existence, could also feel the pressure to make a dash toward a nuclear weapon now.\n\nDirector of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard told lawmakers in March that the intelligence community “continues to assess that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon, and leader Khamenei has not authorized the nuclear weapons program that he suspended in 2003.” She added, “Iran’s enriched uranium stockpile is at its highest levels and is unprecedented for a state without nuclear weapons.”\n\nIf the U.S. gets directly involved, Iran could target U.S. bases in the region, which Iran’s proxies have done more than a hundred times since the outbreak of the broader conflict on Oct. 7, 2023. Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned that if Iran fires at U.S. bases in the region prior to the U.S.’s direct involvement, it would retaliate.\n\nSupreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned on Wednesday that any U.S. involvement in the war would be met with “irreparable damage.”\n\nIran has yet to target a U.S. base, though the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem was damaged. There are roughly 40,000 U.S. troops in the region, within striking distance of Iran.\n\nThree U.S. service members were killed and about 40 were injured in January 2024 in a militia’s drone attack on a military base in northeast Jordan, near the Syrian and Iraqi borders.\n\nRegime change\n\nNetanyahu did not identify the toppling of the Iranian government as a priority of Israel’s operations when they began, but Defense Minister Israel Katz threatened Khamenei on Thursday after an Iranian missile hit the Soroka Medical Center in Beersheba, saying he “absolutely should not continue to exist.”\n\n“The Prime Minister and I have instructed the IDF to increase the intensity of attacks against strategic targets in Iran and against government targets in Tehran in order to remove threats to the State of Israel and undermine the ayatollahs’ regime,” Katz added.\n\nTrump warned on Tuesday that the U.S. knew of his location and was choosing not to assassinate him. The thought of targeting Khamenei would have seemed unthinkable a mere two years ago, but Hamas’s Oct. 7 terrorist attack changed Israel’s war calculations.\n\n“I fully acknowledge it’s uncertain what would come next, but it’s hard to imagine anything worse than the ayatollahs,” John Bolton, Trump’s former national security adviser, told the Washington Examiner. “And certainly if the nuclear program and the ballistic missile program had been effectively destroyed, and the Israelis have already eliminated a fair number of nuclear scientists at that point, it’s much more of an internal Iranian problem than it is a strategic threat to Israel or the Gulf Arab States or the United States, or anybody else.”\n\nIf the regime is overthrown, it’s unclear who will take over governance of the country, which has a population of roughly 90 million, and whether the next leaders will also have nuclear ambitions.\n\nPhil Gordon, who served as former Vice President Kamala Harris’s national security adviser, said on the Foreign Affairs podcast this week: “But, even when you get it done, like with the Taliban or Saddam Hussein in Iraq or Gaddafi in Libya, there is often a moment of ‘It worked, mission accomplished, we got rid of the terror regime,’ and that’s when the problems begin because you create a vacuum, and I would caution in this case, for all of those who have a goal of regime change in mind or think Israel is already on its way to victory, be careful what you wish for. Because I would say in this case, as in all previous cases, the most likely result of a regime change in Iran would not be a liberal, pro-West democracy that doesn’t want nuclear weapons.”\n\nThe concerns laid out by Gordon have been articulated by a bipartisan group of lawmakers who don’t support U.S. involvement in the war.\n\n“At best, it would be a version of the Iranian military, which would also have nationalist hard-line goals, at worst it’d be a vacuum that divides people ethnically, branches of the military, conflict pulls in neighbors, and we’ve seen that so often before, so I would say where the goal of regime change is concerned, be careful what you wish for,” he added. “There’s no guarantee that, especially if it’s gone at the hands of the Israeli military, it gets replaced by something better.”\n\nEven if Khamenei makes it out of the conflict alive, he will come out of it weaker than he’s ever been, and it comes on the heels of the destruction of both the Iranian nuclear program and its proxies, which the regime has poured “tens of billions, maybe hundreds of billions of dollars, over several decades” into, Bolton said.\n\nIn the aftermath of Hamas’s Oct. 7 terrorist attack, Israel has fundamentally changed the Middle East. Israeli forces have decimated Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, while Bashar Assad, an ally of Iran, had his regime toppled in Syria. The U.S. also engaged in a limited war against the Iran-backed, Yemen-based Houthis.\n\nIran had spent decades arming and financially supporting that network of proxies, often referred to as the “Axis of Resistance,” and had leaned on them to attack Israel so it could shield itself from an Israeli response. That is, until last week, when Israel launched its opening salvo in the first direct full-scale military confrontation between them. \n\nIsrael had always been aware of the possibility that Iran’s proxies would attack if it and Iran got into a direct conflict. However, Israel systematically defanged each of them ahead of its decision to go after Iran’s nuclear program, changing the equation.\n\n“In the last 18 months, you’ve seen Israel attain escalation dominance, and let me define what that means. That means the ability of the Israelis to control the pace, the intensity, the focus of their military activities against their three principal adversaries: Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iran,” Aaron David Miller, a former longtime State Department Middle East official, told the Washington Examiner. \n\nTurning battlefield wins into political gains\n\nThe U.S. was pursuing Israel-Saudi normalization in the fall of 2023 before Hamas’s attack derailed those negotiations. About a week before Hamas’s attack, a White House official told reporters that a “basic framework” had been “hammered out,” showing just how close all sides were to implementing a historic deal, only for its collapse.\n\nThe effort for normalization was built upon the first Trump administration’s Abraham Accords, in which Israel and four Arab countries — Sudan, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Morocco — normalized ties.\n\nLast month, Trump outlined his long-term vision for U.S. relations in the Middle East during his first trip to the region since getting inaugurated for his second term, and it included bringing Saudi Arabia into the accords.\n\n“It’s my fervent hope, wish, and even my dream that Saudi Arabia — a place I have such respect for, especially over the last fairly short period of time, what you’ve been able to do — but will soon be joining the Abraham Accords,” Trump said in Riyadh. “I think it’ll be a tremendous tribute to your country, and it will be something that’s really going to be very important for the future of the Middle East.”\n\nOne of the primary hindrances to Saudi Arabia’s entrance into the accords, however, is the issue of Palestinian statehood. Its stance has only hardened during Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza, amid a rising death toll and growing humanitarian concerns.\n\nIn September 2023, less than a month before Hamas’s attack, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said, “We hope it will reach a place that it will ease the life of the Palestinians.” A year later, in September 2024, he gave a speech to the Shura Council, stating, “The kingdom will continue to work diligently toward the establishment of a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital and will not establish diplomatic relations with Israel without this condition being met.” \n\nThe Saudis’ demand for Palestinian statehood to be included in a normalization process is starkly opposed to Netanyahu’s view that statehood would amount to rewarding Hamas’s terrorist attack, the most deadly in Israel’s history.\n\nThe Israelis have not publicly articulated a clear plan for postwar Gaza, even though the war has gone on for roughly 20 months and Hamas has been severely degraded.\n\nTrump has described Gaza as “uninhabitable,” given the level of destruction Israel’s forces inflicted on the enclave. U.S. officials have said it could take more than a decade to complete the reconstruction of Gaza.\n\n“The question is, in the wake of this escalation, dominance, all of these conflicts, is it possible to foresee or envision political arrangements which are at most transactional, maybe partly transformational, I don’t know,” Miller added. “Saudi-Israeli normalization can’t be done without an end to the war in Gaza and a major move by the Israelis on the Palestinians. The Abraham Accords may broaden, but again, not if the war in Gaza continues, and not if there isn’t an alternative political process which gives the Arab states cover for something they’d probably like to do.”\n\nThe lack of a clear plan for Gaza limits the prospects for Israeli-Saudi relations but could be an indication of its view toward Iranian regime change.\n\n“You’ve got Israeli escalation dominance,” Miller continued. “You’ve got America riding that escalation dominance.

Via surfing","text":"What do men want? Democrats need to know after their election drubbing by Donald Trump and the “manosphere” last year. They have responded by commissioning “Speaking with American Men”, a strategic plan that will study “the syntax, language and content that gains attention and virality” in online spaces.\n\nNews of the two-year $20m project reinforced critics’ view that Democrats have become the party of an aloof, college-educated liberal elite whose pursuit of working class men resembles a Victorian explorer wielding a butterfly net. Which makes the publication of David Litt’s book, It’s Only Drowning, a timely contribution to Democrats’ ongoing post-mortem.\n\nLitt is a former senior speechwriter for Barack Obama dubbed “the comic muse for the president” for his work on White House Correspondents’ Association dinner monologues. The 38-year-old has written speeches and jokes for athletes, chief executives and philanthropists and was head writer and producer in the Washington office of the comedy studio Funny or Die.\n\nIt’s Only Drowning, his third book, centres on an improbable friendship that develops between Litt, a Yale-educated liberal with a fear of sharks, and his brother-in-law Matt Kappler, a tattooed truck driver who listens to podcaster Joe Rogan and never registered to vote.\n\nTheir chasmic differences in background, education, ideology and lifestyle initially seem unbridgeable but, when Litt asks Kappler to help him learn how to surf, the shared experience provides neutral ground for connection.\n\n“What started as a surfing book became a story about basically a will-they won’t-they?, except it’s whether an Obama speechwriter and a Joe Rogan superfan can become friends,” Litt says in an interview at the Guardian’s office in Washington. “Like a lot of Democrats, my natural inclination is to be a little annoying and condescending. I certainly wasn’t doing that when I was the one who desperately needed to learn from him.”\n\nLitt, who divides his time between Washington and Asbury Park, New Jersey, describes himself as a high-functioning, high-anxiety person who experienced situational depression during the coronavirus pandemic. He had a feeling of overwhelming dread, difficulty getting out of bed and found himself endlessly doomscrolling.\n\nHis wife Jacqui’s brother, by contrast, seemed to be thriving. Kappler is a guitar player, a motorcycle enthusiast and a daredevil surfer. Litt reflects: “I had always thought of him as a crazy person, and I still do, but he was able to deal with the ups and downs of life in a world that’s on fire in a way that I began to envy.\n\n“He did well during the pandemic and he seemed resilient in a way that, to be totally honest, I didn’t. I definitely was not about to get tattoos or try to drive a truck because I would bump into things, but I could see myself trying to surf and that’s what happened.”\n\nIt would not be easy. At the age of 35, it required developing new muscles and confronting intense fear and humiliation. Still, Litt moved to the Jersey Shore and enlisted Kappler to help with surfing lessons. After months of struggle, he set the ambitious goal of riding a big wave in Hawaii.\n\nSurfing became a metaphor for confronting fear, both physical and existential, and an antidote to Litt’s habitual overthinking. He says: “Weirdly, the feeling I get, that sense of dread when a wave is about to crash down right on top of me, is actually somewhat analogous to the feeling I get when reading the news these days. It’s that sense of looming disaster and there’s nothing you can do about it.”\n\nAnd most importantly, Litt came to consider Kappler a friend. “One of the only things more difficult than learning to surf is making a new friend in your 30s, so I feel like I might be even more proud that I was able to accomplish that than riding an overhead wave on the North Shore.”\n\nAs he tells this story, Litt reflects on America’s deep political and cultural divisions and how they were exacerbated by the pandemic. Differences in taste and lifestyle become “identifiers” declaring political allegiance. Litt admits that, had Kappler been a friend rather than family, he would probably have cut off contact after learning that Kappler refused the Covid shot.\n\n“He played electric guitar in a ska band that is a big deal on the Shore; I played ultimate frisbee. He was into death metal and I was into Stephen Sondheim. So we never had anything in common. In the run up to the pandemic all of these differences weren’t always political but then somehow they started to feel like they were telling us what team we were on. It felt like we’d been drafted into opposite sides of the culture war.”\n\nLitt does not pretend that there was a Hollywood ending in which he and Kappler found common ground and changed each other’s minds. But he does argue in favour of shared activities that allow for connection and understanding between individuals with differing views.\n\n“What we found was this neutral ground. Surfing is a space that is not politically coded and you can talk about something that isn’t one of the gazillion fault lines in our society right now. It’s hard to find those spaces but, for the exact same reason, it’s worth trying.\n\n“I heard from a lot of people in the run-up to this book coming out who said, ‘I have a friend or family member where politics is tearing us apart. We can’t talk about anything in the news and how do I convince them?’ What I would say now is talk about something else. Don’t talk about what’s in the news.\n\n“Start by looking for that neutral ground and forgetting about this idea of common ground, because the reason it feels like we have no common ground is that we don’t. We just disagree on a lot of important things as a society.”\n\nLitt knows that, had Kappler been registered to vote, he would certainly not have done so for Democratic nominee Kamala Harris. Back in 2016, Kappler said he would have backed either Trump or Bernie Sanders because they were the most entertaining.\n\nLitt says: “Truly the biggest divide between us politically is that I think about politics a lot and that’s part of how I define myself. Matt watches the news, he cares about what’s going on in the world, but that’s not his identity. He’s not a political person.\n\n“One of the problems that Democrats have right now is we’re very much the party of news junkies and most Americans are not news junkies.”\n\nCelebrity politics and cultural influence have moved towards Republicans and the likes of Rogan and Elon Musk, who appeal to anti-establishment sentiment and claim to prioritise common sense over political parties. A new generation of rightwing podcasters and influencers started out as entertainers and latched on to issues later.\n\n“Democrats are still lagging.” Litt says. ‘The new media voices that are developing, many of them are great, but they tend to be political first and entertainment second, or politics as entertainment, and so they don’t appeal as much to people who don’t find politics entertaining and those are the voters we’re going to need in ‘28.”\n\nDemocrats also have a well documented class problem. It has come to be seen by many as the party of Hollywood celebrities and college-educated elites, with a whiff of contempt for blue collar workers in the heartland, summed up by Hillary Clinton’s dismissal of half of Trump supporters as a “basket of deplorables.”\n\nThe party’s perceived shift toward identity politics and social justice issues alienated some working class voters who once formed its base. Ahead of the 2016 election, Senator Chuck Schumer declared: “For every blue-collar Democrat we lose in western Pennsylvania, we will pick up two moderate Republicans in the suburbs in Philadelphia.”\n\nIt turned out to be bad maths. Last November Republicans swept the White House and both chambers of Congress. Trump won 56% of voters without a college degree, compared with 42% who favoured Harris, a shift from 2020 when Trump and Joe Biden were roughly even.\n\nLitt points out the homogeneity of Democratic circles and the lack of organic relationships with working-class people, particularly those without college degrees. This disconnect hinders their ability to understand their issues or effectively communicate.\n\nRecalling his time volunteering for Harris’s ill-starred election campaign, he says: “I would sometimes be on conference calls and people would talk about a policy or message and say, ‘Do we think this is going to work? Do we think this is going to be effective?’ I would basically say, well, let me go surfing and find out.\n\n“Nobody else said, ‘Oh, let me go talk to my working class friend,’ because Democrats often do not have working friends who don’t have college degrees. The people who are in office, and the people who work for those who are in office, almost all are college educated and almost all their friends are college educated.\n\n“You have Democrats sit in rooms where literally everyone has a college degree, and they say, how come people without college degrees don’t feel like we’re thinking about them or that we’re welcoming to them? Well, look around the room.”\n\nLitt acknowledges that he is writing about a friendship with one other white man, the smallest possible sample size, making it hard to draw sociological conclusions about working class people of colour.\n\nBut he also notes that Republicans have sought to “repolarise” the country on educational and culture war lines while making race less important in determining how people vote. Polls show that Trump did make big inroads with Latino men and, to a lesser extent, with African American men.\n\nLitt says: “I don’t know that race stopped mattering but I do think there was a Democratic view that race mattered so much more than anything else, especially for people who are not white.\n\n“What we saw is very clearly no, that’s not true and was maybe not the most empirically based attitude to have. The base of the Democratic party is still Black women but I do think there was some some of that racial depolarisation.”\n\nDemocrats do have a strong policy agenda for blue collar workers but have failed to communicate it, Litt argues. His friendship with Kappler will not explain everything. But he offers it as a start for a party that somehow allowed Trump – a millionaire businessman who cuts taxes for the rich – to steal its clothes.\n\n“If you had asked me three years ago, do you have a lot to learn from your brother-in-law, I would have said not really, and one of the things I had to learn was that’s a deeply obnoxious attitude. I’m still a professional Democrat – I can still be plenty annoying – but I think I am less self-righteous than I used to be. And it turns out life is more fun and you’re more persuasive that way.

Those with ties to big donors are wary of whether Martin can lead the party, as some influential DNC members, such as David Hogg, with ties to younger voters and labor unions, have quit.\n\nSince Martin took over, the DNC has drained its cash reserves by $1.8 million, records show. Meanwhile, the RNC’s cash on hand has grown by $27 million during the same period.\n\nThe DNC touted the fundraising numbers on Friday as something to celebrate, announcing it had raised roughly $40 million from individual contributions in the first four months of Martin’s leadership, more than any previous chairman in that time period. \n\n“This is only the start, but it’s a record-setting start that allows Democrats to meaningfully invest in every part of the country,” Martin said in a statement that didn’t address that the DNC has spent more than it has brought in May. “Let’s get back in the game, keep winning races across the ballot, beat the Republicans in Virginia and New Jersey, and then take back Congress in 2026.”\n\nThe fundraising numbers come as the party rebuilds after Kamala Harris and Joe Biden’s 2024 disappointments, and Democrats have begun to criticize Martin’s ability to lay out a vision ahead of the 2026 midterms.\n\nSome DNC members have complained that Martin looks “weak and whiny” in the struggle to contain the several disputes that have spilled into the public.\n\n“My basic feeling is that the DNC right now is a mess. I mean, there’s no question about it,” said Democratic strategist Brad Bannon.\n\nHogg, a former vice chairman for the group, accused Democratic leaders of having a “serious lack of vision” when he ultimately decided not to run for the leadership position after the DNC voted to void his election. \n\nThe Gen-Z activist’s efforts to primary elderly Democrats inflamed the party and ultimately led to a public rebuke from Martin. \n\nMartin also fretted in a leaked audio that Hogg’s actions had limited his ability to focus the party on rebuilding the Democratic Party’s public image.\n\nThen, Randi Weingarten, the influential leader of the American Federation of Teachers, and Lee Saunders, president of the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, both quit the DNC over their disagreement with Martin’s leadership.\n\nBoth leaders, who supported Wisconsin’s Ben Wikler for the DNC chairman, were removed from the powerful Rules and Bylaws Committee by Martin and refused to continue as at-large DNC members. They also complained that Martin’s leadership was not widening the big-tent umbrella coalition the party needs to claw back power. \n\n“While I am a proud Democrat, I appear to be out of step with the leadership you are forging, and I do not want to be the one who keeps questioning why we are not enlarging our tent and actively trying to engage more and more of our community,” Weingarten wrote to Martin on June 5. \n\n“The decision to decline the nomination to the Democratic National Committee was not made lightly,” Saunders said in a statement to the Washington Examiner. “It comes after deep reflection and deliberate conversation about the path forward for our union and the working people we represent.” \n\nMartin, however, will have a new vice chairwoman after Shasti Conrad was elected on Friday, following the reelection of Malcolm Kenyatta as vice chairman, in the aftermath of the Hogg drama, which could help him begin to put his stamp on the DNC.\n\n“As an AAPI leader, I’m proud to represent America’s fastest-growing voting bloc and ensure we have a seat at every table where decisions are made,” said Conrad in a statement on Friday. “I’m ready to work side by side with Chair Martin and Democrats across the country to win elections and live up to the values we all share.”\n\nYet, Democrats are worried that their financial deficit compared to Republicans could hinder their ability to win future elections.\n\nOn Friday, Vice President JD Vance, the RNC finance chairman, traveled to Los Angeles, California. He attended a fundraiser for the organization during its summer retreat, according to an invitation obtained by the Washington Examiner.\n\nThe fundraiser charges $44,300 per photo with Vance and $88,600 per couple for a roundtable and photo with the vice president, another example of how the GOP is adding to its coffers after gaining control of the White House and Congress.\n\n“We have no clear path or plan,” one DNC member told the New York Post. “The midterms are going to come before we know it, and then we’re going to be really f****d.”\n\nInsiders told the New York Times that major donors have been reluctant to give to the DNC this year despite Martin’s solicitation and that party leaders have discussed borrowing money to pay its bills. \n\n“That’s certainly not our plan right now,” Martin told the paper about borrowing funds. “I don’t know if we’ll have to at this point.”\n\nEven Hogg, whose group Leaders We Deserve is investing $20 million in primarying senior Democrats, is facing some financial problems.\n\nThe group raised $848,088 in May, but spent $797,880, and has $1.5 million cash on hand, according to data compiled by Rob Pyers, research director at California Target Book.\n\nOther DNC members acknowledged that money has become a problem now that they are shut out of power.\n\n“The DNC is no different than any other ally groups out there,” said John Verdejo, a North Carolina DNC member. “There’s many ally Democratic-leaning groups right now, starving for money right now since Trump’s election.”\n\n“Big Democratic donors are holding on to their purses right now, just looking to see where things go,” he continued. “And this tends to happen when you’re the losing party. There’s a period where the money’s not flowing as much as it used to.” \n\nAdding to Martin’s problems is that Harris raised a historic $1 billion in just three months of running for president, but reportedly finished the campaign with $20 million in debt, which could deter donors from opening their wallets again.\n\nVerdejo said donors from the last cycle who are keeping up with the barrage of negative press surrounding the DNC may be cautioning Martin “to clean house first” before they cut a check.\n\nIn April, Martin also announced a $1 million monthly investment from the DNC in all 50 state parties to help them rebuild before the 2026 and 2028 elections. However, the program is also adding further strain to the party’s financial resources.\n\n“Martin has to make a case that he’ll make better use of [money] than the previous regime did in 2024 because … I think a lot of donors are gun-shy,” Bannon added.\n\nA recent poll backs up Bannon’s assertion. According to a Reuters-Ipsos poll, 62% of Democrats said it was time for new leadership, with only 24% saying the party should keep current leadership in place.\n\nMany Democrats have pushed the DNC to move away from distracting fights to focus more on fighting Trump’s efforts to muscle through his reconciliation bill, crack down on sanctuary cities, and steamroll Washington.\n\nSunjay Muralitharan, president of the College Democrats of America and a DNC member, described the internal drama as “minor, personality squabbles.”\n\n“Everyone has their own personal opinion of what direction the party should be in. I think everyone is entitled to that opinion,” Muralitharan said. He claimed it would be hard for Martin or any one leader to create the big-tent party structure Democrats have been known for in the past.\n\nMartin’s supporters point to his work traveling to nearly two dozen states and leading the party to victory in flipping red seats during special elections in Nebraska, Wisconsin, Iowa, and Pennsylvania as an example of how effective the chairman has been despite his struggles. \n\nDemocrats also don’t appear keen on pushing out Martin anytime soon.\n\n“I will say it’s too early to say that it’s time for him to step aside. He just got elected in February. It is now June,” said Douglas Wilson, a Democratic strategist in North Carolina. “What I will say, though, is that the party has to figure out a way to stop airing out internal debates in the open.”\n\nPublic leaks will continue to weaken Martin in the eyes of the public and donors, leading to more disastrous problems, the strategist cautioned.\n\n“One, you lose support and the confidence of the base, two, you lose the confidence of the donor class, and then three, the voters feel that you don’t have your house in order,” he continued. “So, how can we put you back in power?”\n\nRon Harris, a Minnesota DNC member and chairman of the DNC Midwestern caucus, claimed that Martin’s past leadership of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party gave him the experience to navigate the complicated problems he faces.\n\n“Having been a party chair for 15 years or so in Minnesota, he’s seen his fair share of internal dynamics leaking to the public,” Harris said. “He’s been on the other end of mean accusations and people trying to throw dirt on his name or get in his way, so he’s more than prepared to sort of navigate this.” \n\nDEMOCRATS BRUSH OFF INTRA-DNC SQUABBLES AS ‘BRUISED EGOS’ AND ‘MINUSCULE’\n\nDemocrats are looking for progress soon. \n\n“I’m willing to give him some leeway so he has time to get his act together, but he better do it soon,” said Bannon. “He better do it quickly, because the Hogg fight was a distraction. The departure of Weingarten and Saunders are great losses. So he better get going and get going fast.”","summary":"Democratic National Committee&#160;Chairman Ken Martin&#8217;s rocky tenure hit another bump with the release of fundraising numbers for the organization, which has struggled to regain its foothold after President&#160;Donald Trump&#8216;s victory in the 2024 election.

However, this perception doesn’t reflect the growing reality in many parts of the country, where political competition at the local level is being replaced by a strong allegiance to a single party.\n\nIn recent years, counties that Republicans were winning by 20 points at the start of the 21st century are now seeing margins of 50 points or greater. Concurrently, the number of counties that switch allegiances between parties during each presidential election cycle has diminished.\n\nAccording to data collected by the NBC News Political Unit, demographic trends have clearly defined our current political groups. Additionally, geographical trends highlight the extent to which this reorganization has concentrated along community lines over the past 25 years. It’s becoming increasingly common for individuals to have political discussions only within their own echo chambers, as the political clustering in the United States has made it more feasible than ever to avoid opposing views. \n\nLooking at blowout county wins\n\nGeorge W. Bush’s Electoral College win in 2000 was famously razor-thin. But his average win across the country’s 3,100-plus counties was about 17 points. Democrats’ advantage in population-dense urban cores bolsters their popular vote count election after election. But Republicans’ advantage in rural counties has been a core part of the Republican playbook, with small-county wins with margins of 50 points or more adding up, bit by bit, to a substantial coalition. These were the counties where each candidate had 50-plus-point-margin wins in the 2000 election:\n\nBush captured major wins across the Plains states and up through the Mountain West, while Al Gore racked up margins of 50-plus points in the densely populated New York City boroughs, Philadelphia, Baltimore and some scattered rural areas with large Black populations.\n\nBut more than two decades later, President Donald Trump has dramatically expanded the number of blowout win counties.\n\nTrump has grown Republican political advantages east of the older GOP bulwarks and has captured Appalachia, which was once a reliably Democratic region, continuing to drive up margins in rural America. The average size of a Trump blowout county was about 10,000 voters last year. On the flip side, Democrats have grown their advantages in population-dense cities and suburbs, with the San Francisco Bay Area; Portland, Oregon; and Seattle emerging on this map as heavily Democratic areas. The average size of a blowout county for Kamala Harris was 210,000 voters. \n\nSome of the most important political coalitions for Democrats emerge on this map, especially in comparison with 2000. The 2024 map shows the birth of Democratic vote powerhouses in majority-Black DeKalb and Clayton counties in Georgia and in Wisconsin’s Dane County, home of Madison and the University of Wisconsin, with its heavily white and college degree-holding population. Both coalitions are essential to Democratic wins in those states in recent elections.\n\nOverall, there are four times as many blowout counties today than there were at the turn of the century.\n\nCounties flipped\n\nOne consequence of the sharp rise in blowout counties: a precipitous decline in swing counties.\n\nBack in the 2004 election, 227 counties flipped from one party to the other compared with the 2000 election. But last fall, only 89 changed their party preferences from the 2020 election.\n\nThe total number of flipped counties has dropped over the century. The biggest spikes occurred in the 2008 first-term election of Barack Obama and the 2016 first-term election of Trump — moments when the party coalitions changed dramatically.\n\nTrump’s 89-county flip in this last election was actually an increase over the 80 counties that flipped in Joe Biden’s victory in 2020. The last election was also statistically notable for another reason: Harris became the first candidate this century who didn’t flip a single county compared with the previous election.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe United States might seem like a nation evenly split between Republican&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: The Impact of Rapidly Expanding ‘Blowout Counties’ on U.S. Politics first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/the-impact-of-rapidly-expanding-blowout-counties-on-u-s-politics/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/What-the-explosive-growth-of-039blowout-counties039-means-for-US.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-21 10:05:40","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.393}]}
