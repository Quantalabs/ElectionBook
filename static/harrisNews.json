We can’t stand you. You’re a shit Vice President.”\n\nTrump added the catchphrase from his bygone television show “The Apprentice” to cheers: “Kamala, you’re fired,” he said. “Get the hell out of here.”\n\nTrump told the crowd that profanity helps him put emphasis on his arguments, but the more pointed attack also underscores a recent heightening of personal invective in a tight race that is in its final weeks. At a rally on Wednesday, he called Harris “a horrible person” and “not a smart person.”\n\nNBC News reached out to the Harris campaign for comment.\n\nHarris, campaigning in Atlanta Saturday, ripped Trump for meandering in his public remarks. “He tends to go off script and ramble and generally for the life of him cannot finish a thought,” she said. “And he has called it the weave. But I think we here call it nonsense.”\n\nTrump spent the first 10 minutes of his roughly 90-minute speech telling stories about Palmer, the late professional golfer for whom the airport was named. At one point, he suggested that Palmer had unusually large genitalia.\n\n“He was strong and tough, and I refuse to say it, but when he took showers with the other pros, they came out of there they said, ‘Oh my God. That’s unbelievable,'” Trump said.\n\nThe Harris campaign quickly pounced on the anecdote. One Harris campaign spokesperson, Sarafina Chitika, suggested that someone should do a “wellness check” on the former president while another, Matt Corridoni, posted on X that Trump was “Having a totally normal one.”\n\nAn NBC News poll earlier this month showed Harris and Trump tied at 48 percent apiece nationally, while state polls in Pennsylvania and other battlegrounds have consistently placed them within the margin of error of each other.\n\nHarris portrayed Trump Saturday as too tired for the job they both seek, a partisan reversal of Republican claims that President Joe Biden is incapacitated. Trump, for his part, called Biden “mentally deficient” Saturday.\n\nBiden dropped out of the race this summer and helped Harris lock down the Democratic nomination with his endorsement after he stumbled badly in a debate against Trump\n\n“Now he’s ducking debates and canceling interviews because of exhaustion,” Harris said. Trump canceled an interview with NBC News’ Senior Business Correspondent Christine Romans that was scheduled to tape on Monday; his campaign said it would reschedule but had not yet done so as of Friday afternoon.\n\nHe also backed down from a CNBC interview and a planned appearance at a National Rifle Association event in recent days.\n\nOn Friday, during an exchange with reporters in Michigan, Harris took a cleaner swing at Trump over his energy level.\n\n“Being president of the United States is probably one of the hardest jobs in the world,” Harris said. “And so, we really do need to ask if he’s exhausted being on the campaign trail, is he fit to do the job?”","summary":"Former President Donald Trump called rival Kamala Harris a &#8220;s&#8212; vice president&#8221;&#8230;","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/trump-insults-harris-by-calling-her-a-terrible-vice-president-amidst-escalating-personal-attacks/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/rewrite-this-title-Trump-calls-Harris-a-s-vice-president-800x430.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-20 00:17:59","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.296},{"id":260350276,"title":"Oasis brothers Noel and Liam Gallagher will be 'kept apart' in 'military style operation' on reunion tour with 'separate dressing rooms and transport' amid long running feud","text":"Kim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSunday, Oct 20th 2024\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLiam didn't want to die, he didn't have to: Star had great plans for future and he should have been saved on the night of his death, says source close to family\n\nOlympic cycling legend Sir Chris Hoy reveals that his cancer is terminal - and he has just 'two to four years left'\n\nNew SNP chief was forced to apologise over sickening post attacking Kate and royals\n\nLauryn Goodman 'reported Kyle Walker's wife Annie Kilner to the police over shocking WhatsApp messages'\n\nAN WILSON: Why Charles should call the bluff of these drongo and ungracious Aussies and announce he'll quit as their head of state, by the late Queen's biographer\n\nLIZ JONES: I so wanted Meghan to be fulfilled.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy Geraint Llewellyn For Mailonline \n Published:01:11 BST, 20 October 2024 |Updated:01:13 BST, 20 October 2024 \n\nOasis brothers Noel and Liam Gallagher will reportedly be kept apart when not on stage in a 'military style operation' during their much-anticipated 2025 reunion tour.\nThe feuding siblings' fractious relationship came to a head in 2009, after a backstage fight in Paris led to Noel, 57, leaving the iconic Britpop band and he and Liam, 52, have been embroiled in a very public feud ever since. \nBut despite managing to put their difference aside to get back on stage, there will be separate dressing rooms and transport to avoid a clash and resulting 'PR and financial nightmare'.\nA source told The Mirror: 'They will not be in each other's pockets and effectively be separate entities that come together for necessary promotional work and the gigs. Other than that they will be apart for much of this reunion.\n'Rehearsals will be the first time that they will be together for a significant amount of time working again. The atmosphere is sure to be electric, but also a little edgy.' \n\nOasis brothers Noel and Liam Gallagher will reportedly be kept apart when not on stage in a 'military style operation' during their much-anticipated 2025 reunion tour.\n\nThe feuding siblings' fractious relationship came to a head in 2009, after a backstage fight in Paris led to Noel, 57, leaving the band and he and Liam \n\nThe brothers have been embroiled in a very public feud ever since (pictured 2008) \nMailOnline have contacted Oasis' reps for comment. \nLiam previously said Noel's now ex-wife Sara MacDonald drove a wedge between himself and his older brother and was to blame for the band being 'no longer'.\nLiam and Sara have long had very public rows - with Liam once labelling Sara a 'dark' person, and labelling her a 'b****' during furious late-night calls.\nBut Sara has often hit back - reportedly once dubbing him a 'deplorable w*****' and saying she hoped he'd 'have dropped dead' by a certain time.\nHe even hinted she was the reason that an Oasis reunion wouldn't be happening, with Noel furious over Liam's name-calling about Sara.\nBut after Noel's £20million divorce from his ex-wife went through last year, the elder Gallagher is said to have been persuaded of the financial merits of getting the band back together.\nNoel and Sara revealed their split in January 2023, after nearly 12 years of marriage.\nIn a statement released to MailOnline at the time, announcing their separation, they said that their two sons 'remain their priority'.\n\nBut despite managing to put their difference aside to get back on stage, there will be separate dressing rooms and transport to avoid a clash and resulting 'PR and financial nightmare' \n\nA source said : 'They will not be in each other's pockets and effectively be separate entities'\n\nLiam previously said Noel's now ex-wife Sara MacDonald drove a wedge between himself and his older brother and was to blame for the band being 'no longer' (Noel and Sara in 2019)\n\nNoel also has a daughter Anais, born in 2000, who he shares with his first ex-wife Meg Matthews. \nMany Oasis fans have already been left empty-handed when the hotly-anticipated 17-date UK reunion tour sold out in a matter of hours in an online fiasco. \nAround 14 million fans faced eight-hour queues in a bid to get their hands on the highly-sought-after tickets to see the rock band live, with many still missing out\n\n Oasis release 'third and final' tour date in Melbourne after Aussie fans struggled to get tickets amid sky-high demand \nWhile some managed to nab tickets, many were forced to splash out huge amounts on them after dynamic pricing saw costs soar to almost double the price in a matter of hours.\nThe Gallagher brothers then made tickets available for another two Wembley shows via a staggered invite-only ballot, but many fans were left disappointed after not being called up for the sale despite queuing for hours in the first sale.\nOasis shot to global stardom in the '90s, with their 1994 debut album Definitely Maybe becoming the fastest-selling debut album in British history.\nThe following year (What's The Story) Morning Glory? was released with smash hits Wonderwall, Don't Look Back In Anger and Champagne Supernova, with Wonderwall topping the ARIA Top 10 charts for 11 weeks in a row following its release.\nDuring their 90s heyday, Oasis visited Australia in 1998 for the Be Here Now Tour after their chart-topping global success.\nThey delighted fans by returning Down Under for the 2001 Heathen Chemistry Tour, and again came back in late 2005 for the Don't Believe the Truth Tour.\nThe band infamously called it quits after a backstage argument at the Rock en Seine festival in Paris in 2009. \n\nShare or comment on this article: \nOasis brothers Noel and Liam Gallagher will be 'kept apart' in 'military style operation' on reunion tour with 'separate dressing rooms and transport' amid long running feud\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nEXCLUSIVELiam Payne was forced to extend his trip to Argentina after his visa application to remain in the US was refused due to drug abuse\n\nStrictly fans left cringing by Wynne Evans and Katya's Jones' 'awkward' return to the dance floor following THAT 'hand incident' \n\nEXCLUSIVELiam Payne 'did not take his own life and could have been saved' says source close to family in bombshell new claim\n\nEXCLUSIVEThe seven-year-old who will inherit Liam Payne's vast fortune: Incredible sum he left Bear is revealed by KATIE HIND \n\nHelen Flanagan 'moves boyfriend Robbie Talbot into family home' amid blossoming romance\n\nLooking to manage your weight more effectively and feel fuller for longer?

Wouldn’t take his phone calls anymore while at the White House, and he went rogue,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “A weak and pathetic ‘bully,’ he’s got nothing going.” But he capped off the run of insults by attacking something Trump truly values: his target’s golf game, just like he did while debating Joe Biden earlier this year. “Really low clubhead speed, a total non-athlete!”\n\nWhile speaking at a rally held in support of Kamala Harris on Thursday, Cuban slammed Trump’s understanding of business. “I’ve learned a lot about business, including how tariffs work,” Cuban said. Trump appears to “thinks that China pays for them,” adding, “This is same guy that thought that Mexico would pay for the wall.”\n\nWith the post, Trump included a clip of vocal supporter and yet another fellow billionaire Elon Musk speaking at a campaign event in support of Trump on Friday. Musk inserted himself into the conversation about Cuban, telling attendees, “I saw an interview with Mark Cuban and, what’s-her-name again, Rachel Maddow… but I couldn’t tell which was which.”\n\nCuban spoke to Maddow on Tuesday about his past dealings with Trump. The pair initially got along well — in 2015, Cuban contemplated being Trump’s vice president during his first presidential campaign. But the relationship soured after Cuban “fairly quickly realized that Trump was was very much not the best thing to happen to politics, and it’s been a very long time since he said anything nice about Trump and his political prospects,” Maddow said.\n\nCuban had no plan to break that streak Tuesday night. He told Maddow, “There’s really no good reason to vote for Donald Trump as the business candidate” and added, “You know, in doing business, whether you’re a small company or very large company, you want stability. You don’t want to wake up one morning as the CEO of John Deere and find out all of the sudden you’ve got a 200% tariff.”\n\nTrump has repeatedly vocalized support for tariffs that could top 60% on goods imported from China. He has argued that the higher import tax will bring increased revenue to the United States and allow him to cut tax rates without inflation rising. The plan has been panned and described as “dangerous.”\n\nApparently offended by Cuban’s continued criticism of him and praise for Harris, Trump also shared a link to a Fox News article from August about a poll Cuban conducted among his followers on X. Cuban asked, “Whose persona and character would you like to see young children grow up to have?” Trump won the poll 68.9% to 31.2% on the Musk-owned platform.","summary":"The GOP candidate calls his former ally a \"weak and pathetic 'bully'\" as the fellow billionaire endorses Harris, also sharing video of Elon Musk comparing Cuban's look to Rachel Maddow\n\n\nThe post Donald Trump Mocks ‘Loser’ Mark Cuban&#8217;s Golf Game: &#8216;Really Low Clubhead Speed, a Total Non-Athlete!&#8217; appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/donald-trump-says-loser-mark-cuban-went-rogue/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/donald-trump-georgia.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-20 00:11:21","author":"Stephanie Kaloi","authors":["Stephanie Kaloi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.109},{"id":260350050,"title":"Cher Endorses Kamala Harris for President: ‘She Is Fighting for All of Us’","text":"Cher has officially announced that she will be voting for Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov.

The former president began by praising Palmer’s career and describing his previous conversations with him.“There were a few golfers that you could say may be slightly better, a few, not many,” he said. “But there was nobody that had his magic.”\n\nBut the former president’s anecdote quickly devolved as he discussed some intimate details about the golfing icon.\n\n“This is a guy that was all man,” Trump said. “He took showers with the other pros, they came out of there, they said, ‘Oh my God, that’s unbelievable.’ I had to say it.”\n\n“I had to tell you the shower part because it’s true,” he added.\n\nSocial media users were quick to mock the former president for the anecdote.\n\n“According to the most recent NYT/Siena poll, the top three issues for swing voters include: 1. Inflation 2. abortion 3. The size of Arnold Palmer’s schlong,” podcast host Dan Pfeiffer wrote on X.\n\n“But don’t call them weird,” author Jennifer Taub posted, alluding to Kamala Harris’s moniker for the former president and his running mate, JD Vance.\n\nOthers commented on the crude nature of the comment.\n\n“Real dinner table stuff,” one X user said.\n\n“Clicked ‘Arnold Palmer’ to see if something was trending about the tea,” another user wrote. “It was the furthest thing from tea.”\n\nPalmer was born in Latrobe in 1929. Nicknamed “The King,” Palmer is one of the most iconic golf players in US history. Palmer diied in 2016 at 87 years old in Pittsburgh.\n\nTrump is leading Harris by just one point in Pennsylvania, the latest Emerson College poll reveals. As Trump discussed Palmer in the key swing state, Harris was campaigning with Usher in Atlanta.

Trump explained during a rally in Pennsylvania Saturday at Arnold Palmer Regional Airport in the golfer's hometown of Latrobe, why his game was physically superior to Palmer's during a round 12 years ago. \"I got to know him when he was 69 years old, and I played pretty much with him, a lot of him,\" said Trump, 78, who was 17 years younger than Palmer. \"And as he got older — you know, when you get older, you start to lose a thing called distance, and I'm a good golfer, not like that, but I'm a good golfer. \"And I felt so good because I was hitting it a little bit longer than Arnold, but he was, by this time, 75, 76, and I'd hit it four, five yards past him. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM \"I said ‘Arnold, let me ask you: Thirty years ago, 40 years ago, was I longer than you?’\" Trump said. Trump's comments about the golf legend didn't stop there. Trump also referred to the former golfer's manhood and how other players reacted to Palmer in the shower. FORMER NFL STAR AND TRUMP SUPPORTER ANTONIO BROWN JOINS VOTER-REGISTRATION EFFORT IN KEY SWING STATE \"He was all man,\" Trump said of Palmer. \"This man was so strong and tough, and I refused to say it, but when he took showers with the other pros, they came out of there; they said, ‘Oh my God, that’s unbelievable.' I had to say it. \"I had to tell you the shower part of it because it's true.\" Palmer was born in Latrobe in 1929 and died in the neighboring city of Pittsburgh in September 2016, just a month and a half before Trump's presidential election win. Pennsylvania was a key swing state in Trump's victory. Palmer was nicknamed \"The King\" of golf and is credited as one of the sport's most influential figures. During Saturday's rally, Trump recalled stories of Palmer's wealth as a fellow business mogul. \"Arnold was a very rich man,\" Trump said after recounting stories about how the former golfer helped finance various businesses. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Trump's event also featured former Steelers stars Antonio Brown and Le'Veon Bell. Brown delivered a speech on behalf of Trump and mocked Trump's opponents, Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. \"Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, did you really know they want to put tampons in the boys' bathroom?\" Brown asked the crowd. \"That's really insane, right?\" A new Fox News survey of Pennsylvania voters has Harris narrowly ahead of Trump by two points (50-48%) among registered voters, and the race is tied at 49% each among likely voters. The July survey, conducted shortly after President Biden dropped out and endorsed Harris, but before she was named the nominee, was deadlocked at 49%. But even in March, when Biden was the presumed nominee, the contest was close to even. Since July, Harris has widened her lead among women (by nine points), non-White voters (plus-eight) and voters under age 30 (plus-17). Her support has held steady among college graduates and urban voters. Ninety-two percent of Harris supporters are certain of their vote versus 86% of Trump supporters. Trump’s most loyal groups include men, Whites without a college degree, independents and rural voters. He has nearly doubled his lead among men and the small group of independents since July.

A quota is one-sixth of the vote or 16.7%.\n\nFor Saturday’s election, the ABC is calling\nten Labor seats, eight Liberals, two Greens, one Independent for Canberra (IfC) and one other independent, with three still undecided. \n\nLabor has won a seventh consecutive term, having governed in the ACT since 2001, often in coalition with the Greens. At the 2022 federal election, the ACT gave Labor a 67–33 two-party win, easily the most pro-Labor jurisdiction. This strong left lean makes it difficult for the Liberals to win ACT elections.\n\nVote shares were 34.5% Labor (down 3.3% since the 2020 election), 33.0% Liberals (down 0.9%), 12.5% Greens (down 1.0%), 8.5% Independents for Canberra (new) and 11.5% for all Others (down 3.3%). Postal votes have not yet been counted, and these should help the Liberals.\n\nNearly all pre-poll votes and some election day votes were cast electronically. Provisional preference distributions for these votes were published on election night, with paper ballots to be added to these electronic votes in the coming days.\n\nAnalysis of each of the five electorates follows. The final seat result will probably be ten Labor (steady since 2020), ten Liberals (up one), three Greens (down three), one IfC (new) and one other independent (up one). If this occurs, Labor and the Greens will retain their combined majority with 13 of the 25 seats.\n\nIn Brindabella, the Liberals won 2.57 quotas, Labor 2.05, the Greens 0.55 and IfC 0.45. Analyst Kevin Bonham says the Liberals are likely to win the last seat after postals are counted.\n\nIn Ginninderra, Labor has 2.26 quotas, the Liberals 1.52, the Greens 0.89 and IfC 0.45. Bonham says the Greens and Liberals easily win the final two seats on the provisional distribution.\n\nIn Kurrajong, Labor has 2.20 quotas, the Liberals 1.41, the Greens 1.07 and IfC 0.83. IfC easily wins the last seat on the provisional distribution.\n\nIn Murrumbidgee, the Liberals have 2.06 quotas, Labor 2.02, independent Fiona Carrick 0.78 and the Greens 0.57. Carrick easily wins the last seat.\n\nIn Yerrabi, the Liberals have 2.19 quotas, Labor 1.86, the Greens 0.71 and IfC 0.58. The Greens easily defeat IfC on the provisional distribution.\n\nHarris dips in polls, but US presidential contest remains tight\n\nThe United States presidential election will be held on November 5. In analyst Nate Silver’s aggregate of national polls, Democrat Kamala Harris leads Republican Donald Trump by 49.1–46.8, a gain for Trump since last Monday, when Harris led by 49.3–46.5. Harris’ national lead peaked on October 2, when she led by 49.4–45.9.\n\nJoe Biden’s final position before his withdrawal as Democratic candidate on July 21 was a national poll deficit against Trump of 45.2–41.2.\n\nThe US president isn’t elected by the national popular vote, but by the Electoral College, in which each state receives electoral votes equal to its federal House seats (population based) and senators (always two). Almost all states award their electoral votes as winner-takes-all, and it takes 270 electoral votes to win (out of 538 total).\n\nRelative to the national popular vote, the Electoral College is biased to Trump, with Harris needing at least a two-point popular vote win to be the narrow Electoral College favourite in Silver’s model.\n\nIn Silver’s state poll aggregates, Harris leads by just 0.4 points in Pennsylvania (19 electoral votes) and Wisconsin (ten). She leads by about one point in Michigan (15 electoral votes) and Nevada (six). Trump leads by 0.8 points in North Carolina (16 electoral votes), 1.4 points in Georgia (16) and 1.8 points in Arizona (11).\n\nIf Harris holds her current leads in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan and Nevada, she likely wins the Electoral College by at least 276–262. But Harris’ margins in these states are now very narrow.\n\nWhile Silver’s model is still effectively a 50–50 toss-up, Trump is now the slight favourite with a 51% chance to win the Electoral College, up from 48% last Monday. Harris’ Electoral College win probability had peaked at 58% on September 27. There’s a 26% chance that Harris wins the popular vote but loses the Electoral College.\n\nWhile Trump was the favourite in Silver’s model between late August and mid-September, this is his first lead in FiveThirtyEight since early August.\n\nSilver said on Friday that current economic conditions imply Harris should win the national popular vote by about one point, so the contest is trending towards this outcome. But Trump would be likely to win the Electoral College with just a one-point Harris advantage in the popular vote.\n\nLiberals lose Pittwater to teal at NSW state byelections\n\nByelections occurred Saturday in the New South Wales state Liberal-held seats of Epping, Hornsby and Pittwater. Labor did not contest any of these byelections. In Pittwater, The Poll Bludger’s projections give teal independent Jacqui Scruby a 54.1–45.9 lead over the Liberals, a 4.8% swing to Scruby since the 2023 state election.\n\nCurrent primary votes are 53.7% Scruby (up 17.3%), 42.4% Liberals (down 2.6%) and 3.9% for a Libertarian. The Greens had won 6.8% in 2023, but did not contest, presumably to stop left-wing votes exhausting under NSW’s optional preferential system.\n\nThe other two byelections were easy Liberal holds, with the Liberals beating the Greens by 61.6–38.4 in Hornsby (58.0–42.0 against Labor in 2023). The Liberals won Epping by 65.8–34.2 against the Greens (54.8–45.2 against Labor in 2023).\n\nFederal Morgan poll and NT redistribution\n\nA national Morgan poll, conducted October 7–13 from a sample of 1,697, had a 50–50 tie, unchanged from the September 30 to October 6 Morgan poll.\n\nPrimary votes were 37.5% Coalition (steady), 30% Labor (down 1.5), 14% Greens (up 1.5), 6% One Nation (up 0.5), 9% independents (steady) and 3.5% others (down 0.5).\n\nThe headline figure uses respondent preferences. By 2022 election preference flows, Labor led by 51–49, a one-point gain for the Coalition.\n\nThe Northern Territory has two federal electorates: Lingiari and Solomon. It had been seven years since the last NT redistribution, so a new redistribution was required, and this was released Friday. \n\nABC election analyst Antony Green said Labor’s margin in Lingiari was increased from 0.9% to 1.7%, but decreased in Solomon from 9.4% to 8.4%. This is a draft redistribution, but there are not expected to be any changes before finalisation.","summary":"The ACT election has yielded yet another Labor win, with the party holding office in the ACT since 2001.","url":"https://theconversation.com/labor-retains-office-at-act-election-us-presidential-election-remains-on-a-knifes-edge-241678","image":"https://images.theconversation.com/files/626766/original/file-20241019-15-20hr00.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=12%2C667%2C8033%2C4016&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-19 23:08:51","author":"Adrian Beaumont,Election Analyst Psephologist at The Conversation; and Honorary Associate,School of Mathematics and Statistics,The University of Melbourne","authors":["Adrian Beaumont","Election Analyst Psephologist at The Conversation; and Honorary Associate","School of Mathematics and Statistics","The University of Melbourne"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"AU","sentiment":0.021},{"id":260347590,"title":"Gov. Tim Walz calls Democratic ticket 'underdog' at Chicago fundraiser, sharpens attacks on Trump-Vance","text":"Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz on Saturday told a packed room of Chicago donors that Democrats are the “underdog” with 17 days until Election Day — as he ramped up his attacks on former President Donald Trump.\n\nThe Minnesota governor flew to Chicago, along with his daughter, Hope, for a nearly three-hour visit to stump before top donors in a packed Park Hyatt Chicago banquet room before heading to another campaign reception in Omaha, Nebraska.\n\nThe reception came ahead of a high-dollar private fundraiser for the Harris Victory Fund — hosted by Gov. JB Pritzker and MK Pritzker — with former President Barack Obama and Wilco frontman Jeff Tweedy on Monday.\n\nMayor Brandon Johnson also plans to travel to Detroit on Sunday to deliver remarks in support of Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign at three historically Black churches.\n\nDitching the more casual plaid garb he’s has been wearing to rallies, Walz, in a blazer, no tie and slacks, on Saturday stressed the importance of winning key battleground states like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan. He vowed that Democrats will win North Carolina.\n\nStill, he told a room full of donors and elected officials: “We’re the underdog.”\n\n“This thing is gonna be close,” Walz said. “That’s the way our country is.”\n\nWalz thanked supporters for funds that are going directly toward supporting campaign efforts in must-win battleground states. And the governor also continued to sharpen his attacks on Trump as he takes on what his campaign has called a “more aggressive” approach to campaigning following his televised debate with Sen. JD Vance, the Republican vice presidential nominee.\n\n“It’s pretty clear the tired, divisive and old rhetoric of Donald Trump matches the tired, divisive and old Donald Trump,” Walz said. “That there is nothing more there. There’s nothing but hate. There’s nothing but division. There is no solution.”\n\nAs Harris and Walz try to reach out to independent and undecided voters in TV, radio and podcast interviews, Trump has backed out of two key interviews this month. Walz accused the former president of hiding.\n\n“Where’s Donald Trump?” Walz said. “Look, she and I are one interview away from being regulars on Fox News.”\n\nWalz appeared on “Fox News Sunday” two weekends in a row, seeking to speak to undecided voters.\n\nThe Democrat on Saturday told supporters that Trump is “unfit, as somebody said, for any office, let alone the presidency.”\n\n“He’s unfit for the goodness of what this country can be,” Walz said. But the option is he is not going to be president of the United States.”\n\nIllinois Democratic power players met Walz when he arrived at O’Hare Airport, including Johnson, Sen. Dick Durbin, U.S. Reps. Danny Davis, Bill Foster, Robin Kelly, Jan Schakowsky and state Comptroller Susana Mendoza.\n\nBesides the greeters, former Education Secretary Arne Duncan was among supporters spotted at the fundraiser.\n\nWalz is traveling to Michigan, Massachusetts, Connecticut and New York through Monday. The campaign also announced that Harris will join former GOP Rep. Liz Cheney on Monday for events across the suburbs in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan.","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/elections/2024/10/19/tim-walz-chicago-kamala-harris-election-2024-obama-pritzker-democrats-vote-politics-money","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5b4566e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2302+0+361/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F63%2Fb2%2Fd55f416b4ef6a6a9292534396fe1%2Fimg-","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-19 22:58:30","author":"Tina Sfondeles","authors":["Tina Sfondeles"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.018},{"id":260347384,"title":"Lizzo Claps Back at Donald Trump's Detroit Insults","text":"Singer Lizzo responded on Saturday to an insult made by former President Donald Trump about how his opponent Vice President Kamala Harris would make the whole country \"like Detroit.\"While speaking to the Detroit Economic Club on October 10, the Republican nominee warned guests about a possible Harris administration, \"The whole country is going to be like, you want to know the truth? It'll be like Detroit. Our whole country will end up being like Detroit if she's your president. You're going to have a mess on your hands.\"The hitmaker seemingly responded to the jab against her beloved city during an appearance at a Harris campaign event in Detroit on Saturday, \"I'm so proud to be from this city.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy Niomi Harris For Mailonline \n Published:23:36 BST, 19 October 2024 |Updated:23:41 BST, 19 October 2024 \n\nLauryn Goodman reportedly called the police on Kyle Walker's wife Annie Kilner over her shocking WhatsApp messages.\nThe influencer, 33, who was embroiled in a paternity scandal after the footballer secretly fathered her two children, alerted the authorities after the WAG, 33, allegedly said she wanted Lauryn 'dead' amid their ongoing feud. \nAnnie also branded Lauryn 'a s**g' and was said to have added in a furious text: 'She is going to be hated by the time I've finished.' \nA source told The Sun: 'Friends had told Lauryn about the \"I want her dead\" threat so she decided to put it on record with the police in case anything happened with her and her two children.'\nThe alleged texts were said to have been sent after Lauryn's son, Kairo, was born in 2020. \n\nLauryn Goodman reportedly called the police on Kyle Walker 's wife Annie Kilner over her shocking WhatsApp messages\n\nThe influencer, 33, alerted the authorities after the WAG, 33, [pictured] allegedly said she wanted Lauryn 'dead' amid their ongoing feud\nThe publication reports that Lauryn learned of the abusive texts in December before going on to report them to Cheshire Police in January. \n\n Kyle Walker's 'upset' wife Annie Kilner told WAG pal she 'wanted Lauryn Goodman dead' \nShe was reportedly told by officers that the issue was a 'conditional threat' and that she would have to take any further action through civil courts.\nThe report against Annie was said to have been kept on file, but she wasn't spoken to by the police. \nMailOnline have contacted representatives of Lauryn for comment.\nMeanwhile, a source told MailOnline that Annie is 'completely innocent' amid the situation and that any words said by her were not said 'with intent'.\nThe source explained: 'Annie doesn’t know whether to laugh or cry at Lauryn’s relentless need for public attention over this whole sorry saga.\n'Fortunately, she has a good sense of humour and a close circle of genuine friends, supportive family and a lot of public backing, which shines through whenever Lauryn tries to spread negativity about her. Annie is completely innocent in all of this.\n'The texts were sent back in 2020, in shock after discovering what Lauryn did, it’s mad that her friends even have to say this but they were never said with any intent. \n\nLauren was embroiled in a paternity scandal after footballer Kyle [pictured] secretly fathered her two children behind wife Annie's back\n\nAnnie also branded Lauryn 'a s**g' and was said to have added in a furious text: 'She is going to be hated by the time I've finished'\n\nFriends had told Lauryn about the \"I want her dead\" threat so she decided to put it on record with the police in case anything happened with her and her two children' \n'It’s clear to any logical person that it was just said in a fit of rage - during a private conversation between two friends who both expressed their shock and anger about the situation and the people involved.'\n\n Lauryn Goodman 'hires WAG Nicola McLean as manager in a bid to launch TV career off scandal' \nThey continued: 'As usual with Lauryn, her story doesn’t add up. Why reach out to the police after four years and no other ‘threats’ since that one, especially as she and Annie had recently had a fairly open, non-threatening conversation after Lauryn had ‘quickly told her’ that Kyle was the father of her second child.\n'Both Kyle and Annie, along with their friends, family, and a large portion of the public, are wondering when this petty drama will end so everyone can get back on track and enjoy their lives and respective children. It’s horrible that the kids have to keep reading this.'\nIt comes after Annie on Wednesday that Annie served the England star with divorce papers because she 'just can't forgive him for what he's done to her'. \nThe mother-of-four has instructed lawyers to begin legal proceedings as she prepares to fight for half of the Manchester City defender's £27million fortune.\nThe documents were served to him 10 days ago, and MailOnline understands Kyle had moved back into their family home in Cheshire - but not into Annie's bed.\nThe 34-year-old footballer, who earns an estimated £175,000 a week, is said to have been sleeping separately from Annie in a room on the third floor of the house.\n\nA source told MailOnline that Annie is 'completely innocent' amid the situation and that any words said by her were not said 'with intent' \n\nIt comes after Kyle's wife Annie Kilner instructed lawyers to begin legal proceedings as she prepares to fight for half of the Manchester City defender's £27million fortune \nThe couple separated last December after Walker was revealed to have fathered a second child with model Lauryn, who texted Annie to reveal the news.\nAs their tumultuous relationship hit a new low, a source told MailOnline: 'Things are as bad between them as they have ever been. It wasn't like a normal marriage.\n'They have barely been speaking to each other. She is divorcing Kyle because she just can't forgive him for what he's done to her. She can't get over it. She has tried. \n'Kyle seems to have accepted it's over. He's been happier in the last week or so. Like the weight of the world's been lifted from his shoulders.'\nChildhood sweethearts Kyle and Annie met in Sheffield as teenagers but the footballer has been embroiled in a series of sex scandals over the years.\nKyle WalkerAnnie KilnerLauryn Goodman\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nLauryn Goodman 'reported Kyle Walker's wife Annie Kilner to the police over shocking WhatsApp messages'\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nEXCLUSIVELiam Payne was forced to extend his trip to Argentina after his visa application to remain in the US was refused due to drug abuse\n\nStrictly fans left cringing by Wynne Evans and Katya's Jones' 'awkward' return to the dance floor following THAT 'hand incident' \n\nEXCLUSIVELiam Payne 'did not take his own life and could have been saved' says source close to family in bombshell new claim\n\nEXCLUSIVEThe seven-year-old who will inherit Liam Payne's vast fortune: Incredible sum he left Bear is revealed by KATIE HIND \n\nLauryn Goodman 'reported Kyle Walker's wife Annie Kilner to the police over shocking WhatsApp messages'\n\nLooking to manage your weight more effectively and feel fuller for longer?

And to be real, we have all experienced highs and lows. Especially me in my career as a Super Bowl champion and life as a father to seven amazing children.\"I have experienced low points and have to overcome adversity.

And he's always ready for the fight.\"Brown also gave a shoutout to Steelers fans in his rally speech. He also acknowledged how the media has called both him and the former president \"crazy.\"\"Honored to be here with the best fans in the world,\" Brown said. \"Make some noise for the Steelers fan. But before I get too deep in my speech, I want to say, I know the media is going to call me and Trump crazy for having me speak here. But I want to make this clear—we are not [crazy], they are.

He is expected to watch the game from a suite with Brown and Bell as well as elected officials.Brown is a controversial figure in the world of football. He has been arrested for allegedly not paying child support and also faced an arrest warrant over domestic battery allegations. The allegations were later dropped.A former trainer sued Brown in 2019 for alleged sexual assault. Brown denied the allegations and the case eventually reached a settlement.For more NFL news, visit Newsweek Sports.","summary":"Former Pittsburgh Steelers greats Antonio Brown and Le'Veon Bell attended Donald Trump's rally in Latrobe, Pennsylvania Saturday.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/sports/nfl/former-steelers-star-joins-antonio-brown-endorsing-donald-trump-president-1971753","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2499532/antonio-brown.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-19 22:41:16","author":"Valentina Martinez","authors":["Valentina Martinez"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.069},{"id":260346500,"title":"Michael Cohen Predicts Swing State That Will Be 'Called Early'","text":"Michael Cohen says Pennsylvania, a crucial battleground state in the presidential election, will be \"called early\" for Vice President Kamala Harris, in a new episode of his podcast.Cohen, now a vocal critic of former President Donald Trump, previously worked as his lawyer and testified against him in his criminal hush money trial in May.During a Saturday \"Mea Culpa\" podcast episode on the left-leaning outlet MeidasTouch Network, Cohen spoke with Gabriel Sherman, the writer of \"The Apprentice\" biopic.The film, directed by Ali Abbasi, tells a version of Trump's life in New York in the 1970s and 1980s, focusing on his relationships with mentor Roy Cohn and his first wife, Ivana Trump.Trump has expressed his disapproval of the movie on his Truth Socia platform, writing \"A FAKE and CLASSLESS Movie written about me, called, The Apprentice (Do they even have the right to use that name without approval?), will hopefully 'bomb,'\" he wrote.About forty minutes into their conversation, Sherman reflects on national polling in the presidential election, noting that most polls show Harris leading Trump in the popular vote, but \"if you look at the swing state polls, they're much closer, particularly in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan.\"Harris and Trump continue to fluctuate and edge out one another in swing state polls, often with leads within the margin of errors.While nationwide and aggregate polls gauge voter sentiment, the presidential election is ultimately decided by individual states and their Electoral College votes.To win the presidency, a candidate must secure 270 electoral votes, which doesn't always align with the national popular vote.State-specific victories are crucial to securing electoral votes, as seen in the 2016 election, when former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton won the popular vote but lost the presidency by failing to reach 270 Electoral College votes.\"I think he [Trump] loses by a bigger margin than what you think. I believe Pennsylvania will be called early in the race, because I believe that the people of Pennsylvania, and the Black community of Pennsylvania and Gen Z I think they [expletive] hate him,\" Cohen said.Pennsylvania, which boasts 19 Electoral College votes—more than any other swing state—could determine the outcome of the election. An early call is likely to signal who wins the presidency.Harris' clearest path to victory next month would be to win the three \"blue wall\" battleground states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, barring any shock results elsewhere. Trump's most efficient path to 270 Electoral College votes would be to win the swing states of North Carolina and Georgia while flipping Pennsylvania.Cohen continued, \"My feeling is that the same now applies with Michigan,\" citing union support for Harris, although while Harris is backed by the United Auto Workers, the Teamsters and the International Association of Fire Fighters have notably declined to endorse either candidate this election.Cohen said he believes there are many people who are just agreeing with their family members in support of Trump's candidacy, \"But then they get to the polls and then they do the exact opposite,\" implying they will vote for Harris.Sherman replied, \"But in 2016 there was the 'secret' Trump vote that went the other way, right?\" In 2016, majority of polls predicted Clinton to win the White House; however, in part due to a number of silent, \"secret\" Trump voters, he pulled ahead on election night. Cohen said he believed this time they would go \"the opposite way,\" and vote for Harris.\"I do not believe that Trump will accept the defeat, he will continue because that's the grift, that's all he has got left,\" he said.Newsweek has reached out to Trump's campaign via email on Saturday.Concerns have grown over the possibility that, if Trump loses, he might reject the results, as Trump did not accept the 2020 election results, claiming was stolen from him, despite no evidence of widespread voter fraud.He has repeatedly said he would accept the 2024 results only if it's a \"fair and free election,\" raising doubts about the integrity of the process.The state has extraordinary tight margins, much narrower than some national aggregate polls that show Harris with a 2-percentage point lead.The New York Times' Pennsylvania aggregate poll has Harris ahead of Trump, 49 to 48 percent while The Hill's aggregate polling puts Harris at 48.7 percent and Trump at 48.3 percent in the state.FiveThirtyEight shows a much closer race, with a 0.1 percent margin in the Keystone State with Harris slightly leading at 47.9 percent and Trump at 47.7 percent.","summary":"Michael Cohen believes Donald Trump will lose the election, with key swing states Pennsylvania and Michigan going to Kamala Harris.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/michael-cohen-donald-trump-lose-election-swing-states-1971730","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2499480/michael-cohen.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-19 22:39:21","author":"Mandy Taheri","authors":["Mandy Taheri"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.259},{"id":260346206,"title":"Kamala Harris joined by Lizzo at campaign event; Donald Trump rallies in Pennsylvania – live","text":"Usher, an influential R&B musician and bedrock of Atlanta’s musical contributions, spoke briefly to a crowd of about 10,000 Saturday at Lakewood Amphitheater in Atlanta assembled for a campaign rally for Kamala Harris with Barack Obama.\n\nUsher did not perform, though he has two concerts scheduled in Atlanta this weekend.

That’s really insane right. \n\n‘And by the way, tampon Tim Walz, he isn’t a real football coach. He could never guard me.’\n\nThe Super Bowl winner arrived alongside fellow former Steeler, Le’Veon Bell, who donned a t-shirt featuring photos of Trump and opponent Kamala Harris with the slogan, ‘Trump or the Tramp?’ \n\nThe pair of former footballers greeted the crowd as they posed for selfies with the supporters waiting in line to enter the rally just under three hours before it is slated to begin. \n\nBrown had hinted he would be making a speech earlier this week in a social media post, which contained a screenshot of an email allegedly from Trump’s campaign. \n\n‘Time to help make REAL Change,’ he wrote alongside the photo. ‘Time to make a Difference. It is Time.’\n\nBrown has been outspoken of his support of the 45th president online, most recently accusing NBC of plotting against fellow Trump supporter Elon Musk at a Steelers game earlier this month. \n\nThe X chief had whipped Pittsburgh fans into a frenzy as he attended a prime-time game at Acrisure Stadium – a day after joining Donald Trump on stage at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nDespite the 53-year-old’s attendance at the Steelers’ Week 5 matchup, Musk failed to receive the Taylor Swift treatment as NBC’s coverage didn’t appear to show him in the stands.\n\nBrown claimed the network intentionally avoiding Musk on its broadcast as a form of media censorship against Trump’s campaign.\n\n‘Another reason to get out in Vote,’ he posted. ‘Media censoring is real and will only get worse unless change.’ \n\nThere is no evidence to suggest that NBC did intentionally avoid showing Musk as Brown alleged. DailyMail.com contacted NBC Sports for comment. \n\nBrown first publicly endorsed Trump in May and even vowed to help him celebrate a second term.\n\n‘I’ll endorse Trump,’ Brown told Outkick. ‘I never met him. I have admiration for his business moves and I study his dad, Fred Trump.\n\n‘But I think Donald Trump is a good businessman, he comes from a good family and he’s been a good president.\n\nHe added: ‘You know he likes black people running campaigns, preferably football players. So Donald Trump, you heard it right here from the mouth of AB man: inauguration, send me my bag or whatever…’\n\nBrown also praised Trump for the ‘great things’ he had done ‘for a lot of my brothers in the music industry.’\n\nEven in retirement, the 35-year-old has rarely been out of the headlines due to financial issues and a string of controversial outbursts on social media which has seen him taunt the likes of Caitlin Clark and Tom Brady. \n\nJust last month, he taunted Taylor Swift amid her romance with Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce. \n\nThe former wideout referred to Swift’s anatomy before appearing to suggest that Kelce should date a black woman. \n\nPrior to that, he wrote alongside a photo of Taylor and Brittany Mahomes hugging each other: ‘White People for Trump’. \n\nIt came after Brittany, the wife of Chiefs quarterback Patrick and close friend of the popstar, faced backlash for liking a Trump-related post. \n\nIn March, he shared what seemed to be an AI-generated cartoon image of himself in a Pittsburgh Steelers jersey, kissing the songstress , who is wearing a light blue cheerleader’s uniform.\n\n‘Move over Jizelle, what these Swifties talkin bout? #CTESPN,’ he wrote alongside the image on X, formerly known as Twitter, referring to Tom Brady’s ex-wife Gisele Bundchen.\n\nBrown appeared to be attempting to rile up Taylor’s fans, known as ‘Swifties’, who are renowned for their fierce loyalty and protectiveness of the Anti-Hero hitmaker.\n\nThe cartoon isn’t the first time Brown has used doctored images to bait a fellow NFL star as he previously used Gisele as a means to troll his former friend and teammate Brady. \n\nBrady had encouraged the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to acquire the embattled Brown in 2020 amid accusations of sexual assault and harassment, which he has since settled out of court. He even allowed Brown to stay with him in preparation for the season.\n\nA year earlier, Brady had pushed for the New England Patriots to sign Brown, only to have the team cut him after one game when the sexual misconduct allegation first surfaced.\n\nBut Brown has attacked his former teammate with the troubled star continuously blaming Brady for the end of his career.\n\nBrown antagonized Brady over his divorce from Gisele in 2022. He frequently posted photoshopped photos, suggesting that he’s having a romantic relationship with Brady’s ex.","summary":"Former NFL star Antonio Brown has continued to show his support for&#8230;","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/antonio-brown-attends-donald-trumps-rally-in-pennsylvania-to-show-continued-backing-for-ex-president/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/rewrite-this-title-Antonio-Brown-arrives-at-Donald-Trump-rally-800x430.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-19 22:29:04","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.057},{"id":260346416,"title":"Interest On US National Debt Tops 'Astounding' $1 Trillion For First Time","text":"Interest on the U.S. national debt topped $1 trillion for the first time during fiscal 2024, as the annual budget deficit reached its highest level except during the COVID-19 pandemic.Figures released Friday by the Treasury Department show the federal government spent a $1.13 trillion on gross interest payments to holders of T-bills, notes, bonds and other securities during the 12 months that ended September.30.The record outlay represents an increase of $254 billion, or 29 percent, over fiscal 2023, which the Treasury Department said was \"largely due to higher interest rates\" set by the Federal Reserve to tame inflation.In a prepared statement, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said that inflation had \"fallen more than two thirds from its peak while the labor market remains strong.\"Yellen also said outgoing President Joe Biden's proposed fiscal 2025 budget \"reduces the deficit by $3 trillion by asking corporations and the wealthiest Americans to pay their fair share, while preserving our important investments in our country's future.\"The House and Senate have yet to pass budget bills and the federal government is now being financed through December 20 under terms of a continuing resolution approved last month.The head of the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget think tank called the nearly $900 billion in net interest payments on the debt \"just a truly astounding figure.\"\"That's more than we spent on national defense, Medicare, and children at the federal level,\" committee president Maya MacGuineas said in a prepared statement. \"The national debt is on track to reach a record share of the economy in just two years, a sobering milestone for both the next Congress and whoever wins the presidency in November.\"Campaign promises made by Vice President Kamala Harris would add an estimated $3.5 trillion to the debt through 2035, while former President Donald Trump would more than double that amount to $7.5 trillion, according to the committee.The constantly growing national debt is now $35.8 trillion and equivalent to more than 122.3% of the nation's gross domestic product, according to the U.S. Debt Clock website.MacGuineas also blasted the government for spending $6.75 trillion during fiscal 2024, up 8 percent and resulting in a $1.83 trillion deficit.MacGuineas said the size of the budget gap meant that the government \"borrowed a whopping $5 billion on average every day.\"\"We're borrowing nearly double the amount we borrowed annually before the pandemic, and this is projected to grow indefinitely.

Michigan’s online “voting dashboard” indicated that, by Saturday morning, more than 1 million mail-in ballots had been received.\n\nIt was one of several strong showings across the country, indicating a possible surge in voter enthusiasm. States like North Carolina and Georgia have notched records for early-voting turnout this week, according to officials.\n\nThe chief operating officer for Georgia’s secretary of state, Gabriel Sterling, posted on social media that turnout continues to be high. Georgia’s first day of early voting was Tuesday.\n\n“Congratulations to the counties and especially our great Georgia voters. Y’all have broken another RECORD. Biggest turnout ever for a General Election Saturday,” Sterling wrote.\n\nWhile experts caution against extrapolating too much from the numbers, political analysts note that Democrats have traditionally seen a boost from large early turnouts.\n\nHarris sought to build on this year’s momentum during her weekend campaign stops.\n\n“Georgia started early voting, broke historic records. North Carolina started early voting, broke historic records in North Carolina. Now, who is the capital of producing records?” she told supporters in Detroit, with a winking reference to the city’s music industry.\n\n“So we are going to break some records here in Detroit today.”\n\nAddressing war in Gaza\n\nDuring her visit to Michigan, Harris also took the opportunity to repeat her call for a ceasefire in Gaza, where Israel has led a yearlong military campaign, killing more than 42,500 Palestinians.\n\nUS support for Israel and its war has eroded support for Democrats among Arab and Muslim Americans in Michigan.\n\nThe state boasts the largest concentration of Arab Americans in the country, and it also the home of a national protest movement against the administration of President Joe Biden over its stance on the war.\n\nHarris, who has also been a recipient of that criticism, voiced hope that the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in Gaza might usher in an end to hostilities.\n\n“This creates an opening that I believe we must take full advantage of — to dedicate ourselves to ending this war and bringing the hostages home,” Harris told reporters in Detroit.\n\nShe added that Middle East policy has long been a difficult issue for the US.\n\n“It has never been easy,” Harris said. “But that doesn’t mean we give up.”\n\nRazzing Trump\n\nAt her campaign rally in Detroit, Harris addressed supporters in front of “Detroit Votes Early” signs — and she and other speakers used their platform to slap back at Republican criticisms of the city.\n\nEarlier in the month, Trump cast Detroit in an unflattering light, telling the Detroit Economic Club that another Democratic president would render the entire country like the “Motor City”.\n\n“Our whole country will end up being like Detroit if she’s your president,” Trump said of Harris, calling Detroit “a mess”.\n\nHarris, by contrast, took the stage on Saturday in a T-shirt that read “Detroit vs Everybody”, a slogan that has adorned clothing lines and rap songs.\n\nLizzo, meanwhile, addressed Trump’s comments more bluntly. “I’m so proud to be from this city,” she told the crowd. “You know, they say if Kamala wins, then the whole country will be like Detroit. Proud like Detroit. Resilient like Detroit.”\n\n“Put some respect on Detroit’s name,” she added.\n\nCelebrity support\n\nAnalysts in general say that the Democratic Party has been more successful in rallying star power to its cause this election cycle.\n\nHarris not only enjoys the endorsement of figures like Lizzo and Usher, but celebrities like Taylor Swift, Oprah and George Clooney have also announced their support for her since she became the presidential candidate in July.\n\nIt is not clear, however, if celebrity support actually makes a difference in a campaign. More than 76 percent of voters polled recently by Quinnipiac University said Swift’s endorsement would not affect their ballots.\n\nThe same goes for Republicans. Two-thirds of those surveyed said entrepreneur Elon Musk’s recent support for Trump would not affect their vote either.\n\nBut Democrats are nevertheless banking on the glitter of its star power.\n\nThis upcoming week, for instance, former President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle Obama are hitting the campaign trail, with only two weeks to go before the election.\n\nIt will be the first time Michelle has done the rally circuit. Barack, meanwhile, made his first campaign-trail appearance in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, earlier this month.\n\nBoth Harris and Trump are trying to squeak ahead in the crucial last few weeks of campaigning. Polling averages show the two are basically tied in the lead-up to the vote.","summary":"As Harris continues her tour through US swing states, musicians Usher and Lizzo campaign on her behalf.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/19/kamala-harriss-campaign-flexes-celebrity-support-in-detroit-and-atlanta?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-10-19T200643Z_1633001034_RC2VNAAYZMNC_RTRMADP_3_USA-ELECTION-HARRIS-1729374762.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-19 22:10:50","author":"Al Jazeera,Apps Support","authors":["Al Jazeera","Apps Support"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":0.158},{"id":260344818,"title":"‘Weak and pathetic’: Trump seethes as Mark Cuban campaigns for Harris","text":"Former President Donald Trump on Saturday railed against fellow billionaire Mark Cuban, who has been vigorously campaigning for his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\n“Mark Cuban is a Loser,” Trump wrote in a Saturday Truth Social post. “Wouldn’t take his phone calls anymore while at the White House, and he went rogue.

As part of an in-depth series, Jevans Nyabiage takes a look at whether Africa is expecting a president with African heritage to benefit the continent.\nWiping away tears, US Vice-President Kamala Harris walked around Cape Coast Castle on a visit to Ghana last year. The centuries-old fort has a tortured history as a holding prison for slaves before they were forced onto ships to sail to the Americas.\n“The horror of what happened here must always be remembered,” Harris said during the emotional tour. “History must be learned.”\nAcross hundreds of years, African people were kidnapped, tortured, starved and crowded onto ships at Cape Coast Castle for the long and dangerous ocean voyage to the Americas and the Caribbean.\nHarris, the daughter of an Indian-born mother and a Jamaican-born father, used the visit to speak of her connection to the African continent – also talking about her time as a young girl visiting Zambian capital Lusaka, where her grandfather lived.\n“Because of this history, this continent, of course, has a special significance for me personally as the first black vice-president of the United States of America,” she said.\nWhile Harris’ black heritage may be winning over African-American voters in the race with former president Donald Trump for the White House, any hope that her potential win would also see drastic change in US policy towards the African continent is a matter for debate, according to observers.\nIn fact, they say, if Africa has learned anything from recent history, it is that regardless of who is sitting in the Oval Office, Africa will be set firmly in the “periphery” of their US foreign policy vision.\n\nX.N. Iraki, an economics professor at the University of Nairobi, said Africans had come to realise that the US president may not change Africa as much as expected.\n“Obama didn’t change Africa that much and we can’t talk of Obama’s dividends. Yet Obama was closer to Africa than Harris,” Iraki said of former US president Barack Obama, the son of a white American mother and a black Kenyan father.\nLooking at Harris and Trump, he said both candidates’ policies took care of American interests and were unlikely to change much for African countries.\n“Despite Trump being outspoken, with ‘s***holes’, it’s unlikely that there will be a drastic shift in American policy towards Africa, unless as a reaction to China,” Iraki said, referring to remarks then-president Trump made in 2018, in which he called Haiti, El Salvador and African countries “s***holes”.\nMeanwhile, since US President Joe Biden left the race and Harris became the Democratic presidential candidate, her support among black registered voters has increased significantly, according to Francis Owusu, a professor of community and regional planning at Iowa State University. He referenced the results of a September poll by Pew Research Centre which showed that 84 per cent of black voters would vote for Harris.\nAlthough most African-Americans historically vote for the Democratic Party during presidential elections, they are not a monolithic voting bloc. Neither were they one-issue voters, he said.\nHowever, he said, the Harris poll figure was lower than the 92 per cent of black Americans who voted for Joe Biden in 2020.\nConversely, if Trump won, Africa would anticipate a continuation of his previous laissez-faire approach towards the continent, according to Gustavo de Carvalho, a senior researcher at the South African Institute of International Affairs.\nHis ‘America first’ agenda and inclination towards isolationism suggest that Africa would not be a priority in his foreign policy\nGustavo de Carvalho, senior researcher\nDuring Trump’s previous term from 2017 to 2021, US policy towards Africa was put on the back burner, as “America first” rhetoric took centre stage.\n“His America first agenda and inclination towards isolationism suggest that Africa would not be a priority in his foreign policy,” de Carvalho said. “This could potentially widen the gap in US-Africa relations, especially in light of the growing influence of China.”\nHe said Trump’s past rhetoric and lack of engagement with the continent could further erode trust among its leaders, diminishing US leverage in Africa, which has already been in decline.\nBut if Trump’s approach to Africa would be defined by disinterest, Harris’ approach would be likely to follow Biden’s – treating African countries as pawns in a geopolitical tug of war, according to de Carvalho.\nHarris had little foreign policy experience before becoming vice-president in 2021. If she wins in November, she is expected to carry on Biden’s established Africa policy, which is largely focused on countering growing Chinese and Russian influence through US investment and funding for infrastructure, agriculture, health and security.\nBut it is a policy fraught with risks.\n“This transactional dynamic has the potential to weaken long-term partnerships with African states,” de Carvalho said.\n\nIt was the Biden administration that partnered with Group of Seven (G7) nations to launch the US$600 billion Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) – to challenge China’s Belt and Road Initiative.\nAs part of PGII, Washington is bankrolling the refurbishment of the 1,300km (800-mile) Lobito Corridor railway, which runs from the port of Lobito, on the Angolan Atlantic Ocean coast, to the Democratic Republic of the Congo and within reach of northwest Zambia. The US is also mobilising funding for a greenfield railway extension to copper-rich Zambia. Tanzania has recently signed a deal with the US, allowing the extension of the railway to the Indian coast of Tanzania.\nThe White House says it has since mobilised about US$3 billion for the Lobito Corridor – Washington’s largest infrastructure financing in Africa for decades. Biden was set to visit Angola on October 13-15, but the trip was cancelled.\nAfrica also hopes to renew the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), set to expire in 2025, which was established in 2000 by then-president Bill Clinton to provide duty-free access to the US market for African products – important for growing trade and investment ties.\nBut since 2009, China has been Africa’s largest trading partner. China is also Africa’s largest bilateral lender, funding belt and road mega-projects such as ports, highways and hydropower dams.\nAt the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) held in Beijing in September, Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged US$51 billion in investment in Africa over three years.\nMeanwhile, during US-Africa Leaders summit in Washington in 2022, Biden pledged US$55 billion in financing and investment to Africa over three years. It was one of the most expansive US commitments to Africa ever seen.\nWith Beijing’s influence in Africa firmly established, the US has also ramped up visits by senior officials, including the secretary of state, treasury secretary, first lady – and Harris’ 2023 visit in her capacity as vice-president.\nHer tour of Ghana, Tanzania and Zambia last year aimed to not only strengthen relations with African countries but to promote open societies with a particular focus on women’s empowerment and LGBTQ rights.\n“A push for LGBTQ rights by the Harris administration will continue to be a sore point in the relationship,” Owusu of Iowa State University said.\n\nSteven Gruzd, a programme head at the South African Institute of International Affairs (SAIIA), a think tank in Johannesburg, said a second Trump term would be likely to ignore Africa and its concerns, or see it purely in terms of security and rivalry with China and Russia.\nOn the other hand, a Harris presidency “would represent continuity with the Biden administration”, according to Gruzd.\n“But I still do not expect African issues to be near the top of her agenda either – especially with wars in the Middle East and Ukraine,” he said.\nThe US is such a significant player in the global economic and security architecture that most African leaders would always want to be on good terms with whoever was in the White House, according to W. Gyude Moore, a non-resident fellow at the Washington-based Centre for Global Development and a former -public works minister in Liberia.\n“Comparing the Trump administration and the Biden-Harris approaches to Africa, it would follow that most Africans will hold higher hopes for more substantive engagement from Harris than Trump,” Moore said, adding that both candidates had centred their campaigns around domestic politics and, when veering into international affairs, China and the Middle East were the main focus.\n“There is not much bandwidth dedicated to Africa or Africa-specific policies. Our best bet is to assume that a Harris administration will be similar to the Biden administration in its approach to Africa,” Moore said. “Under a second Trump administration, it would appear that we will see more of the same as the first Trump administration.”\n\nCarlos Lopes, a professor at the Nelson Mandela School of Public Governance at the University of Cape Town in South Africa, said many Africans and members of the diaspora recognised that Washington’s approach was largely driven by geostrategic interests rather than any genuine partnership model.\n“The perception is that Harris, like her predecessors, will not bring any transformative changes to the US-Africa relationship,” Lopes said.\nHe said this scepticism was amplified by the continuity in policy between Democratic and Republican administrations, where Africa often becomes a focus only when it aligns with US security or economic concerns, rather than as a priority for its own developmental or political aspirations.\n“Harris, therefore, may not carry the same hope and expectations as president Obama once did. Even Obama disappointed, which makes Africans cautious about her potential impact,” Lopes said.\nRecently, Lopes said, the US relations with Africa had been characterised by a dual focus on security – particularly through a militarised lens that emerged post-September 11 under President George W. Bush – and countering China’s influence in the region.\n“Whether it’s Trump or Harris, Africa remains on the periphery of US foreign policy priorities, with the actual impact likely to be minimal,” Lopes said.","summary":"Regardless of who wins the coming US presidential election, it is unlikely to change much for African countries, experts say.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/3281950/harris-or-trump-what-do-us-presidential-candidates-offer-africa","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/10/19/e8ecb6f7-07bc-4afd-b14c-3fdc64a9e955_d4c9734f.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-19 22:00:08","author":"Jevans Nyabiage","authors":["Jevans Nyabiage"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.25},{"id":260344614,"title":"Day in Photos: G7 Summit Protest, Train Derailment, and Fallen Cyclist","text":"Residents participate in early voting at a community center in Detroit, Mich., on Oct. 19, 2024.

[+] Harris's (R) history of allergies. (Photo by SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images)\nAFP via Getty Images\n\nOn October 15, Republican Presidential nominee Donald Trump offered shall we say a rather rash assessment of the health of his Democratic opponent Vice President Kamala Harris. Three days prior, Joshua Simmons, MD, the physician to the Vice President, had released a letter listing his medical assessment of Harris. In response to this, former President Trump posted the following on Truth Social: “I have just seen Kamala’s Report, and it is not good. According to her Doctor’s Report, she suffers from ‘urticaria,’ defined as ‘a rash of round, red welts on the skin that itch intensely, sometimes with dangerous swelling.’” Yep, Trump was buzzing about Harris having hives, which is basically what urticaria is.\n\nTrump’s reaction ran on with something that hit right on the nose (and eyes): “She also has ‘allergic rhinitis and allergic conjunctivitis,’ a very messy and dangerous situation. These are deeply serious conditions that clearly impact her functioning.” You can see the rest of his Truth Social post here:\n\nFrom Truth Social\nFrom Truth Social\n\nYikes, a very messy and dangerous situation? Deeply serious conditions that clearly impact her functioning? Should all of this cause concern? It’s gotta be truth, right, because it is on something called Truth Social. Well, let’s take a medical, scientific look at what these conditions really are.\n\nOK, no one can deny that having a runny nose can be a very messy situation. You’ve got to get tissues, sometimes a lot of tissues. And if you leave these tissues crumpled up all over the place like on the floor, then it could get messy and dangerous as someone could slip and fall.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nWhat To Know About Liam Payne’s Death: Cowell, Cole And Shawn Mendes React\n\nMicrosoft Windows Deadline—10 Days To Update Or Stop Using Your PC\n\nTesla Cybertruck Gets Massive Price Cut For Both AWD And Cyberbeast\n\nAllergic rhinitis is basically when you have an irritated—often red, itchy and runny— nose from allergies. Rhinitis starts with the Greek root “rhino,” which in this case is not a political term but rather stands for “nose” as in that thing in the middle of your face. It ends with the suffix “itis,” which stands for inflammation. Therefore, rhinitis simply means inflammation of the nose, meaning the inside of the nose.\n\nAllergic rhinitis a very common condition. It typically results from an allergic reaction to something floating in the air like pollen, dust, mold, skin flakes from different animals or some kind of cologne like one branded by a Presidential candidate.\n\nIs this a “deeply serious condition” like, oh, how about Covid-19? You know, that thing that some politicians were trying to minimize in 2020. Umm, you don’t often hear someone say, “We took her to the hospital but she didn’t make it because her nose just kept running form allergies?” Sure, allergic rhinitis in some cases can cause result in symptoms that impeded daily activities. But in many situations, people can make lifestyle modifications to avoid the allergens like buying an air purifier. They also may use some combination of over-the-counter medications like antihistamines, decongestants and nasal corticosteroid sprays to manage the symptoms. If symptoms remain unmanageable, they may see a doctor for more involved treatments such as allergy shots.\n\nThe same kind of medical management applies to allergic conjunctivitis. That’s also an allergic reaction, except the eyes have it. The conjunctiva is a thin and clear membrane that lines the inside of your eyelid and the white part of your eye. Conjunctivitis is the inflammation of this membrane, which can lead to red, itchy and watery eyes.\n\nYou know what else can result from allergies? Urticaria, which is a medical term for hives. Around 20 percent of people will suffer urticaria at some point in their lives, according to the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology. Hives are when you develop red or skin-colored rashes that are itchy and raised. They can have little bumps, otherwise known as wheals. These rashes tend to blanch—meaning turn white—when pressed.\n\nNow, while urticaria can be “whealy” uncomfortable, you don’t tend to hear people say, “Oh, she can’t do that job because of urticaria,” unless the job is something like working in a latex factory or modeling latex outfits when the allergic trigger is latex. Typically, people will deal with urticaria by avoiding what happens to be triggers for them such as foods like peanuts, eggs, nuts and shellfish, medications, insect stings or bites, temperature changes, physical activity, sun exposure, infections, pet dander or pollen. Anti-histamines and steroid cremes may help too. As with allergic rhinitis and allergic conjunctivitis, a doctor can help identify the triggers and determine how to best manage symptoms.\n\nOne thing that’s clear from Simmons’ letter is that Harris has had a history of allergies. The letter indicated that, “Her allergic symptoms primarily consist of allergic rhinitis and allergic conjunctivitis and have previously been well-managed with over-the-counter and prescription medications such as Allegra (fexofenadine), Atrovent (ipratropium bromide) nasal spray and Pataday (olopatadine) eye drops.” He also wrote, “The urticaria are sporadic and transient and do not seem to be triggered by a particular exposure nor are they associated with other symptoms.” The letter emphasized that these symptoms have responded well to common medications and that “she has never experienced severe symptoms, angioedema, or anaphylaxis.”\n\nSo all in all, what Simmons wrote about Harris’s allergies doesn’t really deserve that much of a reaction, so to speak.\n\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

Brown spent the majority of his career in Pittsburgh as a star for the Steelers, before a controversial exit from the team. He returned to the city to a cheering crowd as he \"looks to make a positive difference.\" The former All-Pro wide receiver took the stage at a rally to deliver a speech on behalf of Trump, while mocking Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. \"Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, did you really know they want to put tampons in the boys' bathroom?\" Brown asked the crowd. \"That's really insane, right?\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Walz, the governor of Minnesota since 2019, earned the nickname \"Tampon Tim\" from Republican opponents in 2023 after Walz signed a Minnesota law that mandates tampons be provided free of charge in public schools \"to all menstruating students in restrooms regularly used by students in grades 4 to 12,\" including male students. The Harris-Walz campaign has also made an effort to tie Walz's stint as an assistant coach of the Mankato West High School football team in Minnesota in the 1990s to his candidacy. During Walz's tenure as an assistant on the staff, the team won a state championship in 1999. But Brown showed no respect for the former assistant's short coaching career during his speech Saturday. \"And, by the way, Tampon Tim Walz, he isn't a real football coach. He could never guard me,\" Brown said. \"Business will be booming going against Tampon Tim Walz.\" Brown even brought to the stage former Steelers teammate Le'Veon Bell, who showed his support for Trump with a T-shirt. Brown, a seven-time Pro Bowler and Super Bowl champion, played the first nine years of his career in Pittsburgh, before a feud with former quarterback Ben Roethlisberger resulted in him being traded to the Raiders in 2019. During Saturday's speech, Brown gave a shoutout to Roethlisberger, saying he was still his \"favorite quarterback.\" Brown was out of the NFL for most of 2019 and the start of the 2020 season after a string of controversies in 2019, including allegations of sexual assault. But Brown returned to join Tom Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, helping the Buccaneers win the 2021 Super Bowl during the COVID-19 pandemic. Brown's career with Tampa Bay ended after he threw his equipment into the crowd during a game against the New York Jets in Week 17 of the 2021 season. He hasn't played in the NFL since. Multiple arrest warrants have been issued since then for Brown, who has devoted his time to controversial social media activity and forming his own unofficial brand he calls \"CTESPN,\" which he says is meant to explore the traumas that athletes have been through. Brown has suggested he has chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), due to repeated brain injuries from football, and that his erratic behavior is a result of the disease. FORMER NFL STAR AND TRUMP SUPPORTER ANTONIO BROWN JOINS VOTER-REGISTRATION EFFORT IN KEY SWING STATE CTE is a degenerative brain disease that can develop after repeated concussions or other traumatic brain injuries. The disease can cause behavioral and mood problems and difficulty thinking and can also lead to dementia. However, CTE can only be diagnosed with a brain autopsy after someone has died. Many of Brown's fans live in western Pennsylvania and could cast critical votes in November. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Brown has been a vocal supporter of former President Trump throughout the current election cycle. The former football star said in May he would endorse Trump during an interview with OutKick's Nick Adams, praising the former president's background and contributions to figures in the hip-hop industry. \"I've never met him. I've got admiration for his business moves, and I study his dad, Fred Trump. But I think Donald Trump is a good businessman and come[s] from a good family and has been a good president,\" Brown said. \"I think he does some great things for my brothers in the music industry in regards to Lil Wayne, Kodak [Black].\" Brown has frequently expressed his support for Trump through memes and more straightforward political messaging on his social media platforms. After the assassination attempt on Trump during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, in July, Brown commended the former president for his resilience. \"Cue up Many Men by 50 and we gonna win the presidency in a landslide F---ing Legend of the Decade,\" Brown wrote on X. Brown announced he would be joining the voter registration effort in Pennsylvania, a key battleground state, Oct. 4. He has ramped up his pro-Trump messaging on social media since then and has even met with Trump's running mate, JD Vance, and Donald Trump Jr. A new Fox News survey of Pennsylvania voters finds Harris narrowly ahead of Trump by two points (50-48%) among registered voters, while the race is tied at 49% each among likely voters. Trump’s most loyal followers include men, Whites without a college degree, independents and rural voters. He has nearly doubled his lead among men and the small group of independents since July.

Each group, an official arm of its respective party, maintains canvassing efforts to inform Americans about their ability to continue voting and have a say in their homeland's future.The Federal Voting Assistance Program (FVAP) reports that around 4.4 million Americans live overseas, but because of the lack of clear data on eligibility, the total number of voting Americans in that population remains an estimate at best. Some estimates have as many as 9 million Americans living overseas.The FVAP believes that 2.8 million of those Americans are eligible. Only around 3.4 percent of them voted in 2022, and only around 8 percent voted in 2020. The greatest number of those voters live in Canada and the United Kingdom—around 605,000 and 298,000, respectively.The next largest groups live in France and Israel, each with a population of around 150,000, followed by around 100,000 Americans who live in Japan.Democrats Abroad, which relies entirely on volunteer participation, maintains committees in 52 different countries. Members of the group live in over 190 countries, according to its website.The Windsor, Canada, chapter of Democrats Abroad, based near the border between Michigan and Canada, has canvassed voters in the Detroit-Windsor area, hitting 1,000 doors ahead of the final weeks and with plans to hit another 1,500 before November.\"We have been getting a great deal of support and encouragement and very little resistance,\" David Shelton of the Windsor Chapter told columnist Jason Sattler, a member of the USA Today Board of Contributors from 2017 to 2021. \"I find this notable because we are 'cold knocking' at every door on the streets we select.\"Democrats Abroad believes that Windsor could have over 20,000 eligible American voters. The group points to the previous presidential election, in which states such as Arizona, Georgia and Wisconsin were decided by tens of thousands of votes.Democrats Abroad UK has rolled out its own initiative to try to tap the 200,000 or more voters living in London and other major British cities. The group has put up ads in bus stops and other high-traffic areas, but it has also looked to digital initiatives to reach voters and let them know they have a say in their homeland's election, according to The Guardian.The group has also looked to tap overseas university students, with many studying in Oxford, Cambridge or St. Andrews.Trump has made overtures to these voters, offering tax breaks to Americans living overseas during a speech at the Detroit Economic Club earlier this month.\"You have to make sure that you are registered and you are going to vote because I'm going to take very good care of you,\" he said in a video posted by Republicans Overseas CEO Solomon Yue.However, the Republican Party has filed a series of lawsuits in battleground states aimed at isolating the overseas votes. A lawsuit filed in Pennsylvania demands that courts set aside all overseas ballots—including those from military voters—for additional verification, according to ABC News.\"We are already hearing military voters from all states who feel discouraged from participating, if they have concern that their ballot won't even be counted,\" Sarah Streyder, who is stationed in England because her husband serves in the Space Force, told reporters.State officials have said the lawsuits represent nothing more than \"an attempt to confuse and frighten people ahead of an important election,\" assuring that any ballots sent out are eligible.","summary":"Both political parties look to eligible U.S. voters living abroad, including those in Canada.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/democrats-republicans-court-overseas-voters-election-1971720","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2499496/voting-polling-location.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-19 21:34:10","author":"Peter Aitken","authors":["Peter Aitken"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.082},{"id":260343078,"title":"Kamala Harris publicly agrees with protestor accusing Israel of genocide: ‘What he’s talking about, it’s real’","text":"Vice President Harris publicly agreed with a protestor this week who interrupted her to accuse Israel of committing “genocide.” \n\nThe moment went down during a campaign stop Thursday at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, when a pro-Hamas UWM student began yelling out while the Democratic presidential nominee was speaking, video of the exchange showed. \n\n“I am so invested in you all, in every way,” Harris can be heard saying as the interruption began.\n\n“And in genocide right?” the heckler said. \n\n“Billions of dollars in genocide.

Coney Dogs, Faygo and Lizzo,” the singer joked to a rally crowd, pointing to herself after listing off the meat-on-a-stick and soda that the city is famous for.\n\n She said it was time to “put some respect on Detroit’s name” noting that the city had revolutionized the auto and music industries and adding that she’d already cast her ballot for Harris since voting early was “a power move.”\n\n Heaps of praise for the Motor City came after Trump, the former president, insulted it during a recent campaign stop. And Harris continued the theme, saying of her campaign, “Like the people of Detroit, we have grit, we have excellence, we have history.”\n\n Arms wide open as she took the stage, Harris let the crowd see she was wearing under her blazer a “Detroit vs. Everybody” T-shirt that the owner of the business that produces them gave her during a previous stop in the city earlier in the week. She also moved around the stage during her speech with a hand-held mic, not using a teleprompter.\n\n More than 1 million Michigan residents have already voted by mail in the Nov. 5 election, and Harris predicted that Detroit turnout for early voting would be strong. \n\n “Who is the capital of producing records?” Harris asked when imploring the crowd to set new highs for early voting tallies. “We are going to break some records here in Detroit today.” \n\n She slammed Trump as unstable: “Somebody just needs to watch his rallies, if you’re not really sure how to vote.” \n\n “We’re not going to get these 17 days back.

She also called Detroit “a great American city” with “a lot of hard-working folks that have grit and ambition and deserve to be respected.”\n\n The vice president was asked about whether the Biden administration’s full-throated support for Israel in its war with Hamas in Gaza might hurt her support in Michigan. Dearborn, near Detroit, is the largest city with an Arab majority in the nation.\n\n “It has never been easy,” Harris said of Middle East policy. “But that doesn’t mean we give up.”\n\n She will get more star power later Saturday when she holds a rally in Atlanta featuring another wildly popular singer, Usher.\n\n Early voting is also underway in Georgia. More than 1.2 million ballots have been cast, either in person or by mail.

It illustrates the long-term challenges faced by a hegemonic power as it plays a leading role in maintaining international order. The hegemon shoulders the burden of providing global public goods at great cost.\nOver time, however, the cost of sustaining the international status quo can exceed the benefits, creating a discrepancy between the hegemon’s power and its commitments. In such a situation, the hegemonic power can face the dilemma of balancing the provision of global public goods and constraints on its resources. The Gilpin dilemma also applies to the shifting influence in the international monetary system.\nThe 2024 US presidential election is likely to be one of the most fiercely contested in recent American history. This also fundamentally reflects the challenges the country faces in navigating its strategic choices amid the Gilpin dilemma.\nWhile both major political parties aim to preserve US hegemony and safeguard core national interests, their divergent strategies are likely to produce different outcomes. Democratic Party nominee and US Vice-President Kamala Harris is expected to largely continue US President Joe Biden’s multilateral approach, aiming to uphold the existing global order and maintain the role of public goods provider.\nIn contrast, the unilateralism of former US president Donald Trump – the Republican Party’s nominee – seeks to scale back this role, highlighting a divergence in strategies on how to sustain US hegemony. The provision of global public goods spans political, economic and military dimensions, but at its core lies the calculus of maintaining the dominance of the US dollar and maximising the benefits of the dollar’s status while managing the costs of upholding this position.\n\nFrom the perspective of foreign and military policy, Biden advocates strengthening international cooperation with allies and reinforcing the US position in global institutions. His aim is to preserve the stability of the global financial system and support the dollar-centric international monetary framework. In contrast, Trump favours reducing US engagement in international organisations and key agreements.\nWhile Biden’s positioning in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a defender of international justice and order has provided a boost to the US dollar’s standing, his reliance on sanctions and a perceived double standard over Israel’s conduct in its war in Gaza have somewhat undermined the effectiveness of these efforts.\nHowever, Biden’s diplomatic and military strategy is likely to be more favourable for maintaining the dollar’s global status in the long run, as political and military alliances are indispensable for the formation of today’s US dollar hegemony.\nIn terms of trade and economic policy, Harris is expected to broadly adhere to the major policy directions of the Biden administration while Trump’s campaign platform includes a pledge to “keep the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency”. Even so, his specific economic policy orientation could inadvertently undermine the dollar’s status.\n\nFirst, on the fiscal policy front, Biden’s revised fiscal budget proposes an additional reduction of about US$3 trillion in the federal deficit in the next 10 years. In contrast, Trump promises sweeping tax cuts without meaningful reductions to social security spending.\nHe also proposes a universal 10 per cent tariff on imported goods, a 60 per cent or higher tariff on imports from China and even a “100 per cent tariff” on countries moving away from using the US dollar. While these measures might temporarily boost demand for dollars by driving up inflation, they could also exacerbate the US debt burden and push more countries away from relying on the dollar.\nSecond, Trump’s stance on immigration is markedly tougher. While immigration policy might not directly affect the dollar’s global standing, it could indirectly undermine its position by affecting the country’s economic growth, technological innovation, international relations and global capital flows.\nThird, the Biden administration’s strategy to diversify supply chains, promote climate cooperation and advance technological innovation aims to uphold sustainable global economic development, thereby indirectly supporting the dollar’s international status.\nIn contrast, Trump’s rejection of climate change, staunch backing of the fossil fuel industry and withdrawal from the Paris climate accord undermine US leadership on these critical issues, indirectly weakening the dollar’s standing on the global stage.\n\nFourth, on the subject of cryptocurrency, Harris is expected to introduce a regulatory framework for digital assets such as bitcoin. On the other hand, Trump’s looser approach to regulation of cryptocurrencies could accelerate the trend towards decentralisation.\nOverall, the Democratic Party’s strategy is more forward-looking in terms of preserving US dollar hegemony and managing the strategy of public goods provision. However, for a hegemonic power facing the prospect of close elections and the Gilpin dilemma, such predictions are fraught with uncertainty, especially considering the dynamic nature of policies and the intricacies of their impact.\nFor instance, Trump’s tariffs might raise the cost of imported goods, but if the US remains committed to diversifying supply chains across the globe, this could also unlock stronger economic growth and improve the trade balance, thereby being beneficial to the dollar’s power.\nMeanwhile, Biden’s meticulous layout of sanctions and strategic moves in Russia’s war in Ukraine requires a high degree of control over the situation. If not handled deftly, it could ultimately have a weakening effect on the dollar’s standing.","summary":"While Democrats and Republicans aim to maintain core US interests, their plans could produce wildly different economic outcomes.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/opinion/world-opinion/article/3282577/how-harris-and-trump-will-seek-preserve-us-dollar-hegemony","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/10/17/497d800a-44fc-46a3-a5ba-46047a5fa161_b8714620.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-19 21:30:07","author":"Shanshan Li","authors":["Shanshan Li"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.374},{"id":260349316,"title":"Giovanni Pernice set to 'return to Strictly Come Dancing for 20th anniversary special' after being cleared of majority of bullying allegations in BBC probe","text":"Kim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSunday, Oct 20th 2024\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLiam didn't want to die, he didn't have to: Star had great plans for future and he should have been saved on the night of his death, says source close to family\n\nOlympic cycling legend Sir Chris Hoy reveals that his cancer is terminal - and he has just 'two to four years left'\n\nNew SNP chief was forced to apologise over sickening post attacking Kate and royals\n\nLauryn Goodman 'reported Kyle Walker's wife Annie Kilner to the police over shocking WhatsApp messages'\n\nAN WILSON: Why Charles should call the bluff of these drongo and ungracious Aussies and announce he'll quit as their head of state, by the late Queen's biographer\n\nLIZ JONES: I so wanted Meghan to be fulfilled.

It’ll be like Detroit,” the Republican presidential nominee said, painting the great Michigan city in a derogatory manner. “Our whole country will end up being like Detroit if she’s your president.”\n\n During Lizzo’s speech on Saturday, she said she had already voted early for Harris and encouraged others to get out early to vote, too.\n\n “They say voting is not a love letter, it’s a chess move,” Lizzo continued. “Well, I feel like voting early is not just a chess move, it’s a power move… There’s a lot of people who feel like their vote doesn’t matter, but I say to that: If your vote didn’t matter, then voter suppression would not exist. If your vote didn’t matter, they wouldn’t discourage young people from going to the polls. If your vote didn’t matter, our parents and our grandparents would not have marched and fought for our right to vote.”\n\n She added: “And also you live in the great state of Michigan. This is the swing state of all swing states. So every single last vote here counts.”\n\n Harris arrived onstage in a blazer and T-shirt that read “Detroit vs. Everybody,” which elicited cheers.\n\n Harris heads to Atlanta later on Saturday for another early vote event, where Usher will also appear.

The same Detroit that innovated the auto industry and the music industry. Put some respect on Detroit's name.'\n\nHer comments have since been blasted on social media after users pointed out that the city has been in a state of decay and decline for decades. \n\nOne person wrote: 'Regardless of Lizzo's strenuous efforts to spin it, all that will be ringing in people's subconscious is: \"Kamala will turn America into impoverished, run down, and unsafe, Detroit\".'\n\nAnother added: 'If Kamala is elected the whole country Will look like Detroit. A decimated car industry. A top ten city in crime statistics.'\n\nOne other commented: 'So Lizzo just told us the entire country will go to hell just like Detroit if we vote for Kamala!'\n\nAfter the clip was widely shared on X, another said: 'That was a Trump endorsement if I've ever had one. Lol.'\n\nThe singer burst into her song 'About Damn Time' during the event after those who gathered at the rally shouted out that they couldn't hear her. \n\nShe appeared with the Vice President to host an event urging those in Michigan to get out and vote as the city's first day of early voting started. \n\nHarris urged her supporters to put in an all-out effort aimed at winning on Election Day Nov. 5.\n\nShe said: 'And what I think we all know is, on Election Day, we don't want to have any regrets about what we could have done these next 17 days, and on November 5.'\n\nSpeaking with reporters, she added: 'Donald Trump has proven himself to be increasingly unstable and unfit and he is trying to take us backward.'\n\nDetroit had boasted around 1.8 million residents in the 1950s, but numbers shrunk as tens of thousands of white residents fled to the suburbs, followed years later by the Black middle class. \n\nThese hardships spilled over into the 21st century as the auto industry shrunk and jobs dried up. \n\nJust over a decade ago, the city filed for federal bankruptcy protection after a years-long financial crisis. \n\nWith debts topping $18 billion, the city could no longer pay its bills and was unable to provide basic services to its residents.\n\nThis sent thousands flocking elsewhere, and the city suffered an unprecedented population decline. Numbers fell to roughly 685,000 by the end of 2012.\n\nIn recent years however it is slowly starting to revitalize itself, with jobs more readily available and property prices climbing. \n\nThe city poured funds into infrastructure and building projects including the famous Michigan Central Station, which reopened in July after 30 years of laying vacant.\n\nIt was one regarded as one of the most violent cities in America but crime rates have slowly started to turn.\n\nThe city finished 2023 with 252 homicides, the fewest recorded since 1966, and a 16 percent drop in nonfatal shootings, according to the Detroit Police Department.","summary":"The singer, 36, who hails from Motor City, appeared alongside the Democratic presidential nominee at Western International High School in the city.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13978725/lizzo-america-kamala-harris-wins-donald-trump-election.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/10/19/21/91049923-0-image-m-44_1729368079681.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-19 21:11:26","author":"Editor,Joe Hutchison For","authors":["Editor","Joe Hutchison For"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"GB","sentiment":-0.341},{"id":260342074,"title":"Kamala Harris, Lizzo Praise Detroit Ahead of Atlanta Rally With Usher","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris appeared with Lizzo on Saturday (Oct. 19) in the singer’s hometown of Detroit, marking the beginning of in-person voting and lavishing the city with praise after Republican nominee Donald Trump recently disparaged it.\n\n “All the best things were made in Detroit.

Nevertheless, earlier in the year, both had cautioned Israel against entering Rafah, where Sinwar ultimately met his fate.\n\nSinwar oversaw the massacre of nearly 1,200 people Oct. 7, 2023, including over 40 American citizens.\n\nIn March, HarrisÂ declined to rule out âconsequencesâ for IsraelÂ if it moved forward with an invasion of Rafah in Gaza.\n\nâWe have been clear in multiple conversations and in every way that any major military operation in Rafah would be a huge mistake,â Harris told ABC News at the time.\n\nâLet me tell you something. I have studied the maps. Thereâs nowhere for those folks to go.â\n\nAlso in March, Biden National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan echoed HarrisÃ¢ÂÂ warning.Â \n\nâOur position is that Hamas should not be allowed a safe haven in Rafah or anywhere else,â Sullivan noted during a White House Press briefing.\n\nâBut a major ground operation there would be a mistake. It would lead to more innocent civilian deaths, worsen the already dire humanitarian crisis, deepen the anarchy in Gaza and further isolate Israel internationally.â\n\nIn May, Biden went as far asÂ threatening Israel,Â saying he would not furnish the Jewish state with weapons if it entered Rafah.\n\nBiden told CNN âif they go into Rafah, IÃ¢ÂÂm not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah, to deal with the cities Ã¢ÂÂ that deal with that problem.â\n\nAmit Segal, chief political analyst of Israelâs Channel 12, told Fox News Digital, âThe elimination of Sinwar proves that the continuation of the war was not a whim, the entry into Rafah was not a vendetta and the refusal to surrender to Hamas to resolve the northern front was not a rash decision.â\n\nHe continued, âThere is a strategy, and it is to ensure, front by front, that the entire Middle East sees what happens to those who attack Israel.â\n\nNew information emerged about the elimination of Sinwar Friday.\n\nAn IDF spokesman said âSinwarÃ¢ÂÂs main goal was to wipe Israel off the map. This operation achievement is one fragment out of a one-year endeavorâ in Gaza.Â \n\nHe said Sinwar was in the âsame tunnel where six hostages were executedâ in August.\n\nOne of the six hostages murdered wasÂ Israeli-American Hersh Goldberg-Polin. Â \n\nâWe understand Sinwar was in that area; a few hundred meters from that tunnel is where he was eliminated,â the IDF spokesman noted, adding there are âindications of senior Hamas leaders in Rafah area.â\n\nThere are 14,000 occurrences of Hamas booby-trapped buildings in the Rafah area, the IDF spokesman added.\n\nâHad Prime Minister Netanyahu listened to Biden and Harris and not entered Rafah, we may have never reached Sinwar. The people of America and Israel overwhelmingly supported our entry into Rafah and want to see Hamas committed to the annals of history. Now itâs time to finish Hamas and bring home the hostages,â Israeli Lt. Col (res) Yoni Chetboun, former deputy speaker of the Knesset and a decorated special forces operator, told Fox News Digital.\n\nHarrisÃ¢ÂÂ misjudgment about the ground war in Gaza sparked some intense criticism and ridicule on social media from foreign policy experts. American-Israeli Middle East expert Caroline Glick,Â wrote on X,Â âSinwar was killed in Rafah Ã¢ÂÂ a mile from the Egyptian border. Kamala threatened Israel with sanctions if we went in. Oh, and she studied the maps.âÂ \n\nThe campaign by the U.S. government and the European Union to rope in IsraelÃ¢ÂÂs push to eradicate the Iranian regime-backed terrorist movements, Hamas and Hezbollah, has so far not seemed to impact Netanyahuâs war plans.\n\nJosep Borrell, the left-wingÂ European UnionâsÂ foreign policy chief who suggested in February that theÂ United States slash military aid to Israel, said at the timeÂ there was no military solution to defeat Hamas.\n\nMax Abrahms, a leading expert on counterterrorism and a tenuredÂ professor of political science at Northeastern University, told Fox News Digital, âBiden and Harris have been basing their advice to Netanyahu on American political calculations. The White House is keenly aware that the Democratic Party has a strong anti-Israel constituency. For this reason, the White House has tried to coerce Netanyahu to withdraw Israeli forces from Gaza before the Hamas threat is fully handled and specifically against a Rafah operation.â\n\nâHad Netanyahu heeded that advice, Sinwar would be alive. Israel is safer for ignoring this White House, an important lesson as Netanyahu weighs military options against Iran.â\n\nFollowing news of Sinwarâs death, a reporter at theÂ State Department briefingÂ on Thursday asked Spokesman Matthew Miller whether the Biden Administrationâs policy towards Israel invading Rafah was in hindsight preemptive. Â \n\nIn his response, Miller said: âNo, I will say that we always made clear that we supported Israel conducting counterterrorism operations to target the leaders of Hamas and to target Hamas militants. And not only did we make clear we supported it, but we provided active intelligence support for those operations. And I think IÃ¢ÂÂll leave it at that.â\n\nFox News Digital press queries asking President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris whether they erred in their warnings to Netanyahu over Rafah were not returned.Â \n\nFox News DigitalÃ¢ÂÂs Anders Hagstrom contributed to this report.","summary":"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&#8217;s choice to disregard stark warnings from President&#8230;","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/experts-say-netanyahus-refusal-to-comply-with-biden-harris-warnings-about-invading-rafah-resulted-in-the-removal-of-sinwar/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/NetanyahuA¢AAs-defiance-of-Biden-Harris-Rafah-invasion-threats-led-to-elimination-800x430.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-19 21:01:45","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.002},{"id":260347852,"title":"Trump thinks 'the women' love him—except for this one tiny issue","text":"Trump popped in on “Fox & Friends” on Friday and dropped this gem: “Without abortion, the women love me.” \n\nYou almost have to give him a round of applause for nearly stumbling into a factual statement. Almost.\n\nHe’s partly correct: Women are mad that the Supreme Court’s conservative majority, half of which he appointed, overturned Roe v. Wade, eliminating the constitutional right to abortion. Like, throw-your-remote-at-the-TV mad. But “women love me”? Uh, no. \n\nThe polling data is clear: Women are not loving him. The latest New York Times/Siena College national poll shows a staggering 16-percentage-point gender gap between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris—and it’s not in his favor.\n\nWhy? For starters, abortion is the top issue for female voters under 30. And if Trump thought he could just fumble through an all-female town hall—one that Fox News stacked with MAGA supporters—and lip-service his way back onto women’s good side, think again. \n\nAnd now Trump is backtracking.\n\n“It’s going to be redone. They’re going to, you’re going to, you end up with a vote of the people,” Trump said on Tuesday. “They’re too tough, too tough. And those are going to be redone because already there’s a movement in those states.”\n\nBut it’s too late. \n\nAmber Thurman, whose death is linked to Georgia’s strict abortion ban, cannot be brought back to life. Her son will have to live without his mother forever. And women in Texas are forced to carry ectopic pregnancies, thereby compromising their future fertility. A teenager forced to carry a child conceived by sexual assault to term will live with that trauma for the rest of her life.\n\nMeanwhile, even former first lady Melania Trump disagrees with her husband. In promoting her memoir, she vaguely asserted her belief in abortion rights—which is convenient timing, of course, coming about a month before the presidential election.\n\nAnd let’s not forget a primary demographic that helped put him in the White House in 2016: working-class white women, specifically those in the suburbs. In 2024, they are again key to a Trump victory. His mistake to help overturn Roe could cost him dearly, and he seems to know it. \n\nSo while he’s frequently canceling interviews outside of his safe space, Harris is going into the Fox’s den, working a tight ground game, vowing to enshrine the protections of Roe into law, and mobilizing women to turn out at the ballot box. \n\nVolunteer to reach young voters and prepare them to get out to the polls so we can beat Trump!

I have studied the maps. There’s nowhere for those folks to go.”\n\nAlso in March, Biden National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan echoed Harris’ warning. \n\n“Our position is that Hamas should not be allowed a safe haven in Rafah or anywhere else,” Sullivan noted during a White House Press briefing. \n\n“But a major ground operation there would be a mistake. It would lead to more innocent civilian deaths, worsen the already dire humanitarian crisis, deepen the anarchy in Gaza and further isolate Israel internationally.”\n\nIn May, Biden went as far as threatening Israel, saying he would not furnish the Jewish state with weapons if it entered Rafah. \n\nBiden told CNN “if they go into Rafah, I’m not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah, to deal with the cities — that deal with that problem.”\n\nAmit Segal, chief political analyst of Israel’s Channel 12, told Fox News Digital, “The elimination of Sinwar proves that the continuation of the war was not a whim, the entry into Rafah was not a vendetta and the refusal to surrender to Hamas to resolve the northern front was not a rash decision.”\n\nHe continued, “There is a strategy, and it is to ensure, front by front, that the entire Middle East sees what happens to those who attack Israel.”\n\nNew information emerged about the elimination of Sinwar Friday. \n\nAn IDF spokesman said “Sinwar’s main goal was to wipe Israel off the map. This operation achievement is one fragment out of a one-year endeavor” in Gaza. \n\nHe said Sinwar was in the “same tunnel where six hostages were executed” in August.\n\nOne of the six hostages murdered was Israeli-American Hersh Goldberg-Polin. \n\n“We understand Sinwar was in that area; a few hundred meters from that tunnel is where he was eliminated,” the IDF spokesman noted, adding there are “indications of senior Hamas leaders in Rafah area.”\n\nThere are 14,000 occurrences of Hamas booby-trapped buildings in the Rafah area, the IDF spokesman added.\n\n“Had Prime Minister Netanyahu listened to Biden and Harris and not entered Rafah, we may have never reached Sinwar. The people of America and Israel overwhelmingly supported our entry into Rafah and want to see Hamas committed to the annals of history. Now it’s time to finish Hamas and bring home the hostages,” Israeli Lt. Col (res) Yoni Chetboun, former deputy speaker of the Knesset and a decorated special forces operator, told Fox News Digital.\n\nHarris’ misjudgment about the ground war in Gaza sparked some intense criticism and ridicule on social media from foreign policy experts. American-Israeli Middle East expert Caroline Glick, wrote on X, “Sinwar was killed in Rafah — a mile from the Egyptian border. Kamala threatened Israel with sanctions if we went in. Oh, and she studied the maps.” \n\nThe campaign by the U.S. government and the European Union to rope in Israel’s push to eradicate the Iranian regime-backed terrorist movements, Hamas and Hezbollah, has so far not seemed to impact Netanyahu’s war plans.\n\nJosep Borrell, the left-wing European Union’s foreign policy chief who suggested in February that the United States slash military aid to Israel, said at the time there was no military solution to defeat Hamas.\n\nMax Abrahms, a leading expert on counterterrorism and a tenured professor of political science at Northeastern University, told Fox News Digital, “Biden and Harris have been basing their advice to Netanyahu on American political calculations. The White House is keenly aware that the Democratic Party has a strong anti-Israel constituency. For this reason, the White House has tried to coerce Netanyahu to withdraw Israeli forces from Gaza before the Hamas threat is fully handled and specifically against a Rafah operation.”\n\n“Had Netanyahu heeded that advice, Sinwar would be alive. Israel is safer for ignoring this White House, an important lesson as Netanyahu weighs military options against Iran.”\n\nFollowing news of Sinwar’s death, a reporter at the State Department briefing on Thursday asked Spokesman Matthew Miller whether the Biden Administration’s policy towards Israel invading Rafah was in hindsight preemptive. \n\nIn his response, Miller said: “No, I will say that we always made clear that we supported Israel conducting counterterrorism operations to target the leaders of Hamas and to target Hamas militants. And not only did we make clear we supported it, but we provided active intelligence support for those operations. And I think I’ll leave it at that.”\n\nFox News Digital press queries asking President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris whether they erred in their warnings to Netanyahu over Rafah were not returned. \n\nFox News Digital’s Anders Hagstrom contributed to this report.","summary":"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s decision to ignore dire warnings from President Biden and Vice President Harris not to conquer the last major stronghold of Hamas terrorists in Rafah proved to be correct.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/10/19/world-news/netanyahus-defiance-of-biden-harris-rafah-invasion-threats-led-to-elimination-of-sinwar-experts-say/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/91959171.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/arPFdAbo-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-10-19 20:45:47","author":"Fox News","authors":["Fox News"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.071},{"id":260345632,"title":"Harris and Trump court early voters; Usher, Lizzo join campaign trail - Reuters","text":"SummaryCompaniesHarris campaigns in Detroit with Lizzo, in Atlanta with UsherLizzo says it is 'about damn time' for a woman presidentTrump stages rally in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, amid deadlockedraceObama to campaign for Harris in Nevada as early voting starts\n\nATLANTA/LATROBE, Pennsylvania, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump hit the campaign trail on Saturday, pressing their case with voters from Georgia to Pennsylvania who are already starting to cast ballots in the U.S. presidential election.\n\nHarris and Trump are essentially tied in the most competitive states and many Americans are voting early by mail or in person, with just 17 days until the Nov. 5 election.\n\nOn Saturday, Harris rallied supporters at a get-out-the-vote event in Detroit, Michigan, for the city's first day of early voting, alongside Detroit-born rapper Lizzo, who said voting was crucial in a state where thin margins can determine elections.\n\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\n\n\"This is the swing state of all swing states, so every single last vote here counts,\" Lizzo said.

Coney dogs, Faygo and Lizzo,” the singer joked to a rally crowd, pointing to herself after listing off the meat-on-a-stick and soda that the city is famous for. She said it was time to “put some respect on Detroit’s name,” noting that the city had revolutionized the auto and music industries and adding that she'd already cast her ballot for Harris, since voting early was “a power move.” Heaps of praise for the Motor City came after Trump, the former president, insulted Detroit during a recent campaign stop. And Harris continued the theme, saying of her campaign, \"Like the people of Detroit, we have grit, we have excellence, we have history.” Arms wide open as she took the stage, Harris let the crowd see she was wearing under her blazer a “Detroit vs. Everybody” T-shirt that the owner of the business that produces them gave her during another stop in the city earlier in the week. She moved around the stage during her speech with a hand-held mic, not using a teleprompter. More than 1 million Michigan residents have already voted by mail in the Nov. 5 election, and Harris predicted that Detroit turnout for early voting would be strong. “Who is the capital of producing records?\" Harris asked when imploring the crowd to set new highs for early voting tallies. \"We are going to break some records here in Detroit today.” She slammed Trump as unstable: “Somebody just needs to watch his rallies, if you’re not really sure how to vote.” “We’re not going to get these 17 days back. On election day, we don’t want to have any regrets,\" the vice president said. Lizzo also told the crowd, \"Mrs. Commander-in-Chief has a nice ring to it.” “This is the swing state of all swing states, so every last vote here counts,\" the singer said. Then, referencing her song of the same title, Lizzo added, “If you ask me if America is ready for its first woman president, I only have one thing to say: It’s about damn time!” Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley said in a statement that Harris needed Lizzo “to hide the fact that Michiganders were feeling good under President Trump — real wages were higher, prices were lower, and everyone was better off.” Talona Johnson, a product manager from Rochester, Mich., attended Harris rally and said that the Democrat “and her team are doing the things that are required to make sure that people are informed.\" “I believe she’s telling the truth. She’s trying to help the people,\" said Johnson, who said she planned to vote for Harris and named women’s rights as her top concern. \"I don’t necessarily agree with everything that she’s put out, but she’s better than the alternative.\" In comments to reporters before the rally, Harris said she was in Detroit “to thank all the folks for the work they are doing to help organize and register people to vote, and get them out to vote today.\" She also called Detroit “a great American city” with “a lot of hardworking folks that have grit and ambition and deserve to be respected.” Harris was asked about whether the Biden administration's staunch support for Israel in its war with Hamas in Gaza might hurt her support in Michigan. Dearborn, near Detroit, is the largest U.S. city with an Arab majority. “It has never been easy,\" Harris said of Middle East policy. \"But that doesn’t mean we give up.” She will get more star power later Saturday when she holds a rally in Atlanta featuring another popular singer, Usher. Early voting is also underway in Georgia. More than 1.2 million ballots have been cast, either in person or by mail.

[+] Resch Expo in Green Bay, Wis., Thursday, Oct. 17, 2024. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.\n\nHealthcare remains an important issue to voters, second only to the economy, according to Pew Research. But arguably, the President of the United States has less control over the economy than healthcare. After all, the economy is subject to the vagaries of market forces, both domestically and internationally, that are often outside the purview of any given Administration. Yet the federal government can have direct impact on healthcare through the programs it finances, such as Medicare and Medicaid, but also laws it implements like the Affordable Care and Inflation Reduction Acts. Stark differences in policy have emerged between the campaigns of Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump that would impact patient’s access to healthcare.\n\nA recent New England Journal of Medicine article suggests that the November election could have important implications for patients’ access to healthcare, whether it be through changes to the ACA and other laws, expansion of Medicaid—the government health insurance program for people with limited income and resources—or the addition of benefits for seniors and disabled folks enrolled in Medicare.\n\nThe Harris campaign has announced a series of proposals to expand government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid and extend the reach of certain provisions currently only applicable in the public realm to the private insurance sector. The Trump campaign hasn’t been as forthcoming. It’s hard to glean much about “concepts of a plan,” which Trump mentioned at the presidential debate, other than rough contours of what could be the former president’s intentions regarding healthcare.\n\nIf Harris wins, it’s likely to result in a continuation of policies led by the Biden Administration, including the bolstering of the ACA through the American Rescue Plan and Inflation Reduction Acts. Or, a Trump victory could produce policy reversals, including possible disruptions to the ACA, as hinted at by Trump and his running mate, JD Vance.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Harris has spoken of the need to expand Medicare to cover dental, vision and hearing benefits. She also trumpets the Biden Administration’s record on reducing levels of uninsured to their lowest in history and decreasing Medicare beneficiary out-of-pocket costs for prescription medications through provisions included in the Inflation Reduction Act. Beginning next year, for example, Medicare beneficiaries will have a $2,000 annual cap on out-of-pocket costs for outpatient prescription drugs. And the cost of insulin has already been capped at $35 per month for Medicare recipients, which Harris now wants all Americans with insurance to benefit from.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nWhat To Know About Liam Payne’s Death: Cowell, Cole And Shawn Mendes React\n\nMicrosoft Windows Deadline—10 Days To Update Or Stop Using Your PC\n\nTesla Cybertruck Gets Massive Price Cut For Both AWD And Cyberbeast\n\nAlso, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services negotiated the prices of ten top-selling prescription drugs. In late August, the agency released what it calls maximum fair prices for the therapeutics, to be implemented in January 2026. Furthermore, CMS will select 15 more pharmaceuticals for negotiation in February 2025. Harris intends to build on the Medicare negotiation policy to include more drugs if she becomes president, though this would likely encounter Congressional hurdles.\n\nHarris has also outlined a plan to expand Medicare coverage of home healthcare for seniors, including specific ways to potentially fund the new program from projected savings the government could achieve from negotiating lower drug prices.\n\nIn addition, the Democratic presidential candidate has spoken of tackling medical debt by building on existing federal efforts to assist some of the 100 million people struggling with this financial burden. Moreover, Harris views more comprehensive insurance coverage that reduces patients’ out-of-pocket costs as providing the best defense against going into debt in future.\n\nAnd Harris has stated that she seeks to rein in drug patent abuses and alleged anti-competitive practices by both pharmaceutical manufacturers and pharmacy benefit managers, who managed prescription drug benefits for clients that include Medicare and Medicaid. Her positions are consistent with the Federal Trade Commission Chair, Lina Khan, a Biden Administration appointee.\n\nTrump’s “Concepts Of A Plan”\n\nSince running for a second term as president Trump has wavered on a number of healthcare-related issues. In January, for example, Trump repeated his pledge to repeal the ACA before backtracking, asserting in a post on Truth Social that instead he wanted to make the ACA “better.” Indeed, now he and other Republicans claim they want to improve the healthcare program.\n\nTrump hasn’t divulged details on how he wants to go about this, but his running mate has provided a few hints. Vance says there is a plan to “fix healthcare,” specifically with respect to the ACA. He has argued that the health insurance market needs to be deregulated and spoke of placing people with chronic conditions into separate insurance pools. But this could lead to insurers charging higher premiums for individuals with pre-existing conditions.\n\nIt’s curious that the Trump campaign has mostly backed away from outlining healthcare initiatives that would impact patient access, because as president Trump certainly had more than just a concept of a plan. His Administration was actively involved in trying to reshape healthcare.\n\nAs president, Trump didn’t seek to expand Medicare’s standard benefits to include vision, dental and hearing. However, the Trump Administration promoted private options for beneficiaries through Medicare Advantage plans, which often include extra benefits such as vision, dental and hearing.\n\nAlso, the Trump Administration was opposed to Medicaid expansion. Instead, it opted to rely on Section 1115 Medicaid demonstration waivers which offer states a pathway to test new approaches that differ from what is required by federal statute. Under Trump, CMS approved a range of demonstrations that included eligibility restrictions and work requirements for Medicaid beneficiaries.\n\nAnd under the former president’s watch, the Department of Health and Human Services proposed government-led measures aimed at reducing Medicare beneficiary out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs at the pharmacy counter. To illustrate, Trump issued executive orders aimed squarely at PBMs, attempting to force the intermediaries to pass through rebates to Medicare recipients at the point of sale. These efforts failed to get implemented.\n\nTrump also signed executive orders that would have instituted a “most favored nations” drug pricing policy, which would have required pharmaceutical firms to sell certain drugs to Medicare for the lowest price that they offer to a number of comparable nations in terms of per capita gross domestic product. These actions by Trump also didn’t go anywhere.\n\nThe use of such international price referencing for prescription drugs was staunchly opposed by many fellow Republicans. After reiterating his pursuit of a most favored nations policy in a second term earlier this year, Trump has now apparently backed off this proposal.\n\nExpanding the scope of healthcare to include the reproductive rights issue, at the direction of Trump the Republican platform in 2024 abandoned a federal abortion ban plank, instead ceding restrictions to the states which is in line with the decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. Trump has personally taken many different positions over time, making it unclear for voters to judge where he currently stands. On the other hand, Harris vows to codify Roe v. Wade through a Congressional act, which would aim to guarantee abortion rights nationwide.\n\nFrom what can be gathered from campaign speeches and policy statements, Party platforms and what occurred during the Trump Administration, sharply delineated differences in policy positions have come to light between Harris and Trump that would impact patient access to healthcare. The Harris campaign has promulgated a set of detailed proposals to expand government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid and extend the reach of certain measures presently only applicable in the public realm to the private insurance sector. On the other hand, the Trump campaign messages on healthcare have been more ambiguous or completely missing in action. The only thing that’s known is that under Trump disruptions to the ACA are possible, as is experimentation in Medicaid through state-based pilot projects that strictly limit enrollee eligibility.\n\nFollow me on Twitter. \n\nJoshua P.

Hezbollah has also been designated terror group by the United States, while the EU blacklists its armed wing but not its political unit, which has members in the Lebanese parliament.\n\nHamas, Lebanon-based Hezbollah, and the Huthi rebels in Yemen -- also deemed a terrorist organization by the United States -- are considered Iranian proxy organizations in the Middle East.\n\nFollowing its summit in Italy, the G7 -- the United States, Italy, Canada, Britain, France, and Japan -- said it remains \"united in supporting the need for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza,\" the release of all hostages, and a \"significant and sustained increase\" in the flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza.\n\nThe statement also said the G7 is troubled by the latest events in Lebanon and \"the risk of further escalation.\"\n\nIt expressed concerns over \"all threats\" to the security of the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), which has complained of dangers to its staff amid the Israeli military's air and ground operations in southern Lebanon near the Israeli border.\n\nSeparately, U.S. defense chief Lloyd Austin said Washington would \"like to see\" Israel scale back some of its attacks in and around Beirut.\n\n\"The number of civilian causalities have been far too high. We would like to see Israel scale back some of the strikes in and around Beirut and we would like to see a transition to negotiations that would allow civilians on both sides to return to their homes,\" he said following the G7 summit in Naples.\n\nU.S. Vice President Kamala Harris on October 19 said the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar presented an opportunity for a cease-fire in the Middle East.\n\n\"This creates an opening that I believe we must take full advantage of to dedicate ourselves to ending this war and bringing the hostages home,\" Harris told reporters.\n\n\"As it relates to the issues in the Middle East and in particular in that region, it has never been easy. But that doesn't mean we give up. It's always going to be difficult.\"\n\nThe statements come after Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Hamas \"will remain alive\" despite the death of Sinwar.\n\nKhamenei said in a statement on October 19 that Sinwar's \"loss is undoubtedly painful for the Axis of Resistance,\" referring to a self-described network of several Iran-backed groups in the Middle East, including Hamas.\n\n\"But this front did not cease advancing with the martyrdom of prominent figures,\" Khamenei added.\n\nSinwar -- the architect of the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel that triggered the war in Gaza -- was killed by Israeli forces on October 16. His death was confirmed by a top Hamas political official the following day.\n\nThe situation remains tense in Gaza, where at least 50 people including children were killed in Israeli air strikes on October 19, Palestinian health officials said.\n\nAt least 10 of them were killed in central Gaza when a house was hit in the town of Zawayda, according to the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, where the casualties were taken.\n\nAnother attack killed 11 people, all from the same family, in the Maghazi refugee camp, according to the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah.\n\nThe Israeli government said that a drone was launched toward the house of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the coastal town of Caesarea on October 19, with no casualties. Neither Netanyahu nor his wife were home, his office said in a statement.\n\nNetanyahu later said that the \"agents of Iran who attempted to assassinate\" him and his wife \"made a bitter mistake.\"\n\nThe drone strike came in the morning as sirens wailed in Israel, warning of incoming fire from Lebanon.\n\nIn Lebanon, authorities said two people were killed in an Israeli strike on October 19 in Jounieh, north of Beirut.\n\nJounieh, a Christian-majority town, had not been hit since Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah started exchanging cross-border fire over the Gaza war last year.\n\nIsrael intensified its bombardment of Lebanon on September 23 and later in the month sent ground troops across the Lebanese border.\n\nThe strikes have reached areas outside of traditional strongholds of Hezbollah, which is designated as a terrorist organization by the United States, while the European Union blacklists its armed wing but not its political party.\n\nHezbollah's political wing has seats in the Lebanese parliament and the militants control the southern part of the country that borders Israel.\n\nElsewhere, pro-Iranian groups in Iraq overran offices of Saudi broadcaster MBC after it aired a report referring to commanders of Tehran-linked militant groups as \"terrorists.\"\n\nMore than 400 people \"wrecked the electronic equipment, the computers, and set fire to a part of the building,\" an Iraqi Interior Ministry source told AFP.\n\nThe source said the fire had been put out and that police had dispersed the crowd.\n\nWith reporting by AP, AFP, and
