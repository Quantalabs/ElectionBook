The next highest spender was Republican candidate Steve Hilton, who spent $3.8 million. The top-spending Democrat candidate in the race behind Steyer is former U.S. Rep. Katie Porter, who dropped just under $3 million last year.\n\nPorter and current Rep. Eric Swalwell have tied in recent polling. Steyer has trailed behind them but has climbed in popularity since his initial entrance into the race. Swalwell spent less than $700,000 last year, according to his committee’s campaign filing. He reported $2.6 million still in his warchest, while Porter reported $3.2 million. Former Los Angeles Mayor and California Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa reported having $3.6 million on hand, and former U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra held $3.8 million.\n\nThe numbers are strikingly low for a campaign for an open governor’s seat, longtime Democratic strategist Garry South told The Sacramento Bee. “Other than Steyer these candidates are raising money at about the rate you would expect in a state senate race,” he said.\n\nAs of December 30, there were more than 23 million registered California voters, according to Secretary of State data. Making your pitch in a pool of that size is an expensive task, South said. “It’s a huge, huge constituency you have to appeal to,” he said. But even in that environment, Steyer’s considerable spending hasn’t helped the billionaire pull ahead in the polling in any significant way South noted.\n\nSteyer had drawn his account down to $1.9 million by the end of last year. But he has the ability to rapidly refill it with a self donation, as he did in November, when he cut a $20 million check to start his campaign.\n\nA spokesperson for Steyer did not provide a comment by publication time about how much the financier is willing to spend to become governor.\n\nSome of the lackluster fundraising by other candidates could be because donors are hesitant to compete in a race where Steyer is so far dominating in spending on ads, longtime political consultant Steve Maviglio said in a phone interview with The Sacramento Bee\n\n“They’re wiped out by the stroke of a pen from Tom Steyer,” Maviglio said. “It’s chilling the ability to fundraise for a lot of people.”\n\nPolitical action committees have also yet to begin any major independent expenditures in the governor’s race opposing or supporting candidates on behalf of corporations, labor unions and other special interests. Those committees tend to open up their considerable arsenals closer to election day, which in the case of the gubernatorial race’s open primary comes June 2.\n\nOver the past few months a series of high profile politicians — namely former Vice President Kamala Harris, current California Attorney General Rob Bonta and U.S. Senator Alex Padilla — all surfaced as possible candidates who would have entered the race with powerful support networks behind them, only to ultimately bow out of running. That’s left some of the usual wealthy campaign donors unsure of what candidate to back, Maviglio said.\n\n“No one has really made a breakout move in the money, and I think that’s tied to no one has made a breakout move in the polls,” he said.\n\nAnother major unknown in the spending game is San Jose Mayor Matt Mahan. The mayor only announced his entrant into the race last week, and did not file any campaign finance reports. But Mahan, running from the heart of Silicon Valley with the backing of wealthy tech businesspeople — he also has the support of Los Angeles billionaire Rick Caruso — is likely to bring a fresh flood of spending into the campaign.\n\nSteyer has already sought to distinguish his independent funding from Mahan’s campaign. “California needs a governor who will stand up to powerful interests, not carry their water,” a Steyer spokesperson said last week, responding to Mahan’s announcement.\n\nWith just four months to race, Mahan doesn’t have time to hold a lot of fundraisers or meetings and phone calls to raise money himself, South said. If the mayor is going to make a break through in the race at this point, it will likely come through deep-pocketed political action committees funded by tech billionaires, South said.\n\nSteyer has unleashed a flood of videos advertising his positions, which notably, given his heavy spending, include calling for a ban on campaign giving by corporations and reigning in electrical utility companies to lower costs for Californians. The billionaire has mounted his campaign on economic issues, pitching voters on the idea that as an outsider without ties to special interests he can push changes through Sacramento to lower California’s cost of living.","url":"https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article314565734.html","image":"https://www.sacbee.com/public/latest-news/iwzvol/picture314240786/alternates/FREE_1140/SAC_0343_PK_20260107_STEYER.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-04 01:27:59","author":"Andrew Graham","authors":["Andrew Graham"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.023},{"id":399107384,"title":"New Jersey special election will test the sway of Democrats' machine politics: From the Politics Desk","text":"This is the online version of From the Politics Desk, a daily newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team’s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail.

On the Republican side, Joe Hathaway, who is the mayor of suburban Randolph, is running unopposed. In the general election — which will be held in April — he will be the prohibitive underdog. The 11th District, which takes in parts of three North Jersey counties, backed Kamala Harris by 9 points in the 2024 presidential election and went for Sherrill by 15 in the governor’s race. Add in the fact that Democrats have been consistently and significantly overperforming in special elections since President Donald Trump returned to the White House, the odds are that it will be Thursday’s Democratic primary where the district’s next representative will be chosen. A dozen names will appear on the Democratic ballot, but only a few are seen as having a realistic chance. The official Democratic organizations in the district’s component counties have all opted to back different candidates. Machine politics have long been a driving factor for New Jersey Democrats, with strong county party organizations endorsing candidates and muscling them to victory with turnout armies and choice positions on the ballot — known as “the line.” That power was weakened considerably when a court struck down that ballot design two years ago. Now, all candidates are grouped together on the ballot, though county parties can still designate their endorsed candidate. Exactly how much sway organizational endorsements still carry in New Jersey is unclear — and this primary will provide a useful data point. In the old days, Brendan Gill, an Essex County commissioner, would be the clear favorite, with official party support in what is the district’s largest component county. He still has some significant advantages, with a host of local Essex leaders backing him and experience winning countywide elections. He also chairs the local Democratic Party in Montclair. A bastion of liberal activism and the single largest vote-producing municipality in the district, it should account for close to 10% of all votes cast. Then there’s Tom Malinowski, who represented the neighboring 7th District in Congress from 2018 to 2022, when he was defeated by Republican Thomas Kean. Malinowski could have sought a rematch this year with Kean but was attracted to the more solidly Democratic 11th District. Malinowski has the party organization’s support in Morris County, although even in the heyday of party machines, Morris had a weak Democratic infrastructure. Until recently, it was a strongly Republican county. What Malinowski really has going for him is broad name recognition and particular appeal to the highly engaged and machine-phobic professional class that is ascendant in the Democratic Party. An endorsement from Sen. Andy Kim, who filed the lawsuit that killed off the state’s old ballot design two years ago, has only burnished those credentials. In a nod to Malinowski’s strength, both outside groups and Gill’s campaign have targeted him with negative ads and phone calls. By far the smallest part of the district is in Passaic County, where the Democratic organization essentially decided to punt, offering its support to both Tahesha Way, who had been lieutenant governor under former Gov. Phil Murphy, and John Bartlett, a Passaic County commissioner. That joint endorsement may not help either much, but Way is also benefitting from a flood of outside spending, especially from the Democratic Lieutenant Governors Association, which has spent well over $1 million on TV ads for her. The large-scale outside expenditures against Malinowski and for Way have added uncertainty to the race. The wild card in the race is Analilia Mejia, a progressive organizer who was the political director for Bernie Sanders’ 2020 presidential campaign. She has the backing of both Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Mejia is positioning herself as an outsider, and her left-wing brand of politics could have considerable resonance with the Trump-era Democratic base. After Republicans push Clintons to testify on Epstein, Democrats warn they’ll haul in Trump By Scott Wong, Melanie Zanona, Sahil Kapur and Ryan Nobles Facing the threat of being held in contempt of Congress, Bill and Hillary Clinton agreed to testify before the House Oversight Committee about convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Democrats now say Republicans have established a new precedent when it comes to Congress’ ability to subpoena and haul in past presidents, first ladies and family members under threat of criminal charges if they refuse — a precedent they warn the GOP and Oversight Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., will soon regret. “We are absolutely going to have Donald Trump testify under oath” when Democrats take back power, California Rep. Ted Lieu, a member of Democratic leadership, told NBC News. Rep. Maxwell Frost, D-Fla., a young progressive who serves on the Oversight panel, said Democrats “100%” will take advantage of the new precedent set by Republicans. “It does set a precedent, and we will follow it. ... Donald Trump, all of his kids. Everybody,” Frost said. Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wis., agreed with his colleagues: “This will make Donald Trump happy in the short term, but in the long term, a year from now, we have subpoena power.” He warned: “What goes around comes around.” The background: The House was set to move forward this week with a vote to hold the Clintons in contempt of Congress after they refused to comply with a subpoena for their testimony in the panel’s Epstein investigation. The vote was expected to be bipartisan, with some Democrats saying they would vote alongside Republicans. Seeing the writing on the wall, the Clintons agreed to testify before the committee. Comer said the Clintons will appear before his committee Feb. 26 and 27 “for transcribed, filmed depositions,” though the Clintons’ attorney said the former first couple would prefer to appear in public. The two sides are engaged in a standoff over the format of the interview. Read more → That’s all From the Politics Desk for now.

It is not controversial by party, and it is not controversial by race,” Enten explained.\n\n“The vast majority of Americans agree with Nicki Minaj that, in factm you should have a photo ID to be able to vote,” Enten said, vindicating the star rapper who drew liberal backlash Sunday when she touted the photo ID requirement in a social media post:\n\n“What sensible forward thinking cutting edge leading nation is having a DEBATE on whether or not there should be VOTER ID?!?!!!!

Donald Trump beat Kamala Harris by 26 points there in 2024.\n\nSpecifically, the government told the Hanover officials that it wanted to build out the facility on a former cattle farm, where there is now a 500,000-square-foot warehouse constructed by a company owned by Canadian billionaire Jim Pattison.\n\nAfter hearing from residents in deep-red Hanover Country, the board of supervisors announced that it would oppose the sale.\n\nPattison’s company intended to sell that warehouse to ICE. But after the news about that plan became public, the Canadians got going.\n\nThe head of the Green Party in British Columbia announced a boycott of all the companies owned or operated by Pattison if he went through with the plan. Days later, the union representing workers at Pattison’s grocery stores also raised concerns about the sale.\n\nIn response, Pattison’s company put out a milquetoast statement thanking people for their concern but essentially vowing to move ahead with the sale.\n\nThe next day, a big advertising company sent a letter notifying Pattison that it would “suspend all media buying” with the billionaire’s businesses due to the deal.\n\nThat night, back in Virginia, the Hanover County Board of Supervisors held a meeting about the facility. The place was absolutely packed with locals, and the public comment period went on for hours.\n\nThere were so many people there, in the cold and snow, that once the room was full, residents were queued up outside. They knew they wouldn’t get in, but they refused to leave.\n\nAt the end of that meeting, after hearing from residents in deep-red Hanover County, the board of supervisors announced that it would oppose the sale and called on the residents’ state representatives and federal delegation in Congress to take action.\n\nThen, less than 48 hours later, Pattison’s company put out a one-line statement: “The transaction to sell our industrial building in Ashland, Virginia will not be proceeding.”\n\nThis isn’t just happening in Virginia. In the past couple of weeks, residents in Salt Lake City have also banded together to stop another huge warehouse from being turned into a prison camp.\n\nOrganizers there focused their attention on a real estate company trying to broker the sale of that warehouse and protested at their local offices.\n\nThe county’s mayor even got involved, noting that the facility would hold more people than all the state prisons in Utah. She pledged to use “all available legal and policy avenues, including land-use authority, regulatory review, and coordination with local partners” to oppose it.\n\nOn Saturday, the real estate group that owns the warehouse put out a brief, to-the-point statement, writing it had “no plans” to sell or lease the building to ICE or any other federal government agency.\n\nIn Oklahoma, the local government in Durant passed a resolution that it will not allow ICE to have a facility there. In Oklahoma City, protests led the mayor to stop the sale of a similar project.\n\nThere are variations of this happening everywhere. From San Antonio, Texas, to Merrimack, New Hampshire, to Social Circle, Georgia, people are telling the administration they do not want ICE prison camps in their communities.\n\nOn Monday in Maryland, Howard County Executive Calvin Ball revoked the building permit for an ICE facility that the government planned to build there.\n\n“As we continue to witness the devastating consequences of federal enforcement actions across our nation, including loss of life and civil unrest, it is more important than ever that local government acts with clarity, restraint and compassion,” Ball said. “It is our responsibility as local leaders to act before harm occurs and not after.”\n\nNow, if the federal government wants to construct these camps on military bases or other land it already has control over, there’s very little leverage to stop them. But people can still show up and protest the heck out of those facilities.\n\nOver the last few days, demonstrations were held outside a facility in Dilley, Texas, where the government is holding men, women and children. \n\nLast week, the prisoners inside that facility revolted in peaceful protest when they heard about the unrest nationwide over what has happened in Minneapolis.\n\nThat facility is also where 5-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos was held after being sent there from Minneapolis, before a judge over the weekend ordered him and his father freed and sent home. But hundreds of other kids are still being held there, where the government now admits there is a measles outbreak.\n\nIf they build them, they will fill them up. \n\nPeople have also been protesting at Camp East Montana, which is located on the Fort Bliss military base in El Paso, Texas. At least three people have died there in just the past two months, including a man whose death has been ruled a homicide by the local medical examiner.\n\nUnder the existing system, the administration is already holding more than 73,000 detainees, and the 16 new processing facilities and seven huge warehouse facility camps that it wants to build will give it space to more than double that number.\n\nCamp East Montana, the largest of these current facilities, holds about 3,000 people. But the administration wants the new centers to house closer to 10,000 people.\n\nIf they build them, they will fill them up.\n\nIf history tells us anything, it’s that once facilities like this are built in these kinds of numbers, while they may start as immigration detention centers, they are available to the government to use indefinitely for whatever it wants to do.\n\nBut everywhere they are trying to build these things, including in some of the country’s reddest states, people are pulling out all the stops to prevent them from being built. And if the country stops the government from building them, it will never again have this kind of momentum to try to construct a constellation of prison camps outside the reach of the law.\n\nAllison Detzel contributed.","url":"https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/americans-protest-ice-detention-facilities-trump-mass-deportation","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/msnow/images/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630/f_auto,q_auto/v1770141167/260203-ice-facility-protests-zz_11659962d99b_11659969ef17/260203-ice-facility-protests-zz_11659962d99b_11659969ef17.jpg?_i=AA","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-03 21:33:01","author":"Ja’han Jones","authors":["Ja’han Jones"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.432},{"id":399103322,"title":"When Vogue Becomes Vomit","text":"My amazing wife and I just returned from seeing the new documentary, Melania, and both of us came away from the experience respecting the First Lady more than we already did beforehand. The grace, fierce determination, charm, and class Mrs. Trump has shown since being thrust back into the national spotlight has been inspiring to see. And that's not fawning. That's just obvious by looking at her first year in office. Yes, First Ladies have terms, too, where they're supposed to do something constructive for the country. The closing credits of the film listed accomplishments of the first year of the First Lady's second term. Paraphrased, it goes like this: \n\nChampioning and passage of the Take It Down Act (federal legislation criminalizing non-consensual publication of intimate images online, including AI-generated/deepfakes, with a focus on protecting children and victims).Signing/implementation of an Executive Order on \"Fostering the Future for American Children & Families\" (supporting foster youth transitions through education, employment, housing, mentoring, and related programs, including $25 million in funding/partnerships via HUD).Launching the Presidential AI Challenge and a National K-12 AI Program (encouraging students to develop AI solutions for community issues).Hosting a White House Task Force/Roundtable on AI Education.Efforts to reunite Ukrainian and Russian children/families (tied to broader world peace and child welfare advocacy amid the ongoing conflict).Launching a global coalition (\"Fostering the Future Together\") at the UN General Assembly with international first spouses to promote safe technology, innovation, and child empowerment.Continuation/expansion of the Be Best initiative (from her first term, focused on child well-being, online safety, and cyberbullying prevention, referenced in discussions like her video call with Brigitte Macron).\n\nCritics were quick to pile on, saying everything about the film - the subject, her husband, the fact that he got elected again, accomplishments, anything to do with the inauguration last year is a blight on the progressive utopia they envisioned once Kamala Harris was sworn in. But the reality is Melania Trump is a strong woman, a great mother, and one of the most elegant First Ladies we've ever had. She just exudes class. Now let's compare that to the February 1st Vogue feature by Maya Singer on California Governor Gavin Newsom, whom Singer would greatly appreciate you falling in love with, as she has, and vote for him in the 2028 presidential election. I'm not going to tell you that the Singer piece is the single greatest piece of over-the-top propaganda ever put down in print, because I still remember when Barack Obama was elected. The messianic path media chose to chart covering the 44th president was truly stunning. Oprah Winfrey regarded Obama as 'The One'. A Chicago art gallery featured a piece with Obama under a halo. Andrew Sullivan in the Atlantic said, \"If Bill Clinton is the Old Testament, Barack Obama is the New Testament.\" The beatification of Obama became so intense in 2008 that Slate Magazine, of all place, featured a running column called Obama Messiah Watch to encapsulate the most egregious examples of journalists literally worshipping the former President. So this type of media tongue-bathing of political candidates, exclusively Democratic, by the way, is nothing new. To be fair to the Obama apostles in media, however, they did not have much of an actual track record on which to temper their worship. Obama was young, dynamic, Black, and hadn't done anything except show up to work occasionally in the United States Senate for the first two years of a six-year term. That's it. No record of accomplishments, no record of failures running things. All they had was his own soaring rhetoric, stuff like, 'with his election, the seas would quit rising.' All they had was, to use an expression, hot air, and they got carried away by it. In Gavin Newsom's case, there's exactly no justification for how far up his caboose Singer chose to travel in order to claim he's the next coming for the Democrats. Unlike Obama, Newsom has a record. A very long and sordid one. The very beginning of Singer's piece tells you all you need to know about how hard-hitting this attempt at journalism is. \n\nLet’s get this out of the way: He is embarrassingly handsome, his hair seasoned with silver, at ease with his own eminence as he delivers his final State of the State address. “In Washington, the president believes that might makes right,” pronounces California governor Gavin Newsom. “Secret police, businesses raided, windows smashed, citizens detained, citizens shot, masked men snatching people in broad daylight….” His tone is temperate, but the words echo through the State Capitol’s Assembly chamber, the august backdrop for his speech. “Lining the pockets of the rich; crony capitalism at an unimaginable scale,” he goes on. “Rolling back rights…. Rewriting history.” Newsom shakes his head, seeming more mournful than angry. Seeming, yes, presidential. “None of this is normal.”It must drive Trump nuts. Newsom: lithe, ardent, energetic, a glimmer of optimism in his eye; Kennedy-esque. Add to that his stunning wife and four adorable kids, and the executive strut of a self-made millionaire who has spent the past seven years at the helm of a state big, complex, and rich enough to be a nation of its own. Then there’s the stuff Newsom has been doing.\n\nHoo-boy. Much too wordy. She could have punctuated the first sentence after embarrasing. No need to make it an adverb to describe handsome. He's been a train-wreck and a national embarrassment for virtually his entire eight years at the helm in California. Even the way Singer describes the setting for his final, thank God, state of the state address in the Assembly side of the state capitol in Sacramento is absurd. Baseball stadiums these days are considered cathedrals. The teams may suck, but most of the places where Major League Baseball is played are stunning architectural designs and have a lot of cool, unique angles and features. If state capitol chambers are to be compared to the Majors, or the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., the California Assembly would compare to Sam Lynn Ballpark in Bakersfield, California, which used to play home to a Class-A club until they folded. That field was the only one in North America that had to delay afternoon starts, because home plate faced the setting sun and blinded hitters. It was a rotten, ugly place to play ball. But it's the line about Newsom being a self-made millionaire that has Californians who know better looking for the trash cans in which to hurl. Newsom loves to tell the part of his bio about how his mom and dad divorced, mom struggled, so he struggled. What always gets left out of the mix is that his father managed the J. Paul Getty trust, Getty being the oil tycoon and the richest man in the world at the time. Newsom Sr.'s bestie? Getty's son, Gordon. The Singer piece goes this far, that Gavin may have had access to wealth and some privelege, but that's as far as her Don Lemonesque journalistic integrity will take her. Her claim right at the outset was that Gavin is a self-made millionaire. That's not even remotely true. Newsom's first business venture, Plumpjack, had a ton of seed money invested in it. Want to take a guess who put in the ante for Gavin's forthcoming millions? His name rhymes with Petty. Gordon not only invested, but continued to pump in the money as Plumpjack evolved from wine shop to winery to restaurants and hotels in the Golden State. And it was the Getty family, a lot of them, actually, who helped fund his entry into politics, first as county supervisor, then mayor of San Francisco, lieutenant governor, before landing the top job in the state for two terms. Without the Getty's, and then subsequently, Reid Hoffman (yes, Jeffrey Epstein's apparent bestie from the latest release of icky stuff), and Alex Soros. It's not hard to become a millionaire when you mooch off of a handful of multi-billionaires. Later in the fawn-fest, Singer makes this declaration, with another F.O.G (friend of Gavin), providing the 'evidence.' \n\nNewsom has been vindicated by history. “He believes he’s coming from the right place, and he believes in his ability to get things done, so if he puts himself out there, it’s for the greater good,” says Gatti, thinking through his old friend’s way of choosing his battles.\n\nVidicated by history? Well, let's look at the last almost eight years of Newsom history in California, shall we? The budget Newsom inherited in 2018-19 was around $203 billion. It was running a surplus, with around $19 billion in a rainy day fund, and that had been growing in previous years. Today? The Golden State budget for this year and next is $349 billion, running billions in the red for this year, and according to economists at Stanford's Hoover Institution, has a state deficit - one-year spending, mind you, not accumulated debt, of $73 billion. Newsom is playing a shell game with the numbers, borrowing from estimated future revenues to offset and hide current actual shortfalls until after he leaves office. He's handing a debt bomb to whomever succeeds him, Republican or Democrat. As for actual long-term debt, both Stanford and Reason economists have independently concluded in their own analyses that California owes over a trillion dollars of unfunded pension liabilities. A trillion dollars. Slick hair and a Vogue puff piece isn't going to hide that from voters in a national presidential campaign. On homelessness, Gavin Newsom has made that a priority every year of his eight years in office. \n\nHomelessness will never be solved in California under Gavin Newsom.There are too many people making a ton of money from it. pic.twitter.com/Cdli5dlT23— Planet Of Memes (@PlanetOfMemes) February 1, 2026\n\nCalifornia's taxpayers have now spent, thanks to Gavin and the Democrats, $37 billion dollars to fix the homeless crisis Gavin rinsed and repeated every year. The scoreboard? At least 30-36,000 more homeless people are on the streets of the Golden State as a result. How was the money actually spent? Well, that answer gets nebulous when you ask that of Democrats in Sacramento and the Governor's office.

Remember the Scam Tram, the Little Train That Couldn't, the Train from nowhere to nowhere? When Newsom put his hand on something to take the oath of office, and the other hand immediately began reaching into the pockets of every California taxpayer, the boondoggle of all boondoggles had spent around $25 billion dollars to lay exactly zero miles of track between Bakersfield and Modesto. Zero. Not a half-mile, not a tenth of a mile, zero. We're eight years on under Gavin's hope and promise of the California bullet train literally no one will ride. Another $12 billion has been spent. On what? I have no idea. But I know on what it hasn't been spent - track. The project still has not laid so much as a foot of line to shorten the distance between, *checks notes*, two places that are both in the middle of nowhere. There are no plans in the near future to lay track. But there are, or were plans to keep spending that money until President Donald Trump killed the project a couple months ago via executive order. Without Trump's action, California's Scam Tram was estimated to cost $110 billion and be finished sometime after my kids become a worm feast. Compare that to Japan's Maglev train, which was just clocked at 310 miles-per-hour in testing for Phase 1. \n\nReporters are left speechless after getting a glimpse of Japan’s new (“bullet”) train, the Maglev going 310 mph. pic.twitter.com/rrzpTnTDoe— Juanita Broaddrick (@atensnut) February 3, 2026\n\nHow much will it cost Japan to build it? $75 billion. And the terminal point for the initial phase is Tokyo, which is a city that actually has a lot of people living in it, unlike Modesto. \n\nAnd lastly, the fires that consumed hundreds of homes in Altadena and Pacific Palisades burned just over a year ago. Has construction been robust and ongoing, being that Gavin promised there would be zero red tape? Of course, not. He never wanted new single family residences. He wants high-density, low-income housing. He wants the shoreline, some of the most pristine oceanview land in the world to be built, eventually, into Newsom tenanment housing. \n\nDonald Trump put a stop to that, too, and has now charged EPA administrator Lee Zeldin to bigfoot Newsom and the state and streamline the permitting and building. \n\n🚨 NEW: Trump’s new 'LA permitting czar' Lee Zeldin FIRES UP the rebuild after wildfires: “This needs to move at Trump speed!”No red tape.

But to those of us who know better, the ones who have fled California for redder state pastures and suckers like me who remain here for the weather and the economic masochism, Gavin is next cycle's Kamala Harris - no real upside, and huge political liabilities. Harris couldn't articulate her way out of a paper sack. Newsom lies his way out of uncomfortable spots through bravado, bluster, and body movements that make you think he contracted Tim Walz' jazz hands and the condition went systemic. Harris ran from the fact she had no experience on which to run.

The largest association of board-certified plastic surgeons in the world cited “insufficient evidence” that the benefits of such surgeries outweigh the risks. \n\nThis is the first major medical professional association that has come out in opposition to sex change, or gender transition surgeries for minors. \n\nMore specifically, the society reports that it has studied the issue of breast/chest, genital, and facial gender surgery in individuals under the age of 19. As a result, it has issued its position statement as guidance to its 11,000 members in North America and abroad. \n\nThe guidance points out that rapid change in treatment models for people experiencing gender dysphoria or “gender incongruence” required timely attention. For context, it lists the most common treatments provided to minors, which include counseling and therapy, “social transition,” puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones, and ultimately surgery. \n\nThe ASPS has determined that “systematic reviews and evidence reassessments have subsequently identified limitations in study quality, consistency, and follow-up alongside emerging evidence of treatment complications and potential harms.” \n\nWhile the society said that its position statement is not a clinical practice guideline for physicians, its board of directors decided the ASPS needed to make clear its stance to “provide professional guidance to ASPS members in a rapidly evolving and controversial clinical area.” \n\nIt would seem that because the development of formal clinical practice guidelines takes no small amount of time, the position statement route was the more expedient approach for the ASPS based on the red flags it already sees. Clinical practice guidelines include independent systematic evidence assessment, consensus panels, and/or strength-of-recommendation determinations. \n\nIf the interests of the child are the priority, it only makes sense to issue a position statement that errs on the side of caution as scientific and medical research plays catch-up. The actual position is as follows: \n\nASPS concludes there is insufficient evidence demonstrating a favorable risk-benefit ratio for the pathway of gender-related endocrine and surgical interventions in children and adolescents. ASPS recommends that surgeons delay gender-related breast/chest, genital, and facial surgery until a patient is at least 19 years old.\n\nAnticipating that it will be criticized for taking such a strong position without the usual amount of medical evidence, the society preemptively countered by saying in its statement, “ASPS acknowledges that many plastic surgical clinical recommendations and standards rely on lower levels of evidence compared to those of other medical specialties. However, ethical decision-making in medicine does not depend on evidence quality alone, but on the relationship between evidence uncertainty, anticipated benefit, potential harm, and patient vulnerability.” \n\nIn other words, when it comes to minors, who are very vulnerable and at risk of irreversible lifetime damage, it’s most ethical to consider the uncertainty of the evidence itself as compounding the risk. \n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., praised the ASPS for “protecting children from harmful sex-rejecting procedures.” HHS stated that the ASPS relied in part on its report, \"Treatment for Pediatric Gender Dysphoria: Review of Evidence and Best Practices.\"\n\nKennedy said, “We commend the American Society of Plastic Surgeons for standing up to the overmedicalization lobby and defending sound science. By taking this stand, they are helping protect future generations of American children from irreversible harm.” \n\nCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Administrator Mehmet Oz, MD, added, “When the medical ethics textbooks of the future are written, they’ll look back on sex-rejecting procedures for minors the way we look back on lobotomies. I applaud the American Society of Plastic Surgeons for placing itself on the right side of history by opposing these dangerous, unscientific experiments.” \n\nThe ASPS position statement reveals something the left has been working very hard to bury, and it's something most people already suspect. The society took into account what happens during the “natural course of gender dysphoria” when minors do not receive medical treatment. It concluded that, among children, the vast majority of those who experience gender dysphoria resolve it without any medical intervention. Among adolescents, the ASPS said that existing evidence suggests that the majority will find resolution without medical intervention as well. This is consistent with the HHS report. \n\nFounded in 1931, the ASPS counts as members physicians who have been certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery or the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada. \n\nWhile this development is about medical professionals taking a stand for what is right, it should not be lost on anyone that if Kamala Harris were president right now, the ASPS might not have come to this position. President Donald Trump and his administration are making it easy once again for medical associations and doctors to do what is right.\n\nFind out what you’re missing behind the members-only wall.

Newsweek reached out to the White House and Bad Bunny’s representatives at Rimas Publishing for comment. Why It Matters The NFL picked Bad Bunny, the Puerto Rican-born musician whose real name is Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, to headline the halftime show this year. The decision drew mixed reactions. He is one of the most popular musicians in the world, and his fans celebrated the pick as a highlight of cultural representation during the widely viewed halftime show. Critics, however, have opposed Bad Bunny’s performance due to his more political lyrics about immigration and colonialism. What to Know Trump is among the conservatives who oppose Bad Bunny performing at the Super Bowl. He criticized the decision in remarks to The New York Post last month. “I’m anti-them. I think it’s a terrible choice. All it does is sow hatred. Terrible,” the president told the publication. His performance has become a flashpoint for cultural debate over recent weeks—particularly after Bad Bunny criticized U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations during a speech at the Grammys on Sunday. A new poll from YouGov showed Americans were mostly split in their views of Bad Bunny, though a narrow plurality said they view him positively. Bad Bunny attends the 2025 Met Gala in New York City on May 5, 2025. In total, 35 percent of respondents viewed him favorably, compared to 32 percent who viewed him unfavorably, according to the poll, which surveyed 1,672 adults from January 30 to February 2, 2026. Thirty-three percent said they don’t know how they feel about him. Meanwhile, 28 percent said they were either somewhat or very satisfied with the decision to have him perform at the Super Bowl; 27 percent said they were either somewhat or very dissatisfied with the decision. That same poll found that most Americans are not happy with Trump’s performance in office. Fifty-four percent of respondents said they disapprove of his job performance, while 40 percent gave him positive marks. A Harvard CAPS/Harris poll found that 50 percent of Americans view Trump unfavorably, while 42 percent view him favorably. It surveyed 2,000 registered voters from January 28-29, 2026, and had a margin of error of plus or minus 1.99 percentage points. A TIPP poll showed Trump at 41 percent favorability and 50 percent unfavourability. It surveyed 1,384 adults from January 27-29, 2026. Bad Bunny Super Bowl Performance Sparks Conservative Fury The NFL’s decision to bring on Bad Bunny as the Super Bowl performer has been met with outrage from conservatives over his criticism of Trump and lyrics being primarily in Spanish. In response to the halftime show, conservative group Turning Point USA organized a competing “All-American Halftime Show” headlined by Kid Rock, and a Change.org petition to replace Bad Bunny with country singer George Strait garnered over 100,000 signatures. Bad Bunny has been outspoken about politics and endorsed former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. He has also frequently criticized Trump, dating back to 2017, following the Trump administration’s widely scrutinized response to Hurricane Maria. He also opted against touring in the U.S. amid concerns about ICE. “There was the issue of, like, f****** ICE could be outside [my concert],“ he told i-D magazine. “And it’s something that we were talking about and very concerned about.“ Bad Bunny Called Out ICE at Grammy Awards Just a week earlier, Bad Bunny condemned ICE during an acceptance speech at the Grammy Awards. “Before I say thanks to God, I’m gonna say: ICE out!” he said to an extensive applause from the audience. “We are not savage. We are not animals. We are not aliens, we are humans and we are Americans.” He warned that “hate gets more powerful with hate.” “The only thing that is more powerful than hate is love. So, please, we need to be different,” he said. What People Are Saying Roger Goodell, NFL Commissioner, speaking to the press about Bad Bunny’s halftime performance after the Grammys: “This platform is used to unite people, and to be able to bring people together with their creativity, with their talents, and to be able to use this moment to do that. And I think artists in the past have done that. I think Bad Bunny understands that, and I think he’ll have a great performance.” Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem told Fox News Digital in response to Bad Bunny and other celebrities’ ICE critiques: “I wish they knew what wonderful, amazing people our ICE officers are. Many of these officers live in these communities where they are doing enforcement activities.” President Donald Trump downplayed Bad Bunny’s cultural impact in an interview on Newsmax on October 6: “I never heard of him. I don't know who he is, I don't know why they're doing it, it's like crazy...I think it's absolutely ridiculous.“ What Happens Next The Super Bowl will take place on February 8, 2026.","summary":"Trump has spoken out against Bad Bunny as this year&#039;s Super Bowl halftime performer amid conservative outrage.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/bad-bunny-and-donald-trumps-popularity-compared-ahead-of-super-bowl-11460869","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2213605944.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-03 20:56:22","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.29},{"id":399072950,"title":"My night with Kamala: Harris’s ‘I told you so’ tour comes to Richmond","text":"Turns out, they would. She pulled in almost a full house. \n\nThe Richmond leg was a stop on the second part of Harris’s book tour, after her team added 18 more dates following a successful first 17. Other areas included the critical primary state of South Carolina, as well as cities with large black voter populations, such as Detroit; Jackson, Mississippi; Memphis, Tennessee; and Montgomery, Alabama.\n\nHer strategic stops made sense. Harris is considering jumping into the 2028 White House race. A new Harvard-Harris poll released this week shows her leading the Democratic contenders, while Vice President JD Vance has a commanding lead among Republicans. Harris, who lost the 2024 election to President Donald Trump under unique circumstances, won Virginia with 52% of the vote. In Richmond, 82% of voters cast their ballot for her.\n\nInside the Altria Theater, there was another political celebrity audience members were buzzing about, but the line to take pictures with her, unlike Harris, was free.\n\nGov. Abigail Spanberger (D-VA), the state’s first female governor, attended the event with her husband and three daughters. She was seated in the third row of the box seats and posed for pictures with fans so close that her security looked nervous at times.\n\nTwenty-two minutes after it was scheduled to start, the main event, a sort of “I told you this would happen” rant, began.\n\nHarris, dressed in a black pant suit, came out to a standing ovation. The moderator was Emily Calandrelli, known as “The Space Gal” on Netflix and the 100th woman to fly in space. Almost immediately, two pro-Palestinian protesters started shouting from their seats and were quickly escorted out. The former vice president, unfazed, kept talking.\n\nDuring the hourlong conversation, Harris fielded questions from Calandrelli on what civic engagement could accomplish, America’s standing in the world, new alliances, science, and took verbal jabs at Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\nHarris also discussed the unrest in Minneapolis, charging that the Trump administration was trying to persuade people to doubt what they were seeing with their own eyes. She also strongly questioned the tactics being used by federal officers after two U.S. citizens, Renee Good and Alex Pretti, were shot to death in January.\n\n“In reality, we all saw what happened,” Harris said. “A federal law enforcement agency that has been sicced on communities like a paramilitary force to wreak violence in American cities.”\n\nHarris said immigration reform is needed in the United States but criticized the administration’s approach.\n\n“When we see the brutality of it, when we see the abuse of power, to be told, ‘Turn your eyes away. You didn’t see what you think you saw,'” she said. “To be told by people who are in a position of authority and power, before there’s even been an investigation, what conclusion they have drawn within seemingly minutes, and therefore that’s the conclusion the American people should draw. That’s not how democracy works.”\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the Pretti shooting, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem described him as a “domestic terrorist,” while White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller called him an “assassin” who “tried to murder federal agents.”\n\nHarris reserved her sharpest attacks for Trump, telling the audience she predicted everything he and his administration would do and that people should have listened to her. She also took aim at corporate leaders, universities, and members of Congress — accusing them of “capitulation,” having a “feckless nature,” and bowing to a “tyrant.”\n\n“How are they going to stand up for what is right in our democracy and then just bend at the knee at the foot of the tyrant?” she said to applause. She added that people in Congress know there is an “abuse of power” but are too afraid to speak out publicly. \n\n“If they speak out, then [Trump] will say something. … These elected people who know what is wrong but don’t want to say anything in public for fear they will be called out, and then they’re worried about the security of themselves and their family,” she said. “That’s what’s happening in our country right now.”\n\nHarris said the only remaining guardrails, for now, are judges.\n\n“We do thankfully have a number of judges who are in position and who have rightly been standing up and showing in case after case what [Trump] is doing is unconstitutional and a violation of the law,” she said.\n\nHarris’s talk turned to the midterm elections, and she encouraged everyone to vote, framing it as one of the most important elections to save democracy.\n\n“We have the midterms coming up and an opportunity to put the guardrails in place around checks and balances based on those three coequal branches of government and put [Trump] in a place where he needs to be checked based on his abuses,” she said. “We have power.”\n\nFollowing her hourlong conversation, in which she did not address future plans nor her possible Democratic rivals, the Washington Examiner was eager to find out what the audience thought.\n\nAn 82-year-old woman who lives in the Church Hill area of Richmond, named Martha, said it was the first time she’d felt “hopeful” in a while and pledged to volunteer with local campaigns.\n\nWHEN VICE PRESIDENTS ARE FROZEN IN MARBLE\n\nHer 79-year-old neighbor and companion, Melvin Harrison, did not have the same experience.\n\n“I came because the ticket was free,” Harrison said. “I could have stayed at home and watched Memphis play and had a better time.

The “Arrested Development” star said, “No, none?” Hayes, who is child-free himself, also asked, “Wait? Why?” before he conceded, “It’s not really any of my business.”\n\nInstead of dropping the subject, Bateman, the father of two daughters, 19 and 13, pressed the “360” singer on her choice, explaining that his wife did not want to have children when they met, yet later changed her mind.\n\nAcknowledging the possibility, Charli said, “I love the fantasy of having a child, like naming it sounds so fun, but like that is exactly a sign to me as to why I should not have one, the fact that that feels like the coolest part about it and like, maybe I’m not ready, you know?”\n\nAgain, Bateman would not let the subject go. He told the singer, “All that could change,” especially if she found the right partner. “So you might find somebody,” Bateman said.\n\nIn response, Charli calmly said, “Well, I’m married, so.”\n\nIndeed, Charli is married to George Daniel, who is the drummer of the band The 1975. They hosted two lavish weddings last year: One in London, and another in Sicily, Italy.\n\nBateman tried to laugh off his mistake by saying, “I got to read a newspaper one of these days.” To that, Charli joked: “No. It’s OK. I knew immediately where you were gonna go, I knew my response, I was really looking forward to it.”\n\nListeners jumped online to blast Bateman for being rude and feeling it was OK to grill a woman on her family planning choices. “People with kids are so weird about people who don’t want to have kids,” one person said on the Fauxmois Subreddit. \n\n“Why the (expletive) does society continue to pressure women, in particular, about having kids?!?” another person said. “Yep. I really hate when men act so incredulous at the thought of women not wanting kids,” said a third person.\n\n“Jason Bateman being gross about women? What a shocker,” said yet another.\n\nA number of people also were astounded that Bateman knew so little about the singer, including the fact that she was married or that her sixth album, “Brat,” became a cultural phenomenon in 2024 with “Brat Summer.” The so-called brat lifestyle also became a national political talking point, as branding for Kamala Harris’ effort to court the youth vote during her presidential campaign.\n\n“Do these hosts not research … the people who are coming to their podcasts???” one person said. “The name of this podcast is so apt.”\n\nHayes clearly knew about Charli’s success, with the “Will and Grace” star gushing about some of the hit songs from “Brat.” At one point, he turned to Bateman and asked, “Do you remember, Kamala is brat?”\n\nBateman sounded clueless and admitted, “That started with you? I’m so old.”\n\nOn Reddit, one person said. “This is one of my problems with the ‘Smartless’ podcast. They do some great interviews and then they do some where it’s clear they really don’t know the person and barely did research.” But this person and others also acknowledged the premise of the podcast, which is that one of the hosts brings on a mystery guest for the three to interview. That means the other hosts would not have the opportunity to do any homework.\n\n“So if (Charli is) Sean Hayes’ guest, Jason and Will don’t know about it until the podcast starts,” another commenter said. “They’ve done it that way since the beginning. But it can lead to very awkward moments like this lol.”","summary":"Bateman assured the pop star she would change her mind about having children if she found the right partner -- she's already married.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2026/02/03/jason-bateman-grilling-charli-xcx/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/CharliXCX.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-03 20:09:28","author":"Martha Ross","authors":["Martha Ross"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.034},{"id":399072396,"title":"Disney parks chief Josh D'Amaro replaces Bob Iger as CEO","text":"Disney has named its parks chief Josh D'Amaro to succeed Bob Iger as the entertainment giant's top executive.\n\nD'Amaro will become the ninth CEO in the more than 100-year-old company's history. He has overseen the company's theme parks, cruises and resorts since 2020. The so-called experiences division has been a substantial money maker for Disney, with $36 billion US in annual revenue in fiscal 2025 and 185,000 employees worldwide.\n\nThe 54-year-old takes over a time when Disney is flush with box office hits like Zootopia 2 and Avatar: Fire and Ash and its streaming business is strong. But Disney and other legacy studios are stumbling through a precarious time for Hollywood. The rise of generative AI, consolidation of streaming and producing giants, and the perceived interference from the U.S. government in the workings of entertainment companies has mired the industry in confusion. \n\nThe decision on the next chief executive at Disney comes almost four years after the company's choice to replace Iger went disastrously, forcing him back into the job.\n\nOnly two years after stepping down as CEO, Iger returned in 2022 after a period of clashes, missteps and a weakening financial performance under his hand-picked successor, Bob Chapek.\n\nThis time, Disney sought out its next CEO meticulously. The company created a succession planning committee in 2023, but the search began in earnest in 2024 when it enlisted Gorman, who previously served as Morgan Stanley's executive chair, to lead the effort. That still gave it ample opportunity to vet candidates, as Iger agreed to a contract extension.\n\nDisney said that Iger will continue to serve as a senior advisor and board member until his retirement from the company at the end of the year.\n\nMergers, meddling and money\n\nThe change also comes amid a period of turmoil and scrutiny for the company. Iger, who once considered running for U.S. president against Donald Trump, saw his company highlighted in headlines late last year. As the parent company of ABC, Disney was widely criticized for deciding to pull Jimmy Kimmel Live! after host Kimmel claimed on-air that the accused shooter of conservative pundit Charlie Kirk — who was killed in September 2025 — was a member of the \"MAGA gang.\"\n\nKimmel's comments drew the ire of U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) head Brendan Carr, as well as station owners Nexstar and Sinclair Broadcast Group. The two companies — which collectively control roughly one-quarter of ABC affiliates in the United States — decided to stop airing the show on their channels, before Disney summarily pulled it from the airwaves. \n\nThe impasse raised serious questions about whether the Trump administration had positioned itself to influence entertainment companies. Kimmel's on-air comments, which were directed toward \"the MAGA gang,\" were widely seen as critical of Republicans. \n\nThen and now, Nexstar was in the process of acquiring media company Tegna. That merger would grant it an outsized control over American airwaves, thus requiring FCC approval. Sinclair has since urged the regulator to approve that deal, claiming the future of the local broadcasting industry depends on it. \n\nEarlier, Paramount came under fire for its decision to pay $16 million US in a settlement with Trump over an interview with his Democratic rival Kamala Harris on the show 60 Minutes. Critics lambasted the settlement as a veiled attempt to ensure the company's $8-billion US merger with Skydance was approved.\n\nMeanwhile, its perceived closeness with the White House has raised alarm bells over editorial independence, should it be successful in its hostile takeover bid of Warner Bros. \n\nDisney's ABC News similarly settled a defamation lawsuit with Trump in late 2024, donating a reported $15 million US to his presidential library. And during the Kimmel fallout, Disney also needed government approval for its own acquisitions, such as its subsidiary ESPN's recently closed mega-deal with the NFL. \n\nThe decision to pull Kimmel's show came after Carr stated on a podcast that the FCC \"can do this the easy way or the hard way,\" in terms of how the commission would deal with the situation. Trump suggested that TV networks that cover him negatively could have their licenses revoked, while also posting online that the move to take Jimmy Kimmel Live! off the air was \"great news for America.\"\n\nEx-Disney CEO Michael Eisner called those threats \"aggressive yet hollow.\" Still, the fallout — aimed largely at Disney's perceived truckling to Trump — was swift. Kimmel's fellow talk show hosts, as well as other industry figures, lambasted the move, at times on their own shows. \n\nComedian John Oliver addressed a monologue directly to Iger on his own show, saying that the \"cowards\" who bent to Trump's will would be remembered negatively by history. Musician Sarah McLachlan subsequently cancelled a performance at the premiere for her Disney+-hosted documentary Lilith Fair: Building a Mystery \"in support of free speech.\" When Kimmel was brought back on the air, she performed on its opening episode. \n\nAnd — alongside protests and numerous calls for a boycott against Disney from the public — a group of shareholders later sent a letter demanding materials related to Iger's decision to suspend Kimmel's show. \n\nIn that letter, they claimed the company's stock had plummeted \"amid fears of brand damage and concerns that Disney was complicit in succumbing to the government overreach and media censorship.\" \n\nExternal, internal candidates\n\nWhile external candidates for Iger's replacement were considered, it was widely expected that Disney would look internally for the next CEO. The advantage would be that Iger had already been mentoring Disney executives, and that they would have had extensive contact with the company's 15 board members, which includes Iger himself. \n\nDisney is unique in that its top executive must oversee a sprawling entertainment company with branches reaching in every direction, while also serving as an unusually public figure.\n\nD'Amaro and Disney Entertainmentco-chair Dana Walden quickly emerged as the front runners for the top job.\n\nD'Amaro, who has been with Disney since 1998, has been leading the charge on Disney's multiyear $60-billion US investment into its cruise ships, resorts and theme parks. He also oversees Walt Disney Imagineering, which handles the design and development of the company's theme parks, resorts, cruise ships, and immersive experiences worldwide. D'Amaro has been leading Disney's licensing business, which includes its partnership with Epic Games.\n\nMeanwhile, Walden, i her most recent role as co-chair of Disney Entertainment, has helped oversee Disney's streaming business, along with its entertainment media, news and content divisions. She joined Disney in 2019. Before that, she spent 25 years at 21st Century Fox and was CEO of Fox Television Group.\n\nWalden will now step into the newly created role of chief creative officer of the Walt Disney Co. She will report to D'Amaro.\n\nThere had been speculation that Disney might go the route of naming co-CEOs, a move that has started to become more popular with companies including Oracle and Spotify.\n\nD'Amaro and Walden's appointments are effective March 18.","summary":"Disney has named its parks chief Josh D'Amaro to succeed Bob Iger as the entertainment giant's top executive.

The tensions came to a head when Anthropic cofounder Jack Clark penned an essay criticizing some in the tech world for dismissing concerns that AI could threaten humanity’s existence. \n\n“What we are dealing with is a real and mysterious creature, not a simple and predictable machine,” Clark wrote of AI. “And like all the best fairytales, the creature is of our own creation. Only by acknowledging it as being real and by mastering our own fears do we even have a chance to understand it, make peace with it, and figure out a way to tame it and live together.” \n\nVenture capitalist David Sacks, the White House’s special adviser for AI and crypto, hit back shortly after Clark published his essay, accusing Anthropic of hijacking concerns about AI development to construct a regulatory environment favorable to its bottom line. \n\n“Anthropic is running a sophisticated regulatory capture strategy based on fear-mongering,” he wrote. “It is principally responsible for the state regulatory frenzy that is damaging the startup ecosystem.”\n\nThe trading of blows between Sacks and Clark fits into a broader policy conflict over the regulation of AI. On one side of the issue are voices such as Sacks, who view the advancement of AI as a powerful engine for economic growth and fear that the United States could be left behind by global competitors if it over-regulates the industry. Those in Clark’s camp, meanwhile, maintain that while AI is incredibly promising, unchecked development could wreak havoc on human civilization through economic upheaval or even extinction.\n\nWhile the Trump administration has generally been friendly toward the former perspective, the latter won a major victory in July 2025 when the Senate advanced a version of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act without a provision that would have effectively barred state-level AI regulation. Subsequent efforts to ban state-level regulation have also fallen short.\n\nFirms such as OpenAI and Google had pushed for the provision, arguing that a hodgepodge of state laws could create an uncertain legal environment, thus stifling innovation. Anthropic, meanwhile, opposed the moratorium on regulation, citing what it believed was a pressing need for regulation to argue that the U.S. cannot afford to wait for Congress to act.\n\nAnthropic’s legislative victories are likely due in part to its high-powered and expensive bipartisan team of lobbyists.\n\nRachel Appleton, Anthropic’s first in-house lobbyist, previously served as an attorney in the Biden administration’s Department of Justice, Democratic counsel on the Senate Judiciary Committee, legislative counsel for Rep. Derek Kilmer (D-WA), and as a fellow on former Vice President Kamala Harris’s 2016 Senate campaign. Mary Croghan, another in-house lobbyist for the firm, was a senior GOP staffer on the judiciary committee and held various positions in other House offices and the White House before joining Anthropic. \n\nIn-house influencers aside, Anthropic has also spent considerable funds to retain both Republican and Democratic-aligned firms to lobby on its behalf.\n\nAcquia Group and Continental Strategy, which Anthropic has collectively paid nearly $1 million since 2023, were founded by Republican lobbyists. Tower 19, which Anthropic has paid roughly a quarter of a million dollars so far, and Avenue Solutions, which just registered to represent the AI giant, meanwhile, are aligned with Democrats.\n\nAvenue Solutions cites its “well-established relationships with Democratic Members and their staff on Capitol Hill” that it has accrued “over three decades” as evidence of its effectiveness in swaying members of Congress in ways beneficial to its clients.\n\nSacks has accused Anthropic of adopting a media strategy that portrays itself as a “target” of the Trump administration — a move likely to improve its reputation among those in the tech world — despite working with the administration. The venture-capitalist-turned-White-House-adviser also accused the firm of retaining liberal staffers to “lobby for the old Biden AI agenda.”\n\nThe Pentagon awarded Anthropic a transaction agreement with a $200 million ceiling in July 2025. The firm went further, offering access to two of its flagship products, Claude for Enterprise and Claude for Government, to all three branches of government for just $1 in August of last year. \n\nAfter the spat with Sacks, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei published a blog post highlighting the company’s cooperation with the Trump administration. \n\nAnthropic’s lobbying ramp-up has been ongoing for some time. \n\nSince launching its lobbying operation in 2023, Anthropic has spent just over $5.1 million on lobbyists, of which $210,000 was disbursed in its initial year. Anthropic increased its lobbying spending every quarter since the end of 2023, with the exception of the fourth quarter of 2025, when it reduced its spending from $1.18 million to $1.1 million. \n\nWhile OpenAI and others in the industry have seen similar upticks in lobbyist spending, the scale of Anthropic’s expansion has been comparatively significant. \n\nAnthropic did not respond to a request for comment.","summary":"As Antropic’s relationship with the White House oscillated between warm and cold in 2025, the artificial intelligence giant’s spending on lobbyists skyrocketed.

Blakeman told Newsweek the poll confirms that “a majority of New Yorkers want a new governor.” Meanwhile, Hochul campaign spokesperson Ryan Radulovacki told Newsweek that New Yorkers “want a steady hand and real results for their communities, and they know Governor Hochul has delivered.” Why It Matters Although New York is a historically Democratic state, it has become increasingly competitive over the past few years, with Hochul facing a closer-than-expected election in 2022. Republicans are hopeful that they can further narrow that gap and potentially flip the governorship from her in November. Early polling offers insights into how New York voters feel about candidates, including Hochul and Blakeman, the leading Republican who has earned the endorsement of President Donald Trump. The state has drifted away from Democrats as the party lost ground with key voter groups such as Latino, Asian American and young voters. This race will be a key test of whether Republicans can continue making inroads with those voters, or whether Democrats win them back and solidify their grasp on the state government. What To Know Hochul won support from a majority of New York voters in the latest Siena College poll, which surveyed 802 registered voters from January 26-28, 2026, with a margin of error of plus or minus 4.3 percentage points. Fifty-four percent of respondents said they would vote to re-elect Hochul in November, while 28 percent said they planned to cast their ballot for Blakeman. An additional 17 percent said they were still undecided about whom they would support. New York Governor Kathy Hochul at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago on August 19, 2024. It also found that only 42 percent of New Yorkers prefer to re-elect Hochul, while 51 percent prefer someone else to lead the state. In the Democratic primary, 11 percent would back Lieutenant Governor Antonio Delgado, while 64 percent said they would continue supporting Hochul. Hochul was viewed favorably by 49 percent of respondents and unfavorably by 40 percent. She is more well-known than Blakeman, viewed favorably by 18 percent and unfavorably by 20 percent of respondents. Donald Trump Looms Over New York Race Shawn Donahue, a professor of political science at the University at Buffalo, told Newsweek the race does not appear to be particularly competitive. Blakeman’s support for Trump may not help him in a state where the president’s approval rating remains low, he said. “It seems like it’s just going to be very hard to overcome in an overwhelming Democratic state with a very unpopular incumbent president whose policies are unpopular in the state, he’s personally unpopular, with a candidate that is pretty closely tied to him to be able to overcome that,” he said. Trump was viewed favorably by only 33 percent of respondents, while 63 percent viewed him unfavorably in the Siena poll. On the other hand, Blakeman’s pro-abortion-rights stance and history of winning elections in competitive Nassau County could be assets, Donahue said. Trump endorsed Blakeman after Representative Elise Stefanik dropped out of the race in December. “Bruce is MAGA all the way, and has been with me from the very beginning. As Nassau County Executive, he is working tirelessly with the Brave Heroes of ICE, Border Patrol, and Law Enforcement to Keep Our Border SECURE, Stop Migrant Crime, Safeguard our Community, and Ensure LAW AND ORDER. As your next Governor, Bruce will continue to fight hard to Grow the Economy, Cut Taxes, and Regulations, Promote MADE IN THE U.S.A., Champion American Energy DOMINANCE, Strengthen our Military/Veterans, Advance Election Integrity, and Protect our always under siege Second Amendment!“ he wrote on Truth Social in December. Hochul's Closer-Than-Expected 2022 Victory Hochul ascended to the governorship after former Governor Andrew Cuomo resigned in 2021 over a report from Attorney General Letitia James' office alleging that he sexually harassed multiple female employees and created a toxic work environment. She won a full term in 2022 with just 53.1 percent of the vote, the narrowest margin in a New York gubernatorial race since 1994. Hochul appears to have “grown into the position” since 2022, Donahue said. In her first gubernatorial campaign, she was less well known to voters across the state, while Republicans had a more successful message on crime that year, he said. New York has not elected a Republican governor since George Pataki’s reelection in 2002. But there have been signs that Democrats’ grip on the state has slipped. Former Vice President Kamala Harris received less than 56 percent of the vote in New York last year, the weakest performance for a Democrat in decades. Democrats will be working to win back voters who drifted toward Republicans and Trump in this year's elections. Zohran Mamdani Remains Question Mark on Gubernatorial Race New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani, who took office in January, remains an open question in the gubernatorial race, Donahue said. “Progressives think he is going to deliver all of these great things. Republicans and conservatives think he will bring it back to 1970s when you were watching the Death Wish series. Will it be one of those two things? Is the city going to be really on the rise or really on decline? Or will it be somewhere in between? How much will he be an asset or a liability?” he said. The Siena poll found that a plurality of respondents view Mamdani positively; 48 percent said they have a favorable view of the mayor, compared to 32 percent who view him unfavorably. Hochul backed Mamdani in the mayoral race; Mamdani, however, has not made an endorsement in the governor’s race. Blakeman previously raised concerns about Mamdani's tenure in an interview with Newsweek. “'I'm deeply concerned that he signed an executive order that basically took the definition of antisemitism that was approved by the Holocaust Memorial Council. And he completely rejected that after [former Mayor] Eric Adams instituted that. I was very curious as to why did you do that the first week you're in office?“ he said. What People Are Saying Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman told Newsweek: “This poll confirms that a majority of New Yorkers want a new governor because Kathy Hochul’s policies have caused taxes, electricity bills, and insurance premiums to soar, and New York to become unaffordable,” he said. Hochul campaign spokesperson Ryan Radulovacki told Newsweek: “New Yorkers know Governor Kathy Hochul always goes to bat for them – whether that’s continuing to bring costs down and make our state safer, or standing up to Donald Trump’s relentless attacks on New York families. In a time of unprecedented chaos out of D.C., New Yorkers want a steady hand and real results for their communities, and they know Governor Hochul has delivered.” Siena pollster Steven Greenberg wrote in the polling release: “As we start the second month of this much watched mid-term election year, Hochul has a commanding lead among registered voters over both Delgado, among Democrats, and Blakeman, with all voters. While a 49-40% favorability rating is not generally seen as something to gloat about, for Hochul it is a net seven point gain from December, but more noteworthy is the fact that it is the first time in four and a half years as governor that Hochul has had 49% of voters view her favorably in a Siena poll.” What Happens Next Forecasters give Hochul an advantage. The Cook Political Report classifies the race as being Safe Democratic, while Sabato’s Crystal Ball views it as Likely Democratic. Kalshi betting odds give Democrats a 91 percent chance of victory in November.","summary":"Hochul faces a challenge from Trump-backed Bruce Blakeman in New York&#039;s gubernatorial race.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/kathy-hochul-chances-defeated-bruce-blakeman-poll-11459862","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2167486793.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-03 19:30:15","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.129},{"id":399056160,"title":"The SAVE Act Is Popular, and Democrats Are Terrified of It","text":"In a sane world, the rules for voting would be simple and with very few exceptions: one verified citizen, one vote, on one day.

That’s why 36 states and most of the world’s developed countries already have it on the books.To most Americans, the only thing suspicious about voter ID is why anyone would oppose it. Surely no one wants noncitizens voting, right? Right?Actually, Democrat leaders, donors, and activists very much want noncitizens voting. Elected Democrats are perfectly aware that the party machine registers ineligible voters and harvests their ballots as a matter of course. They also know that their woke base believes voter ID laws are pure evil, part of Donald Trump’s neo-fascist conspirazzzzzzzzzzz…Conventional political wisdom, therefore, dismisses voter ID as a legislative nonstarter. Sure, Republicans could pass a bill like the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act through the House of Representatives, as they did last April. But Senate Democrats would filibuster it, denying the GOP the 60 votes they’d need to end debate and pass the bill.\n\nI don't KNOW the backroom reasons, but whatever they are, they are bad ones. \n\nBREAKING:.@RepLuna (R-FL) said that she was given assurance the Senate will move forward with a standing filibuster to pass the SAVE America Act.The SAVE America Act = proof of citizenship + photo voter ID.Don’t stop until it’s done. pic.twitter.com/nnbgEHwlQt— ThePersistence (@ScottPresler) February 3, 2026\n\nRachel Bovard at The Federalist has a modest proposal. Allow the Democrats to filibuster, but only in the old \"Mr Smith Goes to Washington\" way. Instead of the lazy way that happens now, where votes to invoke cloture fail, just make the Democrats actually get up and make the arguments until their throats are too dry to speak. You know, Corey Booker style. \n\nFor Senate Republicans, the strategy is all upside.Today, they are staring down the barrel of a midterm election rout and two years of investigations and impeachments. On their current course, Democrats’ illegal voter registration programs will continue apace, and their violent, insurrectionist activists will declare victory in 2026 and start working on 2028. Senate Republicans could reverse all those trends in a matter of days just by putting the House-passed voter ID bill on the Senate floor.A Real FilibusterPoliticos who have only been Congress-watching this century have a funhouse-mirrors notion of the U.S. Senate’s legislative procedure.In the post-Harry Reid Senate, majorities only bring bills to the floor once negotiators have secured 60 votes behind closed doors. Bills are called up Monday evening, and a cloture motion (to end debate) is immediately filed, starting a countdown clock that leads to a vote by Thursday.This is not how the Senate is supposed to function. The old Senate process — with open-ended debate — is still the rules default setting. If Senate Republicans considered the SAVE Act under the traditional process, it would spring a trap from which Democrats might never recover.\n\nSenators like to tell you that the Senate is the world's most august deliberative body, but no actual deliberation takes place there anymore. They don't even engage in the pretense anymore. There is some blather on the floor, but no real debate, no genuine explanations or arguments. It is purely performative, and the performances are generally bad, halfhearted, and the actors aren't even attractive. \n\nHow about making them debate? It doesn't violate the rules. In fact, this is what the rules were meant to require. \n\n— Mike Lee (@BasedMikeLee) February 3, 2026\n\nHere’s how it would work. Leader Thune would call up the House-passed voter ID bill. At this point, the Senate would be “on” the SAVE Act. Senate rules would dictate that a vote on the bill — at a 51-vote simple majority threshold — must be the next thing the Senate does. The only way to delay that vote is for a senator to stand up and speak — indefinitely. It’s harder to sustain than it sounds. To give an hours-long speech, a senator may not leave the floor, not even to use the restroom. He may not sit. He may not eat. If he so much as leans on his desk, he loses the floor, which either triggers the vote or requires another senator to begin speaking. Democrat colleagues could piggyback on the filibuster and give long speeches of their own — but only two per senator. Once every filibustering senator’s speeches have been exhausted, the SAVE Act vote happens automatically. Cloture — the 60 votes required to end debate the easy way — isn’t needed. Sheer physical exertion will carry the day.\n\nOf course, making this happen requires a bit of actual work on the part of Republicans. Or not exactly work. It requires the ability to sit through boring speeches until the Democrats give up. Not everybody is Corey Booker, after all. And no doubt some of the Democratic Senators lack passion on this issue anyway, or at least enough to get up off their asses and give a long speech without a bathroom break. \n\nWhy are Democrats against the SAVE Act?Because Kamala Harris only won states that don’t require voter ID.It’s clear Democrats oppose voter ID because they want to cheat in our elections. pic.twitter.com/Hged3p4l9T— Christian Collins (@CollinsforTX) February 3, 2026\n\nI won't argue, exactly, that the squishier Republicans like the way things have been for decades, and are perhaps not as outraged by the status quo ante, but it's pretty clear that a lot of them are quite comfortable enjoying the perks and privileges they enjoy as the Republic declines. \n\n🚨🇺🇸 VIRGINIA DEMS' FIRST MOVE WITH NEW MAJORITY: BAN HAND-COUNTING BALLOTSForty-eight hours.

And it is DIFFICULT to fight against it, so why try?\n\nBut as the polling shows, passing the SAVE Act will hurt nobody politically. It only requires a willingness to make the Democrats put their money where their mouth is. Nobody will lose a set because they voted for this bill, even if the Democrats call them racist. That card has been played so much that nobody takes it seriously anyway. \n\nIt can be done.

Janet Mills (D) entered the Senate race last October, there was talk as to whether she could blunt the momentum of political newcomer Graham Platner, who was endorsed early on by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) amid demands from hardline Democrats for a \"fighter\" who could take on President Trump and Congressional Republicans.\n\nAt the time, and in light of what happened with former President Joe Biden, some Democrats and affiliated left-wing special interest groups immediately raised concerns about Mills' age after her announcement. She was 77 when she declared her candidacy, and turned 78 in December. She would be 79 ahead of her swearing-in, should she become the nominee and defeat Maine Sen. Susan Collins (R).\n\n\"We all talk about the importance of attracting new voters and regaining the trust of certain groups that may have fallen away from the Democratic Party, and I think when you do the same old, same old, that is the last thing you are doing,\" ex-Pennsylvania congresswoman Susan Wild (D), who is 68, said at the time.\n\nREAD MORE: Dems in Disarray Already Underway in Maine As Janet Mills Enters Senate Race\n\nHere we are a few months later, and the polling on the Maine Democrat Senate primary has been all over the map. Some show Platner with double-digit leads despite issues like the Nazi tattoo scandal and despite his backstory falling apart, while others show Mills comfortably ahead.\n\nBut though the questions about Mills' age and health seemed to quiet down a bit after her initial campaign launch, where she vowed to only serve one term, they roared back to life during a recent CNN interview the governor did, where the Democrats' disdain for having a repeat of the Joe Biden debacle came up.\n\nHere's how Mills responded:\n\n\"Do you think that the memory in your party about Joe Biden, is that going to be too much for you too?\" [CNN's Manu] Raju asked.\"Good Lord! Oh, I'm not Joe Biden, for God's sake. I'm healthy. People see me at work every day. They know that I can deliver. And I have delivered,\" she said.\n\nI really don't think this is an argument in her favor. I mean, in my opinion, it is implicit in her remarks that she knew about Biden's decline and said nothing. And again, what happened with Biden in 2024 and the utter collapse of the Democrat Party machine that followed as they tried and failed to make then-Vice President Kamala Harris a viable presidential candidate is something Dems universally agree they don't want to see happen again with future candidates for higher office.\n\nPlus, Democrats have increasingly made clear in post-2024 races that they want \"fresh blood\" in the fight, not an establishment type who they fear would be reluctant to fight Trump every step of the way.\n\nIf she were to win, Mills would be the \"oldest Senate freshman ever sworn into office.\" She would only be three years younger than Biden when he left office. Also like Biden, Mills' career in public office spans several decades, making her an \"old-timer\" in the eyes of the woke left.\n\nAs CNN put it, \"No other Senate Democratic primary encapsulates the ideological, tactical and generational divides still gripping the Democratic Party than here in Maine.\" It will be interesting to see how this plays out and how it potentially could impact the general election matchup against Collins.\n\nEditor’s Note: The Democrat Party has never been less popular as voters reject its globalist agenda.\n\nPlease help us continue exposing Democrats' plans to lead America down a dangerous path.

She added in her opinion that “leaders have used concern for military readiness to deny marginalized persons the privilege of serving.” \n\n2. Litigating Against Trump\n\nIn a 2018 case that predated her time as a judge, Reyes was on the legal team representing 19 people who crossed the southern border without going through a port of entry. A federal judge in the case said the Trump administration could not automatically deport anyone for not using a port of entry.\n\nThe individuals were represented by the Capital Area Immigrants’ Rights Coalition and the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services.\n\nReyes, then with the firm of Williams and Connolly, told Courthouse News that the ruling was a “huge win for refugees.”\n\n“The ruling is a victory for refugees who want to live safely with their families,” Reyes said. “We’re grateful that the court carefully considered all the issues and issued a detailed, as you’ve seen, 77-page opinion.”\n\n3. Democrat Donor\n\nFederal Election Commission records show that Reyes was a consistent donor to Democrat candidates and liberal political organizations while in private practice. \n\nIn 2020, she gave $2,800 to the Joe Biden presidential campaign, and $5,600 to the Biden Victory Fund, which were legally separate entities.\n\nIn 2019, FEC records show she made six separate $500 donations to the Kamala Harris Democrat primary campaign. In 2016, she made a $2,700 donation to the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign. She also contributed $2,500 to President Barack Obama’s reelection campaign in 2012.\n\nAs first reported by The Federalist last year, she gave more than $1,700 to Defeat by Tweet, which is “a Democratic-aligned super PAC that allows liberal donors to sign up to contribute as little as a penny to liberal groups in battleground states each time Trump made a post a Twitter, the social media platform now known as X. \n\nShe also made numerous donations of less than $100 to the Democrat fundraising platform ActBlue, as well as small donations to Sen. Jon Ossoff, D-Ga., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.\n\n4. ‘Much-Needed Diversity’\n\nDel. Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-D.C., suggested that President Joe Biden nominate Reyes for the D.C. district court.\n\nA Norton press release said, “Reyes will be the first Hispanic woman and first openly LGBTQ person ever to serve on that court.”\n\n“Ana Reyes has the intelligence, temperament, and integrity to be an excellent federal judge,” Norton said in February 2023 after the Senate confirmed Reyes by a vote of 51-47. “She will also bring much-needed diversity to the federal bench. I look forward to her service.”\n\n5. Applying the Rules to Biden DOJ \n\nReyes was not reliably in the Biden administration’s corner after ascending to the court.\n\nIn April 2024, the judge did not allow the Justice Department to ignore subpoenas by the House Judiciary Committee investigating whether prosecutors gave special treatment to President Biden’s son Hunter.\n\nThe committee tried to compel two DOJ tax lawyers, Mark Daly and Jack Morgan, to face a deposition about Hunter Biden. The department resisted.\n\nReyes noted the Justice Department prosecuted former Trump aide Peter Navarro for not responding to a subpoena from the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021 breach of the U.S. Capitol.\n\n“The rules apply to you all too,” Reyes told Justice Department lawyers.\n\n6. Sentencing for Trump Tax Leaker\n\nIn January 2024, Reyes sentenced former Internal Revenue Service consultant Charles Littlejohn to five years in prison for leaking Trump’s tax returns, along with the returns of thousands of other wealthy people.\n\nReyes called the leak of Trump’s tax information, “an attack on our constitutional democracy.”\n\n“When you target the sitting president of the United States, you’re targeting the office and when you’re targeting the office of the president of the United States, you’re targeting democracy — you’re targeting our constitutional system of government,” Reyes said in the sentencing.","summary":"The Joe Biden-appointed judge who halted the Trump administration’s deportation of about 350,000 Haitians has a background as a private Democrat financial supporter, though with...

Will I feel like I’ve missed out on my purpose in life?” she asked rhetorically then. “I know we’re not supposed to say that, but it’s this biological and social programming.” Her song, “I Think About It All the Time,” also explored her complicated feelings about potential motherhood. \n\nJust before the cringe exchange on the podcast, Charli XCX opened up to Bateman and co-hosts Sean Hayes and Will Arnett about how her experience as an only child shaped her as an adult. “I actually think not having siblings actually means that you miss out on a lot of conflict,” she explained. \n\n“And I mean that in like, actually a bad way. Like, I think my friends who have siblings are so much better at conflict, as in they don’t kind of amplify it up into this huge, dramatic thing.

I went there to be a journalist. I went there to chronicle and document and record what was happening … I do think that there is a difference between a protester and a journalist.”\n\nThe appearance arrived less than a week after the former CNN anchor — now an independent journalist who hosts a YouTube show — was arrested by federal agents in Los Angeles following his coverage of an anti-ICE protest at a Minnesota church earlier this month. Lemon, 59, was released without bond Friday and is expected to plead not guilty, according to his attorneys.\n\nOn Monday’s show, Kimmel began the conversation by asking Lemon how he was feeling: “I don’t know — that’s an honest answer,” Lemon said. “I’m OK. I’m not going to let them steal my joy, but this is very serious. These are federal criminal charges.”\n\nLemon was arrested — along with three others in attendance at the protest — at the direction of Attorney General Pam Bondi, who said on X that it was in connection to what she described as a “coordinated attack” on the church, located in St. Paul, Minnesota. Lemon is charged with conspiracy to deprive the church congregants of their rights and interfering by force with someone’s First Amendment rights. Lemon has denied participating in the protest at the church — assembled to decry that an Immigration and Customs Enforcement field officer apparently serves as a pastor there — saying he was present in a journalistic capacity.\n\nPlayfully acknowledging that he hasn’t been a favorite of President Donald Trump’s since his time on CNN, Lemon said he hadn’t been concerned about his possible arrest — even with a repost by Trump calling for it — until it gained steam by members of Trump’s Cabinet, including Bondi and Todd Blanche, the U.S. deputy attorney general. Lemon said that after retaining a lawyer and volunteering to turn himself in to handle the matter without fanfare, he “never heard back from them.”\n\n“That is customary in a situation like this, that someone would be allowed to turn themselves in,” Lemon said. “People who are who are accused of much worse things than I am accused of doing, they are allowed the courtesy. I mean, Donald Trump was allowed the courtesy to turn himself in …”\n\nLemon went on to detail the moments leading up to his arrest Thursday, which came after a night of covering a Grammys event for the Black Music Collective and attending a post-party celebration.\n\n“I got back to the hotel, I walked in with my swag bag from the thing … and I pressed the elevator button and all of a sudden I feel myself being jostled, people trying to grab me and put me in handcuffs,” he recounted. “And I said, ‘What are you doing here?’ And they said, ‘We came to arrest you.’ I said, ‘Who are you?’ Then finally they identified themselves. And I said, ‘If you are who you are, then where’s the warrant?’ And they didn’t have a warrant, so they had to wait for the someone from outside, an FBI guy, to come in to show me a warrant on a cellphone … They took me outside FBI guys were out there. It had to be maybe a dozen people, which is a waste, Jimmy, of resources … They want to embarrass you. They want to intimidate you. They want to instill fear.”\n\nHe said he hadn’t realized how much attention his arrest had generated until he saw CNN broadcasting the story on a TV monitor where he was being held.\n\n“I could see ‘Former CNN anchor Don Lemon arrested in Los Angeles,’” he said. “I said to the guy, ‘Is that happening a lot?’ He goes, ‘You’ve been on all morning, yeah. And he says, ‘This is a big deal.’”\n\nDuring the conversation, Kimmel criticized what he felt was a lack of attention to the recent search by FBI agents of the home of a Washington Post reporter who covers the federal government. Lemon, who parted ways with CNN in 2023, attributed it to a fear among the leaders of corporate press enterprises.\n\n“Corporate media has been neutered right now. They are afraid, and that’s the reason I’m so happy with what I do, because I’m closer to the ground,” he said. “This is not time for folly. It’s not time for false equivalence, and putting people on television and on news programs, giving them a platform, who come on just to lie. …. Some things are objectively bad and I think its important in this time to point that out.”\n\nLemon hitting the late-night circuit intensifies its spotlight as a free-speech battleground. The Trump era has prompted more pointed and passionate takes from most of the major hosts that, in turn, have captured the attention and ire of the president, who has provoked threats against them and their broadcasters.\n\nLast year, CBS announced it was canceling “The Late Show” after a three-decade run — a decision the company attributed to financial reasons and not, as many have speculated, because of host Stephen Colbert’s criticism of a settlement between the Trump administration and Paramount, the parent company of CBS, over a 2024 “60 Minutes” interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nMore recently, Kimmel faced a brief suspension last fall over comments regarding the killing of right-wing activist and influencer Charlie Kirk (ABC ultimately reinstated Kimmel following public backlash.) In fact, Lemon referenced that situation prior to his arrest, when a judge dismissed prosecutors’ initial charging effort: “This is not a victory lap for me because it’s not over. They’re gonna try again,” Lemon told his followers on his YouTube show after the judge’s ruling. “Go ahead, make me into the new Jimmy Kimmel, if you want.”\n\nLast Friday, addressing a crowd outside the courthouse upon his release, Lemon said, “There is no more important time than right now, this very moment, for a free and independent media that shines a light on the truth and holds those in power accountable. I will not stop now, I will not stop ever.”","url":"https://www.baltimoresun.com/2026/02/03/don-lemon-makes-post-arrest-appearance-on-jimmy-kimmel-live-they-want-to-instill-fear/","image":"https://www.baltimoresun.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/202602031023MCT_____PHOTO____ENTER-TV-KIMMEL-LEMON-FILEPIC-GET.jpg?w=1024&h=683","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-03 17:19:39","author":null,"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.405},{"id":399121440,"title":"CNN Admits ‘Voter ID Is Not Controversial in This Country’ - Even Among Minorities","text":"Despite fearmongering by Democrats, such as Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY), who claim requiring a photo ID to vote is racist, the voter integrity requirement has strong support among minorities, CNN Data Analyst Harry Enten noted Tuesday.\n\n“What’s the racial breakdown on this, right?

Debbie Dingell, D-Ann Arbor, told the Free Press on Tuesday, Feb. 3. \"There are little signs already that they want to do that. I've talked to the governor and we need to pull together as senior leaders and make sure we protect the freedom of our ballot box.\"\n\nDingell wasn't alone: Contacted by the Free Press, U.S. Rep. Shri Thanedar, D-Detroit, said Trump \"is testing the waters,\" arguing the people who support him are \"willing to break the law and act unconstitutionally to keep power.\"\n\n\"It's clear they will be more than happy to take away Detroiters voting rights,\" he said. \"I'm fighting this administration every day in Congress.\"\n\nAppearing on former FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino's podcast, Trump continued to press claims that he lost the 2020 election due to Democratic corruption, despite the fact that numerous lawsuits, audits, reports and probes by state and federal officials (including his own) showed no evidence of any widespread voter fraud.\n\nTrump, of course, also won the 2024 election over Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, beating her in many of the states he lost four years earlier to Joe Biden, including Michigan, where he insisted repeatedly he really won even though an investigation of the election led by Republican state legislators showed no widespread fraud.\n\nThis year's midterm elections will help determine which party holds majority control of the U.S. House and Senate. In Michigan, a new governor, secretary of state and attorney general will also be elected.\n\n\"The Republicans should say, 'We want to take over. We should take over the voting in at least ‒ many, 15 places,'\" Trump told Bongino. \"The Republicans ought to nationalize the voting. We have states that are so crooked.\"\n\nTrump didn't detail which places he was talking about and what nationalizing the voting would look like or how Republicans would do so. The Constitution gives the authority of administering federal elections to the states. But Trump's Justice Department has clearly taken a strong interest in voting issues, suing Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson for a complete copy of the state's voter rolls, including personal voter data (which Benson compared to a \"power grab\").\n\nOn Jan. 28, the FBI searched and seized 2020 voting records from a site in Fulton County, Georgia, another state that Trump lost in the 2020 election but claimed to have really won.\n\nThe White House didn't respond to a question as to whether Michigan or Detroit might be part of the list of \"15 places\" Trump referenced. A spokeswoman for the administration said, however, that Trump is committed to protecting voter integrity, without directly referencing Trump's comment about Republicans nationalizing elections.\n\n“President Trump cares deeply about the safety and security of our elections − that’s why he’s urged Congress to pass the SAVE Act (which would require proof of U.S. citizenship to vote in federal elections) and other legislative proposals that would establish a uniform standard of photo ID for voting, prohibit no-excuse mail-in voting and end the practice of ballot harvesting (where groups collect executed absentee ballots and turn them in to elections officials),\" said White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson.\n\nNon-citizen voting in federal and state elections is already illegal across the U.S., however, and despite Republican claims to the contrary, there is no evidence that fraudulent voting by non-citizens is widespread.\n\nNeither Benson nor some other top state Democrats, including Michigan's two U.S. senators, immediately responded to the Free Press for comment on Trump's remarks. But Cheri Hardmon, spokeswoman for the Secretary of State's Office, reaffirmed the primacy of the state in administering elections.\n\n\"The U.S. Constitution puts states in charge of elections, not the federal government,\" she said. \"That's the law.\"\n\nAfter the 2020 election, Trump railed that he had really won Michigan, raising false claims of mysterious ballots being delivered in the middle of the night to the vote-counting center at what was then TCF Center in Detroit and of more votes being cast in Detroit than there are people.

The SAVE Act is legislation that requires voters to provide proof of citizenship to vote. Pretty simple, no?\n\nNot to Democrats, who act like something as common as ID is unfair to minorities. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer issued a statement on X, in which he goes full condescension and treats minorities as if they’re too stupid or inept to procure identification. It reads in part:\n\nI have said it before and I'll say it again, the SAVE Act would impose Jim Crow type laws to the entire country and is dead on arrival in the Senate. It is a poison pill that will kill any legislation that it is attached to. If House Republicans add the SAVE Act to the bipartisan appropriations package it will lead to another prolonged Trump government shutdown.Let's be clear, the SAVE Act is not about securing our elections. It is about suppressing voters. The SAVE Act seeks to disenfranchise millions of American citizens, seize control of our elections, and fan the flames of election skepticism and denialism.The SAVE Act is reminiscent of Jim Crow era laws and would expand them to the whole of America. Republicans want to restore Jim Crow and apply it from one end of this country to the other.\n\nThe “Jim Crow” canard really grinds my gears because the left spouted it so much when Georgia enacted its law making elections more secure. What’s funny is that turnout increased in Georgia, including among minorities.\n\nFlashback: If Georgia's New Voting Law Was 'Jim Crow 2.0,' It's Bizarro Jim Crow\n\nIt also reminds me of one of my favorite columns that I’ve written in recent years. When Kamala Harris said that voter ID laws were “unfair” to rural people, I wrote, “I do declare that it’s tougher than rasslin’ a greased hog in a phone booth for Maw and Paw to hitch the mule up to the wagon to head up to the big city to get one of them thar fancy identification cards. It’s the 21st century, for crying out loud.”\n\nThat was a fun one. But I digress.\n\nLeave it to the awesome Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) to call Schumer out for his racism:\n\nHere we go again….according to @SenSchumer it’s racist to ensure only American citizens vote in our elections.After Biden & Schumer allowed MILLIONS of illegal aliens to flood into the U.S., the SAVE America Act is essential to stop Soros-backed Leftist radicals from using… https://t.co/jdjF6X9pXQ— Rick Scott (@SenRickScott) February 2, 2026\n\nAnd Scott wasn’t alone:\n\nWeird, so you're saying Black people can't do any of the things on the left of this picture.Chuck, this isn't the 60's you know, the era you started in politics?RETIRE!!! pic.twitter.com/QpEluADfF5— FloridaManStan (@FLManStan) February 2, 2026\n\nThe bottom line is that Democrats don’t want secure elections. They don’t want to ensure that only those who should be voting are voting. Election integrity makes it much more difficult for Democrats to game the system in their favor.\n\nThere’s a simple solution, and Elon Musk pointed it out:\n\nVoter ID and in-person voting is the only way to save democracy— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 2, 2026\n\nAmen. Let’s make our elections secure and free of Democrat corruption.\n\nWho exactly do Democrats think can’t get an ID?\n\nThe left’s hysterical “Jim Crow” attacks on the SAVE Act aren’t about protecting voters—they’re about protecting power.

For a brief period of time, I accompanied FBI Deputy Director Bailey and Atlanta Acting Special Agent in Charge Pete Ellis in observing FBI personnel executing that search warrant, issued by the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia pursuant to a probable cause finding. My presence was requested by the President and executed by my broad statutory authority to coordinate, integrate, and analyze intelligence related to election security, including counterintelligence (CI), foreign and other malign influence and cybersecurity. The FBI’s Intelligence/Counterintelligence divisions are one of 18 elements that I oversee.In twelve FBI Field Offices across the country, including the Atlanta Field Office, the senior FBI official (Assistant Director in Charge or Special Agent in Charge) is dual-hatted as my Domestic DNI-Representative. The Domestic DNI-Rep program was established in 2011 through a Memorandum of Understanding between the ODNI and FBI. Domestic DNI-Reps are distributed by region and focus on specific domestic issues of concern or interest, including threats to critical infrastructure. I have visited several of my Domestic DNI-Reps at FBI Field Offices across the country. While visiting the FBI Field Office in Atlanta, I thanked the FBI agents for their professionalism and great work, and facilitated a brief phone call for the President to thank the agents personally for their work. He did not ask any questions, nor did he issue any directives.\n\nGabbard went on to lay out her answers to the questions posed by Mark Warner and James Himes, saying that election security \"is a national security issue.\"\n\n\"Interference in U.S. elections is a threat to our republic and a national security threat. The President and his Administration are committed to safeguarding the integrity of U.S. elections to ensure that neither foreign nor domestic powers undermine the American people’s right to determine who our elected leaders are,\" Gabbard wrote. Gabbard also said the Director of National Intelligence has \"broad authority\" related to election security.\n\nGabbard also noted that the National Security Act of 1947 says that the \"congressional accountability requirements of that Act do not require that the President obtain approval from the congressional intelligence committees before initiating a significant intelligence activity,\" noting the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia issued the Fulton County search warrant under seal. \"I have not seen the warrant or the evidence of probable cause that the DOJ submitted to the Court for approval,\" Gabbard wrote. \"Therefore, the ODNI had no ability, authority, or responsibility to inform the Committees about the search warrant ahead of its execution.\"\n\nNot a coincidence that they are trying to smear you just days after the raid in Fulton County.You must be over the target.— Clandestine (@WarClandestine) February 3, 2026\n\nIt's not a coincidence at all, and it wouldn't be the first time. Early last year, Gabbard told Fox News she believed she was included in the \"Quiet Skies\" surveillance program after she criticized then-Vice President Kamala Harris and the Biden administration.\n\n“I think they were trying to intimidate me, but also, they were trying to really create this chilling effect…send a message out to people that if you go and criticize then-Vice President Kamala Harris…you too, would face consequences,” Gabbard told Laura Ingraham at the time.\n\nEditor’s Note: The Democrat Party has never been less popular as voters reject its globalist agenda.\n\nHelp us continue exposing Democrats' plans to lead America down a dangerous path.

Donald Trump and his allies speak reverentially about law enforcement even as the president has pardoned Jan. 6 rioters convicted of assaulting police officers. Trump has called that day a “lovefest,” but reserves no such language for anti-ICE protests.\n\nThe past few weeks in Minneapolis, where citizens have stood up to the surge of federal agents enforcing Trump’s immigration crackdown, have put in stark relief whose rights the administration considers most important — and whose are treated as disposable.\n\nLemon reported on an anti-ICE protest at a St. Paul church earlier this month, filming the event and conducting interviews, precisely the work a journalist would be expected to do. Now, Lemon, whom Trump has previously mocked as a “loser,” a “lightweight” and “the dumbest man on television,” is being charged with conspiracy to deprive others of their constitutional rights.\n\nThe journalist is also being accused of violating the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act, which in part prevents one from interfering with someone’s First Amendment right of religious freedom. Trump has previously pardoned anti-abortion activists convicted under the FACE Act.\n\nThe Trump White House could have at least feigned respect for press freedom, framing the arrest of a journalist in sober terms. Instead, the White House mocked the former CNN anchor’s arrest on X, writing, “When life gives you lemons,” complete with a chains emoji.\n\nSuch a callous message is jarring, though not unexpected, coming from the Trump administration. In Minnesota, federal officials also moved quickly to cast suspicion on Renee Good and Alex Pretti after they were killed by Border Patrol agents, even as video and witness accounts contradicted those early descriptions of events. \n\nAbbe Lowell, Lemon’s attorney, pointed to the administration’s priorities when it comes to justice and accountability. \n\n“Instead of investigating the federal agents who killed two peaceful Minnesota protesters, the Trump Justice Department is devoting its time, attention and resources to this arrest, and that is the real indictment of wrongdoing in this case,” he said. “This unprecedented attack on the First Amendment and transparent attempt to distract attention from the many crises facing this administration will not stand.”\n\nWhile the First Amendment is under threat, Trump has spoken less protectively about the Second Amendment. \n\nTrump said Pretti —who was holding a phone when approached by agents and already disarmed when he was shot dead —“shouldn’t have been carrying a gun,” effectively faulting the intensive-care nurse for exercising a right conservatives typically consider sacrosanct. Trump even described Pretti as an “agitator” and possibly an “insurrectionist.”\n\nThat depiction stands in sharp contrast to Trump’s treatment of Kyle Rittenhouse, who, at 17, carried an AR-15-style rifle at a racial justice protest and fatally killed two people. Trump congratulated Rittenhouse after a jury acquitted him of homicide. \n\nThe message through all this appears less about upholding the law and more about enforcing loyalty.\n\n“I will not be silenced”\n\nWhen Don Lemon emerged from a Los Angeles federal courthouse on Friday, he vowed to continue reporting the news. \n\n“I have spent my entire career covering the news. I will not stop now,” Lemon said. “In fact, there is no more important time than right now, this very moment, for a free and independent media that shines a light on the truth and holds those in power accountable.\n\n“The DOJ sent a team of federal agents to arrest me in the middle of the night, for something that I’ve been doing for the last 30 years — and that is covering the news,” he added. “The First Amendment of the Constitution protects that work for me, and for countless other journalists who do what I do. I stand with all of them. And I will not be silenced.”\n\nJournalists, lawmakers and press freedom advocates widely condemned the arrest Lemon under federal charges of conspiracy and interference with the constitutional right to religious freedom. (Another independent journalist, Georgia Fort, was also charged.)\n\n“The First Amendment is under attack in America!” said former CNN colleague Jim Acosta.\n\nSeth Stern, the director of advocacy at the Freedom of the Press Foundation, said the arrests of Lemon and independent journalist Georgia Fort amounted to “naked attacks on freedom of the press.”\n\n“These arrests under bogus legal theories for obviously constitutionally protected reporting are clear warning shots aimed at other journalists,” Stern said. “The unmistakable message is that journalists must tread cautiously because the government is looking for any way to target them.\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom posted on X: “They raided a reporter’s home earlier this month. Today, they arrested journalists. They are coming for you. Speak out.”\n\nCorbin Bolies has more on the Lemon arrest, which follows the Trump administration seizing a Washington Post reporter’s devices at her home earlier this month as part of a leak investigation. \n\nCheck out Bolies’ piece: With Don Lemon’s Arrest, Trump Escalates War on the Press\n\nPlus: Don Lemon Thought He Was Being Mugged During Arrest, His Attorney Says | Video\n\nPosties plead with Jeff Bezos\n\nSpeaking of the Washington Post, journalists throughout the newsroom are pleading with owner Jeff Bezos not to make steep cuts at the paper amid rumored layoffs targeting the international, sports and metro desk. \n\nThe public appeals speak to fears inside the paper that significant cuts are on the horizon — particularly in international coverage — and reflect growing doubts about whether Bezos, the Amazon founder reportedly worth around $250 billion, remains fully invested in supporting the paper. \n\nIn conversations with TheWrap, staffers expressed frustration with Bezos’ seeming distance from the paper, as well as with CEO and publisher Will Lewis, whose widely touted “third newsroom” initiative never gained traction amid broader upheaval during his two-year tenure. They also fault management for the loss of hundreds of thousands of subscribers after the paper spiked a 2024 endorsement of Kamala Harris. “If their answer to those losses is to take it out on staff now, what are we doing?” asked a staffer. \n\n“The lack of communication has left folks twisting in the wind,” another staffer told TheWrap.\n\nMore in my piece: Inside an Anxious Washington Post, With Eyes on Jeff Bezos\n\nAlso on the WaPo/Bezos front: \n\nAdvice for Bari Weiss\n\nBari Weiss, the embattled editor in chief of CBS News, took the opportunity last week to lay out her vision for the network. She vowed to earn the trust of the newsroom, while offering a blunt message to staff “We have to start by looking honestly at ourselves,” she said. “We are not producing a product that enough people want.”\n\nTheWrap Editor-in-Chief Sharon Waxman closely read Weiss’ remarks and offered some advice to the novice TV executive:\n\n“I’ve read the speech a couple of times, seeking to grab hold of a central theme, a clear plan. Weiss is right about framing the problem she needs to solve: CBS News has been busy hanging on to its shrinking, older audience, and failing. Instead, she argues, CBS News needs to be about the business of embracing the 21st century by expanding its core, by finding potential new, young viewers where they are – on YouTube, streaming apps, social media and podcasts.”\n\nWeiss can diagnose the problem, but the real question is can she fix it?\n\nRead Waxman’s full piece: Letter to Bari Weiss: Soaring Words for CBS, but Your Solutions Are Fuzzy\n\nPlus: CBS News Offers Buyouts to Some ‘Evening News’ Staff After Bari Weiss Lays Out Network Vision\n\nTucker Carlson’s evolution\n\nFor years, journalists have privately — and publicly — asked what happened to Tucker Carlson? How did one of the most talented magazine writers morph into a right-wing firebrand, hosting what the New York Times described as “what may be the most racist show in the history of cable news.” The media is flush with deep dives on the matter, from the Columbia Journalism Review (“The Mystery of Tucker Carlson”) to the Atlantic (“What Does Tucker Carlson Believe?”). \n\nBiographer Jason Zengerle, wisely, isn’t promising to solve the riddle, acknowledging in an interview that he doesn’t have “a satisfactory answer” when it comes to Carlson’s psyche. What Zengerle aimed to do, he said, was to explore the “incentive structure in conservative media and in conservative politics over the past 30 years that influenced his decisions and influenced the way he went.”\n\nRead my full interview with Zengerle, author of the new book, “Hated By All the Right People.”\n\nAlso on TheWrap\n\nKayla Cobb and Corbin Bolies report:\n\nTikTok’s new ownership is off to a rough start. After six years of executive orders and legal battles about whether or not TikTok will be able to exist in the U.S., chaos defined the platform’s first weekend under its new owners as users found themselves unable to post videos and see view counts.\n\nThe widespread disruption on Jan. 25 came on the heels of a federal Border Patrol agent in Minnesota killing intensive-care nurse Alex Pretti, sparking the latest political firestorm among creators rallying against the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in the state. But as users found themselves unable to speak out on the social media platform, the outage led to a wave of public departures and accusations that the app was censoring political content, even as the company blamed a power issue with one of its partner data center sites.\n\nCheck out the full piece: TikTok’s Early Outage Heightens Censorship and Monetization Concerns: ‘It’s Terrifying’","summary":"Targeting Lemon threatens the First Amendment and speaks volumes about the Trump administration’s priorities.

Christian Menefee of Texas, the newest member of Congress, started the job Monday – and now has just four weeks to convince Houston voters he already deserves reelection.\n\nThe candidate Menefee defeated on Saturday, Amanda Edwards, also is running again for the 18th District seat in next month’s Democratic primary. So is Rep. Al Green, who for decades represented a district nearby but now finds himself living in a newly drawn 18th. \n\nThe back-to-back elections are among the head-spinning electoral oddities that voters in heavily Democratic Houston have experienced in recent months. \n\nFor nearly a year, the district’s residents had no representative in the U.S. House after their member died. And before voters could select a successor, the Texas Legislature redrew the state’s congressional maps to help Republicans’ midterm election prospects, further complicating things and raising concerns about disenfranchising voters in the predominantly Black and Hispanic district. \n\n“It has been exhausting. Voters are confused. Voters are tired,” said Shamier Bouie, chairwoman of Black American Democrats of Houston. “Even people who are pretty politically savvy, it’s still confusing for them.”\n\nTaken together, voters’ questions surrounding this pileup of elections and the new House boundaries mark an unwieldy start to the 2026 midterm campaigns for control of Congress. Texas’ March 3 primary will be the first using a new U.S. House map drawn at the start of a national redistricting battle spurred by President Donald Trump. \n\nShampu Sibley, who voted Wednesday at Wheeler Avenue Baptist Church, decried the mid-decade redistricting as “a political move” by the GOP-led Texas Legislature.\n\nThe 62-year-old novelist, who lives within the current boundaries of the 18th District, was uncertain if his home will still be in the 18th on the new map.\n\n“We’re not going to say they want to steal elections, but they make it very hard for the Black and brown communities to vote,” he said.\n\nA long-vacant seat\n\nThe current 18th District is a Democratic stronghold in a Republican state. In 2024, Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris won about 69% of the vote. So did the late Rep. Sylvester Turner, who died in March 2025. \n\nAfter Turner’s death, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott set an all-party primary to fill the seat for eight months later, suggesting it would take Harris County elections officials months to prepare for the vote. Democrats accused Abbott of delaying the vote to help Republican House leader Mike Johnson pass legislation with a thin GOP majority.\n\nWhen none of the 16 candidates won a majority in November, the race advanced to Saturday’s runoff, which Menefee won. \n\nEdwards and Menefee have been vocal in their criticism of leaving the 18th District, including large tracts of the nation’s fourth-largest city, without representation.\n\nIn particular, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have been active for months in Houston, which has received less publicity than cities such as Chicago, Los Angeles and now Minneapolis, in part because of the empty seat, Edwards said.\n\n“If there was advocacy, if there was use of a bully pulpit to get people together and really walk in unison around an issue of justice, this seat was it,” she said. “To have it silenced is not a coincidence.” \n\nNew maps to help Trump\n\nMeanwhile, the GOP-controlled Texas Legislature in August adopted redrawn congressional maps at the direction of Trump, who has warned Republicans that if they lose control of the U.S. House in November he will be impeached again. Some other states, including heavily Democratic California, later drew their own new maps. \n\nThe 18th District, which is centered around Houston and entirely in Harris County in southeast Texas, was divided among nearly a half-dozen districts. The largest share of the population in the current 18th district will become part of a different district. \n\nThat means Menefee and Edwards are turning around and running in a district that includes some new territory. They also will face yet another candidate in Green, an 11-term Democratic congressman whose Houston home was included in a new, Republican-leaning district, prompting him last year to announce plans to run in the the Democratic-leaning new 18th District. \n\nIt has set up a generational battle between Green, who is 78, and Menefee, the 37-year-old former county attorney, and Edwards, a 44-year-old former Houston city councilwoman. \n\nOverlapping elections add to confusion \n\nMenefee and Edwards said they had spent as much time answering voter questions in an effort to help voters keep the timing straight as they had talking about their policy positions.\n\n“There have been times where I’ve shown up at community centers and somebody will say, ’Why haven’t you come to my neighborhood or my church? And I’ll say, ‘Where do you go to church at?’” Menefee said, only to learn the person lives in the new 18th District. “That has happened to me at least a dozen times.”\n\nLast week, Houston lawyer and Democratic activist Brandon Cofield met a man who had visited his local polling place hoping to vote in the March 3 primary, thinking the early voting period had begun, only to be turned away. \n\nBecause Abbott scheduled the vacancy elections so late in 2025 and 2026, they ended up colliding with the start of the 2026 midterm elections, for the next term that will start in 2027.\n\nNot only were voters seeing campaign signs for the March 3 primary before the Saturday runoff, Harris County began sending out mail-in ballots for the new district primary two weeks before the runoff was finished. \n\n“You literally had people who could vote in two different elections at the same time,” Edwards said. “These elections aren’t just back to back. They overlap.” \n\nThat meant that even as Edwards was urging voters to get out for Saturday’s election, her team had to be looking ahead to the March 3 primary to meet filing deadlines in the new district. \n\nSome voters have grown dispirited\n\nMenefee said he’s been trying to encourage people to stay engaged. \n\nIt has “definitely made people feel like they can be a pawn in a game,” he said. “I think it has demoralized some people.”\n\nTobin Hellums, a 57-year-old Houston entrepreneur, said he was confused because his normal early-voting location was different for the runoff. Harris County elections officials offered fewer early-voting stations because the ballot included only one race. \n\n“The overall process was completely confusing,” Hellums said.\n\nNatural forces have also contributed.\n\nThe Sunday before the runoff, Bouie’s group had planned to blitz 10 of Houston’s best-known Black churches to run through details of the coming election sequence for parishioners. With multiple services that day, she was looking at reaching thousands of voters in the district.\n\nThen a winter storm hit, closing the churches. Early voting was extended by two days to make up for the weather-related shutdown of polling places. But that also forced early run-off voting to overlap more with primary mail-in voting. \n\nMore election drama may lie ahead. The March 3 Democratic primary ballot will have four names: Menefee, Edwards, Green and Gretchen Brown, a veteran Defense Department senior staffer. If no candidate receives a majority of the vote, the race will move to a May runoff election. \n\n“It feels like it’s going to go on forever,” Bouie said. \n\nBeaumont reported from Des Moines, Iowa.","url":"https://apnews.com/article/texas-house-redistricting-menefee-democrats-700cfaf4bd87a6905c4170ef3e478d9b","image":"https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/20960cc/2147483647/strip/false/crop/3300x2374+0+0/resize/980x705!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fb3%2F40%2F429ac3789d710fe3d42350420134%2Fdafa2e5104064e1aa89f0c11d4226b49","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-03 13:46:49","author":"Thomas Beaumont","authors":["Thomas Beaumont"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.026},{"id":398975496,"title":"James Carville reveals his 2028 pick — which Democrat he thinks should run for President","text":"Global Desk\n\nVeteran political strategist James Carville has shared his perspective on which Democrat he believes has the strongest chance of winning the White House in the 2028 presidential election.He offered his views during a recent episode of Raymond Arroyo’s show Arroyo Grande, Carville was asked directly which Democrat he could watch “carrying the flag” for the party heading into the next election cycle. His answers were direct.Carville Quickly Dismisses Several High-Profile DemocratsWhen former Vice President Kamala Harris was cited, Carville dismissed the concept outright. He provided the same reaction when Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was held up. However, when Arroyo referenced former U.S. Ambassador Rahm Emanuel, Carville indicated Emanuel could still have a role, forecasting that “he’ll have an effect on the dialogue.”From there, Carville described that his thinking is driven by two certain requirements he believes are important for a Democratic nominee.Live EventsThe Two Criteria Carville Says Matter MostAccording to Carville, a strong Democratic candidate must first be able to raise a huge amount of funds early in the campaign. Second, that candidate must be able to walk into a Black establishment and receive a warm reception.As per the fundraising ability alone, Carville narrowed the list to California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker. When factoring in acceptance within Black communities, however, only one contender remained.Why JB Pritzker Emerged as the FavoriteThe talks then turned to Pritzker, initiating a candid exchange between Carville and Arroyo:CARVILLE: If I had to say one guy — I really don’t know him very superficially — but if I were like betting the Kentucky Derby and I saw this 12-to-1 horse and I said, “Yeah, I want to get a price,” I’d take JB Pritzker. ARROYO: Really? Why? CARVILLE: Well– ARROYO: Not Kamala Harris? She’s Black! CARVILLE: She has no chance. ARROYO: Why not? CARVILLE: Because no Democrat wants anything to do with anybody that had anything to do with 2024. Not that we dislike them. This is not what we’re doing. And I don’t think there’s no enthusiasm. I mean, look, if you do a poll and you say for 2028, it’s Kamala Harris, Joe Biden, any name they heard of. Well, the person they heard of is always going to be on, but that’s meaningless. ARROYO: That doesn’t mean anything.Carville’s View on the 2024 FalloutCarville mentioned his belief that Democrats are eager to move previous figures connected with the 2024 election loss.“No Democrat wants anything to do with anybody that had anything to do with 2024,” he said. “Not that we dislike them — that’s not what this is. There’s no enthusiasm.”He also rejected the value of familiarity-driven polling, stating:“If you do a poll and you say for 2028 it’s Kamala Harris, Joe Biden, any name they’ve heard of, the person they’ve heard of is always going to be on top. But that’s meaningless.”How Other Democrats CompareCarville admitted that Newsom and Shapiro could also offer significant early fundraising, but said neither matched Pritzker’s blend offend , visibility, and grassroots acceptance.While Carville continues to be skeptical, Harris now leads early polling, followed by Newsom, former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, and Ocasio-Cortez.FAQs:Q1.

Two cases, in particular, have had an immediate effect in North Texas.\n\nOne program provided $7 billion to boost solar energy creation. The other provided $3 billion in community grants to combat various environmental issues, including air quality. \n\nEnvironmental justice advocates say that, in the past, vulnerable communities viewed the federal government as an ally to overcome roadblocks with local and state governments to access resources.\n\nNow, nonprofits and local governments in Texas and across the country are suing the EPA for terminating and clawing back money from programs that already awarded grants.\n\nOne of these was the Solar for All program, created by the former President Joe Biden’s administration under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The act allocated $27 billion for the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund to lower energy costs for families, create higher-paying jobs in communities that have been left behind, advance environmental justice and tackle the climate crisis.\n\nThe program was designed to channel $7 billion in competitive grants toward residential solar projects for low-income and disadvantaged households nationwide, including initiatives focused on workforce development and energy affordability. \n\nIn 2024, a coalition of nonprofits and government entities in Texas had won nearly $250 million in Solar for All funding. Dallas County was awarded $41 million. \n\nIn August 2025, the EPA announced it was canceling the program after Congress passed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, removing the agency’s authority to administer the program. \n\nEarly last year, the EPA announced the creation of the Powering the Great American Comeback Initiative.\n\nA spokesperson for the EPA did not respond to questions about specific programs. \n\nThe spokesperson, who would not be identified, issued a statement via email noting problems identified by the Inspector General with oversight of grant funding. The spokesperson also said the Trump EPA, under Lee Zeldin, is helping North Texas communities through various programs and grants. \n\n“The Trump EPA is committed to its core mission of protecting human health and the environment. Ensuring that the agency’s resources are actually being used to secure clean air, land and water for all Americans, not as handouts to the previous administration’s political benefactors, is key to fulfilling that mission.”\n\nIn December, the EPA approved a $315 million loan for the city of Fort Worth to upgrade wastewater collection and treatment under the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act program. Also, another $4.8 million loan from the Solid Waste Infrastructure for Recycling grant program. \n\nThe loan will fund the construction of the Mary’s Creek Water Reclamation Facility in Fort Worth, said Mary Gugliuzza, the city’s water department spokesperson. \n\nThe project, expected to start construction late this summer and be completed by late 2029, will accommodate growth on the city’s west side. \n\n“It’s a win for our ratepayers because of the low interest rate,” Gugliuzza said. “It will save us some money on interest rates, and we can defer when we start repaying the loan until after the project is in service.” \n\nThe EPA said via email, the previous administration “was more focused on throwing money out the door than spending hard-earned American taxpayer dollars with integrity. The Solar for All program was operating with layers and layers of passthroughs, each taking their own cut of the money.” \n\nFor North Texans already engaged in solar workforce training, the sudden policy reversal has been disorienting. \n\nLack of green job opportunities \n\nGreen Careers Texas in Dallas worked with community organizations to help disrupt poverty by training North Texans for higher-wage careers in solar installation. \n\nAfter nine years, the nonprofit organization decided to shut down following Solar for All’s termination. \n\nTracy Wallace, founder of Green Career Texas, said her organization was awarded about $440,000 over three years to train about 120 people. \n\nWallace, who also serves on the Dallas Environmental Commission, said her organization was too small to continue operating without the grant. \n\nJonathan Dwight Huell, 27, is one of those folks who benefited from the Green Career Texas program. \n\nDwight Huell, a former inmate, was connected to Green Career Texas after completing the Prison Entrepreneurship Program at James Lynaugh Unit in West Texas. \n\nBefore serving time, he held sporadic jobs. At one point, he worked in a warehouse, but never received any training. \n\nCompleting the solar installation training program allowed Dwight Huell to land a job in the green energy sector, to learn to be responsible and to work in something that made him proud.\n\n“Going up and down the ladder and getting on top of that roof, you can see the whole view of the city sometimes — the sky, the wind blowing in your face,” Dwight Huell said. “I was actually having fun. I wasn’t like, ‘Oh, this is hard work.’ It was more like I was enjoying myself the whole time I was doing it, and still, I’m creating something, basically with my hands. You can feel proud about that.” \n\nPrior to the training, participants were required to complete a 10-hour online course from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. The hands-on training took place over the course of two days. Participants were taught about the basics of solar energy, installation techniques and safety measures. Once completed, they were paired with local contractors and other nonprofit organizations to find jobs. \n\nDwight Huell said as federal support dried up, opportunities have “thinned out,” and many initiatives have paused or disappeared. He is also worried about the lack of opportunities that others like him might no longer have access to. \n\n“This is stuff you want to be able to pass down so that other people can catch on and try to shape their character into a better person in general; it’s more than just working a job,” Dwight Huell said. “This is gaining character. This is gaining a sense of self. That’s what I believe, because they’ve done it for me. It’s more than a job.” \n\nWallace said the program’s termination threatens clean energy jobs, energy cost savings and grid resilience for all Texans, but vulnerable communities are at a higher risk. \n\nJonathon Bazan, Dallas County assistant administrator, said via email Solar for All created a one-time opportunity for states and local governments to bring renewable energy to families who are typically left out of those investments, and the Commissioners Court stepped in to make sure communities did not miss it. \n\n“While providing renewable energy solutions is not a core county function,” Bazan said, “this federal program was specifically designed to allow counties to help close that gap using federal dollars.” \n\nLegal battle\n\nThe termination has also spawned legal challenges. \n\nHarris County, recipient of one of the largest Solar for All awards and leader of the Texas Solar for All Coalition, which included Dallas County, Austin and other Texas municipalities, has filed a federal lawsuit seeking to restore its roughly $54 million grant, arguing the EPA lacked authority to scrap the funding after it was awarded. \n\nJonathan Fombonne, Harris County attorney, told The News the EPA used the One Big, Beautiful Bill Act as its justification to terminate the grant. \n\nBut Fombonne argues this is legally incorrect because the bill cancels future appropriations and future grants, but does not cancel grants that have already been awarded. \n\n“Harris County led a coalition of different government entities around Texas in applying for this grant, and a lot of money was supposed to come, and a lot of work was done to prepare to receive that money and get these projects off the ground,” Fombonne said. “And so to have that yanked away like that was pretty dramatic.” \n\nHarris County’s lawsuit against the EPA is currently in discovery. The county plans to seek summary judgment later this year after dropping its initial request for a preliminary injunction under an agreement that freezes the grant funds until a ruling is made.\n\nThese projects target communities that often face higher pollution burdens and less investment. Without the grant, those neighborhoods miss out on cleaner air, climate resilience and related health benefits, said Fombonne. \n\n“We needed a coalition of both red and blue cities and counties in Texas and nonprofits, and all of us were counting on this money coming in to do the work that really our state government should also be supporting and just isn’t doing,” Fombonne said. “So we thought it was important, as the largest county in Texas, to do the work that our state isn’t doing.”\n\nA dozen states filed a separate lawsuit against the EPA seeking to restore $7 billion in Solar for All grants. A federal judge ruled Jan. 13 that the Trump administration acted illegally when it canceled the clean energy grants for projects in states that voted for Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.\n\nThe EPA said via email, “The Solar for All program was operating with layers and layers of passthroughs, each taking their own cut of the money. The Inspector General’s office found that recipients of the program may even have been paid through multiple agreements for the same work.”\n\n“Biden’s EPA obligated $7 billion before any standard operating procedures for the program were even developed, and no quality assurance measures were in place for 83% of the recipients — even as money was being shoveled over. The days of wasteful Biden-era boondoggles are over, and the Trump EPA is committed to being an exceptional steward of taxpayer dollars,” read the statement. \n\nPublic health \n\nThe fight over clean energy funding parallels another legal battle in North Texas focused on air quality monitoring. \n\nDownwinders at Risk, an environmental advocacy group in Dallas, and other plaintiffs are suing the EPA over its termination of environmental justice grants that funded community air monitors. \n\nAdvocates say residents rely on these tools to track pollution near industrial facilities and engage in planning and enforcement. \n\nCaleb Roberts, the director of Downwinders at Risk, said once again, the most vulnerable and polluted communities are left behind. \n\n“Because we don’t have the avenues or the vehicle to get that hard data, residents are going to continue to be ignored by their city councils,” Roberts said. “They’re going to continue paying the price of living next to polluters who can get away with contaminating children and families.”\n\nThe suit alleges the EPA’s actions violated federal law by effectively undoing a congressional directive. \n\nIn 2022, the Biden administration launched a new national office within the EPA dedicated to advancing environmental justice and civil rights. \n\nThis office was tapped to oversee the implementation and delivery of the $3 billion Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grant created by the Inflation Reduction Act. The Trump administration shut down this EPA arm in March 2025. \n\nThe moves fell in line with Trump’s executive orders and directives to ban or dismantle diversity, equity and inclusion programs across the federal government, placing staff on leave, terminating offices and targeting federal contractors and grantees. \n\nThe EPA said via email that it is investing in North Texas and noted its $500,000 grant to the city of Garland to assess and revitalize abandoned and derelict properties.\n\nCity of Garland officials say it applied for a competitive EPA assessment grant through a monthslong process that took about nine months from application to award, with work on the application beginning in late 2024 and the EPA announcing the $500,000 award on May 19, 2025. \n\nAyako Schuster, the director of the Economic Development Department in Garland, said the city had been notified of the award and is awaiting funding. \n\nSchuster said the grant is strictly for environmental assessment, focused on industrial areas and downtown but available citywide, including for private property owners who request it, to determine whether sites are clean and eligible for development. \n\nSchuster said using the EPA assessment funds helps identify environmental issues before redevelopment and reduces reliance on local taxpayer money for these studies.\n\nBut for communities such as West Dallas, Joppa in southern Dallas and Echo Heights in Fort Worth, advocates say hyperlocal air monitors not only supply data but also empower residents to understand and confront pollution threats affecting health outcomes such as asthma and cardiovascular disease.\n\nRoberts and other local leaders had hoped to use a roughly $500,000 EPA award to expand SharedAirDFW, a community-designed monitoring network, into more neighborhoods where traditional federal air monitors are sparse.\n\nThe group planned to install approximately nine new air monitors across Dallas-Fort Worth. \n\nOne air monitor was going to be placed in Echo Heights, a predominantly Black and Hispanic neighborhood in southeast Fort Worth. \n\nLetitia Wilbourn, a longtime Echo Heights resident and leader of the Echo Heights Stop Six Environmental Coalition, said her community has historically been forgotten and exposed to cancer-causing chemicals and pollutants emitted by the almost 200 industrial businesses in the area, including trucking centers and natural gas drilling sites.\n\nDuring what Wilbourn calls a “toxic tour,” she drove The News around her neighborhood to show the industrial plants and trucking companies. One of those companies is located right behind her house.\n\n“We are tired of being overlooked,” Wilbourn said. “No matter how much we complain, we always get asked, ‘Where’s the data?’ We had planned to use these monitors to obtain and present data to the city council.”\n\nDallas-Fort Worth is among the most ozone-polluted metro areas in the U.S., according to the American Lung Association. In 2025, the D-FW area ranked No. 10 out of 228 metropolitan areas for the most high-ozone days — a setback from previous rankings, The News reported. \n\n“We won’t be deterred by this,” Wilbourn said, “but it’s certainly set us back.” \n\nThe lawsuit argues that cutting the grant funds has left environmental advocates and local governments unable to carry out essential on-the-ground work. That includes installing monitors and engaging residents in pollution tracking. \n\nThese communities and organizations are seeking ongoing programs and grants to advocate for disadvantaged communities to have clean air, affordable energy and economic opportunity. Without a win in the courtroom, their only option to continue might be to wait for the next administration and see if it is more favorable to these policies. \n\nBut for some, like Wallace, who shut down Green Career Texas, this might not be an option in three years.","url":"https://www.dallasnews.com/news/environment/2026/02/03/environmental-justice-efforts-in-north-texas-hampered-by-trump-era-epa-rollbacks/","image":"https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/EOOUCDMDBZEXXORPZHGA4LCTD4.jpg?auth=c7f2f3f018f2f1b3614bb9e4dd71d71ba840e6985c64cac1e3b4dc5b7b539ee8&quality=80&width=1200&height=630&smart=true","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-03

did not have a Brat summer in 2024 as he was left floundering in an ’embarrassing’ interview with Charli XCX.\n\nThe Chains of Love singer was on his Smartless podcast to promote the Wuthering Heights movie, which she soundtracked.\n\nUnfortunately for all involved, including co-host Sean Hayes, the chat devolved into a rather awkward discussion about kids 20 minutes in.\n\nCharli was speaking about how she handles conflict compared to her friends, reflecting that this may stem from being an only child.\n\nJason wondered if that would mean she wants to ‘have more than one kid’ or one ‘who has the same experience as you?’\n\n‘I actually don’t really want to have kids,’ the 33-year-old replied, prompting surprise from the Zootropolis actor and his co-host Sean.\n\n Jason Bateman hosts

Baron/BEI/Shutterstock)\n\nSean asked ‘why’ before noting that it was ‘really none of his business’, adding that he and his partner do not have kids.\n\nCharli acknowledged she ‘might change her mind’ before explaining her reasoning, revealing she likes the thought of naming a child, as that sounds ‘so fun’.\n\n‘That is exactly a sign to me to why I should not have one,’ she continued. ‘The fact that that feels like the coolest part about it and like, maybe I’m not ready, you know?’\n\nIn an attempt to connect with Charli, Jason shared the story of his wife, Amanda Anka, who he said didn’t want kids before they met.\n\nThe pair now have two daughters, Francesca Nora Bateman and Maple Sylvie Bateman, born in 2009 and 2012, respectively.\n\nThis is where things turned awkward as he told Charli she ‘might find somebody’ who changes her mind.\n\n‘I’m married,’ Charli quipped, having tied the knot with The 1975’s George Daniel last year.\n\nJason admitted he needed to ‘pick up a newspaper’ with the singer graciously saying she knew where he was going with his story and had been excited to respond.\n\nTrying to recover, he said maybe her ‘next husband’ will be the one to change her mind, to which she laughed in agreement before it cut to an ad break.\n\nWhile Charli laughed off the uncomfortable moment, fans online have been less impressed with Jason’s ‘outdated’ and ‘sexist’ comment.\n\n He told her the right man would change her mind about kids (Picture: Unique Nicole/FilmMagic)\n\n Charli reminded Jason she is married to The 1975’s George Daniel (Picture:

alone telling her she’ll change her mind.\n\n‘I always forget certain celebrities I like are old and still think like this,’ quipped rachellacroixs.\n\nButurlosingit added: ‘This is such a bad interview overall, what do you mean Bateman didn’t even know what brat was… I’m so embarrassed for them.’\n\n‘Sometimes you have to laugh at sexism so you don’t cry man,’ said nosebleedportr8. ‘It always makes smart people look stupid to be sexist too, because if they did the bare minimum of background research by listening to brat they’d know she’s *already* thought this through.’\n\n Charli even had to tell him what Brat was (Picture: Houston Chronicle via Getty Imag)\n\n Fans criticised the podcast’s poor research as ‘disrespectful’ (Picture: Emma McIntyre/Getty Images for SiriusXM)\n\nCharli released the track I Think About It All The Time, ruminating on the possibility she will want kids after she has ‘run out of time’.\n\n‘I think about it all the time / That I might run out of time,’ she sings. ‘Cause maybe one day I might / If I don’t run out of time / Would it give my life a new purpose?’\n\nFans pointed out how ‘disrespectful’ it was that Charli ended up having to explain Brat to Jason, who they claimed had done ‘no research’.\n\nDuring the chat, she told him, ‘it was only a cultural phenomenon,’ when he had no idea Kamala Harris’ green-themed presidential campaign was a reference to her.\n\nAt the end of the episode, Will Arnett appeared, having missed out on the interview, praising Charli as an ‘impressive artist and person’.\n\nMetro has

was an underrated storyline of the 2024 election, one that’s increasingly starting to resurface now, as President Donald Trump goes on a foreign policy crusade, threatening to upend longstanding geopolitical norms between the United States and our allies (*cough, acquiring Greenland, cough*): Gen Z really doesn’t want to go to war.\nIn my work as a researcher, this is something I heard in focus groups and on campus quads at the time. Yes, economic issues mattered the most, but a surprising number volunteered that they were worried about the US being dragged into conflicts — and what it would mean for the generation that would be tasked with fighting them. \n“I think Trump ran a good campaign to young people on stopping war,” Nicholas, an 18-year-old from Arizona, told me in a December listening session. “That was one of the main kind of slogans, that he went off of as being pro-peace.”\nI’ve been thinking of these voters this week, as the president’s approval rating plummets with young Americans. Nicholas, for example, pointed out that the war in Ukraine still remained active. By the time I organized my next listening session in January, Trump had already ordered a dramatic raid in Venezuela, made noise about follow-up action elsewhere in Latin America, threatened fresh strikes in Iran to support protesters, and escalated his pressure campaign over Greenland.\nGeorge, a 19-year-old Republican from New York, said that while he has been optimistic about Trump’s foreign policy because he believes the United States should “make the world a safer place,” he’s skeptical of the administration’s recent suite of military operations and standoffs.\n“It feels like it’s very ‘make it up as you go,’” he said. “And then when it comes to Greenland, I feel like it’s sort of, ‘What are we doing here?’ It’s not being the good guys on the world stage. And why are you trying to mess things up?”\nGeorge is perhaps more hawkish than many young men voters right of center, who are increasingly wary of the need for US involvement abroad at all. Sixty-three percent of conservative young men under 30, 57 percent of MAGA Republican men under 30, and 53 percent of all men under 30 said “the US should be less actively involved in world affairs,” according to a YouGov/Young Men Research Project poll from November 2025.\nBut it’s not just young men. \n“The ‘no new wars’ thing is now the biggest joke of my life,” said Corinne, a 22-year-old woman from Ohio who voted for Trump. “It would be one thing if I felt like we were getting involved in something that mattered…but we’re inserting ourselves in conflict that we have no real reason to right now.”\nThe foreign policy age split\nThough Gen Z might not remember the forever wars like millennials do, but they’ve grown up watching foreign conflicts in real time: Ukraine and Russia, Israel and Gaza, and more. While relatively few have faced combat themselves, TikTok and Instagram afford a veil of proximity to these crises and their humanitarian toll. \nAcross the board, polling shows young Americans have less tolerance for foreign intervention than older generations. Just one in 10 Americans ages 18 to 34 years old said the US should take the leading role in world affairs, which is 10 percentage points lower than those ages 35 to 54 and 13 points lower than those 55 and older, according to a Gallup poll from March 2025.\nAnd a Pew Research Center study from December 2025 shows that only 39 percent of Americans under 30 believe it is extremely or very important for the United States to take an active role in world affairs. That’s a 5-point drop from respondents ages 30-49, a 20-point drop from those ages 50-64, and a whopping 34-point drop from those aged 65 and older. \nIt’s likely these gaps are playing at least some role in Trump’s collapse in polling among young voters barely more than a year after Gen Z shifted toward Republicans in 2024. A recent CNN poll found Trump’s approval rating on foreign affairs was 39 points below water with 18- to 34-year-olds. Sixty-one percent of Americans under 30 in a CBS/YouGov poll said the Trump administration is focusing “too much” on “international matters and events overseas,” 11 points higher than 30- to 44-year-olds, 9 points higher than those ages 45 to 64, and 12 points higher than those 65 and older. \nRaised on “America First”\nPart of Trump’s pitch to voters of all ages in 2024 was his promise to focus on Americans over foreign interests. Many Americans concluded that their country had more than enough problems at home to justify pulling back abroad, a view reinforced by popular voices on both the “America First” right — especially when it came to Ukraine — and anti-interventionist left — especially when it came to Israel’s war in Gaza. \nThe Trump campaign was well aware of these concerns: JD Vance, who prided himself on his connection with rising conservatives, mockingly warned voters under 30 that former Republican Rep. Liz Cheney would team up with Kamala Harris to launch a nuclear war and reassured a podcaster, “our interest very much is in not going to war with Iran.”\nBut this summer, after the United States struck Iranian nuclear sites, I started to hear unease with Trump’s policy abroad popping up again. When the US military captured Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro, these concerns were reignited, even as some had conflicted views on whether the move was justified or helpful.\nAs costs continue to rise at home and the national debt grows, and Trump dips his toes into foreign affairs and deploys US resources elsewhere, many young voters are starting to doubt that the “America First” president really has everyday Americans’ best interests in mind. \nCorinne, the 22-year-old Trump voter from Ohio, said she was hopeful going into his second term that Trump would pay attention to issues like lowering rent and upholding traditional values. \n“There were a lot of interesting things on the table, where I was like, ‘Okay, I can get behind that,’” she said. “And then all of those things, just like ‘poof,’ and then all of a sudden, all these new things came in.”\nOutside of wartime, voters have a reputation for not voting on foreign policy in comparison to domestic issues — a Pew poll in September 2024 found it ranked well behind economic issues in both parties, for example. But for many young Americans, foreign policy and domestic policy aren’t separate issues. They’re linked together by a president who they feel is focused on his own priorities and pet projects, instead of the American people’s.\nFor this generation of young adults trying to build their futures, college education can feel nearly impossible to afford, AI is reshaping the job market, homes are increasingly out of reach, and ICE agents are pouring into American communities. For them, it can feel like Trump is threatening to invade Greenland instead of working to bring down their bottom line or keeping American streets safe. \nAs Tim, a 24-year-old in Illinois, shared in January 2026 by text, he believes Trump is “using foreign policy for his own good and gain, whether to make him and his all[ies] and friends richer or to make himself look like the most powerful person in the world.”\nAccording to a recent New York Times/Siena poll, Trump’s under water in his approval rating with 18- to 29-year-old voters on a whole range of issues — from his handling of the Epstein files (80 percent of young respondents disapprove) to the cost of living (73 percent disapprove), Russia-Ukraine war (70 percent disapprove), immigration (73 percent disapprove), the Israeli-Palestinian conflict (66 percent disapprove), and more. He’s performing so poorly, in fact, that it can be hard to single out any one cause. But while Gen Z Americans may not vote on foreign policy in isolation in November, this administration’s foreign policy posture is surely part of the broader slate of issues they’re prioritizing ahead of November. Republicans should be very worried.","summary":"There was an underrated storyline of the 2024 election, one that’s increasingly starting to resurface now, as President Donald Trump goes on a foreign policy crusade, threatening to upend longstanding geopolitical norms between the United States and our allies (*cough, acquiring Greenland, cough*): Gen Z really doesn’t want to go to war.

Media elites suggested the Lemon arrest was an unprecedented descent into authoritarianism. But in March of 2024, Biden's FBI arrested journalist Steve Baker of The Blaze for being present with January 6 protesters.

He interviewed Planned Parenthood staffers who explained how they sold dead baby parts for profit. As usual, the standards are based on whether or not you're on \"the right side of history,\" and conservative journalists aren't considered journalists. Their activists are journalists, and our journalists are propagandists. \n\nAt least the Sunday shows appeared to be hedging on Lemon. CBS didn’t mention it, NBC touched on it in one question, and ABC’s George Stephanopoulos faced strong pushback from Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche. But on Friday night's \"Thunderdome\" (CNN NewsNight), host Abby Phillip incorrectly claimed that Lemon was not named in a part of the indictment where he was in fact included. She wound up being corrected by panelist and New York Post correspondent Lydia Moynihan. “The indictment obviously suggested that he posted himself at the main door, he prevented people from exiting.”\n\nSpeaking of CNN, their CEO Mark Thompson was confronted by leftist staffers at an internal town hall who \"questioned the behavior\" of conservative CNN contributor Scott Jennings, claiming he used inappropriate terms on television like....\"illegal aliens.\" One Democrat who's faced off with Jennings, Julie Roginsky, complained on Substack that he is “rude, dismissive, and antagonistic in ways that feel personal rather than substantive.” How would that make him stand out on CNN, considering how rude and antagonistic they are toward Republicans all the time? \n\nFinally, Trump fans eagerly turned out and loved the new Melania documentary – and the very liberal movie-critic mob couldn't stand it. Early projections are that it will make $8.1 million at the box office in its opening weekend, much more than the first estimates of $3-5 million. The Hollywood Reporter sounded crestfallen: \"No one saw that coming.\" They should have. \n\nWatch the podcast below. The audio is here.

This is actually true,” Stewart said, before revealing the contents of the email: “Make a true biographical experience with his stand-up being the capper. Somebody like Jon Stewart could host/narrate the biographical part.\"\n\nStewart, in mock outrage, joked: “Excuse me? I am offended. Somebody like Jon Stewart, or Jon Stewart? My point is, do I have the offer, or is this an audition?”\n\nThe TV star called the release of the Epstein files “Groundhog Day”, adding: “This is the day when Donald Trump sees Epstein’s shadow and we get six more weeks of not knowing who any of the co-conspirators are in this multinational sex trafficking case.”\n\nHe hit out at the “politically well-connected” for “skirting any form of legal accountability” after being named in the files, adding: “It seems pretty clear to me that there is a sanctuary city in this country. The real sanctuary city is where money and power protect you from the consequences of sex trafficking, or influence peddling, or taking half a billion dollars and giving away America’s AI infrastructure — not the small Midwestern city where trying to help a lady get up after she gets maced gets you shot in the back of the f***ing head.”\n\nStewart was referencing the death of Renee Nicole Good, who was killed during an altercation with an ICE agent in Minneapolis in January. An autopsy report commissioned by her family found that Good, 37, had suffered three clear gunshot wounds, one of which had been to her head.\n\nStewart previously addressed Trump’s appearance in the Epstein emails, claiming: “You know it’s real because his allies are working overtime to distract.”\n\nMany of the emails released in November 2025 mention Trump, who was friends with the disgraced financier decades ago. In one email, Epstein claimed the future US president “knew about the girls”.\n\nHowever, Trump, who at the time said he would sign a bill to release the files if passed, told reporters that he “knows nothing” about the emails.\n\nStewart said: “This Epstein thing is no Democrat hoax, and you know it’s real because Trump’s allies are working overtime to distract, or in the case of Fox News, not even a mention.\n\n“When the emails came out, Fox devoted most of their airtime to such urgent matters as: the socialist takeover of Seattle, the Treasury phasing out the penny, the Northern Lights, the growing popularity of Christian music, and, as always, ‘Kamala Harris goes crazy for carbs’.”\n\nHe added the president is “flailing” when asked about the emails, stating: “If he had nothing to hide, he could have declassified and released these files at any time, and how do I know this? He said so.”\n\nStewart then presented a clip of Trump on Fox News in September 2022, saying: “If you’re the president of the United States, you can declassify just by saying, ‘It's declassified.’”\n\nThe host added that Trump’s inclusion in the Epstein emails is not evidence of guilt.","summary":"‘This is actually true,’ the ‘Daily Show host said of surprise inclusion in newly released documents","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/epstein-files-jon-stewart-daily-show-b2912771.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2026/02/03/8/22/Screenshot-2026-02-03-at-08-17-49.png?crop=689.3,459.5,x48.7,y87.8&trim=87,0,117,48&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-03 08:52:25","author":"Jacob Stolworthy","authors":["Jacob Stolworthy"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.266},{"id":398852126,"title":"‘Way too far’: Latino Trump voters shocked by Minneapolis crackdown | Kuwait Times Newspaper","text":"MINNEAPOLIS: Like many Latinos who voted in the 2024 US presidential election, Edgar Hernandez cast his ballot for Donald Trump.

I went there to be a journalist. I went there to chronicle and document and record what was happening ... I do think that there is a difference between a protester and a journalist.\" The appearance arrived less than a week after the former CNN anchor — now an independent journalist who hosts a YouTube show — was arrested by federal agents in Los Angeles following his coverage of an anti-ICE protest at a Minnesota church earlier this month. Lemon, 59, was released without bond Friday and is expected to plead not guilty, according to his attorneys. On Monday's show, Kimmel began the conversation by asking Lemon how he was feeling: \"I don't know — that's an honest answer,\" Lemon said. \"I'm OK. I'm not going to let them steal my joy, but this is very serious. These are federal criminal charges.\" Lemon was arrested — along with three others in attendance at the protest — at the direction of Atty. Gen. Pam Bondi, who said on X that it was in connection to what she described as a \"coordinated attack\" on the church, located in St. Paul. Lemon is charged with conspiracy to deprive the church congregants of their rights and interfering by force with someone's First Amendment rights. Lemon has denied participating in the protest at the church — assembled to decry that an Immigration and Customs Enforcement field officer apparently serves as a pastor there — saying he was present in a journalistic capacity. Playfully acknowledging that he hasn't been a favorite of President Trump's since his time on CNN, Lemon said he hadn't been concerned about his possible arrest — even with a re-post by Trump calling for it — until it gained steam by members of Trump's cabinet, including Bondi and Todd Blanche, the U.S. deputy attorney general. Lemon said that after retaining a lawyer and volunteering to turn himself in to handle the matter without fanfare, he \"never heard back from them.\" \"That is customary in a situation like this, that someone would be allowed to turn themselves in,\" Lemon said. \"People who are who are accused of much worse things than I am accused of doing, they are allowed the courtesy. I mean, Donald Trump was allowed the courtesy to turn himself in ...\" Lemon went on to detail the moments leading up to his arrest Thursday, which came after a night of covering a Grammys event for the Black Music Collective and attending a post-party celebration. \"I got back to the hotel, I walked in with my swag bag from the thing ... and I pressed the elevator button and all of a sudden I feel myself being jostled, people trying to grab me and put me in handcuffs,\" he recounted. \"And I said, 'What are you doing here?' And they said, 'We came to arrest you.' I said, 'Who are you?' Then finally they identified themselves. And I said, 'If you are who you are, then where's the warrant?' And they didn't have a warrant, so they had to wait for the someone from outside, an FBI guy, to come in to show me a warrant on a cell phone ... They took me outside FBI guys were out there. It had to be maybe a dozen people, which is a waste, Jimmy, of resources ... They want to embarrass you. They want to intimidate you. They want to instill fear.\" He said he hadn't realized how much attention his arrest had generated until he saw CNN broadcasting the story on a TV monitor where he was being held. \"I could see 'Former CNN anchor Don Lemon arrested in Los Angeles,'\" he said. \"I said to the guy, 'Is that happening a lot?' He goes, 'You've been on all morning, yeah. And he says, 'This is a big deal.'\" During the conversation, Kimmel criticized what he felt was a lack of attention to the recent search by FBI agents of the home of a Washington Post reporter who covers the federal government. Lemon, who parted ways with CNN in 2023, attributed it to a fear among the leaders of corporate press enterprises. \"Corporate media has been neutered right now. They are afraid, and that's the reason I'm so happy with what I do, because I'm closer to the ground,\" he said. \"This is not time for folly. It's not time for false equivalence, and putting people on television and on news programs, giving them a platform, who come on just to lie. .... Some things are objectively bad and I think its important in this time to point that out.\" Lemon hitting the late-night circuit intensifies its spotlight as a free-speech battleground. The Trump era has prompted more pointed and passionate takes from most of the major hosts that, in turn, have captured the attention and ire of the president, who has provoked threats against them and their broadcasters. Last year, CBS announced it was canceling “The Late Show” after a three-decade run — a decision the company attributed to financial reasons and not, as many have speculated, because of host Stephen Colbert’s criticism of a settlement between the Trump administration and Paramount, the parent company of CBS, over a 2024 “60 Minutes” interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris. More recently, Kimmel faced a brief suspension last fall over comments regarding the killing of right-wing activist and influencer Charlie Kirk (ABC ultimately reinstated Kimmel following public backlash.) In fact, Lemon referenced that situation prior to his arrest, when a judge dismissed prosectors' initial charging effort: \"This is not a victory lap for me because it's not over. They're gonna try again,\" Lemon told his followers on his YouTube show after the judge's ruling. \"Go ahead, make me into the new Jimmy Kimmel, if you want.\" Last Friday, addressing a crowd outside the courthouse upon his release, Lemon said, \"There is no more important time than right now, this very moment, for a free and independent media that shines a light on the truth and holds those in power accountable. I will not stop now, I will not stop ever.\"","summary":"The former CNN anchor spoke in-depth about his arrest last week with the late-night host on Monday, saying that the charges against him were 'very serious.'","url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2026-02-02/don-lemon-jimmy-kimmel-live-post-arrest-appearance","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/954b438/2147483647/strip/false/crop/382x60+0+0/resize/382x60!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2F5f%2F46c2d05b430cbc6e775301df1062%2Flogo-full-black.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-03 06:12:23","author":"Yvonne Villarreal","authors":["Yvonne Villarreal"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.447},{"id":398821522,"title":"'Way too far': Latino Trump voters shocked by Minneapolis crackdown","text":"Like many Latinos who voted in the 2024 US presidential election, Edgar Hernandez cast his ballot for Donald Trump.

The evening was defined by a coordinated \"ICE OUT\" campaign and a historic win for Bad Bunny, marking one of the most politicised broadcasts in the Recording Academy’s history. Grammys 2026: Billie Eilish, Bad Bunny and Other Celebs Voice Opposition to Donald Trump’s Immigration Policies (Watch Videos) Stars Wear ‘ICE OUT’ Pins at 2026 Grammys The tone for the evening was set on the red carpet, where stars including Justin Bieber, Olivia Rodrigo, Joni Mitchell, and Carole King were seen wearing black-and-white pins reading “ICE OUT.” The grassroots effort, organized by Working Families Power, was a direct response to the recent killings of protesters Renee Good and Alex Pretti by federal agents in Minneapolis. Nelini Stamp, director of strategy for Working Families Power, noted that the campaign provided various pin sizes to accommodate the artists' high-fashion wardrobes. “We want to be respectful,” Stamp said in an interview on Monday. “Folks choose their outfits sometimes months before.” Bad Bunny and Billie Eilish Condemn Immigration Policies The \"ICE OUT\" message moved from the lapels of guests to the center stage during the televised broadcast. While accepting the award for Best Música Urbana Album, Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny delivered a pointed message to the White House. “Before I say thanks to God, I’m going to say ‘ICE out,’” he told the audience. “We’re not savage, we’re not animals, we’re not aliens. We are humans, and we are Americans.” Grammys 2026: Lady Gaga Steals the Spotlight at Grammys Red Carpet in Raven-Black Look As She Earns Seven Major Nominations. Later in the evening, Billie Eilish, who won Song of the Year for a record-setting third time, echoed the sentiment. “No one is illegal on stolen land,” Eilish said, followed by a blunt criticism of Immigration and Customs Enforcement that was censored by the network. Other winners, such as Best New Artist Olivia Dean, took a more personal approach. “I’m a granddaughter of an immigrant,” Dean said. “I’m a product of bravery, and I believe those people deserve to be celebrated.” Trump Threatens Legal Action Against Trevor Noah While the artists focused on immigration, host Trevor Noah directed his humor toward President Trump, who is currently in office. In his sixth and final time hosting the event, Noah joked that the Song of the Year is a trophy \"every artist wants almost as much as Trump wants Greenland.\" The President responded late Sunday night on Truth Social, calling the ceremony “the WORST, virtually unwatchable!” and threatening to sue Noah, writing, “Get ready Noah, I’m going to have some fun with you!” The friction comes at a sensitive time for CBS. Last year, parent company Paramount paid UAD 16 million to settle a lawsuit with Trump regarding the editing of a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris. The network also recently cancelled The Late Show With Stephen Colbert, citing financial reasons. Historic Night for Spanish-Language Music Despite the controversy, the night saw significant milestones for Latin music. Bad Bunny’s Debi Tirar Mas Fotos became the first all-Spanish album to win Album of the Year in the Grammys' 68-year history. The achievement comes just days before Bad Bunny is scheduled to give the first-ever all-Spanish halftime performance at the Super Bowl, a booking Trump previously criticised as a “terrible choice.” Grammys 2026: Sabrina Carpenter Turns Heads at Grammys Red Carpet in Valentino Ruffled Gown As She Earns Major Nominations. A Shift in Ceremony Dynamics Industry analysts noted that while the Recording Academy provided a standard entertainment format featuring performances by Justin Bieber and Lola Young, the political weight of the night was driven entirely by the participants. Larry Miller, executive director of the Sony Audio Institute at NYU, suggested the Academy was right to let the artist’s lead. “Great artists speak their truth... They are beholden to no company and certainly not to CBS,” Miller said. “It wasn’t the Recording Academy’s job to take a position. Representatives for the Recording Academy and CBS have not yet issued formal comments regarding the evening's events or the President's social media posts.","summary":"The 68th Grammy Awards took a political turn as Bad Bunny and Billie Eilish led an &quot;ICE OUT&quot; protest against federal immigration policies.

But if I had never heard of Newsmax or the ban was on another TV network, the answer would be the same. When America gets to the point that a government official is trying to use his/her governmental authority to shut down a free press, the red flags should go up.\n\nBluntly put, Borough President Brad Hoylman-Sigal is standing up for fascism. Fascism is defined, per the Merriam-Webster dictionary, as a philosophy “associated with a centralized autocratic government headed by a dictatorial leader, and that is characterized by severe economic and social regimentation and by forcible suppression of opposition.”\n\nAnd what the Manhattan Borough president (a Democrat, but of course) is demanding is exactly the “forcible suppression of opposition.” With Hoylman-Sigal demanding that Mayor Mamdani play the role of the dictator.\n\nNote well, if there is a felt need for TV in NYC taxi cabs, Hoylman-Sigal is not proposing a multitude of channels out there to fill the screen. The fact is that in today’s world, home televisions can and do offer a variety of news channels that include not just Newsmax but CNN, Fox, News Nation, and MSNBC, the latter rebranding itself as MS Now. And that’s before you get to local newscasts in whatever area the cab operates. It’s up to the viewer as to which one they choose to watch.\n\nChoice in television channels. What an amazing, revolutionary concept. Who knew?\n\nThe real problem here is that Hoylman-Sigal’s fascist push to ban free speech and intellectual diversity in New York City taxi cab televisions is, in reality, exactly the underlying philosophy of the modern Democrat Party and the American Left.\n\nEverything — everything — is the Left’s way or the highway.\n\nScroll through the Internet and headlines reporting some Democrat somewhere trying to silence the GOP opposition litter the screen.\n\n“House Republicans slam WA Democrats for ‘censoring’ debate on parental rights law.”“College Democrats cancel debate with College Republicans.”“Democrats in Colorado House take extraordinary step of limiting debate on gun measures to halt GOP filibuster,” with the subtitle, “It appears to be the first time debate in the House has been limited in at least a decade.”“Opinion: The goal of liberal America is to intimidate conservatives into silence.”\n\nThis last opinion piece, penned by CNN’s conservative contributor Scott Jennings, notes:\n\nAmerica’s left-wing has taken a dark and dangerous turn, now openly expressing a desire for its political opposition to be delegitimized, criminalized, intimidated and ultimately banished.This attitude has been boiling since Donald Trump became president. He’s too dangerous to be allowed to speak, they said, as the likes of Sen. Kamala Harris called on Twitter to suspend his account.\n\nOn and on goes the Left’s instinctive move to silence views on whatever they don’t like and want silenced.\n\nAnd now, as noted above: “Manhattan Borough President Brad Hoylman-Sigal is now demanding that New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani ban Newsmax TV from the TV screens in New York City taxi cabs.”\n\nAll of which is to say, as Manhattan Borough President Brad Hoylman-Sigal’s push to demand Newsmax TV be removed from New York City cabs vividly illustrates, the Left is all about fascism. Outright fascism.\n\nWhich is, without doubt, decidedly un-American.\n\nREAD MORE from Jeffrey Lord:\n\nPhiladelphia DA Krasner’s Wreckless ‘Nazi’ Rhetoric\n\nGovernor Walz: Getting Minnesotans Killed\n\nTrump, Greenland, and the US","summary":"Amazing.

So is Rep. Al Green, who for decades represented a district nearby but now finds himself living in a newly drawn 18th. \n\nThe back-to-back elections are among the head-spinning electoral oddities that voters in heavily Democratic Houston have experienced in recent months. \n\nFor nearly a year, the district's residents had no representative in the U.S. House after their member died. And before voters could select a successor, the Texas Legislature redrew the state's congressional maps to help Republicans' midterm election prospects, further complicating things and raising concerns about disenfranchising voters in the predominantly Black and Hispanic district. \n\n\"It has been exhausting. Voters are confused. Voters are tired,\" said Shamier Bouie, chairwoman of Black American Democrats of Houston. \"Even people who are pretty politically savvy, it's still confusing for them.\"\n\nTaken together, voters' questions surrounding this pileup of elections and the new House boundaries mark an unwieldy start to the 2026 midterm campaigns for control of Congress. Texas' March 3 primary will be the first using a new U.S. House map drawn at the start of a national redistricting battle spurred by President Donald Trump. \n\nShampu Sibley, who voted Wednesday at Wheeler Avenue Baptist Church, decried the mid-decade redistricting as \"a political move\" by the GOP-led Texas Legislature.\n\nThe 62-year-old novelist, who lives within the current boundaries of the 18th District, was uncertain if his home will still be in the 18th on the new map.\n\n\"We're not going to say they want to steal elections, but they make it very hard for the Black and brown communities to vote,\" he said.\n\nA long-vacant seat\n\nThe current 18th District is a Democratic stronghold in a Republican state. In 2024, Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris won about 69% of the vote. So did the late Rep. Sylvester Turner, who died in March 2025. \n\nAfter Turner's death, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott set an all-party primary to fill the seat for eight months later, suggesting it would take Harris County elections officials months to prepare for the vote. Democrats accused Abbott of delaying the vote to help Republican House leader Mike Johnson pass legislation with a thin GOP majority.\n\nWhen none of the 16 candidates won a majority in November, the race advanced to Saturday's runoff, which Menefee won. \n\nEdwards and Menefee have been vocal in their criticism of leaving the 18th District, including large tracts of the nation's fourth-largest city, without representation.\n\nIn particular, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have been active for months in Houston, which has received less publicity than cities such as Chicago, Los Angeles and now Minneapolis, in part because of the empty seat, Edwards said.\n\n\"If there was advocacy, if there was use of a bully pulpit to get people together and really walk in unison around an issue of justice, this seat was it,\" she said. \"To have it silenced is not a coincidence.\" \n\nNew maps to help Trump\n\nMeanwhile, the GOP-controlled Texas Legislature in August adopted redrawn congressional maps at the direction of Trump, who has warned Republicans that if they lose control of the U.S. House in November he will be impeached again. Some other states, including heavily Democratic California, later drew their own new maps. \n\nThe 18th District, which is centered around Houston and entirely in Harris County in southeast Texas, was divided among nearly a half-dozen districts. The largest share of the population in the current 18th district will become part of a different district. \n\nThat means Menefee and Edwards are turning around and running in a district that includes some new territory. They also will face yet another candidate in Green, an 11-term Democratic congressman whose Houston home was included in a new, Republican-leaning district, prompting him last year to announce plans to run in the the Democratic-leaning new 18th District. \n\nIt has set up a generational battle between Green, who is 78, and Menefee, the 37-year-old former county attorney, and Edwards, a 44-year-old former Houston city councilwoman. \n\nOverlapping elections add to confusion \n\nMenefee and Edwards said they had spent as much time answering voter questions in an effort to help voters keep the timing straight as they had talking about their policy positions.\n\n\"There have been times where I've shown up at community centers and somebody will say, 'Why haven't you come to my neighborhood or my church? And I'll say, 'Where do you go to church at?'\" Menefee said, only to learn the person lives in the new 18th District. \"That has happened to me at least a dozen times.\"\n\nLast week, Houston lawyer and Democratic activist Brandon Cofield met a man who had visited his local polling place hoping to vote in the March 3 primary, thinking the early voting period had begun, only to be turned away. \n\nBecause Abbott scheduled the vacancy elections so late in 2025 and 2026, they ended up colliding with the start of the 2026 midterm elections, for the next term that will start in 2027.\n\nNot only were voters seeing campaign signs for the March 3 primary before the Saturday runoff, Harris County began sending out mail-in ballots for the new district primary two weeks before the runoff was finished. \n\n\"You literally had people who could vote in two different elections at the same time,\" Edwards said. \"These elections aren't just back to back. They overlap.\" \n\nThat meant that even as Edwards was urging voters to get out for Saturday's election, her team had to be looking ahead to the March 3 primary to meet filing deadlines in the new district. \n\nSome voters have grown dispirited\n\nMenefee said he's been trying to encourage people to stay engaged. \n\nIt has \"definitely made people feel like they can be a pawn in a game,\" he said. \"I think it has demoralized some people.\"\n\nTobin Hellums, a 57-year-old Houston entrepreneur, said he was confused because his normal early-voting location was different for the runoff. Harris County elections officials offered fewer early-voting stations because the ballot included only one race. \n\n\"The overall process was completely confusing,\" Hellums said.\n\nNatural forces have also contributed.\n\nThe Sunday before the runoff, Bouie's group had planned to blitz 10 of Houston's best-known Black churches to run through details of the coming election sequence for parishioners. With multiple services that day, she was looking at reaching thousands of voters in the district.\n\nThen a winter storm hit, closing the churches. Early voting was extended by two days to make up for the weather-related shutdown of polling places. But that also forced early run-off voting to overlap more with primary mail-in voting. \n\nMore election drama may lie ahead. The March 3 Democratic primary ballot will have four names: Menefee, Edwards, Green and Gretchen Brown, a veteran Defense Department senior staffer. If no candidate receives a majority of the vote, the race will move to a May runoff election. \n\n\"It feels like it's going to go on forever,\" Bouie said. \n\nBeaumont reported from Des Moines, Iowa.","url":"https://nationalnewswatch.com/2026/02/03/3-elections-in-4-months-and-new-us-house-map-lead-to-confusion-and-voter-fatigue-in-texas-district","image":"https://assets-nnw.nationalnewswatch.com/articles/_1200x630_crop_center-center_82_none/fd69069fb914a1203eb270053babd814be1729ebeff601eff6e83e4dcd5a65aa.jpg?mtime=1770127203","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-03 00:00:00","author":"President Donald Trump","authors":["President Donald Trump"],"language":"en","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.105},{"id":399038976,"title":"Judge rules against U.S. plan to strip 350,000 Haitians of legal status, notes ’racial animus’ of Noem, Trump","text":"A federal judge late Monday blocked the end of protections that have allowed roughly 350,000 Haitians to live in the U.S., dealing President Donald Trump's immigration agenda another legal, though perhaps temporary, setback.\n\nU.S. District Judge Ana Reyes in Washington granted a request to pause the termination of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Haitians while a lawsuit challenging it proceeds. The termination, which was set for Tuesday, shall be null, void, and of no legal effect, she wrote.\n\nReyes said in an 83-page opinion that plaintiffs were likely to prevail on the merits of the case, and that she found it substantially likely that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem preordained her termination decision and was motivated, at least in part, by racial animus.\n\nWhile the ruling grants temporary relief to Haitians, the next legal steps were unclear.\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security (DHS) spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin denounced the ruling as lawless activism.\n\nHaiti's TPS was granted following an earthquake that took place over 15 years ago, she said. It was never intended to be a de facto amnesty program, yet that's how previous administrations have used it for decades.\n\nHaiti not safe, plaintiffs argue\n\nThe judge, an appointee of former president Joe Biden, said Noem had significant discretion to enact policy as DHS secretary but did not have unbounded discretion and was required to consult with other agencies on conditions in Haiti.\n\nSecretary Noem is the decision-maker, wrote Reyes. But the Secretary cannot just throw verifiably inapposite or false assertion after inapposite or false assertion — no matter how inflammatory — against the wall and hope that something sticks.\n\nWho can protect Haiti? Country is beset by gangs (new window)\n\nGangs have 'near-total control' in Haiti, UN warns (new window)\n\nIn one example, Noem raised the issued of Haitian gang members who had entered the country, but Reyes noted that the government provided no evidence that had occurred with TPS holders, who were previously vetted.\n\nTemporary Protected Status can be granted by the homeland security secretary if conditions in home countries are deemed unsafe for return due to a natural disaster, political instability or other dangers. While it grants TPS holders the right to live and work in the U.S., it does not provide a legal pathway to citizenship.\n\nHaiti's TPS status was initially activated in 2010 after a catastrophic earthquake and has been extended multiple times. The country is racked by gang violence that has displaced hundreds of thousands of people, and plans to hold elections this year appear to be in jeopardy.\n\nIf the termination stands, people will almost certainly die, attorneys for Haitian TPS holders wrote in a court filing in December. Some will likely be killed, others will likely die from disease, and yet others will likely starve to death.\n\nWill Trump stop Haiti’s World Cup party before it even starts?\n\nDecember 5, 2025|Duration7:56Haiti has qualified for the 2026 World Cup for the first time in 50 years, but a travel ban and immigration raids will keep many fans away from U.S. matches. For The National, CBC’s Eli Glasner talks to Haitians about the meaning of this moment and explains why some are calling out FIFA for hypocrisy.\n\nA government notice in November announcing the termination of TPS for Haitians said there had been some positive developments in Haiti, including authorization of a new, multinational force to combat gangs.\n\nThe judge said that in supporting that position, the government had cherry-picked statements made by UN Secretary General António Guterres, and she also took note of a statement in October by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio indicating that Haiti is confronted by immediate security challenges.\n\nThe court said that Noem, in making her determination did not consult with Rubio, the U.S. ambassador to Haiti or the U.S. Embassy there.\n\nAnalysisHow Trump’s immigration crackdown is starting to hurt him politically (new window)\n\nWhat is ICE and how has it changed during Trump's 2nd term? (new window)\n\nThe ruling also took exception to Noem's own words three days after announcing an end to Haitian protections, calling for a travel ban from Haiti and every damn country that has been flooding our nation with killers, leeches, and entitlement junkies.\n\nReyes took pains to highlight that the five Haitians suing in the case at hand were not killers, leeches or entitlement junkies, but a neuroscientist, a software engineer, a registered nurse, a laboratory assistant and a college student.\n\nReprieve welcomed in Ohio city\n\nWhile campaigning for president in 2024, Trump denigrated the community of about 15,000 Haitians in Springfield, Ohio, including in his lone debate with Democrat Kamala Harris a claim that some of the immgirants were eating neighbourhood pets in the mostly white, working-class city of about 59,000 people.\n\nReyes took note of those comments, along with reports that Trump in his first term referred to Haiti as among a number of shithole countries.\n\nIn the weeks after his comments, schools, government buildings and the homes of elected officials in the city received bomb threats.\n\nEarlier Monday, two dozen faith leaders and hundreds of congregants in Springfield sang and prayed together in support of Haitian migrants who feared their protected status could end this week.\n\nLynn Tramonte, executive director of the Ohio Immigrant Alliance, said the court's 11th-hour reprieve is, of course, welcome. But people can't live their lives like this, pegging their families' futures to a court case.\n\nThe Trump administration has aggressively sought to remove temporary protections, making more people eligible for deportation. The moves are part of the administration's wider, mass deportation effort.\n\nIn addition to the migrants from Haiti, Noem has terminated protections for about 600,000 Venezuelans, 60,000 people from Honduras, Nicaragua and Nepal, more than 160,000 Ukrainians and thousands of people from Afghanistan and Cameroon. Several of those determinations have been challenged in the courts.\n\nThe Associated Press with files from CBC News","url":"https://ici.radio-canada.ca/rci/en/news/2225371/judge-rules-against-u-s-plan-to-strip-350-000-haitians-of-legal-status-notes-racial-animus-of-noem-trump","image":"https://images.radio-canada.ca/q_auto,w_635/v1/ici-info/16x9/kristi-noem-minneapolis.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-03 00:00:00","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.422},{"id":398768228,"title":"Winning in Trump’s backyard and raking in money: Democrats begin 2026 with warning to Republicans","text":"A shock election victory for Democrats in deep-red Texas on Saturday is giving the opposition party a jolt of momentum to begin 2026 — a year that will decide the fate of Donald Trump’s twin congressional majorities, and possibly his presidency.\n\nDemocrats elsewhere are seeing other signs, too, that the various dynamics that kept voters at home or willing to consider voting for Trump in 2024 are shifting. Despite being shy of the majority, members in both chambers are brimming with optimism and are beginning to talk openly about the possibility of pulling off a clean sweep of the GOP in November.\n\nSaturday’s runoff election in the Fort Worth area put a northern Texas district that voted for Donald Trump by 17 points in 2024 into the hands (briefly) of a Democrat, Taylor Rehmet, who supports statewide rent stabilization, vows to halt the sale of public lands, and end charter school voucher programs. It’s a potential sign not only of the appeal of a message akin to Zohran Mamdani’s in what is thought of as a much more conservative area, but also the rejuvenation of the Democratic brand in the wake of Kamala Harris and Joe Biden’s campaign and administration.\n\nRehmet, who credited “everyday working people” in his victory speech, took money from the DNC during his election bid and was still outspent by his conservative opponent. His campaign, the Texas Tribune reported, began in part after Rehmet was introduced to a state representative who later became one of his top Latino backers at a fundraiser for the Harris campaign.\n\nThe lesson here is not that Texas has suddenly jolted blue, or that Sen. John Cornyn’s seat will change hands next year. The Texas Senate race remains favorable ground for Republicans, not least given that an ugly dispute between top Democrats vying for the seat emerged on Monday, endangering party unity and risking hurt feelings among the eventual loser’s camp. But evidence is growing to support the idea that Democrats have recaptured the enthusiasm and anger against the status quo one year into Trump’s second term, following a series of victories for the party in hotly contested statewide races.\n\nThat enthusiasm can be measured in more than just polling. It can also be measured in dollars, where Republicans are seeing their foes raise alarming sums in key races and putting their candidates at an early advantage. That reality is evident in Ohio, where Sherrod Brown is running laps around incumbent Republican Sen. Jon Husted in fundraising totals as he seeks his old job; Brown was a victim of the GOP-led wipeout in 2024. Sen. Jon Ossoff has a staggering fundraising lead of roughly $9m over any of his Republican competitors, according to Roll Call. \n\nAnd in Maine, both of Susan Collins’s would-be challengers outraised her in the last quarter of 2024, though the longtime incumbent retains a cash-on-hand advantage. The real success story in the race is Graham Platner, who is outraising both the sitting senator and sitting governor, Janet Mills, as he seeks the Democratic nomination. In Alaska, former Rep. Mary Peltola said she outraised incumbent GOP Sen. Dan Sullivan’s Q4 fundraising total in a single 24-hour period after launching her bid for Senate.\n\nIn short: Democrats are in the money. And the party’s leadership is even recovering from some of the malaise it suffered under through 2025, when leaders like Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries were faulted by some members for insufficient resistance to the Trump administration and Elon Musk’s DOGE initiative.\n\nJeffries was positively glowing on Monday as he spoke to reporters about the five congressional seats changed by Texas Republicans in a controversial mid-decade redistricting project aimed at giving the GOP more seats in the House: \"The Republicans done effed up in Texas and they know it.” He added that he saw a path for Democrats to win all five of the newly-drawn seats.\n\nHe added that Rehmet’s victory was “a shellacking for Republicans in Texas” over the weekend.\n\nDemocrats are clearly entering the 2026 primary season with optimism and the wind at the party’s back. In Washington, Trump’s mass deportation chaos is eroding support for Republicans on one of their strongest issues, while the party offers little in the way of a unified response on the issue of affordability.\n\nAnd last week, a Florida Republican congressman announced his impending retirement. It’s a reminder that, as troubling as the map looks for Republicans now, it could look a whole lot worse if more key GOP incumbents tire of abuse from the White House and the president.\n\n“We have a clear and strong path to winning back the Senate. A year ago, no one thought that,” the Democratic senate leader told Politico last month in an interview. Since January of 2025, a GOP incumbent in North Carolina, Thom Tillis, had a public break-up with Trump over the president’s legislative agenda and announced his plans to retire. Democrats are now favored to win his seat.\n\nHe added: “Our north star is winning the Senate. That’s what motivates what we do in each thing.”","summary":"Another win for Democrats in Trump territory comes as the party is building a number of powerful campaign war chests, writes John Bowden","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/texas-democrats-fundraising-republicans-midterms-b2912617.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2026/02/02/0/39/Election-2026-Texas-Legislature-doqdufvx.jpeg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/di2odxdc-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2026-02-02 23:55:11","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.114}]}
