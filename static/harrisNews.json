The number is often used to describe California’s partisan shares. Voter registration tells a different story: Democrats at over 44% and Republicans at 25%. Nearly 23% of voters have no party preference.\n\nRepublicans claimed that because they only have 9 seats (17%), our current maps are gerrymandered and Republicans are underrepresented. Really? Every Republican Congress member voted yes on the bill that would cut the funding for food stamps and Medicaid. Was that what people in their districts wanted? If not, people are not well represented by those members. If voters dislike their representatives’ job, they should elect someone else regardless of their party affiliation.\n\nElected officials should listen to their people, and voters should cast their votes according to how their representatives are working for them. That is democracy, isn’t it?\n\nKyoko Takayama\n\nCalifornians vote for\ndisenfranchisement\n\nCongratulations, California. With the passage of Proposition 50, we are now officially a one-party state.\n\nThe proponents of Proposition 50 called it an effort to save democracy. In fact, it does just the opposite. Now, millions of Californians will be disenfranchised. Their voices, opinions and thoughts will become irrelevant or no longer heard. Disenfranchisement is the cornerstone of the disintegration of democracy. Disenfranchisement causes people to “check out” and no longer participate in our democratic system of government.\n\nSadly, neither one of the political parties seems to give a damn about the people they allegedly represent. Their only motivation is power and money.\n\nState GOP must change\nafter poor showing\n\nCalifornia Republican Party Chairwoman Corrin Rankin must resign. Millions of Californians are being silenced as rural communities are gerrymandered into deep blue districts. We the people once drew our own maps — now politicians do.\n\nThe GOP’s collapse on Proposition 50 proves how out of touch they’ve become. If you noticed the “No on Prop. 50” ads vanished near the end, you’re not crazy. They quit. The state party refused to energize the MAGA base or let President Trump get involved, dooming the campaign. For years, consultants have been paid to fail while grassroots conservatives carried the fight alone. Enough is enough.\n\nWe need a movement that fights for the people, not for donor contracts. Until real leadership steps up, not one more dollar should go to the state party. Don’t reward betrayal. Demand accountability and reform from within.\n\nJack Belgarde\n\n‘Mallard Fillmore’ is\nstill a comic, after all\n\nEver since the “Mallard Fillmore” comic strip appeared in this newspaper, there have been liberal opinion page writers insisting that it be removed. There has been a marked increase in that sentiment lately.\n\nI have been a subscriber to this newspaper for 50 years. Since approximately 1970, and until now, the “Doonesbury” comic strip in this newspaper and more than 1,400 newspapers worldwide has been lambasting conservatives with free rein and glee.\n\nIt won a Pulitzer Prize in 1975.\n\nIn fact, Doonesbury has been in rerun since 2014 every day except Sunday, but is still a staple for this newspaper’s comics page. During all that time, I have yet to see anyone ask for its removal. So we should ask ourselves who is really for free speech and who isn’t?\n\nAnd shouldn’t we remember that it’s a “comics” page?\n\nSteve Mahler\n\nCongress should lose\npay during shutdown\n\nCongress and only Congress can put an end to the nationwide shutdown. Some government employees are working (with a promise of back pay); some have been terminated; some are forced to work without pay. Obviously, this is not right, moral, fiscally responsible or in the best interests of our country.\n\nIronically, the legislators who can end this are not financially impacted; they are getting their full pay. Doesn’t it make sense to stop their salaries first? They aren’t doing their jobs — ending the shutdown. And the House of Representatives hasn’t even been in session for six weeks. That shows how much interest they have in trying to rectify this mess.\n\nCongress should be the first ones to be impacted by their inability to do their jobs. Where is a national referendum when we need it?\n\nWorld should unite\nover crisis in Sudan\n\nThe world is witnessing one of the most devastating humanitarian catastrophes in Sudan, yet global action remains far too limited. Credible reports indicate that the United Arab Emirates has provided support to the Rapid Support Forces, a group widely accused of atrocities against civilians. This support is believed to be exacerbating the conflict and deepening the suffering of millions of people.\n\nWe cannot remain silent while civilians endure mass violence, starvation and displacement. The United States and the international community must enforce an immediate end to all foreign assistance that enables armed actors responsible for human rights abuses in Sudan. Equally important, we must expand humanitarian access and pursue accountability for those committing crimes against innocent people.\n\nAs concerned citizens, we have a role, too. If foreign support for these forces continues, many people intend to respond peacefully by boycotting UAE-linked companies, including Emirates Airlines and UAE-owned sports organizations.","summary":"Also: Vote for disenfranchisement &#124; GOP reform &#124; Still a comic &#124; Congress pay &#124; Sudan crisis.

But has he met his match in New York's incoming mayor Zohran Mamdani?The mouthwatering showdown between the Republican and the young Democratic socialist could define the next phase of Trump's presidency.Trump has appeared to relish having Mamdani as a foil, branding him a communist, mocking the name of the first Muslim and South Asian to lead America's largest city, and threatening to cut federal funding for New York City.But his rival has shown he can play Trump at his own game.It's rare for former reality TV star Trump to see himself upstaged, but 34-year-old Mamdani managed it at his victory rally on Tuesday night.\"Donald Trump, since I know you're watching, I have four words for you -- turn the volume up!\" he said to huge cheers.White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed to reporters traveling with Trump on Air Force One the next day that the president had indeed watched Mamdani speak.Go through all of usTrump and Mamdani are, at least partly, enemies with benefits.Leftist Mamdani used Trump as a bogeyman throughout his mayoral campaign, accusing him of \"fascism\" and comparing the billionaire property developer to the landlords he says are ripping off New Yorkers.He has also cannily positioned himself as part of the resistance to a president who has pushed his power to its limits and sent the National Guard into Democrat-run cities.\"To get to any of us, you will have to go through all of us,\" Mamdani said at the victory rally.For hapless Democrats who have struggled to find a winning message as Trump has savaged them in recent months, Mamdani represents a long-awaited chance to fight back. But for many on the right, Trump now has the ideal opponent to bash.As Republicans nursed their wounds from defeats in New York, Virginia and New Jersey, Trump said in a speech in Miami on Wednesday that Americans now faced a \"choice between communism and common sense.\"Trump also blew a dog whistle to the hard-right.\"Mandami, whatever the hell his name is,\" Trump said in the same speech -- deliberately mispronouncing Ugandan-born Mamdani's surname in the same way he did with his 2024 election rival Kamala Harris.Flashing red lightsYet the stakes are far higher than a war of words.Trump has repeatedly threatened to put New York -- his beloved home city -- in the federal crosshairs like he has previously with Los Angeles and Chicago.\"If he is a communist, there's not going to be a lot of activity,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Thursday. \"So you wouldn't need bridges and tunnels and all the different things that were being planned for New York.\"Some allies meanwhile fear Trump could be playing with fire by focusing on a man whose rise was propelled by the affordability crisis that is now hurting Republicans in the polls.\"There should be flashing red lights all over\" for Trump, former White House strategy guru Steve Bannon told Politico. \"People better understand they have a fight on their hands. This guy is a serious guy.\"Both Trump and Mamdani have also indicated they may ultimately be ready to cool things off.Trump has veered between saying he wants to \"make him succeed\" because he loves New York, and in the same breath urging Mamdani to be \"a little bit respectful of Washington.\" And Mamdani will be aware that his campaign pledges of free city bus travel, childcare and city-run grocery stores will struggle if Trump cuts federal funding.\"I continue to be interested in having a conversation with President Trump on the ways in which we can work together to serve New Yorkers,\" he said on Wednesday.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)","summary":"Donald Trump loves few things more than tackling a new political foe.

Spanberger won Virginia by 57.2% to 42.6% over Earle-Sears. \n\n“‘TRUMP WASN’T ON THE BALLOT, AND SHUTDOWN, WERE THE TWO REASONS THAT REPUBLICANS LOST ELECTIONS TONIGHT,’ according to Pollsters,” President Donald Trump said via Truth Social Tuesday night in a response to the results. \n\nToday marks the longest government shutdown in history, 36 days. The Democrats have voted 14 times to keep the government shutdown though they are still blaming Republicans. \n\nVirginia has the second highest state population of federal workers, following California, and has been heavily impacted by the shutdown. According to the Census Bureau there are 147,358 federal civilian employees as of September 2025 in Virginia.

Not the alleged victim. \n\nNot even the year of my state Senate campaign is accurate.\n\nYet Gemma actually generated fake links to fabricated news articles to support its defamatory claim.\n\nThis is not simply a technical glitch; it is a catastrophic failure of oversight of an AI model downloaded by more than 200 million people.\n\nAnd it’s emblematic of a broader pattern of bias against conservatives within Google’s products.\n\nIn September, Google scrapped a Gmail blacklist that disproportionately suppressed Republican fund-raising emails as spam.\n\nIt had been operating for years: Ahead of the 2020 election, this blacklist flagged nearly 60% more emails from GOP candidates than from Democrats, removing them from recipients’ inboxes before they even had the chance to open them.\n\nDuring last year’s presidential election, the tech giant faced accusations that it manipulated search results to boost positive articles about Kamala Harris and negative coverage of Donald Trump and his campaign.\n\nThe day after the vice-presidential debate, for example, search results for “JD Vance” in Google’s news tab showed exclusively left-leaning outlets, and the search engine also appeared to suppress searches about the attempted assassination of Trump in Butler, Pa.\n\nIt’s not just conservatives who are raising the alarm about the tech company’s bias.\n\nGoogle itself admitted in a letter to the House Judiciary Committee in September that it colluded with the Biden administration to censor individuals who questioned Democrats’ COVID policies, including Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Kennedy, Deputy FBI Director Dan Bongino and Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.).\n\nNow, it appears Google’s political bias has infected its AI models, which have targeted other conservatives with defamation — not just me.\n\nDuring a Senate Commerce Committee hearing last week, I presented evidence to Google vice president Markham Erickson that his company’s AI models have repeatedly fabricated malicious stories about Robby Starbuck, an anti-DEI activist.\n\nIn one instance, Gemma falsely claimed that Starbuck was accused of child rape — and that I publicly defended him.\n\nGoogle’s AI models have also falsely accused Starbuck of being a former adult film actor, of facing criminal drug charges, and of shooting a man in Nashville, Tenn., in an argument over a parking space.\n\nIn response, Erickson claimed that “hallucinations” in Google’s AI models are common, and a problem the company is working to mitigate.\n\nThat response is entirely unacceptable.\n\nLast week, I sent a letter to Google CEO Sundar Pichai demanding an explanation as to why Gemma generated false criminal allegations against me.\n\nI also asked for a list of steps the company is taking to eliminate political bias and defamatory content from its AI models.\n\nGoogle has thus far failed to address my questions — but the company quietly removed Gemma from its AI Studio last weekend.\n\nDespite the AI model’s serious flaws, the big tech giant said it will continue to make Gemma available to developers.\n\nMy message to Google is simple: Shut your AI models down completely until you can control them.\n\nThe American public deserves AI systems that are accurate, fair and transparent — not tools that smear conservatives with manufactured criminal allegations.\n\nWhen Google launched Gemma last year, the company claimed it had developed the AI model to adhere to the company’s “rigorous standards for safe and responsible outputs.”\n\nThey have clearly failed.\n\nNow the American people deserve to see accountability.\n\nMarsha Blackburn represents Tennessee in the US Senate.","summary":"Google's Gemma large language fabricated an elaborate criminal allegation against me — and it's not the first time the company's products have smeared and targeted conservatives.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/11/06/opinion/us-senator-marsha-blackburn-googles-biased-ai-accused-me-of-rape-shut-down-its-rampant-lies/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/newspress-collage-db30xbmkc-1762470957511.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1762452972&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-06 23:49:44","author":"Marsha Blackburn","authors":["Marsha Blackburn"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.397},{"id":376538258,"title":"James Carville says he'd bet money Democrats will win presidency in 2028, pack Supreme Court","text":"Democratic strategist James Carville’s predictions have a checkered history, but he declared he would bet money that a Democrat will win the presidency in 2028 and proceed to pack the Supreme Court.

Pelosi has been a major power player in U.S. politics for decades, serving as Speaker of the House from 2007 to 2011 and again from 2019 to 2023. She is the only woman in American history to hold the position, and she was instrumental in steering through Congress some of the major liberal achievements of the Obama years, in particular the Affordable Care Act.

It’s a reminder that when we come together around strong, forward-looking leaders who care about the issues that matter, we can win,\" Obama posted to X Tuesday as the elections were called and handed Democrats wins in the handful of high-profile elections. \"We’ve still got plenty of work to do, but the future looks a little bit brighter.\" The former president's star power was touted as likely giving a boost to Virginia's Abigail Spanberger and New Jersey's Mikie Sherrill in the lead-up to Tuesday, though his presence became more of a \"side note\" as the Trump administration and its economic policies loomed large over both campaigns. \"The further we get away from the Obama presidency, the more people believe that he didn't get that much accomplished. I don't think many voters are looking backward, even if Obama may still be an iconic voice inside the party,\" former chief counsel to House Judiciary Committee Democrats Julian Epstein told Fox News Digital when asked about Obama's presence at rallies, saying the president was more of a \"side note\" amid the campaign. OBAMA INSISTED BLACK MEN VOTE FOR HARRIS BUT NOW STUMPS AGAINST VIRGINIA'S BLACK LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR Obama endorsed both Virginia Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger and New Jersey Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill in October in video endorsements touting their leadership, while also taking digs at the Trump administration and Republicans. Obama has long served as the Democratic Party's campaign closer, zig-zagging states to drum up support in local, state and federal elections since he departed the White House in 2017. Obama kept that momentum going in 2025, as the party overall still navigates its path forward with new leadership following former Vice President Kamala Harris' election loss to President Donald Trump. Epstein said Democrats are currently benefiting from \"anti-Trump energy,\" noting that \"60% of Virginians think the local economy is good but 2/3rds think the country is headed in the wrong direction.\" \"This is an extraordinary paradox, and it means people don't believe Trump is delivering on the economy,\" he said. \"We still have 3% inflation, and very few voters think their overall economic position is improving.\" The Democrat added that economic and affordability concerns weighed heavily on voters heading to the ballot boxes just a year after electing Trump in an election that also largely focused on the economy and inflation woes from the Biden-era. \"What that should tell Trump is that there's too much noise and too much distraction, and that he needs to focus on getting the economy into overdrive. This means concluding the trade agreements ASAP, reducing the tariffs, and allowing the economy to soar after the tax cuts in deregulation,\" he said. \"First and foremost, the Republicans won because voters trust them more in the economy,\" he said of the 2024 election. \"They need to prove that this trust was not misplaced. All of this would've been exactly the same whether or not Obama showed up.\" In New Jersey, voters reported that the state's notoriously high taxes and the economy were their top issues heading into the polling stations, according to Fox News Voter Poll data. In Virginia, half of voters reported that the economy was their top issue, more than double the number who reported healthcare as their top concern, according to Fox polling data. The Virginia and New Jersey campaigns both focused on deriding the Trump administration as taking the U.S. down the wrong path, including both candidates vowing to ease affordability and housing crisis woes on the state level while battling White House policies as they relate to their states. Obama also took part in slamming the Trump administration while making his pitch to voters. \"Virginia's elections are some of the most important in the country this year. We know Republicans will keep attacking abortion rights and the rights of women. That’s why having the right governor matters, and I’m proud to endorse Abigail Spanberger,\" Obama said in an ad endorsing the Virginia Democrat. \"Republican policies are raising costs on working families so (that) billionaires can get massive tax cuts,\" he said in another ad endorsing Spanberger. Just days after releasing the ads, Obama hit the campaign trail in the candidates' respective states. Obama first traveled to Norfolk, Virginia, Saturday for a Spanberger rally before heading up to New Jersey for a rally in Newark for Sherrill's candidacy. In both speeches, Obama focused his remarks on deriding the Trump administration and offering the Democrats' respective elections as an opportunity to vote against Republican and MAGA policies. \"Let's face it, our country and our politics are in a pretty dark place right now,\" Obama told the Newark audience Saturday. OBAMA THE 'CAMPAIGN CLOSER' FOR DEMOCRATS IN TOP 2025 ELECTIONS AS PARTY AIMS TO REBOUND He said at both rallies: \"Every day, this White House offers up a fresh batch of lawlessness and recklessness and mean-spiritedness and just plain craziness.\" Fox News Digital traveled to Newark for the Sherrill rally featuring Obama, with attendees celebrating that they believed Sherrill would win the election while remarking Obama's presence only helped drive further support. The crowds at the Newark, New Jersey, rally were so large that some supporters were turned away at the door of the rally, which was held at the local community college's gymnasium. \"I heard Barack Obama was gonna be here. And I love Barack Obama, so I really came out here for that,\" one voter, Alexis from South Jersey, told Fox News Digital. \"But I do support Mikie, as well.\" WITH LEGACY ON THE LINE, OBAMA HITTING CAMPAIGN TRAIL TO BOOST DEMOCRATS IN KEY GOVERNOR ELECTIONS \"I want to hear Obama,\" another attendee, Robert, from Spring Lake, told Fox Digital ahead of the election. \"I think a lot of people want to hear Obama. Wouldn't it be great to have a message of hope at this point in time?\" Both candidates notched victories over their Republican challengers as part of a blue wave during the 2025 off-year election cycle, which also delivered a win to Socialist New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani in another high-profile election. Former Republican Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron, who is running for the Senate in Kentucky to replace departing longtime Sen. Mitch McConnell, told Fox Digital that Democrats are still in the midst of finding their footing following their 2024 election losses and promoted Obama's star power to help carry the gubernatorial candidates across the finish line. \"I think when it comes to the Democratic Party, they certainly are trying to figure out what their next steps are, and that means they bring in people from the past and have them be a part of the conversation. We've got a standard-bearer within the Republican Party, and we've got right now in the White House, that standard-bearer is President Trump,\" Cameron told Fox News Digital in an interview Thursday. OBAMA CONTINUES TRADITION OF SLOW-ROLLED POLITICAL ENDORSEMENTS AS GUBERNATORIAL ELECTIONS HIT FEVER PITCH \"President Trump has got the loudest voice in the party. And you know his voice is much bigger than former President Obama's,\" he said. Bradley Devlin, politics editor at The Daily Signal, added that \"whatever the ‘Obama Bump’ might be—assuming there is one at all,\" it would not \"make up for the fact that Obama was the one who set the Democrat party down this path of extremism, taking the side of the 20 in 80-20 issues, and creating the fundamentals for the rise of Trump and the resurgence of conservative politics and American values.\" Trump did not physically campaign in New Jersey or Virginia. He endorsed New Jersey Republican Jack Ciattarelli's candidacy and took part in virtual tele-rallies ahead of the election. Trump additionally did not endorse Virginia Republican candidate Winsome Earle-Sears, and instead promoted Virginia residents vote for GOP Old Dominion State candidates across the board during a tele-rally where the president did not mention Earle-Sears by name. The president wrote on Truth Social late Tuesday as the election results came in that unspecified pollsters reported that Republicans lost the election because Trump was not physically on the ballot, as well as the ongoing shutdown woes since. Oct. 1. White House spokesman Kush Desai told Fox News Digital when asked about the election that \"Americans are grappling with affordability because it was Joe Biden and Democrats who created the worst inflation crisis in decades.\" \"Putting this inflation crisis behind us has been a Day One priority for President Trump. The Administration’s supply-side economic agenda has already cooled inflation to a 2.5 percent annualized rate – half the average inflation rate under Joe Biden. Americans are paying less for essentials like gas and eggs, and today the Administration inked yet another drug pricing deal to deliver unprecedented healthcare savings for everyday Americans,\" Desai continued. \"As President Trump’s agenda of tax cuts, deregulation and energy abundance continues to take effect and real wages continue increasing, Americans can rest assured that the best is yet to come.\" THE ONLY GOP GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATES RUNNING IN 2025 ELECTIONS LEAN INTO TRUMP'S MAGA CAMPAIGN TACTICS CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP Obama previously has campaigned in New Jersey during current Democratic Gov.

In an election characterized by a record voter turnout – over two million New Yorkers voted – Mamdami won with 51% of the vote. Cuomo received 42% and Silwa 7%.\n\nWhat makes Mamdani’s victory significant is that he is a self-styled “democratic socialist” who was elected mayor without being endorsed by the Democratic Party leadership – most of whom, including Chuck Schumer, minority Senate leader from New York, refused to endorse him at all.\n\nMamdani is an intelligent, 34-year-old Muslim of Indian heritage who was born in Uganda. His father is a prominent black studies academic and his mother is an acclaimed filmmaker.\n\nMamdani, a former celebrity rapper, social worker and state assemblyman, ran on a left-wing populist program that focused almost exclusively on alleviating cost-of-living pressures for ordinary New Yorkers – especially young New Yorkers. He promised to deliver rent freezes, free public transport, free childcare, city-owned grocery stores and universal health care. He also promised to build 200,000 affordable new houses with union labor.\n\nWhether Mamdani can actually implement this program is by no means clear – New York city is $5 billion in debt, and the New York state government and governor can severely limit what a New York mayor can do.\n\nMamdami is a strong critic of America’s support for the Netanyahu and Zelensky regimes, and has stated explicitly that he would fund his reforms by increasing taxes on New-York-based large corporations and the ultra-rich that control them.\n\nMamdani’s program is a pragmatic social democratic one – that contrasts starkly with the MAGA populist agenda, which is based on magical thinking, demonizing America’s supposed internal enemies and leaving America’s economic structure and widening inequalities of wealth completely intact.\n\nMamdani maintained throughout his campaign that “unlike Trump I can deliver for the working class.” This is correct – because if his economic program were to be implemented it would really benefit those groups that he represents. In any rational view, cost-of-living pressures on ordinary Americans can only be relieved by redistributing wealth downwards from the haves to the have-nots.\n\nSome left-wing commentators – as does Mamdani himself – have seen Mamdani’s rapid political ascendency as the harbinger of a radical transformation of the Democratic Party – into a party that is, as it once was, focused on representing the traditional working class and other groups in American society that have been economically pauperized and culturally alienated by globalization.\n\nRight-wing commentators have branded Mumdani a “communist,” “terrorist sympathiser” and anti-Semite, and see him as a dangerous threat to American society.\n\nBoth of these views are, however, fundamentally mistaken. Mandami is a perculiarly New York phenomenon, and there is no possibility that his radical economic program will be adopted by the current Democratic Party leadership – despite his claim that his campaign was “a referendum on where the Democratic Party goes.”\n\nNor is Mamdani a serious threat to American society. In fact his reform program is a modest one that, at present, stands little chance of attracting a majority of American voters – who remain content to vote for the flailing and increasingly irrelevant Democratic Party or, alternatively, Trump’s reenergized populist Republican Party.\n\nNew York is a Democrat city and a Democrat state. When Robert Kennedy and Hillary Clinton launched their political careers they ran for the Senate in New York and were elected virtually unopposed. Donald Trump and Elon Musk both implicitly acknowledged this fact when they endorsed Andrew Cuomo rather than Mamdani’s Republican opponent – in a desperate attempt to prevent Mamdani from being elected. New York city has had left-wing populist mayors in the past – most notably Fiorello La Guardia, and more recently, Bill de Blasio.\n\nMamdani is a brilliant grassroots politician who stayed on message throughout his campaign – which was based upon his personal brand and a savvy and sophisticated use of social media. He focused on winning over young New Yorkers who have been left behind by globalization – together with disaffected workers, black people, and members of immigrant communities that have suffered a similar fate. New York is the most expensive city in America to live in.\n\nThe Democratic Party leadership views Mamdani both as an aberration and a threat, and refused to support him. Nor is it surprising that major media networks (both left and right-wing) pointedly refused to endorse Mamdani.\n\nThe modern day Democratic Party – which has not represented the working class for decades – is committed to protecting the interests of the global elites. Hence its slavish adherence to their woke globalist ideologies such as catastrophic climate change, diversity privileges, the #MeToo movement, and so-called transgender “rights” – even though these ideologies continue to alienate an increasingly large number of ordinary American voters.\n\nRoosevelt’s pragmatic New Deal reforms, which broadly favored the working class, trade unions and ethnic minorities, have been progressively wound back since the 1970s – not only by Republican presidents, but just as brutally by Democrat presidents Clinton and Obama.\n\nThat is why the traditional working class, together with large segments of the black and Latino communities, have deserted the Democratic Party over the last decade – and now vote for Trump. They do so not necessarily because they believe in Trump’s populist program, but because they refuse to vote for a party that no longer even pretends to represent them.\n\nIt is true that the Democratic Party has always tolerated left-wing populists – for example William Jennings Bryan, Huey Long, George Wallace and more recently Bernie Sanders (who enthusiastically supported Mamdani) – but only so long as they remained local politicians and did not attempt to radically refashion the party’s economic agenda.\n\nThe Democratic Party can, therefore, live with Mamdani – unless his mayoral victory sparks a wider movement to radicalize the party. If that should occur, Mamdani will be ruthlessly cut down – as Bernie Sanders was in 2016 by Hillary Clinton and the glass-ceiling and transgender-rights brigade.\n\nThe conservative critique of Mamdani and the well-funded smear campaign conducted against him is, of course, absurd and irrational – but crypto McCarthyism and anti-intellectualism are now at the heart of contemporary American politics. Mamdani is not a “communist” or a “terrorist sympathiser.” Nor is he an antisemite – in fact, many New York Jews opposed to the mass killings in Gaza enthusiastically support Mamdani.\n\nIn the UK, Australia, and most European countries Mamdani would be seen as a mainstream social democrat – but in America an explicit social democratic economic agenda has always been demonized as a form of “communism.”\n\nPerceptive American historians in the 1950s, most notably Louis Hartz, viewed America as being perpetually trapped in a liberal capitalist consensus, in which socialism (even in its moderate social democratic form) had failed to emerge as a significant political force – unlike in the UK, Australia and most European nations, where powerful social democratic labor parties have shaped politics since the early 20th century.\n\nThe complete failure of socialism in America also explains why the Democratic Party in the 1970s so eagerly adopted proto-globalist ideologies like affirmative action and gay and women’s rights – and why it remains so firmly wedded to their successor woke globalist ideologies today.\n\nContemporary America is, of course, no longer liberal – indeed it has become illiberal under Trump’s right-wing populist presidency – and that is unlikely to change in the foreseeable future. The “power elites” – a term coined by the historian C. Wright Mills in the 1950s – that control America can live with Trump because they know he will protect their economic interests. Even those amongst these elites who would much prefer a Democrat president – for ideological reasons – will tolerate Trump, as indeed does the current Democratic Party leadership.\n\nThe truth is that the Democratic Party – funded by large corporations and fixated on “culture wars” issues – would rather lose elections to MAGA Republicans than permit a moderate reformist like Mumdani to radically reshape the Party’s economic program.\n\nHow else can one explain the Party’s decisions to run Hillary Clinton for President in 2016; persist with the dysfunctional Biden as a presidential candidate last year; and then replace him with the inept diversity candidate Kamala Harris? Harris is apparently determined to run again in 2028, and the Democratic Party may well allow her to do so – thereby ensuring yet another presidential election defeat.\n\nThe Democratic Party correctly sees Mamdani as a radical threat, but it would rather sponsor endless and pointless ‘No Kings’ demonstrations than adopt an economic program akin to Mamdani’s – that is the only agenda that would allow them to begin to effectively counter Trump’s right-wing populism.\n\nMamdani’s fate, therefore, is likely to mirror that of other American socialists and left-wing populists – his influence will be severely curtailed by the Democratic Party leadership, and he will remain a marginalized and localized New York political figure.\n\nThat is, in large part, because Mamdani’s reformist economic program is still anathema to the vast majority of American voters. His agenda clearly resonates with a majority of disaffected voters in New York city – but it is electoral poison elsewhere, especially in the Mid-West and the American South. Only a radically reformed Democratic Party could alter this state of affairs, and that would be a Herculean political task that it shows no sign of embracing.\n\nMamdani’s likely fate does not augur well for America’s future. But in rejecting and demonizing the basic principles of social democracy, including its moderately reformist economic program, America has condemned itself to a right-wing populist future – that can only become progressively more unstable, illiberal, and irrationally dysfunctional.\n\nTo believe that Zohran Mamdani can single-handedly reverse the current trajectory of contemporary American politics is a pious and naive illusion. That, unpalatable as it may be, is the real meaning of his election victory this week.","summary":"Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani is hated both by Republicans and his own fellow Democrats because he wants to bring change.

A Democrat who was the first woman ever to serve as speaker of the House, her fingerprints are on landmark legislation passed during Barack Obama’s and Joe Biden’s presidencies that affect millions of Americans and today remain among the most contentious topics in the Capitol.\n\nIn a country that grew increasingly polarized during her time in Congress, it should be no surprise that reactions to her departure are textbook examples of America’s partisan extremes.\n\n“Nancy D’Alesandro Pelosi will go down in history as the greatest speaker of all time. Her tenure has been iconic, legendary, historic and transformational,” said Hakeem Jeffries, her successor as House Democratic leader.\n\n“The retirement of Nancy Pelosi is a great thing for America. She was evil, corrupt and only focused on bad things for our country,” Donald Trump told Fox News.\n\nTaking office near what turned out to the tail end of four decades of Democratic control of the House, Pelosi was there to see Congress fulfill her hope of addressing Aids through the passage of the Ryan White Care Act, in 1990. In the years that followed, she climbed the ranks of party leadership until becoming speaker in 2007, following blowout election victories for Democrats the year prior.\n\nUnder Obama, she oversaw passage of the Affordable Care Act, which transformed the nation’s healthcare system, as well as his efforts to revitalize the economy after the 2008 recession. When Biden’s election brought the Democrats back into power in 2021, Pelosi was by his side, wrangling a slim House majority to pass laws that addressed the climate crisis and revamped the nation’s infrastructure and critical industries.\n\nHer collaboration with the two Democratic presidents gained her a reputation as one of the country’s best-known liberals, and a modern trailblazer for female politicians. Perhaps it was inevitable that Trump, who beat two different Democratic candidates to win the presidency and has his own history of sexist comments and troubling conduct, would become her principal antagonist.\n\nPelosi had clashed with George W Bush along with John Boehner and Paul Ryan – the Republicans who succeeded her as speaker after Democrats lost their House majority in the 2010 elections – but her feud with Trump was like few others in Washington.\n\nShortly before she returned as House speaker in 2019, Pelosi and the top Senate Democrat, Chuck Schumer, met with Trump in the Oval Office for what turned into a prolonged, televised squabble. When they got together months later to discuss a volatile situation in Syria, the White House released a photo showing a standing Pelosi pointing her finger at the president. “Nervous Nancy’s unhinged meltdown!” Trump tweeted, though the speaker’s supporters saw plenty to like in her defiant stance.\n\nShe rolled her eyes and did a mocking slow clap at the president’s State of the Union address that year. He refused to shake her hand when they crossed paths in the House chamber for the annual address in 2020, and she tore up his speech at its conclusion. It was no surprise that some of the violent Trump supporters who stormed the US Capitol on January 6 talked about killing her, but, with Pelosi whisked to a military base, could do no more than sack her office. The following year, a man broke into her San Francisco home, looking to take her hostage and interrogate her over the investigation into the first Trump campaign’s ties to Russia. The speaker was not home, and he ended up brutally injuring her husband, Paul Pelosi, with a hammer.\n\nPelosi would oversee Trump’s two impeachments, first for his attempt to spur Ukraine into meddling in the 2020 election, then again for the January 6 attack. It was these dishonors that Trump made a point of mentioning when news broke that she would be stepping down.\n\n“I’m very honored she impeached me twice and failed miserably twice,” he said, having earlier added that “she was rapidly losing control of her party, and it was never coming back”.\n\nIt’s worth dwelling on the last point, considering Pelosi’s last great act in Congress was orchestrating a pressure campaign that ousted Biden, another of Trump’s enemies. Regarded by many in her party as a master tactician even after stepping down and taking the rare title of speaker emerita in 2023, she saw Biden as unelectable and a liability to down-ballot Democratic candidates after his terrible performance in a debate against Trump.\n\nPelosi wanted a competitive process for finding another Democratic nominee, but Biden instead endorsed his vice-president, Kamala Harris, who would go on to decisively lose to Trump, paving the way for his return to power. Her relationship with Biden, meanwhile, was left in tatters.\n\nThe Democratic party went into a tailspin after Harris lost and their candidates failed to hold either chamber of Congress. A year later, the party swept off-year state elections, raising the party’s hopes that its mojo was coming back and Democrats would retake the House in 2026.\n\nHowever it goes, Pelosi will not be there. Two days before announcing her retirement, she held forth to CNN about Trump, calling him “a vile creature, the worst thing on the face of the earth”.\n\nBut she also had some words for the next generation of lawmakers who will arrive in Washington soon enough: “Treat everyone as your friend, but know who your friends are.”","summary":"The former House speaker, who recently announced her retirement, has had a contentious relationship with the president\n\n\nUS politics live – latest updates\n\nNancy Pelosi arrived in Congress in 1987 aiming to spur a reluctant Washington into taking action against the Aids epidemic that was then ravaging the gay community in her home town, San Francisco.\n\nNearly four decades later, she will exit the House of Representatives after a historic career in which she has made her influence felt nationwide.

She’ll be joining the likes of Claudia Conway, daughter of Kellyanne and George, and Ella Emhoff, stepdaughter of Kamala Harris, on a growing list of Zoomers thrust into the public spotlight by their ties to political figures.\n\nAnd as a member of what is widely considered the most online generation, all eyes are on her social media profiles to see how her public posting unfolds.\n\nDuwaji’s Instagram following has already skyrocketed, gaining more than a half-million followers in less than 48 hours since Tuesday’s election. Here’s what we can learn about her from her posts so far.\n\nDemocratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani and his wife, Rama Duwaji, after voting at the Frank Sinatra School of the Arts on November 4, 2025, in Queens, New York City. (Photo by Alexi J. Rosenfeld/Getty Images)\n\nCentering Her Art\n\nThe majority of Duwaji’s posts showcase her work as an illustrator. Some feature her recent editorial work for outlets including Vogue, New York Magazine and The New Yorker.\n\nDuwaji also posts a monthly series in which she shares a carousel of images of things she has seen that make her “want to make art” along with a caption describing each one.\n\nThe most recent post on her Instagram is the October installment of this series, which lists her various artistic inspirations ranging from “Mustafa Nayaz’s hair design that feels almost sculptural” to “The shape of this block of cement I came across while walking around in Astoria.”\n\nKeeping Her Identity Separate\n\nDuwaji has largely kept her Instagram posts apolitical, posting congratulations to her husband for winning the Democratic primary on June 25 but staying quiet about the campaign since then.\n\nMike Fahey, a political analyst and media strategist, told Newsweek that the decision is likely “intentional and strategic.”\n\n“I would have to think that this is a direct reflection of her desire to maintain an independent identity as an artist and illustrator rather than a conventional political spouse,” he said. “While this approach may limit her visibility as a campaign asset, it preserves authenticity and shields her from partisan backlash.”\n\nMichael S. Kowal, a computational social scientist at Stevens Institute who studies how political campaigns use social media, agreed. \n\n“Mamdani has crafted a highly successful social media presence, and there is little necessity to upset that balance by bringing his wife into political discussion. There is probably a significant benefit to them both in having his wife remain largely non-political and in the periphery of the administration,” he told Newsweek.\n\nZohran Mamdani and his wife, Rama Duwaji, from Mamdani’s Instagram.\n\nOne Key Political Cause\n\nOther posts include original artwork, much of which expresses support for Palestine—a cause Mamdani also vocally champions.\n\nKowal told Newsweek that he expects this to continue, especially as it’s not an issue that could damage Mamdani’s reputation, given how openly he has expressed his views.\n\n“This fits with most political spouses, who often have a signature issue that aligns with their backgrounds, such as Laura Bush and literacy,” he said. “Choosing one issue to focus on allows political spouses to spend what political capital they do have wisely and on an issue that they are passionate about.”\n\nGreat Political Asset\n\nAs well as her work as an artist, Duwaji’s Instagram features creative selfies that showcase her style and personality.\n\nFahey said that her “creative, socially conscious brand” will likely become very valuable.\n\n“Her aesthetic, tone and selectivity suggest she aims to be seen as a modern voice—representing a new kind of political partner who connects with younger, progressive audiences while redefining what a public spouse’s role can look like in 2025,” he said.\n\nKowal highlighted that there is a range of involvement political spouses tend to take, but he believes that less can be more.\n\n“For many political spouses in the social media era, remaining above the day-to-day political fray has been the norm,” he said.\n\nFahey concluded: “As New York’s new first lady, her social media presence will likely evolve, but any shift is likely to be measured and values-driven.”","summary":"Zohran Mamdani&#039;s wife is about to become a new kind of First Lady, experts say.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/rama-duwajis-instagram-4-things-we-learned-about-nycs-future-first-lady-11002100","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2244963234_390960.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-06 19:51:08","author":"Sirena Bergman","authors":["Sirena Bergman"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.658},{"id":376501314,"title":"It’s the economy, stupid: Everyday costs become focus of winning campaigns and could hurt Trump in 2026","text":"Donald Trump’s image as a businessman eager to supercharge America’s economy propelled him to victory with independents and Republican votes in 2024, while his opponent Kamala Harris was hamstrung by the sad collapse of her former running mate’s campaign.\n\nNow, as the next election cycle approaches it increasingly looks as if Democrats have recaptured the narrative around economic issues and cost of living — to the detriment of Trump and his MAGA allies in Congress, many of whom are up for re-election in a year. \n\nWinning Democratic campaigns of all political stripes, from Democratic Socialists of America-aligned Zohram Mamdani in New York to center-left Abigail Spanberger in Virginia, made high prices the main focus of their appeals to voters.\n\nAs famed Democratic political consultant James Carville once said: “It's the economy, stupid”\n\nTuesday’s results made it very clear: voters are desperate for relief from high prices caused by inflation and an economy that is transitioning faster and faster towards unstable “gig” work and equally downwardly-mobile professions that fail to provide the economic security enjoyed by previous generations. Every year, Americans tell pollsters that the American Dream is increasingly disappearing as voters see little hope of improving their economic prospects over time. Fewer younger Americans than ever have hopes of owning a home, and the birth rate continues to drop, partially related to the staggering cost of childcare in many cities.\n\nSo what happens next? After Tuesday, Republicans in Washington, D.C., are firmly on notice regarding the danger their party faces in next year’s midterms. Trump himself told a lunch meeting of Senate Republicans that the GOP was being “killed” by the ongoing federal government shutdown, while other MAGA allies like Vivek Ramaswamy were able to put the blame squarely on the Trump administration’s failure to bring down prices over 2025.\n\nBut there’s zero evidence (so far) of any real course corrections being made by the White House. In one revealing headline published by Politico on Wednesday, a White House deputy chief of staff claimed that Trump was going to address the affordability crisis “next year,” an assertion immediately jumped on by Democrats.\n\n“Trump demolished part of the White House to build a ballroom in FOUR DAYS, but he won't focus on affordability until NEXT YEAR. Trump promised to lower costs on DAY ONE,” remarked Sen. Elizabeth Warren.\n\nJames Blair, the White House aide, insisted to Politico’s Dasha Burns: “The president is very keyed into what’s going on, and he recognizes, like anybody, that it takes time to do an economic turnaround, but all the fundamentals are there, and I think you’ll see him be very, very focused on prices and cost of living.”\n\nThe problem for the GOP is simple, however, Trump has already put a good amount of his focus on cost of living and inflation. Or, more accurately, he’s put his focus on convincing Americans that the economy is doing quite well. While taking a much blunter approach than Joe Biden did promoting his Covid recovery from 2021-2024, Trump’s strategy echoes the same false assertions that ultimately failed to convince voters to give Biden’s running mate, Kamala Harris, a chance at the top job.\n\nAt an event on Tuesday, Trump insisted that gas prices were down to “the lowest [point] in two decades”. Kayleigh McEnany, his former press secretary, declared on Fox News that her ex-boss had brought prices down, on average, by $3.00 a gallon. This, too, is a lie. The highest-ever average gas price calculated by AAA, one of the nation’s leading auto insurance companies, was $5.016 per gallon, a staggering figure taken at the heart of the Covid supply chain crisis in 2022, driven by high demand. \n\nBut that figure began dropping over the remainder of 2022, and now sits at $3.084 — a drop of less than $2.00 per gallon.\n\nBut it’s food prices where Trump faces his real problems. The president who once patted himself on the back for knowing what “groceries” are has shown no ability or interest so far in bringing those costs down. The average price of a pound of ground beef, tracked by the Federal Reserve, hit its highest point in more than 10 years (and possibly ever) in August, the most recent month for which data was available. \n\nEgg prices spiked massively in the spring, fueled by a wave of bird flu on poultry farms; those prices have dropped, but are still higher than any point before the Covid pandemic. Americans would be hard-pressed to find food products that haven’t recovered from Covid-era price increases. Other products such as sugar and vegetable oil remain roughly twice as pricy as they were pre-pandemic.\n\nAnd so far, Donald Trump’s only response has been to tell Americans: Don’t believe your lying eyes!\n\nDuring an interview with CBS’s Norah O’Donnell over the weekend, Trump pushed back against assertions that any grocery prices were higher than they were before his term began.\n\n“No, you're wrong,” Trump said when asked about the high prices. \n\n“They went up under Biden. Right now they're going down,” he claimed, then added: “Other than beef, which we're working on, which we can solve very quickly.” \n\n“But with that, the beef price went up a little bit. We're gonna get the beef price down very quickly. It'll be very nice, just like eggs. When I first took over, eggs were double, triple, quadruple what they were. This was because of Biden,” Trump went on. “All of these problems were caused by Biden.”\n\nThe blame-Biden game only works for so long, and on egg prices the fact remains that Americans, before the Covid pandemic, never paid prices as high as $3.50 for a dozen. And Trump’s own allies aren’t giving him cover on this anymore, so why should independents?\n\n“We got our a**** handed to us,” declared Ramaswamy, the MAGA-aligned candidate for governor in Ohio. “Our side needs to focus on affordability.”\n\nAnd another ally of the White House told Politico, matter-of-factly: “People aren’t feeling the promises kept. You won on lowering costs, putting more money back into people’s pockets.

With two, they could begin the impeachment proceedings Speaker Mike Johnson warned was on the table if his party continued to fumble the ball while in possession of unified congressional majorities and the White House.\n\n“President Trump is on the ballot next fall,” he warned on Wednesday. “If we lose the majority...they will try to end the Trump administration.

Some of those states are also expected to be key House battlegrounds in 2026.\n\nThe early and battleground state count excludes if the state is their home state and does not count multiple visits by the same candidate.\n\n\"Anybody who's looking at the 2028 cycle is starting to head out on the road ... Putting an emphasis on states that could determine control of the House is your best bet, and probably should be your only focus between now and the midterms,\" Sawyer Hackett, a veteran Democratic strategist who worked on presidential campaigns for Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Julian Castro, told ABC News.\n\n2025 election states: New Jersey, Virginia, California, New York City\n\nIn New Jersey, Democratic candidate and U.S. Rep. Mikie Sherrill received support on the trail from a crowd of presidential hopefuls, including former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, Arizona Sen. Ruben Gallego, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, California Rep. Ro Khanna, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.\n\nAnd in Virginia, Democratic candidate and former U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger had the support of Beshear, Buttigieg, Emanuel, Gallego, Kelly, Khanna, Moore, Shapiro, and Whitmer.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom, former Vice President Kamala Harris, and Klobuchar separately stumped for \"Proposition 50\" in California, while Khanna and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez stumped for Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani in New York City.\n\nKey early states: Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina\n\nSome of the presidential hopefuls have flocked to states with early nominating contests. The Democratic Party is currently reevaluating its calendar for when those early contests will occur, but Hackett said Democrats hoping to run are still covering their bases.\n\nIowa, which usually boasts first-in-the-nation caucuses, will host a closely watched Senate race next year. The state also has some competitive House seats.\n\nIowa hosted former Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz in March and Buttigieg for a town hall in May, while Gallego visited in August and Emanuel came by in September. Kelly is set to visit in November, while Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen spoke to Iowa Democrats in September.\n\nNew Hampshire, which holds the nation's first presidential primaries and will hold a contested U.S. Senate race in 2026 for the seat being vacated by Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, has hosted several lawmakers. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear visited earlier this month; Gallego and Khanna stopped by in August; Klobuchar was there in July and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker will visit in November.\n\nWhen Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker visited in April, he painted a dire picture for his party.\n\n\"Fellow Democrats, for far too long, we've been guilty of listening to a bunch of do-nothing political types who would tell you that America's house is not on fire, even as the flames were licking their faces,\" Pritzker said.\n\nSouth Carolina, meanwhile, also has an early presidential primary. This year, it saw visits from Beshear, Khanna and Newsom in July -- who told rural residents \"what we're experiencing is America in reverse.\"\n\nKelly visited in September, while Maryland Gov. Wes Moore and Walz visited in late May for South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn's \"Fish Fry\" event, which has often been fertile waters for would-be Pennsylvania Avenue hopefuls.\n\nBoth Walz and Moore have told ABC News previously they are not \"running\" for president or have no plans to run.\n\nBattleground states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin\n\nSeveral 2028 presidential hopefuls have also made their way around the seven battleground states, which have been considered winnable by either party and have an outsized influence on where campaigns place their resources.\n\nA few potential candidates have or plan to pay visits to Arizona, including Ocasio-Cortez, who visited in March as part of the Fighting Oligarchy tour run by independent Sen. Bernie Sanders. Whitmer visited in March, while Booker visited in April and Buttigieg visited in October. Harris, who recently said she'll \"possibly\" run for president again, will be speaking there in April 2026.\n\nArizona has two congressional seats currently held by Republicans viewed as competitive, according to the Cook Political Report.\n\nGeorgia is often the site of both a close presidential race and critical down-ballot races. Khanna visited in August, while Harris made a stop there on her book tour in October.\n\nFurther north, Moore and Khanna have paid visits this year to the battleground state of Michigan, where both President Donald Trump and Democratic Senate candidate Elissa Slotkin won in 2024.\n\nWisconsin, which had the closest margin between Trump and Harris in 2024 of the battleground states, saw visits from Klobuchar in March, Khanna in May, Walz in March and September and Whitmer in October.\n\nNevada, which also often figures early in the presidential primary calendar, saw visits this year from Ocasio-Cortez in March, Pritzker and Khanna in August, and Gallego and Kelly in September.\n\nNorth Carolina saw visits from Pritzker in July and Buttigieg in September. Harris visited for her book tour there in October, while fellow Californian Khanna will drop by in November.\n\nPennsylvania is also a key battleground state. Moore delivered a commencement address at Lincoln University in Gettysburg in May, the same month Gallego and Khanna paid their own visits. Notably, two Republicans in Pennsylvania, Reps. Scott Perry and Ryan Mackenzie, are expecting to face fierce fights to hold onto their seats.\n\nKhanna recently said the party's focus is to win back control of the House, which has a Republican majority.\n\n\"We have already a number of great candidates for 2028 that'll emerge, but right now the focus has to be to take back the House in terms of political priority,\" Khanna told public media organization WHYY.","summary":"One year out from the 2026 midterms, major Democratic Party names have been taking the show on the road, saying that they're helping the party lay the groundwork to battle for the U.S. House.","url":"https://abc13.com/post/2028-presidential-hopefuls-flock-key-battleground-states-where-have-traveled/18121426/","image":"https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/18121494_110625-cc-ap-2-hopefuls-img.png?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-06 19:02:13","author":"ABCNews,Oren Oppenheim","authors":["ABCNews","Oren Oppenheim"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.012},{"id":376480790,"title":"Voters are acting like they were scammed — they should know Trump wasn't alone","text":"It’s a good thing when the Democrats win. There are some who would have you believe the opposite is true. As the New York Times Pitchbot said: “Zohran Mamdani won. So why does it feel like he lost.” He didn’t lose. Neither did statewide Democratic candidates in Virginia, Georgia and New Jersey. Neither did Democrats in towns and cities across America. It was a blue wave that suggests more blue waves to come. Democrats won by unexpected margins and in unexpected places (eg, Bristol, Connecticut). That’s good. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. \n\nThose who would have us doubt the goodness of electoral victory are typically invested in the idea that there are deep, perhaps irreconcilable, differences between Democratic factions. Though the Republicans got shellacked, they are not being asked to rethink their future. Axios reported that it’s the Democrats who must settle a “civil war over the best way to move forward after its crushing losses in 2024.” Do they choose to moderate Democrats or “leftwing” Democrats? It sounds reasonable. It might even sound noble. It’s not. It’s phony.\n\nZohran Mamdani, the mayor-elect of New York, and Abigail Spanberger, the governor-elect of Virginia, are very different Democrats who certainly disagree on policy. That is not a weakness. It’s the strength found in a multi-racial ideologically heterodox organization like the Democrats. Each candidate amassed winning coalitions according to the conditions of their constituencies. That’s all they were thinking about. That’s all any of the winners was thinking about. No one was thinking about whether they speak for the entire Democratic Party in its fight against Donald Trump. That Axios is pretending otherwise is why its reporting about “civil war” is actually concern-trolling.\n\nI would guess, if left to their own devices, a moderate like Spanberger and a progressive like Mamdani could work things out if given sufficient motivation. I think the problem comes when Democratic leaders stop listening to each other and start privileging the perspectives of people who do not have the interests of their party, or those of the people they represent, foremost in their minds. By that, I mean a Washington press corps that has internalized the idea that the Republicans are the only legitimate leaders as well as the idea that the Democrats, even after they win, must seek the Republicans’ consent before using the power they have legitimately earned. \n\nSome centrist Democrats confuse compromise with consent. This prevents them from using the power they have to solve problems that they have told voters they would solve. That, in turn, makes them look weak in comparison to Republicans, who never seek the consent of the Democrats, which in turn, triggers a crisis of faith. Donald Trump has created conditions in which fighters ranging from Mamdani to Spanberger are trusted while middle-of-the-road centrists who can’t decide whether to join the fight open themselves up to contempt from both sides. \n\nSome centrists, and perhaps some progressives, believe they will benefit from a backlash. They will interpret last night’s results as what political scientists call “thermostatic politics” (think: pendulum swing). But the intensity of the blue wave suggests something else. Many voters seem to be reacting as if they were scammed. Every single county in Virginia shifted left, even the whitest, western-most ones. In New Jersey, the Democratic candidate wiped out gains Trump made with Black and Hispanic voters. G Elliott Morris said the best explanation is “that voters didn’t know what they were getting with Trump 2.0 last November, but now they do — and they don’t like it.\" But they didn’t know because our media has been so thoroughly corrupted. It sold them vibes. What they got was fascism.\n\nPollster Tom Bonier put it this way: “None of this is complicated. The GOP ran on affordability in 2024. They gave sanctimonious lectures on cable news on election night about how ‘the silent working class majority’ had spoken. Then they governed as reckless authoritarians, punishing the working class.”\n\nBut it is complicated. If voters really are punishing the Republicans for breaking their promise, they would have wanted to know that Joe Biden presided over the world’s greatest recovery from the covid. Wages were up, debts were down, employment was rarely higher. They would have wanted to know the cost of food and energy was getting back to normal. (Perhaps they would have wanted to know more about Kamala Harris’ plan to prosecute price-gouging.) They would have wanted to know, but didn’t, because they could not hear over the din of Trump’s lies or the media’s obsession with a recession that never came (not to mention reporters making fetish of Joe Biden’s age). If voters are acting like they were scammed, they should know Trump wasn't alone. The media scammed them, too. And the Democrats should never play nice with scammers.\n\nIf what we are seeing were normal “thermostatic politics,” we could expect Trump to modulate. He won’t. He’s going to break more laws, steal more power, take more bribes and keep grinding the working class to dust. His party won’t back off, either, not when it can cheat. (“We have a very favorable election map on the Republican side,” Mike Johnson said today, “And it will be more favorable when all the redistricting stuff is done.”) Voters held Trump and the Republicans accountable last night but they are now pretending voters did no such thing. And as they have since Trump came on the scene, reporters are going to play along. That’s why it’s the Democrats, not the Republicans, who must rethink their future. Failure isn’t a problem for the GOP, but victory is for the Democrats.","summary":"The Democrats won big Tuesday. Here are nine thoughts. \n\n\nIt’s a good thing when the Democrats win.

Flush with that success, Republicans made those gains the foundation of their mid-decade gerrymandering efforts—which have now been countered by a successful California ballot initiative. \n\nAccording to NPR, the new Texas map has an additional five districts that are expected to be safely Republican, four of which are in Hispanic-majority areas.\n\nRedistricting is always a gamble. To create more GOP seats, mapmakers have to siphon off Republican voters from existing districts, making each one a little less safe. That kind of overreach is called a “dummymander”—when a party stretches its base too thin in pursuit of extra seats. \n\nOn paper, it looks like a political masterstroke. But when the tide shifts, those artificially padded districts can collapse all at once. That’s exactly what happened in 2018, when the Texas GOP’s overextended map crumbled under the blue wave, flipping several seats to Democrats. \n\nRelated | Why gerrymandering might not be enough to save the GOP\n\nThe 2026 landscape could easily deliver a sequel, which looks a lot more possible after Tuesday’s election results. \n\nDemocrats swept statewide races in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Georgia. In Virginia, the House of Delegates flipped from a narrow 51-48 GOP edge to a commanding 64-36 Democratic majority in a chamber that Republicans controlled as recently as 2023. \n\nDemocratic voters are energized, and as Trump himself admitted after the vote, his absence from the ballot depresses Republican turnout. \n\nBut just as the Latino swing toward the right was decisive in 2024, this reversal has been just as striking. Multiple polls show that Latino discontent with Trump had already been skyrocketing, and election returns bore this out. \n\nAs Punchbowl News reporter Ally Mutnick noted, three heavily Latino counties in New Jersey that went to Trump in 2024 snapped sharply back to the Democrats. \n\nPolitical analyst Ryan Matsumoto found an even starker example in heavily Latino Paterson, New Jersey. In one precinct, Biden crushed Trump 88.8% to 11.2% in 2020. Four years later, Trump narrowly edged out Kamala Harris 50.3% to 49.7%—a stunning swing of nearly 40 points. \n\nBut in this year’s gubernatorial race, Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill obliterated GOP candidate Jack Ciattarelli 88% to 12%, almost perfectly restoring the 2020 margin. It’s a jaw-dropping reversal that shows just how fleeting Latino flirtation with the GOP really was. \n\nAnd if any state should be watching closely, it’s Texas, where the GOP built its redistricting strategy on the illusion of permanent Latino gains. And if Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is still serious about calling for a new map, these election results might’ve put the kibosh on that too.\n\nThe Trump experiment is over, and the backlash is fierce.","summary":"It’s one of the biggest tragedies of the 2025 presidential election: Donald Trump did exceedingly well with Latino voters. \n\n\n\nThe very communities he mocked and demonized as “criminal” turned out for him in large numbers, driven by economic despair and the same disaffected energy that has boosted the GOP among younger voters.\n\n\n\n\nSomeone holds a sign that reads, “Latinos voten por Trump,” or “Latinos vote for Trump” in 2020.\n\n\nBut Republican arrogance, overreach, and hubris have once again opened the door for Democrats to rebound in the 2026 midterms.\n\n\n\nThe rightward Latino swing was dramatic in Texas, where Trump won Latino voters 55-45 in 2024 after former President Joe Biden carried them 58-41 in 2020.

This list, in no particular order, includes:\n\nBiden was accused in law school of plagiarism. The New York Times wrote: “(Biden’s academic record) disclosed relatively poor grades in college and law school, mixed evaluations from teachers and details of the plagiarism.”\n\nHe said he received “three” college degrees and “went to law school on a full academic scholarship.” PolitiFact said not true.\n\nBiden said he “went back to law school and in fact ended up in the top half of my class.” The AP reported: “But last week Biden released his law school records showing he had graduated 76th in a law school class of 85.”\n\nBiden claims to have met his wife, Jill, on a blind date. The Washington Times, however, wrote: “Bill Stevenson, a prominent Delaware rock-venue owner who was married to Jill from 1970-76, has told media outlets that she met Mr. Biden during his 1972 campaign for Senate, before the accident, and that they later had an affair that broke up the Stevenson marriage.” The Bidens deny this.\n\nBiden said, “For four years, I was a full professor at the University of Pennsylvania.” PolitiFact said, “Biden’s role involved panel discussions and other public appearances, but not classroom teaching.”\n\nAbout Biden’s possession of classified documents, special counsel Robert Hur declined to press charges because a jury would likely view Biden as “an elderly man with a poor memory.” But CNN wrote, “Hur released a searing report Thursday that concluded President Joe Biden willfully retained and disclosed classified military and national security information ...”\n\nBiden also lied about the man who was involved in the fatal vehicle crash that killed his first wife. He falsely claimed that the man was drunk. He was not. The investigator of the accident concluded that Biden’s wife likely caused the accident by driving through a stop sign.\n\nBiden also:\n\nLied about what Trump said about Charlottesville.\n Lied about his civil rights record. He claims he “got arrested” trying to defend a black family; got arrested attempting to visit Nelson Mandela; was “raised in the black church”; and claimed he desegregated movie theaters and restaurants in Wilmington, Delaware. None of this is true.\n Claimed his uncle, a World War II veteran whose plane had been shot down, was eaten by cannibals in New Guinea.\n Accused ex-staffer Tara Reade of lying when she claimed that he sexually assaulted her. Kamala Harris, before becoming Biden’s running mate, sided with Reade.\n Lied about his house almost burning down when there was a small, quickly extinguished fire in the kitchen.\n Lied/misled about his mental decline and the use of the autopen.\n Lied about Afghanistan, claiming no one advised him against the abrupt pullout when two generals testified to the contrary.\n Had his administration claim the southern border was “not open” and later attributed the inability to close the borders to the lack of “comprehensive immigration reform.”\n Mislead the public about the efficacy of the COVID vaccine.\n Lied about “not knowing” about Hunter Biden’s overseas businesses.\n Lied about not pardoning Hunter.\n Lied about the Hunter Biden laptop.\n Omits what Trump said in his speech prior to the Jan. 6 “insurrection.”\n Shall I keep going?\n\nLarry Elder is a bestselling author and nationally syndicated radio talk-show host.

The appeals court panel said Hellerstein’s ruling failed to \"consider whether certain evidence admitted during the state court trial relates to immunized official acts or, if so, whether evidentiary immunity transformed.\" Trump's lawyers argued that former presidents have a right to be tried in federal court for charges related to their time in office.

Normally, such a request must be made within 30 days of an arraignment. Exceptions can be made if \"good cause\" is shown, which Hallerstein said wasn't the case. In a 111-page appeal filed in New York Supreme Court’s Appellate Division in October, Trump's lawyers also argued that Judge Juan Merchan, who presided over the case in which Trump was convicted, refused to recuse himself from the case. They questioned his impartiality due to his past political contributions — donating to both then-President Joe Biden and to a group called \"Stop Republicans PAC.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The lawyers also called into question Merchan’s daughter’s work as the president and part-owner of an advertising company that was paid millions by the Kamala Harris campaign and other Democrats.

Shapiro Claims Voters Are Tired of ‘Extremism’ Despite Mamdani Victory","text":"Democrat Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro sought to tie GOP losses in Tuesday’s election to President Donald Trump, saying voters are weary of the “chaos” he says Trump has sown.\n\n“I think there’s two takeaways: One is that it was a clear message to Donald Trump that folks are tired of the chaos. They’re tired of the extremism,” Shapiro told ABC Action News.\n\nThe Pennsylvania governor is widely seen as a top Democrat contender for president in 2028 and was a finalist to be former Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate in last year’s presidential election.\n\nDemocrats not only notched major victories in New York City with the election of Zohran Mamdani as mayor and New Jersey and Virginia with the election of Democrat governors, but in Shapiro’s home state of Pennsylvania. There, Democrats retained control of the state Supreme Court.\n\nShapiro’s comments may come as a bit of a surprise given that he had previously criticized one of the candidates who won on Tuesday, Mamdani, for tolerating extremists and using the term “globalize the intifada.”\n\n“You have to speak and act with moral clarity, and when supporters of yours say things that are blatantly antisemitic, you can’t leave room for that to just sit there,” Shapiro said in July in an interview with Jewish Insider about Mamdani.\n\nMamdani “also seemed to run a campaign where he left open far too much space for extremists to either use his words or for him to not condemn the words of extremists that said some blatantly antisemitic things,” Shapiro added in the July interview.\n\nMamdani has been criticized for his campaign ideas, including government-subsidized grocery stores, free buses, and a proposal to “shift the tax burden from overtaxed homeowners in the outer boroughs to more expensive homes in richer and whiter neighborhoods.”\n\nNevertheless, Mandani focused on affordability throughout his campaign, which ended in victory on Tuesday night. \n\nReflecting on Tuesday’s blue wave, Shapiro claimed Democrats’ effective campaigning on the affordability crisis propelled Democrats to victory. \n\n“The second storyline is they want people who are focused on meeting their needs, who want to get stuff done for them,” Shapiro said. “Whether you’re talking about the Luzerne County Council county race, or the Bucks County DA’s race, or the Erie County executive race, or, of course, the governors’ races in Virginia, New Jersey, or the mayor’s race in New York. There was a through line throughout.”\n\n“The candidates spoke about the issues that mattered in their communities. They had plans to lower costs,“ Shapiro continued. “They had plans to address unique needs in that community, in that state.”\n\n“At the same time, voters went to the polls to say to Donald Trump, ‘We don’t like what you’re doing,’” Shapiro said. “And what you’re doing is making prices go up, bringing chaos into our communities, and restricting our freedom and compromising our democracy.”\n\nShapiro’s office was not immediately available for comment.","summary":"Democrat Pennsylvania Gov.

After explaining why she wanted to focus on beauty and fashion in her third book, she discussed the “renovating” that President Donald Trump has unleashed on the White House’s East Wing, which has traditionally been the office and domain of the first lady.\n“When we talk about the East Wing, it is the heart of the work. And to denigrate it, to tear it down, to pretend like it doesn’t matter—it’s a reflection of how you think of that role,” Obama said. “Whether the West Wing understood it or not, I used to tell them: All the stuff we do on the East Wing, from the clothes I wear to [family dogs] Bo and Sunny to Malia and Sasha and grandma, those were five extra approval points that he got, because we provided a balance.”\nAt the beginning of the talk, Obama turned to the topic at hand. In the past, she said, she’d avoided talking too openly about fashion—an intentional effort not to overshadow both her husband’s efforts and her own work on initiatives like the Let’s Move campaign. But as she noted, January 2016 will mark 10 years since she and her husband, Barack Obama, left the White House. The Look came about because Obama was feeling nostalgic for that moment, and wanted to spotlight the team who kept her looking immaculate—helping her focus on the work of being first lady by handling all the details.\n“I wanted to wait until it felt like it was time,” Obama said. “I wrote two books, and I really do feel like the world, and the country, knows who I am. So now it’s time to talk about the how of fashion because I knew it was always important.”\nJenna Lyons—the designer and former Real Housewife who was interviewed for the podcast companion to The Look—was in the audience at BAM. While filing out of the theater, she told Vanity Fair that the book made her nostalgic for the era’s politics above all else. “It’s nice to be a part of that history, and be connected to something that is so meaningful to not just me, but so many of the other people,” she said. “That whole era had so much attached to it: pride and hope and excitement and feeling like things were changing. We were moving forward, and I can’t say that I feel that now. And it’s really devastating.”\nThe night’s interstitial soundtrack included artists that appealed to the Obamas’ shared musical sensibility—D’Angelo, Solange Knowles, “Candy” by ’80s funk band Cameo—and gave the event the air of a dance party. Once the audience members began removing their stylish coats, it became clear many of them were sartorially inspired by Obama’s eclectic White House–era professional style. A handful of women in hats, striped dresses, and sharp separates also seemed to be drawing from the more modern eye-catching looks she’s embraced since she returned to civilian life. When Obama mentioned her dress’s designer, it prompted a whoop from a woman in the crowd wearing Loewe sneakers and a fringed jacket.\nIn the nearly 10 years since she left the White House, Obama’s book events have turned her into an in-demand entertainer. Part pop star, part Mark Twain as an after-dinner speaker, she uses these events to show off a sense of humor that was usually under wraps during her East Wing years. This time around, her jokes included teasing Ross for her posh upbringing, putting their genuine friendship on display. “My mother was not Diana Ross. I love my mother, but my mother was the opposite of Diana,” Obama teased. When Ross mentioned that shop owners would occasionally judge and surveil her when they didn’t know who her mother was, Michelle batted it away: “You look just like her, girl.” With a laugh, Ross replied, “Not with glasses and braces!”\nNow that IMO, the podcast she normally cohosts with her brother Craig Robinson, is firmly established, it seems Obama has decided to spend her post–White House years as a content creator—and decidedly not as a politician. Wednesday’s event took place exactly one year after Kamala Harris’s loss in the 2024 election; onstage Obama reiterated her disappointment that America didn’t choose to elect its first female president last year.\n“As we saw in this past election, sadly we ain’t ready. Let me just say, my disappointment in the number of men and men of color that would not vote for a woman…” she said, interrupted by thunderous applause and cheers from the crowd. “That’s why I’m like, ‘Don’t even look at me about running, because you all are lying. You’re not ready.’”","summary":"At a Brooklyn event for her new book, The Look, the former first lady talked fashion, life after the White House, and how she really feels about that incoming ballroom: “When we talk about the East Wing, it is the heart of the work.

His platform has drawn criticism from moderates and Republicans alike, who accuse him of pushing “radical,” “communist,” and populist ideas, while supporters argue his proposals address New York’s worsening housing crisis and inequality.\n\nTrump’s decision to make the remark in Miami appeared deliberate. The city has long been home to large Cuban and Venezuelan communities, which helped shape its reputation as a haven for those escaping socialist and communist countries.\n\nPopular opinion in the US has long viewed the ideology as a threat to democracy and free markets. Washington has pursued a global strategy of containment, intervening in conflicts such as Korea and Vietnam, supporting anti-communist regimes, and engaging in a Cold War with the Soviet Union.\n\nAnalysts note that Trump often uses the term as a rhetorical weapon to discredit opponents rather than as a literal label.

Gavin Newsom’s pet project to stick it to President Donald Trump. Did you vote? Did you get a family member or friend to vote? Have you ever registered a Republican in the state? Have you spent any dollar amount on or time volunteering for a campaign? If you didn’t, stop complaining.\n\nIs California hopeless? I don’t think so. Sure, we don’t have that many registered Republicans in the state (although after the wildfires in January, the GOP did see people changing their party affiliation). And we only have nine Republicans representing us in the House of Representatives. But that was nine too many for the majority Democratic state. I guess Democrats couldn’t be happy with their supermajority in Sacramento.\n\nPropositions are confusing, expensive, and often presented in a way that suggests they will help communities in the state. And yet, a pleasant surprise occurred in 2020 when Prop 16 did not pass. It failed because average voters and immigrant communities in the state said “no” to affirmative action. The proposition wanted to change the California constitution to allow organizations, schools, and business to use race and religion for hiring decisions. Not American, and not Californian either. \n\nThen-Vice President Kamala Harris knew she had the California delegates in the bag when she was running as President Joe Biden’s last-minute stand-in in 2024, but even the most staunch Republicans were stunned at the move to the right in the presidential election within the state. Trump won everything but the urban areas, all areas Prop 50 is now gerrymandering because Democrats claim they’re combating Texas’s redistricting. In reality, they appear to be afraid of midterm election losses, given the GOP’s statewide gains in 2024.\n\nThe president’s numbers in 2024, despite a lot of GOP voters fleeing the state after 2020, were similar to his 2020 results in the state. Democrats lost two million voters: Biden garnered over 11 million votes in 2020, and Harris was right at nine million in 2024. \n\nNewsom knows that his policies and his party aren’t that appealing to average voters, especially after the horrific Southern California fires. Democrats losing voters is a good thing in this state; they clearly have plenty of votes to spare. But the Republicans do not, which is why we need a serious postmortem on where all the GOP voters go when we have a vital special election on the ballot.\n\nI often have to inform people who gripe about the lack of forward momentum here in the state that if everyone who had voted for Trump in 2020 had voted in the recall of Newsom, he wouldn’t be our governor.\n\nIf all of the 2024 voters for Trump in California had shown up on Tuesday, Democrats would not have won their change to our state constitution to allow their gerrymandering. Our independent commission for redistricting was one of only a handful in the country and had been praised by left and right — before Newsom and the Democratic National Committee recognized they could distract from that truth by fearmongering about Trump.\n\nCalifornia Republicans are used to losing, but we don’t have to. The GOP needs to rely not just on Democrats becoming disenchanted with the growth of antisemitism and socialism in their ranks. We need to be actively recruiting and engaging our voters.\n\nElisha Krauss is a conservative commentator and speaker who resides in Los Angeles, California, with her husband and their four children.

Nancy Pelosi, the first woman Speaker of the House, announced Thursday after 40 years representing California in the U.S. Congress that she will not seek re-election.\n\nPelosi, 85, posted a video on X saying that she is retiring. She expressed her love of San Francisco in the nearly 6 minute video and mentioned her titles of Speaker of the House, leader and whip, but \"there has been no greater honor for me than to stand on the House floor and say I speak for the people of San Francisco.\"\n\nPelosi's current term is her first in a non-leadership role since 2001. Her retirement comes just two days after the passage of California's ballot measure to redraw its Congressional districts, which she pushed for. She raised tens of millions of dollars for the measure, a person familiar with the efforts told CNN. She worked with California Gov. Gavin Newsom to get Prop 50 passed, and it won with 63% of the vote.\n\n\"I will not be seeking reelection to Congress. With a grateful heart, I look forward to my final year of service as your proud representative,\" she said. \"As we go forward, my message to the city I love is this: San Francisco, know your power. We have made history, we have made progress, we have always led the way. And now we must continue to do so by remaining full participants in our democracy and fighting for the American ideals we hold dear.\"\n\nPelosi grew up in Baltimore, in the Little Italy neighborhood. Her father, Thomas D'Alesandro Jr., was a mayor of Baltimore and then U.S. Congressman representing Maryland. Her brother, Thomas D'Alesandro III, also served as mayor of the city.\n\nAfter getting married in 1962, she began volunteering for the Democrats in California, eventually rising to state chair. She was elected to Congress in a special election in 1987, becoming minority whip in 2001, and minority leader in 2002. She was Speaker of the House from 2007-2011 and again from 2019-2023. She was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Joe Biden in 2024.\n\nPelosi was known for almost never losing a vote on the House floor. To achieve her goals, she would block her rivals from powerful committees as well as use her keen negotiating skills, CNN reported. She often told Democrats to run on a platform of challenging her if it would help them win.\n\nBefore her retirement announcement, Democrats in Washington were praising her and her work as historic.\n\n\"Nancy Pelosi is an iconic, legendary, transformational figure, who has done so many things over so many years to make life better for so many people,\" Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., told reporters Monday.\n\nIn her latest role as representative with no leadership responsibilities, she was able to advise younger representatives and continue fundraising for the party. In last year's presidential race, Pelosi was the most influential at convincing Biden to drop out of the race after an painful debate performance. Democrats hoped allowing Vice President Kamala Harris to run would prevent Donald Trump from winning, though it didn't work.\n\nAfter years of demonization from Republicans, Pelosi's husband Paul paid a price in 2022, when a man broke into their San Francisco home and attacked him with a hammer. It wasn't long after the attack that she stepped down from leadership.\n\nIn her floor speech announcing the decision, Pelosi urged the sides to put aside their differences.\n\n\"American Democracy is majestic -- but it is fragile,\" Pelosi said. \"Many of us here have witnessed its fragility firsthand -- tragically, in this chamber. And so, Democracy must be forever defended from forces that wish it harm.\"","summary":"Rep.

Vance,' she told the Daily Mail. 'And my prayer is that his running mate is Marco Rubio. I think they'll clean up, those two together. I think that's a dream ticket.'\n\nShe added: 'Trump said it the other day, and I agree. Trump, interestingly, always mentions Marco when somebody asks him who's the heir apparent, who's going to be the next president? They always say, \"Is it J.D., is it J.D.?\" and he always says, \"J.D. is great, and Marco, and Marco.\"\n\n'So, you know, it's interesting, Trump's definitely making room for Marco. And then last week, he explicitly said they'd be great on a joint ticket.'\n\nSpeaking on Air Force One last week, Trump said: 'We have J.D., obviously, the Vice President is great. Marco is great. I think I'm not sure if anybody would run against those two. I think if they ever formed a group, it would be unstoppable.'\n\nLater, Vance revealed that Trump had mentioned the idea to him at lunch six months ago\n\nVance said he then mentioned it to Secretary of State Rubio 'in jest.'\n\nMeanwhile, Kelly also revealed her hope that the the Democrats would nominate Kamala Harris.\n\n'On team blue please God let it be Kamala Harris again,' she said. 'Would we be that lucky? Please Lord, if I've done anything to please you ever, please make it be Kamala Harris again. If I'm a good person, God will reward me with another Kamala run.'\n\nHowever, according to prediction website Kalshi, California governor Gavin Newsom is currently the clear favorite for the Democratic pick.\n\nNewsom recently launched his own podcast and has been copying the president's style on social media, blasting out messages in all-caps.\n\nTearing into Newsom, Kelly said: 'It's so pathetic. It doesn't work. It's not clever. The reason it works for Trump is it's Trump, it's authentic to him, it's original, it's funny, Trump's funny. Just trying to imitate somebody, it's not interesting.\n\n'So maybe it makes him feel good because he gets a few more clicks, but it does not moving the needle for him at all.'\n\nShe added of Newsom: 'He's got the right hair. He's tall. People like handsome politicians and, though I'm not a Gavin Newsom fan, you can't take that away from him, he's a good looking guy. He's been trying to train himself with his podcast and he's a far-left man who could get through the Democrat primary.'\n\nMeanwhile, she gave Trump a 'solid A' grade for the first 10 months of his second term.\n\n'I would give him a solid A, I think he's doing great,' she said. 'I think the only reason he's not getting an A plus is because, it's not exactly his fault, but we don't have a lot of legislation passing, it's mostly executive orders.\n\n'Because the reality is, unless you control 60 seats in the Senate you kind of can't get legislation through, that's really unfortunate.\n\n'But he's fighting every step of the way and winning. I love it, it's great, he is a fighter, he's never going to roll over, that's important, a lesser man would have.\n\n'So I love the initiatives, all the things that made me show up and campaign for Trump, he's living up to.'\n\nShe said the biggest challenges Trump faced going forward were foreign policy and inflation.\n\n'China's tough, a tough nut to crack and I think Trump is experiencing that firsthand,' she said. 'And Vladimir Putin is proving to Trump daily that he cannot be trusted, and that, as Trump put it the other day, he just really wants to continue this war. So this is proving to be a lot harder to settle than Trump thought it was.\n\n'And then back at home, people are still feeling the pain of inflation because it's baked into so many of the prices, and it really was ensconced by Joe Biden in so many of the goods that we buy.\n\n'Trump's trying, he's trying in many ways, and I think he's got his long-term tariff policy that he thinks will help with that, but it's going to take a bit. So he's asking for patience, and I think people will give him patience. We're not even a year in, but it's definitely on the list of biggest challenges.","summary":"The conservative media star also revealed who she hoped Democrats would nominate.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15258429/Megyn-Kelly-Republicans-2028-president-vice-president.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/11/04/19/103590149-0-image-a-55_1762284045074.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-06 16:44:50","author":"Editor,Nick Allen","authors":["Editor","Nick Allen"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.264},{"id":376442900,"title":"How Gen Z Hurt Republicans in Elections Across the Country","text":"Democrats notched a series of sweeping victories in key races across the country this week, buoyed in part by surging support from young voters. \n\nIn New York City, 34-year-old Zohran Mamdani became the city’s first Muslim mayor after defeating Trump-backed independent Andrew Cuomo in a race defined by record youth turnout. \n\nIn Virginia, Abigail Spanberger secured the governorship with a decisive lead over Republican Winsome Earle-Sears, while Mikie Sherrill prevailed in New Jersey following a campaign centered on affordability and public safety. \n\nMeanwhile, California voters passed Proposition 50, a redistricting measure championed by Governor Gavin Newsom that could flip several Republican-held congressional seats.\n\nTogether, the results point to a growing generational realignment: voters under 30 — who turned out in unusually high numbers — overwhelmingly backed Democratic candidates.\n\nThis combination of photos taken on Tuesday, Nov. 4, 2025, shows Abigail Spanberger in Richmond, Va., left, Zohran Mamdani in New York, center, and Mikie Sherrill in East Brunswick, N.J. \n\nCNN Exit polls show that 70 percent of 18-29-year-olds voted for Spanberger in Virginia. And in New Jersey, 68 percent voted for Sherrill. Meanwhile, in New York, 78 percent of the youngest voters voted for Mamdani.\n\nIn California, 79 percent of 18-29-year-olds supported Proposition 50. \n\nAnd while turnout figures have not yet been confirmed, early voting data from New York suggests Gen Z voters came out in droves to support Mamdani. An October Quinnipiac University poll found that 62 percent of people aged 18 to 34 years support him.\n\nFrom Disillusionment to Revival\n\nThe renewed energy among young voters comes after they briefly warmed to Trump during the 2024 election. According to AP VoteCast, voters aged 18 to 29 backed Kamala Harris over Trump by just 51 percent to 47 percent in 2024, a far smaller margin than Joe Biden’s 61–36 victory among the same age group in 2020. \n\nAnd Trump made huge headways among young men in particular. In 2024, 53 percent of men aged 18–44 backed him, up from 45 percent in 2020, when Joe Biden carried the group with 52 percent.\n\nThe result prompted fears from Democrats that the party had abandoned some of its youngest voters.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama addressed this sense of neglect on Michelle Obama‘s podcast, reflecting, “We don’t think about boys and just assume they’re going to be okay because they’ve been running the world and they’ve got all the advantages relative to the girls. We’ve made that mistake sometimes in terms of our rhetoric. Where it’s like we’re constantly talking about what’s wrong with the boys, instead of what’s right with them.”\n\nAnd on an episode of his podcast in May, Governor Newsom called on Democrats to “get out of our own damn bubble” and examine the social and economic forces that paved Trump’s path back to the White House in November.\n\n“I just think we need to really have a deep introspection, and we need to own up to what has happened over the last few elections, not just this election,” he said. “I think we’ve got to square with our agenda and where the American people are.” \n\nMeanwhile, focus groups led by centrist pro-Democratic organizations Third Way and HIT Strategies found that men aged 18 to 29 in swing states felt abandoned by Democrats during the 2024 election, saying the party had left them with “resentment and hopelessness” about their economic prospects.\n\n“The young men in our focus groups have been feeling an economic burden that has not been meaningfully addressed—affording everyday life, getting a good-paying job to provide for their family, and being able to do better than their parents. They feel economic expectations are stacked against them as young men, especially as fewer men enroll in college compared with women—something they attribute to a lack of support from their families and communities, which often pushes them into blue collar work,” the report stated.\n\nBut the most recent election results suggest that the Democratic Party has revived its appeal with Gen Z voters — even young men.\n\nYoung Men Go Blue\n\nCNN exit polls show that men aged 18-29 are opting for the Democratic ticket in Virginia, New Jersey, and New York, and are supporting Proposition 50 in California.\n\nIn Virginia, CNN exit polls indicate that Spanberger drew strong backing from younger men, earning 57 percent of the vote among those aged 18 to 29—a 15-point advantage and her highest level of support among any male age group. Support for Spanberger decreased steadily as age increased, dropping to 52 percent among men aged 30 to 44 and reaching 42 percent among men 65 and older.\n\nYoung women proved to be an even more reliable base for Spanberger, with 81 percent of women under 30 casting their ballots for her—24 points highe...","summary":"The most recent election results suggest that the Democratic party has revived its appeal with Gen Z voters, and even young men.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/how-gen-z-hurt-republicans-elections-10995250","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AP25309534155203-1.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-06 16:31:29","author":"Martha McHardy","authors":["Martha McHardy"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.222},{"id":376483372,"title":"Trump Officials Admit Math Error in Plan to Gut SNAP Funding","text":"Representative Nancy Pelosi is making room for a new generation of Democrats.\n\nThe former House speaker announced Thursday she will retire at the end of her current term.

Kaohly Her, who was elected St. Paul mayor, and Amanda Hemmingsen-Jaeger, who was elected to the Senate, leave two open House seats in St. Paul and Woodbury, respectively, that will drive Minnesota to eight special elections in 2025 alone — topping the state’s record of six in 1994.\n\nThe six special elections held this year were triggered by the resignation of Sen. Nicole Mitchell, the death of Sen. Bruce Anderson, the assassination of Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman, the resignation of former Sen. Justin Eichorn, the residency dispute involving Rep.-elect Curtis Johnson and the death of former Sen. Kari Dziedzic.\n\nWhile the two open seats could potentially swing the chamber’s tie, in 2024, Her won the House seat in District 64A with 83% of the vote, and Hemmingsen-Jaeger won the House seat in District 47A with 61%.\n\nHouse DFL Leader Rep. Zack Stephenson, DFL-Coon Rapids, said he expects to retain both of the seats, preserving the 67-67 House tie, after Gov. Tim Walz sets the special elections.\n\n“The House DFL Caucus is full of talent, and I am pleased the voters of St. Paul, Maplewood and Woodbury recognized that,” Stephenson said. “The two vacant seats are in strong DFL areas where Kamala Harris defeated Donald Trump by 70 and 25 points, respectively.

Despite being a longstanding member of San Francisco’s elite, Newsom has recently attempted to portray a narrative of rising from a challenging childhood, sparking widespread skepticism.\n\nThough Newsom, 58, is well known for his connections to some of California’s most influential families—who played pivotal roles in supporting his early business endeavors and political journey—sources reveal his upbringing was far from deprived, as reported by the Daily Mail.\n\nEven those closest to Newsom concede that his early years were not marked by significant hardship. However, this hasn’t deterred him from crafting a story of overcoming adversity.\n\nDuring an October 25th interview on the “All The Smoke” podcast, hosted by former NBA champions Matt Barnes and Stephen Jackson, Newsom recounted his formative years as a time focused on “paying the bills” and engaging in what he described as a constant “hustling” effort.\n\nBut that hasn’t stopped Newsom from painting himself as a graduate of the school of hard knocks.\n\nDuring his October 25 appearance on the All The Smoke podcast, hosted by former NBA champions Matt Barnes and Stephen Jackson, Newsom described his upbringing as being ‘about paying the bills, man… It was just, like, hustling.’\n\nAfter his parents divorced in the early 1970s, he was raised by his hard-working single mother – first in a San Francisco home now worth about $3.6million and later in equally affluent Marin County. Newsom’s mother, Tessa, worked three jobs to support her two children, and his father’s highest salary throughout his career as a judge was $75,000, according to SFGate.\n\nThe paper described them as having ‘enviable connections’ but ‘little money.’\n\n‘I was out there kind of raising myself…’ he said on the podcast. ‘I was sitting there with the Wonder Bread… macaroni and cheese.’\n\nA number of longtime Newsom observers in California called his tale a farce, and said he and his allies have long pushed the story of his allegedly underprivileged childhood.\n\n‘He talks about his poor mother, working her fingers to the bone, as if he went barefoot to school,’ Dan Walters, a columnist with CalMatters who has covered California politics for 50 years, told the Daily Mail.\n\n‘Yeah, barefoot to private school in Marin County.’\n\nKevin Dalton, a political activist and longtime critic of Newsom, claims the governor tailors his story to fit his audience.\n\n‘He’s a chameleon and will bend and shapeshift and change colors, you know, whatever suits his current environment,’ Dalton told the Daily Mail.\n\n‘You can hear it with his speech, you can hear it with his stories. He’s never once talked about eating Wonder Bread and mac and cheese, but all of a sudden he’s in a room with a bunch of ex-NBA ballers and this stuff starts coming up. It’s perfect.’\n\nNewsom’s upbringing was complicated, but far from impoverished, according to most accounts of his life.\n\nHis parents divorced when he was young, and his father, William Newsom III, was a well-connected San Francisco lawyer who later became a judge – and then became the family lawyer for the Getty oil dynasty.\n\nHis mother, who died of breast cancer in 2002 at age 55, did work multiple jobs when Newsom was a kid. But Walters said he still ‘had an upper-class upbringing of a sort.’\n\n‘He wasn’t a latchkey kid scrambling for food.’\n\nBefore Newsom’s parents divorced in 1971, the family took in young Gordon Getty, son of oil tycoon J Paul Getty, and gave him what Walters called ‘some family structure.’\n\nThe Gettys, one of America’s richest dynasties, in turn helped provide Newsom with an entrée into San Francisco’s upper crust and politics.\n\n‘The two families – the Newsoms and the Gettys – have been intertwined for decades,’ Walters told the Daily Mail. He said there were two other powerful San Francisco families in the mix – the Pelosis and Browns (the latter being the family of Governor Edmund Gerald ‘Pat’ Brown).\n\nThe Newsom, Pelosi and Getty families are godparents to one another’s children and make appearances at important family events, according to James Reginato’s book, Growing up Getty.\n\nNewsom’s father’s legal work for the Getty family brought them into the orbit of immense wealth – and even danger.\n\nBack in the 1960s, J Paul Getty’s grandson, John Paul Getty III, was kidnapped in Italy and had his ear cut off. The ransom was then delivered by Newsom’s father, who was the young man’s godfather.\n\n‘He was sort of a legal gopher for the Gettys,’ Walters said. But that Getty connection paid off in very big ways.\n\nIn the 1980s, while serving as an appellate court judge, Newsom’s father helped push through a bill that changed California trust law, a move that gave Gordon Getty control of his billion-dollar inheritance.\n\n‘It was a huge deal,’ Walters told the Daily Mail. ‘We’re talking about a billion-dollar gesture for his pals.’\n\nShortly afterward, Judge Newsom resigned and became trustee of the Gordon Getty Trust.\n\n‘He stayed on the bench long enough to help make the law that benefited Getty, and then went to work for him,’ Walters said. ‘And no one ever said a word.’\n\nMike Netter, co-chair of the Rebuild California movement and one of the leaders of the failed 2020 attempt to recall Newsom, has no patience with the governor’s tales of alleged childhood poverty.\n\n‘Basically, Gavin Newsom was born into this tiny elite group of people who took power about 40 or 50 years ago and have been running the state of California ever since,’ Netter told the Daily Mail.\n\nPrior to running for public office, Newsom became a millionaire with his first venture, PlumpJack winery, which he started at age 24 with Billy Getty (pictured together with Peter Getty in 1992)\n\n‘San Francisco is like a city back East, the only one of its kind out here. These people – the Gettys, the Newsoms, the Pelosis, Dianne Feinstein, Kamala Harris, former San Francisco mayor Willie Brown – grew up without any opposing views and took over California.\n\n‘The problem with Newsom is the same problem we see in the state. It’s too much of a one-party, one viewpoint state.’\n\nNetter also pointed out that Newsom became a millionaire with his first business venture, PlumpJack winery, which he started at age 24.\n\nThe website for the winery says it began as a ‘humble wine store’ in San Francisco, but it was, in fact, funded by Gordon Getty with his son Billy Getty as his partner.\n\nThe name came from an opera Gordon Getty wrote called Plump Jack, which comes from the nickname for Sir John Falstaff, one of Shakespeare’s most famous comic characters.\n\nBy 2003, as Newsom prepared his run for San Francisco mayor, the PlumpJack group of businesses had turned him into a millionaire on paper – with holdings valued between $6million and $7million – and were generating hundreds of thousands of dollars annually, fueled in large part by Getty family investments.\n\nBut the Newsom family’s political reach extended far beyond the Gettys.\n\nNewsom’s grandfather, William Newsom II, was close to Pat Brown, California’s governor in the 1950s and ’60s. Later on, Newsom’s father was appointed to the appellate court by Pat’s son, Governor Jerry Brown.\n\n‘These families… they’ve all been connected by politics, marriage and money,’ Walters told the Daily Mail.\n\nWalters credits Willie Brown (no relation to Pat or Jerry) with launching both Newsom’s and Kamala Harris’s political careers.\n\n‘Willie Brown was king of San Francisco,’ Walters said. ‘He could make or break anyone – and he made Gavin… without Willie Brown, Gavin Newsom wouldn’t exist politically.’\n\nIn addition to the family tree of political entanglement, Newsom’s personal life has fallen equally under a microscope.\n\n‘His father had a big drinking problem – a very big one – and so did Gavin later, which is why he quit drinking,’ Walters told the Daily Mail. ‘It’s a family disease.’\n\nIn a 2007 interview with SFGate, Newsom said he ‘didn’t know’ if he was an alcoholic or not, but said he was seeking treatment for alcohol.\n\nHe revealed that he had been attending nightly counseling sessions, which were helping him examine why he felt the need to ‘drink to an extreme.’\n\n‘I don’t need to drink now. I need more time to reflect,’ he said at the time. ‘I’ve got to be ready, focused and clear.’\n\nHowever, in later interviews, he denied having gone into any formal treatment program.\n\nHe told the Sacramento Bee in 2018 that he had resumed drinking – reportedly a little bit of wine every now and then – after a period of abstinence.\n\n‘No, there’s no rehab. I just stopped,’ he said. ‘There was no treatment, no nothing related to any of that stuff. I stopped because I thought it was a good thing to stop.’\n\nNewsom’s love life has also been a focal point for some.\n\nDuring the same 2007 interview with SFGate, he publicly acknowledged – and apologized for – an affair he had with his appointment secretary Ruby Rippey‑Tourk in 2005.\n\nWhile Newsom was in the process of divorcing first wife, Kimberly Guilfoyle, he became involved with Rippey‑Tourk, who was also the wife of his campaign manager. (Newsom was still legally married at the time, but was divorcing.)\n\nIn the interview, Newsom called it ‘something I’ll for the rest of my life regret.’\n\nHe married his first wife, attorney and legal commentator Guilfoyle, in 2001, and they divorced in 2005.\n\n‘They were a wonderful couple,’ a prominent San Francisco socialite, who has known Newsom since he was a child, told the Daily Mail.\n\n‘It was just a matter of bad timing. Kimberly wanted a baby, and at that time, Gavin didn’t. It was too soon.\n\nNewsom faced a gubernatorial recall in 2020 due to his oppressive COVID restrictions and a bumpy vaccine roll-out during the pandemic\n\nNewsom then married actress and documentary filmmaker Jennifer Lynn Siebel, in 2008.\n\nTogether they have four children, split their time between a $9million mansion in Marin County and a $3million home in Sacramento, and look like the picture-perfect family. But Siebel comes with her own considerable baggage.\n\nIn 1981, when Siebel, then six years old, was with her family in Hawaii, she and her older sister were playing with golf carts. Siebel accidentally backed her cart into her sister who had been hiding behind it, killing her.\n\nSiebel said she has been plagued with survivor’s guilt ever since.\n\n‘I felt the pressure to be perfect,’ she told Entertainment Tonight, ‘to make my parents forget, by being two daughters instead of one.’\n\nSiebel also publicly accused Harvey Weinstein of rape and sexual assault, and was one of the women who testified against him in his 2022 Los Angeles criminal trial.\n\nShe said she first met Weinstein in 2005 when she was an aspiring actress and filmmaker, and later agreed to meet him in a Beverly Hills hotel room where she said he raped her.\n\nIn recent months, Siebel, who runs the nonprofit Representation Project, which bills itself as ‘the leading gender watchdog organization,’ as well as other companies, has come under fire for raking in thousands of dollars in donations from corporations that lobby the state of California.\n\nIn light of all this, Newsom’s critics find his recent remarks about his hardscrabble life difficult to stomach.\n\n‘Politicians love the humble pie routine – to say they came up from nothing. But Gavin Newsom? He’s as connected as they come,’ Netter told the daily mail.\n\nDalton finds Newsom’s Proust-like memory of his mac-and-cheese days to be ‘pure comedy.’\n\n‘It was exactly like Hillary Clinton pulling out the bottle of hot sauce from her purse. It’s all wildly convenient and contrived – but the scariest part is it’s wildly effective.\n\n‘You know, I can say, the guy’s a sociopath, but then everyone on the left is like, ‘Yeah, but he’s got great hair,’ right? So it’s hard to combat.’\n\nActivist Denise Aguilar of the Freedom Angels group in California that fought vaccine laws and also worked for the 2020 recall of Newsom told the Daily Mail that Newsom is not fit to be president because she believes he is out of touch with the common man he describes himself as being.\n\n‘Newsom is out there on podcasts in his bid to be president and talking about growing up hustling and eating Wonder Bread, yet his actions as governor have forced Californians to hustle to put food on the table and pay the bills,’ Aguilar said.\n\n‘I find it interesting that Gavin Newsom says he understands the struggle to make ends meet, yet it’s his policies that are directly responsible for skyrocketing the cost of living that has Californians struggling every day to pay for food, gas, utilities, insurance and housing.\n\n‘Most people in California would tell you not to ever let Newsom California the nation.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nDubbed a &#8220;Nob Hill-billy elegy,&#8221; California Governor Gavin Newsom, often seen as&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Unveiling Gavin Newsom&#8217;s Hidden Past: The Untold Stories He Doesn&#8217;t Want You to Know first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/unveiling-gavin-newsoms-hidden-past-the-untold-stories-he-doesnt-want-you-to-know/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Gavin-Newsoms-secret-past-hes-so-desperate-to-hide.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-06 16:11:19","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.283},{"id":376521516,"title":"Kamala Harris says there’s enough room for everyone to be successful—and that professionals who think otherwise are guilty of ‘provincial thinking’","text":"“There are far too many people in this world and in professional life who approach things with a zero-sum game,” Harris said recently on The Diary of a CEO podcast. “If I have more, you have less. And it is incredibly shortsighted.” \n\nUnfortunately, she added, it’s the exact mindset that may have hurt her chances of becoming the chief of state. Harris had sensed for “quite some time” that White House staffers were stifling her career accomplishments while working alongside former U.S. president Joe Biden—downplaying the impressive track record that proved she had the chops for the job. A symptom of that same scarcity mindset.\n\nInstead of hyping up her career accomplishments, presidential employees shrouded them—and Harris felt it was an intentional choice to make sure she didn’t outshine Biden. But it may have backfired when she stepped up as the Democratic nominee in the 2024 presidential race against Donald Trump, which she recently spoke about at Fortune’s Most Powerful Women summit. \n\nLooking back now, the 61-year-old Democrat said that suppressing others’ success doesn’t protect your own—it just undermines the entire mission.\n\n“It’s actually quite provincial thinking when you’re talking about the stakes that were at play in our administration and, of course, in the election.”\n\nIt was ‘counterproductive’ to downplay Harris’ achievements\n\nHarris wasn’t blind to the way she was handled by presidential staffers—but she didn’t understand the full extent until after the election. \n\nStories spread, especially of how White House employees didn’t protect her against media attacks despite having the ability to do so. In her new book, 107 Days, Harris wrote that staff were “adding fuel” to negative narratives. In fact, she felt the president’s inner circle seemed “fine with it” and that she should be “knocked down” a bit more. \n\n“It was clear to me in terms of just the challenges with getting them to uplift, getting them to defend, especially when there were inaccurate, unfair attacks,” Harris said. “To the extent that the vice president is being attacked, resources were available but not used to defend the vice president in the way that they could have.”\n\nHarris drew the conclusion that staffers were holding her back in an effort to set Biden up to win his second election. But when he dropped out of the running just four months shy of the U.S. presidential voting day, Harris was rushed to pick up the pieces. She waged her campaign as the Democratic nominee, but lost out to sitting President Trump. The damage from Biden’s inner circle suppressing her achievements and letting negative narratives run wild was done.\n\nIn other words, success isn’t a limited resource—it’s a pie big enough for everyone to get a slice. Now, the Democratic Party has learned that lesson the hard way. “It was counterproductive,” Harris concluded. “We rose and fell together.” \n\nCEOs agree that it takes a village to be successful \n\nHarris isn’t the only leader who believes success should be shared, not sequestered to one person. In a visit to his alma mater, Google CEO Sundar Pichai explained his leadership philosophy: don’t focus on being the only winner, and uplift others around you.\n\n“As a leader, a lot of your job is to make [employees] successful,” Pichai said in 2022. “It’s less about trying to be successful [yourself], and more about making sure you have good people and your work is to remove that barrier, remove roadblocks for them so that they can be successful in what they do.”\n\nIndra Nooyi, former CEO of $200 billion giant PepsiCo, also relies on people as her superpower. She dispels the myth that leaders can reach new heights of success all by themselves—it takes a village to get there.\n\n“Looking at your people as assets, not tools for the trade, are going to be the only successful elements of the formula for the future,” Nooyi said on a podcast earlier this year with Northwestern’s Kellogg School of Management. “People are going to make you successful. You can’t do it all yourself.","summary":"Former U.S. VP Kamala Harris slams staff who “knocked down” her success: “It was counterproductive…We rose and fell together.”","url":"https://fortune.com/2025/11/06/former-vp-kamala-harris-enough-pie-everyone-slice-of-success-workers-guilty-provincial-thinking-career-setback-advice/","image":"https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2238216370-e1762445385858.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-06 16:11:12","author":"Emma Burleigh","authors":["Emma Burleigh"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.164},{"id":376444126,"title":"Gavin Newsom's secret past he's so desperate to hide... and the damning evidence that proves who he really is","text":"Call it Nob Hill-billy elegy.\n\nPresumed 2028 presidential candidate Gavin Newsom, Democratic governor of California and a card-carrying member of the San Francisco elite, has been channeling the ghost of Horatio Alger in a much-mocked attempt to portray himself as someone who made it out of a tough childhood.\n\nBut Newsom, 58, famously grew up surrounded by the most powerful families in California who not only backed his early business ventures but greased the wheels of his political ascent, sources have told the Daily Mail.\n\nEven his staunchest supporters admit that Newsom's early life was not exactly the stuff of deep struggle.\n\nBut that hasn't stopped Newsom from painting himself as a graduate of the school of hard knocks.\n\nDuring his October 25 appearance on the All The Smoke podcast, hosted by former NBA champions Matt Barnes and Stephen Jackson, Newsom described his upbringing as being 'about paying the bills, man… It was just, like, hustling.'\n\nAfter his parents divorced in the early 1970s, he was raised by his hard-working single mother - first in a San Francisco home now worth about $3.6million and later in equally affluent Marin County.

Neither party has figured us out","text":"On Tuesday, I voted for the first time. Not for a president, not in a midterm, but in the California special election to counter Texas Republicans’ gerrymandering efforts. What makes this dynamic particularly fascinating is that both parties are betting on the same demographic — Latino voters. For years, pundits assumed Latinos were a lock for Democrats. President Obama’s 44-point lead with these voters in 2012 cemented the narrative: “Shifting demographics” (shorthand for more nonwhite voters) would doom Republicans. But 2016, and especially the 2024 elections, shattered that idea. A year ago, Trump lost the Latino vote by just 3 points, down from 25 in 2020, according to Pew. Trump carried 14 of the 18 Texas counties within 20 miles of the border, a majority-Latino region. The shift was so significant that Texas Republicans, under Trump’s direction, are redrawing congressional districts to suppress Democratic representation, betting big that Republican gains made with Latinos can clinch the midterms in November 2026. To counter Republican gerrymanders in Texas, Gov. Gavin Newsom and California Democrats pushed their own redistricting plans, hoping to send more Democrats to the House. They too are banking on Latino support — but that’s not a sure bet. Imperial County offers a cautionary tale. This border district is 86% Latino, among the poorest in California, and has long been politically overlooked. It was considered reliably blue for decades; since 1994, it had backed every Democratic presidential candidate until 2024, when Trump narrowly won the district. Determined to understand the recent shift, during summer break I traveled in Imperial County, interviewing local officials in El Centro, Calexico and other towns. Their insights revealed that the 2024 results weren’t just about immigration or ideology; they were about leadership, values and, above all, economics. “It was crazy. It was a surprise,” Imperial County Registrar of Voters Linsey Dale told me. She pointed out that the assembly seat that represents much of Imperial County and part of Riverside County flipped to Republican. Several interviewees cited voters’ frustration with President Biden’s age and Kamala Harris’ lack of visibility. In a climate of nostalgia politics, many Latino voters apparently longed for what they saw as the relative stability of the pre-pandemic Trump years. Older Latinos, in particular, were attracted to the GOP’s rhetoric around family and tradition. But when asked about the top driver of votes, the deputy county executive officer, Rebecca Terrazas-Baxter, told me: “It wasn’t immigration. It was the economic hardship and inflation.” Republicans winning over voters on issues such as cost of living, particularly coming out of pandemic-era recession, makes sense, but I am skeptical of the notion that Latino voters are fully realigning themselves into a slate of conservative positions. Imperial voters consistently back progressive economic policies at the ballot box and hold a favorable view of local government programs that deliver tangible help such as homebuyer assistance, housing rehabilitation and expanded healthcare access. In the past, even when they have supported Democratic presidential candidates, they have voted for conservative ballot measures and Republican candidates down the ticket. Imperial voters backed Obama by a wide margin but also supported California’s Proposition 8, banning same-sex marriage. This mix of progressive economics and conservative values is why Republican political consultant Mike Madrid describes Latino partisanship as a “weak anchor.” The same fluidity explains why many Latinos who rallied behind Sen. Bernie Sanders in 2020 later voted for Trump in 2024. Both men ran as populists, promising to challenge the establishment and deliver economic revival. For Latinos, it wasn’t about left or right; it was about surviving. The lesson for both parties in California, Texas and everywhere is that no matter how lines are drawn, no district should be considered “safe” without serious engagement. It should go without saying, Latino voters are not a monolith. They split tickets and vote pragmatically based on lived economic realities. Latinos are the youngest and fastest-growing demographic in the U.S., with a median age of 30. Twenty-five percent of Gen Z Americans are Latino, myself among them. We are the most consequential swing voters of the next generation. As I assume many other young Latino voters do, I approached my first time at the ballot box with ambivalence. I’ve long awaited my turn to participate in the American democratic process, but I could never have expected that my first time would be to stop a plot to undermine it. And yet, I feel hope. The 2024 election made it clear to both parties that Latinos are not to be taken for granted. Latino voters are American democracy’s wild card — young, dynamic and fiercely pragmatic. They embody what democracy should be: fluid, responsive and rooted in lived experience. They don’t swear loyalty to red or blue; they back whoever they think will deliver. The fastest-growing voting bloc in America is up for grabs.

However, in this case, it’s not easy to separate the victory margins from the elephant in the room: President Donald Trump.\n\nNaturally, Trump tried, blaming the losses in part on the continuing government shutdown and on the fact that he was not on the ballot to bring in more voters for Republicans to win. Still, the exit polls contained some surprising information about people who went to the polls this year.\n\nIn both states, when asked who they voted for in the 2024 presidential election, 7% of voters who picked the Democratic gubernatorial candidate said they voted for Trump. It doesn’t sound like much, and given the victory margins, it wouldn’t have changed the results. Still, it’s not an insignificant number. It shows that some voters are not wedded to a particular party or even to a movement. (In 2021, Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R-VA) captured a smaller percentage of Biden voters, 5%, but given his narrower margin of victory, it was more significant to his win.)\n\nMore than two-thirds of voters in Virginia and New Jersey said they don’t identify as MAGA Republicans. Among them, 23–24% are Republicans who don’t see themselves as part of the MAGA coalition.\n\nIt’s easy (and somewhat lazy) to assume anyone who voted for Trump is a MAGA hat-wearing, right-wing extremist, and anyone who voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris is a “Fighting Oligarchy,” far-left, socialist progressive. Even the winners make such assumptions, but with far sunnier rhetoric about those who voted for them.\n\nThose assumptions give winners the permission structure to go full steam ahead with an agenda without any consideration that some of their voters might not support everything they do. Someone who voted for Trump because of inflation and higher prices may not sit there and enjoy watching the administration boast about Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids or sending illegal immigrants to countries not of their origin.\n\nThe more likely reason some Trump voters went for Democratic candidates boils down to the most basic issue voters think about when going to the polls: the state of the economy. Despite all of Trump’s bold promises, the economy has hardly improved from the time he began his second term. Voters are fickle, and we live in a culture of instant gratification. Trump promised to lower prices, but it didn’t happen. And some voters said, “Let me see what the Democrats can do in my state.”\n\nDEMOCRATS WIN BIG AND SMALL RACES IN THE 2025 ELECTION\n\nThis becomes a real concern in states such as Pennsylvania, Nevada, Wisconsin, and Michigan. These states tend not to be strongly linked to a particular party based on election results from 2016 to 2024. When parties push forward with an aggressive agenda without considering that some voters cast ballots for specific reasons, there is a substantial risk of a lurch in the opposite direction.\n\nIf Republicans and their strategists don’t examine the numbers to see that the Trump administration’s overall agenda turns people off, it could result in a slew of losses next November — no matter how states try to rearrange congressional districts.\n\nJay Caruso is a writer and communications professional living in West Virginia.","summary":"Republicans lost gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey on Tuesday.

She impeached him over nonsense … twice. She rigged the lawless January 6 Committee to get a specific outcome, one most voters found laughable, considering she was the one who (as then-Speaker) held the responsibility for protecting the U.S. Capitol Building and refused President Trump’s request for National Guard security.\n\nOne can only guess, but it seems hard to believe she didn’t play some role in the multiple indictments Trump faced in numerous states, all of which ended in disgrace.\n\nAll of this backfired spectacularly.\n\nMostly, though, Pelosi helped Trump win his historic second-term comeback in 2024 by backing Joe Biden and his disastrous policies, everything from open borders to appeasing Iran to vaccine mandates and all the terrible choices that led to record inflation. Worse still was her role in the cover-up of Biden’s cognitive decline and her immediate endorsement of Kamala Harris to take Biden’s place in the 2024 presidential election, which meant no primary for the so-called pro-democracy party.\n\nAbove all, Pelosi was so polarizing and divisive that throughout her role on the national stage after becoming House Speaker in 2007, she was not only one of the most consistently unpopular politicians in the country, but she also helped the GOP raise money like no one else.\n\nBye, Nancy.

She announced her retirement in a video posted on social media Thursday morning.“We have made history. We have made progress,” she said in the video. “And now, we must continue to do so by remaining full participants in our democracy and fighting for the American ideals we hold dear.”Her departure leaves a vacancy in a solidly Democratic San Francisco-based seat for the first time in nearly 40 years. More broadly, Pelosi’s retirement creates a hole in national Democratic leadership, underscoring questions about the future of a party that has struggled to find a winning message in the era of President Donald Trump. A fierce legislative tactician and prolific fundraiser, she was instrumental in securing signature policy achievements for Democratic presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, holding together a fractious caucus marked by tensions between progressives and centrists. This also made her a prime target for Republicans, who cast her as a villain in attack ads to motivate their voters.Several candidates had emerged to campaign for her seat before she announced her departure, including state senator Scott Wiener and progressive Saikat Chakrabarti. “Nancy Pelosi is an iconic, legendary, transformational figure, who has done so many things over so many years to make life better for so many people,” Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told reporters on Nov. 3.Among her biggest accomplishments as party leader was helping to enact Obama’s Affordable Care Act. She was also instrumental in passing the Dodd-Frank Act to put more guardrails on Wall Street after the 2008 financial crisis, as well as the economic stimulus package to help banks and others recover from the ensuing recession.Pelosi managed her fractious caucus to pass large parts of Biden’s economic agenda, including a bipartisan infrastructure bill and the Inflation Reduction Act, which created new renewable energy incentives and lowered prescription drug prices.Some of her most memorable moments emerged from spars with Trump. She oversaw two impeachments during his first term, and also grabbed headlines after ripping up a copy of the president’s State of the Union address while standing behind him on camera in 2020.

Nancy Pelosi, trailblazing Democratic leader from San Francisco, won't seek reelection","text":"Rep. Nancy Pelosi, a trailblazing San Francisco Democrat who leveraged decades of power in the U.S. House to become one of the most influential political leaders of her generation, will not run for reelection in 2026, she said Thursday. The former House speaker, 85, who has been in Congress since 1987 and oversaw both of President Trump's first-term impeachments, had been pushing off her 2026 decision until after Tuesday's vote on Proposition 50, a ballot measure she backed and helped bankroll to redraw California's congressional maps in her party's favor. With the measure's resounding passage, Pelosi said it was time to start clearing the path for another Democrat to represent San Francisco — one of the nation's most liberal bastions — in Congress, as some are already vying to do. \"With a grateful heart, I look forward to my final year of service as your proud representative,\" Pelosi said in a nearly six-minute video she posted online Thursday morning, in which she also recounted major achievements from her long career. Pelosi did not immediately endorse a would-be successor, but challenged her constituents to stay engaged. \"As we go forward, my message to the city I love is this: San Francisco, know your power,\" she said. \"We have made history, we have made progress, we have always led the way — and now we must continue to do so by remaining full participants in our democracy, and fighting for the American ideals we hold dear.\" Pelosi has not faced a serious challenge for her seat since President Reagan was in office, and has won recent elections by wide margins. Just a year ago, she won reelection with 81% of the vote. However, Pelosi was facing two hard-to-ignore challengers from her own party in next year's Democratic primary: state Sen. Scott Wiener (D-San Francisco), 55, a prolific and ambitious lawmaker with a strong base of support in the city, and Saikat Chakrabarti, 39, a Democratic political operative and tech millionaire who is infusing his campaign with personal cash. Their challenges come amid a shifting tide against gerontocracy in Democratic politics more broadly, as many in the party's base have increasingly questioned the ability of its longtime leaders — especially those in their 70s and 80s — to sustain an energetic and effective resistance to President Trump and his MAGA agenda. In announcing his candidacy for Pelosi's seat last month after years of deferring to her, Wiener said he simply couldn't wait any longer. \"The world is changing, the Democratic Party is changing, and it's time,\" he said. Chakrabarti — who helped Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) topple another older Democratic incumbent with a message of generational change in 2018 — said voters in San Francisco \"need a whole different approach\" to governing after years of longtime party leaders failing to deliver. While anticipated by many, Pelosi's decision nonetheless promised to reverberate through political circles, including as yet another major sign that a new political era is dawning for the political left — as also evidenced by the stunning rise of Zohran Mamdani, the 34-year-old democratic socialist elected Tuesday as New York City's next mayor. Known as a relentless and savvy party tactician, Pelosi had fought off concerns about her age in the past, including when she chose to run again last year. The first woman ever elected speaker in 2007, Pelosi has long cultivated and maintained a spry image belying her age by walking the halls of Congress in signature four-inch stilettos, and by keeping up a rigorous schedule of flying between work in Washington and constituent events in her home district. However, that veneer has worn down in recent years, including when she broke her hip during a fall in Europe in December. That occurred just after fellow octogenarian President Biden sparked intense speculation about his age and cognitive abilities with his disastrous debate performance against Trump in June of last year. The performance led to Biden being pushed to drop out of the race — in part by Pelosi — and to Vice President Kamala Harris moving to the top of the ticket and losing badly to Trump in November. Democrats have also watched other older liberal leaders age and die in power in recent years, including the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the late Sen. Dianne Feinstein, another San Francisco power player in Washington. When Ginsburg died in office at 87, it handed Trump a third Supreme Court appointment. When Feinstein died in office ill at 90, it was amid swirling questions about her competency to serve. By bowing out of the 2026 race, Pelosi — who stepped down from party leadership in 2022 — diminished her own potential for an ungraceful last chapter in office. But she did not concede that her current effectiveness has diminished one bit. Pelosi was one of the most vocal and early proponents of Proposition 50, which amends the state constitution to give state Democrats the power through 2030 to redraw California's congressional districts in their favor. The measure was in response to Republicans in red states such as Texas redrawing maps in their favor, at Trump's direction. Pelosi championed it as critical to preserving Democrats' chances of winning back the House next year and checking Trump through the second half of his second term, something she and others suggested will be vital for the survival of American democracy. On Tuesday, California voters resoundingly approved Proposition 50. In her video, Pelosi noted a litany of accomplishments during her time in office, crediting them not to herself but to her constituents, to labor groups, to nonprofits and private entrepreneurs, to the city's vibrant diversity and flair for innovation. She noted bringing federal resources to the city to recover after the Loma Prieta earthquake, and San Francisco's leading role in tackling the devastating HIV/AIDS crisis through partnerships with University of California San Francisco and San Francisco General, which \"pioneered comprehensive community based care, prevention and research\" still used today. She mentioned passing the Ryan White CARE Act and the Affordable Care Act, building out various San Francisco and California public transportation systems, building affordable housing and protecting the environment — all using federal dollars her position helped her to secure. \"It seems prophetic now that the slogan of my very first campaign in 1987 was, 'A voice that will be heard,' and it was you who made those words come true. It was the faith that you had placed in me, and the latitude that you have given me, that enabled me to shatter the marble ceiling and be the first woman Speaker of the House, whose voice would certainly be heard,\" Pelosi said. \"It was an historic moment for our country, and it was momentous for our community — empowering me to bring home billions of dollars for our city and our state.\"","summary":"Rep.

Last year, it was a conveyor belt of Democrats.\n\nIt aired puffball interviews with Pete Buttigieg, Doug Emhoff, Nancy Pelosi, Joe Biden, Ketanji Brown Jackson, and Kamala Harris. So, it was typical when CBS reporter Seth Doane traveled to Italy for this week’s show to get the hot interview with “Hollywood icon” George Clooney.\n\nThings got spicy when they discussed what went wrong in 2024. Doane asked Clooney if he still felt good about his New York Times op-ed calling for Biden to step aside.\n\n“Yes. We had a chance,” Clooney answered. “I wanted there to be—as I wrote in the op-ed—a primary. Let’s battle-test this quickly and get it up and going. I think the mistake with it being Kamala is that she had to run against her own record. And it’s very hard to do if the point of running is to say, ‘I’m not that person.’ You know, it’s hard to do. And so, she was given a very tough task. I think it was a mistake, quite honestly.”\n\nSo, Clooney wanted a primary, which obviously did not happen. It could have happened if Democrats had pressured Biden out in 2023, but they denied and delayed until the disastrous debate, and then it was too late for a primary. It left them with the irony of being the Democrats without any actual democracy.\n\nThen Doane asked Clooney, “Did you see Hunter Biden’s reaction?”\n\nHunter Biden was naturally furious that his income source was forced out. “I love George Clooney’s movies, but I don’t really give a s— what he thinks about who should be the nominee for the Democratic Party,” he told one podcaster. He also claimed Barack Obama gave Clooney “the blessing” to speak out, and said, “F— him! F— him and f— everybody around him.”\n\nClooney said yes, he saw that, but who needs a family feud? “I could spend a lot of time debunking many of the things he said, because many of the things he said were just outright lies. You know, Obama didn’t put me up to it. It wasn’t my fundraiser.”\n\nHe’s going to be the bigger man, he told CBS. “But the reality is, I don’t think looking backwards like that is helpful to anyone, particularly to him. I don’t think it’s helpful for the Democratic Party. And so, I’m just going to wish him well on his ongoing recovery, and I hope he does well, and just leave it at that. I have many personal opinions about it, but I don’t find it to be helpful to have a public spat with him.”\n\nThe pro-Democrat networks never want a “public spat” between Democrats. It killed them to spend a few weeks as the party elites forced the feeble elder Biden out.\n\nBut there’s a dirty little secret about this interview: None of this political section of the interview was aired nationwide on CBS. You’d have to find it online. They can’t talk about a “public spat” in front of the public.\n\nInstead, CBS plugged the “highlights” of the interview at the top of the show as Doane oozed, “It’s hard to beat a tour of Venice with George Clooney. He talks fame, relationships, and aging.”\n\nClooney mused, “I watch what I eat. But, you know, everything in moderation, including moderation.”\n\nThis kind of partisan editing is exactly what the Democrat enablers inside CBS News want to preserve and protect under Bari Weiss and their new ownership.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2025 CREATORS.COM\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

Just an absolute ass-kicking by Trump and the Republicans in last year's election. He mopped the floor with Kamala. It was a bloodbath from the start of the day to the end of the night, to the next morning. Hell, he was still widening his lead DAYS later as votes kept coming in. Popular vote. Electoral vote.

The results come amid renewed debate within both parties over how to win back young men, a group increasingly seen as pivotal to future national elections.\n\nWhat To Know\n\nThe 2024 election saw young men shift toward President Donald Trump, with the GOP becoming the preferred party among the demographic.\n\nAccording to AP VoteCast, 53 percent of men aged 18—44 backed him, up from 45 percent in 2020, when Joe Biden carried the group with 52 percent.\n\nThe narrow youth margins in the 2024 election sparked anxiety within the Democratic Party that it was losing touch with younger voters, particularly young men.\n\nOn an episode of his podcast in May, Newsom said Democrats had to “get out of our own damn bubble” and examine the social and economic forces that paved Trump’s path back to the White House in November.\n\nSplit image of JD Vance, left, and Gavin Newsom (AP).\n\n“I just think we need to really have a deep introspection, and we need to own up to what has happened over the last few elections, not just this election,” he said. “I think we’ve got to square with our agenda and where the American people are.” \n\nSince then, Newsom has sought to improve his party’s image with young men, launching a podcast where he has interviewed leading MAGA figures like the late Charlie Kirk and Steve Bannon.\n\nHe has also publicly criticized his party on some issues. In his conversation with conservative commentator Kirk, Newsom criticized how the Democratic Party has handled debates over transgender rights. When asked about a transgender high school athlete’s recent victory in a girls’ track event, Newsom said the situation raised “an issue of fairness,” adding that Democrats “have to own that” and “acknowledge it.” He said the party was being politically “crushed” on transgender issues.\n\nNewsom pointed to Trump’s 2024 campaign as an example, noting that it effectively used the issue to attack Democratic candidate Kamala Harris. He described one Trump campaign ad—which stated, “Kamala’s for They/Them. President Trump is for You”—as “a great ad,” but “devastating” for Democrats. He added that Harris’ lack of response made the problem worse.\n\nMeanwhile, Newsom has launched a barrage of sharp attacks on Trump on social media since August, with the governor’s office transforming its presence into a barrage of all-caps taunts, pop culture spoofs, and AI-generated memes—mocking the president’s style.\n\nAnd polls suggest Newsom’s approach may be paying off. He has received a significant bump in the polls in recent months. However, not all surveys have been good news for Newsom. A Noble Predictive Insights poll, conducted between October 2-6, showed that among Democrats and independents, Newsom is trailing former Vice President Harris for the 2028 nomination, after leading her in August.\n\nNonetheless, some election results suggest young men are moving back toward the Democratic Party. CNN exit polls showed men aged 18-29 opting for the Democratic ticket in Virginia, New Jersey, and New York in Tuesday’s elections, and supporting Proposition 50 on redistricting in California.\n\nIn Virginia, CNN exit polls show Democratic gubernatorial candidate Abigail Spanberger winning 57 percent of men aged 18 to 29, her strongest support among any male age group. That number fell to 52 percent among men aged 30 to 44 and 42 percent among those 65 and older.\n\nIn New Jersey, 56 percent of young men backed Democrat Mikie Sherrill, compared to 44 percent for Republican Jack Ciattarelli. Support among men peaked at 61 percent for those aged 30 to 44 before declining sharply with age.\n\nIn New York City’s mayoral election, Democrat Zohran Mamdani captured 68 percent of young men, far ahead of independent Andrew Cuomo’s 26 percent and Republican Curtis Sliwa’s 5 percent.\n\nCalifornia showed a similar pattern, with 74 percent of men aged 18 to 29 voting yes on Proposition 50, while 26 percent voted no.\n\nWill JD Vance and Gavin Newsom Run In 2028?\n\nNeither Vance nor Newsom have declared their candidacy for 2028, but both have hinted they will run. In April, Vance said during a Fox & Friends appearance that he would consider making a pitch for the White House. “When we get to that point, I’ll talk to the president. We’ll figure out what we want to do.

Some of those states are also expected to be key House battlegrounds in 2026. \n\nThe early and battleground state count excludes if the state is their home state and does not count multiple visits by the same candidate.\n\n\"Anybody who's looking at the 2028 cycle is starting to head out on the road … Putting an emphasis on states that could determine control of the House is your best bet, and probably should be your only focus between now and the midterms,” Sawyer Hackett, a veteran Democratic strategist who worked on presidential campaigns for Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Julian Castro, told ABC News.\n\n2025 election states: New Jersey, Virginia, California, New York City\n\nIn New Jersey, Democratic candidate and U.S. Rep. Mikie Sherrill received support on the trail from a crowd of presidential hopefuls, including former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, Arizona Sen. Ruben Gallego, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, California Rep. Ro Khanna, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. \n\nAnd in Virginia, Democratic candidate and former U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger had the support of Beshear, Buttigieg, Emanuel, Gallego, Kelly, Khanna, Moore, Shapiro, and Whitmer. \n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom, former Vice President Kamala Harris, and Klobuchar separately stumped for \"Proposition 50\" in California, while Khanna and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez stumped for Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani in New York City.\n\nKey early states: Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina\n\nSome of the presidential hopefuls have flocked to states with early nominating contests. The Democratic Party is currently reevaluating its calendar for when those early contests will occur, but Hackett said Democrats hoping to run are still covering their bases.\n\nIowa, which usually boasts first-in-the-nation caucuses, will host a closely watched Senate race next year. The state also has some competitive House seats.\n\nIowa hosted former Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz in March and Buttigieg for a town hall in May, while Gallego visited in August and Emanuel came by in September. Kelly is set to visit in November, while Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen spoke to Iowa Democrats in September.\n\nNew Hampshire, which holds the nation’s first presidential primaries and will hold a contested U.S. Senate race in 2026 for the seat being vacated by Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, has hosted several lawmakers. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear visited earlier this month; Gallego and Khanna stopped by in August; Klobuchar was there in July and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker will visit in November. \n\nWhen Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker visited in April, he painted a dire picture for his party.\n\n\"Fellow Democrats, for far too long, we've been guilty of listening to a bunch of do-nothing political types who would tell you that America's house is not on fire, even as the flames were licking their faces,\" Pritzker said.\n\nSouth Carolina, meanwhile, also has an early presidential primary. This year, it saw visits from Beshear, Khanna and Newsom in July -- who told rural residents \"what we're experiencing is America in reverse.\"\n\nKelly visited in September, while Maryland Gov. Wes Moore and Walz visited in late May for South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn's \"Fish Fry\" event, which has often been fertile waters for would-be Pennsylvania Avenue hopefuls.\n\nBoth Walz and Moore have told ABC News previously they are not \"running\" for president or have no plans to run.\n\nBattleground states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin\n\nSeveral 2028 presidential hopefuls have also made their way around the seven battleground states, which have been considered winnable by either party and have an outsized influence on where campaigns place their resources.\n\nA few potential candidates have or plan to pay visits to Arizona, including Ocasio-Cortez, who visited in March as part of the Fighting Oligarchy tour run by independent Sen. Bernie Sanders. Whitmer visited in March, while Booker visited in April and Buttigieg visited in October. Harris, who recently said she’ll \"possibly\" run for president again, will be speaking there in April 2026.\n\nArizona has two congressional seats currently held by Republicans viewed as competitive, according to the Cook Political Report. \n\nGeorgia is often the site of both a close presidential race and critical down-ballot races. Khanna visited in August, while Harris made a stop there on her book tour in October.\n\nFurther north, Moore and Khanna have paid visits this year to the battleground state of Michigan, where both President Donald Trump and Democratic Senate candidate Elissa Slotkin won in 2024.\n\nWisconsin, which had the closest margin between Trump and Harris in 2024 of the battleground states, saw visits from Klobuchar in March, Khanna in May, Walz in March and September and Whitmer in October.\n\nNevada, which also often figures early in the presidential primary calendar, saw visits this year from Ocasio-Cortez in March, Pritzker and Khanna in August, and Gallego and Kelly in September. \n\nNorth Carolina saw visits from Pritzker in July and Buttigieg in September. Harris visited for her book tour there in October, while fellow Californian Khanna will drop by in November.\n\nPennsylvania is also a key battleground state. Moore delivered a commencement address at Lincoln University in Gettysburg in May, the same month Gallego and Khanna paid their own visits. Notably, two Republicans in Pennsylvania, Reps. Scott Perry and Ryan Mackenzie, are expecting to face fierce fights to hold onto their seats. \n\nKhanna recently said the party's focus is to win back control of the House, which has a Republican majority.\n\n\"We have already a number of great candidates for 2028 that’ll emerge, but right now the focus has to be to take back the House in terms of political priority,\" Khanna told public media organization WHYY.","summary":"ABC News has tracked at least 43 visits or planned visits so far in 2025 and 2026 by Democratic presidential hopefuls to key early or battleground states.","url":"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/2028-presidential-hopefuls-flock-key-battleground-states-traveled/story?id=126909684","image":"https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/f1653a9e-befd-4985-90f2-804409c99c26/FourWayCA_v01_KA_1761601908507_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-06 11:19:27","author":"Oren Oppenheim","authors":["Oren Oppenheim"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.035},{"id":376363488,"title":"Brownstein: Election Day sent an unmistakable warning to Republicans","text":"With resounding wins in Tuesday’s Virginia and New Jersey gubernatorial races, Democrats substantially repaired the most important cracks that President Donald Trump made in their coalition in the 2024 election. That gives Democrats reason for optimism — though not yet certainty — that they are on track for a solid recovery in the 2026 midterm election.\n\nDemocrats Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey and Abigail Spanberger in Virginia regained significant ground among two groups where Trump made noteworthy advances last year: working-class people of color and young people, according to both media exit polls and county-by-county election results. The two Democrats also improved among college-educated voters, essentially matching the party’s 2024 showing with White voters and improving among non-White voters with a four-year degree, according to the Voter Poll conducted by SRSS for a consortium of media organizations. All those groups also provided huge margins for Proposition 50, the redistricting ballot initiative backed by Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom, which passed convincingly in California.\n\nEven the most optimistic Democrats don’t contend that Tuesday’s results prove the party has solved its problems with those voting blocs. Since the 1970s, New Jersey and Virginia have almost always elected governors from the party that lost the presidential race the previous year. And Trump’s 2024 gains among blue-collar minority voters were concentrated among irregular voters who are the least likely to show up for an odd-year election.\n\nUndurable realignment\n\nBut the Democratic wins do signal that exuberant Republican predictions after 2024 — that Trump had engineered a durable realignment, particularly among working-class Hispanic, Black and Asian American voters — were premature. Instead, Tuesday’s results signal that many voters in all the constituencies that moved toward Trump in 2024 remain within reach for both parties. Moreover, the same economic frustrations that boosted Trump among those groups last year are buffeting him, and other Republicans, now.\n\nThe convincing Democratic wins reinforced the core truth that attitudes about the incumbent president are now the driving force in off-year elections. Analysts in both parties have wondered for months whether the public dissatisfaction with Democrats that is evident in poll after poll might offset the mounting doubts about Trump’s performance. On Tuesday, the answer was clear: In the Voter Poll, more voters in both New Jersey and Virginia expressed a negative view than a positive view of the Democratic Party, even as they convincingly elected Democrats. Voters’ discontent with the incumbent president clearly outweighed their doubts about the party out of the White House — continuing a pattern that has become consistent (though rarely discussed) in off-year elections.\n\nIn Tuesday’s major contests, Republicans lost ground with each group where Trump established a key beachhead last year. In Virginia, the shift was most visible in the four big, well-educated and racially diverse suburban counties outside Washington (Fairfax, Arlington, Prince William and Loudoun). The Democratic margin in those counties had sagged in 2021, when Republican Glenn Youngkin won the governor’s race, and in 2024, when Kamala Harris eked out a surprisingly narrow win. Spanberger far exceeded the Democrats’ vote share in either of those elections across all four counties. (Almost unimaginably, Spanberger won those counties by an even larger combined vote total than Harris did in 2024, when far more people voted statewide.) Compared to 2024, Democrats also rebuilt their margins in such heavily Black Virginia communities as Petersburg, Portsmouth and Norfolk, and exit polls showed Spanberger holding Republican nominee Winsome Earle-Sears to 34% of Hispanic voters, well below the 40% Trump carried there last year.\n\nIn New Jersey, Republican Jack Ciattarelli, who narrowly lost the governorship in 2021, saw several of the New Jersey counties with the highest share of college graduates — including Monmouth, Morris, Somerset and especially Bergen — tilt back toward the Democrats, compared to Trump’s performance in 2024. Even more important, Sherrill rebuilt the Democratic margins compared to 2024 in counties with large Hispanic and/or Black populations, including Camden, Middlesex, Mercer (Trenton), Hudson (Jersey City) and Essex (Newark). Big gains among Hispanics allowed Trump in 2024 to become the first GOP presidential nominee in the 21st century to carry Passaic County. Sherrill was winning 55% there with about three-fourths of the vote counted. In the Voter Poll, only 32% of Hispanics supported Ciattarelli, way down from Trump’s 43% in 2024.\n\nWhither White voters?\n\nAnd in both states, Democrats ran much better than Harris among all non-White voters without a college degree — the group whose movement toward Trump was Exhibit A in the putative GOP case for realignment.\n\nFor Democrats, the most reassuring aspect of Tuesday’s results may have been Trump’s role in the outcome. Spanberger and Sherrill both bound Earle-Sears and Ciattarelli tightly to Trump, insisting that each would place fealty to the president over loyalty to the state. (The Republican candidates helped this charge stick, refusing to criticize Trump even for actions that directly hurt their states, such as the federal government layoffs in Virginia or the cancellation of federal funding for a major transit tunnel in New Jersey.) In California, supporters of Proposition 50 portrayed the measure, above all, as an opportunity to push back against the president. Jay Jones, the Democratic Attorney General candidate in Virginia, who was facing a ferocious scandal over deeply offensive texts fantasizing about political violence, recovered enough to win by centering his campaign on promises to fight Trump in court.\n\nThose arguments helped Democrats surf a backlash against Trump across these blue-leaning states. In both Virginia and New Jersey, about 55% of voters said they disapproved of Trump’s job performance as president, and over 9-in-10 of those disapprovers voted Democratic in the governor’s race, according to the Voter Poll. (Even the scandal-scarred Jones carried 87% of voters who disapproved of Trump.) In California, 64% disapproved and over 9-in-10 of them supported Proposition 50. Zohran Mamdani, too, relied almost entirely on voters who disapproved of Trump in his comfortable win in the New York City mayoral race.\n\nThose results closely tracked the trend in in off-year elections over roughly the past 15 years, when around 85% to 90% of people who disapproved of the incumbent president have usually voted for the other party’s candidates in House, Senate and gubernatorial elections, according to exit polls and other Election Day surveys. (In Virginia, for instance, Democrat Ralph Northam won 87% of those who disapproved of Trump when he captured the governorship in 2017, while Youngkin carried 90% of those who disapproved of President Joe Biden when he flipped the office in 2021.)\n\nTuesday’s outcome suggests that despite the public’s clear concerns about Democrats, attitudes about Trump will likely remain the most important factor in next year’s midterm election. That will help Republicans in reliably red states where Trump is popular. But it also means the GOP will face a tough environment everywhere else — unless Trump can rebuild his approval rating, which has skidded to the lowest point of his second term on persistent frustration over prices and growing concern about his deportation agenda and threats to democratic safeguards.\n\nTrump’s grip on the GOP is so tight that these sweeping Democratic wins aren’t likely to stir much questioning within his party. But the recoil from Trump’s belligerent second term was forceful on Tuesday — and not only among partisan Democrats, but among many swing voters. The results sent Republicans an unmistakable warning signal about 2026, whether or not they are willing to listen.\n\nRonald Brownstein is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering politics and policy. ©2025 Bloomberg.
