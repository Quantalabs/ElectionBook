I would do anything for him. He would do anything for our kids. \nShe added: 'We really did commit to wanting our children to be as unscathed by the divorce as possible.'\nNow that both of their kids are in college and they are officially empty nesters, Gwyneth decided to sell the home the kids grew up in.\nThe Talented Mr. Ripley star, 52, originally put her lavish 8,000 sq. home up for sale for $29.99 million, before lowering the price to $24.9 million last October.\n\nPaltrow captioned this photo on her Instagram Best Apple's birthday/Mother's Day EVER at the @museumoficecream \n\n She then cut the price again, and the home officially sold for $22 million, as per The Wall Street Journal.\nThe actress purchased the home with Martin in 2012 for $9.95 million. \nApple is currently a junior at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee.

Despite earlier reports suggesting she would attend, the former Veep has decided to stay home. The change of plans was confirmed by her husband, ex-Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff. Sources indicate the decision was made earlier in the day, citing a variety of reasons. While AMPAS did not respond to requests for comment, an Academy insider told Deadline that rumours of Harris' attendance were “not true.” The Oscars, hosted by Conan O’Brien, are expected to see heightened security this year.

A convoy of black mini-buses were also brought in additional private security, while K-9 units carefully screened all vehicles. The 2025 Oscar race is intense with Emilia Pérez, a bold musical about a drug kingpin undergoing gender-affirming surgery, leading the nominations with 13 nods, including Best Picture. Close behind are The Brutalist, a historical epic exploring the Jewish immigrant experience, and Wicked, the Broadway sensation turned film, both securing 10 nominations. Guy Pearce, star of The Brutalist and Best Supporting Actor nominee, made a powerful statement on the red carpet by wearing a dove-shaped pin in support of Free Palestine. This is the first protest pin to be seen at this year’s Oscars.

Goldberg confirmed that she has seen a finished script for the long-awaited sequel and is hopeful it will come to fruition this year. “We’re hoping it’ll happen sometime this year,” Goldberg told Variety during an interview at the Oscars red carpet in Hollywood on Sunday. When asked for her thoughts on the script, Goldberg was quick to emphasize, “It doesn’t matter what I think. It only matters if Disney wants to do it.” Also Read: Oscars 2025 LIVE Updates Goldberg first starred in Sister Act back in 1992, a film that grossed $231 million on a $31 million budget. She returned for the sequel, Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit, playing her iconic role as a former lounge singer in witness protection who hides out in a California convent. Following the success of the first two films, speculation about a third installment has been ongoing. In 2020, Variety reported that Goldberg was officially onboard for the threequel, with Tyler Perry producing. However, following the death of Maggie Smith last September, Goldberg acknowledged that the project will need to undergo some changes. “We’re having to make some readjustments [to Sister Act 3] because we just lost Maggie Smith, as you know. And so, we will get it done. We will get it done. It’s a shift,” she said. Before her Oscar win for Ghost, Goldberg received her first nomination for The Color Purple in 1986. At this year’s ceremony, she is expected to pay tribute to the beloved classic alongside Oprah Winfrey. Goldberg also holds the distinction of being the only Black woman to host the Oscars solo, having done so four times over the years. Meanwhile, it was reported that Vice President Kamala Harris will not be among them. Despite earlier reports suggesting she would attend, the former Veep has decided to stay home. The change of plans was confirmed by her husband, ex-Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff.

Even in her 90s, she spoke out against police brutality and for adequate health care in underserved neighborhoods, the NAACP’s New York State chapter said in a statement.\n\nIn 2023, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton presented Dukes with the NAACP’s highest honor — the Spingarn Medal.\n\n“I’m not tired yet,” Dukes said in her acceptance speech for the award. She added that she would continue her advocacy and empower the next generation of NAACP leaders.\n\nDukes helped lay the foundation for Black women to ascend to the nation’s highest offices. In 1972, she took the stage at the Democratic National Convention to second the presidential candidacy of Shirley Chisholm, the first Black woman to run for the party’s nomination.\n\nDukes was instrumental in former President Joe Biden’s decision to choose a Black woman as his 2020 running mate, she noted in an interview with CBS last year. Her career-long fight was bookended by former Vice President Kamala Harris’ 2024 bid for the presidency.\n\nIn a post in X Saturday, Harris called Dukes one of the heroes “upon whose broad shoulders we stand.”\n\n“I’m just proud of Kamala. I’m just excited if I can live to see this happen. It would be the joy of my life,” Dukes said in the CBS interview.\n\nDukes was the president of her own consulting firm. She also served as the member of the NAACP National Board of Directors. Leaders of the NAACP said in a statement Saturday that Dukes was a “living embodiment” of the NAACP and that her legacy has touched every aspect of the movement.\n\nNew York City Mayor Eric Adams ordered flags to be lowered at half-staff as a tribute to Dukes.","summary":"Dukes led the New York State NAACP for nearly five decades.","url":"https://www.syracuse.com/us-news/2025/03/hazel-dukes-lifelong-new-york-civil-rights-advocate-and-naacp-leader-dies-at-92.html","image":"https://www.syracuse.com/resizer/v2/6XR7VSJYFFEYNFSTJ7KVZCWTXA.jpg?auth=2c8f9846ee631b318adc06be3ba5cf886934199b534cad9e76e0bae07d4a62b9&width=1280&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-03 00:18:33","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.335},{"id":296015002,"title":"Raye is the epitome of glamour in a sweeping red gown as she arrives at the Oscars 2025 - after skipping the BRIT Awards","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nMonday, Mar 3rd 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOscars viewers lose their minds over tiny detail on Ariana Grande's dress during emotional opening performance with Cynthia Erivo\n\nVolodymyr Zelensky says he's 'ready to sign' minerals deal with the US and insists he 'just wanted Ukrainian position to be heard' during disastrous Oval Office meeting with Trump\n\nEurope must do the 'heavy lifting' on Ukraine, says Starmer as he gathers 'coalition of the willing' European leaders and vows to give Trump a peace plan - amid fears US will abandon the continent\n\nI'm making 10 per cent a year... on a type of ISA that almost everyone else has forgotten about: Here's how YOU can get double digit returns too\n\nThe dangers in your daily cup of matcha tea or coffee: Influencers claim it lowers anxiety and blood pressure, but mounting evidence suggests it can also trigger a dangerous health condition...\n\nYoung woman diagnosed with rare and aggressive form of breast cancer...weeks later, her sister got shocking news\n\nTruth behind Jade Thirlwall's 'music manager husband' revealed after they turned heads on the BRITs red carpet - and he looks very different in real life!\n\nHollywood plastic surgeons spill on new Ozempic hack A-listers used for speedy Oscars makeovers... and why 'you'll be shocked' to discover who's doing it!\n\nThe 'far too cheap' UK shares ripe for takeovers: Ten bargain stocks - including household names\n\nKamala Harris silences rumors she's star guest at the Oscars as husband Doug shares behind scenes look at their watch party\n\nTrump fuels rumors White House takedown of Zelensky was a 'setup' by promoting elaborate theory from karate dojo instructor\n\nWhy Taylor Swift could now be 'the smoking gun' in Blake Lively-Justin Baldoni legal battle: Insider reveals new twist in It Ends With Us saga\n\nI lost 21 pounds of 'wine weight' and DIDN'T have to go teetotal: Here's how I did it\n\nRevealed: The five clues that an afterlife really DOES exist\n\nHackman's final years: A philanthropist who went e-biking, dined at a simple roadside grill, piloted airplanes and still rented DVDs long after streaming took over Hollywood\n\nBillie Eilish pals around with a pretty blonde woman in a Sydney park a year after coming out as queer\n\nOscars 2025 Worst Dressed: Ariana Grande leads list with puffy gown as Wicked costar channels Dracula\n\nDEAR JANE: My doctor friend says my new favorite kink is DANGEROUS.

The epic historical drama follows his character László Tóth's attempts to realize his creative vision even as it conflicts with the petty desires of his wealthy benefactor (Pearce).\n\nShe accessorised perfectly with Lorraine Schwartz jewelry and wore her dark tresses in a perfect bouncy blow dry\n\nRaye opted for a glowing makeup look and put on an animated display as she hit the star-studded red carpet\n\nThe star missed the BRIT Awards in London on Saturday night - where she was awarded the Best R&B Act gong - in order to be at the Oscars in LA\n\nThe 97th Academy Awards are honoring the best films of 2024, with the star-studded ceremony being held at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood\nWicked tied it for 10 nominations, including for best picture, actress (for Cynthia Erivo), and supporting actress (for Ariana Grande).\nThe blockbuster musical is an adaptation of only the first half of the musical of the same name, a reimagined prequel to The Wizard Of Oz starring Erivo as Elphaba, future Wicked Witch of the West, and Grande as Galinda Upland, who becomes Glinda the Good \nOther best pictures nominees include Anora, A Complete Unknown, Conclave, Dune: Part Two, I'm Still Here, Nickel Boys and The Substance. \nThe closely watched race for best actor in a leading role got a major shakeup just a week before the Oscars at the Screen Actors Guild Awards, when Timothée Chalamet scored a shock win for his Bob Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown. \n\n Oscars 2025: Wicked star Cynthia Erivo shocks in bold look as Felicity Jones and Raye lead the British glamour on the red carpet \nPrior to that win, Brody was seemingly the favorite after winning best actor awards at the New York Film Critics Circle Awards, the BAFTAs, the Golden Globes and the Critics Choice Movie Awards.\nRalph Fiennes has also doggedly stayed in the running for his role as a British Cardinal struggling to keep a secretive papal election from dissolving into competition and intrigue. \nThe critically acclaimed film has scored multiple actor wins at smaller ceremonies and festivals for Fiennes, as well as multiple awards for the entire acting ensemble, which Fiennes has accepted on more than one occasion. \nThose three co-frontrunners are competing against Colman Domingo for Sing Sing and Sebastian Stan for his performance as a young Donald Trump in The Apprentice.\nThe best actress category also has no clear frontrunner. Demi Moore has been lauded for her comeback performance in the satirical body-horror film The Substance, which earned her best actress honors from the Critics Choice Awards and the Golden Globes, as well as several critics' organizations. \nBut her win a week before the Oscars at the SAG Awards suggests she may be in a prime spot to snatch the Oscar after being nominated for the first time. \nAnora star Mikey Madison, who plays an adult dancer who impetuously marries the son of a Russian Oligarch, was widely acclaimed and was honored by several critics' organizations early in the season. \nHer chances increased significantly after she won the BAFTA for best lead actress, which she followed up with an Independent Spirit Award win in the gender-neutral lead performance category. \nEmilia Pérez star Karla Sofía Gascón was once a favorite for the award, but she was widely criticized after racist and Islamophobic tweets — some quite recent — that had somehow gone unremarked upon were translated into English and reported on.\nSince then, Gascón has sat out awards ceremonies after her posts came to light. After multiple half-hearted apologies, Netflix reportedly opted to stop paying for Gascón's travel and accommodations for awards shows, though a source told People that she still plans to attend the Oscars.\nBefore the controversy, her nomination was seen as historic, as she is the first openly transgender woman to be nominated in the best actress category. \nThe other nominees are Wicked star Cynthia Erivo, who has failed to capture any major awards, and the Brazilian actress Fernanda Torres, who stars in the historical drama I'm Still Here. She had her own controversy after a clip of her appearing in blackface in a comedy sketch from a Brazilian TV series 17 years ago resurfaced in January.\nIn the supporting actress category, the nominees including Monica Barbaro for A Complete Unknown, Ariana Grande for Wicked, Felicity Jones for The Brutalist, Isabella Rossellini for Conclave and Zoe Saldaña for Emilia Pérez \nSaldaña appears to be the current favorite after a string of wins at the Golden Globes, BAFTA Awards, SAG Awards and Critics Choice Awards.\nBut some of those early awards had voting periods that cut off prior to the controversy around Gascón surfacing, which could potentially harm her chances from voters who were turned off of Emilia Pérez altogether.\nThe supporting actor category seems the easiest to predict, Kieran Culkin's string of wins for A Real Pain making him the favorite. \nThe other nominees include Yura Borisov for Anora, Edward Norton for A Complete Unknown, Guy Pearce for The Brutalist and Jeremy Strong for The Apprentice. \n\nRaye accepted her BRIT award via video call on Saturday night as she was already in LA for the Oscars \nAmong the best picture nominees, Emilia Pérez once seemed like the most likely winner, but Gascon's offensive posts have threatened its chances.\nThe Palme d'Or–winning Anora got a late boost with wins for best picture at the Directors Guild of America Awards and the Producers Guild of America Awards, which are considered two of the best predictors of Oscars success by awards-season prognosticators, and its win at the Independent Spirit Awards didn't hurt.\nThe best director category seems likely to be a three-man race between Anora's Sean Baker, The Brutalist director Brady Corbet and Emilia Pérez's Jacques Audiard. \nThis year's original song category features two cutes from Emilia Pérez, El Mal and Mi Camino, the new Elton John song Never Too Late, from the documentary of the same name about him, Like a Bird from Sing Sing, and the latest Diane Warren effort The Journey.\nThe Academy Awards begin at 7 p.m. ET/4 p.m. PT and can be watched on ABC and, for the first time, on a streaming service, Hulu.\nSubscribers to premium services including Hulu + Live TV, YouTube TV, AT&T TV and FuboTV can also also catch the ceremony live. \n\nOscar nominations 2025 -

Here's the viral video: Catie Upton received a lot of public criticism for her answer during the Miss Teen USA 2007, and, in a 2015 interview with New York Magazine, she revealed that the widespread backlash led to a period of severe depression and suicidal thoughts. As for Karoline Leavitt, she has gained notoriety after taking over as the White House Press Secretary under President Donald Trump.

Leavitt attended Saint Anselm College. During her college days, she became interested in politics and interned as a writer in the White House Office of Presidential Correspondence during Trump's first term.

It's OK to not know why someone might need a surrogate to have a child. It's OK to not know the motivations of a surrogate regardless of what you assume.\n'And it's OK to spend less time spewing hateful words into the world, especially in regards to a beautiful baby girl who has brought a lot of love into people's lives.

The New York Times has heard from nearly 100 companies that import from China about how the president's tariffs were affecting them. They are a cross-section of striving enterprises stitched into the global economy: companies that make greeting cards, board games, outdoor footwear, hangers, digital picture frames, coffee equipment, toys, stained-glass windows and custom electronics. By Daisuke Wakabayashi, Alexandra Stevenson, Danielle Kaye and Eli Tan.\n\nWith photos.\n\n[Story first moved Saturday, March 1, at 2:07 p.m. ET.]\n\nTop display:\n\nQUITTING-SHOPPING (Undated) -- A growing group of shoppers are fed up with a constant barrage of marketing in their social feeds and phone alerts. Many have taken to TikTok to declare that they are participating in \"Low Buy 2025\" or \"No Buy 2025\" and sharing the ways they are curbing their spending. The videos have garnered millions of views since the start of the year. The zeal that is driving this trend is as much a pushback against the forces of a consumerist culture as it is about saving money, with scorn for corporate manipulation mixed in with tips for changing personal habits.

The department closed applications to the repayment plans after the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld and expanded a temporary suspension of the Saving on a Valuable Education plan, known as SAVE. Here's what we know now. By Tara Siegel Bernard.\n\nWith photo.\n\n[Story first moved Friday, Feb. 28, at 4:44 p.m. ET.]\n\nBottom right:\n\nU.S.-FOREIGN-INVESTMENT (Undated) -- At the U.S. Agency for International Development, thousands of workers have been fired or put on administrative leave, and many of its projects have been halted. Now, a former Goldman Sachs analyst and son of a private equity billionaire has ambitions to control some of USAID's roughly $40 billion budget and apply more of a \"pro-market\" approach to supporting development in other countries. Benjamin Black, 40, has been nominated by President Donald Trump to run the U.S. International Development Finance Corp., a little-known agency that invests and lends billions each year to companies and projects overseas. By Matthew Goldstein and Maureen Farrell.\n\n[Story first moved Wednesday, Feb. 26, at 3:02 p.m. ET.]\n\nBottom left:\n\nU.S.-BROADCASTER-INQUIRIES (Undated) -- Voice of America, the federally funded broadcaster to the world, has long prided itself on serving as an accurate and fair source of news and on being independent of whichever president and party are in power in the United States. Since the election of President Donald Trump, that independence is increasingly being tested. By David Enrich and Minho Kim.\n\nWith photos.

Doris, 67, investigated local government, digging into city affairs in West Palm Beach, Florida, over two decades at the paper, most recently as editorial page editor. He didn't expect his career there to end over a cartoon. Gannett, the largest newspaper company in the United States and the owner of The Palm Beach Post, fired Doris last month after he decided to publish a cartoon about the war in the Gaza Strip, Doris said. By Benjamin Mullin.\n\nWith photo.\n\nAIRLINE-LOYALTY-PROGRAMS (Undated) -- These days, airlines are happy to shower you with sign-up bonuses and juicy earning multipliers to get you to spend on their credit cards. It's supposed to be a mutually beneficial relationship: You get award travel, and the airlines get record profits. Delta Air Lines, for example, earned nearly $2 billion from its American Express partnership in just the last three months of 2024 -- up 14% from the previous year. The problem, though, is that the points and miles you earn are buying less travel than they used to. By Ryan Craggs.\n\nWith illustration.\n\n[Story will move in the \"t\" news file.]\n\nPARAMOUNT-DEAL (Undated) -- Shari Redstone, the controlling shareholder of the entertainment giant Paramount, delivered a crucial message to her board a few weeks ago. For months, Paramount's lawyers had been jousting with representatives for President Donald Trump, who had sued the company's CBS News network over its segment on former Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump accused the network of deceptively editing the interview; CBS said Trump's lawsuit was without merit. But when the board gathered recently, Redstone was clear: She was in favor of resolving the issue, two people familiar with the matter said. By Benjamin Mullin and Lauren Hirsch.\n\nWith photo.\n\n[Story first moved Friday, Feb. 28, at 4:23 p.m. ET.]\n\nSOCIAL-SECURITY-WORKERS (Undated) -- President Donald Trump's escalating initiative to drastically cut the federal workforce has reached the Social Security Administration, a crucial program that keeps millions of older Americans out of poverty, which said Friday that it would reduce its head count by more than 12%. The Social Security Administration, which sends about 73 million retired and disabled beneficiaries more than $126 billion each month, said it had plans to cut roughly 7,000 workers from its 57,000-member workforce. The agency will also shutter six regional offices. By Tara Siegel Bernard.\n\nWith photo.\n\n[Story first moved Friday, Feb. 28, at 7:43 p.m. ET.]\n\nIMMIG-GOLD-CARD (Undated) -- President Donald Trump's plan to sell green cards for $5 million each, a program he is calling a \"gold card,\" has largely been met with a shrug. It's not clear exactly how the program would work, if it's legal or how many potential immigrants would really pay $5 million for a path to U.S. citizenship. But in a niche area of deal-making, alarm bells are blaring.

While AMPAS did not respond earlier Sunday to request for comment from Deadline on Harris’ attendance at the Conan O’Brien hosted ceremony, an Academy source did tell us “not true” about the VP coming.\n\nPREVIOUSLY, 12:45 PM: No word if Kamala Harris is presenting or not, but there’s a very good chance the former Vice President will be attending the 97th Academy Awards today.\n\nThe anticipated arrival by the 2024 Democratic candidate for the White House comes as security in and around the Dolby Theatre is at an all-time high with a modern-day Praetorian Guard of LAPD, federal law enforcement and more shutting down Hollywood. “All vehicles have to let the dogs in,” one officer was heard saying on a gated and blockaded Hollywood Blvd this morning as a convoy of black mini-buses brought in more private security and others with the K-9 units sniffing them all down.\n\n“We live in a new evolving security environment,” a federal official told Deadline Sunday as Black tie staff with walkie-talkies and cops surrounded the tented red carpet entrance to the Dolby. “The expected attendance of the former vice president is a major factor in the added security,” another law enforcement officer went on to say.\n\nRepresentatives of AMPAS did not respond to request for comment on Harris coming to the ABC broadcasted 4 p.m. PT/7 p.m. ET Academy Awards today. However, an Academy source poured ice cold water on Harris showing, up. “Not true,” they said.\n\nVP or not, the protective Tinseltown dome around the Dolby was greater than ever this year.\n\nThis year, at the last minute, Oscar credentialing required even more clearance for red carpet reporters and crew: Green lanyards. In addition to photograph badges for the media, all reporters were pre-screened by the police in advance, the AMPAS press office required the wearing of green lanyards. Said one industry source, “That’s dinosaur stuff. AI knows where you are nowadays. They’re probably ten years behind the technology in the world today.”\n\nUnusually, the LAPD had no comment on security measure for the event.\n\nThe post will be updated if either AMPAS or the LAPD do have an official statement. Worth noting, unlike past Oscars, the LAPD did not send out a street closure advisory in the weeks leading up to today’s ceremony.\n\nOther officials noted that there was some flux if the ex-VP and her husband Doug Emhoff would be in the Dolby for sure with the overheated political climate.\n\n“There are no credible threats,” the federal official Deadline spoke to said.\n\nThe rain that was predicted to fall on the Oscars never arrived Sunday, but Hollywood Blvd is gated on both sides from Cahuenga Boulevard on the East and Le Brea on the West with crossing cut off as of Wilcox. Bomb squads are on site and there is zero access to Highland, though the red carpet can plainly be seen from about a block away. Streets going North and South off Hollywood Blvd are also blocked, with “Road Closed” barrier and police on Highland from Sunset up. Highland down from Franklin is blocked until 4 a.m. Monday morning, the cops say.\n\nThe ex-VP’s anticipated stint at tonight’s Oscars isn’t her first appearance on the Awards circuit this season. Receiving the Chairman’s Award, Harris was at the NAACP Image Awards on February 22. Without naming her 2024 rival Donald Trump, the now LA resident warned the star studded crowd of “shadows gathering over our democracy.” \n\nAs in past years, Harris has also been active on the party circuit too this weekend.\n\nThe former Veep was at CAA boss Bryan Lourd‘s private Oscar soiree on March 1 with a packed crowd of fellow A-listers, I’m told. Staying mum so far on her post-DC plans, former California Attorney General and Senator, Harris joined Joe Biden signing with CAA last month.\n\nAs for the security around the Oscars, a lot of it is out of site as usual, but still at a heightened level.\n\nSaid Kent Moyer, CEO and Founder of The World Protection Group on the great number of cops on the street as Harris rolls into town, “They’re moving out the outer ring of protection” He added: “Basically, law enforcement wants to show force, and act as a deterrent: You can’t get near the place because it’s fortified. The whole profile looks better.” \n\nIn regard to drone protection, which is become an absolute necessary at awards ceremonies and major entertainment functions throughout the city, Moyer says, “It’s a perfect day for drones because there’s no rain. If you’re not using a drone at an event like this, you’re leaving out an element of protection, which is the fourth ring of protection in the sky. There’s going to be a great number of people at the Oscars. If law enforcement is trying to get to a crime, that drone is the fastest response.”\n\nAny protests nearing the Hollywood ovation area have to be cleared with the LAPD in advance. The question is how big the turnout is, and whether that stalls attendees from getting into the Dolby Theatre and Hollywood and Highland complex, as it has in recent years. Law enforcement sources tell us no protests are expected today. They do cautioned that pro-Ukraine demonstrators could still show up, as they have around LA since the February 28 blow-up in the Oval Office between the seemingly pro-Russia Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky \n\nWith or without protesters or former VPs, the The 97th annual Oscars airs on ABC Sunday, March 2 starting at 4 p.m. PT/7 p.m. ET. For the first time, the ceremony will also be streaming live on Hulu.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nUPDATE: The stars will be out today at the Oscars, but Kamala&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Update: Kamala Harris Cancels Plans to Attend Oscars Due to Hollywood Security Lockdown first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/update-kamala-harris-cancels-plans-to-attend-oscars-due-to-hollywood-security-lockdown/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/rewrite-this-title-Kamala-Harris-Now-Not-Attending-Oscars-Amidst.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-02 23:27:52","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.024},{"id":296015000,"title":"Paris Jackson poses with godfather Macaulay Culkin proving they are still close 16 years after Michael Jackson's death","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nMonday, Mar 3rd 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOscars viewers lose their minds over tiny detail on Ariana Grande's dress during emotional opening performance with Cynthia Erivo\n\nVolodymyr Zelensky says he's 'ready to sign' minerals deal with the US and insists he 'just wanted Ukrainian position to be heard' during disastrous Oval Office meeting with Trump\n\nEurope must do the 'heavy lifting' on Ukraine, says Starmer as he gathers 'coalition of the willing' European leaders and vows to give Trump a peace plan - amid fears US will abandon the continent\n\nI'm making 10 per cent a year... on a type of ISA that almost everyone else has forgotten about: Here's how YOU can get double digit returns too\n\nThe dangers in your daily cup of matcha tea or coffee: Influencers claim it lowers anxiety and blood pressure, but mounting evidence suggests it can also trigger a dangerous health condition...\n\nYoung woman diagnosed with rare and aggressive form of breast cancer...weeks later, her sister got shocking news\n\nTruth behind Jade Thirlwall's 'music manager husband' revealed after they turned heads on the BRITs red carpet - and he looks very different in real life!\n\nHollywood plastic surgeons spill on new Ozempic hack A-listers used for speedy Oscars makeovers... and why 'you'll be shocked' to discover who's doing it!\n\nThe 'far too cheap' UK shares ripe for takeovers: Ten bargain stocks - including household names\n\nKamala Harris silences rumors she's star guest at the Oscars as husband Doug shares behind scenes look at their watch party\n\nTrump fuels rumors White House takedown of Zelensky was a 'setup' by promoting elaborate theory from karate dojo instructor\n\nWhy Taylor Swift could now be 'the smoking gun' in Blake Lively-Justin Baldoni legal battle: Insider reveals new twist in It Ends With Us saga\n\nI lost 21 pounds of 'wine weight' and DIDN'T have to go teetotal: Here's how I did it\n\nRevealed: The five clues that an afterlife really DOES exist\n\nHackman's final years: A philanthropist who went e-biking, dined at a simple roadside grill, piloted airplanes and still rented DVDs long after streaming took over Hollywood\n\nBillie Eilish pals around with a pretty blonde woman in a Sydney park a year after coming out as queer\n\nOscars 2025 Worst Dressed: Ariana Grande leads list with puffy gown as Wicked costar channels Dracula\n\nDEAR JANE: My doctor friend says my new favorite kink is DANGEROUS.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy BRIAN MARKS FOR DAILYMAIL.COM \n Published:23:09 GMT, 2 March 2025 |Updated:23:18 GMT, 2 March 2025 \n\nConan O'Brien will forever be able to look back on the day he met his wife — because it was all caught on camera.\nBut the 61-year-old comedian, the host of the 97th Academy Awards this evening, has so far refused to ever rewatch the footage.\nO'Brien — who helped to roll out the red carpet for the Oscars on Wednesday in Hollywood — has been married to his wife Elizabeth 'Liza' Powel O'Brien since 2002, after the lovebirds met two years earlier.\nAt the time that he and Powel met, Conan was still hosting his iconic talk show Late Night With Conan O’Brien.\nThat meant nothing to his future wife, though, as she wasn't a viewer and wasn't familiar with his reputation as an in-demand comedian and a writer for some of the The Simpsons' most acclaimed episodes.\nBut fate brought the two together when Liza was featured in a sketch that her future husband recorded for his NBC talk show, which meant that their meet-cute was immortalized on tape.\n\nConan O'Brien, who hosts the 2025 Academy Awards tonight, and his wife Liza Powel O'Brien had a meet-cute on his talk show Late Night in 2000; pictured Sunday at the Oscars in Hollywood\n\nTheir first time laying eyes on each other was captured on tape for Conan's show, but Liza revealed Conan has never rewatched the tape, even though she has many times; seen in 2016 in Beverly Hills\n\n The happy couple are pictured on their wedding day in Seattle in 2002\n\nIn January 2000, Liza was employed at the advertising agency Foote, Cone & Belding, the talk show host later recalled to Michelle Obama on The Light Podcast.\nThe producers for Late Night had contracted the agency for help with a sketch Conan was planning in which he would air a parody of a commercial for Hilton Furniture, which had sold ads to air during his time slot in the local Houston, Texas, market.\nThe commercials were practically a parody from the start, as they featured the store's owner, Hilton Koch, waving a chainsaw and cutting off part of a bedpost with it while urging customers to visit the store.\n\n Oscars host Conan O'Brien unveils red carpet for 'most unpredictable' race in years \nBecause of the advertising agency's connection, the comic visited their offices to shoot part of the sketch, in which they invited the Hilton to film a new ad.\nLiza was featured early in the sketch when Conan visited the office and chatted with members of the creative team about how the agency worked.\nLater, she popped up again in a conference room as she introduced the ad that the agency had come up with to Conan. \n'We end up talking in the lobby, and she said everything a woman is not supposed to say, leading off with, \"Yeah, I saw my gynecologist recently, and my gynecologist said I need to start having children in the next two to three years, if I really want them to be healthy,\"' Conan recalled while chatting with Michelle Obama.\n'And me, rather than be panicked, I’m thinking, \"Yes, you should have children. Your children should be my children,\"' he continued.\n\nO'Brien, 61, reported for duty on Wednesday as he helped to roll out the red carpet ahead of Sunday's 97th Academy Awards ceremony at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood\n\nConan filmed a comedy segment at the ad agency where Liza used to work, but he fell for her instantly after chatting with her; seen in 2019 in LA\nLiza told the story in her own way in 2022 on the Inside Conan podcast, which is hosted by the Conan's writers Mike Sweeney and Jessie Gaskell and is part of his network of podcasts.\nAt the time, she revealed that she had watched the clip, which is easily accessible on YouTube, several times over the years.\nBut that wasn't the case for her husband.\n\n Oscar committee members so appalled by woke nominees they're abstaining from voting \n'He won’t watch it,' she declared, before revealing that reason Conan has steered clear of rewatching the meet-cute because he's too attached the the idealized version in his mind.\n'He wants to remember it instead...' she explained. 'He says he prefers his memory to whatever the truth is.'\nConan and Liza's connection was so strong that they were soon dating, and they walked down the aisle in January 2022 in a ceremony held in her hometown of Seattle.\nThey made sure to pay tribute to the unusual way that they met, with Liza revealing on Inside Conan that they 'invited Hilton to the wedding.' \nThe happy couple didn't waste any time on starting the family they'd wanted since they first met. \n\nThe couple, who married less than two years later, entwined their careers. In addition to working as a playwright, Liza hosts a history podcast for Conan's podcast empire; pictured on Late Night with Conan O'Brien\n\nIn October 2003, they welcomed their daughter Neve (seated next to Conan), now 21, and their son Beckett (seated next to Liza), now 19, followed in November 2005; pictured in 2016 in LA\nIn October 2003, they welcomed their daughter Neve, now 21, and their son Beckett, now 19, followed in November 2005. \nIn 2024, Liza recalled Conan's metaphor for how children test the strength of their marriage while chatting with Jameela Jamil on her I Weigh podcast.\n'When they’re producing cars on the assembly line, there’s a machine that takes every, whatever, 200th car and picks it up and shakes it to see if anything comes loose,' she recalled, via the Today Show. 'It’s sort of a way they quality test their product. So that’s what having kids does to your to your relationship. It just picks the whole thing up and shakes it, and it’s rattling and s*** is falling off. \n\n Conan O'Brien talks hosting 2025 Oscars amid the 'traumatic' LA fires \n'And it is incredibly stressful — stressful in so many ways that you can see coming and in ways that you can’t see coming,' she shared.\nSince getting married, Liza has been an integral part of her husband comedy empire. She hosts and writes the Team Coco podcast Significant Others, a comic history podcast that highlights lesser-known figures who had important connections to major movers and shakers.\nConan gushed about his wife's podcast shortly after its release on his own podcast, Conan O'Brien Needs A Friend. 'I really love it,' he enthused. 'And I’m excited about it and very proud, as your goofy partner in life, that you have made this really cool podcast that we’re going to share with people.'\nLiza has proven herself to be a multi-talented figure, and in addition to working as an ad executive and hosting a history podcast, she has established herself as a playwright. \nAmong her full-length plays are Lucky, which received a Zoom reading as part of Echoe Theatre LabFest 2022 amid the coronavirus pandemic; Apostrophe, which was workshopped at the Ojai Playwrights Conference FOUNDRY project in 2020 and produced at the Whidbey Island Center for the Arts in 2022; and The Great Experiment, which received a workshop production at Los Angeles' Geffen Playhouse in 2019.\n\nOscar nominees 2025 full list - see who received nods for this year's Academy Awards\n\n Best Picture\n\nThe Brutalist \nA Complete Unknown \n\nDune: Part Two \nEmilia Pérez \nI’m Still Here \nNickel Boys \nThe Substance \n\nEmilia Pérez leads this year's Oscar nominees with 13, including for best picture, actress, supporting actress and director\n\nBest Director \nJacques Audiard — Emilia Pérez\nSean Baker — Anora\nBrady Corbet — The Brutalist\nCoralie Fargeat — The Substance\nJames Mangold — A Complete Unknown\n\nActress in a Leading Role\nCynthia Erivo — Wicked \nKarla Sofía Gascón — Emilia Pérez\nMikey Madison — Anora \nDemi Moore — The Substance \nFernanda Torres — I’m Still Here \n\nThe Substance has been nominated for numerous Oscars, including Best Actress for Demi Moore \n\nActor in a Leading Role\nAdrien Brody — The Brutalist \nTimothée Chalamet — A Complete Unknown \nColman Domingo — Sing Sing \nRalph Fiennes — Conclave \nSebastian Stan — The Apprentice\n\nThe Brutalist came in second place with 10 nods, including for best picture, actor (Adrien Brody), supporting actor (Guy Peare) and supporting actress (Felicity Jones)\n\nActress in a Supporting Role\nMonica Barbaro — A Complete Unknown \nAriana Grande — Wicked \nFelicity Jones — The Brutalist \nIsabella Rossellini — Conclave \nZoe Saldaña — Emilia Pérez \n\nActor in a Supporting Role\nYura Borisov — Anora \nKieran Culkin — A Real Pain \nEdward Norton — A Complete Unknown \nGuy Pearce — The Brutalist \nJeremy Strong — The Apprentice \n\nAnimated Feature Film\n\nInside Out 2\nMemoir of a Snail \nWallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl\nThe Wild Robot\n\nCinematography\nThe Brutalist — Lol Crawley\nDune: Part Two — Greig Fraser\nEmilia Pérez — Paul Guilhaume \nMaria — Ed Lachman \nNosferatu — Jarin Blaschke\n\nOriginal Screenplay\nAnora — Sean Baker\nThe Brutalist — Brady Corbet & Mona Fastvold \nA Real Pain — Jesse Eisenberg\nSeptember 5 — Moritz Binder, Tim Fehlbaum;

speak plainly and directly.”\n\n“Own the failures of Democratic governance in large cities and commit to improving local government.”\n\nConcerns about the left flank of the party damaging the party’s image and brand loomed large among the centrist Dems.\n\n“In the wake of this election, where it became so evident that the things that the left was doing and saying deeply hurt [former Vice President Kamala] Harris and down-ballot Democrats, a lot of people are looking to us, not just Third Way, but the moderates in the party, and saying, ‘We got to do it your way, because the other way ain’t working,’ ” Third Way public-affairs exec Matt Bennett told Politico, which first reported the memo.\n\nOrganizers of the event made clear that not everyone who attended the retreat agreed on all of the takeaways in the memo.\n\nTension has long simmered between elements of the party’s progressive base who want Democrats to lurch further to the left and centrists who believe that push has given fodder to Republicans.\n\nBroadly speaking, during the second Trump administration for example, some Democrats seem to prefer the party focusing heavily on kitchen-table issues such as inflation and carefully picking fights with the president, while others want to see a much more forceful repudiation of Republicans.\n\nBut one thing both factions appear to agree on is that the Democrats’ messaging strategy has generally been far less effective than the Republicans’ approach over recent years.\n\nThe summary paper called for a comprehensive study to figure out a better way of reaching voters and for pols to go into “unfriendly” media spaces.\n\nA key glimmer of hope for Democrats in Congress has been some of the protests at GOP-run town hall events, mirroring similar clashes that took place before a midterm election wave, as was the case in the 2010 and 2018 election cycles.","summary":"\"Activist groups and progressive staffers push unpopular cultural positions, making it seem like Democrats are more extreme than they actually are,\" said a summary paper from the retreat and seen by The Post.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/03/02/us-news/moderate-dems-hatch-comeback-plan-that-distances-party-from-far-left-embraces-patriotism/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/99586921.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/KzNr34mE-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-03-02 23:18:08","author":"Ryan King","authors":["Ryan King"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.165},{"id":296005954,"title":"Oscars Security Nightmare Sparks Rumors of Kamala Harris Appearance","text":"Scouted selects products independently.

Unlike most external vibrators, the Legato is a ring vibrator engineered to stimulate the vulva—not just the clitoris. This is an ideal sex toy for those seeking a penetration-free external vibrator that doesn’t just offer direct clitoral stimulation. \n\nCreated by leading OB-GYNS and urologists, the beginner-friendly Legato is made of waterproof silicone, allowing the vibrator to bend and adapt to all vulva shapes and sizes. Its four strategically placed motors deliver mind-blowing pleasure to the entire vulva while enhancing natural lubrication. \n\nPlus, thanks to the flexible ring design, the Legato also excels at solo and partnered play. The wide circular gap in the middle allows a partner (or another sex toy) to penetrate. In fact, male partners may even reap the benefits of extra stimulation in certain positions like missionary. \n\nBut the fun for couples doesn’t end there. By using the companion app, you or your partner can play with 16 vibration intensity settings. So, whether you’re edging toward an explosive orgasm or craving pulsations and deep rumbles, the power is in your hands (literally). Best of all? Right now, the Legato is a whopping 35 percent off.","summary":"Paras Griffin/Getty Images for BETFormer Vice President Kamala Harris is widely expected to make an surprise Academy Awards cameo as the ceremony turns up its security detail in preparation. Deadline reported that the losing 2024 presidential candidate will probably be at the event, although there was no indication of whether she would be presenting or not. The trade publication wrote that security around the Dolby Theatre was unusually high, effectively “shutting down” Hollywood. “We live in a new evolving security environment,” a federal official told Deadline on Sunday, right before the Oscars. “The expected attendance of the former vice president is a major factor in the added security,” another law enforcement officer told the publication.

You were gentle and kind and loving, quiet and unassuming, but so powerful, and your presence was felt the minute you walked into any room. You never demanded the spotlight. You never needed to make a sound to be recognized, your heart and your talent did that as effortlessly as you artistry did. I've been having trouble putting the words together the last few days. The truth is I'm still in shock that such a beautiful young life has come to an end. It seems senseless and unfair.\n'I know your family is brokenhearted as am I and everyone else who knew you. Your spirit moved on to the next phase beyond this life but I know wherever you are there is beauty and light. And the beauty and light you left here will live on forever. Rest in peace, sweet angel… [broken heart emoji] (sic)'\nJesus worked with a host of big-name stars during his career, including Jennifer, Kylie Jenner, Kendall Jenner, Kim Kardashian, Charli XCX, Camila Cabello, and Dua Lipa.\nScott Barnes, Jennifer's make-up artist, has also taken to social media to pay tribute to the celebrity hairstylist.\nAlongside a tribute video, Scott wrote Instagram: 'I can't believe I was just working with him in Dubai and now he's gone.

According to reports, the politician will be attending the event but it is unknown if she is set to present an Academy Award . However her attendance is said to have caused chaos with security concerns. The Oscars are set to honour the hardworking firefighters and workers who battled the wildfires that destroyed Los Angeles homes earlier this year. Harris, who was previously a Democrat senator for California, could be leading the event’s segment on the devastating fires. The Mirror reports that according to locals, Hollywood’s Dolby Theatre’s security has been tightened and vehicles wanting to get through security need to let sniffer dogs inside. It has been reported a large number of black minibuses transporting a security team was seen entering the compound. One federal official working the glitzy annual told Deadline: “We live in a new evolving security environment. The expected attendance of the former vice president is a major factor in the added security.” Meanwhile, executive producer and showrunner Raj Kapoor told the Associated Press (AP) has teased that there will be heartfelt moments throughout the show. Teasing that fans can enjoy the ceremony even if they haven’t seen all of the films nominated, Raj said: “If you love the movies, like come to the Oscars and maybe you’ll discover things that you actually have not seen yet but will want to. Hopefully you’ll fall in love even with a few pictures while watching the show.” Meanwhile, executive producer Katy Mullan added: “We’ve got some reunions that I think will hit people in the heart.” Last year, it was announced that Conan O’Brien would be fronting the awards for the first time. Academy CEO Bill Kramer and Academy president Janet Yang said they felt “thrilled and honoured” that the “incomparable” O’Brien had accepted the role. Yang said Conan is the “perfect” choice because of his “brilliant humour, his love of movies, his live TV expertise, and remarkable ability to connect with audiences”. The academy hoped Conan will draw viewers in to “honour the spectacular films and filmmakers of this year”. Talk show host O’Brien is replacing Jimmy Kimmel, who has hosted for the past two years.

Though it has not yet been confirmed if the Democrat would attend the event, but certain reports claimed citing the unusually tight security around the Dolby Theatre, the venue of the event, was because Harris would be in attendance for the event. Amid the high security around the Dolby Theatre, which included the deployment of LAPD and federal law enforcement, Deadline cited a federal official to report that the Vice President could attend the event. However, neither the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences nor Harris' representatives have confirmed her attendance. “All vehicles have to let the dogs in. We live in a new evolving security environment,” a federal official was heard saying by the reporter. “The expected attendance of the former vice president is a major factor in the added security,” the officer added.

Lateefah Simon, a longtime friend and mentee of former Vice President Kamala Harris, to deliver its response to President Donald Trump's address to Congress on Tuesday. \"I’m honored to speak on behalf of the Working Families Party,\" Simon said in a statement last week. \"We need a government that is run by and for working people, not billionaires—and that’s what the WFP is fighting for. When I see what’s happening in our country right now, it’s essential that we—as Members of Congress—are showing up for our communities and reminding people that it doesn’t have to be this way.\" The Working Families Party, which is a small left-wing political party, has featured Rep. Ayanna Pressley, former Rep. Jamaal Bowman, and Rep. Rashida Tlaib to deliver its response to a president's joint address to Congress in previous years. CONGRESSIONAL PROGRESSIVE CAUCUS PAC BACKS CANDIDATE WHO SIGNED 'BLACK NEW DEAL' DEMANDING REPARATIONS Simon is a freshman congresswoman representing California who has shared a long friendship with former 2024 Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris. She spoke to NPR ahead of the November election last year, detailing that she and Harris first met back in the early 2000s when Harris worked in the San Francisco City Attorney’s office. \"I really believed in her. The young women that I worked with believed in her. But never in a million years did I think that I would work for her,\" Simon told NPR back in August. 'I LOVE YOU': LONGTIME HARRIS ALLY HAS BEEN FRIENDS WITH CCP GROUP'S TOP EXEC FOR OVER A DECADE She recounted that Harris had encouraged her to earn a college degree, asked her to join her team when she was San Francisco district attorney, given her career advice, and even officiated at her wedding ceremony. Simon recalled that when Harris offered her a job in the DA's office, she said: \"You can either carry this bullhorn on your back for the rest of your life, demanding that elected officials work for you and the young people that you care about, or you can become a part of my team, and we can actually deconstruct some of these inequities.\" Simon went on to cement her status as a social justice advocate in California across the years, including amid the defund-the-police movement of 2020. While serving as board president for the Bay Area Rapid Transit system in 2020, she advocated for \"defunding and abolishing\" policing standards on public transportation in favor of unarmed ambassadors. Fox News Digital also previously reported that Simon has had a more than decade-long friendship with a top executive of a Chinese Communist Party (CCP) front group, including heaping praise on the executive on X. Simon won her election to serve as California's 12th congressional district representative in November, taking the reins from former Democratic Rep. Barbara Lee, and has since been identified as a \"rising star\" in the Democratic Party by liberal media outlets. Harris officiated Simon's congressional swearing-in ceremony in January, when Simon lauded her \"mentor\" as a pivotal influence in her career. UNEARTHED REPORT REVEALS POWERFUL HARRIS ALLY 'WILLING TO SHARE' RESOURCES FROM BLACK BUSINESSES WITH CCP \"I am so honored to have my mentor and former boss, Vice President Kamala Harris,\" Simon said on January 7. \"Since our time together in the district attorney’s office in San Francisco, the vice president has played an integral role in shaping my public service career, and I have learned so much from her. \"She has also paved the way for women across the nation like me who aspire to serve their country at the highest levels. It was a special moment to stand with her today, look her in the eye and begin my journey as the Congresswoman for California’s 12th District.\" Trump is set to address Congress at 9 p.m. ET on Tuesday, his first joint address since returning to the Oval Office in January. The speech – which is not officially called a \"State of the Union\" speech as Trump has not been in office for the last year – comes just days after a fiery meeting between Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy amid the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine.

big at UK pop music's special night","text":"Pop sensation Charli XCX turned the Brit Awards into the brat awards on Saturday as she claimed five gongs at the annual celebration of UK music.\n\nFresh from winning three Grammys, the 32-year-old behind the cultural movement \"brat summer\" won Album Of The Year, the evening's most coveted gong, at the 45th annual awards ceremony in London's O2 Arena.\n\n\"Brat\", the artist's sixth album and launched in June with its lime-green cover and celebration of a relaxed, partying lifestyle, transformed her into one of the top music stars in 2024.\n\nIt redefined the word \"brat\", which even became associated with Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris when fans began applying the colored \"brat\" filter to the nominee's images.\n\n\"I am living proof that you don't need to compromise,\" she said on picking up the award.\n\nThe album beat off competition from veteran band The Cure, seven-time Brit winner Dua Lipa, jazz group Ezra Collective and indie-rockers The Last Dinner Party.\n\nCharli XCX -- full name Charlotte Aitchison -- also won song of the year for \"Guess\", featuring Billie Eilish, and thanked the US singer for the collaboration.\n\n\"I'm really happy a song about underwear now has a Brit Award,\" she joked.\n\nHer other two awards on the night were for best artist and best dance act, adding to the best songwriter prize she was awarded on Wednesday.\n\nHowever, she asked not to perform as she did not want the \"added pressure\", but laughed at her table when host Jack Whitehall suggested it was because she wanted to get drunk.\n\nU.S. star Sabrina Carpenter kicked off the show, which featured a tribute to late One Direction star Liam Payne, with a performance of her global hit \"Espresso\", flanked by dancers dressed as British soldiers in bearskin-style hats.\n\nCarpenter was presented with The BRITs Global Success award, following an introduction by Motown legend Diana Ross, in recognition of her mammoth sales in 2024.\n\nOther acts to play live included US rapper Teddy Swims and indie singer Sam Fender, who won the best alternative act award.\n\nEzra Collective claimed the best group award, while The Last Dinner Party won best new artist.\n\nCarpenter lost out on the International Artist Of The Year Award, which boasted a shortlist including Taylor Swift, Billie Eilish, Beyonce and Kendrick Lamar, to U.S. singer/songwriter Chappell Roan, who also won international song of the year.\n\nThe Brit Awards have recognised the cream of British pop music since they were first held in 1977, but have often been peppered with scandal and farce.\n\nThe 1989 Brits are best remembered for the shambolic presenting skills of model Samantha Fox and Fleetwood Mac's Mick Fleetwood and a comical series of mishaps.\n\nPulp frontman Jarvis Cocker stormed the stage in protest while Michael Jackson performed surrounded by children in 1996.\n\nAnd Madonna suffered whiplash injuries at the 2015 edition when she fell off the stage wearing a giant cape and surrounded by dancers wearing bondage-style costumes and horns on their heads.\n\nAfter years of chart success by stars such as Ed Sheeran and Adele, British music artists failed to make it into the worldwide annual charts of the year's top 10 bestselling singles and albums in 2024 -- the first time this has happened in more than 20 years.","summary":"Pop sensation Charli XCX turned the Brit Awards into the brat awards on Saturday as she claimed five gongs at the annual celebration of UK

Inroads Now Fears ICE Raids","text":"NEW YORK -- The taco joint just around the corner from Corona Plaza, the beating heart of one of New York City's largest Latin American neighborhoods, fell quiet in the days after President Donald Trump was inaugurated.\n\nThe restaurant's Mexican waitress, who is in the U.S. without legal status, witnessed federal immigration authorities arrest someone a few blocks from the plaza, and now limits her time outside, afraid that being on the street leaves her more vulnerable to immigration agents. She dwells on the incident as she stares at empty tables once packed with immigrant families and construction workers.\n\nAcross the street, sales have plummeted at a Colombian bakery. The shop used to take in about $1,600 most mornings selling soups and pastries, but now makes about $900. Workers at the bakery scour WhatsApp groups for news of immigration raids in the neighborhood, even as the messaging app swirls with misinformation.\n\nAnd at the Guatemalan restaurant at the edge of the plaza, fewer customers are dining in, with sales declining by about half. But takeout orders have picked up.\n\n\"Everyone calls for food now,\" Linda Hernandez, 44, said as she served a baked tamal to one of four customers in the 20-seat restaurant in early February, next to a sign warning people not to open their doors to immigration authorities. \"No one wants to sit down to eat.\"\n\nFrom New York to California, Trump's campaign to arrest and deport millions of unauthorized immigrants has spread fear and consternation, instantly subduing once-lively neighborhoods across the United States.\n\nThe administration began with a media blitz, publicizing raids in big cities and deportation flights to Latin America. The showmanship was supported by some early numbers that showed an increase in immigration arrests, even as the authorities appear to be struggling to round up enough people to meet Trump's mass deportation goals. The shock-and-awe tactic, however, has profoundly rattled immigrant communities.\n\nFew neighborhoods in New York were paralyzed like Corona, a working-class enclave that is about 75% Hispanic, home to generations of immigrants from Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and elsewhere.\n\nBut Corona was also one of the neighborhoods that swung most sharply toward Trump in last year's election. Trump's inroads, in Corona and elsewhere, exposed simmering tension between established immigrants and more recent arrivals who crossed the border during an era of more lenient Democratic policies.\n\nImmigration, legal and otherwise, has long shaped this stretch of northern Queens. Waves of migration transformed Corona from an Italian stronghold at the turn of the 20th century into a magnet for African American families after World War II, and then a bustling hub for Central and South Americans in recent decades.\n\nThat diversity has been most palpable in Corona Plaza, once a forlorn lot. The city paved it into a modest pedestrian plaza that quickly pulsated with life as vendors moved in to sell chorizos and cafe de olla, filling the air with a mix of Spanish dialects. Nearby, on Roosevelt Avenue, the aroma of Colombian coffee melded with the scent of lomo saltado from Peru, the blaring rhythms of cumbia and reggaeton and the roar of the elevated No. 7 train.\n\nMany residents here crowd into cheap apartments with strangers. Most work the service jobs that form the backbone of the city's economy: cleaning, cooking, building.\n\nMany are in the country without legal permission.\n\nSo it was perhaps no surprise that the once-bustling plaza, and the streets around it, cleared out the day Trump was inaugurated. Immigrants stayed indoors. Food vendors retreated. And many people continued to stay off the streets as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents fanned out across the city a week later, an absence that hurt local businesses.\n\nThe combination of deportation fears, frigid temperatures and a recent police crackdown on illegal vending all helped mute the neighborhood -- and created an eerily familiar scene in what was once the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic. The virus killed hundreds in Corona and hobbled the area's economic recovery.\n\n\"It reminds me of COVID, but this is new,\" said Fernando Cando, 48, who moved to Queens from Ecuador with his family in 1982, when he was a young boy. \"If I were to sum it up with one word, it's panic. We've never seen this.\"\n\nCando owns Leticias, an Ecuadorean restaurant with dishes based on his mother's recipes. He said he recently began brushing up on his workers' rights in case ICE shows up at the restaurant. He has instructed the workers not to run from agents, and has wondered whether they could take refuge in the restaurant's basement. Despite the fear, his workers continue to show up, even if diners aren't always there with the same frequency.\n\nICE sightings -- whether real, imagined or distorted on social media and text threads -- dominate conversations. Some parents have stopped sending their children to school. And some families are talking about moving back to their home countries: the \"self-deportation\" that the Trump administration is actively encouraging.\n\n(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nLiliana Sanchez, who migrated from Mexico two decades ago, said she spotted ICE officers almost daily in the neighborhood after Trump took office, usually knocking on people's doors. The sightings have been less frequent recently. But her two children, who are U.S. citizens, still call her after school to make sure she has not been detained in Corona Plaza while selling atole, a hot masa-based Mexican drink.\n\n\"They're afraid for me every time I come sell,\" Sanchez, 38, said in Spanish. \"But if I stay home, who's going to bring home the money for rent?\"\n\n(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nImmigration lawyers are being inundated with calls from immigrants seeking answers to basic questions: Can they go to work, seek care at hospitals and call the police to report a crime without being deported?\n\n\"The phones are ringing off the hook,\" said Anibal Romero, an immigration lawyer whose office overlooking Corona Plaza has received as many as 700 calls a day since Trump's inauguration, up from just under 100 a day. \"We've frankly become an emergency room for mental health.\"\n\nEven so, the heightened anxiety, described by nearly two dozen Corona residents in interviews with The New York Times, belies a complicated reality.\n\nIn New York City, and across the country, Trump made significant gains in many working-class immigrant neighborhoods like Corona. He captured 46% of the national Latino vote on his way to victory and bucked conventional wisdom about Hispanics' support of the Democratic Party.\n\nKamala Harris still won Corona with about 57% of the vote, but underperformed compared with Joe Biden in 2020, who won the area with 77% of the vote. Trump garnered about 3,000 more votes in Corona in 2024 than in 2020, winning entire precincts and nearly doubling his vote share to 42%, up from 23% four years before.\n\nTrump won over Hispanics who were upset about the economy, but also tapped into resentment among established immigrants over what they regarded as preferential treatment -- including temporary legal status, work permits and free shelter -- given to migrants who arrived during the Biden administration.\n\nIn New York City, that pent-up frustration led to intense friction amid a three-year influx of 230,000 migrants who spilled into Corona and other neighborhoods. Longtime residents -- even undocumented immigrants who can't vote -- raised quality-of-life concerns that many attributed to the recent arrivals.\n\n(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nBusiness owners in Corona Plaza complained about an increase in homelessness and street vendors without licenses in recent years. Local officials and residents lamented excessive trash and flashes of violence among intoxicated men who they said created visible disorder that scared off customers. And a prostitution problem long plaguing parts of Roosevelt Avenue grew worse.\n\nThat all led Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat, to deploy more police officers to the area and crack down on brothels and illegal vending last year, leading to a noticeable decline in both.\n\nFor some Corona residents, it was too little, too late.\n\nAltagracia Fernandez, from the Dominican Republic, said the deteriorating conditions had nearly caused her to shutter the beauty salon she opened 35 years ago. Things got so bad, she said, that hosing down human excrement outside her shop became a regular morning chore.\n\n\"I always voted Democratic, but I couldn't take it anymore,\" said Fernandez, 63, who voted for Trump. \"The situation got too severe. I'm fighting for what is mine,\" she said, referring to her salon.\n\n(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nPastor Victor Tiburcio, the spiritual leader of Aliento de Vida, a Pentecostal church on Corona Plaza with more than 2,500 congregants from 30 countries, has been grappling with those contradictions since Trump's election.\n\nOn a recent Sunday, Tiburcio leaned on a message of hope. He urged worried churchgoers to be mindful of misinformation and not to fear calling 911 or going to the hospital.\n\n\"Don't abstain from doing what you have to do out of fear for ICE,\" he said in a crowded theater-turned-church, a glimmer of the vibrancy that has not been fully extinguished in the neighborhood. \"Finding God is an SOS during these times.\"\n\nIn an interview after the service, Tiburcio, who migrated from the Dominican Republic 27 years ago, reflected on what he said was the silver lining of Trump's crackdown. Almost overnight, he said, the president's tough talk had scared off unruly migrants whom the pastor blamed for \"fetid\" conditions in Corona and for tarnishing the working-class values that defined immigrants.\n\n(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\n\"Those people that arrived here in the past few years -- and I can't say all of them, because I'm an immigrant, too -- but we noticed something weird,\" said Tiburcio, referring to instances of loitering and public drinking.\n\n\"Once Trump came in, they disappeared,\" he continued. \"Immigrants should be welcomed, helped. The Bible says that. But the Bible does not say that an immigrant has a right to delinquency.\"\n\n(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nOther immigrants, though uneasy about the high-profile crimes committed by some recent arrivals, were more wary of stoking rifts between recent immigrants and those who have been here longer.\n\n\"It's not resentment,\" said Faviana Linares, 47, who migrated from Mexico nearly three decades ago. \"You have to be very brave to leave everything behind and bring your family here. I admire those people.\"\n\n(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)\n\nLinares left everything behind when she departed Puebla -- so many people have migrated from the Mexican region that New York has become known as \"Puebla York\" -- and settled in Corona. She has made a living cleaning apartments, initially for well below the minimum wage, while her husband works at restaurants. Neither has legal U.S. residency status, but their three children are U.S. citizens.\n\nLike many mixed-status families, they have made emergency plans in case the parents are deported: Their 24-year-old daughter would become the guardian of the two other children.\n\nDespite the ever-present possibility that the family will be separated -- Linares has cousins who were deported -- she said she has concentrated on transmitting hope to her children and neighbors amid the doom-and-gloom headlines.\n\nRecently, that has meant channeling her energy into the immigrant advocacy group she belongs to, Make the Road New York, which opened a new office across from Corona Plaza in February, just as the neighborhood fell quiet.\n\n\"Our only crime was to cross that border,\" Linares said. \"It's not fair to feel persecuted. All we came to do was to work with dignity.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.","summary":"NEW YORK -- The taco joint just around the corner from Corona Plaza, the beating heart of one of New York City's largest Latin American neighborhoods, fell quiet in the days after President Donald Trump was inaugurated.","url":"https://www.berkshireeagle.com/nyt/an-immigrant-neighborhood-where-trump-made-inroads-now-fears-ice-raids/article_2305c3fc-22d6-5c92-9b9c-d2e843496306.html","image":"https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/berkshireeagle.com/content/tncms/custom/image/2b802cce-8455-11ec-8935-3f9640429655.jpg?resize=600%2C315","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-02 21:20:24","author":"Blox Content Management,Luis Ferré-Sadurní","authors":["Blox Content Management","Luis Ferré-Sadurní"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.038},{"id":295985532,"title":"GOP rips ‘spineless’ Dem LI Rep.

Tom Suozzi is coming under fire for voting against a bill that would ban transgender women from competing against female athletes.\n\nRepublicans now plan to use Suozzi’s no vote as ammo against his re-election next year.\n\n“Spineless Tom Suozzi lied to voters, blatantly flip-flopped his position, and abandoned his district when he sided with [House Democratic minority leader] Hakeem Jeffries and [Gov.]Kathy Hochul by voting to allow boys to compete in girls’ sports,” charged National Republican Congressional Campaign Committee spokeswoman Maureen O’Toole.\n\nSuozzi’s home base of Nassau County last year approved one of the nation’s first laws barring biological men who identify as transgender women from competing in female sports in county facilities.\n\nAfter narrowly winning re-election in November, Suozzi had said, “The Democrats have to stop pandering to the far left. \n\n“I don’t want to discriminate against anybody, but I don’t think biological boys should be playing in girls’ sports. Democrats aren’t saying that, and they should be,” he said.\n\nBut he then voted against the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act in the US House on Jan. 14, when it was passed along partisan lines 216-206, with two Texas Democrats breaking ranks to support it.\n\nAnother Long Island Democratic House member, first-term Rep. Laura Gillen, also voted against the trans-ban bill.\n\n“I am disappointed that our [Long Island] Congressional Delegation chose to support their Democrat Party bosses rather than their constituents,” said Republican Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman.\n\n“The girls and women who only want fair competition and a safe environment to compete.”\n\nSuozzi won re-election over Republican Mike LiPetri by a narrow 4 percentage points in the third House District covering parts of Nassau County and Queens in November. President Trump carried the district at the top of the ticket by 4 percentage points over Democrat Kamala Harris.\n\nThe congressman defended his anti-trans-ban vote to The Post on Sunday.\n\n“This is a typical political attack and gotcha game,” Suozzi said. “I do not believe transgender women should compete in competitive women’s sports, but this poorly written, partisan bill would subject young girls to invasive exams and encourage bullying based on appearance.\n\n“Instead, we should rely on sports governing bodies to establish fair rules for competitive women’s sports and education experts to develop appropriate guidelines for elementary and high schools,” he said.\n\nThe GOP is hopeful that the measure will also pass the Republican-controlled Senate and head to President Trump’s desk for his signature. The Senate bill was introduced by Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.), a former Auburn University football coach.\n\nDemocrats in control of the Senate blocked the bill there last year, but Republicans are now in charge.","summary":"Long Island Democratic Rep.

The comments come as evidence continues to mount that Trump’s policies have rapidly improved the situation at the southern border, including news last week that single-day border apprehensions had hit a 15-year low, with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents encountering only 200 aliens at the border on February 22. \"President Trump and Secretary Noem have sent a clear message to illegal aliens: Do not come to our country. You will not be allowed in. And if you get in, we will hunt you down and deport you,\" a DHS spokesperson said in a release at the time. TRUMP REPORTS ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT ENCOUNTERS AT HISTORIC LOWS DURING FIRST FULL MONTH IN OFFICE That news came just days after Border Patrol Chief Mike Banks told CBS News in an interview that southern border crossings were down 94% from the same period last year, a staggering number he credited to the Trump administration’s aggressive crackdown. While Trump has managed to reduce the numbers through his executive authority, many Democrats spent 2024 arguing that the continued crisis at the border was the result of Trump and his allies in the GOP tying the president’s hands by resisting a bipartisan border bill that was working its way through the Senate early in the year and was favored by former President Joe Biden. \"Every day between now and November, the American people are going to know that the only reason the border is not secure is Donald Trump and his MAGA Republican friends,\" Biden said in February after the bill failed to pass. \"Frankly, I would have preferred to address this issue through bipartisan legislation, because that’s the only way to actually get the kind of system we have now that’s broken, fixed. To hire more Border Patrol agents, more asylum officers, more judges. But, Republicans left me no choice,\" Biden said in June while announcing new executive actions on border security Republicans argued didn’t go far enough to alleviate the crisis. That blame game continued throughout the 2024 campaign, with top Democratic leaders piling on Trump for helping kill the legislation they claimed was vital to ending the crisis. ‘HE IS DELIVERING’: TRUMP'S FIRST MONTH FLIPS SCRIPT ON RADICAL BIDEN-HARRIS BORDER POLICIES \"If my Republican colleagues truly believe the system is broken, why did they vote against a bill that would have provided more immigration judges, more asylum officers, and had the support of the very conservative Border Patrol Union?\" then-Senate Majority Leader Chuck Shumer asked in a May press release on border security. \"When Americans ask this year who is to blame for the continued mess at the border, they should listen to the words that came from Donald Trump himself,\" Schumer added. Former Vice President Kamala Harris took the torch and continued to blame Republicans for the crisis after rising to the top of the Democratic ticket, arguing that the legislation would have fixed the issues at the border if not for Trump’s intervention. \"Donald Trump got word of this bill that would have contributed to securing our border,\" Harris said during an August interview. \"He preferred to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem,\" Harris said during a September debate with Trump. \"Because he believed that it would not have helped him politically, he told his folks in Congress, ‘Don’t put it forward.’\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"He killed the bill, a border security bill that would have put 1,500 more agents on the border,\" she added. But Ries argued that not only did Trump’s executive actions help alleviate the crisis once he took office, but Democrats had another legislative option all along in border security legislation that had already passed through the Republican-controlled House. \"The Senate could’ve passed HR-2, the Secure the Border Act … the House had already passed it, and it was collecting dust on the Senate’s desk,\" Ries said.","summary":"President Donald Trump&apos;s quick success at securing the border calls into question the emphasis Democrats placed on the Senate&apos;s bipartisan border bill last year.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dems-trump-killed-immigration-bill-success-border-proves-had-right-idea-expert","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/06/931/523/trump-biden-border.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-02 20:18:11","author":"Michael Lee","authors":["Michael Lee"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.498},{"id":296018030,"title":"Star of iconic 90s sitcom, 50, seen on rare outing in LA... can you guess who?","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nMonday, Mar 3rd 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOscars best dressed!

There is a documentary about Cyclone Tracy for the history buffs – and to round it all out, the intriguingly titled Nightbitch. \n\nIt seems appropriate that Netflix’s attempt to create a show that captures the state of US politics should be as absurd and troubling as the first months of the Trump administration. Zero Day stretches the bounds of credibility, but, like Trump, it is hypnotic viewing.\n\nA former president, George Mullen (Robert de Niro) is called upon to track down the source of a cyber-attack which turns off all power for one minute, leading to multiple deaths. \n\nMullen’s own family story becomes central to the plot, involving both his wife (Joan Allen) and daughter (Lizzy Caplan) – who conveniently happens to be a congresswoman, clearly inspired by left-wing congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nZero Day is full of such references, from the current president (Angela Bassett), a nod to Kamala Harris, to a populist radio host and a sinister tech tycoon. \n\nAmerican reviews have complained the series tries too hard to appeal across partisan lines, to suggest woke calls from the left is equivalent to extremism on the right. Yes, there’s a fuzziness to the politics of Zero Day. But I saw it as a cry of despair at the state of American public life which is also highly entertaining television. \n\n– Dennis Altman\n\nWhat does it mean to tell the truth? And how do we, as consumers of media, differentiate truth from fabrication? Optics, a new comedy series from the ABC, asks these questions through the setting of a public relations firm.\n\nThe show expertly balances humour with quick-wit, social media vernacular, and a level of marketing wordsmithing that makes you question if the news has ever told you a true story.\n\nThe show is based in the PR firm Fritz & Randell and opens with the death of its aging CEO Frank Fritz (Peter Carroll), in a men-only board meeting no less.\n\nAfter Frank’s death, the son of the cofounder, Ian Randell (Charles Firth) makes a bid for top spot. But the owner of the firm, Bobby Bahl (Claude Jabbour) is concerned with “optics”, so he puts two young women in charge instead.\n\nTheir young, spunky attitude and social media prowess is seen as a massive advantage. And it is. But it soon becomes apparent this move is much more than a feminist fresh-take for the firm – and is rather a bid to push some skeletons further back in the closet.\n\nWith outrageous lines such as “is there an emoji for miscarriage”, you are guaranteed an entertaining watch. The show will have you questioning the stories you yourself are presented through news outlets. Further still, it will make you wonder how many hands those stories passed through before they hit the papers and screens.\n\n– Edith Jennifer Hill\n\n Read more:\n ABC's Optics is a clever, believable comedy that will make you second-guess what you see in the media\n\nNetflix (Australia), ThreeNow (New Zealand)\n\nN00b is a coming-of-age story set in small town Gore, New Zealand, a proverbial “arse-end” of the world. Under show creator Victoria Boult, the series bristles with a vibrancy and edginess.\n\nIt’s a familiar story of rugby jocks (“boys”) and popular kids, geeks, misfits, and their witless teachers. It’s something of a modest, reality snapshot of the teen dramas it so confidently riffs on, shows like Laguna Beach and The O.C. \n\nBut what makes this a courageous entry in the genre is N00b’s willingness to be both uproariously funny and caustically cynical. This is a very funny teen comedy, and yet it is also dark and provocative in ways I found refreshing and quite surprising.\n\nBoult cut her teeth on film studies at the University of Sydney and then went on to work with Jane Campion on The Power of the Dog. The sureness of vision and the deftness of the way in which Boult understands genre is so impressive. The production is based on Boult’s viral TikTok series of the same name (which I can highly recommend). \n\nI sincerely hope that N00b finds a major audience and perhaps even garners a cult following. Highly recommend. \n\n– Bruce Isaacs\n\nThe Traitors US and UK, seasons three\n\nTenPlay (Australia), ThreeNow (New Zealand)\n\nThe third seasons from The Traitors UK and US are fantastic companion pieces, with respective hosts Claudia Winkleman and Alan Cumming guiding the plucky contestants with their camp prowess. \n\nWith their third seasons, the creative teams behind each version have realised that the more theatrical the better, with Winkleman and Cumming leading the charge with their sass and eccentric fashion choices. The setting of Ardross Castle (for both series) in the Scottish Highlands helps. \n\nThe premise is simple: a cast of contestants must complete challenges to earn money for the kitty. Hidden among the faithful contestants are traitors. If a traitor makes it to the end, they keep the money for themselves. \n\nEach episode, the faithfuls must banish a contestant who they think is a traitor. That evening, the traitors also meet in their turret, wearing mysterious cloaks of course, to “murder” a contestant in their sleep. \n\nThe British season has a diverse cast of everyday contestants, with standouts being one person who gives herself away as a traitor within seconds of being chosen, and another faking a Welsh accent to appear more down to earth. \n\nThe US season is vastly different with a cast of former reality television show icons. Here, it’s fascinating to see how contestants from different franchises, such as RuPaul’s Drag Race, Real Housewives, Survivor and Big Brother all approach the game differently. \n\nBoth the American and British versions of The Traitors are fantastic viewing and it’s a genuine shame that the Australian version was let down with substandard casting choices and an aesthetic that was the antithesis of camp.\n\n– Stuart Richards\n\nCyclone Tracy\n\nOn Christmas Eve 2024, Australia remembered the 50th anniversary of the destruction of Darwin wrought by Cyclone Tracy. Fittingly, the 9 Now streaming service marked this anniversary by featuring the 1986 miniseries Cyclone Tracy, a vivid depiction of 1970s Darwin and the terrible impact of the cyclone. \n\nCyclone Tracy stars Tracy Mann as Connie, a widow and mother of two who has just paid off the mortgage of her hotel, which serves as the central stage for the drama. \n\nThe series captures the cultural diversity of Darwin (though some portrayals veer towards caricature at times), and the city itself is beautifully evoked through archival footage and great production design. The cyclone itself is frightening, and its destructive power is powerfully evoked (the series’ director of photography, Andrew Lesnie, would later win an Oscar for cinematography).\n\nIn the mid-1980s, when this series first went to air, many viewers would have still been coming to terms with this terrible disaster: it was an act of storytelling for the nation. Watching it in 2025, Cyclone Tracy reminds us of the importance of these nation-making television programs that were once such an important part of Australian culture. \n\n– Michelle Arrow\n\nApple Cider Vinegar\n\nApple Cider Vinegar tells the story of the elaborate cancer con orchestrated by Australian blogger Annabelle (Belle) Gibson.\n\nFor anyone who followed Gibson during her rise to fame in the 2010s – or her spectacular fall – the show feels eerily familiar.\n\nFrom the clothing, to the makeup, to the food, Apple Cider Vinegar excels in set design and staging. Every effort has been made to ensure this true story, based on a lie, looks like it did when it was unfolding on our phone screens in the 2010s.\n\nAs someone who followed Gibson closely and spent months hunting down the recalled cookbook to see if the health claims were as outlandish as I’d heard (they were), this show was a treat to watch.\n\nThe scenes are cut with recreations of Belle’s stylised Instagram pictures of green juices, beaches and food with “no nasties”. Belle’s account was removed from Instagram after the massive public ousting of her hoax.\n\nApple Cider Vinegar has done an incredible job recreating this account and breathing life back into the deleted content.\n\nWhether or not you are already familiar with Gibson’s story, Apple Cider Vinegar is a compelling watch. You’ll especially love it if you enjoy non-fiction productions that play with ideas of truth such as iTonya, the Tinder Swindler and Inventing Anna.\n\n– Edith Jennifer Hill\n\n Read more:\n Belle Gibson built a 'wellness' empire on a lie about cancer. Apple Cider Vinegar expertly unravels her con\n\nInvisible Boys\n\nStan (Australia), TVNZ+ (New Zealand)\n\nStan’s new series Invisible Boys follows four young gay men as they understand and explore their identities while living in Geraldton, a regional town in Western Australia.\n\nCharlie Roth (Joseph Zada), Zeke Calogero (Aydan Calafiore), Kade “Hammer” Hammersmith (Zach Blampied) and Matt Jones (Joe Klocek) represent four very different young men. Yet they share the experience of feeling invisible because of their sexuality.\n\nAn adaptation of Holden Sheppard’s novel of the same name, the story challenges linear narratives of progress and typical ideals of queer life. It also shows how such mentalities can lead gay and bisexual men growing up in regional Australia to feel invisible, as they often don’t fit the neat narratives associated with “progress”.\n\nNo previous teen drama has been quite as truthful in its representation of some young gay and bisexual men’s experiences.\n\nAs someone who grew up gay in regional Australia, it feels like an authentic representation of my own experience. There’s something universal about Charlie, Zeke, Kade and Matt’s stories of not fitting in, and of being invisible to be safe.\n\nMost striking is the way the series captures the complicated mix of joy and fear – the clash of opportunity and consequence – that accompanies becoming visibly gay in these environments.\n\n– Damien O'Meara\n\n Read more:\n Stan's Invisible Boys carries the tradition of real, gritty Aussie teen drama, while smashing it into something new\n\n“Motherhood,” the beleaguered stay-at-home mother of Nightbitch tells us in contemplative voice-over, “is probably the most violent experience a human can have aside from death itself”.\n\nThe film sets out to show motherhood is also far more savage and feral than the anodyne images posted on social media by retrograde tradwives or mumfluencers would have us believe.\n\nAs Nightbitch puts it, it’s “fucking brutal”.\n\nMother (Amy Adams) is an unnamed installation artist who places her career on hold to raise her young son. Wrung out by the demands of motherhood and increasingly furious with the lack of support she receives from her incompetent and often absent Husband (Scoot McNairy), Mother starts to spiral out of control, morphing into a dog complete with tail, sharpened canines, extra nipples and a ravenous desire for raw meat.\n\nNightbitch takes the fear of the reproductive woman literally, drawing on magic realism and horror tropes to show the visceral and psychological metamorphosis women undergo on becoming mothers. Unfortunately director Marielle Heller’s refusal to lean into the body horror results in a neutered narrative with more bark than bite.\n\n– Rachel Williamson\n\n Read more:\n A new wave of filmmakers are exploring motherhood's discontents.

Maura Healey said during an interview with The New York Times that the Democratic Party was \"hampered\" by having former President Joe Biden as the party's \"communicator in chief\" at the time, and conceded that it hurt the party in the election. \"I think the party was hampered by having President Biden as the communicator in chief, if I’m being honest. He wasn’t the strongest communicator in chief, and that hurt us because they weren’t able to sell all of the important accomplishments effectively,\" she told The New York Times' Lulu Garcia-Navarro. Healey urged the former president, who eventually dropped out of his re-election campaign before endorsing former Vice President Kamala Harris, to \"carefully evaluate\" his path forward following his June debate performance, which prompted a number of Democrats to demand Biden drop out. \"Are we grappling with what happened and having to deal with it right now? You better believe it. We’ve got Donald Trump in the White House. I think it was very hard for Kamala Harris, who I thought ran a fantastic campaign, to be able to overcome the disadvantage within the time that she was allotted,\" she added.

Then we’d have the opportunity for full engagement in a primary and the like. That didn’t happen. I have no interest in further spending time on it, revisiting history. I’m focused on the now,\" Healey said. One of Biden's top advisors, Mike Donilon, was recently called out for suggesting the former president should have remained in the race and calling out the party for melting down after his debate performance. President Donald Trump recently revealed the details of a conversation he had with the former president. Trump said that Biden blamed former President Barack Obama and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for Harris' election loss. \"I asked him, I said, ‘So who do you blame?’ Because he was very angry, you know, he was a very angry guy, actually,\" Trump told The Spectator. \"And he said, ‘I blame Barack.’ And I never think of him as ‘Barack.’ You know, you always hear 'Obama.' You say, you have to think about that for a second. And he said, ‘and I also blame Nancy Pelosi.’\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE Members of the Democratic Party have been scrambling to figure out where they went wrong after Harris' loss to Trump. Pelosi, who is seen as a major force behind getting Biden to drop out, notably suggested that Biden should have dropped out earlier. \"Had the president gotten out sooner, there may have been other candidates in the race,\" Pelosi said in November. \"And as I say, Kamala may have, I think she would have done well in [a primary] and been stronger going forward.

Don't you want Donald Trump to shut the f*ck up?\" Armstrong said during his gig at the Marvel Stadium on Sunday. His comments drew applause from the jam-packed crowd. You can watch the video of Armstrong's comment below: Billie Joe Armstrong has been a staunch critic of President Trump. He endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris during the 2024 Presidential Election and urged his followers to \"stop Trumpism once and for all.\" \"I think there's probably a lot of things that people disagree with, but the one thing that ... we do agree on, is Trump has got to go, and we need to turn the page,\" the Green Day frontman said. During a concert in Washington, DC, in July last year, Armstrong held up a mask of Trump with the word idiot received on it.

Practically, it revokes an executive order signed by former President Bill Clinton in August 2000 that required federal agencies to provide services to people with limited English proficiency. Trump’s order doesn’t actually require agencies to stop providing translated documents and interpretation services; instead, the decision will now be up to agency heads.\n\nSymbolically, though, the order’s intention is clear: It’s part of Trump’s broader crackdown on immigrants and multiculturalism—an agenda that has also included shutting down the White House’s online presence in Spanish; requiring undocumented immigrants to register with the federal government; speeding up mass deportations by seeking to bypass court hearings; and turning deportations into online entertainment.\n\n“To promote unity, cultivate a shared American culture for all citizens, ensure consistency in government operations, and create a pathway to civic engagement, it is in America’s best interest for the Federal Government to designate one—and only one—official language,” the order says. “Establishing English as the official language will not only streamline communication but also reinforce shared national values, and create a more cohesive and efficient society.”\n\nThe US has never had an official language. Today, more than three-quarters of its inhabitants only speak English, Census data shows. But there are also more than 350 other languages spoken across the country, with Spanish being the most common; approximately 41.7 million people, or or roughly 13 percent of the population, spoke it in 2019. Other top spoken languages include Chinese, Tagalog, Vietnamese, and Arabic.\n\nTrump, though, has long argued for monolingualism. On the campaign trail in 2015, he mocked then-rival for the Republican nomination Jeb Bush for speaking Spanish. “This is a country where we speak English, not Spanish,” Trump said at the time. More recently, during his first and only debate against Democratic rival and then-Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump made clear that his attack on multilingualism is an attack on immigration: “Our elections are bad,” he said. “And a lot of these illegal immigrants coming in, they’re trying to get them to vote. They can’t even speak English.” \n\nWhile more than 30 states have reportedly designated English as their official language, several recognize multiple official languages: Hawaii designated both Hawaiian and English as its official languages; Alaska recognizes more than 20; and both Spanish and English are the official languages of Puerto Rico. But according to the White House, the fact that the Bill of Rights and Declaration of Independence were written in English is apparently enough to justify its latest move.\n\nDespite the fact that Trump’s executive order is essentially optional for federal agencies, advocates warn it could embolden racism and xenophobia, which has already been flourishing since Trump’s reelection. “America has never had an official language—because we don’t need one,” the Congressional Hispanic Caucus said in a post on X. “Trump’s plan to make English official is a direct attack on our diversity and history. Millions of Americans speak other languages, and that doesn’t make them any less American.”\n\nThe Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus called the order “a thinly-veiled attempt to allow federal agencies to discriminate against immigrants and individuals with limited English proficiency.” \n\n“What happens when a senior with limited English proficiency needs help accessing their earned Social Security benefits? Or when a non-native English speaker needs help enrolling in Medicare?” the group asked in a statement posted on X.\n\nAnabel Mendoza, communications director for United We Dream, an immigrant advocacy group, told the Associated Press: “Trump is trying to send the message that if you’re not white, rich and speak English you don’t belong here. Let me be clear: Immigrants are here to stay. No matter how hard Trump tries, he can’t erase us.” \n\nAccording to MAGA, world, though, the executive order gets him one step closer. “This is HUGE,” Charlie Kirk, founder of Turning Point USA, wrote on X when the news was announced Friday. “In an era of mass immigration, asserting that the English language as the American language, is a message of national UNITY.”","summary":"On Saturday, President Donald Trump signed an executive order making English the country&#8217;s &#8220;official language.&#8221; The move is a bureaucratic—and largely symbolic—means of enacting Trump&#8217;s xenophobic agenda.

So I think, you know, the first thing I would say is the Associated Press is 179 years old. We're a global, independent, non-partisan news organization that's had a commitment to covering the White House since our founding. And you know, really you mentioned this is about Gulf of America, Gulf of Mexico, you know, yes, it's about that, but it's also about something so much bigger. You know, this is about freedom of speech and that is a principle, a right that Americans across the political spectrum believe in deeply.\n\nThis is about whether the government can control the language that we use, that ordinary people can use. And it's about whether the government can retaliate against you if you don't use the language that they prefer. So we are standing up for that right, not just for the AP, but for all independent news organizations and for the public because we believe, again, that this is a principle, freedom of speech that all Americans, regardless of their political party, should believe in.\n\nPart of this fight is about how AP's Stylebook is the one who tries to control the language that people use by imposing their own woke linguistic judgments on AP clients and the media as a whole.

Elizabeth Warren\n\nDemocratic Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has criticized billionaires throughout her career, making policies on taxing the wealthy a staple of her political campaigns. Since 2019, Warren has even sold mugs branding the words “billionaire tears” for $28 on her campaign’s website. When she began selling them in 2019, they were $25.\n\nDespite her strong anti-billionaire sentiments, Warren accepted funding from at least 30 billionaires from 2011-2019, according to a New York Post review of her campaign donations.\n\nWarren posted on X during President Donald Trump’s presidential run that he “promised” his “rich as hell donors” tax cuts that won’t “help working people one bit.”\n\nOn Feb. 12 Warren told Rolling Stone that Trump is trying to “distract” people from his “failure to cut costs for families” and that he is “play[ing] up to the billionaires.”\n\nGeorge and Alex Soros, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, Susan Pritzker, wife of Hyatt heir Nicholas Pritzker II, Christopher Sacca, a venture capitalist who went on “Shark Tank,” GitHub founder Tom Preston-Werner’s wife, Theresa, and David Geffen, co-founder of DreamWorks and many more all donated thousands of dollars to Warren’s presidential and senatorial campaigns, according to the New York Post.\n\nFormer President Joe Biden\n\nFormer President Joe Biden began his presidency calling for “unity” in his inaugural address but left office warning that an “oligarchy” was “taking shape in America of extreme wealth, power, and influence that literally threatens our entire democracy ” in his farewell speech.\n\nBiden took funding from at least 230 billionaires during his 2020 presidential campaign, which amounted to 25% of America’s billionaires at the time, according to Forbes. Trump received money from only 14% of American billionaires that year.\n\nBiden’s menagerie of ultrarich backers included George Soros, Ralph Lauren, Mellody Hobson, wife of George Lucas, Eric Schmidt, former CEO at Google, the founders of companies like DoorDash, Patagonia, and Netflix, as well as the family heirs to the Walmart fortune. Some billionaire donors gave a few thousand dollars, and others gave up to 1.7 million.\n\nForbes noted that at least 60 Biden donors also gave to some of Biden’s super-PACs, Facebook cofounder Dustin Moskovitz contributing $47 million, and Mike Bloomberg rolling out $100 million.\n\nBiden also presented his billionaire donor George Soros the Presidential Medal of Freedom last month, along with Hillary Clinton and Denzel Washington.\n\nI’m so grateful my father was honored for his lifetime of work devoted to freedom and human rights. It was humbling to be with such an astounding group of honorees. Especially poignant to be alongside Bono and @HillaryClinton, two of the people my father has the highest regard… pic.twitter.com/Vx3KrQ4ELj\n\n— Alex Soros (@AlexanderSoros) January 5, 2025 \n\n“I love Bernie, but I’m not Bernie Sanders. I don’t think 500 billionaires are the reason why we’re in trouble,” Biden said in 2018 at the Brookings Institution. “The folks at the top aren’t bad guys. I get in trouble in my party when I say wealthy Americans are just as patriotic as poor folks. I’ve found no distinction.”\n\nDemocratic Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison\n\nIn a video posted to X on Feb. 5, Democratic Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison repeated former President Joe Biden’s “oligarch” claim. He concluded the video with a call to action, “the small, tiny little group of oligarchs that are trying to destroy our democracy, we can stop them if we band together. We are the many, they are the money and we can overwhelm them.” (RELATED: Charlamagne Says It Was ‘Highly Hypocritical For Biden To ‘Talk About Oligarchy’ In Farewell Speech)\n\nIn 2018, Ellison accepted $100,000 from Alex Soros, George Soros’ son and business successor, according to the Washington Free Beacon. This amount represents a little less than half of funds raised by an independent expenditure committee devoted to Ellison’s campaign success.\n\n With one of America’s greatest leaders and a dear friend, Minnesota Attorney General @keithellison. pic.twitter.com/pdcncF6174 — Alex Soros (@AlexanderSoros) August 17, 2022 \n\nAlex Soros, like his father, is a left-wing billionaire philanthropist. “He’s a lot more on the fringe than his dad was,” Joseph Vazquez, associate editor and George Soros expert at the Media Research Center told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “He’s going to be a much more potent political threat.”\n\nVazquez said that Alex Soros might use his father’s business like “a wrecking ball,” and that he may “take that $32 billion empire and smash it against wherever he needs to in order to turn his father’s vision into reality.”\n\nVazquez and Tom Olohan outline why Alex Soros “could be even worse” than his father in an MRC special report titled “Meet the New Boss.” The authors conclude in the report that Alex Soros might be “more radical than his father on everything from abortion to climate change to the weaponization of race to demonize his political opponents.”\n\nEllison was one of the several democratic officials that filed a federal lawsuit against Trump’s executive order banning child sex-changes. He said in a statement on Feb. 7 that “our children deserve so much better than to be targeted … by the President of the United States and his billionaire cronies,” pointing to how child sex-changes are “evidence based” and this executive order is “mean-spirited and deeply hurtful.” (RELATED: Trump Signs Executive Order Banning Federal Funding For Child Sex Changes)\n\nDemocratic Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar\n\nDemocratic Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar recently joked about Trump being “for sale,” though records show she has accepted funding from at least 21 billionaires.\n\n“What is the difference between Greenland and Donald Trump? Greenland is not for sale,” Klobuchar said at the Washington Press Club Foundation Annual Congressional Dinner, according to the Huffington Post.\n\nDuring Klobuchar’s 2020 presidential campaign she accepted donations from 15 billionaires and 6 of their spouses, including LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman, according to a Forbes analysis of federal election findings.\n\nDNC Chair Ken Martin\n\nNewly-elected Democratic Party Chair Ken Martin has contributed to this anti-billionaire narrative multiple times. “Trump and the billionaire cabinet … bought this country,” he wrote on X on Feb. 7. George Soros gave at least $250,000 to Martin’s Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor (DFL) party in 2022, according to the Center of the American Experiment, a Minnesota-based think tank.\n\n“Are we on the side of the robber baron, the ultra-wealthy billionaires, the oil and gas polluter, the union buster, or are we on the side of the American working family?” Martin asked the DNC crowd during his acceptance speech on Feb. 1.\n\nOn Jan. 19, while Martin was still a DNC Chair candidate, he went on record saying he will only take money from “good billionaires” going forward.

Nancy wrote on X on Feb. 10 that “Republicans are enabling financial predators to rip off hardworking Americans to reward their billionaire donors.”\n\nThe Golden State Representative is tied to House Majority Forward, a dark money nonprofit that received $3 million from Swiss billionaire Hansjorg Wyss in 2020, according to Fox.\n\nPelosi has received much criticism for her own high net worth over her career, as some estimates rank her as one of the wealthiest members of congress.\n\nMany have suspected that Pelosi, along with her husband, Paul Pelosi, have participated in insider trading. Paul Pelosi has refuted these claims. (RELATED: Nancy Pelosi’s Stock Portfolio Explodes In Value, Beats Market By Nearly 200%)\n\nBONUS: Independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders\n\nIndependent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders announced plans to fight “the oligarchy” on Feb. 12. His spokesperson Anna Bahr told Politico that Sanders will support “working-class people” while “Donald Trump and Elon Musk march us toward authoritarianism, oligarchy, and kleptocracy.”\n\nThe Washington Free Beacon reported the senator’s change in rhetoric from critiquing both “millionaires and billionaires,” until dropping the “millionaire” once he became one in 2019.\n\nFederal filings show that Sanders received just under $500 from one billionaire donor, Marta Thoma Hall, the wife of billionaire Velodyne founder David Hall in 2019. After Forbes notified Sanders’ campaign, they claimed they wouldn’t keep the money.\n\n“Most Americans should believe that as a citizen, you’re allowed to attempt to influence the political process,” Brian Doherty, Los Angeles Times bestselling author and senior editor at libertarian magazine Reason told the DCNF. “You’re allowed to have your voice.”\n\nDoherty expressed skepticism regarding this anti-billionaire narrative. “I don’t think the democrats complaining about Elon Musk really have a political objection to … billionaires funding political causes,” Doherty said. “It’s a rhetorical red herring.”\n\nDoherty added that when voters are “aware of the range of really rich people funding both parties and both causes,” they are likely to “lose that sense of anger” regarding wealthy donor influence.\n\nThe offices of Warren, Ellison, Pelosi, Martin, Harris, Klobuchar, Newsom and Sanders did not respond to the DCNF’s request for comment.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

There is a documentary about Cyclone Tracy for the history buffs – and to round it all out, the intriguingly titled Nightbitch. \n\nIt seems appropriate that Netflix's attempt to create a show that captures the state of US politics should be as absurd and troubling as the first months of the Trump administration. Zero Day stretches the bounds of credibility, but, like Trump, it is hypnotic viewing.\n\nA former president, George Mullen (Robert de Niro) is called upon to track down the source of a cyber-attack which turns off all power for one minute, leading to multiple deaths. \n\nMullen's own family story becomes central to the plot, involving both his wife (Joan Allen) and daughter (Lizzy Caplan) – who conveniently happens to be a congresswoman, clearly inspired by left-wing congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nZero Day is full of such references, from the current president (Angela Bassett), a nod to Kamala Harris, to a populist radio host and a sinister tech tycoon. \n\nAmerican reviews have complained the series tries too hard to appeal across partisan lines, to suggest woke calls from the left is equivalent to extremism on the right. Yes, there's a fuzziness to the politics of Zero Day. But I saw it as a cry of despair at the state of American public life which is also highly entertaining television. \n\n– Dennis Altman\n\nWhat does it mean to tell the truth? And how do we, as consumers of media, differentiate truth from fabrication? Optics, a new comedy series from the ABC, asks these questions through the setting of a public relations firm.\n\nThe show expertly balances humour with quick-wit, social media vernacular, and a level of marketing wordsmithing that makes you question if the news has ever told you a true story.\n\nThe show is based in the PR firm Fritz & Randell and opens with the death of its aging CEO Frank Fritz (Peter Carroll), in a men-only board meeting no less.\n\nAfter Frank's death, the son of the cofounder, Ian Randell (Charles Firth) makes a bid for top spot. But the owner of the firm, Bobby Bahl (Claude Jabbour) is concerned with“optics”, so he puts two young women in charge instead.\n\nTheir young, spunky attitude and social media prowess is seen as a massive advantage. And it is. But it soon becomes apparent this move is much more than a feminist fresh-take for the firm – and is rather a bid to push some skeletons further back in the closet.\n\nWith outrageous lines such as“is there an emoji for miscarriage”, you are guaranteed an entertaining watch. The show will have you questioning the stories you yourself are presented through news outlets. Further still, it will make you wonder how many hands those stories passed through before they hit the papers and screens.\n\n– Edith Jennifer Hill\n\nABC's Optics is a clever, believable comedy that will make you second-guess what you see in the media\n\nNetflix (Australia), ThreeNow (New Zealand)\n\nN00b is a coming-of-age story set in small town Gore, New Zealand, a proverbial“arse-end” of the world. Under show creator Victoria Boult, the series bristles with a vibrancy and edginess.\n\nIt's a familiar story of rugby jocks (“boys”) and popular kids, geeks, misfits, and their witless teachers. It's something of a modest, reality snapshot of the teen dramas it so confidently riffs on, shows like Laguna Beach and The O.C. \n\nBut what makes this a courageous entry in the genre is N00b's willingness to be both uproariously funny and caustically cynical. This is a very funny teen comedy, and yet it is also dark and provocative in ways I found refreshing and quite surprising.\n\nBoult cut her teeth on film studies at the University of Sydney and then went on to work with Jane Campion on The Power of the Dog. The sureness of vision and the deftness of the way in which Boult understands genre is so impressive. The production is based on Boult's viral TikTok series of the same name (which I can highly recommend). \n\nI sincerely hope that N00b finds a major audience and perhaps even garners a cult following. Highly recommend. \n\n– Bruce Isaacs\n\nTenPlay (Australia), ThreeNow (New Zealand)\n\nThe third seasons from The Traitors UK and US are fantastic companion pieces, with respective hosts Claudia Winkleman and Alan Cumming guiding the plucky contestants with their camp prowess. \n\nWith their third seasons, the creative teams behind each version have realised that the more theatrical the better, with Winkleman and Cumming leading the charge with their sass and eccentric fashion choices. The setting of Ardross Castle (for both series) in the Scottish Highlands helps. \n\nThe premise is simple: a cast of contestants must complete challenges to earn money for the kitty. Hidden among the faithful contestants are traitors. If a traitor makes it to the end, they keep the money for themselves. \n\nEach episode, the faithfuls must banish a contestant who they think is a traitor. That evening, the traitors also meet in their turret, wearing mysterious cloaks of course, to“murder” a contestant in their sleep. \n\nThe British season has a diverse cast of everyday contestants, with standouts being one person who gives herself away as a traitor within seconds of being chosen, and another faking a Welsh accent to appear more down to earth. \n\nThe US season is vastly different with a cast of former reality television show icons. Here, it's fascinating to see how contestants from different franchises, such as RuPaul's Drag Race, Real Housewives, Survivor and Big Brother all approach the game differently. \n\nBoth the American and British versions of The Traitors are fantastic viewing and it's a genuine shame that the Australian version was let down with substandard casting choices and an aesthetic that was the antithesis of camp.\n\n– Stuart Richards\n\nOn Christmas Eve 2024, Australia remembered the 50th anniversary of the destruction of Darwin wrought by Cyclone Tracy . Fittingly, the 9 Now streaming service marked this anniversary by featuring the 1986 miniseries Cyclone Tracy, a vivid depiction of 1970s Darwin and the terrible impact of the cyclone. \n\nCyclone Tracy stars Tracy Mann as Connie, a widow and mother of two who has just paid off the mortgage of her hotel, which serves as the central stage for the drama. \n\nThe series captures the cultural diversity of Darwin (though some portrayals veer towards caricature at times), and the city itself is beautifully evoked through archival footage and great production design. The cyclone itself is frightening, and its destructive power is powerfully evoked (the series' director of photography, Andrew Lesnie, would later win an Oscar for cinematography).\n\nIn the mid-1980s, when this series first went to air, many viewers would have still been coming to terms with this terrible disaster: it was an act of storytelling for the nation. Watching it in 2025, Cyclone Tracy reminds us of the importance of these nation-making television programs that were once such an important part of Australian culture. \n\n– Michelle Arrow\n\nApple Cider Vinegar tells the story of the elaborate cancer con orchestrated by Australian blogger Annabelle (Belle) Gibson.\n\nFor anyone who followed Gibson during her rise to fame in the 2010s – or her spectacular fall – the show feels eerily familiar.\n\nFrom the clothing, to the makeup, to the food, Apple Cider Vinegar excels in set design and staging. Every effort has been made to ensure this true story, based on a lie, looks like it did when it was unfolding on our phone screens in the 2010s.\n\nAs someone who followed Gibson closely and spent months hunting down the recalled cookbook to see if the health claims were as outlandish as I'd heard (they were), this show was a treat to watch.\n\nThe scenes are cut with recreations of Belle's stylised Instagram pictures of green juices, beaches and food with“no nasties”. Belle's account was removed from Instagram after the massive public ousting of her hoax.\n\nApple Cider Vinegar has done an incredible job recreating this account and breathing life back into the deleted content.\n\nWhether or not you are already familiar with Gibson's story, Apple Cider Vinegar is a compelling watch. You'll especially love it if you enjoy non-fiction productions that play with ideas of truth such as iTonya, the Tinder Swindler and Inventing Anna.\n\n– Edith Jennifer Hill\n\nBelle Gibson built a 'wellness' empire on a lie about cancer. Apple Cider Vinegar expertly unravels her con\n\nStan (Australia), TVNZ+ (New Zealand)\n\nStan's new series Invisible Boys follows four young gay men as they understand and explore their identities while living in Geraldton, a regional town in Western Australia.\n\nCharlie Roth (Joseph Zada), Zeke Calogero (Aydan Calafiore), Kade“Hammer” Hammersmith (Zach Blampied) and Matt Jones (Joe Klocek) represent four very different young men. Yet they share the experience of feeling invisible because of their sexuality.\n\nAn adaptation of Holden Sheppard's novel of the same name, the story challenges linear narratives of progress and typical ideals of queer life . It also shows how such mentalities can lead gay and bisexual men growing up in regional Australia to feel invisible, as they often don't fit the neat narratives associated with“progress”.\n\nNo previous teen drama has been quite as truthful in its representation of some young gay and bisexual men's experiences.\n\nAs someone who grew up gay in regional Australia, it feels like an authentic representation of my own experience. There's something universal about Charlie, Zeke, Kade and Matt's stories of not fitting in, and of being invisible to be safe.\n\nMost striking is the way the series captures the complicated mix of joy and fear – the clash of opportunity and consequence – that accompanies becoming visibly gay in these environments.\n\n– Damien O'Meara\n\nStan's Invisible Boys carries the tradition of real, gritty Aussie teen drama, while smashing it into something new\n\n“Motherhood,” the beleaguered stay-at-home mother of Nightbitch tells us in contemplative voice-over,“is probably the most violent experience a human can have aside from death itself”.\n\nThe film sets out to show motherhood is also far more savage and feral than the anodyne images posted on social media by retrograde tradwives or mumfluencers would have us believe.\n\nAs Nightbitch puts it, it's“fucking brutal”.\n\nMother (Amy Adams) is an unnamed installation artist who places her career on hold to raise her young son. Wrung out by the demands of motherhood and increasingly furious with the lack of support she receives from her incompetent and often absent Husband (Scoot McNairy), Mother starts to spiral out of control, morphing into a dog complete with tail, sharpened canines, extra nipples and a ravenous desire for raw meat.\n\nNightbitch takes the fear of the reproductive woman literally, drawing on magic realism and horror tropes to show the visceral and psychological metamorphosis women undergo on becoming mothers. Unfortunately director Marielle Heller's refusal to lean into the body horror results in a neutered narrative with more bark than bite.\n\n– Rachel Williamson\n\nA new wave of filmmakers are exploring motherhood's discontents.

Cliff Bentz, stood before a town hall of more than 400 of his constituents in deeply red eastern Oregon and faced a barrage of jeers. Many attendees were upset with the first month of cuts by the Trump administration and Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, as well as Bentz’s staunch defense of them.\n\nBentz’s town halls have typically been relatively docile affairs, but not this time. While many 2nd Congressional District constituents who unleashed on the third-term member of Congress at town halls in La Grande, Baker City, Boardman and Pendleton were Democrats, a quieter and less animated portion of the crowds appeared to be worried Republicans.\n\nEmotions are running high because cuts to federal employment, grants and social welfare programs threaten to run deep in rural Oregon. Compared to Oregon’s population centers, incomes are lower in eastern and southern parts of the state, where federal dollars have an outsized impact. And with President Donald Trump back in office and shaking up government like never before, some loyal Republicans living in Trump strongholds are feeling shell shocked. \n\nTurnout to question Bentz at a series of recent town halls was as much as five times the usual. “You’re just rolling over and you’re OK with that?” and “You should be ashamed!” yelled people at a Feb. 19 La Grande gathering. Howls of protest were so frequent that the otherwise unflappable lawmaker reached a breaking point. \n\n“If you just came here to yell, I can leave — do you want me to do that?” Bentz asked the crowd. \n\nLater, in another apparent attempt to calm attendees, Bentz reminded them that at least he was willing to show up and take the heat. “I’ll just say many of my (Republican) colleagues are not doing town halls,” he added.\n\nBentz is one of a league of Republican representatives across the nation who received a verbal lashing in their overwhelmingly conservative districts during their first town halls since Trump retook office. \n\nTrump’s efforts to slash $2 trillion from the federal budget while instituting $4.5 trillion in tax breaks that disproportionately benefit the rich have been supported by the majority-Republican Congress and significant numbers of Republican voters who believe the cutting is necessary. \n\nBut the way Trump is pushing for change has left GOP lawmakers torn between their instincts to protect their constituents and their loyalty to the president. It’s also drawn criticism from the left that Trump’s actions ignore the Constitution, which says the power of the purse lies with Congress.\n\nThe end result has left many rural Oregonians unsettled over the turmoil that’s unfolding in their communities.\n\nMore so than in Portland, Corvallis, Hood River and other Democratic strongholds, residents in Bentz’s vast rural Oregon district depend on Medicaid and food assistance, money to prevent and battle wildfires, programs to boost farmers through purchasing wheat for poor countries and grants to upgrade infrastructure like high-speed internet coverage across vast expanses.\n\nOfficials also have said as many as 10% of the state’s nearly 30,000 federal employees already have received termination notices. That includes Forest Service workers, Veterans Affairs staffers, Bureau of Land Management managers, scientists across multiple agencies and Bonneville Power Administration employees, who ensure that the region’s power grid doesn’t fail. \n\nAnd those cullings could have greater consequences on rural Oregon, where good-paying jobs are tough to come by. An Oregon Employment Department report released Wednesday shows federal employment pays significantly more than the average salary in almost every rural county in the state. In Wasco County, the average federal worker makes $106,000 a year, double the average wage and the largest difference in the state.\n\nThe city council and mayor of the tiny Gilliam County town of Condon, three hours east of Portland, penned a letter on Feb. 20 to members of Congress outlining multiple concerns about the potential loss of federal jobs and grant money.\n\n“I see it as a double-edged sword,” Mayor Dustan Hall, a Republican who voted for Trump, told The Oregonian/OregonLive. “We all want accountability. Where are our tax dollars going? Is this just an open checkbook?” … But at the same time, speaking for Condon, we’re a small rural geographical area that is dependent on grants.”\n\nHall said potential cuts could ravage his 700-resident town, in a county where Trump defeated Democratic opponent Kamala Harris by a more than two-to-one margin. City leaders are anxious about all that is on the line, including jobs at the local U.S. Department of Agriculture office that supports area farmers and the Head Start program for preschoolers from low-income families. \n\nAlready, Hall said, the city learned in early February that a $137,000 federal grant that the local fire district secured last August has been frozen. The grant is supposed to pay for a large grass-and-brush mower that would create burn-resistant fire lines to help prevent the city from going up in flames.\n\n“I speak for all the rural areas — wildfires in Oregon have just been problematic these past few years,” Hall said. “And I fear it’s only going to get worse before it gets better.”\n\nOregon suffered the worst wildfire season in modern state history last year, when six mega fires of more than 100,000 acres destroyed forests, ranches, livestock and a small number of homes and structures alike. All were in rural Oregon.\n\nHall is the rare Trump voter willing to publicly express any degree of concern. \n\nMuch more common is a rural registered Republican who told The Oregonian/OregonLive, her voice shaking in anger, that she feels betrayed by Congress’ willingness to go along with the Trump administration’s looming cuts. The woman, who asked not to be named for fear of repercussions, said she worries Trump’s reductions will devastate a swath of low-income people in her county, Malheur. It has the second-lowest median household income in the state, at about $50,000, and Trump sailed to victory there with 70% of the vote.\n\nHer views, she said, would not go over well if widely known.\n\n“We’re a small town,” the woman said. “Everybody knows everybody. I just want to keep me as safe as possible. I know that sounds so bad. But it’s where I live.”\n\nRural Democrats, however, are speaking out with new energy since they fell into a stunned silence after the November election, said Terrie Martin, a Medford resident and one of the leaders of the progressive activist group Oregon District 2 Indivisible.\n\nMartin said her group held a meeting for new members in left-leaning Ashland in January, around the time of Trump’s inauguration, and 70 people attended. One month later, the group held another new membership meeting 20 minutes away in right-leaning Medford and 250 showed.\n\n“At this one, their hair was on fire,” Martin said of new members who have been jolted into action by Trump’s executive orders and Musk’s leadership of DOGE. Interest, Martin said, “has exploded.”\n\nDuring a “Not My President” President’s Day protest in Medford organized by the group 50501 and heavily attended by District 2 Indivisible members, the crowd of more than 150 waved signs that read “Dump Trump” and “Elon Musk is a terrible president.” They marched to Bentz’s southern Oregon district office with a life-sized cardboard cutout of him plastered in sticky notes with similar messages. A picture they posted to Facebook made the national TV news.\n\nScott Cooper, a lifelong Republican and head of the nonprofit NeighborImpact assisting 60,000 poor or working class residents across three counties in central Oregon, notes that nearly three-quarters of the voters in the county he lives in, Crook, voted for Trump. That includes many of the people his nonprofit helps with child care, food, utility bills and weatherizing homes, he said.\n\nBut he said the Trump administration’s and Congress’ plans to cut trillions could cast the people that NeighborImpact helps into even more dire circumstances. \n\n“If they get a small savings on their taxes, it won’t offset Mom no longer having a payor for her assisted living facility or losing your health care or losing your ability to access a food bank,” Cooper said.\n\nHe said many of the area’s rural residents don’t believe the reductions could harm them. But he is worried enough that he’s flying to Washington, D.C., Sunday to lobby members of Congress.\n\n“Those decisions are going to target the working class, which is hurting and very angry,” Cooper said. “And we’re about to make them hurt more and probably make them angrier.”\n\nAnother Republican and resident of Prineville, Mayor Jason Beebe, said concerns over deep and damaging cuts to rural Oregonians that he’s heard so far have been overblown. Beebe said although he’s privately heard from a few Republicans who are worried about Musk’s job slashing or potential cuts to Medicaid or Medicare, he believes Democrats have been using “scare tactics” that push constituents to complain to the representatives and senators at town halls and other venues. \n\n“I hate the fact that partisan politics pits Americans against each other,” Beebe said. “You have one side saying ‘this’ and the other side saying ‘no.’ And then we don’t know the truth until months later.”\n\nFor instance, Beebe, a disabled veteran who served in Iraq, said he has heard gloom and doom about cuts to Veterans Affairs’ staffing. But so far, his benefits have been untouched.\n\nHe said Oregonians need to give the Trump administration and Musk time to right the course, and if mistakes are made along the way, they will be corrected. He welcomes the purse-tightening as a necessity.\n\n“As a local mayor, I have to watch my budget at home and make sure I don’t go over budget,” said Beebe, who ran against Bentz in the 2024 congressional primary but lost. “I think our federal government should do the same thing.”\n\nEven if the cutting does hit home, Sherman County wheat farmer Rob Simantel said he’s willing to take the hit. Simantel, a Republican, said tens of thousands of dollars worth of federal grants for sustainable farming practices that he receives each year are in jeopardy under the Trump administration’s funding freezes. But he said he has faith that Trump will make the country leaner and the economy healthier. He believes wheat prices, too, will increase again, as they did during Trump’s first administration.\n\n“It may hurt us here in the next year or so, but I think in the long run a lot of the programs will come back and we’ll be stronger.” \n\nIf Trump fails, Oregonians and voters nationwide can vote his Republican supporters in Congress down and elect a Democratic president with a completely different approach, Simantel notes.\n\n“He’s trying to do something, so see what he does — at least give him a little bit of time,” Simantel said. “Somebody has got to be the bad guy and turn it all around.”\n\n— Aimee Green is covering the Oregon Legislature this session.

Here’s Which Actions Mattered Most.","text":"Since his inauguration, President Trump has exploited the fact that it’s hard for Americans to keep up with his actions: they are coming so fast and on so many fronts. What mattered most? What has had a significant impact on the nation and the world? \n\nTimes Opinion asked 10 columnists and regular contributors to assess Trump’s moves in February to dismantle the state, end Russia’s war on Ukraine, attack the justice system and military leaders and push radical executive orders. The list is by no means exhaustive; the intent is to spotlight the most consequential actions and analyze the results. \n\nNick Kristof: Friday’s shouting match in the Oval between Trump and Vladimir Zelensky underscored that the White House is now largely siding with the Kremlin. We seem to be abandoning not only Ukraine but also our principles and legacy. This is not just about Ukraine; it is about ending the postwar international order. Trump is neutering NATO and no longer standing with Europe against Moscow. And by showing that invaders will be forgiven, Trump increases the risk that China makes a move on Taiwan and starts a conflict that becomes a world war. \n\nDavid French: Trump’s decision to essentially switch sides upends the world order, rewards Russian aggression and makes America less safe. If he truly does fracture the Western alliance, then he is planting the seeds for World War III. \n\nMegan Stack: It gives me no pleasure to say this, but Ukraine has already, in effect, lost the war. The important thing now is to stop the killing. Trump is correct about that. He’s also correct in finally saying aloud what has been obvious all along – that Ukraine has little chance of joining NATO. Unfortunately, Trump being Trump, he’s attempting to make peace in the ugliest possible way. Demanding Ukraine’s minerals is naked 19th-century-style imperialism. Subjecting Zelensky to a degrading scene in the Oval Office, dressing him down for insufficient gratitude as if he were a child, suggests contempt for Ukraine itself. (Zelensky had, in fact, thanked Trump earlier in the same discussion.) It remains to be seen whether Trump will let the two sides’ deteriorating armies “fight it out,” as he threatened on Friday. \n\nRoss Douthat: Trump’s first term often featured indefensible rhetoric joined to fairly normal policy outcomes. The possibility of an armistice close to the current lines of battle, with Europe bearing more burdens for maintaining the peace, might be similar to what a Kamala Harris administration might have accepted – notwithstanding Trump’s blame-Ukraine commentary and, now, public Oval Office fights with Ukraine’s president. But those fights are almost certainly making such a peace harder to achieve. \n\nBen Rhodes: Trump has left Ukraine and Europe vulnerable to aggression, flashed a green light to other would-be aggressors from East Asia to the Middle East, and abandoned the community of democracies in favor of a transactional world of autocratic powers making deals over the heads of everyone else — the very dynamic which led to the two world wars that caused us to build alliances, international laws and norms in the first place. The sad spectacle in the Oval Office in which Trump and his vice president repeatedly insulted Zelensky and fully embraced the Kremlin’s view of the war only solidified what has become clear: This is not simply a shift in policies or priorities. The U.S. is no longer a part of the free world in our foreign policy. \n\nDavid Brooks: The “DOGE boys” are mostly incompetent, so the fiscal effect will probably be tiny, but they are unleashing a reign of terror and intimidation that will affect the psychology of all federal workers. \n\nTressie McMillan Cottom: The mass firings are deregulation without democratic governance. Getting away with it is a template for the private sector after a decade of historic (but moderate) labor gains in this country. \n\nDaniel McCarthy: Elon Musk’s project will realize its full potential if it succeeds in auditing the Pentagon and curtailing waste, fraud, abuse and counterproductive spending in the department that represents the single largest slice of discretionary spending in the federal budget. \n\nGail Collins: Well, government efficiency sounds like a great thing unless you’re defining it as eliminating all the things Musk doesn’t like. \n\nStack: The insertion of Musk and DOGE into all corners of our government is the most ominous illegal development of the Trump administration. I can’t think of a historical precedent for letting a White House-backed oligarch pillage our private information, usurp congressional spending power, and gleefully ignore the courts. It’s not clear to me how we’ll resume normal function if Musk proves that our institutions can be so easily compromised. \n\nRhodes: Beyond the immediate cruelty and harm done to affected workers, the chaotic and punitive dismantling of the federal government by a self-interested oligarch is going to severely hurt untold numbers of Americans and deprive the country of indispensable capabilities that could take at least a generation to rebuild. \n\nDouthat: Musk is often underestimated while he’s in the midst of some careening and chaotic institutional ride, only to triumph or at least emerge less than scathed at the end of it. But with that important caveat, the DOGE effort to date seems generally capricious, often counterproductive and possibly politically toxic, no matter what efficiencies it might be finding. \n\nDouthat: The China tariffs are defensible, but the wider policy has a lot more bluster than substance so far, and it’s unsettling markets and displeasing voters for the sake of minimal returns. \n\nCollins: Mix together high tariffs and trade wars with a drop in immigrant workers and a visit to your grocery becomes a nightmare. \n\nBrooks: If you ever get seduced into thinking tariffs are not terrible, remember the point the economist Doug Irwin makes: A tax on imports is a tax on exports. If you block foreigners from selling their goods in America, you are denying them the dollars they would need to buy American goods for their own consumption. You are imposing an inflationary tax that drives down exports — which is crazy. \n\nMatthew Schmitz: Raising international trade barriers while cutting regulations and promoting cheap, reliable energy is necessary if the United States hopes to counter China and achieve broad prosperity. \n\nMcMillan Cottom: Trump is using tariffs to intimidate our economic competitors. It’s proven to allies that American foreign policy will be fickle and brutal under this administration. That could produce bigger problems for Americans, from high prices to being ruled by an imperial president. \n\nFrench: Trump’s approach to immigration has been both malicious and incompetent. He’s rejected a border bill that would bring much-needed asylum reform and has instead embraced executive actions that have had the effect of creating deportation theater without actually increasing deportations. In Trump’s first month he deported thousands fewer undocumented immigrants than Biden did in an average month in the last year of his term. Trump is casting fear in the hearts of immigrants who should be able to stay (including Dreamers) without making a single change so far that will ease the long-term crisis at the border. \n\nSchmitz: Trump has reduced border crossings and reached deals with Latin American countries to aid in deportations, signs that he fully intends to deliver on his campaign promises. \n\nDouthat: A swift collapse in those crossings, joined to a deportation policy that’s substantial but not yet sweeping enough to generate backlash, is probably the political and policy sweet spot for this administration. \n\nBrooks: Even if Congress appropriates $300 billion to build a deportation infrastructure, I’m skeptical the administration can get it up and running during the bulk of Trump’s term. Right now, we just don’t have the facilities and people to do the horrible things Trump is proposing. \n\nKristof: I doubt Trump will achieve the harshness that he aspires to. Despite well-publicized raids, he is so far deporting fewer people than Biden. \n\nStack: Without undocumented immigrants, the United States would be driving off an economic and demographic cliff. Statistically, immigrants are far less likely to commit crime than native-born Americans, and violent crime is trending downward, both nationally and in cities where asylum seekers and migrants are concentrated. We should be talking about a Reagan-style amnesty for undocumented workers – not a mass deportation. \n\nDouthat: This is the Trumpian version of the “abundance agenda” championed by a number of centrist wonks, and it holds more promise for the American economy than anything else he’s doing so far — but it’s much too soon to judge its impact. \n\nStack: Put simply, deregulation is good for powerful corporations, and bad for you and your kids. Federal regulations safeguard clean air and drinkable water, protect consumers, reduce financial scams, and restrain the privacy-invading, mind-numbing excesses of the tech industry. Deregulation means it’s open season, and we’re the prey. \n\nCollins: Drill, baby, drill. Forget the environment; bring down oil prices and just hope you’re not around to breathe in the consequences. \n\nMcMillan Cottom: Deregulation by administrative force is the big story of the first 100 days. It will reshape America for generations. \n\nBrooks: Laws like the National Environmental Policy Act, signed into law in 1970, have slowed economic growth, driven up costs and weakened productivity. Trump is right to deregulate. \n\nFrench: American aid might be a small part of our budget, but it represents a significant portion of our soft power. And beyond the national security implications, acting to ease human suffering abroad speaks to our national character. Trump is making America a more callous and uncaring nation. \n\nKristof: Hundreds of thousands of children could die of malnutrition or malaria, or may be born with H.I.V., because of the reckless dismantling of America’s foreign aid programs. Sudan’s famines will worsen, bird flu surveillance will be diminished, and it will take years to reassemble programs that have been destroyed. \n\nMcCarthy: Ending foreign aid as we know it is a great accomplishment. Not a dime disappears from the world as a result — the money simply goes to more constitutionally appropriate domestic uses or back to taxpayers, who can make their own decisions about how to help the needy in other nations. Far from buying good will, foreign aid generated suspicion and resentment of Washington’s motives and leverage. \n\nMcMillan Cottom: The aggressive dismantling of an anodyne federal agency signaled the beginning of a messaging war on the American psyche. Trump’s No. 1 enemy this time around is the very idea of government. Shock, demoralization, chaos — all ways to describe the intentional destabilization of political and cultural norms in this country. \n\nBrooks: This is a stain on the soul of America. We should all feel shame about what America now stands for. \n\nDouthat: There is always waste at the Pentagon, but given the threats the U.S. faces at the moment, serious budget cuts seem like a bad idea. And while you could reasonably argue, given our struggles in Afghanistan and Iraq, that not enough generals have been fired over the last two decades, there’s no reason to think the president is selecting for competence rather than just loyalty. \n\nKristof: Trump is politicizing America’s military and may attempt to use it more domestically, and he is also weakening it, reducing deterrence. \n\nCollins: Don’t necessarily hate the idea if it’s done intelligently — do you? Until we start thinking about remaking the defense system in the image of Trump and Musk. \n\nMcMillan Cottom: This is a controversial take. As a canary in the coal mine, Trump’s demonization of D.E.I is hugely consequential. It helped the president cobble together a winning coalition of strange bedfellows. However, D.E.I’s power is inextricably tied to the health of the federal labor market and educational institutions. That makes it less critical than the DOGE-led gutting of government workers and cancellation of critical grants. And while the science on D.E.I. economic and social returns are generally positive, there are enough mixed results on how it is institutionalized for this not to be a total negative. D.E.I. is not keeping me up at night. \n\nSchmitz: Opposition to D.E.I. may have become a right-wing crusade, but even in deep-blue California, an affirmative-action referendum was rejected in 2020. By repealing affirmative-action mandates such as Lyndon Johnson’s Executive Order 11246 and scrutinizing forms of discrimination justified in the name of diversity, Trump is delivering what many voters want: equal treatment rather than group preferences aimed at addressing historic disparities. \n\nMcCarthy: Trump is right to eliminate race-based government programs and defund institutions of higher education that engage in racial discrimination for any reason. The administration is restoring sanity by treating sex as a biological reality with public-policy implications and race as an ideological category that does not justify unequal treatment of citizens. \n\nCollins: Well, many reasonable conservatives argue that the programs to spur diversity, equity and inclusion are cumbersome and unfair. But there’s no chance the current administration is going to change them in any way that isn’t doubly unfair and mean-spirited. \n\nStack: In terms of the immediate daily reality in Gaza itself, I must concede that things are better under Trump: There’s a cease-fire and exchanges of captives. But his plan for Gaza – that America should carry out an ethnic cleansing by force and then, like some plundering kingdom, take the land for ourselves – is one big, shameful mess of war crimes. \n\nDouthat: The proposal to “take” Gaza is a daft and terrible idea but the cease-fire and hostage exchange is an improvement on the status quo, so as far as actual policy goes Trump gets (very, very ...) provisional credit for a promise kept. \n\nFrench: It is very difficult to determine whether Trump has had any real impact on the Middle Eastern conflict so far. His bluster is indefensible, but his impact is debatable. \n\nSchmitz: Trump deserves praise for the cease-fire, but not a single American soldier should be sent to Gaza. \n\nKristof: Trump has proposed what amounts to ethnic cleansing for Gaza, but it won’t happen, and Middle East peace will remain elusive. \n\nMcMillan Cottom: This is a mashup of Trump’s most dangerous strategies. Anti-truth. Anti-science. Cronyism. Retribution. Demoralization. Deregulation. Empowering Kennedy to lead the nation’s health apparatus could kill people and could kill industries that save people. Above all, democracy requires a healthy citizenry. This matters. \n\nKristof: If we face a highly lethal variant of avian flu that Kennedy bungles the response to, all Americans will be at risk. \n\nCollins: Our new secretary of health and human services has been downplaying his anti-vaccine crusades. Hey, maybe he’ll do a better job than we imagine. Although I guarantee you something’s going to happen that will make us revisit the worm-in-the-brain stories. \n\nStack: It’s mind-blowing that, in the year of our Lord 2025, the president has declared that an entire cohort of people simply do not exist. The outsized and outstandingly cruel obsession with transgender Americans – a small, vulnerable minority already targeted with disproportionate violence – is blatant scapegoating, and a serious overreach on the part of the federal government. I can’t say it’s exactly consequential, since so few lives are materially affected (which is kind of my point) but it is a shameful mark on our national conscience. \n\nSchmitz: In the wake of Kamala Harris’s loss, the Democratic congressmen Seth Moulton and Tom Suozzi urged their party to reassess its support for transgender athletes in women’s sports. They recognized the importance of an issue that many wave away as a mere distraction of the culture war. \n\nFrench: Malice against transgender Americans is inexcusable, but there is a need for common sense. Biological males should not compete in women’s sports, for example, and federal educational policy should make that clear. \n\nMcMillan Cottom: This is red-meat content for Trump’s culture warriors. It is scary for transgender people, the people who love them, and anyone who cares about human rights. Trump cannot mandate a biological question. He can empower citizens and the authorities to surveil people. This is a real danger. But, ultimately, this is beyond his authority; renegade gender policing has already operated without any real legal authority. It will continue to do so, whatever Trump declares. \n\nRhodes: With his remaking of the Department of Justice and F.B.I. into a vehicle for his personal political interests, Trump has crossed a Rubicon. Once justice ceases to be impartial, it may be harder than Americans think to return to a system in which justice is apolitical, fair and impartial. \n\nMcMillan Cottom: The consequences could be huge but at the moment most of them are still hypotheticals. Trump’s overt application of power is hugely negative and consequential for how he intends to use that power. As a test of the judiciary, this could be more severely negative. \n\nBrooks: These numbers will worsen if Trump completely politicizes the D.O.J., but so far it’s too soon to tell. \n\nCollins: A very depressing morality play.","summary":"From DOGE to Ukraine to the Eric Adams case, these are the most consequential actions by the new administration so far.","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/01/opinion/trump-administration-first-month.html","image":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/01/opinion/01trump-report-card/01trump-report-card-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-02 13:49:10","author":"New York Times Opinion","authors":["New York Times Opinion"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.131},{"id":295895598,"title":"General Services Administration shutters its technology unit","text":"As part of the Trump administration's ongoing efforts to shrink the federal workforce, the General Services Administration eliminated its technology unit, CBS News learned Saturday. The GSA's tech unit, known as the 18F office, employed a team of researchers, website designers and product managers. It's unclear exactly how many workers were impacted. The office was responsible for helping build the Internal Revenue Service's free tax-filing service and updating other government agency websites. GSA Administrator Thomas Shedd announced the elimination of 18F in an internal email that was sent early Saturday morning. In it, Shedd wrote that the team had been identified as \"non-critical,\" and that the cuts had been made \"in alignment with the President's Workforce Optimization EO and the recent memo from GSA per the Trump Administration requiring cutting 'non-essential consulting' functions.\" \"The decision was made with explicit direction from the top levels of leadership within both the Administration and GSA,\" the message read. Shedd added that \"we anticipate more change in the future.\" The official website for the 18F office was taken offline Saturday. The GSA, first established in 1949, has about 12,000 employees and is tasked with a wide range of support services for other government agencies, such as managing office space and real estate, acquiring supplies and overseeing digital technology. Among its responsibilities is assisting with presidential transitions. After Mr. Trump won the November election, however, his transition team refused to sign a memorandum of understanding with the GSA as had been done by both Republicans and Democrats in previous transitions. That agreement allows for office space, secure email addresses and funding for transition staffing and other activities to be provided by GSA. Billionaire Elon Musk, who is leading the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, has been charged by President Trump with reducing federal spending, a process which has so far involved laying off thousands of workers across the government. In a social media post Saturday, billionaire Mark Cuban, who campaigned for former Vice President Kamala Harris last year and has been critical of Mr. Trump, wrote that if \"you worked for 18F and got fired, Group together to start a consulting company.\" \"It's just a matter of time before DOGE needs you to fix the mess they inevitably create,\" Cuban added. \"They will have to hire your company as a contractor to fix it. But on your terms.

The new Trump book by the author of three other bestsellers “is a total FAKE JOB, just like the other JUNK he wrote”, the 47th president posted after the first revelations from Wolff’s work broke. “I assume … he was able to speak to a small number of people, but not meaningfully.”\n\nOnce again, Wolff has poured a samovar of scalding tea on Trump’s lap.\n\nFire and Fury was released in January 2018 and sold millions, despite Trump’s attempt to block its publication. Siege and Landslide followed. Wolff’s interview with Trump in 2021, for Landslide, remains memorable for its descriptions of place and people as much as for Trump’s usual invective. From Mar-a-Lago, Wolff wrote of “blond mothers and blond daughters, infinitely buxom”, traipsing through the lobby of a palace built to cater to its creator’s sensibilities.\n\nFour years later, All or Nothing is the first major work about Trump’s re-election to drop since the inauguration. Wolff rains on Trump’s parade, offering a breezy but disturbing read about how Trump willed his way back to power and captured a plurality of the electorate.\n\nLike many of us, Wolff stands simultaneously mesmerized and disdainful.\n\nTrump’s rage toward Wolff is at least understandable. In the run-up to the last election, Wolff released tapes in which the late financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein appeared to detail close social ties with Trump, a relationship the president has long denied. Now, on the page, Wolff paints a dismal picture of Trump’s third marriage. “She fucking hates him,” a “Mar-a-Lago patio confidant” tells Wolff of Melania Trump. “She had not enjoyed a single day in the White House. To the extent that they had had a marriage (even on a negotiated footing), it was further disrupted by her husband’s mood swings and constant sense of offense and injury.”\n\nDonald’s 34 criminal convictions for paying the porn star Stormy Daniels to keep quiet about her claimed affair can’t have helped.\n\nBetween Trump and his daughter Ivanka, and Jared Kushner, her husband, Wolff depicts a dance of ambitions and expectations.\n\n“Kushner’s own clear and immediate post-White House plan was to put distance between himself and his father-in-law,” Wolff writes, of Jared and Ivanka’s flight from Trump’s side after 6 January 2021 and the attack on Congress. The couple decamped to Miami, not Palm Beach, rather than be part of Trump’s daily orbit. “Asked about his father-in-law’s future by a friend, Kushner replied early on, ‘What was Nixon’s future?’”\n\nRichard Nixon never enjoyed a second act. It seemed Trump would not either.\n\nAccording to Wolff, in the aftermath of 7 October 2023, and Hamas’s attack on Israel, Kushner was asked to help swat down a Washington Post investigation on Trump and allegations of antisemitism. “No, Ivanka and I aren’t going to do that,” Jared reportedly said. “We’re not going to go and put our names on something and get in the middle of things. That’s just not what we’re going to do this time.” A spokesperson for Kushner and the White House characterized Wolff’s reporting as false.\n\nIn his first term, Trump pardoned Charles Kushner, Jared’s father. This year, Trump nominated Kushner Sr to be ambassador to France and Monaco. Gratitude means many things.\n\nAll or Nothing also scrutinizes Todd Blanche, Trump’s personal lawyer and pick for deputy attorney general. “In private, Trump liked Blanche’s certainty and forcefulness,” Wolff writes. “But now, in open court [in the Stormy Daniels hush-money case], with sudden humility, unaccountably weak and deferential, Blanche seems to stumble and suck his words and fill his hesitations with ‘ums.’ (‘POTUS really hates ums,’ says a reproving aide.)”\n\nBlanche whiffed, Trump was convicted. For now, Blanche remains at Trump’s side.\n\nThe White House has pushed back against Wolff – forcefully.\n\n“Michael Wolff is a lying sack of shit and has been proven to be a fraud,” said Steven Cheung, the White House communications director. Irony abounds. Trump entered office as a twice-adjudicated fraudster as well as the first convicted felon to hold the presidency.\n\nWolff reports misogyny and racism too. He captures Trump musing that Michelle Obama would replace Joe Biden on the Democratic ticket in 2024. “People call her ‘Mike,’ you know. You know that, don’t you?” he purportedly said, in a series of telephone monologues. “They think she looks pretty manly. Those very big shoulders. What’s that about? That’s what people will call her if she runs, ‘Mike.’ That’s the name she’ll have: ‘Mike.’”\n\nMichelle Obama refused to attend Trump’s second inauguration.\n\nNor, according to Wolff, could Trump countenance the possibility that Kamala Harris would replace Biden. He saw her as an intellectual lightweight, beneath his contempt. “It won’t be Harris. It’ll never be Harris,” Trump reportedly told the denizens of the Mar-a-Lago patio. In debate prep, Wolff writes, he branded her a “fucking bitch” more than 100 times. Harris won the debate but lost the election. Unlike Hillary Clinton, she also lost the popular vote.\n\nOn the other hand, Wolff says, Trump feared Gretchen Whitmer, the Democratic governor of Michigan. The two had clashed over Covid-19. If it was her, Trump reportedly thought, he was “fucked”.\n\nNow, back in the White House, Trump sits at the center of all news cycles, describing himself as a “king”, watching titans of industry prostrate themselves before him. “But,” Wolff adds, “there is, too, the inescapable fact of his age, term limits, second-term malaise, and his lame-duck status – power ebbs.\n\n“At some point, as hard as it might seem to imagine, events will have a life of their own without Donald Trump at the center of them. And then the story will end.”\n\nDon’t be so sure. Trump openly speaks of a third term.\n\n All or Nothing: How Trump Recaptured America is published in the US by Penguin Random House","summary":"The president’s least favorite biographer again exposes the grotesque pettiness of Trump as he willed his way back to power\n\n\nDon’t let a billionaire’s algorithm control what you read.

Talk of Anna Claire Howland, 21, and her band of young conservatives first slammed into American public consciousness when New York Magazine splashed an image of a group of glamorous under 30s on its front cover. The headline, ‘The Cruel Kids Table’, fascinated, angered and enthralled – banishing images of the American right wing as fusty old men and conjuring a new picture of health, beauty and vitality. The emergence of the picture, taken at Butterworth’s Bistro in Washington DC, has led to claims – not least from Alabama-raised Howland herself – that the allegiance of the American youth vote is no longer pledged solely to the Democrat party. There may be some truth in this, but polling numbers don’t paint a clear picture. Data collated by Tufts Circle said that Kamala Harris still secured more of the youth vote than Trump, although this was less than joe Biden secured four years before. The vibe of the so-called “Cruel Kids” is monied, one of heritage, all expensive clothes and impressive houses. Howland isn’t faking it for Instagram, either. It has been reported she grew up in a 6,800sq ft mansion and has now spoken out about how she believes that society is crying out for a return to traditional values. Speaking to the Telegraph earlier this month, the Southern Methodist University student said: “I’ve kindly been named the ‘Conservative Princess’, the ‘American It Girl’ and I think it’s because of the way my parents raised me with faith, manners and morals. “I do think that’s what Maga means. The new generation of conservatives in general, I think all have this. “There are seasons of my life where I’m the closest to God, and that’s the happiest I am and so I’ve just really reaped the benefits of Christianity in my life, and I’ve seen God move in my life and others. “We need to bring back tradition, in my opinion, and I think we’re getting that more with Donald Trump . That’s why I support him.” The former chapter president for the Gamma Phi Chapter of Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority at the university’s online presence has connected with masses of people online with over 18k followers on Instagram and 5k on TikTok . The magazine cover that sprung Howland into the limelight has caused a fair bit of backlash. Howland has hit back at the article, which made claims about the guests at the party to celebrate the inauguration of Trump. Debate has since roared, with people affiliated with the image criticising the magazine for implying that only people at the party were white, claiming that image used was cropped with intent to tell a particular story.","summary":"‘The Cruel Kids Table’ fascinated, angered and enthralled, banishing images of the American right wing as fusty old men and conjuring a new picture of health, beauty and vitality","url":"https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/us-news/meet-striking-donald-trump-lover-34763092","image":"https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/article34763171.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/1_JS360517182_Main.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-02 12:00:00","author":"Harry Thompson","authors":["Harry Thompson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.09},{"id":295918324,"title":"Trump forces Democrats into defending the indefensible","text":"Tomasky was right. In his first term, Trump was undisciplined, impulsive, reactive rather than strategic, and politically naive. He underestimated the complexities of Washington and, at least initially, failed to recognize the dangers surrounding him. Eight years later, Trump’s eyes are wide open. He knows whom to trust and avoid. He is surrounded by a fiercely loyal team of Cabinet members, advisers, and staffers. His actions are deliberate. He is firmly in control.\n\nMost notably, he has developed an invaluable new skill: a remarkable ability to force the Democratic Party into defending the most indefensible positions. \n\nWe saw glimpses of this during the campaign. Then-Vice President Kamala Harris was forced to justify her administration’s open border policy, its support for gender-affirming procedures for minors, and allowing biological males to compete in women’s sports alongside a host of other radical positions.\n\nTrump has now compelled Democrats to defend the most egregious position of all — opposition to a comprehensive audit of the U.S. government. Cutting waste and fraud from the bloated, out-of-control federal budget is something that everyone should applaud, yet Democrats have gone to extraordinary lengths to block the Department of Government Efficiency from fulfilling its mission. \n\nElon Musk and his team of 20-something tech wizards have already uncovered at least $65 billion worth of waste, and most are delighted. A Harvard-Harris poll released Monday found that 76% of respondents supported “a full-scale effort to find and eliminate fraud and waste in government expenditures.” In other words, they like what DOGE is doing.\n\nAside from Trump’s decision to rename the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America, which garnered only 39% support, the vast majority of those polled back Trump’s agenda. Support ranged from 57% for ending bans on offshore drilling to 81% for deporting illegal immigrants who have committed crimes.\n\nAt any rate, Democrats are scrambling to defend their opposition to the DOGE audit — and they’re pulling out all the stops. Their first line of defense has been enlisting federal judges to block DOGE team members from accessing agency records. Last week, they added another tactic to their playbook: astroturfing, a powerful political strategy to shape and manipulate public opinion. Their goal is to push the narrative that even Republicans are turning against DOGE.\n\nTo that end, party operatives masquerading as outraged Republican constituents showed up at several House Republican town halls and staged protests outside district offices to denounce their support for DOGE. Though these demonstrations were intended to appear as organic, grassroots uprisings, they were meticulously planned. As expected, the legacy media, in its capacity as the public relations arm of the Democratic Party, seized on these staged protests, falsely reporting that opposition to DOGE was now taking root among Republicans.\n\nOn the Friday evening edition of Fox News’s The Five, the show’s lone Democrat, Jessica Tarlov, claimed that many people who voted for Trump were now experiencing buyer’s remorse. Citing the protests that had disrupted Republican town halls the night before, she said: “So [Republicans] Rich McCormick in Georgia — safe seat — people booing him, catcalling, they’re concerned with everything from spending cuts to what’s going on with DOGE to that Donald Trump is becoming a tyrant. Cliff Bentz in Oregon — similar reaction. This guy Tony Balderson — he’s in a Trump +18 district in Ohio — [constituents] saying Trump’s executive orders are getting out of control. They are hearing from the American public that what is going on, from the Oval Office to CPAC … is not what the American public wanted.”\n\nTarlov failed to inform viewers that these protests were generally, if not totally, orchestrated by the Democratic Party. She also neglected to mention that some of the so-called “Republicans” speaking out against DOGE were, in reality, actors sent by the Democratic Party.\n\nUnfortunately for the Democrats, the jig was up on Tuesday. The Washington Free Beacon’s Collin Anderson exposed the charade in an article titled, “Red-District DOGE Protests, Cited As Proof of Broad Musk ‘Backlash,’ Were Organized By Left-Wing Groups.” He revealed, “In one case, a former Dem county board candidate and self-described ‘political activist’ helped organize a viral demonstration in Georgia.” Anderson noted that reporters from the New York Times, Washington Post, and CBS News all drew the same conclusion from the protest at McCormick’s town hall in Georgia: it was “proof of emerging bipartisan ‘backlash’ over Elon Musk’s efforts to slash government spending.”\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM RESTORING AMERICA\n\nSuch wishful thinking came on the heels of Democratic strategist James Carville’s absurd prediction that Trump’s administration would experience a “massive collapse” within 30 days — six weeks at most.\n\nDemocrats can defend the indefensible for as long as they want, but voters are starting to catch on.

Over 150 Years of History Weighs In.","text":"In October, Wall Street's bull market rally celebrated its two-year anniversary, and it's shown little sign of slowing down. Since 2022 came to a close, the ageless Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI 1.39%), widely followed S&P 500 (^GSPC 1.59%), and growth-focused Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC 1.63%) have respectively increased by 31%, 55%, and 82%.\n\nThis rally has been fueled by an assortment of factors, including (in no particular order):\n\nThe rise of artificial intelligence (AI).\nThe resiliency of the U.S. economy.\nInvestor euphoria regarding stock splits in influential businesses.\nBetter than expected corporate earnings.\nA substantial uptick in corporate buybacks.\n\nBut over the last four months, arguably nothing has been more important to the Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite than Donald Trump's November victory and subsequent return to the White House. During Trump's first term in office, the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq catapulted higher by 57%, 70%, and 142%, respectively. To say that investors are looking for an encore would be an understatement.\n\nThe optimism that accompanies Trump's second term has to do with the belief that he'll seek to lower the peak marginal corporate income tax rate and foster deregulation. The former is likely to inspire record share repurchases from S&P 500 companies, while the later should encourage dealmaking and bring new innovations to market at a faster pace.\n\nWhile the table would appear to be set for additional upside for Wall Street, one historically flawless indicator, which sports more than 150 years of back-tested data, suggests the party may be nearing its end.\n\nHistory suggests President Trump can oversee a sizable stock market decline\n\nThough the expected implementation of tariffs and what they might do to the prevailing rate of inflation has been an early concern of Trump's second term, there's a far bigger fish in the pond -- and it has nothing to do with Trump's various proposals.\n\nThe indicator that foretells of trouble to come for Wall Street is none other than the S&P 500's Shiller price-to-earnings (P/E) Ratio, which is also known as the cyclically adjusted P/E Ratio (CAPE Ratio).\n\nTo get the obvious out of the way, \"value\" is a bit of a subjective term. Since everyone's investment goals and risk tolerance varies, what one investor deems to be expensive might be considered a bargain by another.\n\nMost investors tend to rely on the time-tested P/E ratio as a quick and easy way to decipher if a stock (or the broader market) is relatively cheap or pricey. The P/E ratio, which divides a company's share price by its trailing-12-month earnings per share (EPS), works great for mature businesses, but high-growth companies and recessions/shock events can significantly reduce the reliability of this valuation measure.\n\nMeanwhile, the Shiller P/E Ratio is based on average inflation-adjusted EPS over the last 10 years. By including 10 years' worth of EPS history, it ensures that shock events can't skew it.\n\nS&P 500 Shiller CAPE Ratio data by YCharts.\n\nAlthough the S&P 500's Shiller P/E didn't gain prominence until the late 1990s, it's been back-tested to January 1871. Over this 154-year period, the average multiple is 17.21. As of the closing bell on Feb. 26, the S&P 500's Shiller P/E clocked in at a multiple of 37.55.\n\nTo put the rarity of this reading into perspective, there have only been six instances since 1871, including the present, where the Shiller P/E has surpassed 30 for at least two months. Following each of the previous five instances, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and/or Nasdaq Composite, eventually, declined by 20% to 89%.\n\nIt's worth noting that the Shiller P/E is in no way a timing tool. Whereas crossing above a multiple of 30 resulted in significant downside in a matter of months during the Great Depression, valuations remained extended for more than four years leading up to the dot-com bubble. While there's no rhyme or reason to when stock market corrections begin, the Shiller P/E has a flawless track record of foreshadowing these eventual moves lower.\n\nIn modern times -- i.e., since the internet went mainstream and online trading proliferated three decades ago -- the Shiller P/E's trough during stock market downturns has often been in the neighborhood of 22. A decline from the peak reading of 38.89 during the current bull market to roughly 22 would represent a 43% drop. More importantly, it would result in the benchmark S&P 500 \"crashing\" by approximately 40% from its all-time high.\n\nThrough no fault of his own -- we'd be having this same discussion if Kamala Harris was victorious in November -- President Donald Trump may oversee a valuation-driven 40% plunge in stocks.\n\nThankfully, stock market cycles aren't linear\n\nWhile the prospect of a bear market decline or stock market crash may not sit well with investors, perspective can change everything on Wall Street.\n\nTruth be told, stock market corrections, bear markets, and even crashes are a normal, healthy, and inevitable part of the investing cycle. No amount of fiscal or monetary policy changes, or well-wishing from the investment community, can stop downturns from cropping up from time to time.\n\nWhat investors can take solace in is knowing that stock market boom-and-bust cycles aren't linear.\n\nBack in June 2023, the analysts at Bespoke Investment Group posted a data set on social media platform X that compared the length of every bull and bear market dating to the start of the Great Depression in September 1929. This roughly 94-year history demonstrated the stark contrast between stock market downturns and periods of expansion.\n\nIt's official. A new bull market is confirmed.The S&P 500 is now up 20% from its 10/12/22 closing low. The prior bear market saw the index fall 25.4% over 282 days.Read more at https://t.co/H4p1RcpfIn. pic.twitter.com/tnRz1wdonp\n-- Bespoke (@bespokeinvest) June 8, 2023\n\nOn one side of the coin, the average S&P 500 bear market lasted 286 calendar days, which equates to roughly 9.5 months. On the other hand, the typical bull market for the benchmark index stuck around for 1,011 calendar days, which is roughly two years and nine months (around 3.5 times longer than the average bear market).\n\nFurthermore, no bear market in 94 years endured longer than 630 calendar days. In comparison, 14 out of 27 S&P 500 bull markets, including the current bull market (when extrapolated to present day), were in place longer than 630 calendar days.\n\nThe ability for investors to take a step back and examine the big picture will show that, while downturns are normal and inevitable, patience is rewarded. According to a back-tested analysis by Crestmont Research, every rolling 20-year period for the S&P 500 since 1900 would have produced a positive total return, including dividends.\n\nRegardless of whether President Trump's second term features another extended bull market run-up or a bear market, history is quite clear that the Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite should be markedly higher 20 years from now.","summary":"A historic marker that's outside of President Trump's control spells trouble for Wall Street.","url":"https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/03/02/will-stock-market-crash-40-president-trump-history/?source=askdougpancakes&utm_source=chromefollow&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=news&referring_guid=35c8cf9c-88ea-41ef-a4bc-7e364458fa70","image":"https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F809238%2F49178332061_bac99d164c_k.jpg&amp;op=resize&amp;w=1200&amp;h=630","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-02 09:06:00","author":"Sean Williams","authors":["Sean Williams"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.343},{"id":295868678,"title":"Jim Fossel: Mills-Trump clash carries high stakes for Maine","text":"A direct confrontation between Gov. Janet Mills and President Donald Trump was not an item I had on my political bingo card for 2025 — or, really, ever — and here we are.\n\nThere were a few reasons to think that this confrontation wouldn’t occur, mainly because, until last week, it seemed as if Trump didn’t much know who Mills was, nor did he care. Indeed, last year Trump referred to Mills as a man in a call with supporters. Unlike in 2016 and 2020, he never did an actual campaign stop in Maine. During his first term as president, he never had much reason to interact with her, either. On his one official visit to the state, he was instead accompanied by former Gov. Paul LePage.\n\nWhen Trump was sworn in as president for the second time, she wasn’t one of the Democratic governors who immediately vowed to resist him at every turn. That was probably politically wise of her, especially if she really is considering running for Senate against Sen. Susan Collins in 2026. While he’s never won the state, Trump has received an Electoral College vote from the 2nd District, so Mills, just like Rep. Jared Golden, doesn’t want to completely alienate all of his supporters.\n\nYet, here we are. What to make of this fight between the White House and the Blaine House over trans athletes in high school sports, a fairly niche policy area that receives outsized attention? While it’s certainly important to those whom it directly affects, it’s not to most Mainers. That’s not simply my judgment, either, but one reflected in polls.\n\nEven the broader issue of LGBTQ rights doesn’t get in the top five issues in polls. The voting public in Maine is, rightly, more concerned about economic issues: cost of living, housing, taxes and inflation, for instance — as am I. I’ve never voted based on any social issues, let alone this one; my views are all over the map in that area.\n\nStill, even if it’s not important to the public as a whole, it’s an important issue to both parties’ ideological base. For Trump, going after Mills on this keeps his voters engaged politically, both in Maine and nationally. It also distracts them from other things he’s done with which they may not agree — like threatening Canada with tariffs.\n\nFor Mills, even if she might not have sought it out, this confrontation will help solidify her position with the liberal base, but that’s probably not something she really needed to worry about very much. In 2022, she did better nearly everywhere than Kamala Harris did in 2024, showing that she has strong standing with voters across the ideological spectrum.\n\nHowever, it could potentially have a very real downside for her, both politically and in doing her job as governor. While she’s busy making national headlines, back home she’s dealing with fraught negotiations over both the supplemental budget and the biennial budget. She’s proposed a mix of spending cuts and tax increases to deal with the budget shortfall, an approach that is pleasing exactly nobody so far. Picking fights with the White House over this or any other issue isn’t going to endear her to Republicans in Augusta.\n\nAnd this is not just a purely political issue — it’s a fiscal one.\n\nIf the Trump administration cuts off federal education funding to Maine, that would immediately blow a massive hole in the state budget, to the tune of $250 million. If he tried to cut off all federal funding to Maine in response, that would be calamitous. Should he go forward with either step, the state would obviously fight it in the courts, but that can take quite some time — even with issues that require expeditious rulings.\n\nWhile that fight is going on, the Legislature will still be attempting to enact a biennial budget, and that was already going to be a challenge. Without knowing the outcome of a potential court battle, how could it possibly make any assumptions about federal funding?\n\nFor Trump, this is a relatively minor skirmish that will serve as an example of his tenacity to his base and possibly set a legal precedent for other Democratic governors who challenge him. For Mills, though, and for the state of Maine, it’s a monumental and perilous moment, one that could reverberate.","summary":"A minor skirmish for the president has the potential to become calamitous for the governor — and our state.","url":"https://www.centralmaine.com/2025/03/02/jim-fossel-mills-trump-clash-carries-high-stakes-for-maine/","image":"https://w2pcms.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-01-at-10.16.42-PM.jpg?w=446","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-02 09:00:43","author":"Jim Fossel","authors":["Jim Fossel"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.107}]}
