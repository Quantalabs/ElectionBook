During the three-day conference, storytellers attended skills sessions on how to share what happened to them, like one focused on writing a letter to the editor that organizers would then send out to local news organizations.\nHarris, who made abortion rights and access to reproductive care central to her 2024 campaign, didn’t mention Donald Trump by name, but chronicled how the “administration” continues to chip away at reproductive rights.\nSince taking office, Trump signed an executive order aimed at enforcing the Hyde Amendment, which seeks to prevent federal funds from being used to support abortion, spurring the Pentagon to rescind a policy that reimbursed military families for travel to states where abortion and other reproductive health procedures are legal. He signed other orders granting pardons to antiabortion activists who violated a law barring people from physically blocking abortion clinics or threatening patients. And, in April, the administration “paused $27.5 million for organizations that provide family planning, contraception, cancer screenings, and sexually transmitted infection services as it investigates whether they’re complying with the law,” according to the Associated Press.\nCurrently, 19 states ban abortion or restrict the procedure earlier in pregnancy than the standard set by Roe, according to The New York Times—though the state of abortion access across the country is still changing rapidly due to legal battles and zealous antiabortion groups and politicians. ProPublica has found at least five women who’ve died under abortion bans—and advocates say that number is expected to be significantly higher.\n“These bans, these executive actions and funding cuts have intentionally created a health care crisis,” Harris told attendees. “But,” she continued, “we know that the leaders in this room are not going to stand for this.”\nIn a statement to Vanity Fair, Harris said that the day the Dobbs decision came down, when she was sitting vice president, was “devastating.”\n“For the first time, it became clear that young women today will have fewer rights than their mothers and grandmothers,” she continued. “But even in the face of that loss, we keep fighting.”\n“Their voices,” Harris added, referring to the storytellers in DC, “are vital to our nation and to the ongoing fight for reproductive freedom. I’m grateful for their courage, their clarity, and their commitment.”\nThe Dobbs decision, Zurawski said, “feels, to me, like the day the world woke up and started paying attention. Myself included, because I was early pregnant.” Zurawski, who nearly died when a Texas law prevented her from receiving an abortion after her pregnancy became nonviable, has become one of the most prominent abortion storytellers across the nation.\n“Being able to speak out and advocate with my story has been really, really healing and empowering,” she said, “but there are so many people that don’t get that opportunity, and I worry about their grief and their healing and how much longer it might take.”\nZurawski, in March of 2023, became the lead plaintiff in a Texas case filed by the Center for Reproductive Rights that went all the way up to the Supreme Court. In May of 2024, the Court issued its ruling, refusing to clarify exceptions in Texas’s bans and rejecting the claims brought by Zurawski and 19 other plaintiffs who were denied abortions despite dire pregnancy complications.\nKash, whose story spans two years and involves four pregnancies, had her first abortion in October of 2021—several months before Dobbs, but after Texas’ antiabortion law, SB 8, took effect in September of that year. “By the time Dobbs happened, it was already the end of the world,” she told me.\n“So,” Kash continued, “when Dobbs happened, I was just really sad, because I was like, there’s a pregnant person out there who’s going to get a bad diagnosis tomorrow.” As Kash headed out to the Hill, she said she was “fired up,” and it was apparent in each question she answered—angry, assured, ready.\nThis is Cox’s first major event since coming back from maternity leave. Cox publicly announced her pregnancy during the Democratic National Convention’s delegate roll call in August. Less than a year earlier, in December of 2023, she filed a petition for a temporary restraining order that would allow her to terminate her pregnancy. ​​After a complicated, and expedited, legal battle, Cox was forced to leave the state for care.\n“Today feels heavier,” she told me, as Zurawski and Kash listened, nodding. “I wasn’t paying attention when Dobbs happened. I was never someone who thought about abortion. I had my plate full with little ones and going to school.” She continued, “but now the anniversary hits and you really think—I look at my daughter and I think of the world and the rights I want her to have.”","summary":"The former vice president made a surprise visit to a conference of abortion storytellers, whose “voices,” she tells Vanity Fair, “are vital to our nation in the ongoing fight for reproductive freedom.”","url":"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/kamala-harris-recalling-devastating-day-of-dobbs-decision-urges-women-to-keep-fighting","image":"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/685afa8cad3f73925618a04a/16:9/w_2000,h_1125,c_limit/free-and-just-abortion-storytellers-2.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-24 22:55:10","author":"Katie Herchenroeder","authors":["Katie Herchenroeder"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.162},{"id":334863554,"title":"Everything You Need to Know About Donald Trump's New Far-Right, 9/11 Conspiracy Nut, White Nationalist 'First Buddy' Laura Loomer — After We Revealed She's Got Hit-List of His Iran Blitz Critics","text":"Laura Loomer has forced her way into President Trump's life, promising to bring down anyone who dares to push back on his decisions related to Iran, and making enemies of even fellow MAGA fanatics, RadarOnline.com can reveal.\n\nThe 32-year-old has been making noise on social media for years, sharing her wild conspiracy theories and even turning off many ultra-conservatives, including Marjorie Taylor Greene.What's Loomer All About?Loomer, also known as \"Looney\" Loomer by her critics, has worked as an activist and commentator for organizations including Project Veritas and Alex Jones' Infowars. She has also had her name in politics for a few years now, after she unsuccessfully ran for Congress in 2020 and 2022 in South Florida. She also caught flak for staging numerous protests, most notably handcuffing herself to a Twitter office after the platform banned her.\n\nShe also jumped a fence at a home owned by the then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nDespite accompanying Trump on his 9/11 anniversary travels in New York and Pennsylvania in 2024, Loomer is also known for pushing the theory that 9/11 was an \"inside job\" carried out by the US government, and also spouting anti-Muslim rhetoric.\n\n\"I don’t control Laura. Laura has to say what she wants. She’s a free spirit,\" Trump previously said of the far-right nut, claiming he was unaware of her 9/11 comments.'Looney' Loomer's Vile RemarksWhile Trump, 78, was battling to out with Kamala Harris in last year's presidential campaign, Loomer made another disgusting remarking, claiming the \"White House will smell like curry & White House speeches will be facilitated via a call center,\" if Harris were to be elected, alluding to her Indian and Jamaican heritage.\n\nLoomer also said she was \"blacker\" than Harris, which led U.S. Representative Green to call out the comments as \"appalling and extremely racist.\"\n\nIn December 2024, Loomer duked it out with Trump's original \"First Buddy,\" Elon Musk, a native of South Africa, on X over their opposing positions on the use of skilled migration visas.\n\nLoomer claimed visas went against the \"America First\" agenda, which led to her account being temporarily suspended by the platform's owner, Musk.'Loyalty Enforcer'Even with her vile remarks and comments, the \"proud Islamophobe\" has received rave remarks from Trump, who previously labeled her as \"terrific\" and \"very special.\" So, it should come as no surprise that Loomer is now in the former reality star's pocket.\n\nOn Wednesday, Loomer took to X and threw a tantrum over critics, including conservative Candace Owens, criticizing Trump's decision to bomb Iran after promising to keep America out of foreign wars, and even named-dropped Loomer.\n\n\"(Trump) always said since day one of his campaign that he was against Iran having a nuclear weapon,\" she said. \"But, yes, since (Owens) mentioned it, I am screenshotting everyone’s posts and I’m going to deliver them in a package to President Trump so he sees who is truly with him and who isn’t.\"Loomer continued: \"I think by now everyone knows I mean it when I say I’m going to deliver something to Trump.

But, experts reveal, Trump's sneakily changed the course of history","text":"Donald Trump shattered another unwritten presidential rule as he became the first commander-in-chief to deliberately say 'f***' live on TV.\n\nPrevious presidents have reserved such language for private tirades against incompetent cabinet secretaries and obstinate generals, or perhaps while venting to the first lady in the privacy of the East Wing.\n\nBut all that changed on Tuesday as Trump unleased his fury on the South Lawn of the White House. It was 6.37am and he was walking, tieless in the muggy weather, to board his Marine One helicopter for the start of his journey to a NATO summit in The Hague.\n\nLike many of his predecessors the head-spinning frustration of trying to broker peace in the Middle East appeared to have got the better of him.\n\n'They don't know what the f*** they are doing!' Trump yelled over the roar of helicopter blades, emphasizing the 'f***' to make sure the journalists a few feet away could hear him.\n\nTrump's critics suggested he had succumbed to a red mist of anger as he broke a traditional presidential taboo on that level of profanity.\n\nBut body language expert Judi James said it was the opposite. Trump had not 'lost it'. Instead, it was an intentional 'controlled explosion' and a 'presidential mic drop' designed to fully capture the attention of Iran and Israel. \n\n'Straight talking is said to be central to the art of good communication and Trump clearly speaks straight from the hip to the rest of the world here,' she said. 'He ejected the 'f***' word from his mouth like a short-range missile.'\n\nBut the use of the f-word so publicly will have been jarring for many Americans, and it represents a watershed for the state of political discourse.\n\nExperts say the standard of language used by politicians has been deteriorating in recent years.\n\nThat slide into obscenities has been fueled by the increasing polarization of right and left, and the escalating anger of debate on social media.\n\n'We're witnessing a major transition in the history of profanity,' said Grayson Quay, an author and consultant.\n\nMartha Kumar, a presidential scholar who has observed White House communications since December 1975, told the Daily Mail: ' With Trump, we see less of a difference than we do in many presidents, between their public facing and what they are in private.\n\n'And I think that that is a benefit to have that narrow difference between the two, because the public gets to see who the president is.\n\n'With Nixon we didn't know a lot about how he dealt with other people and what his thoughts were. With Trump you know every thought bubble.'\n\nShe added: 'I think it also represents a general coarsening of language.' As lawmakers try to connect with voters through X and other social media their messages have become more profane.\n\nSwear words are no longer just caught on hot mics, but openly and intentionally used.\n\nData produced by Quorum, a public affairs company, found that in 2023 members of Congress used f-bombs on X a total of 205 times, up from none in 2015.\n\nWhile they blame Trump for lowering the tone of political debate it was Democrat lawmakers who used more profanity on X than Republicans - including 161 uses of 's***' in 2023.\n\nRecently, the National Republican Senatorial Committee accused Democrats of being 'obsessed with saying 'f***ing' as the strategy to win back the voters that rejected them in 2024.'\n\nIndeed, in that 2024 campaign it was not Trump, but Vice President Kamala Harris, who dropped an f-bomb on stage.\n\nShe told a group of young voters: 'We have to know that sometimes people will open the door for you and leave it open. Sometimes they won't, and then you need to kick that f***ing door down.'\n\nIt is all a long way from the Watergate era when America were shocked to discover that President Richard Nixon had cursed in private.\n\nTranscripts of his White House tapes revealed many sections marked 'expletive deleted.'\n\nNixon himself would later say: 'People said my language was bad but, Jesus, you should have heard LBJ.'\n\nAnd while President John F. Kennedy was hailed for his soaring oratory, in private he swore like the sailor he had been as a young man.\n\nJFK once told a general on the phone: 'This is obviously a f***-up.'\n\nLater, in 2004, Vice President Dick Cheney caused consternation when, in front of witnesses, he told Senator Patrick Leahy to 'Go f*** yourself' on the Senate floor in a row over the Iraq war.\n\nAt the ceremony to sign Obamacare into law in 2010 Joe Biden was caught turning to Barack Obama and whispering 'This is a big f***ing deal.\n\nHowever, the process of normalizing public presidential profanity really began with Trump.\n\nIn 2016 words like 'hell' and 'damn' and even 's***' were being used at his rallies. \n\nAt a rally in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, Trump silently mouthed the word 'f***' as he said of American companies relocating overseas, 'You can tell them to go f*** themselves.'\n\nThe crowd cheered wildly as he did so.\n\nTwo years later reports emerged he had referred privately to African nations as 's***hole countries.'\n\nAnd by the end of his first term the f-word was being thrown around privately, and in hot mic moments.\n\nIn March 2020, just before giving an Oval Office speech on the looming coronavirus outbreak, Trump was picked up on a hot mic saying, 'Oh f***.'\n\nHe went on 'Uh-oh, I've got a pen mark,' after spotting a stain on his clothing.\n\nSeven months later, as the 2020 election approached, his frustration boiled over during a two-hour 'radio rally' on the late Rush Limbaugh's show. Then too, the subject was Iran.\n\n'If you f*** around with us, if you do something bad to us, we are going to do things to you that have never been done before,' Trump said.\n\nLimbaugh's listeners did not hear the president's profanity as it was edited out, but it was included in the publicly released transcript.\n\nThe show was played on terrestrial radio stations coast to coast, which could have led to a flood of complaints to the Federal Communications Commission had the f-word not been bleeped.\n\nLater, when deciding whether to pardon people convicted of January 6 offences, Trump reportedly told his staff: 'F*** it, release them all.'\n\nRather than condemning Trump for profanity Democrat strategists believe Trump's use of it has helped him with the electorate.\n\nThey are embracing it in an attempt to emulate his success with voters.\n\nAt a rally in Oregon, first-term Democrat congresswoman Maxine Dexter said: 'I don't swear in public very well but we have to f*** Trump.'\n\nAfterwards, she told her local newspaper: 'My only wish, frankly, is that I had said the line with more conviction.'\n\nThere was no such lack of conviction from Trump as he dropped his presidential f-bomb.","summary":"Donald Trump shattered another unwritten presidential rule as he became the first commander-in-chief to deliberately say 'f***' live on TV.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14843005/Trump-swearing-bomb-missile-experts-reveal.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/24/20/99686011-0-image-a-32_1750794177745.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/06/24/8225333784659409511/1024x576_MP4_8225333784659409511.mp4","publish_date":"2025-06-24 22:15:30","author":"Editor,Nick Allen,Nikki Schwab","authors":["Editor","Nick Allen","Nikki Schwab"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.047},{"id":334843060,"title":"Former MSNBC star Joy Reid makes surprising announcement about her political leanings","text":"Former MSNBC host Joy Reid has revealed that she's become disillusioned with the Democratic Party to the point where she's 'barely hanging on'. \n\nThe left-wing commentator said she believes the current Democrat line-up is fueling Donald Trump's agenda by failing to provide effective political opposition. \n\n'I've been a Democrat since I was old enough to vote, but I'm barely hanging on,' Reid told The Breakfast Club podcast on Tuesday. \n\n'At this point, the party is not bigger than the future of my kids.

Fox News Digital reported on Tuesday that the Mountain West Conference hired the firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher (WFG) to investigate allegations against Fleming of conspiring with an opponent to have teammate Brooke Slusser harmed during an Oct. 3 game. The Mountain West hired this firm to handle the investigation in the same month that the same firm represented the conference to protect Fleming's eligibility in a request for preliminary injunction to have the trans athlete disqualified from women's competition. The WFG attorney who led the investigation into allegations against Fleming, Tim Heaphy, later offered the school legal counsel to help it navigate a federal Title IX investigation over the same situation, as seen in public records obtained by Fox News Digital. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM President Donald Trump's administration launched the Title IX investigation into SJSU in February, and he previously referenced the situation during the 2024 volleyball season while campaigning for November's election. Now his White House has weighed in on the recent developments reported by Fox News Digital. \"President Trump is committed to ending the dangerous and unfair participation of men in women’s sports and restoring common sense. President Trump will continue to speak out and take immediate action against schools that are jeopardizing the safety of female athletes,\" White House spokesperson Liz Huston said. Fox News Digital has reached out to San Jose State University and the Mountain West for a response to the White House statement. Heaphy previously served as the chief investigative counsel to the U.S. House of Representatives select committee to investigate the January 6 Capitol protests. WFG is also the law firm that employs Doug Emhoff, the husband of former Vice President Kamala Harris, the 2024 Democratic presidential candidate. Emhoff joined the firm in January, shortly after Trump was sworn into office. WFG struck a deal in April to provide $100 million worth of legal services to the Trump administration, such as supporting veterans and combating antisemitism, per multiple reports. The firm's legal battle to keep the trans athlete in the women's tournament was successful, as federal Judge Kato Crews, appointed by President Joe Biden in January 2024, ruled in favor of Fleming's eligibility on Nov. 25. Two days later, after a failed appeal by the plaintiffs, the firm posted an online press release announcing the legal victory to keep Fleming eligible to play. WHO IS BLAIRE FLEMING?

Fox News Digital asked why the page no longer exists, but Willkie Farr & Gallagher did not respond to the inquiry. Archived data shows the original press release stating, \"Willkie secured a high-profile win for collegiate athletic conference Mountain West Conference in a suit brought by members of San Jose State University’s women’s volleyball team and other Mountain West teams that played against SJSU.\" Fox News Digital has reached out to WFG for further comment. Former University of Kentucky swimmer and OutKick host Riley Gaines, who is engaged in a lawsuit against the NCAA for its previous gender eligibility policies that allowed biological males in women's sports, addressed the developments in an X post on Tuesday. The U.S. Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights is leading the federal Title IX probe into San Jose State's handling of Fleming's situation. University President Cynthia Teniente-Matson previously provided a statement to Fox News Digital saying the university is prepared to cooperate in the investigation. \"San José State University is committed to ensuring that all of our students, including our student-athletes, are treated fairly, free from discrimination, and afforded the rights and protections granted under federal and state law, including privacy rights. \"We follow policies and regulations set forth by the California State University system and applicable law, and we recognize that, at times, these laws and policies may intersect in complex ways.

Our focus remains on our values, including fostering an environment that cultivates compassion, where every student has the opportunity to thrive. We remain steadfast in our role as a place of learning, respect and opportunity for all.\" Heaphy reached out to San Jose State University counsel Dustin May on Feb. 6 after Trump's administration launched the investigation into SJSU over the Fleming situation. \"I saw an ESPN report that the Department of Education has opened an investigation of San Jose State University regarding the participation of a transgender volleyball player. I am familiar with those facts from my work for you and the Mountain West conference last fall,\" Heaphy wrote to May in a Feb. 6 email, as seen in public records obtained by Fox News Digital. \"I also do a lot of work on OCR investigations with the Dept of Ed – including a large resolution of a Title VI matter that I recently resolved with that office for the University of Washington. If you're looking for outside counsel to engage with the Dept on this matter, I'd be glad to help.\" May responded on Feb. 18, declining Heaphy's offer. Heaphy replied the next day, writing, \"Please let me know if we can help in any way on this or other issues.\" Fox News Digital previously reached out to the Mountain West, Willkie Farr & Gallagher, San Jose State University and its head volleyball coach Todd Kress regarding its previous findings. No response has been provided by those parties. May's office initially responded to Fox News Digital's request for comment after providing the public records, requesting a list of questions and background information be provided before speaking. Fox News Digital did not provide the information or list of comments, and requested a virtual or phone interview. May's office then responded with the statement, \"Any speculation that the firm or attorney mentioned in your inquiry represented SJSU or the CSU is unfounded.\" Fox News Digital had not posed that question or any other stipulation, only an interview request, at that point. Fox News Digital later followed up with May's office requesting an interview to address other questions, and fulfilled his office's request to provide background information on what would be discussed. May's office responded saying, \"He will not be available,\" and has not responded to request for further comment.

MTV's influential architect, Van Toffler, is returning to Paramount Global in a multi-year deal to help produce the Video Music Awards, which has long been a signature pop-culture event for the network and music industry. Paramount said Tuesday that it had struck a multi-year arrangement with Toffler, through his Gunpowder & Sky content studio, to \"supercharge\" the VMA's \"into a week-long, multiplatform celebration of music and music videos.\" The show is set for Sept. 7 at the UBS Arena on Long Island in New York. During his 28 years at the company, then known as Viacom, Toffler built MTV into a ratings and youth culture juggernaut, overseeing such touchstones as \"The Osbournes,\" \"Beavis and Butthead,\" \"Jackass,\" \"Unplugged,\" and the VMA's. Toffler exited a decade ago to launch Gunpowder & Sky, which has produced documentaries about Sheryl Crow, Lil Peep and others. It also has experimented with podcasts, digital series and augmented reality. The reunion comes as Paramount struggles to retain the cachet of some of its biggest franchises, including the VMA's, as the cable television landscape shrinks because of the shift to streaming. This year marks the first time the MTV stalwart will be simulcast on Paramount's broadcast network CBS in a bid to expand the audience and give CBS more live programming to help kick off the fall television season. The show also will stream on Paramount+. \"The VMAs have always been where music and spectacle collide, and no one embodies that spirit more than Van Toffler,” Paramount co-CEOs Chris McCarthy and George Cheeks said in a joint statement. “Bringing Van back to the VMAs, along with Gunpowder & Sky, is about reigniting the rebellious soul of the show with a week-long music immersion and delivering global moments that are impossible to ignore.\" MTV plans a week of music videos to try to resurrect the magic of the era when 20-somethings turned to MTV for music and entertainment. The approach will be tailored for today's audiences with current videos. Past VMA winners and former MTV personalities will return to curate their favorite videos. \"We’re launching a celebration of music that spans one week, every screen and every generation,\" Toffler said. He will produce the show in conjunction with the firm, Den of Thieves. This year's show comes as Paramount is in the process of being sold to David Ellison's Skydance Media. For that $8 billion deal, approved last July, to move forward, Paramount needs approval from the Federal Communications Commission.

But the deal hit a snag over amid negotiations to settle President Trump's $20-billion lawsuit over \"60 Minutes\" edits to a Kamala Harris interview last fall.

This month, GM announced that it is investing $4 billion in its U.S. plants over the next two years to boost the manufacturing of gas and electric vehicles in a move that was hailed by many on social media. The announcement comes two years after GM had pledged $13 billion to U.S. plants over the next five years as part of a settlement to end a UAW strike. Two of the sites mentioned in 2023, the Orion Assembly plant and Spring Hill Manufacturing plant, are mentioned in the 2025 announcement. AUTO PRICE INCREASES: IT&apos;S MORE COMPLICATED THAN HIGHER TARIFFS A GM spokesperson told Fox Business that the 2025 investment is a new investment. Despite the investment and Barra’s recent willingness to work with the Trump administration, a Fox News Digital review found several examples of GM closing U.S. plants and becoming a fixture producing overseas. GM has closed three U.S. plants since 2018, in Michigan, Ohio, and Baltimore, and converted a fourth to electric vehicles, Detroit News reported. \"Very disappointed with General Motors and their CEO, Mary Barra, for closing plants in Ohio, Michigan and Maryland,\" Trump posted on social media at the time. \"Nothing being closed in Mexico & China. The U.S. saved General Motors, and this is the THANKS we get!\" In 2024, GM was described in a Mexico Business News report as the largest vehicle manufacturer in Mexico. Additionally, in 2024, Bloomberg reported that GM imported more automobiles into the United States than any other car company, exceeding Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp. The report said that nearly half of all the vehicles GM sold in the United States last year were made overseas. SECRET SERVICE RECEIVES 10 VEHICLES FOR AGENT TRAINING FROM GENERAL MOTORS Since 2015, the year after Barra took over, GM has dropped 12 points in the Kogod Auto Index, an American University tracker that ranks car manufacturers on how American their cars are. \"GM is just the latest of companies to play the America First card, while shipping jobs and production overseas,\" a senior GOP operative told FOX Business. \"President Trump has been the single greatest job creator this country has ever seen.\" Barra has publicly supported President Trump’s tariff agenda despite the company saying it would financially hurt them, which the Wall Street Journal said in an op-ed was a decision made in \"hopes of preserving some influence with the White House and warding off worse policy harm.\" \"This is a classic example of a big corporation cozying up to a political office holder to garner influence,\" Heritage Foundation Chief Economist EJ Antoni told FOX Business. \"Instead of making vehicles people actually want, for a price they can afford, with American labor and American materials, GM has failed on all four counts, all because it was banking on Democrats forcing consumers into EVs.\" Bloomberg reported earlier this year that Barra has \"staked her legacy on EVs\" and has chosen to \"stay the course\" on EV production rather than follow other carmakers who have shifted more production back to gas and hybrid. In a letter to shareholders last month, Barra made a point of saying she is \"grateful to President Trump  for his  support of the U.S. automotive industry.\" Antoni told FOX Business that GM will \"need to do more than pay lip service to President Trump’s agenda if it wants to turn the corner from this misguided bet on EVs.\" \"GM foolishly went all-in on the transition to electric vehicles, and that bet hasn’t paid out. When you look at political donations, GM and its affiliates have been giving much more money to Democrats, including Kamala Harris, than Republicans—another bet that hasn’t paid out,\" Antoni continued. \"Not only was GM on the wrong side of politics, but on the wrong side of consumer preferences. Put simply, people don’t want the electric vehicles GM makes, at least not in the numbers they’ve been produced. The only way GM would’ve been able to push such cars on consumers would be if the government forced it. Without the strongarm of the state, however, GM stands to lose big time out on its wrongheaded bet that Democrats would shove the green new scam down everyone’s throats.\" The amount of GM&apos;s UAW workers also appears to have shrunk since Barra took the helm from 73,000 employees in 2007 to just 45,000 in 2024. GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE In a CNBC interview earlier this year, Barra responded to the allegation that she was \"dancing around the question\" of bringing more jobs into the United States. \"Are you going to bring plants back to the United States?\" Barra was asked on CNBC&apos;s \"Squawk Box.\" \"So we have a lot of plants,\" Barra said. \"We have more assembly plants in this country already. We have over 50 plants that are not only final assembly, but component plants and part distribution centers.\" \"We&apos;re going to leverage that footprint that we have because we have the ability to add capacity to many of those plants.

Those talks are also going on back channel in Cairo; there’s a Hamas delegation there. Try to get that ceasefire in place.

He previously served on former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama’s National Security Councils. He also served as the special presidential envoy for the Global Coalition to Counter the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) during both the Obama administration and President Donald Trump’s first term. However, he resigned from that post in 2018 following Trump’s decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, along with then-Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis for the same reason. EX-CLINTON OFFICIAL APPLAUDS TRUMP’S 'COURAGEOUS' IRAN CALL, DOUBTS HARRIS WOULD'VE HAD THE NERVE In addition to McGurk, other officials who served in Democratic administrations also weighed in to support Trump’s handling of the Iran conflict, including Jamie Metzl, who previously served as former President Bill Clinton’s director for multilateral affairs on the National Security Council. Metzl said that while he’s been critical of Trump and voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election, he doesn’t believe Harris could have pulled off the strikes against Iranian targets like Trump did. \"Iran has been at war with the United States for 46 years,\" Metzl said in a post on X Sunday. \"Its regime has murdered thousands of American citizens. Its slogan ‘death to America’ was not window dressing but core ideology. It was racing toward a nuclear weapon with every intention of using it to threaten America, our allies, and the Middle East region as a whole.\" RUSSIAN LEADER CLAIMS MULTIPLE COUNTRIES PREPPED TO PROVIDE IRAN NUCLEAR WEAPONS FOLLOWING US STRIKES \"Although I believe electing Kamala Harris would have been better for our democracy, society, and economy, as well as for helping the most vulnerable people in the United States and around the world, I also believe VP Harris would not have had the courage or fortitude to take such an essential step as the president took last night,\" Metzl said. The U.S. launched strikes late Saturday targeting key Iranian nuclear facilities: Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan. The mission involved more than 125 U.S. aircraft, including B-2 stealth bombers, according to Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine. While Trump said early Tuesday that a ceasefire had gone into effect between Israel and Iran, Trump issued tough words for both countries later Tuesday morning amid accusations from both sides that the other had violated the agreement. ISRAEL-IRAN CONFLICT: LIVE UPDATES Trump told reporters both Israel and Iran failed to follow the terms of the agreement, which he said is still in effect. \"I’m not happy with them,\" Trump said at the White House Tuesday morning. 'I’m not happy with Iran either, but I’m really unhappy with Israel going out this morning.\" \"We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don’t know what the f--- they’re doing,\" he said.","summary":"Former President Joe Biden’s National Security Council coordinator for the Middle East and North Africa lauded the Trump administration&apos;s efforts handling the conflict between Iran and Israel.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bidens-middle-east-coordinator-praises-trump-team-handling-iranian-conflict","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/06/931/523/trump-iran-missile.png?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-24 20:11:57","author":"Diana Stancy","authors":["Diana Stancy"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.105},{"id":334829774,"title":"July Fourth celebrations are fizzling thanks to Trump's economy","text":"Fourth of July celebrations will likely be more expensive this year under President Donald Trump’s economy, thanks to near-record-high beef prices and higher gas prices.\n\nAccording to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, consumers can expect that ground beef, steak, and round roast will cost between 57 to 75 cents more than a year ago, when former President Joe Biden was in office.

More than any candidate, he sensed the war-weariness of Americans after the fiascos in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya, and especially the dismay of military veterans, 60% of whom voted for him over Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Trump’s maverick, anti-interventionist “America First” narrative also resonated strongly with those in the Maga movement who have never served in the military, particularly blue-collar workers.\n\nNow, Trump, once an unsparing critic of military misadventures, has bombed the nuclear enrichment installations of Iran, a country that hadn’t attacked the US, wasn’t preparing to and didn’t even threaten war. Since the bombing, Trump has gone further: he has ruminated about regime change in Iran. His transformation has startled many of his Maga acolytes who share Tucker Carlson’s view that Trump risks being dragged into Israel’s fight with Iran and becoming embroiled in his own forever war. The fragile truce agreed to by Iran and Israel may ease their worries if it holds, but Trump might be drawn to regime change again if fighting resumes.\n\nPerhaps Trump floated regime change to scare Iran’s leaders into dismantling their entire enrichment operation, something Tehran rejected from the outset of the negotiations with Washington. The president may believe that the risk of losing power will force Iran’s leadership, which is already under military pressure from Israel, to relent.\n\nBut Trump doesn’t need to go down this path. Having hit Iran’s enrichment installations – though it is now evident that they weren’t obliterated, contrary to his boast immediately after the strike – the president could declare victory. He could tell Israel’s strongest American supporters that he delivered on his pledge to protect it and then turn to reassuring Maga’s stars, such as Tucker Carlson and Steve Bannon, that he remains a foe of forever wars. He won’t get Iran to sign a no-enrichment deal, but so what? He could claim that, contrary to the malicious mainstream media’s claims, he did in fact demolish Iran’s enrichment capabilities.\n\nTaking this path would make sense. Despite his tough-guy persona, Trump has an instinctive aversion to needless wars that could turn into quagmires. The recent strike on Iran was risk-free: Iran lacked the air defenses needed to down the B-2 stealth bombers, so there was no chance of American pilots being killed or captured. And Tehran does not have the means to strike the American homeland in return. Even its ineffectual, face-saving missile salvoes against the US military base in Qatar were preceded by a warning – proof that Iran doesn’t want to do anything that might push Trump to join Israel’s war.\n\nIran has, in effect, provided Trump an opportunity to forget about regime change. He’d be foolish not to take it. Moving forward with the idea will create problems – politically at home, militarily in Iran.\n\nOn the domestic political front, the Carlson-Bannon wing of Maga will soon look past Trump’s attack on Iran, which JD Vance and the US defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, have already said doesn’t presage something bigger. But a war of regime change will be the equivalent of a bombshell. It will create a canyon-sized rift in Trump’s base between the unconditional supporters of Israel and those who think that the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, seeks to drag the US into his war because he believes that the destruction of the Iranian political system can prevent a nuclear-armed Iran. Trump has nothing to gain from such an outcome.\n\nThe military and strategic hazards of a regime change war are even worse, and one of them stems from the sheer size of Iran. It has nearly 92 million people and a land area of 636,371 sq miles (1,648,193 sq km). By contrast, Iraq’s population is less than half as large, and its territory is less than a third the size. Moreover, the Iranian army and ancillary forces, more than half a million active-duty soldiers, won’t go quietly into the night. They will have the advantage of fighting an invader on home ground and on many fronts across a vast area. Though many Iranians dislike the existing political order, it is hardly certain that they will welcome an invader rather than rallying as nationalists to defend their homeland.\n\nMoreover, a military intervention in a multi-ethnic country like Iran could precipitate prolonged disorder and bloodletting. Persians comprise only 60% of the country’s population. Azerbaijanis account for 16%, Kurds for another 10%, and there are numerous smaller nationalities. The relationship between the Iranian state and minority ethnic groups, especially the Kurds, has featured periods of tension, even violence. The expectation of a regime collapse could trigger rebellions and, in response, repression by the state.\n\nAn optimist could counter that regime change need not require an occupation force tasked with creating stability. But the idea that a country’s political order can be revamped through airpower alone is an illusion. Regime change zealots could say, bombs away, stability be damned, upheaval will achieve the goal. The problem, however, is that the US can’t insulate itself from the resulting shock waves.\n\nIran exports 1.3 million-plus barrels of oil a day and overlooks the strait of Hormuz, the conduit for 20% of global oil exports. Iran also adjoins seven countries and shares maritime borders with six others. The latter are all closely aligned with the US, which has bases or a military presence on their territories. Shia Muslims, who make up 90% of Iran’s population, comprise between 55% and 70% of Bahrain’s population. Shia Muslims constitute only 10-12% of Saudi Arabia’s population but are concentrated in its oil-rich eastern province, where they account for 25-30% of its denizens. An American intervention in Iran won’t necessarily produce solidarity protests in these underdog Shia communities, but they could, and the Gulf monarchies may struggle to contain the consequences.\n\nGiven these sobering realities, it would be naive to believe that the US could take a wrecking ball to the Iranian state and walk away unaffected. Here’s hoping that Trump comes to understand this and won’t revert to dreams of regime change if the truce collapses. For now at least, Trump’s recent disavowal of regime change on the ground that it would produce chaos is welcome news. We must hope that the mercurial president doesn’t change his mind, as he does so often.\n\n Rajan Menon is a professor emeritus of international relations at the City College of New York and a senior research scholar at Columbia University’s Saltzman Institute of War and Peace Studies","summary":"It would be naive to believe that the US could take a wrecking ball to the Iranian state and walk away unaffected\n\nDuring his three presidential campaigns, Donald Trump lambasted “forever wars” and “regime change” interventions.

The sentence above has been tried and tested, becoming the reason for several dozen viral posts. Zohran Mamdani, one of New York City's Democratic mayoral candidates, has been at the center of internet fervor for months leading up to the Democratic primary election taking place Tuesday, June 24. From influencer endorsements to \"extremely wearable\" merch, Mamdani has led a digital campaign that caught eyes and mobilized voters.Mamdani, a 33-year-old democratic socialist, is the leading favorite in a race against Andrew Cuomo, the former New York governor who resigned in disgrace back in 2021 following allegations of sexual harassment. A poll released on Monday shows Mamdani passing Cuomo in a ranked-choice voting simulation, with Mamdani winning an estimated 52 percent against Cuomo's 48 percent. The survey, conducted by Emerson College Polling, PIX11, and The Hill, found that support for Mamdani surged over the last five months, from 1 percent to 32 percent. And it was over these last five months that millions of social media feeds were flooded by Mamdani's presence. People in New York City will recognize the facets of his campaign immediately: Mamdani's name written in blue-and-orange tone bubble letters; grainy, aesthetic video footage of the candidate walking the length of Manhattan on a warm Friday evening; interviews as he rides the subway; and TikTok speeches delivered in Bengali, Hindi, Spanish, each garnering thousands of likes. \n\nIn these posts across the internet, Mamdani highlights what he hopes to deliver to New Yorkers: rent freezes, city-subsidized grocery stores, fare-free buses, and universal childcare. The candidate has spoken out for trans youth and mental health, protested against the war in the Middle East, condemned ICE snatching New Yorkers off the streets, and suggested wealthy New York corporations could be taxed at higher rates. And somehow, all of this has come packaged with charisma, humor, and a striking sense of sincerity. He speaks about his policies and ideas while carrying heart-shaped balloons through the city, interviewing voters outside Madison Square Garden, eating a burrito on the subway, and plunging into the water at Coney Island. Is this how Mamdani won over young, online voters? Dr. Jess Rauchberg, a social media expert and an assistant professor of communication technologies at Seton Hall University, thinks so. \"Zohran’s campaign feels fresh and personal,\" says Dr. Rauchberg. \"When the videos come up in a user’s FYP, it feels personal and intimate, like a friend talking to you. He’s not just feeding voters sound bites, he’s giving us concrete ideas on his policies and ways to get involved.\" \n\nMedia outlets have pointed out his social media use for months, with many focusing on the quality of production and his wide reach. \"You couldn’t get on social media without seeing one of his well-produced videos pitching his vision,\" writes the AP. The City touts Mamdani as a \"digital native\", drawing in New Yorkers by \"mixing big policy proposals with a little silliness.\" The New York Times described Mamdani as a \"magnet for attention\", managing to rise in polls \"through a mix of social media savvy and a plain-spoken, everyman approach.\"Supporters of Mamdani back both the message and the method. Online, Gen-Z and millennial voters, in particular, have voiced their support for his digital prowess and how effectively Mamdani has relayed his vision. \"It's one of the most genius campaigns I've ever seen,\" said TikTok creator @chummertok in a video. \"Not only is he making relatable content, it's objectively entertaining to watch.\" \n\nHis campaign has lent itself to TikTokkers churning out their own Mamdani-centric content. For instance, over 200 creators have made videos with an audio clip of Mamdani taking down Cuomo in a primary debate. Mamdani's words are heard over cheers: \"I have never had to resign in disgrace. I have never cut Medicaid, I have never stolen hundreds of millions of dollars from the MTA, I have never hounded the 13 women who credibly accused me of sexual harassment, I have never sued for their gynecological records, and I have never done those things because I am not you, Mr. Cuomo.\"\n\n This Tweet is currently unavailable.

Among college graduates aged 18-34, 67 percent ranked Mamdani first, compared to Cuomo's 6 percent, according to a poll by the Manhattan Institute. However, the institute's poll still shows Cuomo will beat out Mamdani in both the primary and the general election in November. Whether that holds true — or whether Mamdani’s online strategy flips the script — remains to be seen.\n\n Swifties for Kamala: How Taylor Swift fans are creating a new blueprint for political organizing\n\nThe role of social media in elections over the last decade cannot be understated. But just as social media has won over voters and brought candidates to the finish line, it has also failed to bring tangible momentum to certain campaigns.\n\n This Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed.\n\nTake America's 2024 presidential election. Mashable's Tim Marcin wrote of the 2024 election, \"Today's presidential campaigns are Too Online, and it's to the point where real-life issues might get lost in the noise of memes and digital posturing.\" Democratic candidate Kamala Harris ran a noticeable social media campaign, one filled with memes and aligned with online trends. And while she gained traction amongst voters, there is a real risk that online engagement doesn't translate to meaningful action. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump used platforms like his very own Truth Social to push out misinformation and ultimately win over the disillusioned. Within the right-wing echo chamber online, Trump and his administration pulled favor with such posts.\n\n This Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed.\n\nMamdani's campaign falls in the realm of Extremely Online, but it's already surpassed the mistakes of political campaigns in the past. He has accomplished what Harris and other politicians, especially Democrats, have failed, by delivering both cohesiveness and authenticity. Politico suggests that Mamdani is achieving what politicians on the right have done in recent elections: winning over young people by creating connections online, in a way that Democrats have been \"flailing\" to achieve. Mamdani's messaging is clear, and his content is personable, likely creating a blueprint for future politicians in their online pursuits. \"We’re in an increasingly conservative media environment,\" says Dr. Rauchberg. \"I’ve said before that politicians need to play the campaign game like influencers, and that’s something Zohran has done exceptionally well. Regardless of the outcome, he’s spread himself across platforms and balanced in-person and media appearances.\" \"I think there’s a lot politicians can learn from Zohran, especially for Dems,\" she says.Crucially, the action of his campaign hasn't just taken place behind a screen.

He repeatedly expressed intentions to “kill her” through his social media activities.\n\nSteven Alexander Hartford faced an indictment from a federal grand jury last week, charged with two offenses of threatening a significant presidential contender, as highlighted in court records. As per a press statement by the Department of Justice, Hartford utilized and managed the TikTok username “thealex13one13”, through which he issued threats against the ex-California attorney general, starting in the summer of 2024.\n\nThe first threat was allegedly issued on July 21, 2024, in response to a 17-second video posted by the Daily Mail that was captioned, “Will Kamala Harris be the next Democratic nominee?” At about 7:32 p.m. that evening, Hartford allegedly commented, “I will assassinate her if she runs for pres.,” a copy of the indictment states.\n\nLater that same day, the Daily Mail posted a 12-second video to TikTok that showed Harris and was captioned, “Could [Kamala Harris] replace Joe Biden?”\n\nAt about 7:56 p.m. that evening, Hartford responded to the video by commenting, “I will assassinate her.”\n\nLove true crime? Sign up for our newsletter, The Law&Crime Docket, to get the latest real-life crime stories delivered right to your inbox.\n\nThe following day, authorities say that Hartford made several other threats directed at Harris under the username “thealex13one13,” including: “22 250 coming her way,” “5.56 for her,” and “5.56 waiting for her.”\n\nIt appears likely that “22 250” is a reference to a high-velocity 22-caliber rifle cartridge while “5.56” is likely a reference to another rifle cartridge typically used in assault rifles.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney”s Office noted that the case stems from “Operation Take Back America,” which it describes as a “nationwide initiative that marshals the full resources of the Department of Justice to repel the invasion of illegal immigration, achieve the total elimination of cartels and transnational criminal organizations (TCOs), and protect our communities from the perpetrators of violent crime.”\n\nThe operation attempts to streamline efforts and resources from the DOJ’s Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces and Project Safe Neighborhood.\n\nIf convicted, Hartford faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in federal prison for each charge as well as fines, supervised release, and “the imposition of a special assessment.”\n\nHartford on Monday pleaded not guilty to both charges during his first appearance in court.\n\nU.S. Magistrate Judge Susan E. Schwab ordered Hartford released from detention provided surrender his passport, restrict his travel to the Middle District of Pennsylvania, not possess a firearm, and participate in a substance abuse program, per court documents.\n\nHartford is currently scheduled to go to trial before U.S. District Judge Julia K. Munley, a Joe Biden appointee, on Aug. 25, 2025.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nFILE – Vice President Kamala Harris boards Air Force Two as she&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Man Threatens to Kill Harris If She Runs for President: Federal Authorities Report first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/crime/man-threatens-to-kill-harris-if-she-runs-for-president-federal-authorities-report/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Man-stunned-by-arrest-for-Kamala-Harris-threats-Complaint.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-24 18:03:51","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.31},{"id":334874786,"title":"Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner Are Investing $1.4 Billion To Turn Abandoned Soviet Weapons Base in Albania Into Luxury Island Resort","text":"Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, are set to invest a staggering $1.4 billion into turning an abandoned Soviet weapons base into a luxury island resort—as the former first daughter prepares to follow in her father’s footsteps as a real estate developer.\n\nIvanka, 43, and Kushner, 44, who recently finished work on their family mansion in Miami, have spent the past year working on plans to transform the Albanian island of Sazan—one of the last undeveloped islands in the Mediterranean—into a must-visit destination for the wealthy and privileged.\n\nThe couple, who both served as senior advisors in President Donald Trump‘s first administration but opted not to rejoin his cabinet after his 2024 election win, took a massive step toward their dream of creating the “extraordinary” retreat in January, when their plans received preliminary approval from the Albanian government, according to the New York Times.\n\nThat approval came just two months after Ivanka’s father claimed victory over Democratic candidate Kamala Harris, and days before he was inaugurated for the second time, with the outlet noting that the project is “one of several” involving members of the president’s family and foreign government entities that Trump will be actively working with in the White House.\n\nBoth Kushner and a spokesperson for the Albanian government had previously shut down any suggestion that the project’s evaluation process would be in any way influenced by its direct connection to Trump—however, that hasn’t stopped questions from being raised over the approval.\n\n“The fact that such a renowned American entrepreneur shows his interest on investing in Albania makes us very proud and happy,” a representative of Albanian President Edi Rama told the Times in 2024.\n\nEven before the couple had received approval for their plans, locals were abuzz with speculation about the project, with many now referring to the island as “Ishulli i Trumpëve,” which translates to “Trump Island.”\n\nBoth Ivanka and Kushner have close ties to the real estate industry via their respective families. Before President Trump launched himself into politics, he was best known for his career as a developer, while Kushner’s family owns a vast portfolio of commercial, residential, and retail properties in and around New York.\n\nHowever, this project marks the first time that the couple will venture into the heady world of luxury hotels—with multiple reports noting that they face a steep uphill battle before their resort will be ready for visitors.\n\nHaving conquered the first hurdle—receiving approval from the government to forge ahead with their plans—the duo will now have to tackle the remnants of the island’s somewhat dark past as a Soviet-era storage facility for chemical weapons.\n\nAccording to Italian journalist Marzio Mian, who visited the island in July 2024, shortly after Ivanka and Kushner’s plans for the 1,400-acre land were revealed, it is littered with “signs depicting skull and crossbones, warning of landmines,” with visitors to the area warned not to venture too far off specific paths out of fears that they could stumble across an unexploded ordnance.\n\nPlans to remove the remaining weapons and ammunition on the island are well underway, however, with the Albanian government announcing in July 2020 that members of the country’s armed forces had been despatched to Sazan in order to begin clearing it of any dangerous ordnance.\n\nAfter Ivanka and Kushner’s plans for their resort received preliminary approval, the Albanian government confirmed that it would work with them in order to continue clearing their development site of all unexploded and buried weapons.\n\nAs for the crumbling military buildings and 3,600 derelict bunkers that were abandoned on the island, the couple is reportedly planning to incorporate at least a few of them into their hotel plans—with Ivanka revealing in a 2024 podcast interview that they were working with the “best architects and the best brands” to make the resort into an “extraordinary” property.\n\nDespite the remnants of the island’s dark past as a Communist military base, tourists began flocking to its dazzling beaches as early as 2017, when it was reopened to the public after being closed for years.\n\nAccording to Lonely Planet, the island is easily accessible by regular ferries from Vlore, one of Albania’s most popular—and luxurious—tourist destinations, a reputation that Ivanka and Kushner will undoubtedly be keen to transfer to their own high-end hotel.\n\n“Once used as a submarine and chemical-weapons base by the Soviet Union during the Cold War, it’s now home to an Albanian-Italian military base used to combat narcotics smuggling,” Lonely Planet states.\n\n“In the summer of 2017, a small area of the island opened to visitors, making parts of its pristine coastline and historic relics accessible for the first time.”\n\nPresident Rama made no secret of his excitement about the Trump-Kushner development, telling The Guardian that he believes Albania “can’t afford not to exploit a gift like Sazan” and adding: “We need luxury tourism like a desert needs water.”\n\nTo that end, the government is even in the process of building an airport near Vlore to ferry wealthy tourists directly to the country’s most affluent and desirable area—an airport that would also serve as an easy access point for Ivanka and Kushner’s hotel.\n\nHowever, not everyone is thrilled about the project, with some critics accusing the Albanian government of a lack of transparency about the deal with the couple, according to the Times.\n\nOne, Agron Shehaj, who is a member of the opposition party in the Albanian government, told the outlet: “Of course for Albania, which is a poor country, it is important to develop tourism. But there has been a lack of transparency here, and it makes it look like this is a private deal that is in the political interest of the prime minister of Albania.”\n\nOthers raised concerns about the impact that the development will have on the island’s thriving wildlife, including freelance tour guide Arben Kola, who told The Independent: “The way tourism works for Sazan at the moment is it helps to preserve nature, not damage it. We shouldn’t change that.”\n\nThough Kushner has not commented on the recent reports about his proposed tourism mecca, he told The Guardian in 2024 that their plans would carefully consider Sazan’s natural environment—stating: “When people announce a development, everyone gets scared.\n\n“Everybody assumes the worst. But once they see the plans we have, the way we’re designing it, the way we’re being faithful and considerate of the environment around us, I think that people will be very, very pleased. And again, with developments, you never make everyone happy.”\n\nAs yet, it is unclear when work on the resort will begin—with documents pertaining to the preliminary government approval noting that officials had the right to revoke the decision pending further negotiations.\n\nRelated Articles","url":"https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/ivanka-trump-jared-kushner-investing-164900790.html","image":"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/W.TBV.GHYE1ZgdXmsUg5sg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/realtor_com_468/0a5cde807d42c34ac983758cc140e14a","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-24 16:49:00","author":"Charlie Lankston","authors":["Charlie Lankston"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.023},{"id":334780634,"title":"CBS blasts Trump’s lawsuit as ‘meritless’ despite recent $15 million settlement offer","text":"CBS attorneys blasted President Donald Trump’s lawsuit as \"meritless\" on Monday despite recently offering $15 million to make it go away. Trump is seeking $20 billion from CBS News and its parent company, Paramount Global, for what he alleged was election interference with how the network edited its interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris before the presidential election. \"CBS is up against the wall and is in the desperation zone. The last thing they want is for this case to go to trial,\" a source close to Trump told Fox News Digital. TRUMP REJECTS PARAMOUNT'S $15 MILLION OFFER TO SETTLE CBS NEWS LAWSUIT, DEMANDS APOLOGY While the two sides have been in mediation in hopes of reaching a settlement, CBS lawyers have continued to simultaneously claim the lawsuit is bogus. \"This is a meritless lawsuit,\" attorneys for CBS and parent company Paramount Global wrote Monday in a reply to Trump’s motion to deny CBS’ request to dismiss the lawsuit. CBS suggested the plaintiff’s opposition indicated it was targeting a news organization for \"editorial decisions Plaintiffs dislike,\" and asked the court to dismiss Trump’s amended complaint. \"The chilling effect of Plaintiffs’ meritless assault on the First Amendment compels dismissal now,\" CBS attorneys argued. Fox News Digital confirmed last month that Trump rejected a $15 million offer to settle. He is seeking a larger payout and an apology from CBS News. \"President Trump is committed to holding those who traffic in fake news, hoaxes, and lies to account. CBS and Paramount targeted the President in an attempt to harm his reputation while committing the worst kind of election interference and fraud in the closing days of the most important presidential election in history. President Trump will pursue this vital matter to its just and rightful conclusion,\" Trump attorney Ed Paltzik told Fox News Digital. CBS NEWS STAFFERS RATTLED BY CEO'S ABRUPT EXIT AS TRUMP LAWSUIT LOOMS OVER NETWORK The months-long legal saga stems from an exchange Harris had in October with \"60 Minutes\" correspondent Bill Whitaker, who asked her why Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wasn't \"listening\" to the Biden administration. Harris was widely mocked for the \"word salad\" answer that aired in a preview clip of the interview on \"Face the Nation.\" However, when Whitaker asked the same question during the primetime special, Harris had a different, more concise response. Critics at the time accused CBS News of editing Harris' \"word salad\" answer to shield the then-vice president from further backlash leading up to Election Day. Earlier this year, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chair Brendan Carr ordered CBS News to hand over the unedited transcript of the interview as part of its investigation into whether the network violated the FCC's \"news distortion\" policy after a complaint was filed. CBS had refused to release the unedited transcript when the controversy first began. '60 MINUTES' KAMALA HARRIS INTERVIEW AT THE CENTER OF TRUMP'S CBS LAWSUIT RECEIVES EMMY NOMINATION The released raw transcript and footage showed that both sets of Harris' comments came from the same response, but CBS News had aired only the first half of her response in the \"Face the Nation\" preview clip and aired the second half during the primetime special. In the months since, CBS News has faced ongoing turmoil. Shari Redstone, Paramount’s controlling shareholder who is battling thyroid cancer, is in favor of settling the lawsuit with the president, but recused herself from settlement discussions. Media observers believe a settlement would pave the way for Paramount's planned merger with Skydance Media in hopes of preventing potential retribution by Trump's FCC, which has the authority to halt the multibillion-dollar transaction.

Emhoff will join the faculty of his alma mater beginning in July, the university announced Monday. “In this difficult moment for the legal community, I believe it is more important than ever to instill in the next generation of lawyers the same principles that drove me to the legal profession: the imperative of speaking out on behalf of the vulnerable, standing up for the rule of law, defending every citizen’s fundamental rights, and always fighting for justice, without fear or favor,” Emhoff said in a statement.

And frankly, the networks aren’t much better. It’s all fake news!”\n\nYet another one of the president’s anti-media tirades came as he was visibly angry that the “complete and total” ceasefire he announced just the night before between Iran and Israel had already been broken, prompting him to profanely blast the two countries for violating the truce.\n\n“Iran violated it, but Israel violated it too,” he groused. “Israel, as soon as we made the deal, they came out and they dropped a load of bombs the likes of which I’ve never seen before. The biggest load that we’ve seen.”\n\nAdding that he was “really unhappy with Israel” and “not happy with Iran either,” the president wrapped up his rant by raging at both warring nations. “You know what? We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don’t know what the f*** they’re doing, do you understand that?!” Trump grumbled before stomping off to his helicopter.\n\nTrump was departing the White House on Tuesday to head to the Netherlands, where he will participate in a NATO summit at The Hague, where the conflict between Iran and Israel – and America’s direct involvement in it – will undoubtedly be a significant topic of discussion.\n\nMeanwhile, before tossing his international f-bombs, Trump devoted much of his energy on Tuesday morning to raging about cable news’ coverage of the American airstrikes on three underground nuclear facilities, which the president had described as a “spectacular military success” that “completely and totally obliterated” the nation’s nuclear program.\n\nDespite the president’s boasts, experts have said that the attack – which featured several B-2 bombers dropping over a dozen bunker-busting bombs – did not destroy Iran’s stockpile of enriched uranium and may have actually emboldened the country to build a bomb. \n\nCNN reported that even if the Fordow underground site was destroyed, which analysts say would be a “tall order,” most of Iran’s already-enriched uranium was stored in Ishafan – a facility that was not hit by the B-2 bombers but instead targeted by Tomahawk missiles. “This is an incomplete strike. If this is all there is, here’s what left: the entire stockpile of 60% uranium, which was stored at Isfahan in tunnels that are untouched,” one weapons expert told CNN.\n\nWith CNN and other networks expressing skepticism over the president’s claims about the effectiveness of “Operation Midnight Hammer,” Trump lashed out when asked on the White House lawn how confident he was that Iran’s nuclear program had been devastated.\n\n“I think it‘s been completely demolished. I think the reason we‘re here is because those pilots, those B-2 pilots, did an unbelievable job,” he responded. “And, you know, the fake news – like CNN in particular – they‘re trying to say, ‘Well, I agree that it was destroyed, but maybe not that destroyed.’ You know what they‘re doing. They’re really hurting great pilots that put their lives on the line.”\n\nAfter calling CNN and MSNBC “scum,” the president then accused the networks of descerating the honor of both him and the military personnel who took part in the weekend bombing raid.\n\n“Those pilots hit their targets,” Trump complained. “Those targets were obliterated, and the pilots should be given credit. They‘re not after the pilots; they're after me. They want to try and demean me.”\n\nInsisting that Iran “will never rebuild its nuclear from there,” referring to the Fordow facility, the president continued to praise the B-2 pilots before grumbling some more about the “fake news” and its coverage of the crisis.\n\n“I think CNN ought to apologize to the pilots of the B-2s. I think that MSDNC ought to apologize. I think these guys, really these networks and these cable networks, are real losers. You really are. You‘re real losers!” Trump exclaimed. \n\n“You‘re gutless losers. I say that to CNN because I watch it. I have no choice. I got to watch that garbage. It‘s all garbage. It‘s all fake news,” he added. “But I think CNN is a gutless group of people. And the people that run it, nobody even knows. It‘s been sold so many times. But the people that run it, ought to be ashamed.”\n\nTrump’s ragefest about cable news being nasty to him and his administration comes after he took to his social media platform to make similar complaints about the coverage the airstrikes had received from the mainstream press, which featured him name-checking several anchors and network executives.\n\n“The sites that we hit in Iran were totally destroyed, and everyone knows it,” Trump posted on Truth Social earlier this week. “Only the Fake News would say anything different in order to try and demean, as much as possible — And even they say they were ‘pretty well destroyed!’”\n\n“Working especially hard on this falsehood is Allison Cooper of Fake News CNN,” he added, taking a homophobic swipe at CNN anchor Anderson Cooper. “Dumb Brian L. Roberts, Chairman of ‘Con’cast, Jonny Karl of ABC Fake News, and always, the Losers of, again, Concast’s NBC Fake News. It never ends with the sleazebags in the Media, and that’s why their Ratings are at an ALL TIME LOW — ZERO CREDIBILITY!”\n\nThe president, of course, has made attacks on the mainstream media a feature of his presidency. While he’s currently suing CBS News over a Kamala Harris interview and threatening legal action against other news organizations, which has seen his handpicked FCC chairman launch several investigations, Trump has also regularly lashed out at CNN and MSNBC.\n\nLast month, for instance, the president raged at “highly neurotic” MSNBC anchor Stephanie Ruhle for saying the president was looking to back away from his “Liberation Day” tariffs because of a potential recession. The president claimed that MSNBC had committed a “Major Campaign Violation” and was “nothing less than an arm of the Democrat National Committee","summary":"‘I think CNN ought to apologize to the pilots of the B-2s.

He later posted on Truth Social that “the ceasefire is now in effect. Please do not violate it!” Former PGA Tour star Kim seemed more than happy with the US President’s involvement in the matter. Interestingly, the 40-year-old typed out the tweet mimicking words of kids.He said he ‘knows the ceasefire is good’ and claimed being happy that the US President isn’t ‘listening to nonsense’ and ‘standing on business.’ However, he misspelt almost all words intentionally to give a sense of the writer being a young child. The reason behind this is unclear.Posting a picture of him with Donald Trump from the final round of LIV Golf Miami in April, 2024, Anthony Kim wrote on X:“Me no smart but me no ceasefire is good. Me happy 4. Also me happy OUR president @realDonaldTrump no listening 2 noncents & as young kids say STAND on BIDNESS me honored 2 stand w &#127482;&#127480; president.”Kim interacted with fans in the comments section under the post and confirmed being sober while posting the tweet. He also got trolled by a few for the child-like sentence construction.When Anthony Kim endorsed Donald Trump for electionFor the unversed, Anthony Kim was among the popular golfers, including Bryson DeChambeau, who openly endorsed Donald Trump during the United States Presidential Election. The former PGA Tour star had made a series of social media posts ahead of the elections backing the Republican leader in his face off against Kamala Harris.Notably, Kim also stirred a controversy when he made a lengthy Instagram post to back Trump in a statement which had a provocative gender remark. The 39-year-old claimed that the now-President ‘treats everybody with respect regardless of their race, age, or either of the two genders.’ The remark came as Trump faced heat for his remarks on gender.Anthony Kim wrote on his Instagram:“Growing up watching TV and hearing about different celebrities, I realised once I started being around them that what the public sees and thinks about someone isn't always true,\" wrote Kim. \"@realdonaldtrump has exceeded my expectations of what it is to be a MAN…While spending time together I saw how he treated everyone including the people I had with me and staff at all his properties. Didn't matter race, age, or either of the two genders. He also gave me advice to which I now wish I listened which included working hard and staying sober as it is a slippery slope.” View this post on Instagram Instagram PostKim further claimed being ‘grateful’ to have known Trump in person. Interestingly, the three-time PGA Tour winner used an image from his LIV Golf Miami 2024 meeting with the now-President while posting the long writeup.","summary":"Anthony Kim is a supporter of President Donald Trump and he’s proven it once again.","url":"https://www.sportskeeda.com/golf/news-liv-golfer-anthony-kim-backs-president-donald-trump-s-stance-latest-ceasefire-announcement","image":"https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2025/06/22964222-1750764419.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-24 12:05:00","author":"Vishnu Mohan","authors":["Vishnu Mohan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.002},{"id":334752862,"title":"New York City’s Mayoral Election Is About Way More Than One City","text":"A few days after the 2024 election, Zohran Mamdani filmed the first video in a mayoral campaign that would come to be defined by them. Standing on street corners in the Bronx and Queens, the 33-year-old Democratic-Socialist state assemblyman asked a procession of New Yorkers two simple questions: Who had they voted for, and why?\n\nThere was nary a MAGA hat in sight. But voter after voter—across a range of ages and backgrounds—explained that they’d either voted for Trump, or not voted at all. They were fed up with the rising cost of living. They wanted an end to the war in Gaza. And they felt like they were getting nothing from Democratic leaders.\n\nThe video, which has more than 2.6 million views on X, was both self-serving and illuminating—a campaign soft-launch rooted in a simple reality: If you want to understand the hole the Democratic Party is currently in, you have to get out of your swing-state bubble and join the Real Americans on the subway. The biggest on-the-ground development of the 2024 election was what happened in the places Democrats took for granted. In blue cities in blue states, President Donald Trump improved his performance among working-class non-white voters while Democratic support fell off dramatically. Trump’s popular-vote victory was an earthquake. And New York City was its epicenter.\n\nTrump picked up nearly 100,000 more votes in his home city than he did four years earlier—while Kamala Harris ran more than half a million votes behind Joe Biden. And the more immigrant and working-class a neighborhood was, the greater the dropoff. The three congressional districts with the biggest swings toward Trump in the entire country last year were all in Queens or the Bronx (or both, in the case of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s 14th district). While the city and the state stayed comfortably blue, the results embodied a worrisome national trend for Trump’s opposition: The places where support for Democrats eroded the fastest were also the places where they have been in power the longest.\n\nOn Tuesday, New York City voters will cast their ballots again, in the biggest contest yet of the party’s post-Trump reset—the Democratic mayoral primary. The race has been, in a lot of ways, a characteristically local affair. The word “re-zoning” comes up a lot. Depending on who you ask, it’s a referendum on Mamdani’s inexperience, former governor Andrew Cuomo’s record of bullying and sexual harassment, or current mayor Eric Adams’ alleged crimes. But it’s also a referendum on where people in America’s biggest Democratic enclave think the Democratic Party went wrong.\n\nYou may not be surprised to learn that Mamdani and Cuomo both think the answer is the other guy. At a rally in Brooklyn last month, in a former steel plant that’s been converted into a concert venue, supporters wore buttons touting Mamdani’s campaign promises—free buses, free childcare, freeze the rent—and swag from the local chapter of Democratic Socialists of America. Aside from a few taxi drivers (whom Mamdani had joined on a hunger strike in 2021), and the candidate’s famous filmmaker mom, it was hard to find anyone who looked older than 40.\n\n“I have a lot of friends in this field—except Cuomo” the Mamdani-endorsing Bronx state Sen. Gustavo Rivera told me, while the actor and Obama White House staffer Kal Penn emceed from the stage. “Cuomo is a piece of human garbage.”\n\nRivera repeated it again, in a sing-song voice this time, to make sure I got the message: “a piece of hu-man gar-bage, who’s an abu-sive bul-ly, who does not deserve to be anywhere near public ser-vice.”\n\nCuomo, the frontrunner, resigned his office in 2021 after an investigation by the state attorney general’s office found that he had sexually harassed 11 women—charges he disputes and says are politically motivated “cancel culture.” To Mamdani and a substantial subset of Democratic voters, Cuomo is the embodiment of how Democrats ended up in their current predicament. \n\n“Democrats are tired of being told by leaders from the past that we should continue to simply wait our turn, we should continue to simply trust, when we know that’s the very leadership that got us to this point,” he said at a debate in June. “We need to turn the page for new leadership to take us out of it.”\n\nMamdani’s campaign is built on addressing what he calls the city’s “affordability crisis”—allowed to fester for too long by Democratic leaders, he believes—with a series of fits-on-a-button proposals that would require some combination of tax increases and political finesse to implement. But Mamdani is also at the vanguard of a generational challenge to the city and state’s old-guard Democratic leadership that’s been brewing since the last shock Trump victory.\n\nCuomo spent years steamrolling his liberal critics as governor. He refused to even shake law professor Zephyr Teachout’s hand in 2014, while a top ally belittled the actress Cynthia Nixon as an “unqualified lesbian” four years later. Those progressives, in turn, believed New York was Blue America’s missed opportunity—a place mired in mediocrity by craven, corrupt, or just out-of-touch party leaders. This lack of ambition was epitomized by Cuomo’s support for members of the Independent Democratic Conference, a rogue faction of state senators who gave Republicans control of the chamber in exchange for legislative perks.\n\nBut in 2018, even as Cuomo cruised to re-election, progressive challengers knocked off six incumbent state senators in the primaries—mostly in the outer boroughs—and helped cement one-party Democratic control of the state government. The biggest jolt came that June, when a Democratic-Socialist bartender, Ocasio-Cortez, upset 10-term Rep. Joe Crowley—the chairman of the Queens Democratic Party. Those wins announced a new force in New York Democratic politics—youthful, diverse, and hungry to do things Democrats had been too timid to try. \n\n“Along the 7 line in Queens, a new Democratic politics is born,” Bloomberg announced that summer. Local DSA members borrowed a slogan from a famous mural in the neighborhood of Jackson Heights: “Queens is the future.”\n\nCuomo’s theory of the race—notwithstanding the fact that he was elected governor three times, his dad was governor, and he has the backing of a bipartisan assemblage of billionaires—is that the party’s plummeting fortunes have less to do with him than with the people who don’t like him.\n\n“They want to go further left. My argument is no, we lost because we were too far left,” he said at a private event earlier this year. “Because we were talking about bathrooms and who was gonna play on what team, boys and girls, you lose touch on what people care about, which is safety.” Cuomo has said that “Defund the police are the three dumbest words ever uttered in politics.” And he’s warned that if taxes on the city’s highest earners are raised like Mamdani wants, “the rich will move to Massachusetts.”\n\nIt’s a message that echoes what a lot of other national Democratic leaders have been saying since November—people like former Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel and California Gov. Gavin Newsom. Cuomo’s campaign launch video was the apocalyptic inverse of Mamdani’s man-on-the-street missive, invoking both the post-pandemic uptick in violent crime (which is now dropping) and the arrival of 230,000 migrant crisis in the city over a two-year period.\n\n“You feel it when you walk down the street and try not to make eye contact with a mentally ill homeless person,” Cuomo says in the video, staring directly into the camera. “Or when the anxiety rises up in your chest as you’re walking down into the subway. You see it in the graffiti, the grime, the migrant influx, the random violence. The city just feels threatening, out of control, and in crisis.” \n\nIt’s a bit more complicated than that. Homelessness is a product of a housing crisis Cuomo presided over, he took money from the subway as governor to bail out ski resorts, and the bail-reform law vilified by some New Yorkers bore his signature. But the pitch is the pitch. The party’s non-white working-class base, he argued, was “paying the highest price for New York’s failed Democratic leadership.”\n\nIf Queens is the future, what exactly is the future telling us? To understand how Democrats lost their groove in New York, I went back to the place where things seemed to be going so well for progressives—the heavily immigrant neighborhoods of Queens that produced Ocasio-Cortez’s 2018 upset. Over the last few months, my colleagues and I spent lot of time talking to residents and elected officials in the neighborhoods of Corona and Jackson Heights for a recent episode of Reveal.\n\nJust off the 7 train on Roosevelt Avenue—the dividing line between AOC’s district and that of Rep. Grace Meng (which also swung 23 points to the right at the presidential level last year)—Trump carried some precincts where he won just a quarter of the vote in 2020. This part of Queens embodied the kinds of places Democrats suffered the most nationally: A large percentage of residents are first- or second-generation immigrants of Latin American or Asian descent, and a comparatively low percentage of voters have college degrees. By one projection, naturalized citizens swung 20 points toward the president last year, while Latino men shifted toward Trump by 16 points.\n\nPart of the story is that while the surrounding neighborhoods formed the symbolic backbone of the city’s new-left politics—Ocasio-Cortez’s campaign hawks stylish Green New Deal prints, depicting high-speed trains whooshing through nearby Flushing Meadows Corona Park—Roosevelt Ave. was also becoming a powerful symbol on the right of perceived failures of progressive governance over the last few years. \n\nThe “influx of migrants” Cuomo mentioned in that video were not evenly distributed across the city. Many of the newcomers, particularly Venezuelans, ended up in places like Corona, where they jostled for space with existing residents and struggled to make ends meet. (Asylum seekers are legally barred from seeking employment for about six months after applying for protection.) Many new immigrants tried to find work as street vendors, but lacked permits. (So did many vendors regardless of immigration status, due to a broken city permitting process—an example of dysfunctional bureaucracy Mamdani has zeroed in on in his campaign). Fox News devoted regular coverage to complaints about trash, crime, and sex workers in the area. It should have been easy to see a backlash coming down the pike. In the final weeks before the presidential election, Roosevelt Avenue’s “numerous brothels” were a punchline on Saturday Night Live.\n\n“I think many people were experiencing and seeing crime go up,” said Jessica González-Rojas, a Democrat who represents part of the area in the state assembly. “With a lot of new arrivals, people were resentful, even those who were immigrants that have been around for generations. I think folks felt like their needs weren’t being addressed, which were the very material needs of the rising prices for food and groceries, rising costs of rent and housing, and again, the increases in crime. Many of us who are progressive have been talking about that, but I think it wasn’t resonating in those same ways.”\n\nPeople felt squeezed on every front. Inflaming all of this was a sense that government hadn’t been there for people when they needed it. The pandemic came up over and over in our conversations. The area was “the epicenter of the epicenter,” as González-Rojas put it—and not by accident. “Essential workers” continued showing up to their jobs while more affluent, white-collar voters adjusted to Zoom. At Elmhurst Hospital, just a few blocks off Roosevelt Ave., so many people died in the first weeks of the pandemic that a mobile morgue unit set up outside. The hospital has just one bed for every thousand residents, noted Shekar Krishnan, the area’s Democratic city councilman, and it was the only facility serving the area. It’s hard to be the party of the social contract when the social contract is in tatters.\n\n“There was a sense of almost lawlessness, right?” González-Rojas said. “Like you saw people blow through red lights. Crime ticked up. There was just a lack of order that something about the pandemic caused.” \n\nCatalina Cruz, a progressive who represents a neighboring assembly district that includes parts of Corona argued that the pandemic response “had a lot of people disillusioned with government.” Ongoing detachment and disinvestment was layered onto existing inequities, and raised questions about who politicians really worked for. “Andrew Cuomo never stepped foot in Corona. Even during the pandemic, I had to fight him to get a vaccination site in my district. I had to fight him and [former mayor] Bill de Blasio.” (Politico recently reported that Cuomo had in fact attempted to block a vaccination site from opening at nearby Citi Field, because the site was de Blasio’s idea and not his.)\n\nWhat exactly you think of as “disorder” can vary a lot. But it’s something that everyone from the progressives to the reactionaries seemed to agree there was more of after the pandemic—or at least that people felt like there was more of. And there was a propulsive quality to that anxiety. A recent piece in Vital City called New York City’s malaise an example of “negative social contagion”—essentially, the city has been so overwhelmed by bad vibes that the bad vibes were beginning to call the shots.\n\nWhen we talked to shopkeepers in Corona about what they wanted from the next mayor, public safety was the top concern. It wasn’t just a bit of New York Post-driven hysteria: Major felonies nearly doubled in this police precinct after the pandemic. An Ecuadorean immigrant who sold soccer jerseys said she had been robbed three times in the last few years. Another voter we spoke with, a formerly undocumented immigrant named Mauricio Zamora who had voted for Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and Joe Biden after getting his citizenship, told us he switched to Trump because he felt like Democrats weren’t doing enough about crime. He’d formed a local community group to agitate against sex workers and “vagrants,” and he was leaning toward Cuomo.\n\nThere’s plenty for progressives to grapple with in stories like these. The fact that Mamdani is facing millions of dollars in attack ads featuring a five-year-old call to “#DefundtheNYPD” perhaps offers some lessons for aspiring lefty politicians when it comes to public safety messaging. But New York’s uneasy lurch presents a lot of challenges for status-quo Democrats too. These neighborhoods offer a glimpse of what happens when you don’t deliver on progressive policy promises—and when people feel ignored by their leaders. Zamora, for instance, supported a path to citizenship for undocumented residents, and was so frustrated that none of the Democrats he’d voted for in the past had delivered on it that he had stopped believing their promises.\n\n“When you have a former president promising us we are gonna have immigration reform within the first a hundred days and four years later, we have nothing to show for it, people remember that,” Cruz, who was once undocumented herself, said of Biden. To her, national Democrats were dealing with the fruits of patronizing and ultimately empty leadership. Instead of showing up, they were just “sending 10,000 text messages telling us that it’s doomsday because we’re not sending $10 for you to do whatever the hell you’re doing.”\n\nIt’s hard to overstate just how dysfunctional the party is in the city and the state. In 1953, 93 percent of eligible voters participated in the mayoral election; in 2021, just 23 percent did. That disengagement is part of what made the left’s outer-borough rise possible—AOC won her primary in 2018 through hard work, yes, but also because the head of the Queens Democratic Party couldn’t even rustle up 13,000 people to vote for him. The New York State Democratic Party spent money on a 2018 primary mailer accusing Cynthia Nixon of enabling anti-semitism (which the party said was a mistake), but then spent nothing on three losing statewide ballot initiatives in 2021. Afterwards, Jay Jacobs, the party’s Cuomo-loving chair, explained that it had only spent $0 on key Democratic priorities conservatives had spent nine-figures attacking because no one had asked the party to spend more.\n\nFaced with the fruits of their poor choices, party leaders have sometimes made peace with mediocrity. “We did well in Southern Brooklyn,” Brooklyn Democratic Party chair Rodneyse Bichotte Hermelyn—a Cuomo-backing state assemblywoman—said in November, after an election in which Democrats lost a state senate seat in the borough for the first time in eight years, and failed to even field a candidate in an assembly district where Democrats held a three-to-one registration advantage over Republicans. “He did a great job as chair, and he continues as chair,” Gov. Kathy Hochul said of Jacobs, after the party’s table-setting collapse in the midterms two years earlier. Last September, with the party careening toward another setback, Jacobs was reelected to his post again.\n\nThe problems of disillusionment and disengagement are particularly salient in New York, but they are a problem for Democrats in blue cities more broadly. In the counties that include Los Angeles and Chicago, nearly a million Democrats stayed home in 2024—and support fell dramatically in predominantly Black and Latino neighborhoods. Just 16.5 percent of voters showed up for a recent municipal election in Philadelphia, where flagging turnout and eroding support helped cost Democrats a Senate seat last year. (“Turnout doesn’t bother me, only bothers me [that] we win” Bob Brady, the city’s Democratic party boss, told the Philadelphia Inquirer.) Even more than the choice between Cuomo and Mamdani, the biggest indicator of whether Democrats are getting their act together might be how many of them show up to vote at all.\n\nThat’s not to say that everything happening in New York tells a story about everywhere else. This is a place that just discovered the existence of trash bins, but still can’t decide whether they’re good or not. (If elected, Cuomo has said he would scrap containerization requirements for “small properties.”) But all of the crosscurrents that have swamped the party over the last eight years are present in New York in an unavoidable way. It’s a test not just of left vs. center, but of the desire for change vs. doubling down, of new blood vs. wait-your-turn, of outsiders vs. insiders. This is where the pandemic hit hardest, first, and where the tangled immigration policies of the Biden era viscerally fell apart. Crime, housing costs, grocery bills, apathy—these were the tests Democrats failed in their backyards before they failed everywhere else.\n\nFor a long time, it has been tempting, in a world of red-and-blue electoral maps and swing-state fixations, for politicians to alternatively write off places like New York and take them for granted—a wellspring of safe votes and big checks. But the lesson of 2024 was a cautionary one: If you can’t make it here, you can’t make it anywhere.\n\nAdditional reporting by Noah Lanard and Nadia Hamdan.","summary":"A few days after the 2024 election, Zohran Mamdani filmed the first video in a mayoral campaign that would come to be defined by them.

Scientific progress is the biggest driver of overall progress; it’s hugely exciting to think about how much more we could have. … \n\n“[T]he 2030s are likely going to be wildly different from any time that has come before. We do not know how far beyond human-level intelligence we can go, but we are about to find out. …\n\n“The rate of new wonders being achieved will be immense. It’s hard to even imagine today what we will have discovered by 2035; maybe we will go from solving high-energy physics one year to beginning space colonization the next year; or from a major materials science breakthrough one year to true high-bandwidth brain-computer interfaces the next year. Many people will choose to live their lives in much the same way, but at least some people will probably decide to ‘plug in’.”\n\nAnd to Altman’s point, from news rooms to toy manufacturers, society is already adopting AI technology at a rapid pace. According to Oxford’s Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism in its 2025 Digital News Report, “AI chatbots and interfaces [are] emerging as a source of news as search engines and other platforms integrate real-time news,” with seven percent saying they use AI for news each week. And that number is “much higher with under-25s (15%).”\n\nLater pivoting to potential pitfalls, Altman, like others, mentioned the difficulty that will come from “whole classes of jobs going away,” but unlike most, he quickly dismisses this, contending we will all be so much “richer” as a result of technological advancement. What then are the “serious challenges” humanity will face going forward, according to Altman?\n\nAltman mentions two: (1) Safety issues, or what he refers to as the “alignment problem,” whether “we can robustly guarantee that we get AI systems to learn and act towards what we collectively really want over the long-term[;]” and (2) making sure to “widely distribute access to superintelligence given the economic implications.”\n\nBoth appear at first to be laudable goals, and indeed, Altman is correct in asserting that wide accessibility is paramount. But what if the vast majority of people do “decide to ‘plug in’”?\n\nIn building on the previous installment from this column, it becomes glaringly clear the problems with both Atlman’s notion of how to solve the “alignment problem” and with making sure there is wide distribution so that everyone is able to “plug in.”\n\nStarting with wide distribution, society is already revealing cracks in the promise Altman sees with AI.\n\n Earlier this year, AI “deepfakes” — among other pressures — led to the passage of the TAKE IT DOWN Act, a federal law prohibiting the nonconsensual publication of intimate images, which includes “digital forgeries” using AI, according to the Congressional Research Service Legal Sidebar.\n\n Just this past weekend, news out of the UK revealed that thousands of university students had been caught cheating using AI. “A survey of academic integrity violations found almost 7,000 proven cases of cheating using AI tools in 2023-24, equivalent to 5.1 for every 1,000 students,” reported The Guardian. “That was up from 1.6 cases per 1,000 in 2022-23.”\n\n Have you heard the new startling relationship news? In a CBS Saturday Morning report, ChatGPT user Chris Smith told the outlet that he actually thinks he fell in “love” with a chatbot named “Sol” that he programmed and affectionately refers to as a “her.” \n\n The kicker: Much like how many have become so reliant on tech that they can’t travel to the grocery store and back home without using a GPS, is it even a surprise that AI may be eroding our critical thinking skills? TIME reported Tuesday that “[a] new study from researchers at MIT’s Media Lab has returned some concerning results.” The results? “Researchers used an EEG to record the writers’ brain activity across 32 regions, and found that of the three groups, ChatGPT users had the lowest brain engagement and ‘consistently underperformed at neural, linguistic, and behavioral levels,’ according to TIME. “Over the course of several months, ChatGPT users got lazier with each subsequent essay, often resorting to copy-and-paste by the end of the study.” \n\nBut that’s not even the alarming part.\n\nAs far as the “alignment problem” goes, who decides what AI systems learn and act towards?\n\nLike with any new technology, how the tool is used determines the vastness of its utility for good or for evil … which is precisely the point, and the problem.\n\nAltman claims the solution is for the “collective” to decide, which sounds like a remark straight out of the communist playbook. \n\nAnd let’s not forget, then-Vice President Kamala Harris’s seemingly unwittingly let slip the biggest problem with AI: that AI could be used as a tool to determine people’s opinions if fed certain information during the input process.\n\nAs American Family News Reporter/Anchor Steve Jordahl put it in a recent piece, “It’s all about who’s pulling the strings.”\n\nAnd right now, as numerous MRC Free Speech America reports have consistently shown, that means the left is pulling the strings. Billionaire AI owner Elon Musk recently admitted in an X post that even “Grok is parroting legacy media.”\n\nFree speech advocates the world over have their work cut out for them. The free speech battle has just reached another phase, and the MRC will continue to take it on at every turn.\n\nConservatives are under attack!

Reed Jobs, 33, and Erin Jobs, 29, will likely be at the wedding. However it's currently not known if her half sibling Lisa Brennan-Jobs, 47, will attend.\nAside from her siblings, Eve has a plethora of high-profile friends descended from other tech billionaires - including Jennifer and Phoebe Gates, the daughters of Microsoft founder Bill Gates, who will likely be in attendance.\nIn 2023, Eve was spotted mingling amongst high society's wealthiest members at a gala in New York City, including Rupert Murdoch's ex-wife Wendi Deng, who she struck a pose with for photos, and Lili Buffett, the granddaughter of billionaire investor and philanthropist Warren Buffet.\nFormer US vice president Kamala Harris is also expected to attend the event thanks to her long-time friendship with Eve's mother and one of the richest people in the world, Laurene Powell Jobs.\nLaurene and Kamala have been friends for more than 20 years, with the billionaire philanthropist backing Kamala's run for US presidency last year, which she eventually lost to President Donald Trump.\nAnd while Eve is tech royalty, there may even be real royalty at her and Harry's wedding. According to Tatler, Princess Beatrice and Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi are expected to attend too.\nOn top of Eve's impressive connections, Harry has his own entourage who will surely bring the party. His father is Peter Charles, whose team won Britain's first team jumping gold medal for 60 years at the 2012 London Summer Olympics.\nHis Olympic teammates Scott Brash and Ben Maher may also attend, having claimed victory in team jumping together at the Paris Olympics.\nNo details have been released about Eve's bridal style yet, but a designer collaboration is surely in the works for the fashion model.\nEve also frequently appears on front row seats at Paris Fashion Week, attended her first Met Gala in 2022, and is regularly seen at the Vanity Fair Oscars Party wearing designers such as Molly Goddard and vintage Donna Karan.\n\nEve and Harry are set to tie the knot in the Cotswolds this summer, with a guest list full of the rich and famous\nShe may even go in another direction entirely and pay tribute to her late father, who died in 2011 when she was just 12 years old, and wear something from his favourite designer, Issey Miyake.\nThe iconic Japanese designer, who died in 2022 at the age of 84, was behind Steve's iconic black turtleneck uniform that 'helped make him the world's most recognisable CEO', according to Gawker.\nHowever, neither Eve nor Harry have divulged any details on what their wedding looks will entail at the time or reporting.\nEve, a self-described 'horse girl', started riding when she was just six years old and had made some considerable achievements, including winning a bronze medal in the team event at the 2019 Pan American Games in Lima, Peru.\nShe was front and centre to watch Harry win his gold medal last year and shared a loving post on Instagram with the caption: 'TEAM GOLD!!!!!!

Media watchdogs differ on show's influence","text":"Bill Maher suggested that Democrats should \"do something\" about ABC News’ \"The View\" if the party wants to distance itself from far-left rhetoric that turns off many voters, but media watchdogs feel the Disney-funded program offers a promotional platform too powerful to pass up. Maher claimed on Friday that Democrats took a step \"back to sanity\" after The New York Times took a more \"sensible liberal, not crazy woke\" position on transgender issues. He then asserted that the second step Democrats should take is to \"do something about ‘The View’\" after Whoopi Goldberg recently claimed life for Black Americans is equivalent to women living under Iran's oppressive theocratic regime. Goldberg’s comment, which received pushback from co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin, is the latest polarizing remark from the daytime program that wields significant influence over Democrats. The show sparks controversy and generates tabloid fodder on a regular basis, but is also weighty enough that some feel Kamala Harris would have had a better chance against President Trump if she didn’t fumble when asked by co-host Sunny Hostin to differentiate herself from then-President Joe Biden during an October interview. BILL MAHER SAYS DEMOCRATS NEED TO 'DO SOMETHING' ABOUT 'THE VIEW' AFTER WHOOPI GOLDBERG'S IRAN COMMENTS Independent journalist Tara Palmeri, who authors \"The Red Letter\" on Substack and hosts \"The Tara Palmeri Show,\" said that stopping by \"The View\" when promoting a book or trying to drum up support before an election is simply \"part of the political circuit, the same way that Bill Maher is,\" and that the notion Democrats need to distance themselves from the daytime gabfest is a bridge too far. \"Whoopi and Joy and the others, they feel like they can say whatever they want, which they can -- it’s a free country, but it doesn’t reflect the conversation at any dinner table unless you’re in Brooklyn or Seattle,\" Palmeri told Fox News Digital. \"It reflects a very rarefied group of people who live in New York City, and they have a conversation that is led primarily by very liberal voices, and they can make comments that are kind of outlandish, but… on the right, you see that as well,\" Palmeri continued, noting that there are plenty of panel-style opinion programs hosted by conservatives. \"So what about what Whoopi thinks? You don’t have to agree with her. You can go on ‘The View’ and actually engage with her in a way that points out the unreasonability of her comment, or the shock value of it, and if you actually win that debate, and you’re a Democrat, I think it shows you’re a more moderate voice,\" Palmeri said. \"She represents, obviously, a part of the part that’s further to the left,\" Palmeri added. \"You had John Fetterman come on the show, and he was able to hold his own with them, and I don’t think he was going on to get the approval of Whoopi. I think he was going on to talk to a female audience.\" WHOOPI GOLDBERG REBUKED BY IRANIAN DISSIDENTS FOR COMPARING LIFE IN THE US TO IRAN Media Research Center associate editor Nicholas Fondacaro, who monitors \"The View\" for the conservative media watchdog, feels Democrats would be wise to listen to Maher. \"ABC has allowed The View to craft a fantasy world for themselves where the wealthy celebrities are somehow oppressed and on the verge of becoming political prisoners,\" Fondacaro told Fox News Digital. \"The show promotes a toxic victim mentality that leads them to think they’re treated worse in America than they would be in Iran, all while shouting it on a national TV show,\" he continued. \"Democrats would be best served by distancing themselves from the show, especially when they make comments like Sunny Hostin, who suggested that opposing wokeness is ‘ungodly.’\" But Fondacaro doesn’t expect Democrats to take his advice anytime soon. 'THE VIEW' INSIDER SOUNDS ALARM AS DISNEY BOSS URGES HOSTS TO COOL OFF POLITICAL CHATTER \"The fact that the show is so sycophantic in pushing leftist political dogma and on one of the major news networks in America, the show provides too good of an opportunity to promote themselves for Democrats to pass up,\" Fondacaro said. Last month, a \"View\" source told Fox News Digital that ABC News honchos wanted the program to tone down the political rhetoric. But despite the internal discussions, \"The View\" has maintained its reliably critical coverage of Trump and his administration in recent weeks. Heritage Foundation media fellow Tim Young said the ABC News program \"seems to have become the testing ground for far left\" talking points. \"But if you look at how the demographics drastically shifted toward President Trump in the last election, you would think the left would wake up, cancel the show, and run their propaganda through much more reasonable voices,\" Young continued. \"The problem is, there aren’t more reasonable voices on the left at the moment.\" ‘THE VIEW MELTS DOWN OVER LATEST BIDEN BOOK, SLAMS CNN FOR ’HAWKING' IT As for why \"The View\" is dominated by liberal voices, Palmeri said a lot of it comes down to the fact that the show’s outspoken liberals have been around for years, while \"conservative women don’t tend to fare well\" on the panel. Farah Griffin, the current token conservative voice, has only been on the program since 2022 and isn’t exactly a fan of President Trump, as she previously worked for the Trump administration before publicly turning on him. Co-host Ana Navarro, a former GOP strategist, has been one of the most blunt critics of Trump and the GOP since she was named a regular panelist three years ago. \"The people who have stayed around the longest have been liberal voices, they sort of dominate the table,\" Palmeri said.

In some instances, the data could be leveraged to enhance the federal government's immigration enforcement efforts — a break with longstanding norms and practices that also raises legal questions.\n\n\"Every week we're seeing new examples of this administration demanding or sharing sensitive government data for unprecedented uses,\" said Nicole Schneidman, who heads the technology and data governance team at Protect Democracy, a non-profit legal center that describes its mission as \"defeating the authoritarian threat.\"\n\nSchneidman said Americans should understand \"the data that they have entrusted to state governments right now is truly a target.\"\n\nFor instance, the Department of Agriculture told states last month they will need to turn over the names, Social Security numbers, addresses and dates of birth of the tens of millions of people who applied for federal food aid under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) over the last five years — or potentially risk losing federal funds.\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement has issued subpoenas to states and localities for records that include the personal information of noncitizens, including for sensitive details on applicants to a California program that gives monthly support to low income, elderly or disabled legal immigrants who do not qualify for Social Security payments.\n\nAnd earlier this month, federal health officials shared data about millions of Medicaid recipients from a handful of states with the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees immigration enforcement.\n\nAiding in Trump's effort to consolidate data is an executive order the president signed in March, \"Stopping Waste, Fraud and Abuse by Eliminating Information Silos,\" which calls for the federal government to have \"unfettered access\" to data from state programs that receive federal funds, including datasets held by third parties.\n\nThe order says data sharing can help eliminate \"bureaucratic duplication and inefficiency while enhancing the Government's ability to detect overpayments and fraud.\"\n\nWhile data sharing across government entities can create efficiencies, it also risks running afoul of federal laws, which are supposed to guard against the federal government having unconstrained access to personal data.\n\nUnder the Privacy Act of 1974, federal agencies are supposed to tell the public how they intend to use and safeguard personal data before they begin collecting it, and are not supposed to use data beyond that purpose.\n\nPrivacy experts warn of dramatic implications if federal agencies are able to seize the sensitive data currently held only by states and use it broadly without constraint. One fear is that the data could be used by the federal government to create powerful surveillance tools that could be used on all Americans.\n\n\"Once this kind of data is in the wrong hands and in particular is aggregated, it can be used for an incredibly broad ranging set of purposes,\" Schneidman of Protect Democracy said. \"It is critical for every American to understand there is no 'undo' button here.\"\n\nIn other countries data has been used to \"quash dissent at scale,\" Schneidman said.\n\nWhite House spokesperson Taylor Rogers defended the Trump administration's data efforts and dismissed critics as biased.\n\n\"President Trump is streamlining data collection across all agencies to increase government efficiency and save hard-earned taxpayer dollars,\" Rogers wrote in an email. \"The Trump Administration is committed to protecting the privacy of Americans.\"\n\nLeveraging data to track immigrants \n\nFor months, the Trump administration has been consolidating data across the federal government with the stated goal of rooting out waste, fraud and abuse, including searching for cases of ineligible noncitizens fraudulently receiving public benefits. At the same time, the effort could also help the administration track noncitizens and scale up deportations.\n\nInitially helmed by tech billionaire Elon Musk, the administration's Department of Government Efficiency has played a key role in merging federal databases for these purposes.\n\nDOGE has gained access to several major federal databases, and earlier this year, the Department of Homeland Security brokered agreements with the Internal Revenue Service and Housing and Urban Development to get data on noncitizens.\n\nThis month's Medicaid data transfer appears to be among the largest known cases yet of sensitive data from states being shared across federal agencies.\n\nTop officials at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services ordered staff at the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services to share with DHS sensitive data from a handful of states about millions of their Medicaid enrollees, according to reporting by The Associated Press.\n\nThe data pertains to Medicaid recipients in California, Illinois, Washington and Washington, D.C., according to the AP report. Those jurisdictions allow some noncitizens who do not qualify for federal Medicaid to enroll in a version of the program that is funded by the state. (All states receive federal funding to use for emergency care, which can treat low-income patients regardless of their immigration status.)\n\nA number of state officials have voiced outrage that the state data was shared with DHS.\n\n\"CMS has long promised the public that it is committed to protecting the integrity and privacy of its data, including not sharing it for immigration enforcement purposes,\" Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services spokesperson Melissa Kula wrote in an email, adding that the state agency is \"deeply concerned.\"\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom called the move \"legally dubious\" and in a letter sent last week, the state's U.S. senators alleged it may have violated the federal Privacy Act of 1974, the Social Security Act and the health privacy law known as HIPAA. The senators called on DHS to destroy the Medicaid data it received.\n\nPublic information officers from California, Illinois and Washington told NPR they still have not been notified by CMS about the data transfer and therefore could not confirm what data DHS holds. States routinely must share detailed data about Medicaid enrollees with CMS, including names, addresses, Social Security numbers and immigration status, under the expectation that it will remain confidential and secure.\n\nHealth and Human Services spokesperson Andrew Nixon called the transfer \"lawful interagency data sharing with DHS\" and said it was part of an effort by CMS director Mehmet Oz to crack down on states \"that may be misusing federal Medicaid funds to subsidize care for illegal immigrants.\"\n\nOz announced that priority in late May, citing a presidential executive action that calls for federal agencies to ensure federal public benefits are not being accessed by immigrants in the country illegally.\n\nNixon denied the data transfer to DHS was \"unprecedented\" in his statement, but declined to respond to an NPR request to explain what the precedent was, or clarify what Medicaid data was shared. \n\nIn a statement to NPR, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said, \"CMS and DHS are exploring an initiative to ensure that illegal aliens are not receiving Medicaid benefits that are meant for law-abiding Americans\" but did not respond to questions about the specifics of what data was received.\n\nSharing sensitive Medicaid data that was collected by CMS to administer the program with another federal agency would be \"a totally unauthorized repurposing of this data,\" said Jeffrey Grant, a former CMS official who left earlier this year after working there for 30 years. \"You cannot just hand data over.\"\n\nPrivacy and democracy advocates who have been warning about the potential for federal data grabs at the state level in recent months saw the Medicaid data transfer to DHS last week as a turning point.\n\n\"This is exactly why privacy advocates have been sounding the alarm about this administration's unprecedentedly boundless approach to collecting people's data,\" said Elizabeth Laird, director of equity in civic technology at the nonprofit Center for Democracy and Technology.\n\n\"Not only will this discourage states from cooperating with the federal government going forward, it will lead people to miss out on life-saving benefits they're entitled to as they can't trust that their information won't be used against them,\" Laird said.\n\nThe disclosure of Medicaid data to immigration authorities comes as Congress is weighing massive cuts to that program and other parts of the federal social safety net.\n\n\"If your goal is a policy program that supports the most vulnerable people in society, this approach makes no sense whatsoever,\" Ami Fields-Meyer, a senior fellow at the Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation at Harvard University specializing in the intersection between civil liberties and technology, and a former senior policy adviser to Vice President Kamala Harris, recently told NPR.\n\n\"But if you're trying to integrate critical assistance into a machinery for hunting immigrants and breaking up families and deporting people without due process — this is exactly how you do it.\"\n\nNew models for demanding state data\n\nThe revelations about Medicaid data follow new data-sharing guidance USDA issued to states last month to turn over personal information about tens of millions of SNAP recipients. Several states have announced their intent to comply with the USDA's unprecedented demand, but the plan is also getting pushback.\n\nAfter a federal lawsuit accused USDA's data demand of violating federal privacy laws, a senior official said in court filings that data would not be collected until the department satisfied legal requirements and could ensure the data would be appropriately safeguarded.\n\nRecently, the USDA published a public notice, as is required by the Privacy Act, of its intent to collect the data. The notice says the department will check SNAP applicants against federal databases to verify eligibility, including checking immigration status and finding duplicate enrollments. The wording of the notice suggests the collected data can be used much more broadly than past department data sets.\n\nSeparately, USDA's Office of Inspector General is continuing to press certain states for personal data on SNAP participants for the stated goal of evaluating the quality and integrity of the data, according to emails reviewed by NPR. In at least one state, the data request includes citizenship status and information about household members, but not other information that's used to determine eligibility, such as employment status or income, the emails show.\n\nCritics of this administration's data sharing efforts have pointed out that Project 2025, the sprawling proposed template drafted by conservative activists for Trump's second term, suggested gaining access to new sources of state data for purposes that include immigration enforcement.\n\nThe document says the federal government should make certain federal grants to states and localities contingent on \"total information-sharing in the context of both federal law enforcement and immigration enforcement,\" including \"access to department of motor vehicles and voter registration databases.\"\n\nThose objectives echo data requests the first Trump administration made to states, when there was a push for states to share DMV and voter information, but most states refused.\n\nNow in Trump's second term, federal agencies, including DOGE and DHS have begun analyzing state voter rolls to look for noncitizens, as directed by Trump's executive order on elections. Separately, the Department of Justice sent an unprecedented request to Colorado for all its election records last month.\n\nLegal and privacy issues raise dilemmas for states\n\nData sharing across federal agencies and with states can be an invaluable tool, said Allan Medina, a former federal prosecutor who is now a partner at Goodwin, a law firm, but he cautioned it has to be done appropriately.\n\nAs a federal prosecutor, Medina worked in a strike force alongside HHS's Office of Inspector General, FBI and other state and federal law enforcement partners to investigate medical device companies defrauding Medicaid. But he said in that context, everyone involved had been trained about how to safeguard sensitive tax and health data and understood the limits of how they were legally allowed to be used.\n\nHe said Trump's executive order on eliminating data silos raises questions on who exactly is receiving the sensitive data. \"It could be whomever, [it] could be people within DOGE,\" Medina said. \"Are they trained? What are the training protocols?\"\n\nWhile there have been more than a dozen lawsuits challenging DOGE's data access on privacy grounds, court rulings have been mixed. After a federal judge in Maryland temporarily stopped DOGE from accessing sensitive information at the Social Security Administration, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed that ruling, allowing DOGE unfettered access.\n\nThe unprecedented data requests from the federal governments are causing states to carefully consider their responses, especially if they risk violating state privacy laws by inappropriately turning over records.\n\nColorado is evaluating how to respond to a detailed data request for its Medicaid data, according to Colorado Public Radio.\n\nSeparately, Colorado's labor director has argued an ICE subpoena asking for personal information of sponsors of child migrants is illegal under state law, and sued the state's Democratic governor, Jared Polis, for instructing him to respond to it.\n\nCity officials in Chicago have told news outlets they have not responded to an ICE subpoena for records from a city ID program used in large part by immigrants, including those without legal status.\n\nSuch ICE subpoenas to states, cities and counties to get records for groups or programs appears to be a new tactic, said Lindsay Nash, a law professor at Cardozo School of Law who has done extensive research into ICE's use of subpoenas.\n\n\"There's reasons that these subpoenas very well may be invalid,\" Nash said. She says states should carefully consider how to respond and should prioritize protecting information.\n\nSome states are trying to be proactive.\n\nBefore Illinois' Medicaid data reportedly wound up in the hands of DHS, Gov. JB Pritzker — a Democrat and prominent critic of the administration — issued an executive order to protect the data privacy of individuals with autism after federal health officials announced plans to use Medicaid and Medicare data for a new database for autism research.\n\nMaryland's Department of Human Services sent a letter to its vendors, grantees, contractors and community partners saying personally identifiable information and protected health information, \"should be kept confidential and not shared, disclosed or accessed, except in accordance with the contract and applicable law.\"\n\nLaird, of the Center for Democracy and Technology, said an important factor in how this shakes out is how states choose to react to data requests.\n\nDuring Trump's first term, officials from red and blue states pushed back on the idea of sharing sensitive data on voters, including birth dates and partial Social Security numbers, with a federal commission on election integrity.\n\nMississippi's Republican secretary of state at the time, Delbert Hosemann, said his response would be, \"They can go jump in the Gulf of Mexico and Mississippi is a great state to launch from.\"\n\nThis time around, states have to weigh the threat of losing federal funds if they do not comply with certain requests or potential litigation.\n\nStill, Laird said she wonders if that spirit of resistance to federal data requests will persist.\n\n\"Will we continue to see the bipartisan value of really limiting who has access to very sensitive information continue?\" Laird asked. \"Or has there been a sea change?\"\n\nHave a tip you want to share with NPR?

Another 37.8 per cent of potential voters said they were either “not sure yet” or “not voting”.\n\nAccording to Anderson, “Given the closeness of the current voter support between the two parties, there is some degree of variation within the demographic groups with regard to this support. The PNP’s support comes mainly from males, 40 per cent, as against 28 per cent for the JLP; amongst the 55-64 age group, 39 per cent against 28 per cent for the JLP; and amongst persons in the 25-34 age group, 31 per cent saying they will vote for the PNP, compared to 27 per cent for the JLP.”\n\nIn his analysis, the pollster said, “The Opposition PNP has maintained a steady lead in the polls since it narrowly won the popular vote in the local government elections in February last year. That lead moved to seven percentage points two months later in April 2024, and again increased to nine [percentage points] in the September 2024 national poll. However, in two polls conducted since the start of 2025, that lead by the PNP has been cut to 5.4 percentage points in February 2025 and has been further reduced to three percentage points in the recently concluded poll, fieldwork for which was completed between the 16th of May and the 7th of June 2025.”\n\nDr Christopher Charles, University of the West Indies professor of political and social psychology, said the results give the Opposition an electoral edge, but affirmed what he has long believed: the general election will be a very close contest.\n\nHe noted that in polling terms, when one party repeatedly leads by small but consistent margins, even within the statistical margin of error, it often signals a likely victory. \n\n“The same thing occurred in the November 2024 US presidential election, where the polls showed a close race between [Kamala] Harris and [Donald] Trump, with the majority of the polls consistently showing Trump having a few more points within the margin of error (and some more than the margin of error), which was suggestive of a likely Trump win, which is what occurred. These four poll findings are also consistent with the PNP getting a larger share of the popular vote in the local government elections in early 2024,” Charles told The Gleaner.\n\nLooking at the demographics, Anderson noted that the JLP’s support comes mainly from females, with “31 per cent saying they will vote for the JLP, compared to 27 per cent for the PNP.\n\n“[Further] amongst the 45-54 age group, where the JLP has a four percentage point lead over the PNP, and also amongst the younger voters, where 26 per cent say they intend to vote for the JLP as against 22 per cent for the PNP.”\n\nHe noted, “This latter age cohort, the youngest voters, have shown some degree of volatility in polls conducted in the last year, swinging between the JLP and the PNP. This is against the background of the last five years, where they have tended to support the JLP more often.”\n\nAmong individuals who said they would vote for the PNP, the anti-incumbency sentiment was the strongest factor at 29.1 per cent, followed by party loyalty at 24.2 per cent. Another 22.2 per cent felt the the PNP should be given a chance to govern. \n\nAt the same time, among those who said they would vote for the JLP, 22.9 per cent said it was because the governing party was doing a good job while 22.3 per cent said their main reason was party loyalty. Another 21.3 per cent said they wanted to see the government continue the projects it has started. \n\n Diehard support split between parties \n\nThe diehard support among voters 65 years and over, who have traditionally been strongly in favour of the PNP, was this time around divided, with one percentage point separating them in their voter intent, with the advantage still to the PNP.\n\n“It is interesting to note that despite the intensification of the political activity by both parties during 2025, that actual numbers that say “will vote” for either party has fallen off. The PNP support/voter intent has fallen off by 2.1 percentage points since the last poll in February, while the JLP has seen a smaller fall off of less than one [percentage point],” Anderson noted.\n\n Volatility \n\nThe pollster believes it is “counter-intuitive, as it would normally be expected that increased political activity would result in a higher level of commitment to vote for one party or the other”. \n\n“In reality, what has taken place is that as the campaign has been revved up, this has created a heightened degree of uncertainty amongst the voters as to which side to support and, for the moment, more are now sitting on the fence, uncertain as to which party to support. It simply means that the undecided [voters] have grown since the last poll conducted in February. Note that the JLP’s support has remained roughly steady at 30 per cent, whilst the decline has been largely with the PNP.”\n\nBeyond the numbers, Charles said tensions within the JLP in settling on several prospective candidates may be undermining its campaign and affecting voter confidence. There were tensions in Clarendon North Western, Westmoreland Western, Clarendon Central and St Andrew North Central, some resulting in public quarrels.\n\nThis, he said, contrasted against a seemingly more united PNP, whose candidate selection process was relatively smooth, but not without their own problems in Kingston Central, where formerly tipped candidate Lawrence Rowe was replaced with retired senior cop Steve McGregor.\n\nPolitical commentator and publisher Lloyd B Smith was more succinct.\n\n“Both parties have failed so far to excite the electorate,” he told The Gleaner yesterday.\n\n“At the same time, the fact that the PNP remains in striking distance given the margin of error would suggest strongly that the incumbency syndrome is working in its favour, which should be worrying to the JLP. If this trend continues, the country can expect a very low voter turnout, which would tend to favour the PNP, especially if the youth vote does not live up to expectations for the JLP,” said Smith, a former MP elected on a PNP ticket.\n\nGetting young voters to the polling station is very difficult, Smith stressed.\n\n“It is no secret that it is harder to get out the youth vote, which is why the spectre of vote-buying may well rear its ugly head. In the final analysis, while the PNP may be seeing a light at the end of the tunnel, the JLP should be worried, given its massive public relations campaign, which has so far failed to give Holness a competitive edge,” he explained.\n\nWith each party expected to go into high campaign gear, Smith said both parties will gain some momentum, more so the JLP, as the PNP President Mark Golding’s popularity may remain an Achilles heel for the party.\n\nHolness has a 7.5 percentage point lead over Golding in favourability, but Golding has a slight 0.2 percentage point better net favourability rating, according to the latest poll.\n\nOver the period of the poll, 1,033 persons age 18 years and over, who are registered to vote, were interviewed. All parishes were covered in the sample and the margin of error was plus or minus three per cent at the 95 confidence level.\n\n erica.virtue@gleanerjm.com","summary":"With just weeks left within which the next general election is due to be announced, much-anticipated party standings put the ruling Jamaica Labour Party (JLP) and Opposition People’s National Party (PNP) in a close race as the PNP holds a three...","url":"https://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/lead-stories/20250624/tightening","image":"https://jamaica-gleaner.com/sites/default/files/styles/250px/public/media/article_images/2025/06/24/3165225/8327017.jpg?itok=ms4pFXkD","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-24 05:13:50","author":"Erica Virtue","authors":["Erica Virtue"],"language":"en","category":"sports","source_country":"jm","sentiment":-0.15},{"id":334805030,"title":"Doug Emhoff joins USC Gould faculty as Distinguished Visiting Professor","text":"The USC Gould School of Law has announced that Douglas Emhoff (JD 1990), accomplished attorney and former Second Gentleman of the United States, will join the faculty as Distinguished Visiting Professor of Law.

With a professional background whose work intersects private practice, public service and higher education, Emhoff offers unique insight into the current professional landscape and the role of lawyers in our society and democracy.\n\nDuring his tenure as Second Gentleman, Emhoff represented the Biden-Harris Administration around the country and in diplomatic engagements around the world. Emhoff led the Administration’s efforts to combat antisemitism and other forms of hate, including the development of the first-ever National Strategy to Combat Antisemitism; advocated for equal access to legal aid and the removal of legal barriers in the justice system; promoted small businesses and the arts; convened religious leaders for interfaith dialogues; and advanced U.S. sports diplomacy efforts, including by representing the United States at the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris and the 2023 Women’s World Cup in New Zealand. And, throughout the 107 days of Vice President Kamala Harris’s presidential campaign, he crisscrossed the nation campaigning for his wife, engaging with diverse communities, building coalitions, and speaking on behalf of her historic campaign.\n\nPrior to his public service, Emhoff spent more than three decades as a lawyer, advising companies and leaders in business and technology hubs worldwide, managing high-profile disputes and solving complex problems across entertainment, media, sports, technology and business.\n\nThroughout the years, Emhoff has played an active role in the life of USC’s law school.

If you do not understand that Trump and his movement are fascist, you do not understand fascism. I am writing this in regards to a remarkable dissonance in liberal institutions that speaks to the abject failure of American liberalism to meaningfully respond to this moment.\n\nHere’s my point: if this is fascism, it’s past time to act like it.\n\nLiberalism (centrism in particular) is profoundly vulnerable to fascism, which exploits the notion that all parties should be heard and perspectives debated. Fascists do not concern themselves with truth, reality, contradiction or hypocrisy. They feed off liberalism’s conception of debate and bipartisanship by introducing a reactionary fantasy.\n\nIt gets worse. American liberalism heavily favors centrism, which, in its empty and valueless nature, may constitute a fatal flaw. This flaw is illustrated by the many thought leaders who have gone far beyond just taking seriously fascist ideas all the way to using their platform to advance their perspective and, in some cases, straightforwardly parrot their talking points in a futile attempt to locate a position that appeals to an imaginary “average American.”\n\nIf you are a liberal who cringed at my characterization of liberal institutions, I implore you to consider the following examples I’ve picked out of the bottomless pile.\n\nThe most obvious examples of this strange dissonance surround immigration. Kamala Harris, for instance, called Trump a “fascist” on the campaign trail while running on a “strong border” and calling his border wall, the core of his fascistic political project during his first campaign, a “good idea.”\n\nThe first bill passed during Trump’s second term was the Laken Riley Act, which stripped the undocumented of their right to habeas corpus, which is not only a fundamental human right, but arguably the very foundation of all liberal legal systems. Fifty-eight Democratic legislators (46 in the House, 12 in the Senate) voted for the bill.\n\nDuring the recent protests against largely illegal and entirely morally reprehensible ICE detentions, 75 Democratic lawmakers joined Republicans to “express gratitude” for ICE (a two-decade-old department that is essentially acting as Trump’s Gestapo) and call for greater local and state collaboration.\n\nEven supposedly progressive members of the party try to walk a centrist line by calling for a “bipartisan effort” to “strengthen the border.” All of this is based in pure delusion. There is no “migrant crime wave,” the country is not being “invaded,” President Biden did not “open the borders” (he was almost uniquely restrictive on immigration arguably to the point of violating the internationally recognized right to asylum. That’s another example), and the only “crisis at the border” is humanitarian.\n\nYet to say anything except “we need to strengthen the border” is treated in the majority of American liberal institutions as “naive” because it does not go far enough in capitulating to the utterly hallucinatory politics of a movement we all recognize as fascist.\n\nSo I have a question. Do you believe Trump is a fascist? If you do but you find yourself walking the “middle ground” on his core issues like immigration, LGBTQ rights and policing, it is past time to grow up and ask yourself some hard questions. How do you feel about those who wished to “compromise” with the Nazis’ ideas or condemned forms of resistance they found distasteful? Disgusted, I hope. So, I ask again, do you believe Trump is a fascist?\n\nI have no time or space to attempt to dissuade liberals of centrist positions they may hold on Trump’s core issues. All I have to say is this: your apprehensions about immigrants, trans people, resistance or whatever else do not matter right now. In this moment, capitulation may well mean fascist dictatorship.\n\nFor our vulnerable populations, it may mean annihilation. Right now, defending them is all that matters. Stop doing Trump’s work for him.","summary":"Further capitulation to the administration is not an option.","url":"https://www.centralmaine.com/2025/06/23/threat-of-trump-should-drive-liberals-from-the-middle-ground-opinion/","image":"https://w2pcms.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/06/APTOPIX_Trump_Military_Parade_76764_52308d.jpg?w=1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-23 23:00:18","author":"Roy Tucker","authors":["Roy Tucker"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.101},{"id":334512328,"title":"How is MAGA’s leader weathering the post-Iran-nuclear-strike MAGA storm?","text":"Analysis by WorldTribune Staff, June 23, 2025 Real World News\n\nWho or what is driving President Donald Trump’s decision on Iran?

[See post below].\n\nThere are indications from his words, tariff policies and other actions that Trump sees militant Islam and the Chinese Communist Party as the two major threats to the U.S. and world peace. But his approach in both his administrations to rogue adversaries would appear to follows the Christian prescription: “Love your enemy” (Matthew 5:43–44).\n\nWhether dealing with North Korea’s Kim Jong-Un, the Chinese Communist Party’s Xi Jinping or representatives of Iran’s “Supreme Leader,” Trump offers public praise and assurances of support but talks tough behind closed doors.\n\nThe president almost always leads with win-win scenarios.\n\nRelated: Trump addresses the nation following bombing of Iranian nuclear sites, June 21, 2025\n\nSo far Trump has, for the most part, weathered the storm of anti-war MAGA voices in the wake of the U.S. bombing of three key Iranian nuclear sites.\n\nThat could change, however, if a further escalation occurs, particularly if it involves U.S. boots on the ground in a war with Iran.\n\n“After urging the president to stay out of the burgeoning war between Israel and Iran, some of Mr. Trump’s most vocal anti-war backers viewed his order to drop 14 ‘bunker buster’ bombs and hundreds of missiles on Saturday night as a one-and-done move that will bring peace to the region by disabling Iran’s nuclear capabilities,” Susan Ferrechio wrote for The Washington Times on June 22.\n\n“This is a surgical strike, operated perfectly,” said Turning Point Action CEO Charlie Kirk, a leader of the MAGA youth faction who has voiced opposition to U.S. military involvement in the Middle East. “President Trump acted with prudence and decisiveness.”\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a vocal opponent of bombing Iran prior to Saturday, stated in a post to X: “I can … support President Trump and his great administration on many of the great things they are doing while disagreeing on bombing Iran and getting involved in a hot war that Israel started.”\n\nTrump’s post to Truth Social will further test his standing with the anti-war MAGA crowd:\n\n“It’s not politically correct to use the term, ‘Regime Change,’ but if the current Iranian Regime is unable to MAKE IRAN GREAT AGAIN, why wouldn’t there be a Regime change???” Trump wrote. “MIGA!!!”\n\nThe MAGA anti-war faction hope Trump will stick to his promise to keep U.S. troops out of “endless wars.”\n\n“God Bless President Trump. He is showing his wisdom,” Matt Gaetz, a television host and former congressman who is among the loudest anti-war voices in Trump’s base, said after the president on Thursday gave Iran yet another chance to come to a nuclear deal without any bombs dropping.\n\nFerrechio noted: “Two days after Gaetz praised the president’s restraint, Trump ordered the U.S. military to bomb three of Iran’s underground nuclear facilities in a surprise attack.”\n\nGaetz posted to X after the U.S. attack on Iran: “Just remember: every regime change war has been extremely popular at the start. But the historical trajectory isn’t good.”\n\nAlex Jones, who has 4.4 million followers on social media, said Trump’s order to bomb Iran may have launched World War III.\n\nHe made the statement after Russian Security Council Chairman Dmitry Medvedev said on X that “a number of countries” are prepared to supply Iran with nuclear warheads.\n\n“This is escalating so incredibly fast,” Jones said. “Trump is being maneuvered into this.”\n\nI served on the National Security Council under President Clinton. I was Joe Biden’s Deputy Staff Director of the Senate foreign Relations Committee. I voted for Kamala Harris and have been a vocal critic of many dangerous and undemocratic actions taken by President Trump.\n\n— Jamie Metzl (@JamieMetzl) June 22, 2025\n\n How is MAGA’s leader weathering the post-Iran-nuclear-strike MAGA storm?, WorldTribune.com\n\nHow is MAGA’s leader weathering the post-Iran-nuclear-strike MAGA storm? added by Editor Two on June 23, 2025\n\nView all posts by Editor Two →","summary":"Analysis by WorldTribune Staff, June 23, 2025 Real World News Who or what is driving President Donald Trump’s decision on Iran?

Emhoff, who received his law degree from USC in 1990, will start the job at the USC Gould School of Law on July 1. He taught at Georgetown University’s law school while his wife served as then-President Biden’s vice president and when she was the 2024 Democratic nominee for president. “One of the best parts of my time as Second Gentleman was spending time with these students and young people all around the country — so I look forward to continuing to share my experiences with the next generation and hearing from them in the vibrant academic community at USC,” Emhoff said in a statement. The announcement comes as Harris weighs running for California governor next year, a decision she is not expected to make until the end of the summer. On Monday, she made a surprise virtual appearance at a summit of Free & Just, an organization focused on highlighting the stories of people impacted by the reduction of access to abortion and other reproductive healthcare services. Emhoff said mentoring law students is particularly critical at this time in the nation’s history. “In this difficult moment for the legal community, I believe it is more important than ever to instill in the next generation of lawyers the same principles that drove me to the legal profession: the imperative of speaking out on behalf of the vulnerable, standing up for the rule of law, defending every citizen’s fundamental rights, and always fighting for justice, without fear or favor,” Emhoff said. Emhoff, who lives in Brentwood with Harris, will remain a partner at the global law firm of Willkie Farr & Gallagher, which in April was among the firms that struck a deal with President Trump’s administration agreeing to conform with the president’s policies. The firm agreed to provide at least $100 million in pro bono legal work during Trump’s time in the White House and beyond, which the president said at the time will be dedicated to helping veterans, Gold Star families, law enforcement members and first responders. Emhoff’s continued employment at the firm in the aftermath of the agreement raised eyebrows in progressive circles. He said Monday that he continues to disagree with his firm’s decision to settle with the White House, but remains at the firm because of his faith in his colleagues’ principles, which he said were demonstrated by pro bono work the firm’s attorneys from across the country did during the federal immigration raids by ICE agents and border patrol officers in Los Angeles “I remain confident in the firm’s values, its phenomenal people, and meaningful work we’re doing for our clients and the communities we serve, which have not changed since the settlement—and that’s why I remain at the firm,” Emhoff said. Days after the firm struck the deal, Emhoff said he disagreed with the decision. “At this critical moment, this very critical moment, I urge my colleagues across the legal profession to remain vigilant, engaged, and unafraid to challenge actions that may erode our fundamental rights,” Emhoff said on April 3 at a gala dinner for Bet Tzedek, a Los Angeles-based legal aid organization where he has long volunteered. “Cause we know, the work of justice is never easy, but it is always necessary.”","summary":"As former Vice President Kamala Harris weighs running for governor, her husband, attorney Doug Emhoff, will teach law at USC.","url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2025-06-23/former-vice-president-kamala-harris-husband-joins-usc-law-school-faculty","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2f188a0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2422x1272+0+172/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F9e%2F6c%2Feb2234ff454689166e54fea1b27f%2Femhoff-covid-95012.j","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-23 22:04:53","author":"Seema Mehta","authors":["Seema Mehta"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.522},{"id":334476948,"title":"'No Kings': A turning point for the resistance?","text":"SUBSCRIBE & SAVE\n\nLess than $3 per week\n\nView Profile\n\nThe Explainer\n\nTalking Points\n\nThe Week Recommends\n\nNewsletters\n\nFrom the Magazine\n\nThe Week Junior\n\nFood & Drink\n\nPersonal Finance\n\nAll Categories \n\nNewsletter sign up\n\n'No Kings': A turning point for the resistance?\n\nMillions of Americans nationwide took to the streets to protest against the Trump administration \n\nNewsletter sign up\n\nThe \"No Kings\" movement \"may have been the biggest day of demonstrations in American history\"\n\n(Image credit: Getty Images)\n\nThe Week US \n\n23 June 2025\n\nThe anti-Trump resistance finally \"has reawakened,\" said Michelle Goldberg in The New York Times. Millions of disgusted Americans poured into the streets across 2,100 cities and towns under the \"No Kings\" banner to protest President Donald Trump's authoritarian administration. Even reliably conservative locales like Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, and the Villages retirement community in Florida saw thousands of demonstrators. With Trump sending in soldiers and Marines to occupy Los Angeles and staging a military parade in Washington, D.C., to honor himself, the weary resignation that followed his re-election is giving way to outrage. \"No Kings\" feels like \"a potential turning point.\" In fact, it \"may have been the biggest day of demonstrations in American history,\" said Will Neal in The Daily Beast. Data journalist G. Elliott Morris estimates 4 to 6 million people came out to show their opposition to Trump's toxic, \"far-right\" policies. Overall, the number of protests and rallies against the Trump administration—15,000 in total—has increased threefold since this same period in 2017. A \"mounting backlash\" against Trump is gathering momentum.\n\nDemocrats may be angry, said Jonathan Turley in The Hill, but their absurd \"democracy is dying\" message has grown stale. It's the same platform that they ran on last November—and lost. In reality, Congress continues to perform its constitutional duties, and \"courts have both ruled in favor of and against the Trump administration.\" Democrats, meanwhile, have no message other than Trump hatred, which is why the party continues to poll terribly. The \"No Kings\" mantra is the Democrats' desperate attempt to implant their frustrated rage in the \"public psyche.\"\n\"The backlash to Trump is real,\" said Steve Benen in MSNBC.com, and special election results prove it. Several days before \"No Kings\" day, Democrat Amanda Clinton won an Oklahoma House seat \"in a 69-point landslide.\" The seat was in a Democratic district that Kamala Harris carried by 19 points, and the 50-point swing surpassed all expectations. Overall, Democrats have over-performed in 29 special elections this year, running 16.4 points ahead of the 2024 election results. Republicans are alarmed, which is why White House communications director Steven Cheung called the massive \"No Kings\" protests \"a complete and utter failure with minuscule attendance.\" When the Trump administration tells \"Americans not to believe their own eyes,\" you know that \"the prevailing political winds\" are changing.\n\nSubscribe to The Week\n\nEscape your echo chamber.

Such a shame,” Diller wrote.\n\nSources close to Bloomberg, a news tech titan and New York City’s former mayor, said he also is wary of giving to the DNC again, while others have expressed skepticism that hedge-fund manager Marc Lasry is in a hurry to make up the funding.\n\nDuring the 2023-24 election cycle, Bloomberg gave $413,000 to the DNC; Diller donated $330,400; and Lasry contributed $133,400. \n\nLasry hinted that ultimately he will give again to the DNC — but didn’t specify when. A rep for Bloomberg declined to comment.\n\n“There is just a broad consensus that the DNC is ineffectual and not where we should be giving money,” said a longtime former donor.\n\n“But it’s not surprising,” the source said. “‘I don’t belong to an organized party, I’m a Democrat’ is a longtime joke for a reason.\n\n“We’re so decentralized,” the source added. “The DNC has always been a joke. If you are a megadonor looking to shape the direction of the party, don’t give to the DNC. At this point, the shape of the DNC is just embarrassing.”\n\nThe drop-off in fundraising has left some party bosses questioning whether the committee will have to take out loans, though DNC Chairman Ken Martin has expressed doubt that will happen.\n\nA DNC rep said that many long-time donors have already contributed to the DNC this year as part of a record-breaking donation drive in the first four months under Martin.\n\n But another donor who told The Post his wallet is now closed to the committee said Martin may have his head in the sand.\n\n“People are too embarrassed to admit this,” the source said. “I’m a lifelong Dem who raised a ton of money, and I won’t give them a nickel — and I’m not alone.\n\n“I’m not even a Democrat anymore. The Dems should kidnap Elizabeth Warren and take her to Mexico,” the source said of the lefty Massachusetts senator. “This is how Trump got [his win] — not because Trump is loved but because his ideas are popular.”\n\nOther sources pointed out that recent Democratic fundraising has been largely channeled into New York City’s mayoral race, with party leaders increasingly concerned about the prospect of self-described socialist Zohran Mamdani overtaking ex-Gov. Andrew Cuomo in the primary contest.\n\nThe DNC’s most recent financial filings, released last week, revealed that it bled nearly $3 million alone from its already dwindling reserves during the month of May, with the committee’s pot of gold now standing at a precarious $15 million.\n\nShould Mamdani win, that could further erode support for the DNC from big donors who are concerned their money will simply go to socialists, sources noted.\n\nFor its part, the DNC has denied that donor support is wavering. In a statement released Friday, it touted what it called “record fundraising” and the “highest in DNC history under any chair’s first four months” for Martin.\n\nThe DNC told Axios that the nearly $40 million it garnered between February and May of 2025 “surpasses the $37 million raised under Jaime Harrison’s leadership in those same months in 2021.”\n\n“In the early and mid 2010’s, some big-money donors already tried not funding the DNC and state parties, instead funding groups outside of the Party, which hollowed out the critical work that the Party does while putting us behind the eight-ball when it came to critical coordination during the 2016 presidential election,” warned one Democratic strategist.\n\n“We all know how that story ended — Donald Trump won the Presidency and the Democratic Party fell to an all-time low at every level of government. The Democratic Party needs a fully-funded Party to fight Donald Trump.”\n\nThe Republican National Committee, on the other hand, had a net-positive cash flow for May. It added more than $5 million to its treasure trove, bringing its total funds to more than $72 million.\n\nThese new numbers put the RNC’s cash stash at almost five times the size of the DNC’s. And it’s welcome news for Republicans.\n\nHome Depot founder Ken Langone, a longtime GOP donor, was thrilled by the accounting and said to friends, “We don’t have to worry as the GOP party because the Dem positions are so stupid they’ll never raise money again,” sources said.","summary":"“There is just a broad consensus that the DNC is ineffectual and not where we should be giving money,\" a longtime donor said.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/06/23/us-news/billionaire-dem-donors-slam-ineffectual-dnc-say-they-wont-fork-over-more-cash-for-now/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/107003359.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/c92YefGc-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-06-23 21:07:42","author":"Josh Christenson,Kendall White,Lydia Moynihan","authors":["Josh Christenson","Kendall White","Lydia Moynihan"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.365},{"id":334475564,"title":"Why the 'Byrd Bath' Gives the Senate Parliamentarian So Much Power over What's in the Big Beautiful Bill","text":"Enable Accessibility\nSkip to Content\n\nEntertainment\n\nLondon / Europe\nBorder / Cartel Chronicles\nIsrael / Middle East\n\nLatin America\n\nOn the Hill\n\nOn the Hill Articles\nOn The Hill Exclusive Video\n\nB Inspired \n\nEntertainment\n\nLondon / Europe\nBorder / Cartel Chronicles\nIsrael / Middle East\n\nLatin America\n\nOn the Hill\n\nOn the Hill Articles\nOn The Hill Exclusive Video\n\nBreitbart News Daily\n\nNewsletters \n\n BREITBART\n\nUSA Bombs Iran \n\nBig Beautiful Bill\nTariff Talks\nHollywood Hate\nUkraine Peace Push\n\nWhy the ‘Byrd Bath’ Gives the Senate Parliamentarian So Much Power over What’s in the Big Beautiful Bill\n\n Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images\n\nSean Moran23 Jun 2025 \n\n'Big Beautiful Bill'\nRobert Byrd\n\nSenate Parliamentarian \n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\nVIDEO: 60 'Critically Missing' FL Kids Rescued During Operation Dragon Eye\nWatch: Gavin Newsom's Wife Suggests ICE Agents Are Hunting Illegals\nHollywood Celebrities Spend Weekend Attacking Trump over Iran Bombing\nReport: Israel Sends Message to Iran That War Is Nearing End\nTrump: U.S. Completed 'Successful Attack' on Iranian Nuclear Sites\nOcasio-Cortez Calls for Trump to be Impeached over U.S Strikes on Iran\nCotton: Americans 'Right to Be Concerned' About Iranian Sleeper Cells\nRosie O’Donnell Promotes ‘Recount’ of Trump’s Victory Over Kamala Harris\nU.S. Says Strikes ‘Devastated’ Iran’s Nuclear Program\nReport: Iran Fires at U.S. Bases in Qatar, Iraq; Missiles Intercepted\n\nFROM THE HOMEPAGE\n\nTrump Announces Ceasefire in Iran-Israel ’12 Day War’\nDonald Trump: Iran Has ‘Gotten It All out of Their System’; ‘IT’S TIME FOR PEACE’\n1,500 Iranian Nationals Apprehended by Border Patrol During Biden Administration\nTrump Campaign Team Launches PAC to Primary Rep.

He also claims that its “false advertising and tampering” withheld viewers’ attention from him and his social media platform Truth Social, resulting in a decrease in value for Trump Media and Technology Group and his other media holdings while also violating the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act.\n\nThough Trump’s team has argued that the interview and its promotion on “Face the Nation” are commercial speech, CBS fired back that they provided the court with “nothing that would support the conclusion that the ‘Face the Nation’ and ’60 Minutes’ Broadcasts — involving an interview of a presidential candidate about issues of utmost public concern — are anything but fully protected editorial speech, and they cite not a single case holding that news broadcasts (or promotions for such broadcasts) are commercial speech.”\n\n“Indeed, the Supreme Court has repeatedly rejected that argument,” the network added. “The First Amendment applies fully to the news reporting at issue and bars Plaintiffs’ claims.”\n\nCBS also stated that Trump lacks standing because he cannot rely on “intangible harms” that are “common to the public at large” and that accepting it would “amount to greenlighting thousands of consumer claims brought by individuals who merely disagree with a news organizations’ editorial choices.”\n\n“President Trump has not plausibly alleged that he personally suffered ‘an injury to a commercial interest in reputation or sales,’” they added.\n\nIn a second filing, also obtained by TheWrap, CBS argued that a case about an interview that was filmed in Washington, D.C., and broadcast from New York City does not belong in Texas federal court.\n\n“Plaintiffs do not dispute that the filming, editing and production work for the challenged Interview took place nearly 2,000 miles from this courthouse. They do not dispute that the Interview never referenced this state. And they do not dispute that the people most knowledgeable about the Interview all worked in New York or Washington, D.C.,” the network’s attorneys wrote. “President Trump and Representative Jackson do not even allege that they watched the ‘FTN’ or ’60 Minutes’ Broadcasts from Texas when they aired. In short, there is no basis for jurisdiction or venue in this Court.”\n\nThey further urged that the case be dismissed or transferred to the Southern District of New York. The judge currently overseeing the case is Matthew J. Kacsmaryk, a Trump appointee who has previously sided with right-leaning groups on cases related to abortion and LGBTQ rights.\n\nThe high stakes legal battle comes as Paramount’s pending $8 billion merger with Skydance Media awaits regulatory approval from the FCC due to a required transfer of broadcast licenses of the media giant’s 28 owned-and-operated local TV stations. The deal, which executives have said would close in the first half of 2025, recently triggered its first automatic 90-day extension after failing to close by April 7.\n\nIf the merger is not closed by the time that extension expires next month, it would automatically be pushed another 90 days into October. After that, if the deal is still not closed, the FCC blocks the merger or one of the parties involved breaches the terms of the agreement, then Skydance and Paramount will have the option of terminating the deal.\n\nWhen asked by reporters last week whether he sees the agency’s review being resolved soon, Trump replied: “I hope so. Ellison’s great, he’ll do a great job with it.” But he also took the opportunity to blast CBS for the Harris interview.\n\n“What they did was they interviewed Kamala, her answer was horrendous, I would say election-threatening,” he said. “They took the entire answer out, and they took another answer from another question and put it in. And they did that, I understand, a number of times … We caught ’em, and they are very embarrassed by it, and they are working on a settlement now.”\n\nDemocratic Sens. Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Ron Wyden issued a warning to Paramount’s controlling shareholder Shari Redstone last month that reaching a settlement in exchange for regulatory approval could violate federal anti-bribery laws. The California State Senate has also launched an investigation into the matter and invited former “60 Minutes” executive producer Bill Owens and former CBS News president Wendy McMahon to testify.\n\nFCC chairman Brendan Carr has argued that the settlement talks with Trump are unrelated to the agency’s review of the Skydance deal. But he has warned that “all options remain on the table” in the agency’s ongoing investigation into alleged “news distortion” related to the Harris interview, including potentially revoking CBS’ broadcast license if the network is found to have violated the agency’s public interest standard. \n\nParamount’s settlement talks come as Disney previously paid $15 million to settle a defamation lawsuit Donald Trump brought against ABC News and star anchor George Stephanopoulos. Meta also paid $25 million to settle Trump’s lawsuit about being kicked off Facebook and Instagram after the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.","summary":"In a new court filing, the network argues that its \"60 Minutes\" Kamala Harris interview is \"fully protected editorial speech\" \n\n\nThe post CBS Blasts Trump&#8217;s $20 Billion Lawsuit as &#8216;Meritless&#8217; Attempt to &#8216;Evade Bedrock First Amendment Principles&#8217; appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/cbs-blasts-meritless-trump-lawsuit-court-filing/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Donald-Trump-Shari-Redstone.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-23 19:39:08","author":"Lucas Manfredi","authors":["Lucas Manfredi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.351},{"id":334452256,"title":"Provisions of ‘Big, Beautiful Bill’ Get Scrubbing in Senate in Parliamentarian’s ‘Byrd’ Bath","text":"A number of provisions of the House’s Big Beautiful Bill Act—the main legislative vehicle for fulfilling President Donald Trump’s campaign promises—have been thrown out in recent days, complicating Republicans’ efforts to pass the 10-year fiscal framework before Independence Day on July 4.\n\nSenate Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough—essentially the Senate referee—decides on whether or not provisions in the budget reconciliation process follow Senate rules.\n\nIn such cases, she is invoking the “Byrd rule,” which is meant to restrict the process to budgetary policy only. The rule is named for then-Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., who was the rule’s main sponsor when it was adopted in 1985.\n\nThere are a few reasons a parliamentarian might to toss a provision under the Byrd rule: if it does not produce a change in spending or savings that is more than “merely incidental”; if it is not in compliance with budgetary instructions; if it increases deficits beyond the 10-year window; if it is outside a committee’s jurisdiction; or if it affects Social Security.\n\nIn order to overcome such overruling, Republicans would have to get 60 votes to overturn each ruling, per Senate custom. That’s very unlikely given the current partisan divide in the Senate, where Republicans hold 53 of the 100 seats.\n\nHere‘s how the bill has been changed in recent days.\n\nFood Stamps\n\nMacDonough has thrown out some of the reforms to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which provides food stamps to millions of Americans.\n\nSpecifically, the parliamentarian has struck provisions that would have barred noncitizens from accessing food stamps and would have forced states to share a larger amount of the cost of the program if they have a higher payment error rate. \n\nThose amount to a gutting of the House and Senate agriculture committees’ work on the bill and will do damage to the overall spending reductions of the bill. \n\nState Border Enforcement\n\nAnother provision on the chopping block was “state and local assistance”—authorizing states to assist the federal government in carrying out immigration enforcement.\n\n“This subsection authorizes states to conduct border security and immigration enforcement, which are federal functions,” write Senate Budget Committee Democrats in their outline of the Byrd rule casualties. \n\nBeyond precluding the federal government from saving money on these operations, the parliamentarian’s ruling also deals a blow to the bill’s work to help fulfill Trump’s promises on border security. \n\nSelling Off Postal Service EVs\n\nSlashed from the bill is a provision that “mandates the sale of all the United States Postal Service’s electric vehicles and infrastructure to support its electric vehicles.”\n\nWhile perhaps not a massive setback for congressional Republicans, it means that this element of former President Joe Biden’s presidency will live on.\n\nIs a Parliamentarian’s Ruling Final?\n\nThe Senate parliamentarian’s rulings are something of a setback to Republicans, but they are not necessarily final. A simple option is to amend and resubmit the provision so that the parliamentarian no longer considers it in violation.\n\nThe Senate can also motion to waive the parliamentarian’s ruling, which requires 60 votes—an unlikely outcome given Republicans’ 53-seat majority and Democrats’ unanimous opposition to the bill.\n\nThere is also the option of having the presiding officer of the Senate—Vice President JD Vance—choose to ignore the parliamentarian’s rulings. This would send an earthquake through Washington and shatter precedent.\n\nFor context, back in 2021, Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., urged Vice President Kamala Harris to overrule MacDonough’s striking a $15 minimum wage provision in the American Rescue Act, a reconciliation package.\n\n“I’m sorry—an unelected parliamentarian does not get to deprive 32 million Americans the raise they deserve,” Khanna said in 2021. “This is an advisory, not a ruling. VP Harris needs to disregard and rule a $15 minimum wage in order.” Harris ultimately did not pursue this.\n\nThere is also the option of removing a parliamentarian, which then-Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., did with then-Parliamentarian Robert Dove in 2001.\n\nThese latter two options are extremely unlikely, but they are in the Republicans’ toolbox if they consider MacDonough’s rulings do considerable damage to the main legislative vehicle for enacting Trump’s agenda.","summary":"A number of provisions of the House’s Big Beautiful Bill Act—the main legislative vehicle for fulfilling President Donald Trump’s campaign promises—have been thrown out in...

It was among the closest races and went to a recount. Bohannan announced last week she is taking on Miller-Meeks for a third time in hopes of flipping the seat in the 2026 midterms.The election will likely become one of the most competitive races as Democrats aim to regain control of the House, particularly if Trump's falling approval rating fuels a 2018-style \"blue wave.\"What To KnowPolitico reported a new poll of the district showing Bohannan with an early lead over the incumbent Republican. The internal poll was conducted by Public Policy Polling and commissioned by the House Majority PAC.Bohannan received 43 percent support to 39 percent for Miller-Meeks, while 18 percent were undecided.Bohannan told Newsweek that the poll is a \"reflection of what we are seeing in the district.\"\"Hundreds of people reached out to me asking me to run again.

It's illustrative of the sort of rural district Democrats once did well in but have struggled in recent elections.Democrats view Bohannan as a strong recruit, pointing to her strong showing in the district compared to former Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024.

Fox News Digital reached out to Harris' office regarding Metzl's post, but did not immediately receive a reply.

I’m praying for the safety of our service members in the region,\" New Jersey Democratic Rep.

John Fetterman wrote on X on Saturday. \"Iran is the world’s leading sponsor of terrorism and cannot have nuclear capabilities. I’m grateful for and salute the finest military in the world.\" While New York Times columnist Bret Stephens, a frequent Trump critic, wrote in an opinion piece that Trump made a \"courageous and correct decision that deserves respect, no matter how one feels about this president,\" while fellow Times columnist David French also said it was the \"right decision\" on social media. Other Democrats and frequent Trump critics, such as New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Republican Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie, have slammed Trump over the strikes, arguing they bypassed Congress. FETTERMAN BACKS TRUMP AFTER IRAN STRIKES: 'THE CORRECT MOVE' Trump announced the Saturday evening strikes on Iran in a Truth Social post that was not preceded by media leaks or speculation that strikes were imminent. The unexpected social media post was followed just hours later by a brief Trump address to the nation while flanked by Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Vice President JD Vance. \"A short time ago, the U.S. military carried out massive precision strikes on the three key nuclear facilities in the Iranian regime: Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan,\" Trump said from the White House late on Saturday in an address to the nation regarding the strikes. \"Everybody heard those names for years as they built this horribly destructive enterprise. Our objective was the destruction of Iran's nuclear enrichment capacity, and a stop to the nuclear threat posed by the world's No. 1 state sponsor of terror. Tonight, I can report to the world that the strikes were a spectacular military success.\" The strikes \"obliterated\" Iranian nuclear facilities and backed the nation into a corner to make a peace deal, Trump said. This mission was also celebrated by Hegseth and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine as one that was cloaked in secrecy and intentionally deceptive to confuse the enemy. \"It involved misdirection and the highest of operational security. Our B-2s went in and out of… these nuclear sites, in and out and back, without the world knowing at all,\" Hegseth said. \"In that way, it was historic.\" The operation included the longest B-2 spirit bomber mission since 2001, the second-longest B-2 mission ever flown and the largest B-2 operational strike in U.S. history, Hegseth and Caine said during the Sunday press conference. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Operation Midnight Hammer followed Israel launching preemptive strikes on Iran on June 12 after months of attempted and stalled nuclear negotiations and subsequent heightened concern that Iran was advancing its nuclear program.

But with 31 months to go before the Iowa caucuses, there is ample time for events to reshape this perception. Inherent disadvantages for vice presidents seeking their party’s nomination after a two-term presidency, shifting party fault lines, and unpredictable political storms on the horizon all complicate his path to the 2028 GOP nomination.\n\nDespite real strengths that cement his early position, crowning Vance as the heir to MAGA this far out is premature. \n\nVance’s strengths\n\nFrom 30,000 feet, the fundamentals look good for a Vance 2028 nomination bid as of today. \n\nHistory shows that a winning GOP primary campaign should hope to garner at least 45% of the primary electorate. That number, earned by President Donald Trump in 2016, marks the lowest total won during a contested primary of the past 50 years.\n\nAccording to an Economist-YouGov survey conducted between May 9 and 12, Vance is viewed favorably by 77% of Republicans, with 51% viewing Vance “very favorably.”\n\nCrucially, Vance is viewed as a Trump loyalist, and in turn, the MAGA base, which is now the GOP base, appears loyal to him. Vance has embraced Trump’s worldview and style, and thus far, their political partnership has been harmonious, with little daylight appearing between the two in public. \n\nThe only possible moment of incongruity came when the infamous Signal chat emerged, in which Vance had criticized the strikes in Yemen, saying, “I think we are making a mistake,” and, “I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now.” White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller was seen as putting the vice president in his place, writing, “As I heard it, the president was clear.”\n\nBut for the MAGA base, including its most prominent influencers, the incident only deepened their affection for Vance, who they view as a bulwark against neoconservative influence within the administration. \n\nVance’s support among MAGA influencers is unwavering. Tucker Carlson, speaking at a Heritage Foundation event, described Vance as “the future. Period. … JD Vance is the best I’ve ever met. He’s the combination of intelligence, decency, wisdom, emotional self-control.” Influential MAGA darling Laura Loomer recently predicted a Vance-Trump Jr. ticket for 2028. And influencer Jack Posobiec of Pizzagate fame frequently refers to Vance as “48” and sells T-shirts with Vance’s face on them. (Vance appears to return the affection, having blurbed Posobiec’s latest book.)\n\nThe large, engaged audiences of these New Right media figures make their endorsements critical in GOP primaries.\n\nVance is also a media machine unto himself. Since stepping onto the national stage last year, no Republican figure, including Trump, has delivered more powerful media moments of the “own the libs” variety than Vance. His rebuke of CBS News’s Margaret Brennan, which included the now-famous quip, “I don’t really care, Margaret,” in response to her criticism of the Trump administration’s pause of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, went super viral on X and drew over 1.7 million views on YouTube within 24 hours. \n\nVance’s exceptional “memeability,” underscored by the endless images shared daily of edited versions of Vance’s face superimposed on other bodies, is a powerful attribute in the social media age. Like his boss, Vance has proven able to harness the internet’s chaotic energy, riding the wave of the zeitgeist to cement his place as a cultural and political lightning rod.\n\nMeanwhile, his often blunt and polarizing sound bites are the perfect online fodder for the highly engaged Republican voters. His bond with the famously tempestuous MAGA faithful seems only to deepen with time, an accomplishment of which only a few beyond the Trump family can boast. \n\nVance’s ability to dominate debates is another strength in a primary process heavily influenced by debate performances. Though his debate resume is limited — the only two of his short political career are his 2022 Senate debate with former Ohio Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan and his 2024 vice presidential debate against Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN) — his commanding performances in both suggest a mastery of the format. His showing against Walz impressed so much that commentators speculated at the time that the field for 2028 might already be cleared. \n\nCauses for concern\n\nFor all of these formidable strengths, a Vance bid for the GOP nomination faces significant obstacles. \n\nVice presidents generally have had a difficult time securing their party’s nomination. Not counting former Vice President Kamala Harris, who was given the nomination without a vote, and former President Joe Biden, whose run came four years after leaving office, only three sitting vice presidents have become their party’s subsequent standard-bearer in the past 50 years: Walter Mondale, George H.W. Bush, and Al Gore — a group that only produced one general election winner. \n\nThe reasons vice presidents struggle here are manifold. For one, they are saddled with the record and popular approval of the outgoing president, and in the modern era, administrations tend to end with a whimper, not a bang. One exception is former President Bill Clinton, who, aided by an overzealous impeachment effort by Republicans and a resilient economy, saw his popularity rise in the waning days of his presidency. This aided Gore’s effort to fend off a strong primary challenge from Bill Bradley. The electorate, including primary voters, is often hungry for change after two full terms of a presidency. George H.W. Bush’s successful bid following his stint as Ronald Reagan’s vice president is the exception, not the rule.\n\nWhether Trump’s second term will end on a soaring note or a nadir will largely be determined by the state of the economy. The tumultuous nature of Trump’s tariff war makes it difficult to forecast. Vance’s fortunes will be tied to the trade war’s outcomes, and perhaps explicitly with whispers that Trump is considering Vance to become the administration’s “tariff czar.” Such an appointment would carry the ultimate boom or bust potential for a 2028 run at the White House.\n\nNumerous other unknowns color the coming primary battle. While Vance appears to have the support of the extremely loyal MAGA base, there is plenty of time for Trump and Vance’s relationship to go south. High-profile relationships with Trump end poorly more often than not, with Elon Musk as the latest example.\n\nVance accusing Trump of ignorance in the Signal chat is an isolated incident insofar as we know. History shows that it doesn’t take much for a Trump insider to become a Trump pariah. \n\nTo be sure, Vance’s standing within the MAGA movement remains entirely in Trump’s hands. It is inconceivable that anyone of whom Trump disapproves could win the 2028 nomination. Friction could emerge between the two on numerous issues. Trump’s sudden reversal on deporting farm and restaurant workers contrasts sharply with the immigration priorities of Vance’s New Right backers, who emphasize the notion that illegal labor drives down wages for American workers in low-skill sectors. \n\nThe president’s spat with Carlson over the definition of “America First” foreign policy in relation to Israel’s war with Iran presents another possible point of conflict between Trump and Vance. Carlson fumed at Israel’s strike and blasted the U.S. as “complicit in the act of war” that contradicts the movement’s isolationist stance. Trump countered by telling the Atlantic that the “America First” movement isn’t a fixed set of ideas but whatever Trump wants it to be. \n\n“Well, considering that I’m the one that developed ‘America First,’ and considering that the term wasn’t used until I came along, I think I’m the one that decides that,” he said. \n\nThe issue of life is another area for possible disagreement. Since being tapped as Trump’s vice president, Vance, once a stalwart anti-abortion senator, has adapted his views on access to mifepristone and a national abortion ban. But a primary that includes anti-abortion challengers would force him to break with the president or defend the administration’s spotty pro-life record. Both options come with their own set of political risks.\n\nSo far, Vance appears to enjoy broad support among the pro-life movement’s leaders despite embracing views that run counter to the cause. Vance’s public vow to maintain access to the abortion pill and his active promotion of in vitro fertilization, both positions that conflict sharply with the Catholic Church and the broader pro-life movement, could open the door for a pro-life primary challenger to siphon off votes.\n\nVance’s relative youth and political inexperience also raise questions about his inevitability. Vance, whose national political career is only a few years old, has only run two races against deeply flawed opponents: Ryan and Harris-Walz. A primary battle against a Republican heavyweight, such as Secretary of State Marco Rubio or Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, would easily be his most difficult political test. It’s unclear how Vance would hold up during the lengthy primary process against robust competition. \n\nVance’s brand of politics is another area of concern. His obvious intellectual capabilities draw rave reviews from the post-liberal intelligentsia. But his severe demeanor, seen in intense exchanges on social media and in interviews with mainstream journalists, may alienate voters beyond his online base.\n\nAn indispensable aspect of Trump’s political effectiveness is his sense of humor and ability to connect with ordinary people. For every rage-filled, all-caps Truth Social post, there’s a genuinely hilarious joke at a MAGA rally or a photo shoot hanging from a McDonald’s window. Vance has not demonstrated the ability to shift gears in this way. It’s one thing to be an impressive intellect and another altogether to be liked. People like Trump. The jury is still out on Vance. \n\nIt’s also unclear what will become of the GOP primary electorate post-Trump. Will MAGA factionalize once its founding father steps off the stage? Will Vance’s high unfavorable ratings — as of today, the RealClearPolitics polling average has Vance’s approval rating at 42% and his disapproval at 45% — enable a primary opponent to argue credibly that he isn’t the party’s best general election nominee?

This is what the western left could learn from him | Owen Jones","text":"The Zohran Mamdani phenomenon should not be happening, if received wisdom is a reliable predictor of events. He’s the 33-year-old Muslim leftist and Queens assemblyman running for the New York mayoralty with the support of the Democratic Socialists of America, and the vitriolic campaign against him suggests his momentum has caused panic in gilded circles. His chief opponent for the Democratic nomination, Andrew Cuomo, could not scream party establishment more loudly: he’s New York state’s former governor – just like his father was – and a former cabinet secretary. He married into that classic Democratic royalty, the Kennedys; his endorsements include the former president Bill Clinton; and billionaires such as Mike Bloomberg are pouring millions into his Super Pac.\n\nIn another age, someone like Mamdani would have been a no-hoper. What changed was the 2016 presidential campaign of the long-marginalised socialist senator Bernie Sanders, which re-energised the US left. But Donald Trump’s recent victory on a more extreme platform led to predictions of a general rightwing lurch in US politics, with progressive positions scapegoated for the Democratic loss (even though Kamala Harris ran on a squarely corporate, “centrist” ticket). I was scheduled to interview Mamdani on the night of the US presidential election, but his campaign asked to postpone as results started to come in suggesting a Trump victory was likely. Presumably, they wanted to reassess strategy in the coming US political winter.\n\nBut just a few months later, Mamdani is surging, and his campaign offers lessons for the western left in an age of chronic economic insecurity, rising far-right authoritarianism, war and genocide. The primary election vote is tomorrow, but a poll released during crucial early voting shows Mamdani overtaking Cuomo in “ranked choice” voting: it’s within the margin of error, but five months ago the insurgent candidate was polling only 1% support. In only a month, Mamdani has leapt from 22% to 32%, particularly powered by a 2:1 lead among the under-50s.\n\nYes, the millennial has been helped by Cuomo’s chronic liabilities – the former governor resigned in disgrace after an investigation by the state attorney general found that he had sexually harrassed several women – but rival candidates with bigger profiles and more political experience could have gained from that instead. The New York Times pleaded with readers not to rank Mamdani in the preferential voting system, rich New Yorkers are threatening to flee the city if he wins, he’s been attacked for inexperience, and smeared over his championing of Palestinian rights. “Zohran Mamdani is a public menace,” screeches rightwing magazine the National Review.\n\nSo what’s the universal lessons for the western left? Three Ms are key: messaging, medium and movement. Grace Mausser is the co-chair of New York City Democratic Socialists of America (DSA). When I suggested that Mamdani’s campaign would surely originally have been driven by revitalising the left, rather than the prospect of an actual election victory, she disagrees.\n\n“When we started, we knew the path to victory was narrow,” she conceded. But, she emphasised: “We don’t run races for purely moral reasons or to make a point like the Green party in the US which has failed in their project.” Indeed, the DSA played a pivotal role in Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s shock defeat of another Democratic luminary, the former chair of the House Democratic Caucus Joe Crowley back in 2018. In turn, Ocasio-Cortez has bolstered Mamdani with her endorsement, underlining how progressive victories feed off one another.\n\n“Super-clear messaging” is how Mausser sums up the Mamdani strategy. The early campaign settled on three main messages: “Fast and free buses, freeze the rents, free childcare. That’s so easy to remember. People know it, and it’s said over and over and over again.” Mamdani has other pledges, too – such as launching publicly run grocery stores – but key to his success are core, endlessly repeated commitments focused on a cost of living crisis triggered by a broken economic system.\n\nThis strategy is essential in combating a “culture war” designed to force leftists into a defensive posture. It doesn’t mean abandoning marginalised minorities – Mamdani has unequivocally committed to transgender rights, for example. It just means emphasising unifying economic messages. Anger is redirected from the disenfranchised to thriving economic elites, whom Mamdani seeks to tax to fulfil his pledges. The campaign has settled, too, on not backing down to bad faith attacks: Mamdani has not given an inch in his pro-Palestinian advocacy.\n\nThen there’s the medium. What Mausser calls “high-quality video production” has been pivotal. Across the west, the far right has proven adept at using platforms such as TikTok to radicalise supporters, with the left mostly not even playing catch-up. Mamdani’s campaign made slick videos that are witty, sassy and snappy, communicating its messages to wide audiences. “All the conversations after the election [were] about needing a ‘Joe Rogan of the left’, how people aren’t getting their news from traditional media, how they’re getting their news from TikTok, Instagram and YouTube,” says Democratic strategist Waleed Shahid. “And that is exactly the story of Zohran.”\n\nWhen Sanders endorsed Mamdani, he declared how he was “very impressed by the grassroots movement that he has put together”. Mamdani’s campaign has an army of door-knockers, often visiting districts traditionally ignored by Democratic machine politicians. For many of these canvassers, this is their first political experience. Mausser reports: “If you ask them, ‘How did you hear about Zohran?’, it’s like: ‘Oh, I saw his video on Instagram or TikTok.’” The message and the medium raised an army. There’s another factor, too: Mamdani, like Ocasio-Cortez, is charismatic and telegenic. It’s not fashionable to discuss this on a left which prioritises the collective over the individual, but we need compelling communicators who look the part.\n\nMamdani may not win the Democratic nomination. Even if he does, Cuomo will stand as an independent candidate, although the socialist challenger may do this, too. His campaign’s weaknesses reflect those of the wider US left: too little inroads among Black and older voters, as well as those with little online political engagement. But Mamdani’s against-the-odds success underlines why the far-right surge doesn’t have to weaken the left – far from it. Indeed, Mamdani positions himself as best-placed to resist Trump, rather than kowtow to his agenda. When the Republicans won, one of Mamdani’s first viral videos was visiting local districts where Trump enjoyed his biggest swings.\n\nWhatever happens, Mamdani shows that the US left lives on after what Shahid calls “a shitty year”: along with Trump’s triumph, there have been dispiriting primary defeats of progressive representatives Jamaal Bowman and Cori Bush at the hands of notorious pro-Israel lobbyists Aipac. Mamdani has built a movement in New York, but his campaign has also given a shellshocked western left a gift: a strategy to take on the establishment even in adverse circumstances.\n\n Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist","summary":"He has used clear messaging to redirect anger from the disenfranchised to the economic elites.

The pair eventually married, becoming partners in life as well as music and setting the stage for what would become the now invincible husband-and-wife duo behind The War and Treaty. They perform this weekend in Tinley Park, opening for singer-songwriter Chris Stapleton.\n\n“[Michael] really sparked something in me when I saw him perform. There was a level of passion that I, as an artist, no longer had,” Tanya Trotter confessed in a recent interview from the couple’s now-adopted home of Nashville. They live there now with four children, some of whom take part in the family business, including a daughter who works as the band’s merch manager and their youngest son whom they describe as their biggest critic. (Tanya also has roots in Chicago including a grandmother who once lived in Oak Park and several cousins that still call the city home.)\n\n“When I saw [Michael’s] passion, I was just overwhelmed by the talent but also the lyrics to the songs that I heard,” Tanya added. “I had to connect with him, not just musically, but as a human being. You really can’t write that deep and not be in touch with your own humanity, you know?”\n\nIt’s a gift Michael found in the most difficult of times, while in combat in Iraq, Remarkably, he taught himself how to play music on Saddam Hussein’s personal piano as his unit was stationed in one of the dictator’s palaces. The first song he ever played on the instrument was “Lean on Me” by Bill Withers.\n\n“I think that those worlds [music and war] meet where there’s tragedy. And I found tranquility and tragedy through music,” Michael said.. With Tanya, it’s one of the themes the pair has explored with incredible conviction on songs such as the harrowing “Five More Minutes,” released in 2020, detailing a time when, at the height of his PTSD battle, Michael thought of ending his life.\n\nTo date, the Trotters have released five albums (the most recent, “Plus One,” appropriately launched this past Valentine’s Day), all tied by a sound representative of the American diaspora, one that’s a little bit country and a whole lot of soul, gospel and folk. It’s a mix heard on the gripping early work “Down to the River” all the way through to their latest harmonizer, “Feels Like Home.”\n\nAnd from nearly the beginning, The War and Treaty has been heralded by all corners of the music industry, leading the couple to lay stake at the hallowed Grand Ole Opry on multiple occasions, while receiving co-signs from artists like Emmylou Harris, Billy Strings, the Rolling Stones and Stapleton. They have become the first Black duo ever nominated for country music’s esteemed ACM and CMA Awards at a time that the genre grapples with inclusivity.\n\nThe Trotters have not been immune to the backlash that fellow Black artists such as Beyoncé have faced, the latter when releasing “Cowboy Carter” in 2024. For the Trotters, that vitriol especially picked up last year when they teamed with Bon Jovi on the song “The People’s House,” endorsing then-presidential candidate Kamala Harris.\n\n“That’s what this is all about though. If we are the land of the free and the home of the brave, then see me. Allow me to freely create what I want to create,” said Michael. “Nobody told Morgan Wallen that he can’t mix R&B with country because he’s white.”\n\nStill, Michael added, “We get those comments … from ignorant people that claim to be country music fans. And they’re just fans of their own disdain. Anybody who is pure and wants to do some good, there’s always going to be a group of haters. But I believe that we’re doing a good job and just being authentically who we are. And that’s just the truth about it.”\n\n“But I think that’s the beautiful thing about being an artist,” added Tanya. “You find your tribe.”\n\nIf the Trotters’ journey sounds like something you might see in the movies, well, it soon will be. A biopic has been in the works for six years now, led by John Legend’s Get Lifted Films and “La La Land” producer Gary Gilbert, with Recording Academy CEO Harvey Mason Jr. acting as music supervisor. Though the couple can’t say too much about it yet, other than the script has been written and the film is currently being cast, there is one message they really hope to impart in the film.\n\n“I think it’s important for people to really see a love story. They don’t really see too many love stories that come from people that look like Michael and I. And it’s an American story. You know, he served our country and he made the ultimate sacrifice,” Tanya said.\n\n“I think it’s important, especially now, for people to not be jaded by the fact that love still conquers all,” she added. “I know a lot of us are living in a state of fear, but love is really the thread that keeps us all together, and just like other times we’ve gotten through it, we’ll get through it again.”","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/music/2025/06/23/the-war-and-treaty-chris-stapleton-opener-black-country-folk-music","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8577279/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2573x1469+0+0/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff4%2Fbb%2Ff0d15403478481556d13b50b5bea%2Fphoto-","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-23 17:31:00","author":"Selena Fragassi | For the Sun-Times","authors":["Selena Fragassi | For the Sun-Times"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.522},{"id":334395200,"title":"Iran performatively launches missiles towards US base in Qatar [NewsFlash]","text":"Skip to content\n\nTry Ads-Free Fark\n\nIt's Not News, It's Fark\n\nHow To FarkLog In | Sign Up »\n\nForgot password?\n\n Turn on javascript (or enable it for Fark) for a better user experience.\n\nIf you can read this, either the style sheet didn't load or you have an older browser that doesn't support\nstyle sheets.

American officials have long been concerned that Iran was working to develop nuclear weapons, that Iranian officials say its program is only focused on energy production.Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard testified in March that Iran was not working on developing a nuclear weapon.The strikes divided Americans, as polls suggest many are skeptical of the U.S. becoming involved in the conflict. Both Democrats and Republicans raised concerns about Trump not seeking congressional authority for the strikes and whether it could endanger American troops and civilians in the region. Others supported the strikes as a means to prevent Iran from having nuclear capabilities.What To KnowSome Trump critics have supported the strikes. This includes both more traditional conservatives who broke with Trump over issues like the January 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol or his approach to other global affairs like the Russia-Ukraine war, as well as Democrats who have cast themselves as close allies to Iran.Former Representative Adam Kinzinger of Illinois is among those anti-Trump Republicans who have supported the move. Kinzinger broke with Trump over the January 6 riot. Kinzinger supported former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election over Trump.In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Kinzinger called the strikes a \"good call by the President.\"\"The US attack on the nuclear facilities is, in my opinion, the right call. We will see what the results are, but now the key is suppressing surface to surface missile fire, and then negotiate to end the fight with Iran,\" he wrote.In another post, he wrote that the military \"should be used to compel diplomatic action,\" and that a \"nuclear armed Iran would have been unacceptable.\"John Bolton, Trump's former national security adviser turned critic, backed the strikes in remarks on CNN.\"I think President Trump made the right decision for America to attack Iran's nuclear weapons program, and I think we're on the verge of potentially seeing regime change in Iran as part of that,\" Bolton said. \"This is a huge change in the Middle East. Decisive action is the right thing to do. I thought somebody should do it for a long time, but better late than never.\"Former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who challenged Trump in the 2024 Republican presidential primary, said Trump deserves an \"enormous amount of credit\" for the strikes during an interview on ABC News.\"This is against type for him. I'm sure it was a difficult decision. I think his analysis was, he cannot live with a nuclear weapon in Iran, and Israel did all of the heavy lifting,\" he said.Ex-GOP Governor Raises 'Great Doubts' About Trump's Iran Strikes to NewsweekSome Republican critics raised concerns about the strikes.Christine Todd Whitman, the former Republican governor of New Jersey who has been sharply critical of the party's shift toward Trump, told Newsweek she has \"great doubts\" about the decision.\"I think we all agree that Iran shouldn't have a nuclear weapon and I have to bow to intelligence reports that purportedly said they were within in a week or two of making that a reality,\" she said. \"I can only hope that the intelligence is correct, but since this president doesn't seem to listen to his intelligence chief I have great doubts and wish he had pursued the disarmament talks further.\"She noted that the strikes \"should not have come as a surprise to Congress,\" and that it could \"galvanize them to finally take back some of the powers they have ceded to the president.\"Some Democrats Back Iran StrikesSome Democratic Trump critics also voiced some support for the move.Representative Jared Moskowitz of Florida wrote in a series of posts on X that the strike appeared to be targeted to \"defend the U.S., Israel, and allies throughout the region and the world.\"\"I've always held that Iran cannot be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon. That has been US policy throughout Democratic and Republican Administrations, and it is my hope that Iran no longer has the capabilities to continue its nuclear program. The world would be a safer place,\" he wrote.Representative Steny Hoyer of Maryland said the strikes were \"essential to preventing Iran from developing a nuclear weapon.\" Still, he said the threat of Iran developing a nuclear weapon became \"dire\" due to the Trump administration's decision to end the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action in 2018.\"Every American president since Jimmy Carter, regardless of party, as well as multiple generations of both Democratic and Republican leadership in Congress, articulated the bipartisan policy that allowing Iran to develop nuclear weapons was unacceptable,\" he wrote.What People Are SayingSenator Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican and Trump critic, on X: \"President Trump's decision to carry out focused strikes on Iran's nuclear infrastructure makes clear that the international community will not tolerate a nuclear-armed Iran. I commend all those who executed this mission with precision and professionalism.\"Representative Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican who has been critical of the strikes, on X: \"This is not America First folks.\"Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat, criticized the strikes on X: \"The President's disastrous decision to bomb Iran without authorization is a grave violation of the Constitution and Congressional War Powers. He has impulsively risked launching a war that may ensnare us for generations. It is absolutely and clearly grounds for impeachment.\"What Happens NextIran has pledged retaliation for the strikes, and cities across the United States are preparing for the potential consequences. The conflict could have significant impacts for millions of people living in the region, as well as economic impacts that could reverberate back to the U.S.","summary":"Trump critics like former GOP Representative Adam Kinzinger have offered the president praise over the Iran strikes.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-critics-defend-iran-strikes-2089403","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2669032/donald-trump-critics-defend-iran-strikes.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-23 16:28:12","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.208},{"id":334580742,"title":"Amanda Seales Trashes Kamala Harris Again, But Here&#8217;s Why Folks are Responding Differently This Time","text":"You know what they say: a broken clock is right twice a day. That's how a lot of folks are feeling about Amanda Seales' latest tirade against former Vice President Kamala Harris on Instagram live.\n\nIn the face of President Donald Trump dropping bombs on three of Iran's nuclear facilities, many Americans believe that if Harris were elected president, none of this would've ever gone down. But Seales has a different opinion: \"I don't even understand how you can make such a statement,\" she said.\n\n\"What is it about this woman that she has shown you that makes you think that she is like some peaceful 'namaste' auntie?\" she continued, adding, \"She's taken photos with cops, she's married to a zionist...she said 'I'm going to be just like [former President] Joe Biden.\"\n\nShockingly, many Black folks took to X arguing that the always-controversial Seales has a point. @MillieBeats, wrote, \"Not even a fan but she 100% correct. Until you n****s ditch the two party system we ain't getting out of this pro war regime.\"\n\nBut while some users agreed with Seales, others like @_Miugler said there's more that Seales should be discussing. \"The problem that people have lays in the time and place. Don’t negate the fight while we have no other weapons bby. Give us options instead of just telling us we wrong lol.\"\n\n\"I think Harris would have tried To get back to the Iran nuclear deal FIRST,\" @reesetheone1 wrote. Almost 10 years ago, then President Barack Obama struck an historic deal with Iran called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). In it, Iran agreed to dismantle their nuclear program; two years after the nuclear deal went into effect, Trump withdrew from it during his first term.\n\nYears later, the Trump's actions ultimately led to rising nuclear concerns between Iran -- which Harris has described as one of our biggest enemies-- and Israel, one of the U.S.'s biggest allies, Israel. \n\nAnother user, @AshariExpresses, said on X Seales needs to stay out of political business. \"Idgaf who Kamala Harris married. That’s nobody’s business. Iran is our greatest enemy,\" they wrote on X. \"Why tf do y’all think they aren’t apart of NATO? Like has she [Seales] not paid attention to any history while she was in school?\"\n\nDuring the last presidential campaign season, an ex-Obama official predicted Harris would've sought a new Iran nuclear deal if she was elected. Trump on the other hand, clearly had different intentions. \n\n\"Harris's policy appears to pursue a conflicted de-escalation with Iran by trying to reach, if not a new nuclear deal, at least a new agreement or understanding that would pause Iran's nuclear weapon development,\" said Arman Mahmoudian, lecturer and international affairs analyst at the University of South Florida.\n\nMore people came in Harris' defense saying arguments like this from Seales are a moot point. \"I don’t understand why so many people still have Kamala’s name in their mouths about what she 'would have' done, when the n***a in charge is actively doing horrible shit.\" @Jeesa_Jay continued, \"Why is Kamala even a topic of conversation?\"\n\nTrump's attack on Iran was met with immediate retaliation from the Middle Eastern country on Monday (June 23). The president reportedly had a \"good advance warning\" of the blitz.","summary":"Would tensions in the Middle East have subsided if Kamala Harris was president instead of Donald Trump?\n\nRead more...","url":"https://www.theroot.com/amanda-seales-trashes-kamala-harris-again-but-heres-wh-2000046821","image":"https://assets-server.theroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/23143328/BeFunky-collage9i-36-scaled.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-23 15:57:53","author":"Phenix S Halley","authors":["Phenix S Halley"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.509}]}
