To paraphrase Monty Python, the climate parrot may still be nailed to its perch at the recent Cop summit in Belem, Brazil – or at Harvard and on CNN – but elsewhere it’s dead. It’s gone to meet its maker, kicked the bucket, shuffled off this mortal coil, run down the curtain and joined the choir invisible. By failing to secure new pledges for a cut in fossil fuels, Cop achieved less than nothing. The venue caught fire, the air conditioning malfunctioned – and delegates were told on arrival not to flush toilet paper. Bill Gates’s recent apologia, in which he conceded that global warming ‘will not lead to humanity’s demise’ after he closed the policy and advocacy office of his climate philanthropy group, is just the latest nail in the coffin.\n\nIn October, the Net Zero Banking Alliance shut down after JPMorgan Chase, Citi-group, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs led a stampede of banks out of the door. Shell and BP have returned to being oil companies, to the delight of their shareholders. Ford is about to cease production of electric pick-ups that nobody wants. Hundreds of other companies are dropping their climate targets. Australia has backed out of hosting next year’s climate conference.\n\nAccording to an analysis by the Washington Post, in the US it is not just the Republicans who have given up on climate change: the Democrat party has stopped talking about it, hardly mentioning it during Kamala Harris’s campaign for president. The topic has dropped to the bottom half of a table of 23 concerns among Swedish youths. Even the European parliament has now voted to exempt many companies from reporting rules that require them to state how they are helping to fight climate change.\n\nIt has been a long, lucrative ride. Predicting the eco-apocalypse has always been a profitable business, spawning subsidies, salaries, consulting fees, air miles, bestsellers and research grants. Different themes took turns as the scare du jour: overpopulation, oil spills, pollution, desertification, mass extinction, acid rain, the ozone layer, nuclear winter, falling sperm counts. Each faded as the evidence became more equivocal, the public grew bored or, in some cases, the problem was resolved by a change in law or practice.\n\nBut no scare grew as big or lasted as long as global warming. I first wrote a doom–laden article for the Economist about carbon dioxide emissions trapping heat in the air in 1987, nearly 40 years ago. I soon realised the effect was real but the alarm was overdone, that feedback effects were exaggerated in the models. The greenhouse effect was likely to be a moderate inconvenience rather than an existential threat. For this blasphemy I was abused, cancelled, blacklisted, called a ‘denier’ and generally deemed evil. In 2010 in the pages of the Wall Street Journal I debated Gates, who poured scorn on my argument that global warming was not likely to be a catastrophe – so it is welcome to see him come round to my view.\n\nThe activists who took over the climate debate, often with minimal understanding of climate science, competed for attention by painting ever more catastrophic pictures of future greenhouse warming. They altered the name to ‘climate change’ so they could blame it for blizzards as well as heatwaves. Then they inflated the language to ‘climate emergency’ and ‘climate crisis’, even as projections of future warming came down.\n\n‘I’m talking about the slaughter, death and starvation of six billion people this century. That’s what the science predicts,’ said Roger Hallam, founder of Extinction Rebellion, in 2019, though the science says no such thing. ‘A top climate scientist is warning climate change will wipe out humanity unless we stop using fossil fuels over the next five years,’ tweeted Greta Thunberg in 2018. Five years later she deleted her tweet and shortly after decided that Palestine was a more promising way of staying in the limelight.\n\nScientists knew that pronouncements like this were nonsense but they turned a blind eye because the alarm kept the grant money coming. Journalists always love exaggeration. Capitalists were happy to cash in. Politicians welcomed the chance to blame others: if a wildfire or a flood devastates your town, point the finger at the changing climate rather than your own failure to prepare. Almost nobody had an incentive to downplay the alarm.\n\nUnlike previous scares, climate fear has the valuable feature that it can always be presented in the future tense. No matter how mild the change in the weather proves to be today, you can always promise Armageddon tomorrow. So it was that for four long decades, climate change alarm went on a protracted march through the institutions, capturing newsrooms, classrooms and boardrooms. By 2020 no meeting, even of a town council or a sports team, was complete without a hand-wringing discussion of carbon footprints.\n\nThe other factor that kept the climate scare alive was that emissions reduction proved impossibly difficult. This was a feature, not a bug: if it had been easy, the green gravy train would have ground to a halt. Reducing sulphur emissions to stop acid rain proved fairly easy, as did banning chlorofluorocarbons to protect the ozone layer. But decade after decade, carbon dioxide emissions just kept on rising no matter how much money and research was thrown at the problem. Cheers!\n\nSwitching to renewable energy made no difference – literally. Here’s the data: the world added 9,000 terawatt-hours of energy consumption from wind and solar in the past decade, but 13,000 from fossil fuels. Not that wind and solar save much carbon dioxide anyway, their machinery being made with coal and their intermittency being backed up by fossil fuels.\n\nDespite trillions of dollars in subsidies, these two ‘unreliables’ still provide just 6 per cent of the world’s energy. Their low-density, high-cost, intermittent power output is of no use to data centres or electric grids, let alone transport and heating, and effectively poisons the economics of building and running new nuclear and gas generation by preventing continuous operation. Quite why it became mandatory among those concerned about climate change to support these unreliables so obsessively is hard to fathom. Subsidy–addiction has a lot to do with it, combined with a general ignorance of thermodynamics.\n\nNow the climate scare is fading, a scramble for the exits is beginning among the big environmental groups. Donations are drying up. Some will switch seamlessly to trying to panic us about artificial intelligence; others will follow Gates and insist that they never said it was the end of the world, just a problem to be solved; a few will even try declaring victory, claiming unconvincingly that promises made at the Paris conference a decade ago have slowed down emissions enough to save the climate.\n\nOf course, Al Gore, the former US vice–president who did more than anybody else to alarm the world about climate change and made a $300 million fortune from it, has been at the recent conference in the Brazilian jungle – the one where they felled a forest to build the access road. As he railed against Gates last month for abandoning the cause and accused him of being bullied by Donald Trump, he sounded like one of those Japanese soldiers emerging from the jungle who did not know the second world war was over.\n\nPerhaps Gore might now regret his exaggerated preachings of hellfire and damnation. In his 2006 film An Inconvenient Truth, for which he shared a Nobel prize, he predicted a sea-level rise of up to 20 feet ‘in the near future’ – out by around 19 feet and nine inches. In 2009 he said there was a 75 per cent chance all the ice in the Arctic Ocean would disappear by 2014. In that year there were five million square kilometres of the stuff at its lowest point – about the same as in 2009. This year there were 4.7 million square kilometres. At the film’s showing at the Sundance Festival, Gore said that unless drastic measures to reduce greenhouse gases were taken within ten years, the world would reach a point of no return. Yet here we are 19 years later.\n\nGore is correct that fear of retribution from the Trump administration drives some of the corporate retreats. President Trump has already cancelled $300 billion of green infrastructure funding and purged government websites of climate rhetoric. But even if the Republicans lose the White House in 2028, it will be hard to reflate the climate balloon. The proportion of Americans greatly worried about climate change is dropping. If Trump takes America out of the 1992 treaty that set up the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change it would require an unlikely two-thirds vote of the Senate to rejoin.\n\nBjorn Lomborg, the Danish economist who is president of the Copenhagen Consensus and has fought a lonely battle against climate exaggeration for decades, recently explained the shift in public opinion: ‘The shrillness of climate doom also wears down voters. While climate change is a real and man-made problem, constant end-of-the-world proclamations from media and campaigners massively overstate the situation.’\n\nA key figure in the collapse of the climatocracy is Chris Wright, the pioneer of extracting shale gas by hydraulic fracturing who was appointed by Trump as energy secretary this year. Wright commissioned a review of climate science by five distinguished academics that set out just how non-frightening the facts of climate change are: slowly rising temperatures, mainly at night in winter and in the north, correspondingly less in daytime in summer and in the tropics where most people live, accompanied by a very slow rise in sea level showing no definite acceleration, minimal if any measurable change in the average frequency and ferocity of storms, droughts and floods – and record low levels of deaths from such causes. Plus a general increase in green vegetation, caused by the extra carbon dioxide.\n\nIndoor air pollution caused by poor people cooking over wood fires because they lack access to gas and electricity kills three million a year. So yes, Gates, influenced by Lomborg and Wright, is correct to say that getting cheap, reliable, clean energy to the poor is by far the more urgent priority.\n\nSources tell me that Wright is treated like a rock star at international conferences: his fellow ministers, especially those from Africa and Asia, are thrilled to talk about the need to get energy to people instead of being hectored about emissions. Only a few western European ministers sneer, but even some of them (the British being an exception) quietly admit that they need to find a way to climb down off their green high horses.\n\nFortunately, they now have convenient cover for doing so: artificial intelligence. We would love to go on subsidising wind and solar, say the Germans privately, but if we are to have data centres, we need lots more reliable and affordable power, so we will build gas turbines and maybe even some nuclear.\n\nLikewise, throughout the tech world of the American west coast, emoting about climate suddenly seems like a luxury belief compared with the need to sign contracts with power suppliers mostly burning natural gas – or get left behind in the AI race. The world’s gas glut is impossible to overstate: thanks to fracking, we have centuries’ worth of cheap gas. The tech bros are piling into nuclear, too, but that won’t address the needs for extra power until well into the next decade, and the need is now.\n\nThe climatastrophe has been a terrible mistake. It diverted attention from real environmental problems, cost a fortune, impoverished consumers, perpetuated indoor pollution and poverty, frightened young people into infertility, wasted years of our time, undermined democracy and corrupted science. Time to bury the parrot.","url":"https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/the-great-climate-climbdown-is-finally-here/","image":"https://www.spectator.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/PepFa_NOBG.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-04 00:05:00","author":"Matt Ridley","authors":["Matt Ridley"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.395},{"id":384789184,"title":"McMahon’s mission to help kids, AI is erasing hearing loss and other commentary","text":"Schools beat: McMahon’s Mission To Help Kids\n\n“Education Secretary Linda McMahon is doing exactly what President Donald J. Trump hired her to do: Clean out a failed education bureaucracy, return power to states and parents, and put students” first, applauds Jorge Martinez at RealClearPolitics. Yet Sen. Elizabeth Warren is “attacking her” — “defending Washington’s control at all costs.” Bad move: “America has spent more per student than any major developed nation,” yet test scores keep falling. “Entire generations of students have cycled through a system in which the federal government grows larger, costs rise, and academic performance declines.” Warren’s “panic” suggests “someone is finally challenging the system” that politicians like her “rely on for power.” But if “we care about our children’s futures,” we should defend McMahon’s mission, “not tear it down for political points.”\n\nHealth watch: AI Is Erasing Hearing Loss\n\n“Thanks to artificial intelligence, the subjective experience of people with profound hearing loss is increasingly indistinguishable from those with normal hearing,” cheers Richard Vigilante at The Free Press. “The Mayo Clinic surgeon I spoke with before my operation” (cochlear implants) “had a little screen about the size of an iPhone hanging from his neck that transcribed his speech into text accurately and immediately.” “Thanks to artificial intelligence, the live captions from Google Meet, Zoom, or FaceTime” are equally good. Plus, tools like Xander eyeglasses can carry a speech-to-text “transcription in the lenses so you can maintain eye contact and catch every spoken word.” “In a world in which speech to text is immediate, nearly flawless, and increasingly universal, my hearing, after degenerating for 30 years, gets better every day.”\n\nMedia watch: Sing Along With Democrats\n\n“The world was ending four weeks ago,” cracks The Wall Street Journal’s Matthew Hennessey, or so Democrats and the media were singing “from the shutdown hymnal” — “Democrats call the tune and the media plays it.” Their new song: “Pete Hegseth Will Be Tried at the Hague.” “Seemingly out of nowhere” Dems warned service members “not to follow what they called ‘unlawful orders.’” And, “serendipity be blessed,” The Washington Post then ran a laughably-sourced story “all but accusing Mr. Hegseth of issuing illegal orders to kill helpless, probably surrendering drug runners hanging off the sides of burning boats.” Yet President Trump “is immune to the narrative-shaping power” of the “Democratic-media” narrative, and his supporters aren’t “dummies,” either.\n\nTech beat: Freedom Wins The AI Race\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang predicts China will “win the AI race,” unless the United States “wins developers worldwide.” But Huang’s “lament” raises “a deeper question,” explains Derek Levine at The Hill: “What kind of system ultimately breeds innovation — one built on control, or one built on freedom?” “Modern Chinese industrial policy” is aims to “absorb, replicate, indigenize,” but Bejing’s system stifles “innovation” and “curiosity.” In America, the ability “to defy authority is democracy’s creative engine.” The AI race “is about which system can nurture human imagination and foster innovation.” And while “speed matters” in winning this race, “freedom remains the true engine of genius.”\n\nConservative: Why Dems Are Losing Latinos\n\n“Hispanics are no longer a reliable Democratic constituency” as evidenced by Donald Trump winning 48% “of the Hispanic vote, just three points shy of Kamala Harris’s share,” hails Daniel Di Martino at City Journal. “Even more striking, he carried 51 percent of foreign-born, naturalized Hispanic immigrants.” It’s further proof that “Hispanics are assimilating into America’s mainstream” and, in a sense, “becoming white, in both culture and identification.” This oft-repeated “story of American integration” happened with Italians who “were considered racially suspect” before disappearing “into the white majority.” Notably, rising “English proficiency is another measure of Hispanic assimilation.” And good news for all: “Hispanics’ cultural assimilation means that in the future, ethnic identity will matter less — and America will be more united.” \n\n— Compiled by The Post Editorial Board","summary":"“Education Secretary Linda McMahon is doing exactly what President Donald J.

Josh Shapiro ripped into former Vice President Kamala Harris, accusing her of spreading “blatant lies” about him in her memoir chronicling her failed White House bid.\n\nShapiro, once on Harris’s shortlist for vice president, flew into a fury when he learned that the former veep, in her campaign tell-all, “107 Days,” described him as arrogant, domineering and captivated by VP perks during the vetting process.\n\n“She wrote that in her book?” Shapiro asked The Atlantic’s Tim Alberta, who highlighted the scathing passages in a sit-down interview published Wednesday.\n\n“That’s complete and utter bulls—t. I can tell you that her accounts are just blatant lies.”\n\nIn her book recounting the 107 days of her doomed campaign, Harris said Shapiro was fixated on the vice presidential residence – measuring drapes, counting bedrooms, and questioning if the Smithsonian would lend Pennsylvania art for display.\n\nHarris wrote that the governor wanted to be “in the room for every decision” if she became president, adding that he often hijacked conversations and frequently needed to be told he wouldn’t have equal power.\n\nAlberta said Shapiro’s reaction shifted between outrage and exasperation while reading the excerpts.\n\nWhen asked if he felt “betrayed” by the vice president, Shapiro lashed out – accusing her of deflecting the blame for her crushing loss to President Trump, according to the article.\n\n“I mean, she’s trying to sell books and cover her ass,” Shapiro snapped before backtracking.\n\n“I shouldn’t say ‘cover her ass.’ I think that’s not appropriate.”\n\nHarris’s book revisits the period after former President Joe Biden’s disastrous debate and the weeks of internal debate that followed before mounting her 107-day campaign against Trump.\n\nShe detailed the vice presidential search, writing that Pete Buttigieg, who is gay, was her “first choice” for running mate but that the pairing was “too big of a risk” due to his sexual orientation.\n\n“We were already asking a lot of America: to accept a woman, a Black woman, a Black woman married to a Jewish man,” Harris wrote in her book.\n\n“Part of me wanted to say, ‘Screw it, let’s just do it.’ But knowing what was at stake, it was too big of a risk.”\n\nHarris ended up picking Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate.\n\nShapiro has since emerged as a potential contender for the 2028 presidential race.","summary":"\"That's complete and utter bulls—t.

The primary race between Mills and Platner has divided Democrats. Some believe Mills, who has won statewide by comfortable margins in both her 2018 and 2022 gubernatorial bids, would be the strongest candidate to take on Collins. Others, however, believe Platner is a candidate who represents a new generation of leadership and would be a stronger contrast against Collins next November.\n\nMaine is likely a must-win for Democrats, who are facing a challenging Senate map. Collins is the only Republican up for reelection in a state carried by former Vice President Kamala Harris next year. Only one GOP-held seat in a state President Donald Trump won by single-digits is up—the North Carolina seat vacated by Republican Senator Thom Tillis.\n\nWith Republicans having a 53-47 Senate majority, the math means Democrats must win both of those states and more solidly conservative states to win a majority.\n\nWhat to Know\n\nThe poll from Z to A Research showed Platner with a double-digit lead over Mills in the Democratic primary. Fifty-eight percent of respondents said they would vote for Platner, while 38 percent said they were supporting Mills.\n\nPlatner’s support was strongest among respondents younger than 50 years old—77 percent of whom said they would vote for him over Mills.\n\nMaine Governor Janet Mills attends a meeting with governors and President Donald Trump at the White House on February 21, 2025.\n\nMills was viewed favorably by 69 percent of respondents and unfavorably by 20 percent. Platner, on the other hand, was viewed favorably by 63 percent of respondents and unfavorably by 15 percent. It surveyed 1,482 likely midterm voters from November 14-18.\n\nThe polling report did not include any general election matchups.\n\nBoth candidates have already drawn national support. Mills has received support from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, as well as Democratic Governors Andy Beshear of Kentucky and Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan. Platner received endorsements from progressives including Senator Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent, and Representative Ro Khanna, a California Democrat.\n\nPolling on the primary has been mixed, with the most recent poll from Maine People’s Research Center pointing to a closer race.\n\nIt showed Platner up only two points over Mills (41 percent to 39 percent), with nearly 20 percent either backing another candidate or saying they were undecided. It surveyed 783 Maine voters from October 26-29 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.\n\nA poll from SoCal Research Center showed Mills up 5 points (41 percent to 36 percent). It surveyed 500 likely primary voters from October 21-25.\n\nPlatner has faced backlash over a series of scandals surrounding old Reddit posts about sexual abuse survivors and rural white Americans, as well as his tattoo resembling the Totenkopf, or “death’s head,” a symbol adopted by Nazis.\n\nPlatner has apologized for the posts and tattoo. He told the Associated Press he had covered the tattoo and said he was unaware the symbol was linked to Nazism. He told CNN the posts were “very much me f****** around the internet.”\n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders responded to Platner’s social media posts in an October interview with Axios: “What he did was he expressed his darkness on the internet. Probably not a brilliant thing to do, alright? And he said things that are stupid, things that were hurtful. He has apologized for them.”\n\nMichigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer endorsed Mills in a social media post: “As a Democratic governor with a record of getting stuff done, @janetmillsforme is the right choice to defeat Susan Collins and hold Republicans accountable in D.C.”\n\nWhat Happens Next\n\nMaine’s primary is set to take place on June 9, 2026. Forecasters view the race as competitive, with both the Cook Political Report and Sabato’s Crystal Ball classifying the race as a toss-up.","summary":"A new poll gave Platner a double-digit lead over Mills among Maine Democrats in the race to take on GOP Senator Susan Collins.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/janet-mills-dealt-polling-blow-in-maine-race-against-graham-platner-11152123","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2201119022-1.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-03 22:17:41","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.017},{"id":384764682,"title":"Gov.

Epps will represent Tennessee’s 7th congressional district in the House succeeding Rep. Mark Green, R-Tenn., who resigned from Congress to pursue a private sector job.\n\nThe Daily Signal spoke with Chapin Fay, the founder and CEO of Lighthouse Public Affairs, about his key takeaways from the Tennessee race. Fay emphasized the Republican victory in spite of the adverse conditions affecting Republican turnout yesterday.\n\n“This was an off-cycle, December special election heading into the midterms, which are historically difficult for the party in power. Despite the national Democrat machine and the media, this Democrat candidate did not even come close,” Fay explained.\n\n“This is not to say there weren’t mistakes made, so I think the Republicans will modify their strategy,” Fay noted, adding “I absolutely think Republicans will take lessons from this.” \n\n“If Democrats are overconfident and run more far left candidates, the midterms won’t be the bloodbath they think it will be,” Fay concluded. As for what more Republicans can do, Fay pointed out that “President [Donald] Trump and his agenda needs to be paying dividends next year.”\n\nHe contended that the president’s priorities of “fewer wars, protecting Americans from the scourge of drugs” are “all good things.” Fay also spotlighted the importance of candidate selection.\n\n“Running a far-left candidate will work in places like NYC, but not Tennessee and certainly not the swing states Trump won. My advice is to run candidates that align with the politics and issues of the district,” he said.\n\n“The desire is to nationalize all these races when members of Congress are local elected officials. Run good candidates that align with the district and the issues but also have a positive policy agenda and clearly articulate it. Have your three points and run with it,” Fay continued.\n\nMatthew Bartlett, a co-founder of Darby Field Advisors and a Trump administration official during the president’s first term, told The Daily Signal that “Just like in New Jersey, Virginia, New York, it’s no surprise which party won, but it’s the margins that count because the margins lead to money and momentum.”\n\n“It is not an unmitigated disaster because the Republican candidate didn’t lose, but a nine-point win in an R-22 district a few months back should absolutely raise eyebrows,” Bartlett continued, referencing Trump’s victory over Kamala Harris in the district in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nBartlett contended that it was affordability issues that had brought the GOP to power.\n\n“You need to recognize just how tough it is for people in America and demonstrate every day that you are fighting on their behalf,” Bartlett said.\n\nMatt Terrill, the managing partner of Firehouse Strategies, a public affairs firm in Washington, also emphasized affordability in comments to The Daily Signal.\n\n“Democrats want to take your money and spend your money, and the only thing you get for it is higher prices,” Terrill explained as a potential line of messaging when asked about what advice he would give to Republicans regarding a winning message.\n\n“Every campaign is about ‘the now.’ What are you doing for me now,” Terrill noted. \n\nThe public affairs expert expressed that GOP elections without Trump on the ballot would be different than when the president was also running.\n\n“President Trump is able to perform quite well with younger voters and traditionally Democrat voters. But in the 2024 election they were turning out for him,” Terrill said. \n\n“Looking at the playbook in 2024, Republicans won on safety and security and on affordability,” Terrill concluded.","summary":"GOP strategists are weighing in on what Republican candidate Matt Van Epps&#8217;s victory in yesterday&#8217;s special congressional election in Tennessee means for Republican chances in...

Walz unsuccessfully ran as former Vice President Kamala Harris’ vice presidential nominee in 2024.\n\nThere’s already a sizable line-up of Republicans seeking to unseat Walz, including Minnesota House Speaker Lisa Demuth and business executive Kendall Qualls. But Lindell is confident he would come out on top.\n\n“If there was someone to win, it would be me,” Lindell told the Star Tribune.\n\nBorn and raised in Minnesota, Lindell dropped out of college around 1979 and became addicted to crack, cocaine and gambling, according to CNBC. In 2004, he founded MyPillow, a bedding company, which propelled him to financial success. In 2019, he published a memoir titled What are the Odds? From Crack Addict to CEO.\n\nLindell — whose upbeat infomercials became ubiquitous on television — emerged as an early supporter of President Donald Trump in 2016, attending his election eve watch party. Since then, he’s become one of the president’s staunchest allies, repeatedly echoing his baseless claim that the 2020 election was fraudulent.\n\nHe has joined the president at numerous campaign events, participated in multiple White House press briefings and addressed the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), an annual gathering of conservatives. Trump also frequently reposts Lindell on Truth Social.\n\n“The uni-party, the deep state globalists and the media tried to completely bury the truth about the 2020 election,” Lindell told a CPAC audience in February. “Four years later, evil has failed.”\n\nSuch claims have cost him. In June, a jury ruled that he must pay $2.3 million to Eric Coomer, a former product strategy director at Dominion Voting Systems, which Lindell alleged helped rig the 2020 election in former President Joe Biden’s favor.\n\nFollowing the news that Lindell filed paperwork to run for governor, some MAGA social media users reacted with glee, with one writing on X, “Maybe he can turn Minnesota around.”\n\n“It takes a BUSINESSMAN under fire like Mike to do the job,” Arizona State Senator Wendy Rogers wrote in a post. “No one loves our country more than Mike Lindell!”\n\nBut more moderate Republicans worry that choosing Lindell as the party’s nominee could weaken their chances of reclaiming the governor’s mansion, according to the Star Tribune. The state has not elected a GOP governor since 2006, and it hasn’t voted for a Republican president since 1972.\n\nDemocrats appear enthusiastic about the possibility of running against a MAGA firebrand.\n\nIn September, after Lindell expressed interest in running, Walz wrote on X, “Donald Trump’s pick for Governor of Minnesota? Mike Lindell. Join our campaign and make sure Trump and Lindell never get their hands on Minnesota.”\n\nMinnesota DFL chair Richard Carlbom told the Star Tribune that Lindell “represents exactly what today’s Republican Party has become: conspiratorial, extremist, and weird.”\n\nSpokespeople for Lindell and Walz did not immediately respond to requests for comment from The Independent.","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/mypillow-founder-turned-maga-superstar-204107246.html","image":"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/.JBrMinCkUqKkQ.9yuYpBw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTI0MDA7aD0xNjAwO2NmPXdlYnA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/b322c596f7b50a9df8859ee73fef4784","video":"","publish_date":"2025-12-03 21:42:24","author":"Brendan Rascius","authors":["Brendan Rascius"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.017},{"id":384759904,"title":"Democratic strategist says Tennessee nominee was ‘fringe of a fringe,’ doomed party's chances","text":"While some Democrats described Aftyn Behn's single-digit loss in Tennessee's 7th Congressional District, a district that President Donald Trump won by 22 points last year, as an \"overperformance,\" a team of Democratic researchers and analysts called the special election a \"missed opportunity\" for the party. Republican Matt Van Epps defeated Behn by about 9 percentage points on Tuesday, closing out a high-profile special election to replace former Rep. Mark Green, R-Tenn. Despite losing, Democrats said Behn's inroads in the ruby-red district — along with November's gubernatorial wins in New Jersey and Virginia — proves their party is \"on the offense.\" This is where Welcome, a pro-Democratic Party organization, disagrees. In an October report entitled \"Deciding to Win,\" they cautioned their fellow party members that far-left positions are turning off voters. And on Wednesday, they poured cold water on the echo chamber that framed Behn's loss as a win. \"The point is to win,\" said Liam Kerr, co-founder of Welcome when asked by Fox News Digital about the Tennessee election results. \"Running a far-left candidate clearly did not put Democrats in the best position to win.\" DECISION DAY: TRUMP, SPEAKER JOHNSON, AOC BLITZ CAMPAIGN TRAIL IN MUST-WIN SPECIAL HOUSE ELECTION FOR GOP Kerr and his colleagues argued in the \"Deciding to Win\" report that Democrats should moderate their positions on identity politics and cultural issues while embracing affordability, border security and public safety ahead of competitive midterm elections expected next year. TRUMP-BACKED REPUBLICAN KEEPS CRUCIAL CONGRESSIONAL SEAT IN GOP HANDS WITH SPECIAL ELECTION VICTORY \"Aftyn Behn was a missed opportunity,\" Simon Bazelon, a research fellow at Welcome and a lead author of the report, said in a statement following Behn's loss. \"Republicans were unusually vulnerable, but the right message isn't enough with the wrong track record. Democrats in red districts can’t just talk about affordability and hope voters don't notice they walk left on everything else.\" Behn, a state representative and former healthcare community organizer, told supporters at a local Democratic Party office in Nashville on Tuesday morning that \"whatever happens, win or lose, you’ve inspired a country. You’ve shown people the South has something to say.\" \"For me, we've already won over the hearts and minds of so many Tennesseans and across the country,\" Behn told Fox News Digital minutes later when asked if she's a winner even without an election victory. \"What starts here changes this country.\" Despite Behn running an effective affordability campaign fueled by grassroots support and a savvy social media presence, Bazelon said that \"Republicans will make sure the voters know\" if Democratic candidates do not match their district. In the final days of her campaign, Behn dodged accountability for her past comments, including those calling to dissolve the Nashville police department, and was plagued by a resurfaced clip where she lamented that she hated Nashville. \"I hate the city, I hate the bachelorettes, I hate the pedal taverns, I hate country music, I hate all of the things that make Nashville apparently an 'it' city to the rest of the country. But I hate it,\" Behn said in a 2020 podcast. \"Despite a well-run race and significant investment, Tennessee voters knew Aftyn Behn did not share their views,\" Bazelon said. Elaborating on Bazelon's critique, Kerr told Fox News Digital that it was \"obvious that her stances on immigration and crime that are so out of step with the broad American public, not to mention a red district like Tennessee's 7th, would come back to haunt her and make it almost impossible for her to win.\" \"It's not just that she's out of step with the district, she's completely out of step with the American public on crime and immigration,\" the Democratic strategist said, in light of the resurfaced clip of Behn \"bullying\" U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. While Republicans relentlessly focused on Behn's past comments in the lead-up to Election Day, high-profile national Democrats, including former Vice Presidents Kamala Harris and Al Gore and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., campaigned for the \"AOC of Tennessee.\" And while Democrats were successful in firing up the far-left base who are fed up with Trump's sweeping, second-term agenda, Kerr said that momentum isn't enough to deliver a win. \"Persuasion is a way to turn people up,\" he said. \"Only trying to turn out your base is not a recipe for success, and so replicating what happened in November, not what happened in December, means persuading people who have supported President Trump in the past to pull the lever for a Democrat.\" Kerr described the recipe for Democratic success in the 2026 midterm elections as nominating \"conservative Democrats,\" and explained that Govs.-elect Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill won, in part, because they are \"hard to caricature as leftists.\" \"We need centrist democrats to more aggressively intervene to bring the party back to where the American public is, particularly in red districts,\" he said, describing Behn as \"not just the fringe\" but the \"fringe of a fringe\" candidate for the Democratic Party. Moving forward, Kerr said the \"achilles heel for the Democratic Party\" will be the \"myth that you can just talk about affordability and forget your extreme, unpopular positions, and that they won't be raised to voters.\" While Welcome's Democratic strategists are urging candidates back to the center in hopes of winning back the House and Senate in 2026, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the Democratic National Committee both took Tuesday night's results as proof the party is on the \"offense\" – despite losing. \"Tonight’s election results prove exactly what the DCCC has known all along – Democrats are on offense not just in the standard swing districts but in red terrain across the country. Our expansive battlefield shows that Democrats are ready to fight in rural districts, in Latino communities, in Trump country, and everywhere in between.

It Just Imploded.","text":"Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nThe legal battle over the defunding of Planned Parenthood reached a new milestone this week, with a federal order blocking enforcement of a key provision of President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill. Planned Parenthood had previously won an injunction blocking enforcement of the measure, which would defund the organization, only to see that order reversed by the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals. In a suit brought by 22 states, the same federal judge issued an entirely different order blocking the defunding. The argument in the states’ case seems stronger than the one made by the Planned Parenthood plaintiffs. That’s hardly a guarantee if—and when—the Supreme Court’s conservative supermajority gets involved, but the ruling, and the publicity it might draw, can still make a difference. The longer the state plaintiffs can keep funding for Planned Parenthood alive, and make sure the issue remains in the public eye, the more likely it becomes that Republicans will use the abortion issue to shoot themselves in the foot in 2026.\n\nThe One Big Beautiful Bill represents the anti-abortion movement’s most significant win in Trump’s second term. The bill bars Medicaid funding for certain “prohibited entities,” which are defined to include 1) nonprofits that 2) qualify as “essential community providers” under federal law, 3) offer abortion, and 4) primarily engage in reproductive health, family planning, and related medical care. The defunding measure is scheduled to expire before the 2026 midterms.\n\nThe provision almost immediately sparked legal challenges. Planned Parenthood’s separate lawsuit asserts that the provision improperly penalizes affiliates that don’t provide abortions for aligning with an organization that does (and that advocates for reproductive rights). Arguments in this vein persuaded Judge Indira Talwani, an Obama nominee, to issue an injunction earlier this year, but the 1st Circuit reversed that decision. Since then, at least 20 Planned Parenthood affiliates have been forced to close.\n\nThis week, Talwani issued an injunction in an entirely different case brought by more than 20 state plaintiffs. The states don’t focus on the idea that the bill targets or punishes Planned Parenthood. Instead, the plaintiffs claim that it is hard to figure out exactly what the One Big Beautiful Bill requires them to do. They rely on doctrine developed under the spending clause of the Constitution. When Congress relies on the spending clause to pass legislation, the Supreme Court has held that lawmakers must make clear any conditions on federal funding. That’s because the clause is supposed to operate like a contract: Congress offers federal funds subject to certain terms, and states can make an informed choice by identifying which strings are attached to the money.\n\nThe states argue that the One Big Beautiful Bill doesn’t make its conditions clear enough because it’s hard to determine who falls into the category of prohibited entities. The legislation doesn’t define reproductive health or family planning or explain how to determine whether a provider “primarily” offers this kind of service. The bill also has a funding threshold for prohibited entities, which must have had at least $800,000 in Medicaid expenses in 2023. The states point to this requirement too, arguing that it would be difficult to calculate such expenditures for interstate organizations like Planned Parenthood when they usually track only their own Medicaid expenditures.\n\nThe Trump Department of Health and Human Services responds that it really isn’t that hard to identify such providers, especially when they’re affiliated with Planned Parenthood. But in the Planned Parenthood litigation, the administration has stressed that the One Big Beautiful Bill targets not just Planned Parenthood. Talwani is convinced that Congress didn’t provide clear enough guidance to states about who else is subject to the defunding measure—and forced states to shoulder Medicaid expenses themselves if a provider guessed incorrectly about whether they fell into the category Congress had in mind.\n\nThe state plaintiffs might not do any better than Planned Parenthood as this case heads for a potential reckoning at the Supreme Court. The Trump administration argues that at most, Congress needs to make clear that there is a condition on spending; it doesn’t specify that legislators spell out exactly what it is or how states can fulfill it. The argument isn’t a slam dunk: In litigation about the Biden administration’s COVID-era American Rescue Plan Act, some circuit courts held that the spending clause required that the precise obligations of a funding condition be apparent too. Ironically, SCOTUS hasn’t made especially clear under the clause precisely how clear a condition needs to be.\n\nIf the case lands before the court, the conservative supermajority may ultimately reject the states’ argument. But the more this litigation can preserve funding for providers like Planned Parenthood, and the more the issue remains in the news, the worse that will be for the congressional Republicans whose votes would be needed to extend defunding.\n\nPlanned Parenthood facilities have devised a number of strategies to weather defunding before 2026. Some states have announced additional funding; other providers have surrendered their status as essential community providers or hoped to cover some lost funds through private donations. There’s no question that the longer defunding lasts, the harder it will be for Planned Parenthood to manage.\n\nThere’s the rub for congressional Republicans. Months before the midterms, they will have to decide whether to extend defunding or allow the related provision to expire. The Republicans who passed the One Big Beautiful Bill may have hoped to avoid this political Hobson’s choice by making defunding temporary. That way, members running in swing districts could dodge an abortion issue that still could wound the GOP, while the damage to Planned Parenthood would already be done. The more time this litigation can buy, the easier it will be for Planned Parenthood to find ways around the bill, and the higher the stakes will become for a potential defunding vote next year.\n\nIncreasingly, it seems that Republicans in Congress will throw caution to the wind and make the defunding permanent. After all, Senate Republicans seem ready to let health care costs skyrocket unless Democrats agree to stringent new abortion regulations for the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAll of that suggests that the GOP fundamentally misunderstands what happened in the 2024 election. Stressing abortion wasn’t enough to get Kamala Harris across the line, but it’s a stretch to believe that opposing reproductive rights helped Republicans. Trump, after all, tried to avoid the issue; many congressional Republicans echoed his promise to leave the issue to the states. Ballot-initiative wins and polls suggest that Americans don’t like abortion bans any more than they did in 2023, and special election results have been ominous for the GOP.\n\nStrangely, what the party seems to have taken from all of this is that foregrounding its opposition to abortion will help it win. Whatever else comes of the defunding litigation, it has set a political trap for congressional Republicans, and from the looks of it, they may be ready to walk right in.","summary":"The legal battle over the defunding of Planned Parenthood reached a new milestone this week.","url":"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2025/12/republicans-2026-abortion-planned-parenthood.html?via=rss","image":"https://compote.slate.com/images/1102931d-a613-43a6-89b0-7b5e0f67aacb.jpeg?crop=2432%2C1621%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-03 21:36:56","author":"Mary Ziegler","authors":["Mary Ziegler"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.448},{"id":384764804,"title":"Trump's Brutal Dig at JD Vance: Prez, 79, Appears to Call His Own Veep 'Incompetent' During Bizarre Rant About Tim Walz","text":"Donald Trump has thrown Vice President JD Vance under the bus while ranting about his former Democratic opponent and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, RadarOnline.com can reveal. \n\nThe president seemingly confessed to thinking his running mate was \"incompetent\" while bashing Walz's performance in the 2024 vice presidential debate during a televised cabinet meeting on Tuesday, December 2.Trump Shades Vance as 'Incompetent'While Trump, 79, appeared to doze off throughout the meeting, he seemingly caught a burst of energy when a reporter asked if he thought Walz should resign over the welfare fraud scandal in his state. \n\nThe president took the question as an opportunity to bash Walz, and Vance caught a stray as the president mocked their debate skills. \n\n\"Look, I think the man’s a grossly incompetent man.

That’s the case with Raoul Peck’s “Orwell: 2+2=5,” the year’s timeliest documentary about a writer who’s been dead for 75 years. \n\nThe film uses the British author George Orwell’s final years, 1948 to 1950, in which he finished “Nineteen Eighty-Four” in a sanitarium on a remote Scottish island, as a jumping-off point for an examination of the playbook for totalitarianism as it was practiced in Orwell’s dystopian classic but also by governments around the world over the past century. The film’s narration is delivered by actor Damian Lewis in Orwell’s own words, laying with remarkable prescience the ways in which oppression takes hold.\n\n“I Am Not Your Negro” director Peck, a native of Haiti whose family fled that country during the dictatorship of François Duvalier in the early 1960s, deliberately downplayed the use of Orwell’s tactics by Donald Trump’s administration. But viewers of his film, which premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in May, will make those connections.\n\nIt feels to me that this is a film where every week since you finished it, something has happened that would’ve been in the movie if you were still working on it.\n\nPeck: Oh, yeah. The most characteristic one is “Secretary of War.” Come on. I think even Orwell would not go that far. It’s crazy. But the guideline for me was that I didn’t want to make a film exclusively about Donald Trump. \n\nAnd by the way, when I started the movie, we were all pretty much sure that Kamala Harris would be president, and the film was as urgent for me as it is now with Trump. I don’t make films for just a moment. I make a film the same way Orwell wrote, in a way that is as efficient today as it was in his time.\n\nThat’s why throughout the film, I use the character of the great leader — whoever he is, whether in democracy or in fascism or in socialism. The cult of personality of the great leader is a way of controlling the people. The tools never change. You know exactly when the king is naked, even though the king and his enablers do not want you to see that. But when Bush in Iraq had to duck when a journalist threw a shoe at him, that was a moment of history where for a little bit, he became just a man, you know? And that’s what will happen to Trump at some point. Something will show the ridiculousness of the whole thing — despite, of course, the tragic implications for everybody.\n\nWas it an easy decision when (executive producer) Alex Gibney approached you about making a movie on George Orwell?\n\nOrwell, how can you say no? If it was just a film on “Nineteen Eighty-Four,” I would’ve said no. But the total body of work, I know what I can do with that. I knew that the first thing I needed to do was to find the core story, because I’m telling a story, not a biography. And in this particular case, it didn’t take me long. I settled on the last year of his life. He’s dying. He knows “Nineteen Eighty-Four” is an important book for him, and he doesn’t know if he will be able to finish it. So right there, you have a story with a dramatic structure and a character.\n\nAnd that character supplies your entire script, which must have required a lot of poring through his writings.\n\nIt was work. Because if you go into that big trove of stuff, you’ll be lost if you don’t know what you’re looking for. I made a lot of new discoveries. I was surprised sometimes that he was so precise in his descriptions and that it fit exactly what’s going on now. There were moments of “Oh my God, that’s impossible.” The richness of the text was so great that my first libretto, as I call it, was absolutely incredible.\n\nLiving in Haiti and then in the Congo, you must have grown up sensitive to the signs of totalitarianism.\n\nOh, yeah. That’s something that even today, when there is a police roadblock, I know anything can happen. All my life, I’ve seen roadblocks. In Haiti, I remember I was in my pajamas in the back of my mother’s car around midnight. My mother was looking for my father, who had not come home. There were roadblocks because there was an 8 o’clock curfew. And I remember flashlights all of a sudden. I used that image in several of my films because it stuck in my head. It’s sheer terror.\n\nIf you were making the film thinking that Kamala Harris was going to be president, did you change the film at all to focus on the world into which it was going to be released?\n\nNo. On the contrary, I made sure that I had less Trump. I didn’t want to make a film about him. Otherwise, we could have done hours and hours of stupidities and absurdities.\n\nBut by the same token, the film is coming out at a time when everyone who watches it will be hyperaware of the way that this playbook is being used by the United States right now.\n\nAbsolutely. The weird coincidence of this moment is that we are totally in it. You can basically quote the whole film and have an immediate correspondence with what is happening: the destruction of words, the switching of words’ meaning, you know, like the slogan “war is peace.” You’re talking of peace, but you are making war.\n\nIn the film, Orwell talks about the death of objective truth, which fits in this age of social media and AI.\n\nYeah. One of the definitions I like to quote is that the degradation of language is the condition for the degradation of democracy. Once you know the world doesn’t mean the same thing for everybody, the world of truth and facts doesn’t exist. Or at least they are opinions. Those are the precise tools that every authoritarian regime uses. The attack on the media is always, let’s attack one so that we create fear in all the others.\n\nSomething else that Orwell says in the film is that if there is hope, it is in the proles, the proletariat.\n\nHe doesn’t say that’s what happens, but that’s what needs to happen. It’s a way of turning to you to say, “Hey, I explained everything to you. Now I can’t do the job for you.” He says it is all of us, the masses who never had the occasion to say anything. If you come together and decide to do something, there is hope.\n\nIn Q&As, people in the audience ask me that question all the time: “So, what next?” I say, “Well, next will be whatever you decide.” Because neutrality or the absence of reaction is also a political position, and you’re usually coming from a position of privilege if you can say that. If you’re not going to be among the first to be hit, you can say, “Well, I’m waiting to see.” But others have already paid the price.","summary":"TheWrap magazine: The “Orwell: 2+2=5” filmmaker emphasizes the lesson's told are bigger than just one leader and that the tools for controlling people \"never change\"\n\n\nThe post Raoul Peck Says His Timely George Orwell Doc Is About More Than Just Trump&#8217;s &#8216;Stupidities and Absurdities&#8217; appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/raoul-peck-wanted-less-donald-trump-in-george-orwell-documentary/","image":"https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ORWELL-Courtesy-of-NEON.jpg?fit=1200%2C675&quality=89&ssl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-03 21:14:40","author":"Donald Trump,Steve Pond","authors":["Donald Trump","Steve Pond"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.073},{"id":384766192,"title":"Beware: Hollywood Reportedly Lining Up Behind the One Guy You Never Want to See As President","text":"I call California Gov.

While the vast majority of the state's residents are likely to be kind, generous souls with good Germanic and Nordic hearts, their public officials are not exactly covering themselves in glory these days.\n\nFor instance, Tim Walz. It's hard to know where to start with the scandals surrounding Minnesota's Democrat governor – and Kamala Harris's former running mate – but perhaps the most recent one is a good place. As RedState has been reporting, it's looking a whole lot like Walz oversaw or, at the very least, turned a blind eye to over $1 billion in taxpayer money being stolen by the Feeding Our Future fraud scandal allegedly perpetrated by some in the state's Somali community (more on that here).\n\nWalz's mismanagement has certainly put the state on the map, and not in a good way. As our own Bob Hoge noted earlier Wednesday, the Trump administration has reportedly deployed over 100 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to Minneapolis to track down Somalis who are in the country illegally and give them a one-way ticket home.\n\nRELATED: ICE Storm Reportedly Hits Minneapolis After Massive Somali Welfare Fraud Schemes Uncovered\n\nThings Are Really Heating Up for Tim Walz As New Investigations Over Fraud Scandal Drop\n\nSadly, it turns out that Tim Walz isn't the only public official failing Minnesotans right now. A story that has been gaining steam the last few days involves a Democrat-appointed judge by the name of Sarah West, who took it upon herself to negate the jury conviction of Abdifatah Yusuf, who, along with his wife, was found guilty on six charges of committing $7.2 million in Medicaid fraud. They used their ill-gotten gains to fund an extremely lavish lifestyle that most taxpayers can only dream of.\n\nThe attorney general's office said Yusuf received Medicaid money by billing for services not provided and services that lacked \"any documentation,\" and overbilled for services. Yusuf allegedly used the money to fund a \"lavish lifestyle,\" including shopping sprees at luxury stores such as Coach, Michael Kors, Nike, Nordstrom and more.\n\nIt's been reported that \"Yusuf funneled more than $1 million from their business to his personal account and withdrew over $387,000 in cash, according to the release.\"\n\nJudge West, who was appointed by Tim Walz's Democrat predecessor, Mark Dayton, decided to throw out Yusuf's conviction on \"six counts of aiding and abetting theft by swindle, over $35,000,\" with her reasoning being that the prosecution \"relied heavily on circumstantial evidence.\"\n\nRepublican lawmakers in the state are calling out the judge as an \"extremist\" who's allowing her ideology to run her courtroom.\n\n\"Judicial reform is necessary in Minnesota… This wasn't an extreme situation,\" [state Sen. Michael] Holmstrom told Fox News Digital. \"This is just how she operates.\"\"I think that she is a true extremist, that her ideology is running her courtroom and damaging our justice system. People in Minnesota are questioning whether or not the judicial system can be trusted. And with judges like this, I see why,\" he added.\n\nThe jury that returned the convictions isn't too pleased, either. Jury foreperson Ben Walfoort said it wasn't a difficult decision. Per Walfoort, \"The deliberation took probably four hours at most. Based off of the state's evidence that was presented, it was beyond a reasonable doubt.\" He added, \"I am shocked. I'm shocked based off of all of the evidence that was presented to us and the obvious guilt that we saw based off of the said evidence.\"\n\nAn extremist, Democrat-appointed judge run amok in Minnesota – who saw that one coming?\n\nEditor's Note: Unelected federal judges are hijacking President Trump's agenda and insulting the will of the people\n\nHelp us expose out-of-control judges dead set on halting President Trump's mandate for change.

I wouldn’t bet on it. What goes down must also go back up.”\n\nThe AP also quoted Metropolitan State University’s James Densley, who said, “Because there’s only a few dozen mass killings in a year, a small change could look like a wave or a collapse. 2025 looks really good in historical context, but we can’t pretend like that means the problem is gone for good.”\n\nThe article also quoted Florida State University’s Emma Fridel:\n\nIf you look at the deaths from firearms, both in homicides and suicides, the numbers are staggering. We lose the same number of people every year to gun violence as the number of casualties we experienced in the Korean War. The number one cause of death for children is guns.\n\nA point of clarity on Fridel’s claims: The Defense Casualty Analysis System puts the total number of American casualties in the Korean War at more than 54,000. The highest number of gun-related deaths in the United States in a given year was 48,830, according to Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\n\nMoreover, Fridel said, “The number one cause of death for children is guns.” This same false claim was made by former President Joe Biden, failed presidential candidate Kamala Harris, and myriad other leftists, including Hollywood celebrities.

The host asked which legacy media outlet is best at reporting straight facts rather than biased opinions.\n\n“I actually think — I actually think that the mainstream news still does a very good job of just presenting facts,” Obama stammered. “I think cable, regardless of the cable station, has fallen prey to the same economic imperatives that we’re seeing in every other type of news, which is, you are deliberately controversial, deliberately aggressive, deliberately trying to make people feel angry and aggrieved, because that attracts attention.”\n\nBarack Obama says that the mainstream media still does a very good job of presenting facts, which will completely ridiculous, is at least funnier than anything Stephen Colbert or Jimmy Kimmel have said in yearspic.twitter.com/YX45jCPS0b— Ian Miller (@ianmSC) December 3, 2025\n\nObama is right about legacy media outlets making people “angry and aggrieved,” but if you watch him speak, you can tell he doesn’t really believe what he says about the media “presenting facts.”\n\nHe should know. During his tenure in office, the legacy media did little to hold his administration accountable. Even after he was in office, they peddled the lie that he had a “scandal-free administration.”\n\nIt’s also worth pointing out that the data support the idea that the legacy media is clearly biased in favor of the Democratic Party. The Media Research Center (MRC) conducted an extensive analysis of media coverage. It found that during the first 100 days of President Donald Trump’s second term, legacy media delivered 92 percent negative coverage of his administration.\n\nThis was an increase from Trump’s first term, when the same outlets gave 89 percent negative coverage within the first 100 days.\n\nBut when it came to former President Joe Biden, the media gave him 59 percent positive coverage during his first 100 days. During the 2024 presidential election, former Vice President Kamala Harris received 78 percent positive coverage while Trump received 85 percent negative.\n\nBut that’s not all.\n\nHarvard Kennedy School’s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy produced similar findings. Their study found that news coverage was 80 percent negative during Trump’s first 100 days. \n\nLegacy media outlets have gone to great lengths to smear Republicans. They pushed the Russia collusion hoax. They created the “fine people” hoax. They even went after a bunch of high school kids from Covington Catholic school because they wore MAGA hats.\n\nClaiming the media isn’t biased is like telling people sharks can live on land. It’s obvious for anyone who pays attention. There is a reason why trust in media has been at all-time lows for years — and not even Barack Obama can clean this up.\n\nEditor’s Note: Do you enjoy Townhall’s conservative reporting that takes on the radical left and woke media?

Jamie Raskin (D-MD), the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, has launched an investigation into CBS News and its parent company Paramount over whether Donald Trump “improperly influenced and coerced” the network’s editing of the president’s recent interview with 60 Minutes.\n\nRaskin announced his probe in a letter sent to CBS News’ recently installed ombudsman Kenneth Weinstein on Wednesday, adding that Weinstein – a one-time Trump appointee and conservative think tank leader – appears to be “acting as a government regulator and censor enforcing Trump’s demands for more pro-Trump content.” \n\nThe investigation comes a month after Democrats floated a possible FCC probe over the omission of several exchanges between interviewer Norah O’Connell and the president, including a tense back-and-forth over his pardon of crypto billionaire Changpeng Zhao, Trump’s boast about Paramount settling his lawsuit over another 60 Minutes interview, and his praise for CBS News’ new leaders.\n\n“It is one thing for CBS to make independent editorial decisions protected by the First Amendment. It is quite another to make edits at the President’s demand out of fear of retribution,” Raskin wrote. “The double standard here undermines public trust and demonstrates how Paramount’s capitulation has compromised CBS News’s independence. The American people deserve to know whether their news is shaped by journalistic judgment or by Donald Trump.”\n\nThe Independent has reached out to CBS News and Paramount for comment.\n\nDemocrats and press freedom organizations have promised investigations and lawsuits following Paramount’s decision to pay Trump $16 million to settle his “meritless” lawsuit over 60 Minutes’ editing of a 2024 interview with then-Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, which the president claimed amounted to election interference.\n\nThe settlement came weeks before Trump’s hand-picked FCC chairman Brendan Carr approved Paramount’s long-delayed $8.4 billion merger with Skydance Media. House Democrats have also demanded answers about Skydance chief David Ellison’s concessions to the Trump administration days before the merger approval, which included assurances that Paramount would eliminate diversity hiring policies and a vow to install an ombudsman to review “complaints of bias” at CBS News.\n\nBeyond that, Democrats have also taken issue with Paramount’s decision – just days before the merger was approved – to cancel vocal Trump critic Stephen Colbert’s top-rated late-night television show, as well as the president’s claim that he reached a secret “side deal” with Ellison to extract up to $20 million of pro-Trump programming as part of the 60 Minutes settlement.\n\n“The concessions President Trump forced from Paramount, including the settlement, the free advertising, and the installation of a presidentially demanded newsroom ‘minder,’ were on full display during the recent interview,” Raskin noted in his recent letter.\n\nParamount, meanwhile, has repeatedly asserted that the company has no knowledge of a separate deal between Ellison and Trump. At the time of the settlement, Paramount also noted that it didn’t include any statement of apology and regret, and that the money would be allocated to Trump’s future presidential library.\n\n“This lawsuit is completely separate from, and unrelated to, the Skydance transaction and the FCC approval process. We will abide by the legal process to defend our case,” the company said in a statement at the time of the Skdance merger.\n\nThe settlement with Trump also included an agreement that going forward, 60 Minutes would “release transcripts of interviews with eligible U.S. presidential candidates after such interviews have aired, subject to redactions as required for legal or national security concerns.” It was the release of the full transcript of Trump’s sitdown with O’Donnell last month that prompted criticism of the program’s editing.\n\n“And, actually, 60 Minutes paid me a lot of money,” Trump said during a portion of the interview that was not televised but included in the online transcript. “And you don’t have to put this on, because I don’t want to embarrass you, and I’m sure you’re not … I think you have a great, new leader, frankly, who’s — the young woman that’s leading your whole enterprise is a great, from what I know.” \n\nThe “young woman” he was talking about is CBS News editor-in-chief Bari Weiss, the heterodox founder of “anti-woke” digital media The Free Press who was recently hired by Ellison to run the network’s newsroom. Ellison, whom the president has repeatedly praised as a “great man” who is “going to do the right thing with” CBS, also paid $150 million to purchase The Free Press.\n\nAnother exchange that drew notice for not being included in the televised portion was O’Donnell pressing Trump on his pardon of Zhao, noting that the Binance founder’s ties to the Trump family’s cryptocurrency company raised corruption concerns.” I'd rather not have you ask the question,” the president said in an unaired moment.\n\nNoting that “turmoil inside CBS has been mounting for months” since the Trump settlement and the network’s perceived rightward shift under Ellison’s new regime, Raskin called for Weinstein to prove that he’s not at the network to rubber-stamp the president’s agenda.\n\n“These editorial deletions underscore the gravity of the moment for CBS’s new ombudsman, Kenneth Weinstein, who now faces a clear test of independence: whether to defend the network’s journalistic integrity or enable the President’s ongoing efforts to coercively dominate the press,” the Democratic lawmaker wrote.\n\nAdditionally, pointing out that Trump has continued to threaten other news organizations with massive lawsuits while extracting settlements over frivolous claims, insisting that those actions “reflect an alarming pattern of using government power to punish critical reporting and reward compliance,” Raskin said it was apparent CBS was following the president’s orders.\n\n“The facts here are clear. President Trump directed CBS to edit his own interview after suing the network for editing his opponent’s interview, and CBS complied with his requests and omitted its anchor’s questions about Trump’s pardons,” he argued in his letter to Weinstein.\n\nThe Democrat further requested a written assessment of Trump’s intervention, a breakdown of the network’s editorial guidelines, and any communication and guidance regarding the 60 Minutes interview.","summary":"‘The double standard here undermines public trust and demonstrates how Paramount’s capitulation has compromised CBS News’s independence,” Jamie Raskin wrote on Wednesday.","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-60-minutes-democrat-investigation-b2877536.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/11/03/16/31/Screenshot-Capture-2025-11-03-10-23-19.png?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/FoNE7fNz-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-12-03 19:40:08","author":"Justin Baragona","authors":["Justin Baragona"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.423},{"id":384756928,"title":"Key takeaways as Democrats overperform in Tennessee special election","text":"WASHINGTON ‒ Republicans avoided a major Democratic upset in a closely watched Tennessee special congressional election that turned into a surprisingly tight race in an overwhelmingly red district.\n\nStill, while Republicans can breathe a sigh of relief for averting a disaster, Tennessee's 7th congressional special election provided another warning sign for Republicans of a possible blue wave in the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nHere are key takeaways from Republican Matt Vann Epps' victory over Democrat Aftyn Behn:\n\nDemocrats continue to overperform nationally\n\nVan Epps, a combat veteran and former state government official, defeated Behn, a liberal Democratic state representative by 9 percentage points, 54%-45%, in a Middle Tennessee district Trump carried by 22 points in the 2024 presidential election. He will replace retired Rep. Mark Green, R-Tennessee.\n\nThat amounts to a sizable 13-point swing in Democrats' direction, continuing a pattern of Democratic overperformance in special elections this year.\n\nMore: Matt Van Epps holds off Democratic upset in Tennessee special election\n\nIn five other special elections to fill U.S. House vacancies this year, Democrats overperformed Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris' 2024 election performance by 17 points (Arizona's District 7), 23 points (Florida's District 1), 16 points (Florida's District 6), 28 points (Texas's District 18), and 17 points (Virginia's District 11).\n\nRepublicans have publicly downplayed the shift in Tennessee, arguing the outcome wasn't as close as some polls suggested. But the larger trend is a troubling sign for Republicans as they look to hold on to their current 219-213 House majority in 2026.\n\nAt the same time, Democrats are growing more convinced a double-digit swing in the electorate nationally can put into play a Democratic takeover of the Senate, where Republicans hold a 53-47 seat majority.\n\nWhich way will Senate swing in 2026? Here are 11 pivotal races that will decide.\n\nTrump, GOP rescue mission worked\n\nFor Van Epps to limit Democrats' swing to 13 points, it took Trump injecting himself directly into the race − he held multiple tele-town halls for Van Epps ‒ and millions of dollars in outside money led by the Trump-affiliated MAGA Inc. PAC.\n\nThe money bankrolled attack ads painting Behn as a radical liberal to gin up Republicans' turnout.\n\nThose efforts seemed to work. The race ended up matching midterm-level turnout, far exceeding the low vote totals of most special elections. Behn stood to benefit from a lower-turnout race in which Democrats were more energized. But about 180,000 Tennesseans ultimately voted, on par with the nearly 181,000 who voted in the 2022 Tennessee District 7 midterm election easily won by the GOP.\n\nTennessee sends 'warning signs': Is a blue wave headed for Trump, GOP?\n\nBehn appeared to win a majority of the early vote, reflecting a national trend in recent election cycles in which Democrats are more likely to vote early while Republicans wait until Election Day. But Van Epps used a massive Republican turnout on Election Day ‒ boosted by the aggressive last-minute push from Trump, House Speaker Mike Johnson and other national Republicans ‒ to carry him to victory.\n\nRepublican efforts to nationalize the race paid off in Tennessee's deeply conservative District 7, but the same formula is unlikely to work in a swing district where Trump is less popular. Trump's approval rating has dropped nationally to a second-term low 36%, according to a Gallup poll released Nov. 28.\n\nQuality of Democratic candidates debated\n\nRepublicans were able to go on the attack against Behn because the former community organizer and progressive activist provided so much material.\n\nAn active user of social media and online videos, Behn gave Republicans a trail of statements to pounce on to fire up the GOP base.\n\nWith an onslaught of ads, Republicans labeled Behn a \"far-left lunatic\" and the \"AOC of Tennessee\" and seized on her past social media comments questioning whether police should be dissolved, remarks that religion being prominent in the state legislature makes her \"uncomfortable,\" and commenting that both \"men and women\" can give birth.\n\nMore: Tennessee congressional race becomes unlikely test of blue wave\n\nDemocratic voters in October narrowly chose Behn as their nominee over three less polarizing candidates: Bo Mitchell and Vincent Dixie, both state representatives, and Darden Copeland, a Nashville businessman.\n\nSome have argued a more moderate candidate would have performed better against Van Epps. However, the Monday-morning quarterbacking ignores Behn's success in driving up turnout among the Democratic base, particularly in Democratic-stronghold Nashville, where she far outperformed Harris' 2024 performance.\n\nThe debate over candidate quality illustrates a larger dilemma among Democrats on the type of person to field in the 2026 midterms.\n\nBehn did not fit the same centrist profile as Abigail Spanberger in Virginia and Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey, who helped deliver Democrats' strong performance on Nov. 4 with their lopsided, double-digit victories in gubernatorial races.\n\nAt the same time, much of the energy within the party has shifted to the left, as evident by New York Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani's victory on the same election night.\n\nDemocrats will have to work carefully to see which type of Democrat works in each race.\n\nReach Joey Garrison on X @joeygarrison.","url":"https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/12/03/tennessee-special-election-takeaways-analysis/87583683007/","image":"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/03/USAT/87588813007-2249060150.jpg?auto=webp&crop=7807,4392,x0,y406&format=pjpg&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-03 19:27:29","author":"Usa Today","authors":["Usa Today"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.085},{"id":384748108,"title":"‘Utter Bullsh*t’: Josh Shapiro Lashes Out At Kamala Harris Over Memoir Tales","text":"Democratic Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro profanely disputed stories in former Vice President Kamala Harris’ memoir of the 2024 presidential campaign during an interview with The Atlantic published Wednesday.\n\nThen-Vice President Harris bypassed Shapiro in favor of Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz when selecting her running mate for the 2024 presidential campaign in August of that year. Shapiro appeared to get angry as excerpts from the book regarding his meeting with Harris to discuss the vice-presidential slot on the Democratic ticket were read to him by Tim Alberta during the interview. (RELATED: Barack Obama Really Wants You To Believe Mainstream Media Gets It Right)\n\n“She wrote that in her book? That’s complete and utter bullshit.” an agitated Shapiro asked Alberta. “I can tell you that her accounts are just blatant lies.”\n\nPresident Donald Trump defeated Harris in the presidential election, securing the 270 electoral votes necessary to win the presidency early in the morning on Nov. 6, 2024.\n\nHarris faced pressure from left-wing Democrats, including Democratic Rep. Jamaal Bowman of New York, to not select Shapiro, claiming he was too pro-Israel and also over his past support of school choice measures.\n\nHarris’ account painted Shapiro as a potential problem, and she reportedly questioned if she could trust him as her running mate. Harris also claimed that Shapiro peppered the residence manager of the Naval Observatory with questions about acquiring artwork from Pennsylvania artists and the bedroom.\n\n“I did ask a bunch of questions,” Shapiro admitted to Alberta during the interview. “Wouldn’t you ask questions if someone was talking to you about forming a partnership and working together?”\n\nIn the interview, Shapiro also criticized President Barack Obama and 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton for comments he felt insulted Americans who weren’t living on the West Coast or East Coast. (RELATED: ‘Your Culture Sucks’: Left-Wing Writer Attacks White Americans, Brags ‘Brown People’ Are Breeding In Bizarre Rant)\n\n“I think his understanding of the challenges in those communities was real. But I think instead of offering his prescription for how he’d make it better, he insulted the very folks who were suffering,” Shapiro said of Obama’s comments, noting that both Obama’s comments about how some “cling to guns or religion or antipathy toward people who aren’t like them, or anti-immigrant sentiment” were made during a fundraiser in San Francisco, while Clinton’s “basket of deplorables” comment came at a New York fundraiser.\n\n“We can’t ignore the fact that elections are binary choices. And so you’re asking people, at least in the last case, to choose between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump,” Shapiro told Alberta. “We can have this kind of theoretical conversation about Trump, but, like, it was always Trump versus somebody.”\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Leftist activists have been marching on college campuses, in streets, and at federal buildings, screaming their support for “martyrs” (i.e., terrorists), “intifada” (i.e., genocidal jihad), and more.

If there is one thing we have seen clearly all this year, it is a surge in leftist domestic terrorism right here in the United States. Even the Center for Strategic and International Studies reluctantly admitted the rise in leftist violence. From the BLM/Antifa summer of love and mostly peaceful protests to the 1,153% surge in attacks on ICE officers this year, from the assassination attempts on Donald Trump to the assassination of Charlie Kirk, leftist violence is out of control.\n\nThe latest terrorist attack was a serial criminal who hurled Molotov cocktails into a federal building in Los Angeles on Tuesday while screaming his desire to do violence to ICE officers.

Six House special elections have taken place so far in 2025, including two Florida contests prompted by departures to President Donald Trump’s administration and four others triggered by lawmakers’ deaths.\n\nDemocrats swept the year’s two off-cycle gubernatorial contests, winning the governorships in Virginia and New Jersey, and New York City voters elected democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani as mayor. However, Democrats fell short in several House special elections, even as they narrowed GOP margins.\n\nNPR reported in November that Democrats have overperformed previous margins by an average of about 14 points in special elections this year. In some races, they have also run ahead of Trump’s 2024 showing in the same districts.\n\nTennessee 7th Congressional District\n\nRepublican Matt Van Epps defeated Democrat Aftyn Behn on Tuesday in a district President Donald Trump carried easily in each of his three presidential runs. Trump won the 7th District by about 22 points in 2024, but Behn narrowed that gap this year, losing by roughly 9 points, an overperformance of about 13 points for Democrats despite falling short.\n\nDemocratic candidate State Rep. Aftyn Behn, D-Nashville, speaks to supporters at a watch party after losing a special election for the U.S. seventh congressional district, Tuesday, Dec. 2, 2025, in Nashville, Tenn. \n\nVirginia Gubernatorial Race\n\nTrump lost Virginia to Democrat Kamala Harris by about 5.8 percentage points in 2024. In November, Democrat Abigail Spanberger won the governor’s race by roughly 15 points.\n\nNew Jersey Gubernatorial Race\n\nThe president also lost New Jersey in 2024 by about 5.9 points. However, Democrat Mikie Sherrill widened that gap in November, beating Republican and Trump-endorsed candidate Jack Ciattarelli by about 14.4 points.\n\nFlorida 1st Congressional District\n\nTrump won Florida’s 1st Congressional District by roughly 38 points in 2024, but Republican Jimmy Patronis prevailed in this year’s special election by about 14.6 points over Democrat Gay Valimont. The tighter result shows Democrats cutting into a GOP stronghold even as Republicans kept the seat.\n\nFlorida 6th Congressional District\n\nIn a similar vein, Trump won the 6th district by about 30 points in 2024, and this April, Republican Randy Fine beat Democrat Josh Weil by about 14 points, another example of Democrats not securing the seat but closing the margins.\n\nNew York State Senate District 22 Special Election\n\nDemocrats’ strongest overperformance comes from New York’s 22nd Senate district, where Democrat Sam Sutton won by 35 points in a May special election. Trump carried the seat by 55 points in November 2024, making for a 90-point overperformance. The district is located in South Brooklyn and includes Orthodox Jewish communities. While Trump has performed well there, it has been more open to Democrats down ballot.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, former first lady Melania Trump, and their family celebrate during the balloon drop in the Fiserv Forum on the last night of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wis., on Thursday, July 18, 2024.

Jamie Raskin (D-MD), the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, sent a letter to CBS News on Wednesday claiming President Donald Trump wielded “improper influence” over the editing of his interview with “60 Minutes” last month.\n\nIn the letter to the network’s ombudsman, Kenneth R. Weinstein, Raskin asked him to investigate a “new and stunning intrusion on editorial independence” by Trump after the network aired an edited version of its Nov. 2 interview with him. The aired portion of the interview ran for 28 minutes, while an extended version posted on YouTube ran for 73 minutes — though Trump sat down with correspondent Norah O’Donnell for 90 minutes.\n\n“Trump is now using government power to impose a regime of editorial control and censorship on CBS,” Raskin said in a statement. “He used bogus claims of private bias against Trump at CBS to install a system of public censorship for Trump at CBS. He wants to rule American media the way Putin rules Russian media.”\n\nCBS News and Paramount, its parent company, did not respond to immediate requests for comment. The Hill first reported the letter.\n\nRaskin expressed his concern with how Trump appeared to be “exercising direct control over CBS’s editorial decisions, destroying CBS’s ‘journalistic integrity’ while violating its right to be free from governmental coercion and manipulation,” according to the letter.\n\nThe network received criticism for not airing O’Donnell’s questioning of Trump over his pardoning of Binance crypto exchange founder Changpeng Zhao. Trump said he didn’t know who Zhao was and that his sons were “involved in crypto much more” in crypto after O’Donnell asked about his family’s growing crypto wealth.\n\nRaskin on Wednesday cited Trump’s $20 billion lawsuit against CBS News last year over how it edited a “60 Minutes” interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris, which Paramount settled for $16 million as it sought federal approval from the Federal Communications Commission for its merger with David Ellison’s Skydance. Ellison promised the network would appoint an ombudsman upon the merger’s approval, while “60 Minutes” promised to release the full transcript of interviews with presidents or presidential candidates.\n\n“And now, it appears President Trump has successfully coerced CBS into corruptly and misleadingly editing his own 60 Minutes interview,” Raskin wrote. “Mr. Weinstein, this is your opportunity to silence your critics and prove that you will stand up for ‘journalistic integrity’ by conducting a thorough and transparent investigation into this new and stunning intrusion on editorial independence.”\n\nRaskin offered examples of Trump asking the network throughout his interview with O’Donnell not to air certain parts of the interview, some of which it did not include in its broadcasts. He asked Weinstein to provide written explanations on what editorial standards he applies when reviewing complaints about CBS News’ content, his assessments of the interview and all “documents, communications, and editorial guidance provided to 60 Minutesproducers regarding the Trump interview,” including any potential communications from Trump, by Dec. 17. Raskin also asked Weinstein to arrange a briefing with the committee on the interview.\n\n“It is one thing for CBS to make independent editorial decisionsprotected by the First Amendment,” Raskin wrote. “It is quite another to make edits at the President’s demand out of fear of retribution. The double standard here undermines public trust and demonstrates how Paramount’s capitulation has compromised CBS News’s independence. The American people deserve to know whether their news is shaped by journalistic judgment or by Donald Trump.”","summary":"House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Jamie Raskin wants to know whether CBS News “is shaped by journalistic judgment or by Donald Trump”\n\n\nThe post House Dem Investigates CBS News’ Editing of ‘60 Minutes’ Trump Interview appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/jamie-raskin-democrat-trump-60-minutes-cbs-editing-investigation/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/cbspic.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-03 16:46:57","author":"Corbin Bolies","authors":["Corbin Bolies"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.158},{"id":384680584,"title":"Olivia Nuzzi breaks down in tears when grilled about withholding damaging RFK Jr. secrets: ‘I was afraid’","text":"Former political journalist Olivia Nuzzi burst into tears while trying to defend her decision to withhold dirt on Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., claiming she was “terrified” of her ex-fiance, onetime Politico scribe Ryan Lizza.\n\nThe Bulwark’s Tim Miller grilled Nuzzi, 32, over why she didn’t share information she knew about Kennedy, 71, during his brutal confirmation process and pressed her on whether she still loved the Trump Cabinet member.\n\n“I don’t know how to responsibly handle this on camera,” Nuzzi said after stammering a bit. “I’m writing in that scene that you’re talking about — about how I felt privately.”\n\nIn her new book, “American Canto,” Nuzzi described being in love with Kennedy, whom she described only as “the Politician.” But Miller noted that Nuzzi also fessed up to taking steps to aid the Kennedy scion, whom he argued is now doing “bad things” in his powerful position.\n\n“I lost my job. I was fired and I was in hiding and I was afraid,” Nuzzi insisted calmly before growing emotional. “I was terrified of the man I did not marry [Lizza] and I was very worried about people knowing where I was.”\n\nThe Vanity Fair West Coast editor then wept and pleaded for a pause in the interview before apologizing to a visibly uncomfortable Miller.\n\n“A lot of my whole, the last year was just, you know, my whole life was destabilized,” she reflected after returning from the break.\n\nAmong the revelations about Kennedy that Nuzzi discusses in the book is his use of the powerful hallucinogen Dimethyltryptamine (DMT).\n\n“He was telling me privately that, in fact, he was not sober and he was hiding it not just from the public, but from his own wife,” Nuzzi claimed, noting that she “can only tell you so much” because she wasn’t administering the drugs.\n\nKennedy has declined to publicly comment on the scandal — though his wife, actress Cheryl Hines, has privately bashed Nuzzi as a “f—ing liar,” The Post previously reported.\n\nNuzzi had been a star political reporter at New York magazine, but her reputation went up in flames after the outlet fired her last year following its discovery of the sordid digital tryst with Kennedy.\n\nAnticipating “American Canto,” Lizza, 51, has published a multi-part tell-all on his Telos News substack, claiming that Nuzzi flouted journalism ethics by acting as an unofficial adviser to Kennedy’s abortive independent campaign for the presidency in 2024.\n\n“I had f—ed up, right? I did something wrong. Like, those ethics rules exist for a reason. They’re really good rules. And I had violated that,” Nuzzi reflected.\n\n“When he [Kennedy] would ask my opinion or ask for advice, my approach was Socratic,” she claimed. “And any time I gave prescriptive advice, he never took it.”\n\nNuzzi also lashed out at Lizza, who is now dating a former staffer for former Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign, Caroline Motley.\n\nMotley, 28, is a hardcore pro-choice activist who has described herself as a man-hating “misandrist.” She’s also nearly a quarter-century younger than Lizza.\n\n“He has presented his harassment of me, and this humiliation campaign, as some sort of crusade that’s in the public interest — that somehow the country will be saved by him writing some combination of like fan fiction and revenge porn,” Nuzzi raged about her ex-fiance, whose writing she compared to a “suicide bomber’s manifesto.”\n\n“The only responsible way for him to handle that information as a journalist, he would know this, would be to quietly pass it off to an organization that doesn’t have his conflicts,” she added. “Because his conflicts make it so that — that information could be readily dismissed.”\n\nHowever, Nuzzi similarly felt comfortable waiting to dish about her experiences with Kennedy until the publication of her book, rather than passing that information off to another reporter.\n\n“I got very upset at a certain point when they sent the books to print. It occurred to me just how serious it is to kill so many trees to print your book,” she recalled. \n\n“I took that really seriously, and it’s not an effort to brand myself in any particular way.”","summary":"Drama-courting editor Olivia Nuzzi burst into tears while trying to defend her decision to withhold dirt on Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

Mike Rogers will right the ship and get Michigan working again.”\n\nFormer Representative Mike Rogers, a Republican from Michigan and State Senate candidate, on August 20, 2024, in Howell, Michigan.\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nMichigan is an important swing state. In 2016, U.S. President Donald Trump took it, but former President Joe Biden flipped it back to blue in 2020. Then, in 2024, Trump retook the state by a whisker, winning 49.7 percent of the vote to former Vice President Kamala Harris’ 48.3 percent.\n\nIn the November 2026 midterms, Republicans are looking to retain control of both houses in Congress, so every seat in the Senate matters. There, they currently have 53 seats to the Democrats’ 47, so if they lose just a few seats it will be more difficult for the Trump administration to push through its agenda.\n\nWhat To Know\n\nThree Democrats are running in the primary. These are U.S. Representative Haley Stevens, State Senator Mallory McMorrow and progressive candidate Abdul El-Sayed.\n\nAccording to the Mitchell Research & Communications poll, if Rogers was put up against El-Sayed, he would win with 41 percent of the vote to El-Sayed’s 38 percent. If McMorrow was his opponent, he would win with 44 percent to 38 percent. And if he was pit against Stevens, he would win by 2 percentage points—with 42 percent of the vote share to 40 percent.\n\nThe poll of 616 people was conducted between November 18 and 21 and had a margin of error of 3.7 percentage points.\n\nPrevious poling suggested Rogers was narrowly behind Stevens and McMorrow. A November poll, conducted by EPIC-MRA and originally published in the Detroit Free Press, showed Stevens, who represents an Oakland County-based district composed of Detroit suburbs, leading Rogers by 2 percentage points (44-42). Meanwhile McMorrow, who holds a suburban seat in the state Senate, held a 1-point lead over Rogers (43-42). \n\nThe poll surveyed 600 Michigan residents from November 6-11 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.\n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\nA spokesperson for State Senator Mallory McMorrow previously told Newsweek that polls show she “has the momentum in the primary and is the only candidate who beats Rogers in the general [election].”\n\nJoetta Appiah, a spokesperson for Haley Stevens’ campaign, in a statement: “This is the latest poll confirming that Haley Stevens is the strongest candidate to defeat Mike Rogers and keep Michigan’s must-win Senate seat blue. While Mike Rogers wants to rubber-stamp Trump’s price-hiking, chaos agenda, Haley Stevens is focused on lowering costs, shaping the future of Michigan’s manufacturing economy, and building a wide coalition of support on the ground.”\n\nWhat Happens Next\n\nMichigan’s primary will be held in August 2026 and the general election will take place in November 2026.","summary":"New polling suggests Republican Senate candidate Mike Rogers is likely to win the upcoming general election in Michigan.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/republicans-michigan-senate-mike-rogers-midterm-election-11149037","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2166912067.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-03 16:31:57","author":"Kate Plummer","authors":["Kate Plummer"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.422},{"id":384677942,"title":"Tim Walz called out by Washington Post for refusing to take responsibility for Minnesota fraud scandal","text":"Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz isn't \"helping himself by refusing to take responsibility\" for the welfare fraud that occurred in \"plain sight\" during the COVID-19 pandemic in his state, The Washington Post editorial board wrote Wednesday. The Justice Department announced new charges last week against the 78th defendant in the Feeding Our Future fraud scheme, which prosecutors say involved more than $250 million in stolen funds from a federally funded child nutrition program and has already resulted in over 50 convictions. Many of those charged come from Minnesota’s Somali community. \"The governor is not helping himself by refusing to take responsibility for the welfare fraud that happened in plain sight during the pandemic. Residents, mostly of Somali descent, targeted established Medicaid programs. They opened fake food distribution centers and autism centers to funnel resources away from the neediest. The numbers alone made clear what was happening,\" the editors wrote. \"Autism centers in Minnesota grew by 700 percent between 2018 and 2023 once it became clear how much welfare money was available for the taking. Funding increased by 3,000 percent, from $6 million to almost $192 million. No reasonable person could possibly believe this money was addressing a real surge in autism, yet attempts to flag strange trends went unanswered,\" they continued. ABC, NBC, CBS EVENING NEWSCASTS IGNORE WIDENING MINNESOTA FRAUD CASE ON TIM WALZ'S WATCH The editorial board pointed to Walz's appearance on \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday, when he was pressed on whether he wanted to take responsibility for failing to stop fraud in his state. \"Well, certainly I take responsibility for putting people in jail. Governors don’t get to just talk theoretically. We have to solve problems and I will note, it’s not just Somalis. Minnesota is a generous state, Minnesota is a prosperous state, a well-run state, we are AAA bond-rated, but that attracts criminals. Those people are going to jail, and we are doing everything we can, but to demonize an entire community on the actions of a few, it's lazy,\" Walz responded. They argued that those charged with fraud had their sights \"set on the state’s vast and unaccountable welfare programs: European-style entitlements that turned out to be shockingly easy to scam.\" The editorial board used the word \"lazy\" to describe Walz's response and compared it to President Donald Trump claiming that the \"good parts\" of the economy were his doing, before blaming the bad parts on former President Joe Biden, during a \"Meet the Press\" interview earlier this year. MINNESOTA TAXPAYER DOLLARS FUNNELED TO AL-SHABAAB TERROR GROUP, REPORT ALLEGES \"But it is also lazy to sing the praises of Minnesota’s famously generous welfare state when its merits, and its resources, are evaporating. Walz signed anti-fraud legislation at the start of this year in an attempt to weed out abuses of the system more effectively, but he has also overseen a vast expansion of the welfare state during his tenure, without implementing robust safeguards and checks to be sure the money is fairly distributed,\" the board wrote. The editors also criticized Trump's response to the fraud, which included the president calling Walz \"retarded\" in a Truth Social post. They called Trump's move to end deportation protections for Somalis in Minnesota \"morally bankrupt.\" The editorial board noted that former Vice President Kamala Harris only carried Minnesota in the 2024 election by four points, despite having Walz on the ticket.

Republicans will need to defend much more vulnerable seats if they have any hope of keeping their House majority, while Democrats are capitalizing on President Donald Trump’s unpopularity and the public’s persistent frustration with the economy.\n\n“This is one of the biggest flashing red light warning signs we’ve seen yet for Republicans,” Matt Whitlock, a Republican strategist, wrote on social media. If there were similar numbers across the country next year, “we would be looking at a blue wave far worse than 2018.”\n\nRepublican Matt Van Epps, a military veteran and former state general services commissioner, defeated Democratic state Rep. Aftyn Behn by 9 percentage points on Tuesday for the seat vacated by Republican Mark Green, who retired over the summer. Green had won reelection in 2024 by 21 percentage points.\n\nSpecial elections provide a limited window into the mood of voters and take place under far different conditions than regular campaign cycles. But some Republicans are acknowledging the warning signs, especially after Democrats had convincing victories in New Jersey, Virginia and elsewhere last month. \n\nTennessee was the fifth House special election this year, and Democratic candidates have outperformed Kamala Harris’ showing in the 2024 presidential race by an average of 16 percentage points in the same districts. \n\n“We could have lost this district,” U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, told Fox News after The Associated Press called the race for Van Epps. Cruz said his party must “set out the alarm bells” because next year is “going to be a turnout election and the left will show up.”\n\nTrump dismisses affordability concerns\n\nAlthough inflation has dropped since Democrat President Joe Biden was in office, Behn focused her campaign on the lingering concerns about prices.\n\nTrump has played down the affordability the issue, saying during a Cabinet meeting Tuesday that it was “a con job” by his political opponents.\n\n“There’s this fake narrative that the Democrats talk about, affordability,” he said. “They just say the word. It doesn’t mean anything to anybody, they just say it.”\n\nMaintaining House control is crucial for Trump, who fears a repeat of his first term, when Democrats flipped the House and launched an impeachment inquiry. The Republican president has been leaning on GOP-led states to redraw congressional maps to improve the party’s chances. \n\nTrump campaigned for Van Epps, boosting him during the primary with an endorsement and participating in two tele-rallies during the general election. \n\nThe Republican National Committee also deployed staffers and partnered with state officials to get voters to the polls. MAGA Inc., the super political action committee that had gone dark since supporting Trump in 2024, reemerged to back Van Epps with about $1.7 million. \n\nU.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., visited the Nashville-area district on Monday.\n\n“When you’re in a deep red district, sometimes people assume that the Republican, the conservative will win,” he said Tuesday. “And you cannot assume that, because anything can happen.”\n\nChip Saltsman, a political strategist and former Tennessee Republican Party chair, said his party had brought in its heaviest hitters simply because there were not other competing contests, not because Republicans feared a loss.\n\n“It’s the only election going on. Why wouldn’t the speaker come?” he asked. “There was one race. and you would expect everybody to do everything they could.”\n\nDemocrats see promise despite loss\n\nThe House Majority PAC put $1 million behind Behn. After she lost, Democratic national party chair said Behn’s performance was “a flashing warning sign for Republicans heading into the midterms” in 2026.\n\nBehn said her campaign had “inspired an entire country.” \n\n“Let’s keep going,” she urged voters after her loss. “We’re not done. Not now, not ever.”\n\nAlthough Democrats were optimistic, the result contributed to some murmuring within the party about the best path forward as it grasps for a path back to power in Washington.\n\nAmong special elections this year, the shift in Behn’s direction was the second smallest, providing an opening for some factions that believe more moderate candidates would fare better. \n\n“Each time we nominate a far-left candidate in a swing district who declares themselves to be radical and alienates the voters in the middle who deliver majorities, we set back that cause,” said a statement from Lanae Erickson, a senior vice president at Third Way, a centrist Democrat think tank.\n\nRepublicans tried to turn Behn’s own words against her in television ads, such as when she described herself as a “radical” or claimed to be “bullying” immigration agents and state police officers. Also cited were comments Behn made about Nashville years ago, when she said, “I hate this city,” and complained about bachelorette parties.\n\nSeveral high-profile progressive leaders, including U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., had rallied for Behn in the campaign’s final days. \n\nAssociated Press writer Maya Sweedler contributed to this report.","url":"https://apnews.com/article/epps-behn-tennessee-republicans-midterms-2026-congress-2d84f7497f32cbd167a2b0ec9f8d4b81","image":"https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/3026036/2147483647/strip/false/crop/7018x4679+0+0/resize/1486x991!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F81%2F49%2Fa3dc2223021fc76667057380fbf1%2F4bbbd3319033462fb4ab956ada8dafdb","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-03 15:29:46","author":"Joey Cappelletti,Meg Kinnard","authors":["Joey Cappelletti","Meg Kinnard"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.467},{"id":384698972,"title":"Nolte: New York Times Debunks Washington Post’s Pathetic ‘Kill Everybody' Hoax","text":"The far-left Washington Post published another in a long line of shameless and desperate hoaxes last week, this one aimed at Secretary of War Pete Hegseth, only to have it debunked by the far-left New York Times (and reality).\n\nUsed to be the fake media would cover for the fake media. That’s because they were all in the same sleazy, left-wing club. But now that Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos has announced some drastic moves towards sanity and common sense on his editorial page, the protection racket is over. The Post is now seen as an apostate, which means it must be destroyed. No longer being in The Club means the protection racket is over, and outlets like the Times will pounce when given the chance.\n\nWhile the Times’ motivation for humiliating the Post is purely mercenary and political, in the aggregate, this is a good thing. Regardless of motive, you want news outlets to fact-check other news outlets.\n\nWe need more of this as opposed to what we’ve had for the last 20 years, which is a media omertà based on a shared desire to aid and abet Democrats at all costs.\n\nOn September 2, the American military did what it should be doing: killed terrorists. In this case, narcoterrorists from Venezuela are looking to import into the U.S. population a poison called fentanyl that kills more than 100,000 of us each year.\n\nTwo strikes were apparently necessary to stop these terrorists, and the disgraced Post, citing the usual-usual anonymous sources-that-tell-the-fake-media-what-the-fake-media-want-to-hear-so-the-fake-media-can-publish-fake-news, published a laughably fake story (in an effort to stop the spread of disinformation, I do not link fake news) that had Hegseth shouting like a Bond villain: “Kill everybody!”\n\nFor minutes, commanders watched the boat burning on a live drone feed. As the smoke cleared, they got a jolt: Two survivors were clinging to the smoldering wreck.\nThe Special Operations commander overseeing the Sept. 2 attack — the opening salvo in the Trump administration’s war on suspected drug traffickers in the Western Hemisphere — ordered a second strike to comply with Hegseth’s instructions, two people familiar with the matter said. The two men were blown apart in the water.\n\nOh, and the timing of this hoax! What perfect timing! How perfect (for Democrats, naturally)! Just days, mere days, only days after the release of the Seditious Six video, the Post learns (from the usual-usual anonymous sources-that-tell-the-fake-media-what-the-fake-media-want-to-hear-so-the-fake-media-can-publish-fake-news) that there have indeed been illegal orders given—war crimes, in fact!\n\nThe Russia Collusion Hoax, of which the Post was the worst offender, not named CNN, at least had some finesse, style, and planning to it. As evil and un-American as that hoax was, you have to admire the subtlety and intricate planning that went into it.\n\nBut this…? The Kill Everybody Hoax…? You can smell the ham hands, feel the greasy sweat, sense the hurried desperation, and laugh at the fumbled execution.\n\nOkay, here’s the plan: Trump’s kicking our ass all over the place, so we six will release a video warning the military not to follow illegal orders. Then you guys publish an article proving the military is issuing illegal orders—don’t worry, we’ll get you plenty of the usual-usual anonymous sources-that-tell-the-fake-media-what-the-fake-media-want-to-hear-so-the-fake-media-can-publish-fake-news.

If he could grow a mustache, he’d twist it.\n\nIt’s all so dumb, the New York Times debunked it…\n\nHeadline: “Hegseth Ordered a Lethal Attack but Not the Killing of Survivors, Officials Say”\n\nBut, each official said, Mr. Hegseth’s directive did not specifically address what should happen if a first missile turned out not to fully accomplish all of those things. And, the officials said, his order was not a response to surveillance footage showing that at least two people on the boat survived the first blast.\nAdmiral Bradley ordered the initial missile strike and then several follow-up strikes that killed the initial survivors and sank the disabled boat. As that operation unfolded, they said, Mr. Hegseth did not give any further orders to him.\n\nHAHAHAHAHA!!!\n\nNaturally, all this fake outrage over the perfectly legal targeting of terrorists is coming from the same fake media that celebrated Barry Obama’s drone striking of American citizens.\n\nAnd so, the hoax list adds a sibling:\n\nThe Hegseth ‘Kill Everybody’ Hoax\nTrump “Destroying” White House Hoax\nPhoto of Starving Gaza Baby Hoax\nIsraeli Troops Murdered Food-Seeking Palestinians Hoax\nTrump Tariffs Will Explode Prices Hoax\nMaryland Man Hoax\nBlack Newborns Much More Likely to Die If Doc’s White Hoax\nElon Musk Nazi Salute Hoax\nMass Hysterectomies Performed on Immigrants Hoax\nThe All-White Trump Party Hoax\nSpringfield Bomb Threat Hoax\nTrump Called for Liz Cheney to Be Executed Hoax\nViolent Crime Down Under Biden/Harris Hoax\nArlington Cemetery Hoax\nKamala Was Never America’s Border Czar Hoax\nRussia Collusion Hoax\nHands Up, Don’t Shoot Hoax\nJussie Smollett Hoax\nCovington KKKids Hoax\nVery Fine People Hoax\nSeven-Hour Gap Hoax\nRussian Bounties Hoax\nTrump Trashes Troops Hoax\nPolicemen Killed at Mostly Peaceful January 6 Protest Hoax\nRittenhouse Hoax\nEating While Black Hoax\nBorder Agents Whipping Illegals Hoax\nNASCAR Noose Hoax\nGeorgia Jim Crow 2.0 Hoax\nTrump Assaulted Secret Service Agents and Grabbed Steering Wheel of Beast Hoax\nMAGA Assaulted Paul Pelosi Hoax\nCOVID Lab Leak Theory Is Racist Hoax\nHunter Biden’s Laptop Is Russian Disinformation Hoax\nJoe Biden Will Never Ban Gas Stoves Hoax\nCOVID Deaths are Overcounted Is a Conspiracy Theory Hoax\nMass Graves of Native Children in Canada Hoax\nTrump Killed Japanese Koi Fish Hoax\nTrump Told People to Drink Bleach Hoax\nHamas Hospital Hoax\nIf Reelected, Trump Will Execute People Hoax\nThe 900,000 Kids Hospitalized with Coronavirus Hoax\nDozens of Environmental Hoaxes\nThe Alfa Bank Hoax\nLibs of TikTok Murdered Non-Binary Teen Hoax\nAaron Rodgers Sandy Hook-Truther Hoax\n‘Bloodbath’ Hoax\nBiden ‘Sharp-as-a-Tack’ Hoax\nIowa Poll Hoax\n\nDemocrats, and this obviously includes the regime media, only care about murderers, child rapists, terrorists, and drug dealers.

In fact, I considered it myself it when I escaped New York City in 2023 before settling on vastly superior West Virginia. There is a high quality of life and low cost of living, and in general Tennessee is just a nice place to live. Democrats understand these demographic changes in red states, and many will now argue that Behn’s success shows that the growth strategy here is to play to the younger, far-left voters, not the Joe Manchin-type, blue-dog Democrats in their 60s who you can find here and there at the VFW. Meanwhile, Republicans have expressed glee at the way President Trump has appealed to young voters in the past, especially young men. Problem is, those gains seem to all but disappear when Trump isn't on the ballot. I'M A YOUNG DEMOCRAT AND I'VE GOT TO ADMIT MY PARTY IS LOSING 2025 WHILE LOOKING AT 2028 Part of this disconnect comes from the fact that much of the economic populism that makes Trump attractive to young male voters, including things like $2,000 tariff rebate checks, are the exact things that more traditional Republicans object to in Trump’s platform. The thing that is almost funny about the way that this special election played out was that the only area of the district that Behn won, and decisively, was Nashville, a city which she famously, and recently, said she hated. This should not be a surprise, one of the key things that far leftists and socialists do is disconnect a place from its roots. This is how you end up with places like Portland, Oregon, putting up a \"Tree\" instead of a \"Christmas Tree.\" AFTYN BEHN DODGES QUESTIONS ON POLICE FUNDING, POLICY DISAGREEMENTS WITH KAMALA HARRIS In her concession speech, Behn said her campaign was the beginning of \"something powerful in Tennessee and across the south.\" She could very well be right, because Nashville is not alone in turning bright blue. Durham, North Carolina, basically has the politics of Brooklyn, and cities like it and Nashville are growing at massively higher rates than the reliably red rural counties that have traditionally kept Dixie conservative.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani and Behn, are all in their 30s. They have time on their side. REPUBLICANS RELENTLESSLY USE MAMDANI AS SOCIALIST CUDGEL TO BASH VULNERABLE DEMOCRATS Like Moses, Bernie Sanders may have gone to the socialist mountaintop, but it is his followers who mean to get to the Marxist promised land. Republicans need to take these warnings seriously. Say what you will about the tenets of socialism, but at least it's an ethos. Right now, nobody seems to know quite what Trumpism is, other than Trump himself. That has to change.

In fact, Trump may need to set not just the priorities of his administration, but of the future of the Grand Old Party. Tennessee was not California’d on Tuesday night, and that is a very good thing, but the trends are not good for Republicans. Democrats have a new identity as socialists, and it turns out not to be disqualifying. So what identity will the GOP choose?

These were usually cut before the final edit, but Trump made it in here and there, most famously in Home Alone 2. Celebrities are rich, good-looking and successful – Trump’s three favourite things. He finds it irresistible. \n\nThe problem for Trump in his latest incarnation, as the endlessly divisive Maga President, then, is that he seems to be in almost constant conflict with some of America’s best-loved celebrities – especially when they happen to be younger women. \n\nThis week, Sabrina Carpenter became the latest star to clash with Trump’s administration, after an official Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) account on X posted a video showing ICE agents rounding up alleged “illegal immigrants” for deportation, set to her song Juno. She condemned the video as “evil and disgusting”, adding “do not ever involve me or my music to benefit your inhumane agenda”. \n\nCarpenter and her team must surely be braced for backlash, as it’s happened many times before. Taylor Swift should, in theory, be a Maga icon – she’s a conventionally attractive white woman, with country music roots, who has turned herself into a billionaire through her talent and business acumen. More than that, she’s engaged to one of the most famous American footballers in the country. \n\nYou simply do not get more appealing to middle America than that – but the usually apolitical Swift endorsed Democrat Kamala Harris in 2024, and spoke out against Trump’s crackdown on abortion rights. That was enough to have Trump posting that “I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT” on more than one occasion, even claiming that after he said that, she became less attractive. \n\nIn May 2025, four months into his second term as US President, the most powerful man in the free world, he posted: “Has anyone noticed that, since I said ‘I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT,’ she’s no longer ‘HOT?’” \n\nBeyoncé has been in line for even harsher criticism, for almost a decade, after appearing at a Clinton rally. This has recently escalated into calls for Beyoncé to be prosecuted alongside Trump’s other enemies, in this case over an exaggerated conspiracy theory that she only endorsed Harris in exchange for a payout of millions (though the campaign did cover costs for her appearance). \n\nTrump has similarly castigated singer Rihanna, after she refused permission for his music to be used at rallies, called Madonna “disgusting” and “disgraceful to our country” for criticising him, and has even attacked the actress Meryl Streep and talk show host Oprah Winfrey – usually so beloved as to be beyond criticism – for not being on his side. \n\nIt is tempting to see a pattern here, especially from a president like Trump, who has been adjudicated by a civil court to have sexually assaulted at least one woman, and who has been accused of sexually harassing many more. Trump’s twisted attitudes towards women surely fuel some of his anger – as evidenced by his notorious “bleeding from her…” comments about Megyn Kelly, then of Fox News, after she asked him challenging questions at a TV debate. \n\nBut there is something more going on – Trump has managed to fight with numerous male music stars, too, including several he clearly regarded as his heroes, or hoped might be his buddies. \n\nTrump’s ongoing feud with Bruce Springsteen over the use of Born in the USA – surely second only to The Police’s I’ll Be Watching You as the world’s most misunderstood track – is perhaps his most notable, leading Springsteen to break with much of his fanbase and openly oppose Trump. \n\nBut he has managed to be in dispute with Aerosmith, REM, Neil Young, Creedence Clearwater Revival and even Kenny Loggins over use of music. Trump is at war with the authors of half of America’s classic rock playlist. \n\nThe reality of Trump’s life is that he is surrounded by sycophants, who only tell him how brilliant he is, how great his ideas are and how universally beloved he is by anyone who matters. He has set things up so they work that way, and made sure nothing else gets in.\n\nCelebrities, bizarrely, are the one set of people who break that bubble – people he’s aware of, and is sure must think he’s as great as everyone else does, only for them to let him down again, and again and again.\n\nTrump’s allies pass this off as an out-of-touch liberal Hollywood elite, and their base will surely lap that up. The reality, though, is even stranger. The public disdain of America’s A-listers is Trump’s only contact with how he’s seen in the real world. No wonder he hates it so.","url":"https://inews.co.uk/news/world/megastars-sabrina-carpenter-loathe-trump-kills-him-4083473","image":"https://inews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/SEI_263772186.jpg?crop=0px%2C98px%2C952px%2C538px&resize=1200%2C675","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-03 14:47:51","author":"James Ball","authors":["James Ball"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.038},{"id":384671562,"title":"Republican victory in Tennessee special election fails to dispel 2026 midterm concerns (World)","text":"Republicans held onto a reliably conservative U.S. House district in Tennessee's special election, but only after a late burst of national spending and high-profile campaigning helped them secure a margin less than half of last year’s race.\n\nEven with that victory, the outcome contributed to a gloomy outlook for the party going into the 2026 contests that will determine control of Congress. Republicans will need to defend much more vulnerable seats if they have any hope of keeping their House majority, while Democrats are capitalizing on President Donald Trump’s unpopularity and the public's persistent frustration with the economy.\n\n“This is one of the biggest flashing red light warning signs we’ve seen yet for Republicans,” Matt Whitlock, a Republican strategist, wrote on social media. If there were similar numbers across the country next year, “we would be looking at a blue wave far worse than 2018.\"\n\nRepublican Matt Van Epps, a military veteran and former state general services commissioner, defeated Democratic state Rep. Aftyn Behn by 9 percentage points on Tuesday for the seat vacated by Republican Mark Green, who retired over the summer. Green had won reelection in 2024 by 21 percentage points.\n\nSpecial elections provide a limited window into the mood of voters and take place under far different conditions than regular campaign cycles. But some Republicans are acknowledging the warning signs, especially after Democrats had convincing victories in New Jersey, Virginia and elsewhere last month.\n\nTennessee was the fifth House special election this year, and Democratic candidates have outperformed Kamala Harris’ showing in the 2024 presidential race by an average of 16 percentage points in the same districts.\n\n“We could have lost this district,” U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, told Fox News after The Associated Press called the race for Van Epps. Cruz said his party must “set out the alarm bells” because next year is \"going to be a turnout election and the left will show up.”\n\nTrump dismisses affordability concerns\n\nAlthough inflation has dropped since Democrat President Joe Biden was in office, Behn focused her campaign on the lingering concerns about prices.\n\nTrump has played down the affordability the issue, saying during a Cabinet meeting Tuesday that it was “a con job” by his political opponents.\n\n“There's this fake narrative that the Democrats talk about, affordability,\" he said. \"They just say the word. It doesn't mean anything to anybody, they just say it.”\n\nMaintaining House control is crucial for Trump, who fears a repeat of his first term, when Democrats flipped the House and launched an impeachment inquiry. The Republican president has been leaning on GOP-led states to redraw congressional maps to improve the party's chances.\n\nTrump campaigned for Van Epps, boosting him during the primary with an endorsement and participating in two tele-rallies during the general election.\n\nThe Republican National Committee also deployed staffers and partnered with state officials to get voters to the polls. MAGA Inc., the super political action committee that had gone dark since supporting Trump in 2024, reemerged to back Van Epps with about $1.7 million.\n\nU.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., visited the Nashville-area district on Monday.\n\n“When you’re in a deep red district, sometimes people assume that the Republican, the conservative will win,\" he said Tuesday. \"And you cannot assume that, because anything can happen.\"\n\nChip Saltsman, a political strategist and former Tennessee Republican Party chair, said his party had brought in its heaviest hitters simply because there were not other competing contests, not because Republicans feared a loss.\n\n“It’s the only election going on. Why wouldn’t the speaker come?” he asked. “There was one race. and you would expect everybody to do everything they could.”\n\nDemocrats see promise despite loss\n\nThe House Majority PAC put $1 million behind Behn. After she lost, Democratic national party chair said Behn's performance was “a flashing warning sign for Republicans heading into the midterms” in 2026.\n\nBehn said her campaign had “inspired an entire country.”\n\n“Let’s keep going,\" she urged voters after her loss. \"We’re not done. Not now, not ever.\"\n\nAlthough Democrats were optimistic, the result contributed to some murmuring within the party about the best path forward as it grasps for a path back to power in Washington.\n\nAmong special elections this year, the shift in Behn's direction was the second smallest, providing an opening for some factions that believe more moderate candidates would fare better.\n\n“Each time we nominate a far-left candidate in a swing district who declares themselves to be radical and alienates the voters in the middle who deliver majorities, we set back that cause,” said a statement from Lanae Erickson, a senior vice president at Third Way, a centrist Democrat think tank.\n\nRepublicans tried to turn Behn’s own words against her in television ads, such as when she described herself as a “radical” or claimed to be “bullying” immigration agents and state police officers. Also cited were comments Behn made about Nashville years ago, when she said, “I hate this city,” and complained about bachelorette parties.\n\nSeveral high-profile progressive leaders, including U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., had rallied for Behn in the campaign's final days.","summary":"Republicans held onto a reliably conservative U.S. House district in Tennessee&#39;s special election, but only after a late burst of national spending and high-profile campaigning helped them secure a margin less than half of last year&rsquo;s race.\n\nEven with that victory, the outcome contribute...","url":"https://www.castanet.net/news/World/587364/Republican-victory-in-Tennessee-special-election-fails-to-dispel-2026-midterm-concerns","image":"https://www.castanet.net/content/2025/12/8de9f3df789d310da0917165b5de58e252458f25261635eefd618345fa71869b.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-03 14:46:00","author":"Republican Mark Green","authors":["Republican Mark Green"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.467},{"id":384639138,"title":"Crowborough's Nightmare: 600 New Illegal Migrants Dumped in Historic Camp","text":"The illegal immigration picture here in the United States has changed dramatically in the last 11 months. Since President Trump resumed office, the borders have been closed, and illegal aliens are being repatriated. As many as a million or more have left voluntarily, with the understanding they can return through the legal process.\n\nThis is why elections matter. Because, once again, the United Kingdom is presenting us with a vivid example of what happens when the government takes the opposite approach. In a sleepy little British town called Crowborough, 600 illegal aliens are about to be dumped into a World War 2-era camp, and the locals are not happy about it.\n\nLast Sunday as a wintry sun beamed through the trees bordering the driveway down to Crowborough army camp, a rapidly growing mass of people gathered, chatting, smiling and relaxed – a mass which would eventually form into a wide phalanx of up to 4,000 people who would march through the centre of their small leafy town. This was the fourth successive protest against the placement of up to 600 men who had entered the country by illegal means into the heart of Crowborough’s community. As with the three previous marches, the protest was orderly, amiable and overwhelmingly comprised of local residents. Such is the growing public and media interest in Crowborough’s fight that even Australia’s Financial Review carried a piece designating the town as “ground zero in Britain’s immigration row”.\n\nIt's good to see the British people are fighting back, but their government seems to be ignoring their concerns, and that's baffling. It's hard - nay, impossible to see what possible gain the United Kingdom could realize by importing these people.\n\nAs things stand, the Home Office has indicated that it is “continuing to accelerate plans to move people into Crowborough” but would not do so until “the sites are fully operational and safe”.So it is delaying whilst accelerating – in other words, prevaricating and procrastinating – and whatever the reasons for the delay, it is reasonable to assume that those reasons are not connected to the safety of the residents of Crowborough or of the nearby towns of Tunbridge Wells and Uckfield, to which the migrants will be regularly bussed.\n\nIn other words, the Home Office is basically thumbing its nose at the concerns of the British taxpayers.\n\nRead More: Win for Free Speech in Britain: Criticism of Islam Protected Speech\n\nAs for the illegal aliens themselves, to anyone who remembers the years from 2021-2025, well, this has a familiar ring to it:\n\nIf and when they arrive, the men will be from a range of different countries, cultures and religions. The authorities will not be clear about those details, they may not know themselves, but the local people will be even more in the dark. Locals do however know that their new neighbours have not travelled here by a normal route, but rather have come by stealth, by illegal means.\n\nIn other words, this is an influx of 600 unscreened, unvetted, unknown aliens who entered the UK illegally, and who now will be housed and fed at taxpayer expense.\n\nThe British taxpayers and the people of Crowborough have every reason to be upset. But here, on our side of the Atlantic, we can only look at this as an object lesson, an illustration as to the importance of elections. If (fates forfend) Kamala Harris had won the 2024 election, we would be seeing this here, now, in the United States. If Democrats manage to wrest control of Congress from the GOP in 2026, we will see the new majority trying every trick in the book to scupper the Trump administration's efforts to get illegal immigration under control.\n\nThe midterms will be here before we know it. Pay attention to what's happening in the UK and the rest of Europe, where illegal immigration is concerned, because this is what Democrats want to do here.\n\nEditor’s Note: Thanks to President Trump, illegal immigration into our great country has virtually stopped. Despite the radical left's lies, new legislation wasn't needed to secure our border, just a new president.\n\nHelp us continue to report the truth about the president's border policies and mass deportations.

But a year after a catastrophic defeat in the 2024 presidential election, Democrats were happy to take a moral victory on Tuesday night in a Tennessee special election.\n\nIn a deep red district that Trump had won by more than 20 points in 2024, Democratic state representative Aftyn Behn dramatically closed the gap into the high single digits. With over 95 percent of precincts reporting, Republican Matt Van Epps had won a 54 percent to 45 percent victory over the Democratic candidate, who had become a progressive darling and right wing bugbear in recent weeks.\n\nThe race was a bellweather for 2026, and Democrats hailed the result. They had turned a safe seat into a competitive one, suggesting a wide open battlefield next year where not only would the House be in reach, but the U.S. Senate as well.\n\nRepublicans took their own victory lap. “No matter what the D.C. insiders or liberal media say, this is President Trump’s party. I’m proud to be a part of it and can’t wait to get to work,” Van Epps said during his victory speech, according to the Associated Press.\n\nAnd on some level, Republicans are correct: Even though this is SEC country, politics isn’t like college football and strength of victory doesn’t matter. But this race was never just about one seat; it was a gauge of each party’s strength heading into 2026. And on that front, Behn’s 9-point loss suggested the party had gained significant ground—given that Trump had beaten Kamala Harris by 22 points here a year ago.\n\nDemocrats would have needed a perfect storm to win a special election in a district like this. Behn was a steadfast progressive with a long history of intemperate online comments that were tailor made for 30-second television ads and Fox News monologues. By the end of the race, Donald Trump was attacking her for allegedly hating both Christianity and country music. Although Behn sang Dolly Parton’s 9 to 5 in a rhinestone studded denim suit before her concession speech, it was probably not a sufficient or a timely rebuttal to the barrage she faced on television in the last weeks of the campaign.\n\nIn contrast, Van Epps, a first-time candidate, didn’t make any unforced errors. A dark haired, clean cut military veteran who put a helicopter on all of his yard signs to emphasize his service, he was the platonic ideal of a generic Republican. He embraced Trump sufficiently to appeal to the base but did not over emphasize the President in television ads, lest it antagonize those swing voters who might be unhappy with the cost of living.\n\nIt also featured turnout far higher than in a typical special election, with the number of ballots cast Tuesday roughly equalling turnout in the 2022 midterms, where there were races up and down the ballot. (The congressional special election was the only contest.)\n\nIn such a deep red district, the heavy turnout would have made it near impossible for any Democratic candidate to claim an election night victory when stalwart conservatives like Anne Campbell of Franklin turned out to vote. “I basically don’t like what the Democrat stands for,” she told Slate. “I believe in prayer. I believe in freedom, which she does not.”\n\nA last minute barrage of television ads and a full day trip from Speaker Mike Johnson helped to raise awareness of the race just enough to activate Republicans to cast a ballot a few days after Thanksgiving.\n\nAs Behn sold her over performance in her concession speech, “they thought they could buy [an] easy double digit [win].” It helped that Republicans emphasized that they needed to win by a significant amount at a rally the day before on a suburban estate. “It’s not just winning but winning by a wide enough margin to send a real Tennessee message” said Bill Lee, the Volunteer State’s governor. While one poll had the race within two point margin, operatives in both parties expected Van Epps to win in the mid to high single digits. He did the latter in what was, at best for the GOP, a mixed Tennessee message.\n\nThe high turnout made it easier for those national Democrats to spin the race as a massive success. It’s easier to claim that this special election will be a harbinger for the midterms when the turnout approaches that which is expected next year.\n\nBut, the crowd at Behn’s election night party seemed mostly unconcerned with the broader national ramifications or reading the tea leaves for how vulnerable it might leave Republicans in seats across the country next year.\n\nEven long after the race was called for Van Epps, people were still dancing and celebrating. Just as they ignored the burning smell in the room from the pop up stand selling $12 hot dogs, they didn’t let the defeat bother them.\n\nAfter all, Democrats in Tennessee had been losers for nearly 20 years. They would take a moral victory tonight.","summary":"It's a loss that suggests much bigger wins could be ahead.","url":"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2025/12/tennessee-special-election-result-aftyn-behn-matt-van-epps.html?via=rss","image":"https://compote.slate.com/images/87f9f108-008f-4668-81ae-2c5cebff52e4.jpeg?crop=7218%2C4812%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-03 13:46:17","author":"Ben Jacobs","authors":["Ben Jacobs"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.142},{"id":384599276,"title":"Trending World","text":"US President Donald Trump has said he does not want Somali immigrants in the US, telling reporters they should \"go back to where they came from\" and \"their country is no good for a reason\".\n\n\"I don't want them in our country, I'll be honest with you,\" he said during a cabinet meeting on Tuesday.

The New York Times first reported the operation.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, declined to comment on planned operations and denied that any people would be targeted based on race.\n\n\"Every day, ICE enforces the laws of the nation across the country,\" said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. \n\n\"What makes someone a target of ICE is not their race or ethnicity, but the fact that they are in the country illegally,\" she said.\n\nIn a news conference, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said that an operation by ICE \"means due process will be violated\".\n\nAccording to local leaders, there are about 80,000 people living there who are originally from Somalia, and the vast majority are American citizens.\n\nLast month, Trump said he planned to end the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) - a programme for immigrants from countries in crisis - for Somali residents living in Minnesota. A few hundred immigrants would be affected by that order. \n\nTPS for Somalis has existed since 1991, resulting from conflict in the nation.\n\nEarlier this week, Trump's Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem suggested her agency would target visa fraud in Minnesota. \n\nAnd his US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also announced an investigation into allegations that tax dollars from the state may have been diverted to the al-Shabab Islamist militant group in Somalia, which is part of al-Qaeda. The probe follows unverified media reports in the US, which have been denied by the militants.\n\nSomalia is one of the poorest nations in the world, and many of the migrants who moved to the US left in the 1990s during the country's decades-long civil war.\n\nThe Somali state minister of foreign affairs, Ali Omar, appeared to hit back at the Trump administration's ongoing narrative on Tuesday. \n\nWithout naming the US president, Omar posted on X to say: \"It has become too easy for some to use Somalia as a scapegoat or distraction from their own failures.\" \n\nMeanwhile, local leaders in Minnesota have directly condemned the Trump administration's reported plan for an ICE operation.\n\nMinnesota state Senator Zaynab Mohamed said on X that \"when ICE agents interact with Somalis here, they will find what we've been saying for years: Almost all of us are US citizens\". \n\nDemocratic Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, who was Kamala Harris's running mate in the 2024 presidential election and who has been sparring with the president in recent days, said: \"We welcome support in investigating and prosecuting crime. But pulling a PR stunt and indiscriminately targeting immigrants is not a real solution to a problem.\"\n\nThe recent broadening of Trump's immigration crackdown comes after National Guard member Sarah Beckstrom, 20, was killed in last week's shooting in Washington DC, and Andrew Wolfe, 24, was seriously injured.\n\nOfficials said the suspect entered the US in 2021 as part of a programme for Afghans who worked with US troops during their 20 years in Afghanistan, and who were considered to be at risk of reprisals after the US withdrew.\n\nOn Tuesday, Noem said she would recommend a travel ban on several countries which she claimed were \"flooding\" the US with criminal activity. \n\nEarlier, all US decisions on asylum requests were halted, and a review was announced into green cards that were issued to individuals who migrated to the US from a number of countries. Trump has also threatened to \"permanently pause migration\" from what he calls \"third world countries\".","url":"https://www.classfmonline.com/world/Trump-says-he-does-not-want-Somalis-in-US-as-ICE-plans-Minnesota-operation-68371","image":"https://cdn.classfmonline.com/imagelib/thumbs/94053802.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-03 13:12:22","author":"Bbc.com","authors":["Bbc.com"],"language":"en","source_country":"gh","sentiment":-0.194},{"id":384641576,"title":"Stella Parton's Dream Ballot Is Actually the Stuff of Nightmares","text":"One of the things that makes country music icon, actress, and philanthropist Dolly Parton a beloved American figure is the fact that we don't really know her politics.

Musk placed the bet during a video appearance at a reunion of his DOGE cost-cutting team last month, saying the U.S. is at the beginning of a \"great 12-year span,\" Politico reported Tuesday. Musk reportedly told attendees that he opted to join the event virtually because news of it was public, and he rated himself among the top assassination targets in the country, behind only Trump and Vance. Attendees at the event had their phones placed in pouches for the duration, and they only got them back when boarding buses leaving the venue. Musk&apos;s relationship with Trump has been rocky after the pair fell out over the passage of the \"Big Beautiful Bill\" earlier this year. Nevertheless, the spat appears to be behind them. TRUMP TEASES MUSK AT FORUM AS ONCE-FROSTY DYNAMIC SEEMS TO TAKE A TURN Trump said Tuesday he still likes Musk \"a lot\" when asked whether Musk was \"back in [his] circle of friends.\" \"Well, I really don&apos;t know. I mean, I like Elon a lot,\" he said during Tuesday&apos;s Cabinet meeting. He praised Musk’s endorsement during the 2024 campaign before noting their disagreement over electric-vehicle policy. Musk was a fixture in the White House in the early days of the second Trump administration, as he took on the role as the Department of Government Efficiency&apos;s de facto leader. He served as a special government employee with the Trump administration to help lead DOGE, frequently attending Cabinet meetings and joining Trump during public events. Musk&apos;s tenure with DOGE wrapped up at the end of May. MUSK ALLY JARED ISAACMAN MAKES COMEBACK BID FOR NASA ADMINISTRATOR ROLE AFTER MAY WITHDRAWAL: REPORT Musk had also championed Trump during the 2024 election cycle, criss-crossing battleground states that ultimately all voted for the Republican candidate over former Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump repeatedly celebrated Musk for his efforts at DOGE to remove potential federal overspending, fraud and mismanagement – an effort assailed by government employees and Democrats who protested both the Trump administration and Musk repeatedly earlier this year. The cozy friendship fell to pieces in June, however, when Musk began publicly ridiculing the \"One Big Beautiful Bill,\" which was a massive piece of legislation Trump signed into law in July that advances his agenda on taxes, immigration, energy, defense and the national debt. TRUMP&apos;S MAIN DOGE OFFICE SHUTTERS — BUT ITS WAR ON GOVERNMENT WASTE ISN&apos;T OVER Musk railed against the legislation, which Trump had been rallying Republican lawmakers to pass since the beginning of his second term, posting on X that it would be the \"BIGGEST DEBT ceiling increase in HISTORY,\" and also claiming in a personal attack on Trump that \"@RealDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files.\" Trump previously told the media that his relationship with Musk changed when he began discussing plans to eliminate the electric vehicle mandate, which would affect Musk&apos;s signature company, Tesla. Trump signed a trio of congressional resolutions in June ending California&apos;s restrictive rules for diesel engines and mandates on electric vehicle sales, celebrating that his signature \"will kill the California mandates forever.\" The pair abruptly parted ways in June, with Musk weeks later offering some support to Trump&apos;s presidential actions on social media, such as praising a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas in July.

Her name was Sarah Beckstrom, and there are all kinds of powerful people who want you to forget about her.\n\nThey don’t want an investigation into why her Islamic extremist murderer and hundreds of thousands like him are in the United States. They don’t want anybody to reach any conclusions about radical Islam and actually do something that might upset their secular globalist agenda.\n\nThe Democrat Party wants to move on from Sarah as quickly as possible. But they are interested in somebody who has been killed, but it’s not Sarah Beckstrom, a brave American heroine.\n\nNo, Democrats are angry because two foreign drug traffickers whose names we don’t know were killed while attempting to bring another boatload of their poison into the United States.\n\nDemocrats are claiming this was a war crime because the boat was hit twice and there were no survivors. In military parlance, it was a “double tap,” or firing two shots in quick succession to guarantee a successful hit.\n\nDemocrats and their left-wing media allies are running around with their hair on fire, demanding emergency hearings on Capitol Hill. They want Pete Hegseth’s scalp now. And, if they win control of Congress next year, this will be their first excuse to impeach Donald Trump again.\n\nDon’t miss the striking contrast.\n\nLeftists are shedding tears and expressing more emotion over two foreign drug dealers than they are for a young American woman who died defending our nation’s capital. Sarah Beckstrom was shot twice. Her murder was also a “double tap” meant to guarantee her death.\n\nBoth of these incidents involved efforts to protect America. Sarah Beckstrom was protecting the residents of Washington, D.C., and the U.S. military was protecting American lives by sinking cartel drug boats.\n\nBut all that matters to Democrats and the leftist media are the Venezuelan drug dealers. That tells you everything you need to know about the demented worldview of the political Left and the fake news media.\n\nThe Anti-American Left\n\nI’ve noticed in the past few days that many statements from leftist politicians about Sarah Beckstrom are short and perfunctory. Then they attack President Trump for deploying the National Guard to Washington, D.C. You see, it is Trump’s fault—not the Islamist murderer or Joe Biden, who brought him to America—that she is dead.\n\nI also noticed that many of these politicians increasingly offer only their “thoughts” to Sarah Beckstrom’s family. Just like Obama dropped references to our Creator when he quoted the Declaration of Independence and just like Biden dropped references to God in his Thanksgiving messages, many leftists have dropped references to “prayers” at times of tragedy and sorrow.\n\nToday’s Democrats think it is risky to offer prayers. We saw what happened when Christian conservatives offered prayers for the children killed in a Minneapolis Catholic church. Christians were criticized for mentioning prayers!\n\nTheir party is so deep into radical secularism and hostility to God that the people who want to be their party’s nominees for president and vice president dare not speak the name of the Creator of the universe, let alone utter the name of Jesus.\n\nIn the case of Sarah Beckstrom, all of the Left’s passion, interest, and commitment was on the side of her Islamist murderer when they brought him into the country along with hundreds of thousands of other people with the same worldview.\n\nThe Left’s commitment to mass migration was more important than the right to life of a native-born American woman who joined our military. Just like the massive influx of 20 million people that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris brought into the country was more important to the Left than the lives of Laken Riley, Jocelyn Nungaray, Rachel Morin, and every other victim of criminal illegal aliens.\n\nIn the confrontation between the American military and foreign drug traffickers, all of the Left’s passion, anger, and commitment is with the drug traffickers they have never met, who are not part of our country, and who are killing Americans.\n\nDemocrats rush to demand that those drug traffickers get every protection of the law—protection to keep them safe from the U.S. military and Commander-in-Chief Donald Trump.\n\nIn fact, when they pointedly reminded members of the military they don’t have to follow illegal orders, they had already said that deploying the National Guard was an illegal “abuse of power.” They were talking to the now deceased Sarah Beckstrom. They were trying to get people like her to defy orders of the commander-in-chief.\n\nThey have already said that strikes on drug cartel boats are “illegal killings.” They want our military personnel to stop following President Trump’s orders, and they want drug traffickers and their poison to come in.\n\nIf these drug thugs do get in, Democrats will fall on their sword to make sure each one has the best legal representation they can find from left-wing law firms. They have always shed more tears for the jihadists at Gitmo than they did for the soldiers who fought them.\n\nEvery day the American people are being told that everything the Trump administration is doing is “unprecedented” and “dangerous.” They are neither. They are normal actions. Here are two examples.\n\nThe Lie: They say Trump’s deployment of the National Guard is “unprecedented.”\n\nThe Truth: Presidents and governors have routinely deployed the National Guard for decades.\n\nIn fact, 25,000 National Guard troops were deployed to Washington, D.C., under Joe Biden. Not to keep the streets safe, but to shut off the U.S. Capitol from the American people. They put up barbed wire fences around the Capitol Building. The fencing and at least 2,000 troops stayed for months, well into 2021.\n\nBut Donald Trump bringing in 500 National Guardsmen to bring down crime in our nation’s capital is an “attack on Washington, D.C.” and “a prelude to martial law.”\n\nThe Lie: Democrats claim that Trump’s efforts to round up people who entered our country illegally and committed crimes are “unprecedented.”\n\nThe Truth: President Dwight Eisenhower deported an estimated 1.3 million illegal aliens during just one operation from 1954 to 1955. Bill Clinton deported 12 million illegal aliens during his two terms. Barack Obama deported 5.3 million illegal aliens.\n\nThose numbers are higher than what Donald Trump has been able to do so far (approximately 4 million total in both his first term and this year) because of the Left’s constant resistance against the enforcement of our immigration laws. It is their resistance that is “dangerous” and “unprecedented.”\n\nThe bottom line is that you have to ignore everything you’re seeing in the fake news media. The entire “unprecedented” narrative is a lie. They are taking everything that was once normal in America and acting like it’s a threat to everything we believe in.\n\nTrump Child Accounts Get A Boost\n\nThe One Big Beautiful Bill included a provision to help the next generation of Americans get a head start in life. Every U.S. citizen born from 2025 to 2028 will get a one-time $1,000 deposit from the federal government into a “Trump Account.” Parents, grandparents, employers, and charities—virtually anyone—can also contribute to a child’s Trump Account.\n\nSo, kudos to Michael Dell, CEO of Dell Technologies, and his wife, Susan! They announced yesterday that they are putting up $6.25 billion—that’s billion with a B—to provide additional “seed money” for the Trump Accounts of 25 million American children.\n\nMichael Dell told CNBC, “We know that when children have accounts like this, they’re much more likely to graduate from high school, from college, buy a home, start a business and less likely to be incarcerated.”\n\nTrump Accounts are a tremendous way to provide the next generation with more than just a financial boost. They will give young Americans some “skin in the game,” and, hopefully, a greater appreciation for free market capitalism. That’s what made Michael and Susan Dell’s incredible contribution possible.\n\nSocialism doesn’t create wealth. It destroys wealth.\n\nAnother Jihadist \n\nLuqmaan Khan, a 25-year-old undergraduate student, was arrested Monday night in Wilmington, Delaware. He’s charged with plotting an attack on the University of Delaware’s Police Department.\n\nIt seems our holiday season of Thanksgiving, Chanukah, and Christmas may be periodically interrupted by acts of terrorism from the “religion of peace.”\n\nTune In To Family Talk\n\nPlease tune in to Dr. James Dobson’s Family Talk radio show.

Angie Craig in the Minnesota Senate primary, which is already dividing high-profile Democrats. Buttigieg is the latest former — and potentially future — presidential contender to weigh in on the race. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., endorsed Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan last month in the race to replace retiring Democratic Sen. Tina Smith. Buttigieg's decision to back Craig is his first foray into a contested Senate primary this election cycle, as Democrats contend with multiple Senate nominating contests across the country. “Angie is a leader, a fighter, and a skilled legislator who is highly effective in serving Minnesotans well,” Buttigieg said in a statement shared with NBC News. “The Senate needs more people like Angie — who is unafraid to go anywhere and talk to anyone.\" Buttigieg went on to describe Craig as \"a forward-looking Democrat who has been consistent in standing up to whoever it takes in order to get things done for her constituents, and I’m proud to endorse her for the U.S. Senate.” Craig said in a statement that she was \"honored\" to have Buttigieg's endorsement and described him as \"a leader who knows how to put people first — from ensuring travelers are treated fairly and transparently to investing in safer roads, stronger supply chains and infrastructure that actually works for everyone.” The Democratic primary has already divided leaders in the party, including in the Senate. Craig has endorsements from Sens. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, Ruben Gallego of Arizona, Jacky Rosen of Nevada and Andy Kim of New Jersey. Flanagan, meanwhile, has endorsements from high-profile progressives, including Sanders, and Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey of Massachusetts, Chris Murphy of Connecticut, Jeff Merkley of Oregon and Martin Heinrich of New Mexico. Democrats are favored in the open-seat race — Republicans have not won a statewide election in Minnesota since 2006. But the GOP has been optimistic in recent years that they can make the state competitive, and former Vice President Kamala Harris won it by 4 percentage points last year. Former professional basketball player Royce White is running on the Republican side after having lost to Democratic Sen.
