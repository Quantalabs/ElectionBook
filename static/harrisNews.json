(Photo by Evan Agostini/Invision/AP)\n\nActress Sarah Jessica Parker has said that she tries to avoid political conversations on social media, arguing that there are better ways to express thoughts on important matters. While appearing on the Monday episode of Nicolle Wallace’s The Best People podcast, the Sex and the City actress defended her decision not to talk about politics on social media, asserting that other major elections took place before apps like Instagram existed and FDR was elected without social media in 1932.Parker further elaborated that she tries to avoid political conversations on social media, as she is not interested in quick little snippets when it comes to dealing with conflict or even elections. During the podcast, she also clapped back at her conservative haters who want her to “shut up and act.”“I often don’t talk on social media because I don’t think it’s a place that’s deserving of any real complicated conversation. I’m not interested in quick little snippets when it’s dealing with conflict or even elections sometimes,” Parker said. “I was so thoughtful about how I wanted to talk about the election because I think it turns into a distraction from the campaign. It turns into fodder. It’s misunderstood. You have no control over it,” The actress said that there are “so many ways to work toward a more civil society.”“Many things happened, right and left, Republicans and Democrats for many, many, many, many years—many generations were elected without someone having to say something on Instagram,” Parker further stated.The And Just Like That star called out “people on the other side” for trying to silence her left-leaning political opinions. She has often spoken vocally about her opposition to US President Donald Trump’s administration and its policies.Live EventsIn October 2024, ahead of the US presidential elections, Parker shared a photo of herself placing a Harris-Walz campaign sign on her New York City window with a list of all the reasons she was “voting for Vice President Kamala Harris and Governor Tim Walz.” “They seem to want everyone who disagrees to shut up,” she said. “It’s the weirdest thing—but not their side. It’s so off-kilter, like who can talk and who can’t? Who’s told to shut up and who isn’t? I’m just a citizen,” the actress added. Parker said that people have urged her to “be vocal” as a public figure, though she has had to find her way to be “comfortable being vocal.”“I’m not going to talk about stuff that I don’t feel educated on. I’m not going to jump in on really complex areas that I feel are deserving of far more thought, consideration, and nuance, which I know no one’s interested in,” she said. “And I just feel like I want to be helpful. I don’t want to hurt something that matters to me.”(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onSarah Jessica Parker political viewsSarah Jessica ParkerDonald TrumpSex and the City actresssocial media political discussions\n\n(Catch all the US News, UK News, Canada News, International Breaking News Events, and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

Kamala Harris’s campaign had high hopes that Taylor Swift might appear or even perform at her final rally in Philadelphia, but the singer declined, the book revealed.\nCampaign aides were reportedly instructed not to contact Taylor Swift’s team directly. Instead, Doug Emhoff, a former Hollywood lawyer, reached out quietly through Taylor Swift’s attorney Doug Baldridge in a bid to secure her support.\n“Taylor Swift proved to be a special challenge,” the book stated, as quoted by the New York Post. While the campaign wanted a high-profile endorsement, Taylor Swift ultimately opted to offer a limited show of support via social media after a key debate. Her attorney reportedly said, “Swift would do what Swift thought was best.”\nAt the time, Taylor Swift publicly endorsed Kamala Harris in an Instagram post signed off as “Childless Cat Lady”. Taylor Swift wrote, “I’m voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them.”\nTaylor Swift, who backed Joe Biden in the 2020 election, praised Kamala Harris as a “steady-handed, gifted leader,” and emphasized her desire for stability over chaos.\n“I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos,” she added in the post.\nKamala Harris’ Focus On A-Listers\nWith Taylor Swift staying at arm’s length, the Kamala Harris campaign turned to other A-list celebrities to energize the base. Oprah Winfrey, Lady Gaga, Bruce Springsteen, Megan Thee Stallion and Katy Perry were among those who participated in flashy rallies across battleground states.

Everyone from Walt Disney CEO Bob Iger to, yes, Bezos himself, will be at the so-called “summer camp for billionaires” when it kicks off on Wednesday.\n\nSun Valley has historically played host to the media and tech industry’s wheelings and dealings, famously serving as the launchpad of deals such as Disney’s 1995 acquisition of ABC and Comcast’s $30 billion takeover of NBCUniversal in 2011. The conference comes right after Paramount’s $16 million settlement with President Donald Trump, widely seen as a way to push through its pending merger with Skydance Media.\n\nThis year’s conference comes at a particularly unique time, from the rise of artificial intelligence threatening to disrupt everything to companies figuring out how to navigate an environment made unpredictable by Trump. That’s in addition to the typical merger talks that arise out of Sun Valley. \n\nHere’s what to expect and what to watch at the conference this week. \n\nThe AI race\n\nAI, like it has everywhere else, will likely take center stage in Sun Valley. Each of the industries represented at the conference, from media to entertainment to tech, are currently grappling with how to implement the technology and to what extent. \n\nExecutives have already been less gun-shy about talking about AI’s effects on jobs. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told CNBC last week that AI will lead to more automation and “fewer jobs” for humans in the near future, and Zuckerberg has said AI will erase a number of engineering jobs. \n\nHollywood is also coming to grips with how to use AI. Brian Grazer and his Imagine co-founder Ron Howard said last month they were both “excited” by the technology and use it for a number of projects, including post-production work and for helping brainstorm ideas. But they also said they cannot see it replacing professional writers anytime soon. \n\nThat prediction may be tested in the near future after AI companies scored a critical legal victory in June, allowing them to use copyrighted work to train AI models. How the entertainment world — as well as media outlets, which are looking at how to implement AI in the newsroom — can coexist with the major AI companies will likely be on the agenda. Even OpenAI COO Brian Armstrong has said a “level of trust” has yet to be established between Hollywood and the AI world so far; perhaps this week will lay the foundation — or it risks driving the two sides further apart. \n\nZuckerberg vs. Altman\n\nSpeaking of AI, the two attendees most likely to be at odds would be Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman (both are invited). Meta has emerged as OpenAI’s top rival of late — leapfrogging Elon Musk, who has been Altman’s most prominent critic in recent years — as the two companies battle for position in the budding AI field. \n\nOver the last several months, Zuckerberg poached four top OpenAI researchers and spent big bucks to make it happen, offering up to $100 million in first-year pay for employees to switch sides.\n\nAltman has made it clear he is not thrilled with the development, at least to those inside the ChatGPT parent company. He downplayed Meta’s hirings, saying the company “didn’t get [OpenAI’s] top people and had to go quite far down their list,” in an internal memo obtained by Wired; Altman added he found Meta’s poaching was “somewhat distasteful.” \n\nHaving the two occupy the same halls of the Sun Valley conference could lead to some awkward tension. \n\nNavigating Trump 2.0\n\nAttending tech and media executives will also likely be trading their opinions on the best way to lead their companies in today’s volatile political environment. Paramount and ABC’s recent settlements with Trump will be fresh on everyone’s mind, as well as the stock market, which has rebounded from its steep decline in April, following the president’s “Liberation Day” tariff plan announcement, to hit new all-time highs. (The pause on those tariffs is set to lift on Wednesday.)\n\nWhat is the best approach to take? Cutting deals with the “Art of the Deal” author has been one approach for some attendees, at least so far. OpenAI has partnered with the White House on its $500 million “Stargate” AI infrastructure plan — a plan the president has said will help the U.S. “dominate” rivals like China when it comes to AI. And Apple, led by CEO Tim Cook, earned kudos from the president after the company pledged $500 billion towards U.S. investment over the next few years. \n\nZuckerberg and Bezos, meanwhile, have both warmed up to President Trump following his victory last November. Not coincidentally, both of their companies are trading at all-time highs on Wall Street. Sun Valley attendees appear to have reached a consensus that they will get more with sugar than they do with salt when dealing with the second Trump Administration. \n\nGoing in the other direction and being critical has not worked out for one prominent ex-attendee recently; Elon Musk’s criticism of the Trump-backed “Big Beautiful Bill” has led to several major stock drops for Tesla. Sun Valley execs may believe keeping their mouths shut for a few years is the best move in order to keep their businesses running smoothly. \n\nThe following people have been invited by Allen & Company to this week’s conference:\n\nAlphabet CEO Sundar Pichai\n\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy\n\nAmazon founder Jeff Bezos\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook\n\nApple senior vice president Eddy Cue\n\nFormer Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella\n\nMicrosoft co-founder Bill Gates\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman\n\nSnap Inc.

Glenn Youngkin of Virginia\n\nA few big names are notably absent from the 2025 roll call, including Tesla and X CEO Musk, who last attended in 2022. \n\nAnother former attendee who will not be in Sun Valley this year is Paramount Chairwoman Shari Redstone, who was at the conference last year. Redstone’s absence comes a week after Paramount paid $16 million to settle a lawsuit over how “60 Minutes” edited an interview with Kamala Harris last year — a settlement that has been skewered by many in the press.\n\nOprah Winfrey, who has attended a handful of times in the past, including last year, was not on the invitee list this year, and conference staple Warren Buffett will not be in attendance after announcing he plans to step down as the boss of Berkshire Hathaway at the end of this year. \n\nHis successor, Greg Abel, is expected to attend once again; it will be worth watching in the years ahead if Abel is more willing to invest in tech companies represented at the conference than Buffett, who has been famously reticent to put money into the sector beyond Apple and Amazon.","summary":"Who and what to expect from the annual \"summer camp for billionaires\" \n\n\nThe post From AI to Trump 2.0, Here&#8217;s What&#8217;s Looming Over Sun Valley appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/sun-valley-storylines-zuckerberg-altman-trump/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/New_SunValleyFeature.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-08 20:23:49","author":"Sean Burch","authors":["Sean Burch"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.157},{"id":339619514,"title":"Elon Musk Might Have Finally Flown Too Close to the Sun","text":"Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nOn Monday, Tesla lost 6.8 percent of its value when the S&P 500 fell by less than 1 percent on tariff fears—marking the sixth-worst day of the year for the stock. The causes of Tesla’s slide were core issues to any electric car business: Elon Musk’s plan to launch a third political party and his doubling down on insinuations that Donald Trump is, at the least, protecting pedophiles and may be one himself. (The memes are hard to parse because, despite spending every day on his own social media platform, Musk is bad at posting.)\n\nIt’s nothing new for Musk to create stock market problems for Tesla with his social media antics. Time flies when you’re having fun, and it was seven years ago that the CEO caused a minicrisis by tweeting that he had secured the funding to take his electric car company private. (Technically, he is still supposed to have a lawyer review his Tesla-related posts, a directive that really should apply to all his posts, given how often his statements affect the company’s stock.) But Musk’s social media tantrums have been responsible for a couple of Tesla’s worst days in the market recently. This latest one was only about half as bad as the day in early June when Musk’s public meltdown over Trump led Tesla to lose 14 percent of its value in a day.\n\nMusk appeared to back off for a time, and the company’s stock rebounded. But now it’s worth contemplating a question whose answer once seemed as if it would never come: Are we finally watching the ultimate act of self-sabotage by Musk? Have we reached the logical limit of the things he can say, and the people he can alienate, without compromising his position as perhaps the most powerful (and definitely the richest) businessman in the world? For a chance, it may be worth considering it.\n\nTesla is a silly company in stock market terms, even in the calmest of times. It trades at an enormous premium to what its underlying sales and earnings say it “should” be worth. But the stock has been doing this for the better part of a decade, making Tesla one of the most valuable companies in the world. You will achieve nothing by quivering “B-b-but the price-to-earnings ratio!” as its stock continues to trade above this atmosphere. It was funky when Tesla added $100 billion of market capitalization in one day because it got through one day of about 20 robotaxis not driving into pedestrians on the streets of Austin. All of the most popular broad-based index funds have a lot of Tesla in them now, and you might not like that this is the kind of thing that indirectly affects your retirement, but that ship left port long ago. When your retirement already depends a little bit on the price of bitcoin, it’s hard to summon outrage about Tesla. It’s difficult to even feel as if each month on the roller coaster of Tesla stock tells us anything new.\n\nWe may now be in the midst of the last lesson this ridiculous stock will ever teach us. Lately, Tesla has provided a fresh spin on the way political corruption moves the price of one of the market’s most famous companies. It is the first stock in the S&P 500 to spend the better part of a year moving up and down intermittently based on the personal relationship between the president and the company’s boss swinging from great to terrible. A cycle that had been propping up Tesla now seems as if it has broken forever.\n\nYou could tell the story of Musk’s government service in pretty good detail just by looking at a chart of Tesla’s stock since the election. The stock bounced by nearly 15 percent the day after Trump defeated Kamala Harris, when the market observed that it would probably be nice for Tesla that the president would be someone who had just benefited from nine figures of political spending by the CEO of Tesla. At this point, it was a garden-variety story of influence peddling. Analysts were bullish, and explicit, that Trump’s being in the White House would mean tangible gains for Tesla’s stock. As soon as election night, a well-known Tesla bull was on CNBC suggesting that Trump’s win would add $40 or $50 to the stock price.\n\nThe stock slipped in mid-November, after Trump named Musk to a controversial role as the unaccountable spending slasher of the federal government. But it didn’t slip too far, and stock rallied into December before pulling back slightly. It was trading at around $425 at the time of Trump’s inauguration. After that, you know what happened: A significant chunk of Tesla’s gains was based on political favoritism, and the stock fell because of political disfavor by half of the politically engaged people in the country. By March, the stock had lost nearly half of the value it had held in November. For a few weeks, Musk sold a line that he was getting back to business and focusing less on politics. A tenuous peace with Trump held until Musk initiated the meltdown of their relationship in public in June, and now here we are. Musk had given back the corruption premium that Tesla’s stock earned from Trump’s win.\n\nMusk is sometimes frustrating to Tesla’s board of directors, because his eye wanders toward business and political projects that are bad for the company’s stock. But I think that if I were one of those directors, I’d be more pissed off about this next sequence than anything the CEO has ever done. One June 4, the day Musk lit the fuse on his relationship with Trump, Tesla’s stock lost 14 percent of its value and closed at $284.70. In the one month of trading days after that, the stock had gained back most of that day’s losses, about 11 percent, to trade at around $315 at the beginning of July. Musk then gave almost all of that back in one day of pedophile-adjacent tweeting and threats to launch a (probably doomed) political party. He tanked Tesla’s stock with social media fighting on Trump, watched it recover, then did the exact same thing. There’s a point at which exhaustion sets in for the people watching this all happen, isn’t there?\n\nMonday was an especially bad cocktail for the company; it had notes of Musk being “distracted” (a problem for Tesla since his days chasing down the acquisition of Twitter) and the overwhelming flavor of presidential beef. One wonders how the board Musk nominally answers to has been processing these events. On the one hand, directors have usually bent backward for Musk, who still oversees a company that trades way ahead of its fundamentals. They wouldn’t want him starting a competitive electric car company. But on the other, is it even tenable for Tesla to exist with Musk at the helm if he’s on these terms with Trump? He has ensured Tesla’s brand poisoning with a huge portion of the country, and that is unfortunately the portion of the country that hasn’t been negatively polarized against electric vehicles. If Musk is the target of mean Truth Social posts from the center of the cult of personality that makes up the nation’s other big political tent, then who will buy cars from his company? Europeans? Please. China? It turns out that no longer being cozy with Trump creates trouble there too.\n\nThat dog won’t hunt. Though Tesla’s board shouted down a Wall Street Journal report this spring that it had looked into finding a successor for Musk, it would be asinine not to poke around. Musk’s interests in getting close to Trump were always fraught for Tesla, because short-term regulatory favors needed to be weighed against alienating the likeliest Americans to actually buy an electric car. Now Musk has alienated the person who would grant him those favors, without doing anything to win back the people who would buy the cars. Masterful gambit, sir.","summary":"His feud with Donald Trump and conspiracy-laced social posts are tanking Tesla’s stock in ways even his most loyal investors can’t ignore.","url":"https://slate.com/technology/2025/07/elon-musk-donald-trump-tesla-stock-america-party.html?via=rss","image":"https://compote.slate.com/images/adb9495c-cdc2-4fe7-a6ec-8058d5c94126.jpeg?crop=1560%2C1040%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-08 19:43:00","author":"Alex Kirshner","authors":["Alex Kirshner"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.133},{"id":339609534,"title":"Who is Dr. Kevin O’Connor?

He then went to medical school at the New York Institute of Technology, where he graduated with a degree in osteopathic medicine in 1992. \n\nHe completed his residency training in family medicine at the Mountainside Hospital in Montclair, New Jersey, and became chief resident in 1995. He became a master flight surgeon in 2010 after completing Army flight surgeon training. \n\nPersonal life\n\nO’Connor lives in Maryland with his wife and three daughters.\n\nO’Connor became a White House physician in 2006. Starting in February 2009, he treated Biden while he was vice president and continued to serve him for the rest of his term.\n\nO’Connor served 22 years in the Army and was deployed to support missions in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Bosnia. In 2017, after retiring from the Army, he joined the George Washington Medical Faculty Associates as director of executive medicine. He also served in senior positions at the George Washington University Hospital, and he still teaches at the university’s School of Medicine and Health Sciences as an associate professor.\n\nBiden administration\n\nAfter Biden took office as president in January 2021, he appointed O’Connor as the new White House physician, replacing President Donald Trump’s former physician, Dr. Sean Conley. As the physician, O’Connor was on a team of doctors at the White House tasked with taking care of the president and his family’s medical needs, as well as those of White House staff.\n\nConcerns about Biden’s health and mental status were raised before he announced his reelection campaign in April 2023. Those concerns culminated with the announcement that Biden was dropping out of the presidential race in July 2024. He endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as the new candidate.\n\nThe same month Biden officials revealed the former president was diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer, a new book was released, Original Sin, in which CNN’s Jake Tapper and Axios’s Alex Thompson discuss Biden’s cognitive decline and how many people attempted to hide it from the public eye.\n\n“One person told us that the presidency was, at best, a five-person board with Joe Biden as chairman of the board,” Tapper told NPR. \n\nTapper and Thompson argue that while staff efforts to make Biden appear competent started small and innocent, those efforts turned into a massive cover-up that misled the public.\n\nAutopen investigation\n\nAs information about Biden’s mental fitness came to light, the Heritage Foundation’s Oversight Project released a memorandum in March accusing the president of unlawfully allowing an autopen to be used to sign various orders and pardons. Among the documents the group has analyzed, there were “two identical autopen signatures that were affixed to multiple acts of clemency,” suggesting it wasn’t the president who signed these documents but one or more members of his staff with his automated signature.\n\nBIDEN STEPS INTO SPOTLIGHT TO PUSH BACK AGAINST TRUMP AND DEFEND RECORD\n\nIn the following months, the House Oversight Committee launched an investigation into the Biden administration’s use of the autopen. It has subpoenaed O’Connor and other former Biden officials such as Neera Tanden, former director of the Policy Council; Anthony Bernal, former assistant to the president and senior adviser to the first lady; Annie Tomasini, former assistant to the president and deputy chief of staff; and Ashley Williams, former special assistant to the president and deputy director of Oval Office operations. Tanden is the only official of this group who has testified.\n\nRegarding O’Connor’s hearing, the committee aims to “investigate the circumstances” surrounding O’Connor’s last medical assessment of Biden in February 2024, during which he described Biden as “a healthy, active, robust 81-year-old male, who remains fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency.” It also wants to determine if O’Connor’s “financial relationship” with the Biden family affected his assessments of the former president in any way, according to the initial request from the committee.","summary":"Dr. Kevin O’Connor, who was former President Joe Biden&#8216;s physician, is a key figure in the House Oversight Committee&#8216;s investigation into White House aides&#8217; alleged cover-up of Biden&#8217;s health.

TIM WALZ TURNS DOWN NY TIMES INTERVIEW REQUESTS ABOUT RESPONSE TO GEORGE FLOYD RIOTS Rahma told the Times that his reasoning for not airing the interview was because he didn’t want to upset the Muslim community, and that he was hoping to ask Harris questions about the Biden administration’s policy regarding the Israel–Hamas war. \"It was so complicated because I’m Muslim and there’s something going on in the world that 100% of Muslims care about,\" Rahma told the Times. \"And then they made it worse by talking about anchovies.

A poll conducted by the Glengariff Group and the Detroit Regional Chamber in May found that Stevens is the only Democratic candidate leading against Republican candidate former Rep.

Most senior aides had no idea the first lady planned to attend, revealing her willingness to act independently. \n\nBut while Jill Biden demonstrated her independence from the White House, Bernal was right there with her leading the East Wing. \n\n“He quickly bonded with Jill Biden and never left her side, becoming unflinchingly loyal to her and using his proximity to her to exert power wherever he decided. It was often unclear if the opinion he was expressing was his own or the first lady’s. Sometimes, when donors or voters asked her questions, Bernal would jump in to answer,” the authors said. \n\nJust as Jill jumped to Hunter’s defense during his high-profile trial, she became the president’s staunchest supporter following his disastrous debate performance against President Donald Trump.\n\n“Joe isn’t just the right person for the job,” the first lady said at a fundraiser soon after the debate. “He’s the only person for the job.” \n\nThe book alleges that Jill Biden had always played the “role of the protective spouse, encouraging the president to eat vegetables, keeping him on time, and questioning staffers when she felt they erred.”\n\nIn one such case in January 2022, a Biden aide apologized to the first lady when she questioned why they allowed a press conference to go on for too long, according to the book. \n\nAs Biden struggled to successfully defend his debate performance, with donors and Democratic politicians growing weary, and “her husband in the fight of his political life, Jill was making clear: The Democratic Party had to stick with Joe,” the authors said. \n\nAfter the debate, the Bidens took a pre-planned family trip to Camp David.\n\n“The president was not entertaining the idea of dropping out of the race; he was taking stock of how bad things really were,” the authors said of Biden’s trip to Camp David. \n\nThe authors described how dropping out “was not even a consideration” at Camp David, and how the first lady was part of those in the inner family circle who persuaded Biden to stay in the race, despite mounting pressure from party leaders and donors to step down. \n\nBiden huddled with his family in Camp David during the last few days of June, then appeared for debate damage-control interviews on network TV in the weeks following, referring to the debate as a bad night and blaming a cold for his off-night.\n\n“Biden also acknowledged he needed more sleep and said he told his staff that he should not participate in events that start after 8 p.m. But his message was clear: He was staying in the race,” the authors said. \n\nLess than a month after the debate, and one week after an assassination attempt on Trump, Biden announced he was suspending his re-election campaign, and later endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee. \n\nFox News Digital has written extensively dating back to the 2020 presidential campaign about Biden’s cognitive decline and his inner circle’s alleged role in covering it up.\n\nA Biden spokesperson did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment.","summary":"First lady Jill Biden's political rise coincided with the end of her husband's political career, according to a new book about how President Joe Biden lost the White House. ","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/07/08/us-news/new-book-exposes-jill-bidens-power-grab/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/107826326.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-08 19:05:23","author":"Fox News","authors":["Fox News"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.08},{"id":339613846,"title":"Kamala Harris aide urged 'The View' hosts to ask again after VP flubbed question on differences with Biden","text":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris' aide implored the co-hosts of \"The View\" to try asking Harris a second time about what she would have done differently from Joe Biden during the October 2024 interview on the ABC show, according to a new book. \"As you showed the famous clip there on ‘The View,' she gives that answer, and our book reports her aides backstage, head in their hands.

Hostin initially asked Harris about the biggest specific difference between a potential Harris presidency and Biden's presidency.

Harris didn't give the answer she prepared with her aides, which according to the authors, praised Biden and emphasized that she didn't want to look back and critique their administration. The prepared answer also acknowledged that she was her own person. Her aides also encouraged her to mention that she planned to appoint a Republican to her cabinet, which the former vice president did mention towards the end of the interview.

Kroft appeared on Paramount-owned Comedy Central to discuss the settlement with Stewart, who didn’t pull punches when discussing his own employer. Kroft, who retired from the show in 2019 after a 30-year run, said his former colleagues are devastated that CBS and its parent company settled Trump’s \"election interference\" lawsuit. \"I think there is a lot of fear over there… fear of losing their job, fear of what’s happening to the country, fear of losing the First Amendment,\" Kroft said. PARAMOUNT, CBS FORCED TO PAY EIGHT FIGURES, CHANGE EDITORIAL POLICY IN SETTLEMENT WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP The lawsuit alleged CBS News deceitfully edited a \"60 Minutes\" interview last year with then-Vice President Kamala Harris in order to make her appear more articulate ahead of Election Day. Many legal experts and Paramount’s own attorneys insisted the lawsuit was meritless, but CBS’ parent company settled it anyway. Kroft and Stewart insisted that \"60 Minutes\" did nothing wrong and emphasized that CBS didn’t issue an apology as part of the settlement. \"They never said, ‘We screwed up,’ they just paid the money,\" Kroft said. \"It was a shakedown. That’s what I call it,\" he continued. \"Some people call it extortion.\" Paramount's controlling shareholder Shari Redstone reportedly pushed for the settlement in hopes of paving the way for Trump’s FCC to approve a long-planned, lucrative merger with David Ellison’s Skydance Media. Fox News Digital has learned that the sum being paid to Trump could reach north of $30 million, with $16 million being paid upfront for his future presidential library, in addition to another eight-figure allocation set aside for advertisements, public service announcements or other similar transmissions, in support of conservative causes paid for by the network’s incoming ownership in the future. FAIR ELECTION FUND URGES FCC TO HOLD CBS ACCOUNTABLE FOR 'UNLAWFUL CONDUCT’ RELATED TO ’60 MINUTES’ INTERVIEW Stewart asked Kroft if the settlement was simply a payment designed in order to push the merger through. The \"60 Minutes\" icon suggested Redstone \"wanted the sale to go through\" so she could pocket roughly $2 billion, but Trump planned to \"settle a score.\" \"He was upset with ’60 Minutes,’ and he decided he was going to sue,\" Kroft said. \"So the implication is, you don’t get your $8 billion merger, you don’t get your $2 billion payout unless you give me a tremendous amount of money,\" Stewart responded. \"That strikes me as – and I’m obviously not a lawyer – but I did watch ‘Goodfellas,’ that sounds illegal,\" Stewart said. Kroft shot back, \"Yes, it does.\" '60 MINUTES' KAMALA HARRIS INTERVIEW AT CENTER OF TRUMP LAWSUIT RUNS AFOUL OF CRONKITE-ERA CBS GUIDELINES Paramount has defended the settlement. \"Companies often settle litigation to avoid the high and somewhat unpredictable costs of legal defense, the risk of an adverse judgment that could result in significant financial or reputational damage, and the disruption to business operations that prolonged legal battles can cause. Settlement offers a negotiated resolution that allows companies to focus on their core objectives rather than being mired in uncertainty and distraction,\" a Paramount spokesperson told Fox News Digital. ABC also settled a defamation lawsuit in December with then-President-elect Trump for $15 million, after anchor George Stephanopoulos repeatedly and incorrectly asserted Trump had been found \"liable for rape\" in a civil trial last year.

Delays of six months or more dragged out the process of building housing and led to increased costs, while also spooking developers wanting to avoid regular legal challenges under CEQA. According to a poll from the University of California, Irvine’s School of Social Ecology, 70% of California voters say housing should be a major funding priority, and 33% rank it as their highest priority, nearly double the next highest issue.\n\nCalifornia may be a solid blue state, but the pillars on which the state Democratic Party’s power rests are becoming more precarious. Former Vice President Kamala Harris, a California native, performed worse than any Democratic presidential candidate in California since 2004. President Donald Trump flipped three of the state’s 10 largest counties, all three of which had backed Democrats since the 2004 election. Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) got dragged into a recall election in 2021, which had his team nervous for at least one month, and then won an underwhelming victory over a little-known state senator in his reelection campaign in 2022, winning by 6 fewer points than he did in his 2018 victory.\n\nOil deregulation\n\nAs housing and the overall cost of living get more expensive in California, California Democrats are going to become more responsive to complaints about housing, which is how we end up here. You can see this effect in areas other than housing. Take gas prices, for example, an issue that state Democrats have suddenly woken up to as a driver of the state’s cost-of-living crisis. Earlier this year, California Democrats grilled state regulators about gas prices and carbon emissions, acting stunned that the California Air Resources Board does not take into account gas prices when pushing its regulations.\n\nCalifornia Democrats refused to block the latest set of regulations, which are expected to jack up California’s highest-in-the-nation gas prices further, but Senate Democrats have begun pushing a bill that would cap the price of fuel standard credits that fuel producers and importers are forced to purchase if they don’t meet the state’s restrictive fuel standards. These offsets supposedly save the planet (spoiler: they don’t), but they also vastly increase the cost of operating in California for refineries and other industries that rely on fossil fuels.\n\nThat has become a problem for California, which is on the verge of losing two more refineries, which would cement a 21% decrease in the state’s refining output over three years. Gas prices in California are projected to top $8 per gallon by the end of next year as a result. Gas prices have proven to be a potent electoral issue. Democratic state Sen. Josh Newman was recalled in 2018 in his Los Angeles area district after voting to increase the gas tax, costing Senate Democrats their two-thirds supermajority at the time. California voters nearly repealed the gas tax later that year in a statewide ballot proposition, which only failed because the state’s Democratic attorney general deliberately described the measure in as confusing a way as possible to scare voters away from supporting it.\n\nIn that same vein, the vice chair of the California Energy Commission, appointed by Newsom, is recommending pausing the 2023 profit cap on oil refineries that Newsom signed into law in 2023. Newsom even supported this reversal, which, again, is happening because Valero and Phillips 66 are planning on each closing a refinery in the state.\n\nNatural gas\n\nThe fear of political consequences altering California’s approach to climate policy actually stretches back years. The Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility is a prime example. Newsom campaigned on closing it. He said in the early days of his first term in 2019 that he wanted to speed up the closure process, which was set to last about 10 years. By 2023, Newsom had begun advocating that Aliso Canyon stay open, and the state was even considering increasing its storage by two-thirds.\n\nIn December 2024, the California Public Utilities Commission voted 4-0 to extend the plant’s lifespan, pushing its possible closure from 2027 into the 2030s. This came over the objections of activists, and the vote occurred in the same month that the distribution of a $71 million settlement was announced for the facility’s 2015 methane leak, one of the largest gas leaks in the history of the country.\n\nAll the environmentalist momentum would suggest that Aliso Canyon was on its way out, but Newsom and state regulators couldn’t pull the trigger. Newsom said in a statement that “Aliso Canyon must be closed for good, but without harming working families with skyrocketing utility bills.” According to Newsom, “It would be reckless and irresponsible to burden working families with enormous price increases, all with no guarantee of being able to keep the lights on,” and that this was “a reasonable path that protects residents near the facility and doesn’t throw the natural gas market into chaos.”\n\nNuclear power\n\nThe same thing happened with Diablo Canyon, California’s last operating nuclear plant. A 2016 agreement between PG&E, which runs the plant, and environmentalists and the plant’s workers union set a closure date for Diablo Canyon in 2025. But Newsom was plagued by summer after summer of headlines about rolling blackouts as California’s renewable energy failed to keep up with energy demand. The plant accounts for over 8% of California’s energy production on its own. According to PG&E, the plant also accounts for 17% of California’s carbon-free energy.\n\nNewsom thus advocated to keep the plant open, and state Democrats voided the closure deal in 2022 at Newsom’s request. California energy regulators voted in December 2023 to extend the plant’s lifespan to 2030, and federal regulators are poised to renew the plant’s license for another 20 years, just in case California Democrats get cold feet again when it comes to closing the plant and losing almost one-tenth of the state’s energy in five years.\n\nAgain, the motivation for this walk-back of climate policy was a fear of political consequences. Newsom and state Democrats are afraid of being blamed for rolling blackouts, just as they are afraid of being blamed for rising gas prices, the state’s affordability crisis, the housing crisis, or rising energy prices. They know that even traditionally Democratic California voters have a breaking point, and that means that environmental policy must be slowed or even reversed as possible political backlash brews.","summary":"The Democratic Party’s monopoly on power in California is, apparently, not as invincible as it seems.

Tariffs are back, maybe...Trump is doing a U-turn on Ukraine and sending them more aid... his base is furious about the mess that is the Jeffrey Epstein saga... Elon's making a run at a third party. But the thing I want to focus on today is something rather small, which didn't get a lot of notice, but is near and dear to my heart as you'll know if you've been reading for a while: As of this week, you no longer have to take your shoes off when going through airport security.The TSA is in the process of dropping the hated \"shoes off\" rule, which has been in place for almost 20 years. The agency, part of Homeland Security, has not officially made the announcement but an internal memo is going around showing it is indeed taking effect nationwide. This is a big win for common sense and good on DHS for finally seeing the light! Is it the biggest thing happening right now? No. But it illustrates something about the Trump admin's political priorities that gets far too little attention... that is, they are willing to do things that makes life slightly less annoying for regular Americans.Contrast that with the Democrats. Here in the People's Republic of New York City, there's a new law called \"Skip the Stuff\" which bans food establishments from offering customers complimentary utensils, straws, napkins, condiments, etc. The effect of this law is when you're grabbing a bite, you now must remember to specifically ask for the tools you will need to consume your sad little lunch. If you don't remember, you end up like me the other day: eating pasta salad on a bench with my hands and having to ask a passerby for a napkin like a bum.The point I am trying/failing to articulate here is that if you become known as the political party of annoying and stupid bullshit, while the other party is busy making peoples' lives slightly less annoying, you will never win another national election. Trump is a political savant who understands this innately. His \"no tax on tips\" campaign pledge is a great example. The deduction codified in the new tax law is a drop in the bucket compared to the tax savings you get if you're a millionaire business owner, but it'll save some service workers a couple bucks and it's a great, easy-to-remember slogan.Another one that didn't get much attention: The EPA is eliminating credits to automakers who adopt the much-despised \"stop/start\" function, that feature of new cars that automatically turns off the engine when you're stopped in traffic or at a light. This was an Obama-era fuel-savings rule that didn't save much fuel, added wear-and-tear to the starter, and was otherwise just simply annoying, especially if you drive in a lot of stop-and-go traffic.You could take the other side here and argue that these are all unimportant, shiny baubles to distract the public while the administration rips the copper wiring out of the walls of the federal government. Maybe so, but these things have political salience to regular folks who don't spend all their time reading about how the tax bill heavily favors the rich, or how Trump and his family are profiting off the office of the president to a degree we've never seen. None of that matters to a rushed parent trying to herd their kids through TSA, who now won't have to worry about stopping to take off and then put back on their shoes.Conversely, every time I forget to ask for a fork for my overpriced pasta salad, I will think poorly of my local elected officials who seem to go out of their way to make my life just a little bit harder.Kamala Harris' Comeback Hopes Take a Major Blow Former vice president Kamala Harris has kept a fairly low profile since losing the 2024 election to President Donald Trump. But as she weighs whether to run for California governor next year, experts say that might be a safer bet than mounting another bid for the White House. Harris has said little about her future plans, though she is expected to announce her decision by the end of the summer.

One Senator’s Vote Shocks Me More Than Most.","text":"Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nSen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska opens her memoir peeing in a bucket. She has flown to a remote village in her state some 500 miles from a roadway, accessible only via a series of ever-smaller airplanes, to a place where “people were concerned with survival” and “hunted, fished, and gathered berries to feed their families.” When she has to use the toilet during a visit, she pops into a constituent’s two-room plywood home, where she relieves herself into a 5-gallon bucket in their kitchen, a toilet seat atop it, and wipes with a roll of bath tissue sitting on the stovetop. “My political philosophy is simple,” Murkowski writes. “I work for these people.”\n\nAnd by voting for Donald Trump’s “Big, Beautiful Bill,” she just sold them out, along with millions of Americans like them.\n\nNearly 40 percent of Alaskans are on Medicaid, and many of them will almost surely lose their health care coverage thanks to legislation that is effectively a massive cash transfer from the poor to the rich, and perhaps the most radical decimation of the American health care system in history. Murkowski was skeptical of the legislation, but Republicans packed the bill with a bunch of Alaska-specific incentives in a move so cynical and transparent that Freedom Caucus Republicans characterized it as “loaded with pork to buy key Senate votes.” These are things like tax write-offs for whaling boat captains and various carve-outs so that poor Alaskans don’t see quite the devastation that other poor Americans will, at least not right away. The pork-for-votes strategy worked: Murkowski signed on.\n\nOn X, Murkowski wrote that “this was one of the hardest votes” she has taken in her Senate career. She added, “It is the people of Alaska that I worry about the most, especially when it comes to the potential loss of social safety net programs—Medicaid coverage and SNAP benefits—that our most vulnerable populations rely on.” One of the gifts she got in exchange for her vote was $50 billion to fund rural health care. But money to keep hospitals open isn’t all that useful if no one can afford to actually go to them to get treatment.\n\nMost gallingly, Murkowski wrote, “While we have worked to improve the present bill for Alaska, it is not good enough for the rest of our nation—and we all know it.” It is, she added, her “sincere hope … that this is not the final product.” But she still voted for it—legislation she herself said “is not ready for the President’s desk” and knows is not good enough for the country.\n\nMurkowski is part of a subset of self-styled independent-minded conservatives in Washington who run with an R next to their names but insist that they aren’t like those other Republicans. They’re “mavericks,” “outsiders,” principled conservatives who are willing to break ranks to stand up for what’s right.\n\nExcept, of course, they don’t. Over and over again, they’ve revealed themselves as unprincipled hacks, gutless cowards, or both—people who will allow tremendous damage to be wrought on their constituents because they’re too scared of big donors or, more often, the wannabe strongman in the Oval Office.\n\nMurkowski is the most prominent example at the moment, given that she spoke out against the bill, voted for it anyway, then deemed it not good enough. But she’s far from the only one. The puffed-up mostly-men of the Freedom Caucus spit and gibbered about all the ways in which the legislation failed to live up to its promises, even issuing a 15-point memo on the matter. Then they all caved, voted for the bill, and smiled for a photo afterward, in what is by now a well-established pattern of whining, threatening, and ultimately capitulating. Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri wrote an op-ed in the New York Times titled “Don’t Cut Medicaid,” then voted to cut Medicaid. “The nub of the conflict,” he wrote, was one question: “Will Republicans be a majority party of working people or a permanent minority speaking only for the C-suite?” Hawley’s own answer: a permanent minority speaking only for the C-suite—certainly not the 1.2 million Missourians on Medicaid.\n\nThe One Big Beautiful Bill is the most striking example yet of just how monolithic the once ideologically heterogenous Republican Party has become—and how profoundly unprincipled, to the point of cultish. Republicans spent decades building a political ideology around supporting small government, business, Christianity, and fiscal responsibility, and then came Donald Trump. This bill is a fiscal atomic bomb, adding trillions to America’s already maxed-out national credit card. It’s needlessly cruel. And it’s a radical expansion of government, and of Immigration and Customs Enforcement in particular: That agency and other immigration enforcement mechanisms are getting more than $100 billion.\n\nBut there’s something even more nefarious afoot. Much of the conversation around the bill has centered on the fact that Republicans have a new and fragile coalition, one that finally includes a huge number of poor and working-class Americans whose interests are well out of line with those of the wealthy elite, to whom the GOP has long catered. Trump did better than Democrat Kamala Harris among Americans making less than $50,000 a year and among those making less than $100,000, while Harris saw an advantage among the six-figure-plus set. And Trump did spectacularly well with voters who haven’t graduated from college; from 2020 to 2024, he even doubled his support among non-college Black voters and won half of non-college Hispanic voters. It is this contingent—those making less than $50,000 a year, no college degree—that is the most likely to be on Medicaid.\n\nRepublicans know that their Medicaid cuts are a disaster for their voters and potentially for their party. That’s why they set them to go into effect after the 2026 midterms, so that they can place the blame on Democrats. That might be a lie, but Republicans are banking on the likelihood that some of the people who voted for the Leopards Eating People’s Faces Party and got their faces eaten will allow themselves to be convinced that, actually, they were attacked by donkeys. The architects of this bill may be cruel and cynical, but they are not stupid.\n\nCommentators and politicians on the left and right alike have argued that this bill is particularly foolish because it inflicts serious pain on Trump’s own voters and is so unpopular that, even without the cuts going into effect, it could hand Democrats significant midterm wins and potentially decimate Republican gains among the working class. And the argument is correct: It is abhorrent that the GOP is extracting health care from poor and working-class citizens to pay for tax cuts for the rich. Just as abhorrent, though, is the assumption that Trump, who is president of all Americans, serves just those who voted for him—and that Republicans should care about struggling Americans only if those Americans line up behind their leader.\n\nNot so long ago, U.S. presidents assured voters that it didn’t matter whom they cast their ballots for; the president was on everyone’s side. Now Trump rails against liberals and Democrats and journalists, American citizens he deems “enemies of the people.” He used the Fourth of July to tell a crowd that when it comes to the people who voted against his bill (mostly Democrats), “I really do, I hate them.” That he is also willing to make his own supporters suffer is of course strategically stupid. But it’s no more morally terrible than if these cuts had primarily hit Democrats.\n\nThis my-supporters-should-get-theirs/screw-my-opponents mentality seems to have infected GOP senators too—including those who, like Murkowski, got special gifts for their state even as they fully understood just how shattering this bill would be for millions of other Americans. This is not standard pork-barrel politics, in which every member of Congress vies to get some benefit for their district as part of a bloated budget. This is several elected officials who know that their votes are going to kick eligible people off Medicaid, shutter rural hospitals, and drive poverty, illness, despair, and even death nationwide—and who, in exchange for some special treatment for their state and a better chance of getting reelected, sold out their country.\n\nNot every Republican got on board, but it’s telling that those who didn’t are bracing for impact. Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina announced his retirement, apparently convinced that his “no” vote would make him such a target of the Trump right that it wasn’t worth running for reelection. Rep. Thomas Massie is expecting a primary challenge. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine has tussled with Trump before and has occasionally stood up to him, as she did when she refused to vote to confirm Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court. But Collins—who, like Murkowski, campaigns as a moderate true-to-herself independent tough enough to take a stand—has also caved to Trump, most notably in voting to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the court. He went on to overturn Roe v. Wade and end the era of legal abortion for Americans.\n\nMurkowski, notably, was the only Republican to vote against Kavanaugh’s confirmation, a move many politics watchers interpreted as a sign that she was at least willing to take a stand for the basic rights of women. But then she voted to confirm Barrett—who went on to join Kavanaugh in the decision overturning Roe. It can be hard for a casual observer to make sense of where Murkowski decides to stand firm (on Kavanaugh, on voting to impeach Trump in 2021) and where she doesn’t (on Barrett, on devastating Medicaid cuts).\n\nIn her memoir, Murkowski dedicates an entire chapter to the Kavanaugh confirmation, and it’s among the most searing in the book. Her state is home to an epidemic of violence against women, and particularly against Native women. A young Alaskan girl is raped, murdered, and discarded in a case that roils the state; this story is sitting heavily on Murkowski’s shoulders as Kavanaugh heads to the Senate. And so is, she says, her own story, one she has long kept secret. When, during the Kavanaugh hearings, a reporter asked if she had ever had a #MeToo moment, she said yes—but gave no more details. In her memoir, she shares more: A man she knew lured her into the woods and forced her to touch him. She was in the second grade. “That place still haunts me, all these years later, a dark spot in the woods, hidden in my mind,” she writes.\n\nMurkowski is capable of being brave. I don’t like many of her politics, but I do trust that she is a principled and decent person. She writes in her book: “Legislating, for me, is not transactional. I need to believe in the decisions I make. That alone made me something of an anomaly to some in Washington—but probably closer to what most Americans feel is the right way to govern.” And I think that, most of the time, she believes that.\n\nWhich is why her vote for the One Big Beautiful Bill feels like so much more of a violation than those cast by her Republican colleagues, who have nearly to a one either lined up enthusiastically behind a man who wants to be king or have so badly wanted to remain in power that they’ve brushed the better angel off their shoulder so they might quiet the persistent voice reminding them that they know what they’re doing is wrong. Murkowski caved to the exact kind of transactional legislating she decries and voted for a bill she does not have faith in and cannot actually stand behind.\n\nWhy? Murkowski has endured Trumpian blowback, and she has been one of the few conservatives to electorally survive it. She understands that most Americans are relatively moderate, and that even Trump voters may like his vibe but not a lot of his policies. She’s not up for reelection until 2028.\n\nBut with Trump winning Alaska by 13 points in 2024—up from 10 in 2020—and the incumbent Democrat in the House losing to a pro-Trump Republican, Murkowski may well feel that her own political future requires a little less independence and a little more of what the president demands: submission. It is easier, it turns out, to advertise oneself as a principled conservative who is willing to assert their independence even at the most difficult moments than it is to actually be someone willing to risk their own power, even to protect millions of their far less fortunate fellow citizens. This is a familiar pattern when it comes to modern authoritarian leaders: They grab power, but too many of those around them also willingly hand it over. “Most of the power of authoritarianism is freely given,” On Tyranny author Timothy Snyder notes. Sometimes this is by citizens themselves. Often it is by others in positions of power.\n\nMurkowski ends her memoir with a scene in church, turning to her husband and telling him she has had an epiphany: “I know why it is that I do the things that I do,” she says. “Why I’m not afraid to stand out there. It’s not courage—it is the strength of knowing who you are. Because no one can take from me who I am and what I believe, unless I give it up.”\n\nFreedom, as the saying goes, isn’t free. And neither is the independence born of confidence and self-respect—the strength of knowing who you are. That is less some innate characteristic than the lifelong work of strengthening one’s moral core so that, when tested, one does not sway.\n\nUnless, of course, one voluntarily bows down. Because, like freedom and power, self-respect—the strength of knowing who one is and what one believes and acting accordingly—doesn’t need to be seized by the authoritarian, so long as even those who know better are willing to give it up.","summary":"It’s a striking example of just how monolithic the once ideologically heterogenous Republican Party has become.","url":"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2025/07/big-beautiful-bill-lisa-murkowski-republicans-donald-trump.html?via=rss","image":"https://compote.slate.com/images/933d1f47-ba91-46bc-8733-b6fa49fc9141.jpeg?crop=1560%2C1040%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-08 16:18:48","author":"Jill Filipovic","authors":["Jill Filipovic"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.016},{"id":339592946,"title":"Opinion - Morning Joe baffled that AOC, Mamdani and Bernie Sanders are Democrats’ only hope","text":"The moderate-liberal faction of the Democratic Party just keeps getting bad news. Democratic leadership, in the persons of Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), is temperamentally moderate, culturally progressive, and lukewarm at best on economic populism — which means they aren’t exactly loved by the left. And it turns out, that unique combination of beliefs is fairly unpopular with the Democratic Party’s base.\n\nDon’t take my word for it: Even as mainstream a liberal as MSNBC host Joe Scarborough has noticed that socialist-friendly left progressives are routing the more moderate voices in the party — people like Senator Bernie Sanders, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and of course, Zohran Mamdani, the democratic socialist sensation who easily defeated former Gov. Andrew Cuomo to become the Democratic Party’s nominee for New York City mayor. Scarborough stated the problem for moderates quite plainly on Morning Joe: “Why can’t moderate Democrats … make that same compelling message?”\n\nIt’s a very good question. I have an answer, although Morning Joe won’t like it: Increasingly, there’s less and less room in the Democratic Party for moderate voters.\n\nPart of the problem, undoubtedly, is that the Democratic Party’s elite leadership has failed, catastrophically, time and time again, to deliver what its voters want. Say what you will about the Republican Party, but GOP leaders finally realized that the base loves Trump, and wants elected members of the party to fall in line with him — and now GOP leaders rarely try to thwart Trump directly. If they work against him, it’s always in secret. They know they can’t openly oppose Trump.\n\nThe Democratic Party, on the other hand, is extremely reluctant to embrace its most popular standard bearers. We can go all the way back to 2016, of course, when the party pulled out all the stops to coronate Hillary Clinton as the candidate, even when rival Bernie Sanders proved unexpectedly popular. You know how that turned out.\n\nThen, this time around, Democratic leadership steadfastly maintained that no one should challenge, debate, or provide an opportunity to primary voters to select someone other than Joe Biden. After Biden’s infirmities were exposed, the party picked Kamala Harris … and she lost.\n\nYou see the problem? Democratic elites just don’t understand their voters. Now it’s true that not everyone who is part of the Democratic base wants economic populism, or socialism … but the share that wants neoliberalism paired with cultural progressivism seems to be shrinking every day.\n\nIf you want to beat a Sanders or a Mamdani, you have to do better than a Clinton or a Cuomo. And as far as the New York mayoral primary goes, this should have been obvious. Cuomo’s failures were even more apparent than Hilary Clinton’s or Kamala Harris’s. In recent memory, Cuomo resigned his office after a sexual misconduct scandal and a COVID deaths-related corruption scandal.\n\nDemocratic elites are probably right to be concerned about the general electability of candidates like Ocasio-Cortez and Mamdani, who have previously espoused views on crime and foreign policy and gender and all sorts of other issues that place them on the extreme left fringes, despite their relatively appealing personalities and policy platforms on other issues. But politics is about a lot more than policy.\n\nThe Democratic Party’s so-called moderates are failing a very basic likability test, and the ultimate beneficiary of their shortsightedness is the eventual 2028 Republican nominee — presumably Vice President JD Vance.\n\nRobby Soave is co-host of The Hill’s commentary show “Rising” and a senior editor for Reason Magazine.

Well, a large part of the people blame none other than her husband, Doug Emhoff, whom she married in 2014.\n\nAccording to a new book, the former Second Gentleman of the United States was given the task of getting Taylor Swift to support her campaign, but he ultimately failed to launch the deal.\n\nThere was a rumor that the pop icon would be performing at Harris’ last appearance in Philadelphia. However, despite Emhoff’s utmost effort to get her on the stage, Swift reportedly declined the offer. In their book, 2024: How Trump Retook the White House and the Democrats Lost America, journalists Josh Dawsey, Tyler Pager, and Isaac Arnsdorf claimed that Taylor Swift was not on board with doing more than just publicly backing the Democratic Presidential candidate, Kamala Harris.\n\nThe book, launched this Tuesday, concluded, “Swift proved to be a special challenge.” Although the Love Story singer strongly showed her support for the Biden-era Vice President following their debate with Donald Trump in September, she refrained from directly taking part in her campaign trail, as per Irish Star. \n\nIt has been revealed that Harris’ husband, Doug Emhoff, contacted Doug Baldridge, who is Swift’s lawyer, to get her to agree to perform, but was reportedly turned down. “Nothing more than the endorsement ever materialized,” the authors of the upcoming book noted.\n\nDoug was in charge of getting Taylor Swift on board?!?\nBAHhHahahHaHA 🤣😂🤣 pic.twitter.com/XXeWD2Erue\n— Walter Curt (@WCdispatch_) July 8, 2025 \n\nThat night, the Philadelphia rallygoers missed Taylor Swift, but enjoyed great performances and performances by other big stars such as Lady Gaga, Oprah Winfrey, Fat Joe, The Roots, will.i.am, and Ricky Martin.\n\nIn an attempt to mobilize low-propensity voters, Kamala Harris managed to get many A-listers involved in her election campaign, including Katy Perry, Megan Thee Stallion, Jon Bon Jovi, Christiana Aguilera, Mumford & Sons, and 2 Chainz.\n\nWhile Beyonce, Cardi B, and Jennifer Lopez did not perform, they also showed up in support of the Democratic candidate. These high-profile, high-production events took place in battleground states and reportedly cost the campaign a heft $20 million.\n\nHowever, despite their solid attempts, it ultimately worked in Donald Trump‘s favor the next day. The authors of the new book noted that these high-budget events brought little to no extra credit for Kamala Harris, noting that there was no proof that these stars ultimately swayed voters to the Democrats’ side.\n\nDoug may have come into his “political spouse” role late in life, but damn, he’s good at it! 🙂‍↕️ https://t.co/lK1WdQ0ehl https://t.co/Bp4ZzDU0v8 pic.twitter.com/u9oC3ZRjBX\n— Kayah (@__Kayah__) July 8, 2025 \n\n“Privately, some campaign staff raised concerns that the major rallies may not be worth the millions of dollars they cost to stage or the staff investment,” the journalists wrote in their book.\n\nCould the election result have been different had Emhoff managed to convince Taylor Swift to perform a solo performance as part of Harris’s campaign?","summary":"The authors of the new book noted that Doug contacted Swift's lawyer for a performance on election night, but was reportedly turned down.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/doug-emhoff-blamed-yet-again-for-kamala-harris-2024-loss-with-a-taylor-swift-twist","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Untitled-design-2025-07-08T201200.651.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-08 14:46:59","author":"Moupriya,Wikimedia Commons/gage Skidmore/cosmopolitanuk, X/kamala Harris","authors":["Moupriya","Wikimedia Commons/gage Skidmore/cosmopolitanuk, X/kamala Harris"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.088},{"id":339530818,"title":"Top 2024 pollsters start group to challenge bias in media surveys","text":"Membership will be by invitation only and based on “a cumulative record of published public polling with a high degree of accuracy/low error rate,” the group said.\n\n“We don’t need to set any standards given that anyone who is a member or future member of this organization has already established that they are among the most accurate pollsters in America,” said Richard Baris of Big Data Poll and the chairman of the group.\n\nIts spokesman, Trafalgar pollster Robert Cahaly, told Secrets that the four polling organizations have been frustrated by inaccuracy in the industry and surveys that often hide how they are conducted.\n\n“Ours is an alliance for accuracy,” he said, adding, “This group is going to have all kinds of different things it may do, but it mainly is designed to celebrate groups that are accurate and put out information that is more accurate than others do.”\n\nBREAKING: Four of the nation’s most accurate public opinion research firms @BIGDATAPOLL, @InsiderPolling, @Rasmussen_Poll, & @trafalgar_group have announced the formation of The National Association of Independent Pollsters.

He said two other independent pollsters just today asked to become members.\n\nIn the lead up to the 2024 election and since, polls have been divided over President Donald Trump and the GOP control of Washington. Several independent polls, including the four in the new association, have found that Trump is more popular than he was during his first term and that Americans largely like what he is doing.\n\nImagine if these pollsters had actually asked this question, you know, hear me out, BEFORE the election? https://t.co/RjHiXeIaew— Mark Mitchell, Rasmussen Reports (@honestpollster) July 4, 2025\n\nMany media polls, however, have said the opposite and the press play up those polls over the independents.\n\nCahaly said it is unrealistic to think that media and college polls are unbiased since the sponsors are biased, and most are anti-Trump. “We all know media organizations and universities have bias, but somehow never suggest their polling does? No,” he said.\n\nThe new group is something of a counter to the industry’s American Association for Public Opinion Research, which sets standards and ethics.\n\nFor the new group, there is only one standard: getting the results right. “A poll has one of two purposes. It is to reflect the electorate or to affect the electorate. Too many polls out there today seem like they are trying to affect the electorate. And our goal is to reflect it as closely and as perfectly as we can. We’re just four groups that are absolutely obsessed with getting this stuff right. And if that means that we say Trump’s going to win, that’s fine,” Cahaly said.\n\nSEE THE LATEST POLITICAL NEWS AND BUZZ FROM WASHINGTON SECRETS\n\nIn the 2024 election, for example, many media polls showed former Vice President Kamala Harris leading Trump, which even her internal polling never showed. Independent polls, however, showed Trump poised to win, especially in battleground states.\n\nThe most egregious example of a biased media poll was the Selzer & Company survey sponsored by the Des Moines Register showing Harris “leapfrogging” over Trump in the state, 47%-44%.

One year after Biden's consequential debate performance, the first octogenarian president's age has inspired congressional investigations and books detailing his alleged cognitive decline. \"2024: How Trump Retook the White House and the Democrats Lost America,\" is the latest to tackle the inner workings of the Biden administration. The book, released Tuesday by journalists Josh Dawsey of The Wall Street Journal, Tyler Pager of The New York Times and Isaac Arnsdor of The Washington Post, details the influential role Jill Biden played in her husband's administration. 'MASSIVE CONSPIRACY': EX-DNC INSIDER SAYS PARTY WENT TO GREAT LENGTHS TO HIDE BIDEN'S MENTAL DECLINE As Jill Biden gained political influence, so did Anthony Bernal, the first lady's chief of staff and senior advisor and an assistant to the president. INSIDE JILL BIDEN'S POLITICAL RISE AMID HER HUSBAND'S COGNITIVE DECLINE: BOOK He was subpoenaed to testify on July 16 after refusing to appear before the committee investigating the alleged cover-up of Biden's mental decline, which argued that executive privilege did not apply to him. According to the book, Bernal accused Anita Dunn, a veteran Democratic political strategist who served in the Biden and Obama administrations, of being disloyal for pushing for more transparency about the Biden family. There was a \"near-total ban\" on discussing Hunter Biden, the journalists wrote in their new book, as Hunter's federal trial fell in the middle of his father's re-election campaign in June 2024. Jill Biden, with Bernal by her side, went to great lengths to attend Hunter Biden's federal trial, often traveling long distances from overseas trips or campaign events. She attended the first three days of the trial, flew to France to join the president at the D-Day commemoration and then returned to Wilmington less than 24 hours later for the fifth day of the trial. As described in \"2024,\" West Wing staffers were surprised when Jill Biden arrived at the trial. Most senior aides had no idea the first lady planned to attend, revealing her willingness to act independently. But while Jill Biden demonstrated her independence from the White House, Bernal was right there with her leading the East Wing. \"He quickly bonded with Jill Biden and never left her side, becoming unflinchingly loyal to her and using his proximity to her to exert power wherever he decided. It was often unclear if the opinion he was expressing was his own or the first lady’s. Sometimes, when donors or voters asked her questions, Bernal would jump in to answer,\" the authors said. Just as Jill jumped to Hunter's defense during his high-profile trial, she became the president's staunchest supporter following his disastrous debate performance against President Donald Trump. \"Joe isn’t just the right person for the job,\" the first lady said at a fundraiser soon after the debate. \"He’s the only person for the job.\" The book alleges that Jill Biden had always played the \"role of the protective spouse, encouraging the president to eat vegetables, keeping him on time, and questioning staffers when she felt they erred.\" In one such case in January 2022, a Biden aide apologized to the first lady when she questioned why they allowed a press conference to go on for too long, according to the book. As Biden struggled to successfully defend his debate performance, with donors and Democratic politicians growing weary, and \"her husband in the fight of his political life, Jill was making clear: The Democratic Party had to stick with Joe,\" the authors said. After the debate, the Bidens took a pre-planned family trip to Camp David. \"The president was not entertaining the idea of dropping out of the race; he was taking stock of how bad things really were,\" the authors said of Biden's trip to Camp David. The authors described how dropping out \"was not even a consideration\" at Camp David, and how the first lady was part of those in the inner family circle who persuaded Biden to stay in the race, despite mounting pressure from party leaders and donors to step down. Biden huddled with his family in Camp David during the last few days of June, then appeared for debate damage-control interviews on network TV in the weeks following, referring to the debate as a bad night and blaming a cold for his off-night. \"Biden also acknowledged he needed more sleep and said he told his staff that he should not participate in events that start after 8 p.m. But his message was clear: He was staying in the race,\" the authors said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Less than a month after the debate, and one week after an assassination attempt on Trump, Biden announced he was suspending his re-election campaign, and later endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee. Fox News Digital has written extensively dating back to the 2020 presidential campaign about Biden's cognitive decline and his inner circle’s alleged role in covering it up.

Pete Ricketts after his loss in an unexpectedly competitive race against a Republican incumbent last year.\"There's nobody like us in the United States Senate,\" Osborn said in a campaign video announcing the bid Tuesday, touting his background as a mechanic, a Navy veteran, and a registered independent. Osborn, 50, was a political newcomer when he launched his 2024 Senate bid. A union leader who led the strike at Omaha's Kellogg plant in 2021, his campaign received a surge of outside funding that forced Republicans to redouble their efforts in a race that was thought to be an easy win. Osborn went on to significantly outperform Kamala Harris in the deep-red state. But he ultimately lost to Sen. Deb Fischer, the Republican incumbent, by seven percentage points. Now, Osborn is taking on Ricketts, while positioning the bid as representative of a broader fight between the \"billionaire class\" and the working class.\"I'm running for Senate because Congress shouldn't just be a playground for the rich,\" Osborn said. \"Sen. Ricketts has consistently worked for and voted to secure the border and cut taxes for Nebraska workers, families, and seniors,\" Ricketts' campaign spokesman Will Coup said in a statement. \"Dan Osborn is bought and paid for by his liberal, out-of-state, coastal donors. Dan Osborn will side with Chuck Schumer over Nebraska families and vote with Democrats to open the border, hike taxes, and stop the America First agenda.\"Ricketts was appointed to the Senate in 2023 upon former Sen. Ben Sasse's resignation to become president of the University of Florida. Last year, Ricketts handily won his bid in a special election to serve out the remaining two years of Sasse's term. Ricketts, one of the wealthiest members of Congress, is the son of Omaha billionaire Joe Ricketts, the founder of TD Ameritrade, and owner of the Chicago Cubs. Osborn has accused Ricketts of \"trying to buy power in Nebraska,\" while saying that when \"working people need his help,\" it's \"always the same old story: Crickets from Ricketts.\"In his announcement Tuesday, Osborn urged that \"we've got to make things more affordable, secure the border and take on the corruption in Washington,\" echoing the populist message and moderate positions he stressed in his first campaign — like opposition to national abortion restrictions, support for \"reasonable gun safety measures\" and stronger border security.In the 2024 race, Fischer accused her independent challenger of being a \"Democrat in disguise,\" while leaning on an endorsement from President Trump. The president endorsed Ricketts in April, claiming that Osborn is a \"Radical Left Open Border Extremist, who will put our Country, and Safety, LAST,\" while \"Pete, on the other hand, will ALWAYS put Nebraska, and America, FIRST.\"Fisher also backed Ricketts and previewed the race in an April post on X, saying, \"Dan Osborn tried to fool Nebraskans last year. He failed.\"\"Unlike Dan Osborn, Pete Ricketts has nothing to hide,\" Fisher said. \"He's honest, hardworking, and represents Nebraska's values.\"","summary":"Independent Dan Osborn announced another bid to represent Nebraska in the Senate on Tuesday, challenging GOP Sen.

Osborn took millions from Democratic donors, though he denied the endorsement of the Democratic Party. He said he “didn’t ask for that money.”\n\n“First of all, I’ve been a registered independent from the time I could vote,” Osborn told NBC News. “But second of all, I didn’t ask for that money. This time around, I’m not going to ask for it again. The Democrats are going to do what the Democrats do, and Republicans are going to do what the Republicans are going to do. And I just want to show the people that an independent can win in a state like Nebraska or any state, for that matter.”\n\nOsborn said he did not vote for either President Donald Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election, instead opting to write in United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain. He said Fain was one of his “personal heroes.”\n\nTRUMP BACKS RICKETTS AS GOP SENATOR FACES LIKELY OSBORN CHALLENGE\n\nOn the issues, Osborn said he aligns with Trump on border security, has mixed feelings on his trade policies, and would’ve voted against his “big, beautiful bill.”\n\n“It’s going to cut services for people. They’re going to have to cut through so much red tape to continue to have their special-needs kids or whatever the case they’re on these programs for,” he said. “And folks like Ricketts are going to continue to make millions more off of these cuts.

Newsom also visited Nevada, another early-voting state in the party's primary calendar. And Newsom traveled last summer on behalf of Biden to New Hampshire, the state that for a century has held the first-in-the-nation presidential primary. The former president was the Democrats' 2024 standardbearer before dropping out of the race last July following a disastrous debate performance against now-President Donald Trump. Vice President Kamala Harris replaced Biden at the top of the Democratic national ticket. South Carolina, New Hampshire and Nevada are vying for the lead-off position in the next presidential election cycle, and the Democratic National Committee is expected to decide on their 2028 calendar by early 2027. Newsom has long been thought to harbor national ambitions and is considered one of many Democrats who may make a run for the party's 2028 presidential nomination.

The relationships forged this week could possibly pay dividends down the road for Newsom if he eventually decides to launch a 2028 presidential campaign.","summary":"South Carolina GOP leaders tell Gov.

Admittedly, New York needs a new mayor – Eric Adams has been a disaster – but electing Mamdani will simply semaphore to the average American that the left is perfectly happy to stay where it is, outside the White House, still gawping with envy and disbelief through the railings. \n\nEspecially when their new superstar has been publicly endorsed by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as well as that most selfish of far-left politicos, the awful Bernie Sanders. Right now, Gavin Newsom is the most well-known Democrat, but if Mamdani becomes mayor, he will immediately become Donald Trump’s new whipping boy.\n\nHas the left learned nothing? Will it learn nothing?\n\nIn the same way that Einstein’s Parable of Quantum Insanity is almost certainly a fiction – he never said “Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results” – so the American left is behaving as though last year’s election was some kind of fantasy. And because Donald Trump continues to act in such an extreme way, the left continues to frame him as an aberration, almost as though he is existing in a parallel universe, a universe they think they can alter by frowning and shouting like a teenager. \n\nTheir response has been echoed by Elon Musk, who for some bizarre reason thinks that by launching a rival party – whose only policy appears to be a recently acquired but obviously deep-seated dislike of the President – he will immediately become a potential candidate. If Musk means what he says, his only core tenet will be buying advertising, but even that won’t help him win. Many on the left think America will be literally crying out for change after four years of Trump, but without a centrist firebrand to lead the charge, they don’t have a hope. \n\nOne of the most dispiriting things I’ve heard recently was Kamala Harris publicly suggesting she was in something of a professional quandary. Should she, she asked theatrically, try and become the next Governor of California, or should she run again for President? That’s right. Having been ritually humiliated at the polls, having been told in no uncertain terms that her brand of politics wasn’t wanted, and that she was far too extreme for the vast swath of floating voters who hover between New York and California, she seemingly ignores it all and blithely ploughs on as though nothing has happened.\n\nNaturally, many democrats have concluded that Trump’s success was rooted in the idea that for the previous four years, their party simply reflected the priorities of white-collar, college-educated coastal elitists rather than the issues which tend to effect blue-collar families, such as crime, inflation and immigration. But by electing Mamdani they’re basically papering the outside of City Hall with banners proclaiming, ‘Business as Usual’.\n\nAnd that really would be insane, as Einstein almost certainly didn’t say. Watching Elon Musk try and wrestle some of the limelight away from the President will certainly be good sport, but watching the left try and redefine themselves in spite of irrefutable evidence to the contrary could be awfully embarrassing. \n\nThe United States isn’t Glastonbury, and it’s not interested in people from the entertainment industry jumping up and down waving flags and telling them what they want. It’s also not interested in entitled liberals telling them they were wrong. \n\nA few years ago, waiting for a friend, I was standing outside a downtown bar in Austin, Texas, which is probably the most liberal place a person could be between Manhattan and San Francisco. This was during the first Trump administration, when the country was still coming to terms with the newly elected President. Two elderly and rather grumpy gentlemen staggered by me, looking not unlike Statler and Waldorf, the cantankerous old geezers from the Muppets. Like me, they were tourists.\n\n“The thing is, I don’t like him, and I never did, and to be honest with you, I never probably will,” said Statler (I think), with a scowl, “but I sure as hell don’t want somebody else telling me that, especially some rainbow-hatted clown from Austin.”\n\nAs far as I know, Zohran Mamdani doesn’t have a rainbow hat, and I think it would be unfair to call him a clown, especially as the mayoral election isn’t until November. But if you ask me, he’s already doing the devil’s work.\n\nDylan Jones is editor at large at The Standard","summary":"There is already a queue as long as the one conjured up by Saatchi &amp; Saatchi

People just want more and more of this spectacle.” \n\n“What I have seen is a demand that we get ourselves arrested intentionally or allow ourselves to be victims of violence, and … a lot of times that’s coming from economically very secure white people.” \n\nWhat you just read are quotes from a Monday Axios piece on what Democratic lawmakers are hearing from their voters regarding what extremes need to be taken to resist President Donald Trump. And if this strategy sounds crazy, reckless, and potentially fatal, it’s because it is. \n\nBut words are just that, right? Of course, no one would actually, for example, get themselves shot to draw attention to the Trump resistance. \n\nWell, think again. Just hours after that Axios piece went live, a gunman in tactical gear ambushed federal border patrol agents at an annex facility in McAllen, Texas. One officer was struck and rushed to the hospital, where he’s in stable condition and expected to survive. The gunman, whose motives are not yet known, was shot and killed. \n\nIt’s not just Democrat voters who are thoughtlessly attacking federal agents for the crime of doing their jobs by apprehending and deporting violent criminals who entered the country illegally, but elected officials as well. Here’s a sampling from former Democratic vice presidential candidate and current Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who decided that using terminology reserved for the Nazis against Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents was a consequence-free idea. \n\n“Donald Trump’s modern-day Gestapo is scooping folks up off the streets,” Walz said at, of all places, a commencement speech at the University of Minnesota. “They’re in unmarked vans, wearing masks, being shipped off to foreign torture dungeons, no chance to mount a defense, not even a chance to kiss a loved one goodbye, just grabbed up by masked agents, shoved into those vans, and disappeared.”\n\nThis person actually came close to being one heartbeat away from the presidency. Think about that. He uses the word “Gestapo” to compare ICE agents to Nazi state secret police under Hitler, and not a hint of condemnation came from the editorial boards of the New York Times or Washington Post. This gives such rhetoric tacit approval. \n\nIt’s not just Walz spewing this garbage.\n\n“It’s time to put Trump in a bullseye,” said former President Joe Biden just days before Trump was shot in Butler, Pennsylvania. \n\n“It’s on us to recognize the threat [Trump] poses,” said former Vice President Kamala Harris after being installed as the Democratic Party nominee without one vote from the public.\n\n“Trump is destructive to our democracy and … he has to be eliminated,” said Rep. Dan Goldman (D-NY). \n\n“Trump needs to be shot,” Delegate from the U.S. Virgin Islands Stacey Plaskett said before correcting herself by saying she meant “stopped.” \n\n“They’re still going to have to go out and put a bullet in Donald Trump. And that’s a fact,” said Lincoln Project founder Rick Wilson in 2015. \n\n“[Trump] is a threat to our democracy of the kind that we have not seen,” said former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA).\n\n“This is America. This is not the Soviet Union. We’re not behind the Iron Curtain. This is not the 1930s. And every single [ICE agent], no matter what it takes, no matter how long it takes, will, of course, be identified,” said House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY).\n\nAlmost one year ago, the first of two assassination attempts was almost successful against Trump. In the second instance, the gunman, Ryan Routh, literally quoted Democratic lawmakers almost verbatim before his attempt outside of Trump International Golf Club in Palm Beach, Florida.\n\n“DEMOCRACY is on the ballot and we cannot lose,” Routh wrote on Facebook in 2024. \n\n“Make no mistake: democracy is on the ballot,” Biden said before dropping out of the 2024 presidential race. \n\nICE agents are also being targeted at an alarming rate. According to the Department of Homeland Security, assaults against ICE officers and federal agents are up a whopping 690% compared to the same time last year. And not one Democrat has come out to say, “Let these men do their jobs. Enough is enough.” \n\nInstead, these are some lawmakers purposely getting arrested to drum up sympathy while making ICE look like the bad guys. The lowlight came last month when Sen. Alex Padilla (D-CA) was handcuffed for storming a press conference being held by DHS Secretary Kristi Noem. Agents had no choice but to restrain Padilla and arrest him before letting him out of custody. \n\nPadilla, of course, could have simply asked to meet with Noem privately following her press conference, but that would require acting professionally as a sitting senator. Instead, they engaged in arrest pornography. Padilla knew he’d get this kind of treatment from publications such as the Los Angeles Times. \n\n“First they came for the immigrants, then they came for our Latino senator,” blared the headline in California’s most prominent paper. And, of course, the word “illegal” was purposely omitted before “immigrants” to imply ICE was actually seeking to deport those in the country legally. \n\nAcross the country in New York, 33-year-old socialist Zohran Mamdani runs on a platform that includes removing ICE from the city entirely.\n\n“[Mamdani] will ensure our immigrant New Yorkers are protected by strengthening our sanctuary city apparatus: getting ICE out of all City facilities and ending any cooperation,” his platform reads. \n\nAgain, “illegal” is left out here. And what does “ending any cooperation” mean, exactly? How will Mamdani get ICE out of all city facilities except by force, since no legal recourse can remove them? \n\nThere is little hope that Democratic leaders will do the right thing and push back on their voters who no longer want decorum in favor of mob rule, the Roman coliseum, and blood on the streets instead. \n\nMORAL OBJECTORS TO MEDICAID REFORM FAIL TO IDENTIFY A BETTER MORAL ALTERNATIVE\n\nThe country is at a tipping point here in the Summer of 2025, with the Left willing to tip the whole thing over to show they are the guardians of democracy. \n\nOr something…","summary":"&#8220;We can&#8217;t keep following norms of decorum.&#8221; &#8220;Some [voters] have suggested … what we really need to do is be willing to get shot.&#8221;  &#8220;Our own base is telling us that what we&#8217;re doing is not good enough … [that] there needs to be blood to grab the attention of the press and the public.&#8221; [&#8230;]","url":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/in_focus/3464444/attacks-on-federal-agents-skyrocket-dangerous-media-democratic-rhetoric/","image":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/AP25027710583865.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-08 12:00:00","author":"Joe Concha","authors":["Joe Concha"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.175},{"id":339469790,"title":"The MAGA 'mating call' is taking dating apps by storm. So WILL POTTER and ALEXA CIMINO put it to the test... and were stunned by the results","text":"Young Trump supporters have started turning dating apps into battlegrounds, opening with a bold, sometimes polarizing pickup line: 'Hi, I'm MAGA.'\n\nIt's called the 'MAGA mating call,' and it's not exactly subtle.\n\nSo, we decided to try it.\n\nNot because we're rally-hopping, red-hat-wearing diehards - we're not - but because as journalists, we were curious.\n\nDating in America today is a blood sport, and political identity is often treated as the ultimate dealbreaker.\n\nTo test out this super direct dating strategy, two of our Daily Mail reporters matched with a range of New Yorkers - conservative, liberal and apolitical - and started conversations with the same line: 'Hi, I'm MAGA.'\n\nOur male reporter, Will Potter, matched with a total of roughly 10 women on Hinge, while our female reporter, Alexa Cimino, matched with roughly 80 men across Hinge and Bumble.\n\nWill's matches proved less than enthused by his Trump-inspired message, and Alexa's turned out to be a completely baffling display of versatility.\n\nOn my end of the apps, women were not impressed.\n\nOverall, I sent the cold opener to around 10 women on Hinge after already matching in some way (sometimes, they made the first move; other times, I did).\n\nSome unmatched me immediately after I told them I was part of the MAGA movement. Other responses ranged from frustration and anger to sheer confusion.\n\nOne woman, a future lawyer, was especially offended that the message came from a Brit. She snapped back, 'I'm about to give you a lesson British boy. We don't joke about that in the states!!!'\n\nIt was about what I expected. According to 2024 data from Gallup, liberalism has grown more popular among young women over the past several decades. However, President Donald Trump's 2024 victory shined a light on a rising population of conservative women in 2025.\n\nAmong the women who didn't immediately nix our connection, one just wrote, 'Ok???'\n\nAnother called it a 'crazy opener.' \n\nOne girl from Brooklyn hit me with a deadpan, 'Oh great.'\n\nSo I tried something else.\n\nI followed up with Kamala Harris' now-iconic coconut tree speech, the one where she says you 'exist in the context of all in which you live and what came before you.'\n\nShe approvingly responded, 'Period.'\n\nI was able to test this line out on a larger sample than my counterpart. \n\nOverall, I sent the message to roughly 80 men across 2 apps after already matching with them in some way.\n\nAs the old saying goes, 'Men pair widely, women pair wisely' - so it wasn't necessarily surprising to see the range of responses I received.\n\nSo while many of Will's prospects fizzled fast, mine… didn't. \n\nI found my matches fell into six categories.\n\nThe no-nonsense MAGA bachelors\n\nSome of the men were all in. These were the ones whose profiles either openly declared their conservative views or strategically skipped politics altogether.\n\nOne man replied, 'Thank God. I need a conservative woman in my life.' \n\nAnother introduced himself with, 'Hello, MAGA. I'm America First,' then later followed up with, 'Hope you haven't disappeared faster than that Ukrainian aid money.'\n\nA third told me, 'In that case, you're also a dream come true.' \n\nThese guys were practically on one knee after a three-word, Trump-inspired opener.\n\nThe thirst responders \n\nThen there were the men who didn't care what I said, as long as they thought it might get them laid.\n\nOne kicked things off with a refined opener of, 'Hi, you're hot.'\n\nAnother skipped all pretense and asked, 'Are you also coming over later too? Lol.'\n\nA guy claiming to be in the FBI wrote, 'I'm whatever you want me to be'.\n\nThese weren't men engaging with an idea, they were thirsty and eager - willing to agree with literally anything if it meant they had a chance.\n\nIt didn't matter if I said I was MAGA, Marjorie Taylor Greene or Mussolini reincarnated - they just saw a woman and said yes.\n\nOne guy took a softer approach than some, replying, 'I'm not MAGA, but I think you're really pretty.'\n\nAnd another said, 'You are making America great again looking that pretty haha.'\n\nThe 'Sure, whatever' crowd\n\nWhile some men were confused, others were indifferent, but most just didn't seem to care.\n\nOne person I matched with admitted, 'It's not a problem at all. I kind of like him too,' with a laughing emoji.\n\nAnother guy said, 'I don't like some of his policies but I don't really care haha.' \n\nAnother offered, 'MAGA is cool. I don't mind.'\n\nThey treated the statement like I'd just said I prefer oat milk, not that I support the most polarizing political figure in modern history. But it wasn't open-mindedness, it was indifference.\n\nOne guy said he didn't care about my political views at all, as long as I wasn't into mainstream Bollywood - not exactly at the top of my personal dealbreaker list, but noted.\n\nA surprising number of men parroted the call back like a strange mating ritual: 'Hi MAGA, I'm [insert name here]'.\n\nIt wasn't flirting, it was mirroring. Like they thought that by matching my tone, they could avoid actually saying anything real.\n\nThe overthinkers\n\nI couldn't believe how many political essays I received in response to a four-letter acronym.\n\nSome matches felt compelled to submit their entire ideological manifesto before even saying hi.\n\nOne man launched into a TED Talk about how 'both sides are corrupt,' ultimately concluding he'd 'rather Trump than anyone else.'\n\nMeanwhile, another claimed he was an Iraqi Chaldean conservative who isn't 'really political' right now because he's focusing on 'career and self development.'\n\nThis was the most revealing group. These were the guys whose profiles loudly declared their liberal values - or even mocked conservatives - and yet had no issue cozying up to a MAGA girl.\n\nOne guy had 'liberal' in his bio but still responded, 'I support Trump too ;)'\n\nMatt listed 'Fox News is Cocomelon for adult men' as his most controversial opinion, and then sent me 'Hi MAGA, I'm Matt.'\n\nWhen I told my guy friends about this, they weren't surprised. In fact, they admitted they'd done the same.\n\n'Oh yeah,' one said. 'I've told girls I'm more liberal than I am just to get laid.'\n\nThe honest few \n\nA few men held firm. \n\nOne asked, 'Does that mean your jokes aren't funny?'\n\nAnd another said, 'I'm a Biden supporter,' and didn't budge. \n\nA few just said 'Okay and???' - clearly confused as to why I opened with politics at all.\n\nOur findings\n\nPerhaps the most fascinating part of the exercise was of the 80 conversations Alexa started with that three-word greeting, only one man unmatched her.\n\nThe interaction was quick, efficient, and honest. Upon seeing the phrase, he said, 'My condolences,' and swiftly unmatched Alexa on Bumble. \n\nWhile many of the women Will matched with called it quits after the slogan was put to use, Alexa found a surprising number of men were willing to abandon their supposed values the second a woman with decent profile pictures and a hint of confidence slid into their DMs.","summary":"Young Trump supporters have started turning dating apps into battlegrounds, opening with a bold, sometimes polarizing pickup line.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14809953/MAGA-mating-call-dating-apps-secret.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/17/17/99432831-0-Politics_have_become_a_point_of_contention_among_daters_Stock_ph-a-12_1750179449947.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-08 11:55:10","author":"Alexa Cimino,Editor,Will Potter","authors":["Alexa Cimino","Editor","Will Potter"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.134},{"id":339466022,"title":"Donald Trump Drops Below Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton in Popularity Ranking","text":"President Donald Trump's popularity has fallen below that of former President Joe Biden and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, according to a recently released YouGov ranking the most popular politicians in the second quarter of 2025.Newsweek has reached out to the White House outside of regular working hours via email for comment.Why It MattersThe president has been engaged on multiple fronts, some of which have proven divisive within the electorate, including the passage of the \"big, beautiful bill\" or his tariffs policy. Naturally, a sitting president often serves as an open target for criticism, while leaders of the past tend to benefit from the fact that they're simply no longer in charge. What To KnowIn the Q2 rankings, Trump ranks as the 17th most popular with 37 percent of adults having a positive opinion of the president. Vice President JD Vance ranks above Trump, at 14th on the list, at 38 percent.Hillary Clinton ranks sixth on the list, with 47 percent, while Biden is ninth with 42 percent.Former President Jimmy Carter, who died in December 2024, ranked number one.

There are too many crazies running around with guns.” Despite his social-media prowess, charm, and a remarkable grassroots campaign, the democratic socialist is an underdog who will face intense opposition.The “boy” she was referring to is the charismatic Zohran Kwame Mamdani, who catapulted to fame after winning in the Democratic primary for Mayor of New York City. It was a stunning upset. Still, while his rivals may be unimpressive, the path for Mamdani, who has many critics even within his own party, remains steep. Anything can happen between now and 4 November 2025, the date of the mayoral election. But Mamdani is a fighter, and his infectious energy and magnetism won’t cease to propel him, continuing to inspire young Democrats and progressives who have been disheartened by their party’s unpopularity and stumbles since Kamala Harris lost the election to Donald Trump. As Mamdani said, “In the words of Nelson Mandela: it always seems impossible until it’s done.” Mamdani’s rise seems well-timed. With the midterms coming up next year, the mayoral election could turn out to be a bellwether, although it’s true that New York City is different from much of the country. Also in 2026, when the US commemorates its 250th anniversary, Indian Americans will mark the 80th anniversary of another landmark event that benefitted them.In 1946, the year that bridged the end of World War II and the dawn of India’s independence, President Harry Truman signed the Luce-Celler Act, which granted US citizenship rights to Indian and Filipino residents. Immigrant activists played a big role in its passage, but the bill was also a recognition of anti-colonial sentiments and Asia’s contribution to the Allied war effort. As Trump 2.0 threatens to end birthright citizenship, the 1946 bill—a reminder of what immigrant activists could achieve even when the odds were against them—is worth celebrating. The Luce-Celler Act, besides offering naturalisation, allowed 100 Indians and 100 Filipinos to immigrate every year. Those were modest numbers, to be sure, but this opening of the door was a big change from the Asiatic Barred Zone, which had shut out Asians for 35 years. When Truman signed the 1946 bill, there were only about 4000 Indians living in the US. Mamdani, like his filmmaker mother and academic father, was born outside the US. “His identity as an immigrant was very meaningful, especially when immigrant communities are being grabbed off the streets,” the head of Working Families Party told The New York Times after his recent victory.In the last primary debate, Mamdani said, also meaningfully, “I am Donald Trump’s worst nightmare.” New York: Zohran Mamdani Has Surprised Everyone With His Challenge. Can He Win?Whatever misgivings potential supporters have about his “democratic socialist” approach to solving New York’s pressing issues, one thing is clear: Mamdani is fearless. And he stands up for the rights of immigrants. In the Trump 2.0 era, arguably, that could be the main draw of his campaign. A 2024 mayoral report notes that 60% of New Yorkers are immigrants or children of immigrants. It explains, in no small part, why his campaign resonates so widely in the city. Mamdani is the latest in a line of Indians who fought on behalf of immigrants. None played a bigger role in the Luce-Celler Act’s passage than JJ Singh, whom The New Yorker dubbed “One Man Lobby” in its profile. A businessman who served as the president of India League of America, Singh was one of only two South Asians who stood in the Oval Office when Truman signed the bill in 1946 (the other South Asian, MOA Baig, joined Pakistan’s embassy in DC). Sabrina Singh, JJ Singh’s granddaughter, served in the Biden administration, most recently as the Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary. Ironically, JJ Singh, who went back to India in 1959, didn’t become a US citizen. But Dalip Singh Saund did become one in 1949. There were other South Asian immigrant activists in that era—such as Tarakanath Das and Mubarek Ali, to name a couple—but it was Saund, the holder of a PhD from the University of California, Berkeley, who rose to prominence, becoming the first Asian American to be elected to the House of Representatives. This was back in 1957. Even more impressively, Saund won two consecutive terms and lost his third election bid only after suffering a stroke in 1962. In comparison, having six Indian Americans in the House today may not seem as extraordinary. For one thing, they’re all Democrats, as was Saund. Bobby Jindal is the only Indian American Republican to have served in the House. Kamala Harris, another Democrat, served in the Senate. WebQoof Recap: Misinformation Around Israel-Iran Conflict, Zohran Mamdani & MoreAlthough the current period is distant from Saund’s time, it presents its own set of problems for minority and non-white candidates like Mamdani. As authoritarianism rises in the US, the far right and the GOP—which, in many ways, has become a far-right party—directs increasingly vicious attacks against them if they’re Democrats. “A lot of people are saying he’s here illegally,” Trump said, falsely questioning Mamdani’s legal status. “We’re going to look at everything.” Mamdani is a naturalised US citizen. Remember what Trump had said about Obama and Harris when they were running for office? That’s not all. Mamdani has to contend with Hindu right-wingers who, like right-wingers in the US, play the “terrorism” card.These crude attacks, while predictable, only add to the xenophobia Mamdani faces in the mayoral contest. Some in India have denounced him for identifying as a Muslim! It’s as if his broader family background and upbringing, cultural milieu, and personal belief should be trumped by the fact that he has a Hindu mother, even if his father is Muslim. His parents, Mira Nair and Mahmood Mamdani, are secular above all. Saund and JJ Singh, as Sikhs who didn’t wear turbans, were minority Indians as well.However, that didn’t stop them from being embraced by the larger Indian community, or indeed Sikhs who retained their turbans. Saund, notwithstanding the discrimination and obstacles he faced, didn’t have to deal with death threats and gun violence. American civilians today own around 500 million firearms. In the 1950s, according to one estimate, that figure was just 54 million.In Saund’s era, moreover, the brown minority in the US was so small and powerless that the white majority had no reason to feel insecure. Now we live in a world that’s been upended by nativism, authoritarian populism, and demagoguery. In his recent book, The World After Gaza: A History, Pankaj Mishra touches on these changes, which didn’t happen suddenly. “It has become particularly treacherous in the West, where the steady erosion of the inherited privileges of whiteness, and assertiveness of previously marginal peoples, has panicked many individuals and institutions into crude and reckless exertions of arbitrary power,” he writes.“This panic, caused by the spectre of impoverished and needy masses of non-Western ancestry, publicly expressed fears about immigration, Islamic fundamentalism and population explosions, or through a racialised vocabulary (‘welfare queens', ‘super-predators’), has been building up for some decades.” Pankaj MishraIt’s a dark time, and many would say the 'American Dream' is turning into an 'American Nightmare'. But Zohran Mamdani, to his credit, is not backing down. “His statements don’t just represent an attack on our democracy but an attempt to send a message to every New Yorker who refuses to hide in the shadows: if you speak up, they will come for you,” Mamdani said in response to Trump’s verbal assault. “We will not accept this intimidation.” (Murali Kamma is a managing editor and writer based in Atlanta, Georgia.

Hundreds of thousands of people responded and more than 80% answered “yes”. \n\nThe middle is still overlooked in US politics. This is because there is a perception that Republicans and Democrats have nothing in common, and therefore no issue will win support from both centrist Republicans and Democrats. \n\nPolarisation is problematic as it is linked to “democratic backsliding” – the use of underhand tactics in political processes. Worst of all, it poses a threat to democracy. \n\nMany think that polarisation is fuelled by echo chambers created on social media platforms. These only expose people to beliefs similar to their own. \n\nHowever, I study how narratives emerge on social media, and ways to investigate them. My work has two aims: first, to identify political issues that are likely to cross party lines, and a wider goal of exploring the role of social media in mitigating, rather than exacerbating, levels of polarisation.\n\nGet your news from actual experts, straight to your inbox. Sign up to our daily newsletter to receive all The Conversation UK’s latest coverage of news and research, from politics and business to the arts and sciences.\n\nEarlier this year, for example, I sorted through 12,000 posts from Republican and Democrat voters on subreddits (online forums discussing specific topics). Using a technique I developed in my PhD research, I analysed attitudes to contested political issues around the time of Trump’s inauguration. Like other researchers, I am finding that there are things both sides often agree on, and that not every issue splits neatly across party lines.\n\nAlthough it’s a complex topic, people from both parties are worried about levels of free speech on social media. According to my work and other sources, some Democrats accuse TikTok of censoring hashtags such as #FreeLuigi (a reference to Luigi Mangione, accused of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO, Brian Thompson). \n\nMeanwhile, some Republicans are saying they are flooded with what they see as left-wing content pushed by the algorithms. Despite their differences, Republicans and Democrats agree that social media platforms need to be more transparent about the way they work.\n\nBoth sides worry about the rise of authoritarianism and the growing negative influence of artificial intelligence in shaping the US’s future. There is a sense among some members of the two parties that the real enemies aren’t each other, but powerful corporations who hold too much power.\n\nPeople on both sides of the political divide can be distrustful of tech companies and big businesses, where billionaires have power regardless of who’s in charge. Divisions of “up v down” could be alternatives to seeing divisions as “left v right”.\n\nSome people are worried about the creation of a massive database of citizens’ details, and how their details could be used, or abused. Recently Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene said she would have opposed Trump’s “big, beautiful, bill”, had she read the AI clause thoroughly. The clause stops states from passing laws to regulate AI systems for the next ten years. \n\nWhat do people agree on?\n\nOn the topic of protecting democracy, there are some suggestions that many Republicans and Democrats agree this is important, and under threat. In my study, some Republican and Democrat voters object to the possibility of Trump having a third term, aligning with the findings of several recent polls on the subject, and even among Trump’s most loyal support groups.\n\nBoth Republicans and Democrats want “the best” leaders who could get things done fast and efficiently. But it would appear that people on both sides are concerned about the “slash-and-burn” way that Doge (the Department for Government Efficiency, the new agency tasked with cutting federal spending) is working. \n\nAlso, deciding who is the best leader isn’t always about agreeing with specific policies. Instead, it’s about delivering decisive, efficient action. Even Republicans who don’t back everything Trump is doing say that at least he is doing something, especially in relation to immigration.\n\nMany Republicans criticise the left, and former Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris in particular, but for unclear messaging, as much as any one policy. They (and others) put her loss down to a lack of direction and clarity on key issues (among other things). This probably resulted in failing to win votes from independents and moderate Republicans and many Democrats are frustrated that the party still hasn’t addressed this. \n\nResearch suggests that Democrat and Republican voters often agree that polarisation causes gridlock and prevents progress, but believe voices from the middle are not being heard. Some Republicans and Democrats also share a concern that both parties are more focused on fighting each other than on solving problems, with 86% of Americans believing this. \n\nSome Republican voters in the posts I am analysing suggest that working together to get things done would be positive, supporting findings from the US and abroad. Other important factors rather than political party, such as religion or family or everyday life experiences can bring people from both sides together.\n\nSo, Americans might not be as divided as one might think. Levels of polarisation feel high but this could be skewed by the extreme views of a minority on both sides. And it isn’t helped by some sensationalist media reporting. \n\nLots of people get their news from social media platforms which reward and monetise engagement. Posts that fuel division are often the most visible, but they rarely tell the whole story. Divisive views are also often shared by those who are themselves the most polarised.\n\nLike Musk’s online poll, research is starting to suggest that there is still a sizeable moderate middle in the US today who are open to compromise through clear messaging. These voters can make all the difference, especially if parties can frame issues in ways that appeal across the divide. With the 2026 midterm elections on the horizon, both sides might want to listen to them more.","summary":"Americans of both parties are worried about Trump having a third term, and have other shared concerns.","url":"https://theconversation.com/there-are-many-things-americans-voters-agree-on-from-fears-about-technology-to-threats-to-democracy-258440","image":"https://images.theconversation.com/files/675682/original/file-20250620-56-q6sulu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=1252%2C0%2C4995%2C2497&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-08 11:36:43","author":"Digital Speech Lab,Emma Connolly,Research Fellow,UCL","authors":["Digital Speech Lab","Emma Connolly","Research Fellow","UCL"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"AU","sentiment":0.088},{"id":339460540,"title":"Barron Trump's love life revealed: US President's son has a mysterious girlfriend amid college life?

What To Do About the $16M CBS Is Paying Donald Trump | Opinion","text":"Incredibly, it's happened. In broad daylight, amid credible claims of corruption, CBS has agreed to pay President Donald Trump's library $16 million for Federal Communication Commission (FCC) approval of a broadcast license transfer. The courts should do something about it.Don't listen to those saying it isn't so. It's true that Trump's lawsuit doesn't say, \"please pay me a bribe.\" But it may as well have. It accuses CBS of unfair trade practices for a small edit Trump said made Kamala Harris look good. It's also true that CBS doesn't admit to paying a bribe. CBS said it was settling to protect its reputation and save legal costs. But it also said the settlement will allow CBS parent Paramount to \"focus on their core objectives.\"That objective, as anyone who can count to 16 should know, is to secure FCC approval to transfer the CBS news license from Paramount to its would-be purchaser, Skydance. Right now, its idling at the FCC under the control of its chairman, Trump loyalist Brendan Carr, who was also presides over an FCC complaint identical to the Trump court claim.Watch. Now the complaint will go away, and the license will be granted. Carr will probably say he and Donald Trump never spoke about it. Maybe that's true, maybe not. But of course, they didn't have to. Carr has heard all he needs through the media. CBS wants approval. Trump wants cash.The lawyers may also say they didn't discuss the license during settlement negotiations. Maybe they just talked about the need to \"restore good will\" between CBS and Trump and other coded things like that. Who knows? But we know what they were after, and so did they.How can we be so sure? It's because, as lawyers, they had to know that in the history of American courts there have been few cases that have been bigger stinkers than this one. If a politician in a country guaranteeing free speech can successfully sue the media for making his opponent look too good then we should be suing our neighbors for favoring other neighbors over ourselves and suing politicians for making an utter mess of the country. Nothing's too far out.Ask yourself: Would CBS have paid this money if Trump had lost the election? Of course not, and that and the lawsuit's absurdity tell us the money can only be a bribe. As Sherlock Holmes might have put it, with the other reasons for the settlement being impossible, the remaining possibility is the real reason. CBS and Trump know this is so, no matter how slippery and mob-like they have been in avoiding the \"B\" word.So, it's corruption. But, \"c'mon\" you might say, hasn't Washington always been corrupt? Well, \"c'mon,\" right back at you. Everything is—a little. Corruption in government is like water—or sewage—filling a glass. A member of Congress calls a federal agency to help a friend—or a donor. Pour a little in. A senator's son gets a good paying job working for a defense contractor. Pour in a little more. A senator takes expensive gifts from people doing business with the government. The glass overflows. Former Senator Robert Menendez goes to jail.Now aim a firehose at the glass and let it rip. That's the Trump level of corruption.When Trump cut Vietnam's tariffs by more than half last week Vietnam had just approved $1.5 billion of projects for the Trump Organization. Have you forgotten the $400 million plane? The meme coins? The White House crypto coin auction? Millions from Meta to settle a bogus lawsuit? Millions from ABC to settle a bogus lawsuit? Millions to Melania from Jeff Bezos? Watches? Guitars? Bibles? All of it to benefit Trump personally.Let it stop with CBS. The judge should delay action on any motion to dismiss the case until the FCC decision. If it's favorable to CBS, the judge should hear testimony under oath about the negotiations for purposes of policing the ethics of the lawyers involved with the case.

Will right turn last?","text":"For the last eight months, ever since Donald Trump walloped Kamala Harris to reclaim the presidency, Democratic politicians, political interest groups and media pundits of all stripes have debated what happened and why.\n\nDeep dives into who voted, and sometimes why, have generally concluded that Harris lost decisive ground — compared to Joe Biden’s 2020 unseating of Trump — among younger male voters, especially Latinos and Black Californians, and could not generate enough support among other demographic groups, such as women, to offset the losses.\n\n“Overall, Harris performed six points worse among men than Biden did,” an extensive analysis by the Cook Political Report declared. “But that falloff was significantly more pronounced among Latino men (-12) and Black men (-7). Among white men without a college degree — a group that is traditionally the least friendly to Democrats — the slippage was least dramatic (-3).\n\n“Despite the historic nature of her candidacy as the first woman of color to be nominated for president, women greeted that fact with more of a shrug,” Cook continued. “Harris’ vote share among women was basically the same as the share Biden got in 2020, except for a noticeable decline in support from Latinas. She also slightly underperformed Biden among Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) women (-4) and failed to do any better with Black women than Biden did.”\n\nCalifornia, one of the nation’s bluest states, was not immune to the political hemorrhage that doomed Harris’ campaign, even though she is a Californian who was the state’s attorney general and a U.S. senator before becoming Biden’s vice president.\n\nVoters in 10 California counties which had backed Biden against Trump in 2020, switched to Trump last year, and a new analysis of California’s vote indicates that the state saw the same dynamics as the nation as a whole.\n\n“After years of declining shares of registered voters selecting Republican as their party registration, young Californians have begun to move towards the Republican party in recent election years while older Californians continue to move away,” the analysis by the Center for Inclusive Democracy at the University of Southern California declares.\n\n“Young registered voters of all racial and ethnic groups saw notably larger shifts towards the Republican party compared to their older counterparts. Latino youth, however, saw particularly large growth in Republican party registration between presidential elections.”\n\nIt continued, “While Vice President Kamala Harris received 58.5% of all votes cast in California’s 2024 general election, President Donald Trump received 38.3% of the votes, the smallest difference in the vote by party (20.2 percentage points) since before 2008.”\n\nWhile Republicans obviously gained ground in California last year — and did reasonably well in congressional and legislative elections — the new data generate two questions: Why did it happen, and what does it bode for the future?\n\n“Inflation is probably the biggest thing,” Eric McGhee, a political analyst for the Public Policy Institute of California, said during a webinar to introduce the study.\n\nThat comports with the widespread belief that sharp increases in the cost of living during the Biden-Harris administration were a big factor in the pro-Trump shift, as younger voters felt the pinch of inflation more than their elders.\n\nMake no mistake. California is still a very blue state. It’s highly unlikely that Republicans, who were once dominant themselves, would regain enough ground to again award the state’s electoral votes to a GOP presidential candidate in the foreseeable future.\n\nHowever, were the rightward surge of young voters of color to continue, for whatever reason, as baby boomer Democrats exit the political stage, California politics could become a lot less predictable and a lot healthier.\n\nDan Walters is a CalMatters columnist.","summary":"Inflation was biggest factor for Californians voting against Harris, mirroring dynamics nationally, new study shows.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/07/08/walters-california-trump-2024-kamala-harris/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2212828636.jpg?w=1024&h=740","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-08 10:15:13","author":"Dan Walters","authors":["Dan Walters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.262},{"id":339469082,"title":"Battle over SALT exposes that a GOP trifecta doesn’t mean party unity","text":"“The thing with MAGA is it’s typically not dug in ideological positions,” GOP strategist Jason Roe said. “They are often a whimsical reflection of Trump’s position on that day. I think he probably is amused by seeing these two caucuses arguing over who has more fidelity to his cause.”\n\nThe fight over SALT, in particular, exposed the GOP’s Achilles heel: With a small House majority, passing major legislative change is not easy, and the party is not likely to get everything it wants.\n\n“Republicans in Washington are the dog that caught the car: It’s easy to bark at the car and chase it, but once you catch the car, when you do that, is a whole other question,” said Peter Loge, a political scientist and the director of the School of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University.\n\n“And the Republicans are discovering what the Democrats discovered when they controlled all three branches of government: They can get some things done, but they can’t get everything done,” Loge continued.\n\nAfter more than 24 hours of debate, negotiations, and record-breaking votes and “magic minutes,” the House passed the “big, beautiful bill” with only two Republican dissenters. The road to passage was filled with roadblocks, as fiscal hawks were angered that the Senate deviated from the budget framework. It required extensive deliberations across Wednesday and Thursday, as House leadership and the White House worked to sway holdouts to a “yes” vote.\n\nBut one voting bloc emerged victorious: SALT GOP lawmakers received a $40,000 cap that they negotiated in “good faith” with leadership. Though the cap sunsets after five years and snaps back to $10,000, the quadrupled cap was enough to bring blue state Republicans to a “yes” on the “big, beautiful bill.”\n\nThough the last two days were focused on fiscal hawks, it did not discount the hours, weeks, and months SALT Republicans spent putting pressure on congressional leadership to take their demands seriously.\n\nThey argued that Republicans would not even have a trifecta if it were not for members such as Rep. Mike Lawler (R-NY), who won a district carried by former Vice President Kamala Harris last cycle, and that the GOP needs their support to keep that majority.\n\n“To me, it’s a binary issue,” Rep. Nick LaLota (R-NY) said in an interview. “Either I deliver enough SALT to make my middle-class constituents whole, or I don’t, and the latter simply is not an option.”\n\nSALT became a major component of reconciliation negotiations due to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act expiring at the end of the year, which would eliminate the $10,000 cap and the tax cuts.\n\nWhile the right flank of the party was expected to be the House rabblerousers and thorns in Speaker Mike Johnson’s (R-LA) side, the more centrist SALT Caucus Republicans emerged as a formidable opponent to leadership with a clear message: We want the SALT cap raised, or we’re out.\n\n“We SALT Republicans have the ultimate walk-away position,” LaLota said.\n\nAhead of the vote, fiscal hawks had blasted the Senate for trying to jam the reconciliation bill through the lower chamber and accused the SALT Caucus of working against Trump’s agenda.\n\n“At the end of the day, I’m trying to do what’s best and really fighting for his agenda,” said Rep. Eric Burlison (R-MO), a Freedom Caucus member. “We’re doing everything we can to get the most of what he’s asked for.”\n\n“The people really are fighting Trump are the people that want to raise SALT deductions and are fighting all the cuts in the Green New Deal program,” Burlison added.\n\nLawler said in an interview that his fellow House colleagues needed to come to terms with a few “political realities.”\n\n“Unlike 2017, where we had a very large majority, and you know, people in districts like mine could be just disregarded,” Lawler said. “That’s not the case this time around.”\n\nOne of the SALT Republicans’ swords to wield was that the SALT cap has the blessing of the White House. Many meetings were held over the last few months with officials, and the centrist GOP lawmakers have attributed the bill’s success in passing the House in May to a successful give-and-take from leadership, the administration, and the SALT caucus.\n\nBut more simply, SALT is one of the things Trump campaigned on, said Rep. Andrew Garbarino (R-NY), the SALT Caucus co-chairman.\n\nGarbarino, along with other centrist colleagues, LaLota, Lawler, and Rep. Nicole Malliotakis (R-NY), had a tough sell to red-state colleagues who did not want to reward New York for high local taxes by giving blue-state residents a federal tax deduction. They pushed back with a double-taxation argument.\n\n“You’re taxing people’s taxes, which I never thought was a Republican belief, but I guess some of my colleagues in the Senate think it is,” Garbarino said.\n\nMalliotakis called the argument that SALT would subsidize New York or California a “fallacy.”\n\n“What we’ve asked for was something that was reasonable and fair, that focused on middle-class families and is supported by the Republican principle of allowing taxpayers to keep more of their hard-earned money,” Malliotakis said.\n\n“The people who are being subsidized are the ones who are receiving refundable tax credits, which are still in this bill,” she added. “So, if we’re going to be doing that, then we should be doing the SALT relief.”\n\nSen. Markwayne Mullin (R-OK) served as a bridge between the blue-state Republicans and the upper chamber. House Republicans expressed appreciation that the Oklahoma senator took the matter seriously and that the Senate adhered to the House’s deal, a blow to the wishes of fiscal hawks.\n\n“We are just as fiscally conservative as anybody is, including the Freedom Caucus members,” Rep. Young Kim (R-CA), the SALT Caucus co-chairwoman, said in an interview. “And I appreciate them. I respect them. However, this is an issue that we ran on, and we got what we needed, and without us, if this SALT is not fixed the way we fixed it and negotiated and debated, we’re not going to have the House majority.”\n\nRoe said the collision of SALT and heavy spending cuts is a “problem of their own creation,” noting that it would not likely have happened if Republicans had instead taken the two-bill approach pitched earlier this year.\n\n“You split these bills up, you could pass the bill that had cuts, and you could keep the conservatives on board, and then you could have a bill that had SALT that you could keep the swing-state or blue-state members on,” Roe said. “Together, that’s an impossibility.”\n\nINDEPENDENCE DAY BLITZ: HOW TRUMP AND THE GOP TRIFECTA SEALED A MAJOR LEGISLATIVE VICTORY\n\nJohnson, despite having many voices in his ear, had taken the SALT issue seriously. Because he could only afford to lose three votes to pass legislation along party lines, the speaker urged the Senate not to modify the SALT cap because of the “delicate balance” in the House.\n\n“It’s a big part of the bill, and it’s what’s necessary to cobble together the 217 votes that I must have to get the final product done into the president’s desk,” Johnson said in a TV appearance. “They’re playing with fire over there. I’ve tried to explain to them, this is not a game.”","summary":"Intraparty squabbles over whether to raise the state and local tax cap revealed a harsh truth for Republicans: Just because there is a GOP trifecta does not mean all of its members agree on how to fulfill President Donald Trump’s agenda.

Pager argues that while there is obviously much intrigue surrounding the final months of the election, with Biden’s decision to drop out of the race, “in order to really understand how we got to that moment, you need to understand the two years preceding that.” He adds that the book’s “context and that comprehensiveness is really crucial to understanding this election.”\nThe trio, who conducted 350 interviews, were uniquely positioned to collaborate on such an expansive project, with Dawsey and Arnsdorf covering Donald Trump for the Post and Pager covering Biden. “The scope is really key,” Arnsdorf tells me of the book, which provides dueling portraits of both campaigns. “I think you can tell that we had wide and deep cooperation on both sides,” Dawsey adds. “It’s not a book that has an opinion, or really encourages you to take a side. I think it’s just reporting. And I hope that’s what stands out.”\nThe authors are trying to break through with new revelations following a string of dishy election postmortems from journalists Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson, Jon Allen and Amie Parnes, and Chris Whipple. They had some success already, with Politico reporting Monday on one of the book’s scoops, a fateful, six-page campaign memo urging Biden to debate Trump early.\nWhen Dawsey, Pager, and Arnsdorf started this project in 2022, they were all reporting for the Post, where a hallmark of the newsroom is “collaboration,” Pager tells me. “With an election this sprawling and with the amount of reporting that we felt we needed to do, under a very tight timeline, we were able to divide and conquer,” he adds. Soon after the election, however, Pager took a White House reporting job at The New York Times, while Dawsey joined The Wall Street Journal as a political investigations reporter, leaving Arnsdorf as the trio’s last standing Post reporter. “Luckily, almost all of the reporting and most of the writing was done before those of us who started new jobs started them,” Arnsdorf says, adding that they’re “working through” the challenges of being at different outlets during publication.\nDawsey and Pager aren’t the only ones to have left the Post in the last year, as the newspaper has experienced a significant restructuring under the leadership of publisher and CEO Will Lewis and owner Jeff Bezos, who caused shockwaves just ahead of the 2024 election for thwarting the Opinion board’s endorsement of Kamala Harris. The book’s acknowledgement section is filled with names of recently departed Post staffers, including Matea Gold, Ashley Parker, and Michael Scherer. When Dawsey and Pager were asked to reflect on their time at the newspaper and how it has changed recently, they remained diplomatic, expressing appreciation. “The newsroom of The Washington Post is a wonderful place, and I hope that it gets to stay,” Dawsey says.\nRegardless, their experience at the Post, past or present, placed no limits on sneaking a detail into the epilogue regarding Bezos and Trump’s blossoming relationship. According to the book, the pair started to speak regularly after the election, “commiserating over critical stories” published by Bezos’s newspaper. When asked how that revelation went over internally, Arnsdorf replied, “No one said anything to me about it.”\nThis interview has been edited for clarity.\nVanity Fair: This book enters a landscape that’s already flooded with reporting and analysis on this election. I’m curious what was the gap you felt this book needed to fill?\nTyler Pager: Just to put our book in context, we started working on this book long before the monumental presidential debate between Trump and Biden. We set out long before that, when we thought it was going to be a historic rematch between Biden and Trump. Josh and Isaac covered Trump for the Post, and I covered Biden, and we felt uniquely positioned to write the definitive story of the 2024 election. We knew it would be unpredictable and monumental and dramatically shape the future of our country, and we wanted to give readers the behind-the-scenes story of how we got to whatever result we did. I think that context is important because there’s obviously a lot of interest in the debate, Biden’s decision to drop out, and that sort of last few months of the election. But I think in order to really understand how we got to that moment, you need to understand the two years preceding that. So our book starts before the midterm elections. The sort of dueling scenes are Trump and the search at Mar-a-Lago for the classified documents, and Democrats thinking about launching presidential campaigns under the assumption that Joe Biden would not run for reelection. And so the book takes you from that through the end, and I think that context and that comprehensiveness is really crucial to understanding this election.\nIsaac Arnsdorf: The scope is really key. You can only understand what one candidate is doing when you understand what they’re reacting to on the other side. Some of the most interesting and ironic things happen in those misunderstandings between what one side thinks the other is doing and what’s really happening on the other side. Then also the depth of the reporting in this book, the 350 interviews that we did just for this book, on top of our reporting in real time at the Post, and then also the exhaustive, independent fact-checking, giving everyone the opportunity to respond to what was written about them. You’re getting a comprehensive, definitive, reliable account.\nJosh Dawsey: I think you can tell that we had wide and deep cooperation on both sides. One of the things I’m proud of in our book is that we have a lot of scenes and a lot of things where we just let the reader see exactly what we believe happened. It’s not a book that has an opinion, or really encourages you to take a side. I think it’s just reporting. And I hope that’s what stands out from this book.\nTo get into the nuts and bolts of that reporting, something I found particularly interesting was the behind-the-scenes during the Harris-Trump debate with ABC [in September]. You report that the Trump campaign is furious with ABC and David Muir for fact-checking him about the Springfield claims. Within the context of what we’ve seen with ABC News settling a lawsuit with Trump, was tension building up between the Trump camp and the network far longer than people realized?\nArnsdorf: The context for that is that the Trump campaign was going out of its way to avoid live fact-checking. There’s also this revealing scene at the National Association of Black Journalists convention where he almost won’t go on stage, and they keep everybody waiting because [Trump’s camp] refuse to have any live fact-checking. I sort of see it in terms of how the Trump campaign was managing its relationship with the traditional media throughout the campaign.\nPager: What you saw that night in that backstage scene, Trump’s top adviser is screaming at John Santucci, who’s an ABC producer who’s kind of close to Trump, has been one of the main bookers for them for a long time. Santucci has a deep relationship with Trump’s orbit. And what you see that night is [the adviser] pulling him out of another room, hauling him into the spin room where they are, and just screaming at him in profanities about the live fact-checking, which was a pretty remarkable scene. They did that with other debate moderators too, tried to work the refs during the debate, but there was no explosion quite like this.\nThere was a fascinating side-by-side of the independent media strategies of the Harris camp and the Trump camp, and it was pretty stark. Can you talk about how they approached that differently? I know Trump’s team consulted even Barron Trump and Alex Bruesewitz to connect with that voting bloc.\nPager: I think one of the really interesting things that we found in the book is clearly Trump had a very male-focused influencer digital media strategy. They had success in getting Trump outside the political bubble and political media space, and joined podcasts like Theo Von and Joe Rogan, and reached nontraditional voters. One of the things that the Harris campaign was really frustrated by was that this same equivalent podcast that maybe reached softer Democratic voters, like Hot Ones or the Kelce Brothers, they wouldn’t have her on. They were like, We don’t do politics. So there was this real dichotomy between Trump’s availability in some of these podcasts, media spaces, and the equivalent on the Democratic side just wasn’t really available for Harris. And so there’s been a big conversation within Democratic Party of, How do we create these spaces where our voters are, or our potential voters, that will take us as that, will bring us in and expose us to their voters?\nAs I read it, I was very interested in Trump’s deeply rooted concern about Iran’s desire to retaliate against him and his administration. How does that factor into recent decisions the administration is making?\nDawsey: I think there was a pervasive and real threat to Trump from Iran on the campaign. I mean, Trump’s team got repeated briefings from the FBI, from the intelligence community, about Iran potentially having kill teams on the ground. They were flying in a decoy plane for part of the campaign. They were using his friend Steve Witkoff’s plane because they were afraid about missiles potentially coming at the plane. Obviously, they had the two assassination attempts, neither one of them was directly linked to Iran, and we have no evidence that they were. But the FBI at the time could not rule out to Trump that it wasn’t. Trump kept asking them to rule out Iran. They couldn’t do it. And they made it pretty clear that they wanted him bad. It was a real paranoia from Trump at the end towards the Iranians.\nThere was a real sense that he was sort of under siege. Tony Fabrizio, his pollster, told folks that more than 50% of the time they spent on the campaign was planning, logistics, and security. Several other of his advisers told me that was true. If not, they thought it was more. Everywhere he went, they had to go in advance and do bulletproof glass. I think the threats really were maybe not that serious. But when you’ve been shot in the ear and you have all these things happening, everything feels serious at the time. His team went to some pretty extraordinary methods. One of them, at least, had a gun in the office. They had military equipment, they were trying to keep the blinds closed. They were walking to Air Force One, and the Secret Service told them, Put your head down and rush to the plane. There was a sense of real fear there.\nA big part of this book is obviously the partnership between Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita. I just saw that Lindsey Graham’s reelection campaign is adding LaCivita as a senior adviser. Just given he’s such a big character in this book, what are your reactions to that?\nArnsdorf: [Chuckles] Good for Chris.\nDawsey: Chris is a great character in the book. It’s hard to really put Chris on page because he’s such a larger-than-life, dynamic character—incredibly profane, mercurial, loves a nice glass of wine. I’m not saying that with any judgment in my voice here. He just loves a nice glass of wine. He is very type A to every degree. There was a time we have in the book where American Bridge put together this oppo book on Chris LaCivita, all these crazy things he had said and done over the years, trying to get a reporter to write about it. We sent it to him and he wrote back, “Lol, all true.” He sort of wears that bravado as a badge of honor, so to speak.\nI think he was a tip of the spear in this campaign. We put in the book that Trump told Susie, you’re too nice, we need an asshole. And she found that asshole in Chris. Someone who would be aggressive, who would be out there posting the kinds of things Susie’s never going to post on Twitter, screaming at people, doing the public-facing part of it. Susie took a more managerial behind-the-scenes role. I don’t think Susie has ever used some of the language that Chris LaCivita uses. And I think Chris would laugh and say, That’s true. I’m not just trying to say that he’s a bombastic, wild guy. He’s a shrewd guy. I think there’s a lot of things about him that are quite smart, but he played a particular role, and Susie played a different role.\nAll three of you started writing this book while at The Washington Post, and a lot has changed since then, with two of you now reporting elsewhere. How did that work logistically in the writing and reporting process, and did it get more complicated?\nArnsdorf: Luckily, almost all of the reporting and most of the writing was done before those of us who started new jobs started them. So that definitely helped. We’re working through it, the three of us all being at different places when the book comes out. But in some ways, that’s helpful.\nPager: I would also say, in terms of writing a book with three people, one of the hallmarks of The Washington Post is collaboration. So we developed this sort of relationship where we work well together, and I think with an election this sprawling and with the amount of reporting that we felt we needed to do, under a very tight timeline, we were able to divide and conquer and tell the most comprehensive story of this election. I mean, there were three campaigns that we covered from start to end, and there were three of us, and we didn’t directly divide it up that way, but we were able to cast a wide reporting net, and each of us, I think, brought different and complementary skills to the project. I think we were able to really bring all of the reporting and writing together to tell this story in the most definitive way we could.\nDawsey: I don’t think you could do a book that required this much reporting, this many fact-checks, this many interviews, on a compressed timetable, by yourself. I don’t know how you would do it.\nIn the epilogue, you write about Trump’s relationship with Jeff Bezos, reporting that they started to speak regularly, commiserating over critical stories in the Post, according to Trump. How is that detail going over at the Post, given that one of you is still there promoting this book?\nArnsdorf: No one said anything to me about it.\nPager: I don’t work there anymore, but The Washington Post has long done critical coverage of Jeff Bezos and continues to cover Amazon. There’s been no evidence or knowledge of interference.\nDawsey: Whatever you think about Bezos, whether you hate him or love him, he never messed with any of my stories, and we did some pretty critical stories of him last fall after the endorsement. I don’t think there’s any evidence he’s really messed with the newsroom. I mean, he certainly made his improvements to everything on the editorial board, but he’s the owner. Owners get to have an impact on the editorial board.\nAs I was flipping through the acknowledgements, I was just struck by how many people are mentioned who have left the Post over the last year. I’m curious if either Tyler or Josh want to reflect on your time there?\nPager: I have nothing but positive things to say about my experience at The Washington Post. Josh was there for longer, so I don’t want to speak for him, but I got a great opportunity to cover the White House at The New York Times and was very excited to do that. I have nothing but positive things to say about my four years at the Washington Post.\nDawsey: I have nothing but positive things to say about the newsroom and the folks that I worked with closely in the newsroom, and the journalism that we were able to do in the newsroom. That’s what I would say. I really want to put a pin on that. I think the newsroom of The Washington Post is a wonderful place, and I hope that it gets to stay. That’s what I’ll say.\nI wanted to end on the subtitle of the book, not simply how Trump returned to the White House, but also “how Democrats lost America.” Do you feel that there’s a particular decisive error that they made during this election, or just a lot of dominoes fell in the wrong places?\nPager: One of the biggest things the Democrats did wrong was they ignored what their voters were telling them for months. For years, Democratic voters made clear, the majority of them, that they did not want Joe Biden to run for a second term. We saw that in poll after poll after poll, and it didn’t seem to matter. The Biden view was, They’re wrong. The numbers will improve as Trump becomes the clear opponent, as we make the case. There’s a really good scene in the book where Biden, just before Thanksgiving, is sort of yelling at his aides, Why are my poll numbers not higher? And his aides are like, They’ll get better, just stay the course. And they didn’t, and voters kept saying, We don’t want this choice. We want something else. And they ignored them.\nArnsdorf: They recognized that they needed to have a winning message on the economy, and once Harris took over, they recognized they had the problem with Biden’s shadow. And in both cases, they just never came up with an answer. They agonized over it, they had meetings, they spun their wheels, and they wrung their hands, and they just did nothing.","summary":"A trio of top political reporters is out with a new election postmortem, 2024, which promises the most comprehensive picture of a consequential race. “We had wide and deep cooperation on both sides,” coauthor Josh Dawsey tells VF.","url":"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/democrats-ignored-voters-it-cost-them-2024-election-book","image":"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/686c1aebe90022d7712a8fbc/16:9/w_2000,h_1125,c_limit/Donald-Trump-Kamala-Harris-Joe-Biden.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-08 10:00:00","author":"Natalie Korach","authors":["Natalie Korach"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.091},{"id":339521008,"title":"Kroft Claims '60 Minutes' Staff Fear 'Losing The First Amendment'","text":"Comedy Central’s The Daily Show returned from two weeks of vacation on Monday with Jon Stewart welcoming former 60 Minutes correspondent Steve Kroft to the program to claim that his former colleagues fear “losing the First Amendment” after mutual parent company Paramount settled with President Trump in a lawsuit over their 2024 campaign interview with Kamala Harris. Elsewhere, Stewart ranted and raved against the Big Beautiful Bill, claiming that supporters better get used to people like Zohran Mamdani, because he is “the best case scenario.”\n\nStewart declared, “Paramount, which is the parent company for CBS and 60 Minutes, and also for Comedy Central, recently made the unusual arrangement of settling a lawsuit that President Trump brought for—and I don't even really know what it was for. And they paid him—”\n\nKroft interrupted to add, “It was making one edit.”\n\nStewart then continued, “They made an edit. You bastards. They paid him $16 million. What is—I would assume internally, that is devastating, to the people who work in a place that pride themselves on contextual, good journalism.”\n\nIt is statements like that that make the late night comedy shows unintentionally funny. 60 Minutes has constantly performed hit pieces against Republicans and was spreading fake news before that became a popular term.\n\nNaturally, however, Kroft agreed with Stewart, “No, devastating’s a good word. I think there's a lot of fear over there.”\n\nAfter Stewart asked him to elaborate, Kroft proceeded, “Fear of losing their job. Fear of what's happening to the country. Fear of losing the First Amendment.”\n\nStewart then asked why Paramount agreed, and Kroft responded by doing the “some say” form of answering, “Well, you know, a couple of congressmen think it was bribery.”\n\nEarlier in the show, Stewart played a clip of GOP Rep. Troy Nehls discounting the Congressional Budget Office’s estimations of how many people will lose their health insurance due to the BBB because they are “wrong half the damn time.”\n\nWork requirements omitted from his rant, Stewart declared that Nehls gets sexually aroused at the idea of kicking people off Medicaid and food stamps, “A congressman who just voted to force people off of Medicaid and food assistance, just smoking a fatty, with both hands bandaged from what I can only assume was a friction burn from too much celebratory masturbation. There is no other way around it. ‘Ugh, Medicaid and food stamps! I've got blisters on me fingers!’”\n\nHe then claimed, “The problem in our country isn't the sliver of able-bodied people that are somehow coasting on the unearned medical coverage they may or may not use, but the millions and millions of people in this country who work [bleep] full-time jobs and still need food and medical assistance. That's the system that's broken. Fix that system! What are we talking about? And yet, oh, we're gaslit into this framework of \"The deserving poor.\"\n\nConcluding his monologue, Stewart did his parody impression of a Republican, “Excuse me? Who ate the porridge that was here? Who ate the porridge? You boy! What day is it, boy? Christmas Day? Take this dubloon, buy the biggest Christmas goose you can find, and take it to the heliport. I have a pilot—\"\n\nReverting to his normal Angry Man persona, Stewart warned, “Look, blaming migrants and the able-bodied poor is why Trump won this election, but a system where working people struggle so much is why Mamdani won his election. And for all the people who are worried about Mamdani's socialist tendencies. Guess what? He's the best case scenario, because this system is not sustainable.

While unemployment is falling, inflation is down, illegal border crossings are plummeting under Trump, and the president dealing successfully with Iran’s nuclear threat, little of that positive news penetrated the tax-funded liberal bubble.\n\nKey Findings:\n\n■ The panelists spent 83 minutes opining on Republicans, focusing on Trump and his administration, in 93% negative fashion (77 minutes negative, six minutes positive).\n\n■ Show “intros” by moderator Jeffrey Goldberg often set a mocking anti-Trump tone, not the “civil discourse” promised.\n\n■ Of the 14 different media outlets that were represented on Washington Week during the study period, all but one hailed from the left end of the political spectrum – and that single one (The Dispatch) sounded as liberal as the rest.\n\nOur previous Washington Week study from March 2024 found coverage fixated on the upcoming elections, and also included Trump’s courtroom controversies and leadership strife in the Republican-controlled Congress. Back then, coverage ran 90% negative against the Republican Party and Trump.\n\nThis time around, even with supposedly bipartisan foreign policy issues on the table like Iran, the coverage only became more slanted, at 93% negative.\n\nTop Five Most-Discussed Republican Issues\n\nTrump’s Tariffs: 730 total seconds, 664 seconds negative, 66 seconds positive, 91% negative coverage\n\nDonald Trump in General*: 659 total seconds, 587 seconds negative, 72 seconds positive: 89% negative coverage\n\nTrump’s Immigration Policy (including judiciary conflict): 468 total seconds, 468 seconds negative, 0 seconds positive: 100% negative coverage\n\nTrump’s Foreign Policy in General (excluding Israel/Iran and Russia/Ukraine): 463 total seconds, 428 seconds negative, 35 seconds positive: 92.4% negative coverage\n\nRepublicans in Congress: 297 total seconds, 297 seconds negative, 0 seconds positive: 100% negative coverage\n\n* Coverage of Trump without ties to a specific, current political issue; for example, Trump reacting to the new pope, his social media postings about journalists, or a look back at his first 100 days in office\n\nWorth a mention is the #6 item on the list, Trump and Iran. Despite Trump’s success in ordering a successful strike on Iran’s dangerous bomb program after weeks of diplomacy, Washington Week coverage was resoundingly negative, both before and after the successful strike on the Fordow nuclear site: 292 total seconds, 239 seconds negative, 53 seconds positive: 82% negative coverage\n\nTop Five Most-Discussed Democratic Issues\n\nIn contrast, there were only trace mentions of the Democratic Party over the study period, always within broader Trump-related discussions -- outside the special episode devoted wholly to the Biden campaign expose book Original Sin on the coverup of President Joe Biden’s decline into decrepitude.\n\nHere’s how Washington Week panelists treated the top five most-discussed Democratic political personalities/groups over the three-month study period:\n\nThe Biden White House: 565 total seconds, 0 seconds positive, 565 seconds negative, 100% negative\n\nThe Biden Debate Fiasco: 174 total seconds, 0 seconds positive, 174 seconds negative, 100% negative\n\nPresident Biden himself: 118 total seconds, 7 seconds positive, 111 seconds negative, 94% negative\n\nKamala Harris: 46 total seconds, 0 seconds positive, 46 seconds negative, 100% negative\n\nDemocrats in Congress: 42 total seconds, 0 seconds positive, 42 seconds negative, 100% negative\n\nVirtually all Democratic coverage came from the May 23 special episode on the Biden campaign expose Original Sin. Remove that episode, and the Democrats received a piddling 61 seconds of “coverage” (18 seconds negative, 43 seconds positive), which consisted of fleeting mentions within Trump-related stories.\n\nGOLDBERG’S SPICY SET-UPS\n\n Upon taking up the show’s moderator reins in August 2023, Jeffrey Goldberg, editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, bragged that the renamed Washington Week with The Atlantic was “a space for civil and extended conversation about the issues affecting the news and our world.” But that promised civility has yet to transpire under his supervision as host.\n\nGoldberg raised his own profile across PBS on the March 28, 2025 Washington Week episode (outside this study’s parameter) mocking the administration while talking about how he had been accidentally added to a White House encrypted group chat on the Signal phone app where administration officials discussed bombing the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen.\n\nGoldberg also made himself the center of attention with his loaded introductions to the weekly panels, setting anti-Trump tones from the start. Here’s a sampling of his conversation starters:\n\nApril 4: “Financial markets have tanked as angry allies and adversaries alike retaliate against America after President Trump announces drastic new tariffs.”\n\nApril 11: “Like all of you, I'm trying to figure out if there's a method to the seeming [tariff] madness we've all experienced this past week. This is the kind of week in which you shouldn't, among other things, look at your 401(k) too closely. I did, mistake.”\n\nMay 30: “Most presidents wait until they leave the White House to cash in. President Trump takes a different approach. Crypto deals, hotels, golf courses, 747s, everything is on the table. If there's a way to make money off the presidency, he's on it. Tonight, we'll talk about all the ways Trump is treating the White House and Mar-a-Lago as places to help make him richer than he already is, next.”\n\nJune 6: “….at home, the rule of law is in real danger, next.”\n\n“Civil” conversation?\n\nWho’s Talking?\n\nGoldberg moderated 11 of the 13 weekly episodes included in the study, with reporters Laura Barron-Lopez of PBS News Hour and Ashley Parker of The Atlantic guest moderating one episode each.\n\nIn all, 29 individual panelists (including moderator Goldberg) landed on Washington Week during the study period, some making multiple appearances. They represented 14 different media outlets, mostly legacy media, all but one (The Dispatch) reliably parked on the left end of the spectrum.\n\nThe New York Times led the pack with appearances by six different reporters, and staff from Goldberg’s Atlantic had five different appearances (Goldberg himself counting as a single appearance).\n\n In the abstract, the increased presence on the roundtable of journalist Stephen Hayes of the center-right anti-Trump outlet The Dispatch was a small step toward balance. Hayes made four appearances over the 13 episodes; however, Hayes’s contributions were in line with those from the legacy media outlets, matching their harsh anti-Trump tone. On April 25 he lamented of Trump’s foreign policy, “the ethos is, sadly, we are the bully and we're unapologetic about it.”\n\nTied with Hayes at four appearances was Nancy Youssef, representing the Wall Street Journal (but recently poached by Goldberg to write for The Atlantic). White House reporter Peter Baker of the New York Times, Ashley Parker of The Atlantic, and David Ignatius, foreign policy columnist of the Washington Post, made three appearances each.\n\nOn an ironic note, Eugene Daniels, MSNBC reporter and head of the White House Correspondents’ Association, accused the White House on April 18 of “frankly, lying” that the WHCA had not brought in new organizations to cover the White House, bragging the WHCA had brought in, among others “The Daily Caller, right, Christian Broadcast News, all these different types of organizations….”\n\nYet unlike Daniels’ employer MSNBC, The Daily Caller never appears on the Washington Week panel. Neither do staffers from Fox News, The Washington Times, Washington Examiner, or Washington Free Beacon.\n\nWhat they Said: Trump Administration Has \"Repeatedly Emboldened Extremists\"\n\nModerator Goldberg was far from the only harsh critic of Trump and his administration on Washington Week. ABC News’ Jonathan Karl made an over-the-top prediction in an April11 discussion of Trump’s back and forth on tariff threats as “actually threatening us with not just a bad stock market but with a potential economic meltdown.”\n\nReacting to liberal Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska expressing fear of Trumpian attacks, PBS News Hour White House correspondent Laura Barron-Lopez ranted on April 18: “….this shouldn't really be a surprise to her or to others that Republicans are in this situation because the administration, even before Trump took office, have repeatedly emboldened extremists and used hate speech to talk about their political enemies.” Later she said: “And normalizing the populace to political violence is a trait of authoritarianism.”\n\nFollowing some vague hints of trouble at The Pentagon from NPR’s Asma Khalid, Goldberg gave some unsolicited advice to Trump on the April 25 show: “Why doesn’t he fire [Secretary of Defense] Pete Hegseth?”\n\nOn May 9, Susan Glasser of The New Yorker magazine complained of backlash about the new American pope from “very conservative, very right-wing Catholics in the United States.”\n\nVeteran NBC News reporter Andrea Mitchell said on May 16 that in Trump’s Washington, “The real game-changer is the level of open corruption.”\n\nEven in the otherwise laudable May 23 episode wholly devoted to talking to the authors of Original Sin, Jake Tapper of CNN and Alex Thompson of Axios, Goldberg and Tapper made unwarranted excuses for the media’s passive coverage. Not mentioned: Goldberg himself in a 2023 Washington Week episode insisted of the obviously declining Biden, “Mentally, he’s quite acute.”\n\nOn May 30, Leigh Ann Caldwell of Puck faulted Trump’s popular move against Harvard University, saying, “this just seems pretty extreme for people who want immigration crackdown and want lower costs.”\n\nDuring another special episode on June 6 featuring a single panelist, veteran New York Times foreign affairs correspondent Thomas Friedman, after Friedman pondered what would happen if Democrats took power and started acting like Trump, Goldberg set him up.\n\nThomas Friedman: And if that happens, we're really off to the races, then the whole thing just starts to disappear.\n\nGoldberg: What country does that remind you of, that condition?\n\nFriedman: You know, I mean so many dictatorships just in general that I've covered over the years….”\n\nPraise for Trump on Washington Week came in fleeting spurts. Goldberg gave the president credit on May 9 for praising the new American-born pope on social media (“the president was very kind about the new pope”) while Friedman on June 6 ironically admitted Trump’s transactional approach to foreign policy in the Middle East might not be all bad (\"Some things are also true even if Donald Trump believes them….his transactionalism sometimes can also be an advantage. For instance, I'm glad he's sitting down with the Iranians”).\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nThe publicly funded Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) that airs Washington Week with The Atlantic was launched in 1969 by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which was born with a congressional mandate to maintain \"strict adherence to objectivity and balance in all programs or series of programs of a controversial nature.” Yet judging by our findings from the early days of the second Trump Administration, the tax-funded Washington Week with the Atlantic continues to grossly betray its mandate to the American taxpayer to provide ideological balance.\n\nMETHODOLOGY:\n\nWe tallied all explicitly evaluative comments from Washington Week with The Atlantic panelists (e.g., colorful, mocking, flattering, and ideologically loaded descriptions) regarding Democrats or Republicans. Straightforward descriptions, explanations, and analysis were not included.\n\nThe top five areas of discussion involving each party were then ranked based on the total amount of time in which they were positively or negatively evaluated, along with a percentage figure documenting the resulting spin, whether positive or negative.\n\nWe also counted and sorted the media affiliation of the panelists.","summary":"Washington Week with The Atlantic, public television’s taxpayer-funded weekly political roundtable featuring a rotating stable of journalists, touts itself as \"objective.”\n\nBut a review of the last three months of Washington Week (April 4, 2025 – June 27, 2025) proved Trump-phobic liberalism still reigns over the public airwaves.

And when asked to choose between Harris and an unnamed Republican candidate, just 41 percent chose Harris, while 29 percent chose the unnamed Republican. Sixteen percent said they were undecided and 14 percent said they would not vote.Jon Gould, dean of UC Irvine's School of Social Ecology and director of the UCI-OC Poll, told Newsweek that if Harris were to jump into the race to replace California Governor Gavin Newsom, she \"would start as the prohibitive favorite, but there is plenty of room for others to successfully compete with her.\"It would provide \"a perfectly timed opportunity to revitalize her career,\" Kousser said. \"Many of her political stances and policy positions that proved a liability in the national contest could be strengths in this solidly blue state.\"But Costas Panagopoulos, a professor of political science at Northeastern University, believes Harris could still face a challenge in the governor's race.\"The stain of a national presidential loss can be difficult to overcome,\" he told Newsweek. \"Failed bids for the presidency can suppress support for these contenders if they subsequently seek other offices.\"Harris could face a tougher battle if she chooses to run for president again in 2028. The contest is expected to attract a large field of candidates, and a recent poll found that former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg is currently more favored than Harris.However, a Morning Consult poll released in June showed Harris with a stronger lead, with 34 percent saying they planned to support her. Seven percent said they would vote for Buttigieg in that poll, while 11 percent said they leaned toward Newsom.\"I do not see much of a political future at the national level for Harris, due to a variety of factors,\" Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University, told Newsweek.\"Even though she was dealt a tough hand in the presidential race, she struggled as a candidate, particularly when asked specific questions about her policy positions and about Biden administration policies, which presumably she was partly responsible for.\"She is also tied to former President Joe Biden, who has faced increasing scrutiny about his mental acuity since leaving office with new books alleging White House aides had covered up his physical and mental decline.Harris \"either had to know and was part of the cover-up, or she was so out of the loop at the White House that she was unaware—either of those does not reflect well on her,\" Reeher said.Those issues could also hurt her in a statewide race, he said.\"She has 100 percent name recognition out of the gate, but the questions about her role in the Biden administration and her stumbling as a candidate could knock her back, along with the general 'hangover' effect of the 2024 loss to Trump that some donors have articulated,\" he said.Reeher said a better path for Harris may be if she \"stays around and participates in national conversations, helps the Democratic nominee in 2028, and if the Democrat wins, is rewarded with a Cabinet position.\"The fact that Harris \"failed to come as close as many expected, bested by Trump in all battleground states, will make it even harder for her\" to mount a successful bid for the White House in 2028, Panagopoulos said.Voters in her home state of California \"can be more forgiving and receptive, but nationally, voters may feel Harris has already had her shot,\" he said. \"They may be more apt to be looking for fresh faces.\"","summary":"The former vice president is expected to announce whether she is entering the race for California governor by the end of the summer.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/kamala-harris-comeback-hopes-blow-2094786","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2676601/kamala-harris-comeback-hopes-take-blow.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-08 09:00:01","author":"Khaleda Rahman","authors":["Khaleda Rahman"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.177},{"id":339388416,"title":"Stevie Wonder sends blunt message to world leaders","text":"Stevie Wonder has urged the world's leaders to \"get their s*** together\".\n\nThe iconic musician insisted anyone in a position of power should be using their platform to \"bring peace to all the world\".\n\nSpeaking to the crowd during a concert in Birmingham in the UK on Monday (07.07.25), he said: \"I believe we need the leaders of the world, to take advantage of what they've been given to do - to bring peace to all the world.\n\n\"I don't care who you are, you could be a president or a prime minister, it doesn't matter.

It’s smart staging. South Carolina has symbolic weight after its role in 2020, and rural outreach is a box any national contender has to check these days, especially if they want to contrast themselves with a more coastal, urban image.”\n\nSouth Carolina played a crucial role in 2020, resuscitating then-candidate Joe Biden’s lagging campaign after disappointing results in Iowa and New Hampshire. With the endorsement of Rep. James Clyburn (D-SC), Biden won the state, the first with a large black electorate, a crucial voting bloc for Democrats. In 2024, the state became the Democratic Party’s first binding Democratic primary of the cycle.\n\nWaite added that the trip is a good idea from a “purely strategic point.”\n\n“It costs him nothing in California, builds national headlines, and earns goodwill with the DNC and other state parties that value a 50-state approach,” he said. “Even if he doesn’t end up running, it continues to raise his profile as a top surrogate and party leader.”\n\nRural communities often feel neglected, especially by politicians who concentrate on urban areas. For Newsom, or any candidate, engaging with rural residents helps project an image of inclusivity and concern for all constituents.\n\nMatthew Klink, a partner at California Strategies, told the Washington Examiner it seemed a little hypocritical that Newsom was headed to the opposite coast to help out rural farmers at a time when he has been accused of ignoring them in his own state. \n\n“It’s interesting that Christale Spain, chair of the state Democrat Party, says that Gavin Newsom is going to focus on rural South Carolina voters,” Klink said. “It’s worth noting that he hasn’t focused on California’s rural voters during his tenure as governor, which is a notably red part of the state. These working-class voters have abandoned the Democratic Party in droves. So, if Governor Newsom is going to ‘sell’ South Carolina voters on the idea that he would do for them what he did for California rural voters, it’s an empty promise.”\n\nBrad Chase, founder of Chase Global, which specializes in crisis management and public affairs, warned that Newsom should be cognizant about how much time he spends in other states. \n\n“Newsom’s press shop is certain to say he’s focused solely on his current job, but it’s clear that his top priority is the 2028 presidential election,” Chase told the Washington Examiner. “Many Democrats surely will appreciate his recent success — at least relative to the failing Democratic national leadership — in the public fight against Trump. They’ll cheer him stepping into the leadership vacuum left by the Democratic gerontocracy.\n\n“L.A. Mayor Bass’s precipitous fall shows that taking your eye off the ball at home can create problems, but Newsom likely doesn’t care if his approval ratings drop since California is locked up on the electoral map. The bigger potential downside is that voters could tire of him by the time the presidential primaries roll around. Like [Florida Gov. Ron] DeSantis, his moment can come and go before it really counts.”\n\nNewsom is among the top Democratic Party candidates for president in 2028, according to a June Emerson College Polling survey, which asked more than 400 Democratic primary voters nationwide about their choice for a 2028 candidate. \n\nFormer Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg led with 16%, followed by former Vice President Kamala Harris at 13%. Newsom came in third at 12%, while Gov. Josh Shapiro (D-PA) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) tied for fourth with 7%.\n\nYOUNGKIN TO HEADLINE SWING STATE EVENTS WITH POST-GOVERNOR AMBITIONS UNKNOWN\n\nCalls to Newsom’s office for additional comment were not returned.\n\nNewsom isn’t the only California lawmaker heading to the Palmetto State. Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) is also scheduled to travel there July 19-20 with the advocacy organization Protect Our Care, which mobilizes voters in swing House districts against the Republican cuts to Medicaid in the recently passed budget bill.","summary":"Gov.

He’s advocated for rent freezes, increases in minimum wages and having the city open its own grocery stores to drive down food costs.\n\nMamdani’s emergence as a new party leader with a pronounced left-of-center campaign resonates a continent away in California, a one-party state whose dominant Democrats are often divided along ideological lines, pitting Mamdani-like progressives against business-oriented moderates.\n\nIn the main, progressives have been losing ground to the mods, even in the San Francisco Bay Area, the bluest region in a deep-blue state. Daniel Lurie’s recent election as mayor of San Francisco, on pledges to balance the city’s deficit-ridden budget and crack down on street crime, is one indication of that trend.

He’s advocated for rent freezes, increases in minimum wages and having the city open its own grocery stores to drive down food costs.\n\nMamdani’s emergence as a new party leader with a pronounced left-of-center campaign resonates a continent away in California, a one-party state whose dominant Democrats are often divided along ideological lines, pitting Mamdani-like progressives against business-oriented moderates.\n\nIn the main, progressives have been losing ground to the mods, even in the San Francisco Bay Area, the bluest region in a deep-blue state. Daniel Lurie’s recent election as mayor of San Francisco, on pledges to balance the city’s deficit-ridden budget and crack down on street crime, is one indication of that trend. The recall or rejection of other Bay Area progressive officeholders in recent elections is another.\n\nAs the political website Politico noted recently, “Zohran Mamdani’s rise in New York enraptured progressives across the country.

It feels like fealty, that they are being held to a standard that will never be satisfactory to Donald Trump. No one can ever kiss his ass enough.The $16 million was tribute. That’s how he looks at it.

Paramount also said that “in the future, 60 Minutes will release transcripts of interviews with eligible U.S. presidential candidates after such interviews have aired.”\n\n“This is all about ’60 Minutes,’” the former CBS employee and Fox News host said. “[They] wanted Kamala Harris to win the election. There’s no doubt about it. You just go back and look at the transcripts as I have, and it’s all about promoting Kamala and diminishing Trump.”\n\nTrump claimed CBS interfered with the election and damaged his own companies when it aired a promo that was different from an answer Harris gave to correspondent Bill Whitaker. While O’Reilly believes Trump had a point, he didn’t think the president would have won.\n\n“I don’t think that CBS would have lost that case in court,” O’Reilly said. “There is a difference, but is it egregious? So Trump sued them for billions of dollars.”\n\nO’Reilly said he knows the corporate media has gone far left – “I know … I don’t think that, it’s not an opinion” – and played a clip from the October 8, 2024 interview to prove his point.\n\n“Whitaker should have gone bang — ‘Give me one solution you’ve offered in the first year of the Biden administration.’ Give me one’ … Because she always falls back on, ‘Oh, Trump killed the immigration bill that Charles Schumer ginned up early this year.’ … [Whitaker] booted it because he didn’t anticipate the boldness of the lie — that what she just said, ‘From day one, literally, we have been offering solutions,’ is about the biggest falsehood I have heard from any politician in the last decade.”\n\nO’Reilly said Trump proved as much when he shut down the border and “stopped the illegal immigration asylum madness in two months.”\n\n“Whitaker was soft on her,” O’Reilly added. “This is not an interview. It’s not the way it’s done. You’ve been watching me for almost 30 years. You know how an interview on television should be done. This is gibberish.”\n\nParamount Global has agreed to merge with Skydance Media in a complex $8 billion deal.
