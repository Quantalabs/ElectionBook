{"offset":0,"number":50,"available":472,"news":[{"id":379142638,"title":"The Swamp Got Bigger, Better Paid & More Secretive Since 2020","text":"Via Open The Books,\n\nIf you were told a business increased their staff headcount by 5% over four years but its payroll rose 24% over that time, all the while withholding the names of 39% of their staff, would you invest in that company?\n\nUnlikely. But that’s just what the United State government does, funded by taxpayer dollars and operating as if accountable to no one.\n\nOpen the Books analyzed the FY 2024 payroll records of executive agencies and found that 2.9 million federal employees were paid $270 billion, compared to 2.8 million employees paid $217 billion in FY 2020. While the civilian employee ranks grew 5%, pay grew nearly 5 times as much, 24%.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management provided the pay for over 1.5 million executive agency bureaucrats; Department of Defense provided pay for its 761,624 civilian employees; and United States Postal Service gave its 638,007 employees’ payroll, via Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests.\n\nNot included are pay for judicial branch employees; the 535 members of Congress and their staff; the 1.3 million active-duty military members; the Office of the Vice President (which claims itself entirely exempt from FOIA); nor the staff of several intelligence agencies.\n\nWhile payroll records don’t include benefits, adding an estimated 30% to the $270 billion payroll brings total costs to $351 billion.\n\nThat means the disclosed federal workforce costs the American taxpayer $673,000 per minute, $40.4 million per hour, and just under $1 billion per day.\n\nMeanwhile, more than a million civilian names were redacted from payroll productions produced by Office of Personnel Management and Department of Defense.\n\nThe Trump administration has a historic opportunity to bring much-needed transparency to the administrative state. While federal employees don’t add as much to the debt as safety net programs, defense, and overall agency spending, they are an indicator of government growth.\n\nA New Minimum Wage? $100,000 Earners\n\nThese employees are now being paid more than ever before.\n\nThe average pay exceeded $100,000 in 117 of 127 executive agencies and the White House.\n\nIn FY 2024, there were 31,452 federal employees who out-earned every governor of the 50 states. That includes the highest paid, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, who collects a $250,000 salary.\n\nEven worse, there were 956 federal employees who outearned the president himself.\n\nThe vast majority — 939 people — are medical officers at the Veterans Health Administration, while another 15 doctors at the National Institutes of Health earning more than $400,000.\n\nTwo more people outearned the president: Micah Nix, an emergency room doctor with the Indian Health Service, part of Department of Health and Human Services and one other redacted employee working at Bureau of Prisons, part of Department of Justice.\n\nThe highest paid federal employee is cardiologist Gary H. Gibbons, Director of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute at the National Institutes of Health. He earned $519,246 last year.\n\nLest one think these highly paid doctors are the only ones raking in big checks, the payroll is top-heavy across the board.\n\nOf the 2.1 million non-DOD employees in FY 2024, 793,537 people made $100,000 or more, a 49% increase from 532,784 people in FY 2020.\n\nThere were 68,445 employees who earned $200,000 or more – an 82% increase from 37,631 in FY 2020.\n\nThose making $300,000 or more numbered at 14,144 – an 84% increase from 7,692 in FY 2020.\n\nAt least 20 federal agencies have an average pay above $150,000. Topping the list is Commodity Futures Trading Commission, where the 721 staffers make an average of $236,006.\n\nThe obscure Public Buildings Reform Board and Arctic Research Commission each pay their staff an average of $192,000, while the 1,851 employees of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau earn an average pay of $187,120.\n\nBoards for Civil Rights Cold Case Review, Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight, and Surface Transportation have average pay between $166,091 and $181,903.\n\nThe Swamp Gets Larger\n\nIn the largest federal agencies, there’s little correlation between employee headcounts and increased pay.\n\nIn most cases, even a decrease in headcount still led to an increase in total pay for that agency.\n\nFor instance, the Post Office lost 6% of its staff between FY 2020 and FY 2024, yet payroll increased 11% during that time.\n\nAt Department of Justice, headcount decreased less than 1% but its payroll nonetheless increased 16%.\n\nSocial Security Administration and Department of Commerce both lost staff in those years, 4% and 8%, respectively, but their payrolls still increased 11% and 13%.\n\nAt the agencies where headcount increased, payroll soared past them. Department of Homeland Security increased its staff by 6% but its payroll went up 26%. Department of Transportation saw its staff grow by 3% but its payroll by 19%.\n\nThose that grew headcount significantly saw their payroll skyrocket, including a 19% staff increase at both Department of Health and Human Services and Department of State, with 39% and 35% increased payrolls, respectively.\n\nA 20% increase in Department of Energy headcount led to a 37% increase in paychecks.\n\nTop 20 Departments and Agencies by Employee Count\n\n“Name Withheld” for 39% of Staff\n\nThe secrecy of the federal bureaucracy has worsened.\n\nIt’s bad enough that Department of Defense redacted all 761,624 civilian employee names from their payroll, and that records production excludes pay for 1.3 million active-duty military members.\n\nWhen Open the Books requested the FY 2022 federal payroll, the Biden administration had redacted the names of 350,860 rank-and-file employees.\n\nIn the most recent FY 2024 production a record-breaking 383,000 names were redacted in 58 federal agencies. Back in FY 2016, a mere 2,300 names were redacted. \n\nMany of those include investigative and law enforcement roles in agencies including Departments of Homeland Security, Justice, Treasury and Veterans’ Affairs — which account for 97% of the redactions.\n\nBut still, dozens of additional agencies redacted names, from two each at U.S. Agency for Global Media, Office of National Drug Control Policy and Armed Forces Retirement Home, to over 1,000 each in Departments of Labor, Agriculture, Transportation and Health and Human Services. At Department of Interior, 2,331 identities were redacted.\n\nThe payroll report also contains no information about staff in the Office of the Vice President.\n\nThat’s because the Office of the Vice President claims not to be subject to FOIA and is not listed on the FOIA website.\n\nOpen the Books has tried unsuccessfully in the past to obtain the salaries through open records requests, and has accessed limited payroll information in the semi-annual Report of the Secretary of the Senate.\n\nIn the most recent report covering Oct. 1, 2024, through March 31, 2025, we can see that Kamala Harris ended her stay in the office with 43 staffers, while J.D. Vance began his vice presidential term with 23 staffers.\n\nAs the federal headcount and payroll grow, there are far too many redactions and blind spots that DOGE should have identified and fixed. We can’t have accountability for the federal workforce without better transparency.","url":"https://www.zerohedge.com/political/swamp-got-bigger-better-paid-more-secretive-2020","image":"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/16_9_max_700/public/2025-11/https-3A-2F-2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com-2Fpublic-2Fimages-2F9242e476-0df7-4189-a9f1-518188efb9d0_1456x1048.jpeg_80.jpg?h=08d38f82&amp;itok=cP0Sxvt6","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-15 00:15:00","author":"Tyler Durden","authors":["Tyler Durden"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.147},{"id":379137990,"title":"Democrats mocked for ‘out of touch’ comments dismissing no tax on tips: ‘Peak elitism’","text":"Nevada Democratic representatives Dina Titus, Susie Lee and Steven Horsford are being mocked as \"out of touch\" for keeping silent after a national Democratic Party spokesperson dismissed no tax on tips as mere \"crumbs.\" In a Politico article about the importance of the no tax on tips policy in congressional races in Nevada, Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spokesperson Lindsay Reilly appeared to dismiss the policy, saying, \"D.C. Republicans are giving temporary crumbs to working families.\" Reilly added, \"Meanwhile, millions of families are at risk of losing their health care, hundreds of hospitals could close, and countless Americans could lose their jobs — all to pay for permanent tax cuts for billionaires.\" The no-tax-on-tips provision in the big, beautiful bill establishes an income tax deduction of up to $25,000 on qualified tipped income through 2028. WATCH: DEM LAWMAKERS ATTEMPT TO EXPLAIN WHY STOCK MARKET IS BOOMING DESPITE TRUMP TARIFFS With Nevada being the state with the highest share of tipped workers in the country, these comments ignited a firestorm of criticisms from Republican voices online. \"Marvel at just how out of touch Democrats are with reality. The DCCC thinks no taxes on tips is ‘crumbs,’\" wrote conservative commentator Steve Guest. \"What makes this so bad, is that this is ACTUALLY what the Democrat party thinks,\" wrote White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson. National Republican Senatorial Committee advisor Nathan Brand added, \"Nancy Pelosi peddled this same elitist ‘crumbs’ message in 2017 after Trump and Republicans cut taxes for nearly all working families.\" The Republican Congressional Leadership Fund challenged Titus, Lee and Horsford, saying, \"Will you denounce the @dccc’s statement that cutting taxes on tips amounts to ‘crumbs?’ Many of your constituents rely on tips to support their families.\" National Republican Congressional Campaign Committee spokesman Christian Gonzalez wrote, \"The @dccc sneering that No Tax on Tips is ‘crumbs’ is peak Democrat elitism.\" KAMALA HARRIS-ENDORSED CANDIDATE IN HOT SEAT FOR MILLION-DOLLAR DC HOME HUNDREDS OF MILES OUTSIDE DISTRICT Though all three Democrats have advocated for the no tax on tips policy, they voted against the big, beautiful bill in which the policy was included. Gonzalez said that the Nevada Democrats’ \"voting record says it all\" and that \"Out of touch Democrats Dina Titus, Susie Lee, and Steven Horsford are too scared of their radical, latte-sipping bosses in D.C. to stand with the workers who keep Nevada running.\" \"Only a party run by latte-liberals who refuse to go into the office thinks hard-earned tip money is pocket lint,\" he said. The NRCC itself also asked: \"Will Titus, Lee, and Horsford stand with workers?\" \"National Democrats just mocked Nevada’s servers, bartenders, cooks, housekeepers, dealers, and hospitality workers, sneering that their right to keep their own hard-earned tip money amounts to nothing more than ‘crumbs,’\" the NRCC said in a statement. \"This is the shameless party of Dina Titus, Susie Lee, and Steven Horsford. They can’t hide from their vote AGAINST No Tax on Tips for hardworking Nevadans. If Titus, Lee, and Horsford actually stood with workers, they’d condemn these comments and stand up for workers keeping more of their hard-earned money,\" the NRCC went on. 'SQUAD' DEM SPENDS EYE-POPPING AMOUNT ON LUXURY LIMO SERVICES IN ONE YEAR After its passage, Lee wrote in the Las Vegas Sun that she \"rushed back to Washington to vote against the One Big Beautiful Bill,\" calling it \"one of the least popular pieces of legislation in modern American history, giving massive, permanent tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans and temporary crumbs for working families in Southern Nevada.\" In August, the three sent a letter to U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent \"to ensure the successful implementation\" of the no-tax-on-tips policy. In a statement, Lee’s office said the letter highlighted that \"the version of ‘No Tax on Tips’ passed by Republicans in Washington does not fully meet the needs of Nevadans.\" In a statement to Fox News Digital, Lee said, \"I believe that no one should lose out on tips they earned. That’s why I support the TIPS Act to PERMANENTLY end taxes on tips.\" She said that earlier this year, she \"called on Speaker [Mike] Johnson to bring the permanent fix ‘No Tax on Tips Act’ — which unanimously passed the Senate — to the House floor for a vote.\" PROGRESSIVE DEMOCRATS TURN ON PARTY LEADERSHIP AFTER GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN ENDS WITHOUT HEALTHCARE GUARANTEES \"Instead, Republican leaders held it hostage so they could provide cover for themselves as they voted to pass the largest transfer of wealth in American history,\" she said, adding, \"The Republican ‘no tax on tips’ provision is a raw deal for tipped earners — it’s temporary, capped, and so much smaller than the tax breaks the wealthiest Americans got out of the Big Bulls**t Bill.\" \"Let me be clear — our service workers can’t benefit from no tax on tips if they aren’t receiving tips thanks to our tourism slump or if they’ve lost their jobs,\" she said. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP DCCC spokeswoman Lindsay Reilly also responded to the backlash, telling Fox News Digital \"it’s sad that the out-of-touch operatives at the NRCC are having a meltdown when confronted with the facts.\" \"Everyone knows the Big, Ugly Bill is a massive tax giveaway for the wealthiest few that sticks working families with the bill. That is fact, and it’s why everyone hates it,\" she said, adding, \"Voters can see through Republicans’ cheap spin and people know their bill fails to deliver meaningful relief to everyday Americans, while the billionaires cash out.\" In response to the knock on her 2017 \"crumbs\" comment, Pelosi’s office shared a statement from 2018, which accused President Donald Trump’s first-term tax breaks of being a scam and \"a monumental theft from the middle class to enrich the wealthiest 1 percent.\" Fox News Digital also reached out to Titus and Horsford, but did not immediately receive a response.","summary":"Nevada Democratic representatives Dina Titus, Susie Lee and Steven Horsford are being mocked as “out of touch&quot; for keeping silent after a Democratic spokesperson dismissed no tax on tips as “crumbs.&quot;","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democrats-mocked-out-touch-comments-dismissing-no-tax-tips-peak-elitism","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/11/titus-lee-horsford.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-14 23:50:50","author":"Peter Pinedo","authors":["Peter Pinedo"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.203},{"id":379129766,"title":"Stephen King&#039;s Post Mocking Donald Trump&#039;s Face Takes Off Online","text":"Author Stephen King’s latest post mocking President Donald Trump’s face went viral on social media platform X this week.\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nKing, the famed horror writer, has emerged as a staunch Trump critic and frequently speaks out against the president on social media. He posts regularly go viral, attracting support from fellow Democrats and rebuke from Republicans.\n\nWhat To Know\n\n“George Orwell said the face you show the world at 50 is the face you deserve,” King wrote in Wedesday’s post. “Take a good look at Donald Trump’s. It’s the puffy, pouch-eyed face of an aging satyr,” King wrote.\n\nWhite House spokesperson Abigail Jackson responded to King in a statement to Newsweek.\n\n“Since Stephen has spent so long writing fiction, it’s understandable that he’d have no grasp on reality,” she wrote.\n\nThe post was viewed more than 4.5 million times and received more than 3,500 comments from other users on X. Many of those comments appeared to be from conservatives who took issue with the post. Others posted photographs of Trump, who is 79, from when he was 50.\n\nAuthor Stephen King attends the premiere for “The Life of Chuck” in Toronto on September 6, 2024.\n\nEthan Nicolle, the former creative director at The Babylon Bee, a conservative satire website, responded, writing: “I mean if there was a Rushmore of odd faced 80’s celebrities you’d probably both be on it.” \n\nX user Steve Doyle wrote: “For a supposed legendary writer, he neither posts anything clever, nor even writes the drivel very well.”\n\nKing, who did not respond to critiques of his post, regularly trolls Trump and has been outspoken about his left-leaning political views in the past. He supported then-Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential race.\n\nOn November 4, he wrote: “Trump’s approval rating is down to 37%. Hope the poor guy has a scuba tank because he’s UNDERWATER. He wrote on November 8: “Trump wants the DC stadium named after himself. How about Felony Field?” In April, King condemned Trump’s tariffs in a post viewed more than 1.4 million times.\n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\nSteven Cheung, spokesperson for President Donald Trump, previously told Newsweek: “Stephen King is a dumba**.”\n\nStephen King told The Guardian in August what his ending would be for “Trumpian America”: “I think it would be impeachment, which, in my view, would be a good ending. I would love to see him retired, let’s put it that way. The bad ending would be that he gets a third term and takes things over completely. It’s a horror story either way. Trump is a horror story, isn’t he?”\n\nWhat Happens Next\n\nKing has already followed up with more posts about the Trump administration, responding to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi suing California over the state’s congressional map amid a redistricting arms race between Republicans and Democrats.

Alex Padilla (D-CA) announced he would not seek the post. Former Vice President Kamala Harris had also signaled she was interested in taking over Gov. Gavin Newsom‘s (D-CA) office when he is termed out in 2026, but ultimately decided against it. \n\nFormer Rep. Katie Porter (D-CA) is considered a Democratic contender, but her popularity has taken a hit after she made national headlines for nearly storming out of a CBS interview, and old footage of her berating a staffer resurfaced. \n\nSo far, there are 12 declared Democratic candidates and 11 declared Republican candidates. \n\n“I think he has a shot,” Lincoln Mitchell, a lecturer in the School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia University who has written extensively on California politics, told the Washington Examiner of Swalwell’s chances. “There is no clear front-runner, and he’s a skilled politician.”\n\nCalifornia’s gubernatorial primary isn’t until June 2, which gives hopefuls eight months to lay out policy agendas and appeal to voter concerns. The top two winners, regardless of party, will move on to the general election in November. \n\nJeff Le, managing principal at 100 Mile Strategies, told the Washington Examiner he’s heard Swalwell has been “testing his name in polling and surveys” and said the real indicator will be what the next major poll shows.\n\nDemocratic strategist Kaivan Shroff said that Swalwell has “played the new media game well” and thinks “his entrance into the race would be an early test of the influence of the media ecosystem the left has been building.” \n\n“He is a frequent guest on Meidas Touch, for example — but does that give him resonance beyond the very online Dem echo chamber?” he said to the Washington Examiner. “Certainly it will help with fundraising — but he hasn’t demonstrated too much range beyond that in the ways folks like [Rep.] Ro Khanna (D-CA) and others who ‘go everywhere’ in terms of media have. He would also have to have seriously improved his debate and campaigning chops from his presidential bid, which was surprisingly underwhelming.” \n\nFormer Fox News host Steve Hilton, a Republican candidate for governor, told the Washington Examiner that Swalwell’s possible entry into the race doesn’t really change the dynamics.\n\n“I’m excited to welcome Eric Swalwell to the governor’s race,” he said. “I’m sure he’ll bring plenty of energy, but as the latest poll shows, Californians are desperate for change after 15 years of corrupt Democratic one-party rule that’s left the state dead last in affordability and opportunity.

Born in Sac City, Iowa, Swalwell grew up in California as the eldest of four boys. A Division 1 soccer scholarship allowed him to become the first in his family to go to college. At the University of Maryland, he was an intern on Capitol Hill for the late Rep. Ellen Tauscher (D-CA). After graduating from law school, Swalwell went to work as a prosecutor in the Alameda County District Attorney’s Office, where he led the hate crimes unit. \n\nIn Congress, Swalwell served eight years on the House Intelligence Committee, where he was the chairman and ranking member, overseeing the CIA. He helped lead the House Investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election and both impeachments of Trump. \n\nCalls to Swalwell’s office for confirmation by the Washington Examiner were not returned.","summary":"Rep.

California uses a jungle primary system, where all candidates, regardless of political party, run on a single ballot for the primary. The two candidates with the most support advance to the general election.\n\nCurrently, two Republicans—Steve Hilton and Riverside Sheriff Chad Bianco—are in the race.\n\nThere are five prominent Democrats, including former Representative Katie Porter, former Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, former Comptroller Betty Yee, and former Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond. Others, including Representative Eric Swalwell and businessman Rick Caruso, have also been floated as potential candidates.\n\nThe concern for Democrats would be the high number of candidates running, splitting up the vote, and giving an opportunity for two Republicans to advance to the general election, and that they would be locked out of the governorship in a race they would otherwise be favored in. The latest polls have shown that two of the three leading candidates are Republicans.\n\nWhat to Know\n\nThe latest poll of the race comes from EMC Research and was reported by Punchbowl News after reports that Swalwell could jump into the race. It showed Hilton with 20 percent support, while Porter and Bianco followed at 16 percent and 14 percent. Swalwell polled at 11 percent, while other candidates were in the single digits.\n\nThat shows a tight race between Porter and Bianco for the second spot in the general election—something Democrats will be trying to avoid ahead of next year’s primary.\n\nSteve Hilton, a candidate for governor in California, attends the Los Angeles premiere of “Reagan” on August 20, 2024.\n\nIt surveyed 1,000 likely voters from October 22-26 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.\n\nTwo other recent polls have illustrated similar dynamics.\n\nA poll conducted by Democratic pollster Ben Tulchin on behalf of Villaraigosa’s campaign. It showed Bianco leading with 20 percent, followed by Villaraigosa at 19 percent and Hilton at 18 percent. It surveyed 919 likely voters in November and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points.\n\nAn Emerson College poll showed Hilton with 16 percent, Porter with 15 percent and Bianco with 11 percent support in the primary. It surveyed 900 likely voters from October 20-21 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.19 percentage points.\n\nA University of California, Berkeley poll showed Bianco leading with 13 percent, while Porter followed with 11 percent. Becerra and Hilton both followed with eight percent support. It surveyed 8,141 registered voters from October 20-27. It has a sampling error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.\n\nPorter was viewed as the frontrunner, but has recently faced criticism after threatening to leave an interview after becoming frustrated by a journalist’s follow-up questions. The backlash also saw other allegations of mistreatment resurface amid her campaign.\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris was also viewed as a possible candidate but declined to run.\n\nDarry A. Sragow, a Democratic strategist, told Newsweek polls told Newsweek polls this far out “have no relevance.”\n\n“They confirm that the race for governor in California is totally up for grabs because virtually nobody other than political insiders has any idea whatsoever of who these candidates are and what they stand for,” he said. “There are roughly twice as many registered Democrats as registered Republicans in California and consequently there is a strong possibility that the general election battle next November will exclude a Republican.”\n\nIt remains to be seen who can raise sufficient money to compete in California and who else may join the field, he said.\n\nDemocratic commentator Russell Drew wrote on Friday on X that polling numbers may be concerning for the party.\n\n“Easy to see how the two major Republican candidates for California governor squeeze into the top two with 20% and 19% of the vote, therefore locking Democrats out of November. If you’re a Dem running at 5% or less before the March filing deadline, drop out,” he wrote.\n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\nJacob Rubashkin, deputy editor for Inside Elections, wrote to X: “A primary with 8 viable Democratic candidates and only 2 viable Republicans might cause some unpleasant ou...","summary":"Several candidates are running to replace Governor Gavin Newsom, who is term-limited, in the 2026 midterms.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/republicans-lead-four-california-governor-race-polls-11051201","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2167725106.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-14 20:22:53","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.144},{"id":379099302,"title":"Okay, Now It’s Confirmed: Trump Is Driving Leftists CRAZY","text":"The news is not unexpected in the least, given the maniacal hatred that leftists have directed at Donald Trump ever since he first announced that he was running for president in 2015, and even before then, when he dared not to strike the appropriate posture of awe and reverence before the august personage of Barack Hussein Obama. Now, however, a psychotherapist has confirmed it: hatred of the president is driving leftists stark, raving mad.\n\nCollin Rugg of Trending Politics noted Friday that “psychotherapist Jonathan Alpert says that 75% of the patients he sees have a deep hatred for Trump and are ‘hyper fixated’ on him.” They hate him, but he is, after all, president of the United States, and they can’t bear to stop following politics closely enough to regain some perspective and serenity. \"They can't sleep,” Alpert said on Fox News, because “they feel traumatized by Mr. Trump.\" \n\nAlpert said: \"I had one patient who said she couldn't enjoy a vacation because anytime she saw Trump in the news or on her device, she felt triggered…. So this is a profound pathology, and I would even go so far as to call it the defining pathology of our time.\" That’s right. Trump Derangement Syndrome isn’t just a phrase patriots use to mock leftists anymore. It’s a real malady, and it deserves a place in the next edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the basic handbook for mental health workers.\n\nNEW: Psychotherapist Jonathan Alpert says that 75% of the patients he sees have a deep hatred for Trump and are \"hyper fixated\" on him.\"They can't sleep, they feel traumatized by Mr. Trump.\"\"I had one patient who said she couldn't enjoy a vacation because anytime she saw… pic.twitter.com/q4n3KMtzFV— Collin Rugg (@CollinRugg) November 14, 2025\n\nWhy do leftists suffer from this, while patriots have endured the misrule of Bill Clinton, Obama, and Old Joe Biden without being driven totally around the bend? There are many reasons for that, chief among them being the fact that patriots generally tend to be religious people, while leftists are not. A key element of both Judaism and Christianity is the idea is that human beings are flawed to the extent that it is not possible to establish a perfect society on earth.\n\nThe awareness of human frailty also prevents patriots from both mistaking politicians for gods, while a hallmark of leftist regimes in the modern age has been the cult of personality. Leftism contends that the perfect society — be it the workers’ paradise of Marxism or some DEI palace of equity that soothes the nightmares of the likes of Kamala Harris — can actually be established on earth.\n\nWhen it is established, it will be the work of a benign human god such as Lenin, Stalin, Mao, Kim Jong Un or some other leftist tyrant; all of these and others have demanded, and received, worshipful adoration from their people. In their officially atheist regimes, these leaders (and other leftists who have risen to the top in totalitarian regimes) have clearly endeavored to take the place of God in their hearts and minds of those over whom they rule. \n\nOf course, American leftists don’t go in for that kind of cultic activity, right? Sure. The next time you’re in a conversation with a leftist, say something disparaging about Barack Obama and watch what happens. This leader-worship, meanwhile, has a flip side. These ersatz leftist religions not only need a god; they need a devil, too — someone upon whom everything can be blamed. George Orwell indelibly captured this impulse in 1984 with the “Two Minutes Hate,” during which the citizens of the totalitarian state of Oceania were compelled to scream invective at Emanuel Goldstein, the enemy of the regime and of all that was good. \n\nWho is Donald Trump but the left’s real-life Emanuel Goldstein today? Leftists who can’t sleep at night because thoughts of Trump torment them are caught up in a frenzy of religious fanaticism, consumed with hatred for the Satan figure of the left’s secular religion.\n\nRelated: Trump Asks Supreme Court to Throw Out the Worst Biden-Era Miscarriage of Justice Against Him \n\nThat means that the only real and lasting cure to Trump Derangement Syndrome is to take a step back and realize that human society is not actually perfectible. The workers’ paradise of Marx and his children and heirs is a pipe dream. Trying to establish a perfect world of justice and equity has only resulted in piles of corpses and millions of ruined lives. Neither Lenin nor Mao nor even Barack Obama is the good leader who will usher in the new age of righteousness, and Trump is not the devil. \n\nAbove all, leftists should look back into the family history and discover the religion that they or their parents discarded, and take it up again. This will do them a world of good to see Trump, even as they continue to oppose him, in a more realistic and saner light. Who knows? They might even be able to get a good night’s sleep.\n\nRemember: when you get your news from the establishment media, you're relying on people who are very likely TDS sufferers.

In fact, costs under the TRUMP ADMINISTRATION are tumbling down, helped greatly by gasoline and ENERGY. Affordability is a lie when used by the Dems. It is a complete CON JOB. Thanksgiving costs are 25% lower this year than last, under Crooked Joe! We are the Party of Affordability!”\n\nOf course, this is objectively not true. In September’s Consumer Price Index report, which was the last full measure of inflation before the government shutdown began, showed inflation ticked up 0.3 percent. \n\nBut Trump is trying to commit an act of political acrobatics after Democrats swept every major election last week based on one word: affordability, which Trump has criticized. And it reveals that Trump is now facing the same doom loop on inflation that his predecessor Joe Biden faced that ultimately doomed his presidency. \n\nAn AP-NORC poll released on Thursday showed that Trump’s approval is now at a dismal 36 percent and 62 percent disapprove of his performance as president. His numbers are even worse when it comes to the economy, where approval sits at 33 percent. \n\nTrump largely won because of the economic malaise people felt in 2024 after years of rising inflation. Biden for his part tried selling that the economy was great, even when people felt the sting of the price of groceries and gas. He even tried to co-opt The Wall Street Journal’s derisive term “Bidenomics” as his own.\n\nIt ended in disaster because instead of convincing people that the economy was getting better, he wound up owning all of the worst aspects of the economy. \n\nRather than pointing to the economy’s real successes like reduced unemployment and wage growth while also acknowldging the genuine problems of inflation, Biden’s team painted a hunky-dory picture. When Kamala Harris said she could name anything that she would do differently, it doomed her presidential campaign as well. \n\nNow Trump is trying to use the same spin as Biden. On Thursday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the October Consumer Price Index, which tracks inflation, might never be released, Leavitt faulted the government shutdown, which ended Wednesday. \n\nMore pain is likely to come. A report from Goldman Sachs showed last month that companies have only passed 37 percent of the cost from Trump’s tariffs down to consumers. Companies so far have likely hoped that Trump would broker new trade deals or they lived by the acronym of TACO or “Trump always chckens out. But soon, they won’t be able to shoulder the cost and pass even more onto the consumer. \n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent has tried to calm down markets and told Fox & Friends this week that the administration would slash tariffs on coffee, bananas and other fruits that cannot be grown in the United States. \n\nBut this would not be an issue for the Trump administration had Trump not done across-the-board tariffs which caused the price of coffee to jump by double digits.\n\nThere’s also a hidden trap-door on affordability and cost that should make Trump sweat through his bronzer: health care. For the past month and a half, Democrats blocked efforts to reopen the government in the name of forcing Republicans to renew enhanced Covid-era tax credits for the Affordable Care Act’s insurance market. \n\nThey even found an unlikely ally in Marjorie Taylor Greene, the MAGA firebrand, who criticized the fact premiums might double or in some cases triple. \n\nWell, the government’s reopen and while Senate Republicans pledged to vote on the subsidies in December, there’s no guarantee 13 Republicans will join Democrats to extend them, and House Speaker Mike Johnson would still have to put it up for a vote.\n\nTrump’s entire existence on the political scene has been an example of defying the laws of political physics. But a president can only defy the gravity of a bad economy for so long. \n\nAnd the American voters is an consumer first and foremost who will not tolerate increased prices and a sluggish labor market. While Trump cannot run for re-election, angry voters could easily elect Democrats to the House and even the Senate, hampering his presidency or erase his agenda. He just needs to give Joe Biden a call.","summary":"It doesn’t matter how much Trump talks about how costs are going down.

Democrats are optimistic that the national environment will favor them, as the party in the White House typically loses seats during the midterms. The new poll underscores how close the race may be.\n\nA spokesperson for state Senator Mallory McMorrow told Newsweek that polls show she “has the momentum in the primary and is the only candidate who beats Rogers in the general [election].” \n\nJoetta Appiah, a spokesperson for U.S. Representative Haley Stevens, wrote in a statement that the new poll shows she is “the strongest candidate to defeat Rogers and keep Michigan’s must-win Senate seat blue.”\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nDemocrats holding onto the Michigan seat is key in their efforts to reclaim control of the Senate in next year’s midterms.\n\nMichigan is one of the nation’s closest swing states, having backed both Democrats and Republicans in recent statewide elections. President Donald Trump carried it in his 2016 and 2024 presidential bids, but former President Joe Biden won it in 2020—all three races were decided by small margins.\n\nRepublican U.S. Senate candidate and former U.S. Representative Mike Rogers speaks in Byron Center, Michigan, on August 14, 2024.\n\nWhat To Know\n\nThree prominent Democrats are running in the primary. In addition to Stevens and McMorrow, progressive candidate Abdul El-Sayed is running, though he was not included in the poll released on Friday. Rogers, a former congressman who lost the Senate race last November against Democrat Elissa Slotkin, is viewed as the leading Republican candidate.\n\nThe poll, conducted by EPIC-MRA and originally published in the Detroit Free Press, showed Rogers narrowly trails Stevens and McMorrow. Stevens, who represents an Oakland County-based district composed of Detroit suburbs, led Rogers by 2 percentage points (44-42). McMorrow, who holds a suburban seat in the state Senate, held a 1-point lead over Rogers (43-42). The poll surveyed 600 Michigan residents from November 6-11 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.\n\nDavid Dulio, a political science professor and director of the Center for Civic Engagement at Oakland University, told Newsweek on Friday that the race is going to be “very close.”\n\n“Michigan has always been a competitive state, and we’ve seen in the last couple of Senate races closer than anticipated results,” he said.\n\nMcMorrow and El-Sayed are vying for support from progressives, while Stevens is presenting herself as more of a traditional Democrat. Who would be the strongest candidate is yet to be determined, Dulio said, noting that the Democrats are still searching for what they want the party to be moving forward.\n\n“The tension that’s there between the factions in the Democratic Party [is] going to be on display in this primary” he said.\n\nTrump won Michigan by about 1.4 percentage points last November as former Vice President Kamala Harris struggled in areas like Dearborn, which has a large Muslim-American community, over backlash to the Biden administration’s support for Israel.\n\nAt the same time, Slotkin defeated Rogers by less than a half-point.\n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\nHannah Lindow, communications director for Mallory McMorrow’s campaign, told Newsweek: “Recent polls show that Senator McMorrow has the momentum in the primary and is the only candidate who beats Rogers in the general. She is precisely the type of leader Michiganders are hungry for in this moment—someone who can both fight and deliver on issues like health care and rising costs.”\n\nJoetta Appiah, spokesperson for Haley Stevens’ campaign, in a statement: “This is the latest poll confirming that Haley Stevens is the strongest candidate to defeat Mike Rogers and keep Michigan’s must-win Senate seat blue. While Mike Rogers wants to rubber-stamp Trump’s price-hiking, chaos agenda, Haley Stevens is focused on lowering costs, shaping the future of Michigan’s manufacturing economy, and building a wide coalition of support on the ground.”\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent, endorsed Abdul El-Sayed in April: “During this unprecedented moment in American history, we need candidates who will fight for the working class. Dr. @AbdulElSayed is that leader. He will take on powerful special interests & build a government that work for all of us, not the few. I am proud to support him.”\n\nSenator Martin Heinrich, a New Mexico Democrat, endorsed McMorrow: “We need leaders with the energy to fight, the experience to deliver, and the courage to call B.S. when they see it.

Their conclusion challenges the conventional wisdom that dominated economic policy debates in recent years: when countries raise tariffs, prices actually fall, not rise.\n\n“We find that a tariff hike raises unemployment and lowers inflation,” the authors, Régis Barnichon and Aayush Singh, write in their working paper released this month.”This goes against the predictions of standard models, whereby CPI inflation should go up in response to higher tariffs.”\n\nThe finding arrives at a politically charged moment. As the Trump administration has implemented tariff increases averaging 18 percent on U.S. imports in 2025, mainstream economists warned of a significant inflationary spiral. The Federal Reserve officials have repeatedly said they have hesitated to cut interest rates because they expect tariffs to push up prices.\n\nMore recently, several Fed officials have said that they think the central bank should not cut interest rates further due to what they believed would be inflationary pressures from tariffs.\n\nBut the historical evidence suggests those concerns may have rested on shaky theoretical foundations not backed by evidence.\n\nThe Tarifflation Story Was Upside Down\n\nThe researchers’ approach was ingenious. Rather than trying to parse recent decades of limited tariff variation, they exploited massive swings in tariff policy across centuries, using these shifts as a natural experiment to understand cause and effect.\n\nThe key insight came from American political history. Throughout the 19th century and into the 1930s, Republicans and Democrats held fundamentally opposite views about tariffs. Republicans, representing industrial interests in the North, favored high tariffs for protection. Democrats, representing the agricultural South, opposed them as harmful to farmers and consumers.\n\nThis partisan divide created something economists rarely find: quasi-random variation in policy. When recessions hit, the political response to higher unemployment depended on which party was in power—not on any consistent economic logic. Republicans would raise tariffs to protect workers; Democrats would lower them for the same reason.\n\n“Since recessions did not favor one party over another, there was no general relation between the direction of tariff changes and the state of the economy,” the authors explain. This meant they could use straightforward statistical methods to isolate tariff effects, without worrying that policy makers were adjusting tariffs in response to economic conditions.\n\nThey also identified eight major tariff changes explicitly motivated by long-term political considerations rather than cyclical pressures—from the McKinley Tariff of 1890 to the recent Trump tariffs of 2018—and analyzed those separately. Both approaches yielded the same surprising result.\n\nThe Inflation Puzzle\n\nUsing a standard economic model, researchers estimated the effect of tariff shocks on inflation and unemployment. A roughly 4 percentage point increase in average tariffs lowered inflation by about 2 percentage points while raising unemployment by about 1 percentage point, they found.\n\nThe results held across different time periods. Whether examining the first wave of globalization before 1913, the interwar period, or the modern post-World War II era, the pattern remained consistent: higher tariffs correlated with lower prices and weaker economic activity.\n\n“These findings point towards tariff shocks acting through an aggregate demand channel,” the authors conclude.\n\nIn other words, tariffs appear to work like a demand shock rather than a cost-push shock. Standard economic theory predicts that tariffs should raise costs for businesses, which then pass higher prices to consumers. But the historical record suggests something different: tariff increases create uncertainty, depress consumer and investor confidence, and reduce overall spending. Lower demand then exerts downward pressure on prices.\n\nThe researchers found evidence supporting this mechanism. When tariffs increased, stock prices fell and market volatility spiked—consistent with an uncertainty shock dampening economic sentiment.\n\nA Reconsideration of Trade Theory\n\nThe paper’s findings overturn decades of consensus among mainstream economists about tariff effects. Trade theory has long held that tariffs are economically inefficient, raising consumer prices while reducing overall prosperity. Yet this study of 150 years of actual tariff episodes suggests the real-world effects are far more complex than textbook models suggest.\n\nThe research reveals that tariff shocks operate primarily through aggregate demand mechanisms—affecting confidence, investment, and spending patterns—rather than through the simple cost-push mechanism that trade models emphasize. This distinction matters enormously. It means that tariffs can be used as a policy tool without triggering the consumer price spirals that economists have warned about for generations.\n\nThe study’s authors note the surprising scarcity of rigorous empirical research on tariff effects. “There is surprisingly little empirical evidence on the aggregate macroeconomic effects of tariff changes,” they observe, “with most studies focused on partial equilibrium effects.”\n\nBy grounding their analysis in historical evidence rather than theoretical assumptions, Barnichon and Singh have forced a reckoning with how much the policy consensus rested on untested premises.\n\n“The results are more uncertain” in the modern period, the authors acknowledge, because tariff variation has been so limited since World War II. But the point estimates still point in the same direction: higher tariffs are associated with lower inflation and weaker activity.\n\nA Challenge to the Establishment Consensus\n\nThe paper comes at a moment when the economic consensus faces increasing scrutiny. For decades, mainstream economists have dominated policy debates, and their models—which predicted significant consumer price increases from 2025 tariff hikes—shaped expectations and Fed decisions.\n\nYet the historical evidence suggests those models may have been built on faulty foundations.\n\nThe authors meticulously tested their findings against various alternative explanations and methodological approaches. Each time, the core result persisted: tariff increases lower inflation and raise unemployment. This consistency across centuries, countries, and identification strategies gives the findings substantial credibility.\n\nWhat emerges is a picture of tariffs far more complex than opponents have typically acknowledged. Rather than a crude tool that raises prices and harms consumers, tariffs appear to operate through sophisticated demand-side mechanisms that reshape economic activity in ways economists are only beginning to understand.\n\nTariffs in a New Light\n\nThe findings reframe the debate over trade policy fundamentally. Long-term structural effects of tariffs may differ from short-run price and employment impacts, reorienting the economy towards more domestic production and less dependence on foreign manufacturers. A long-neglected idea known as optimal trade theory has long suggested that tariffs can be used by large economies to improve their terms of trade, forcing foreign producers to offer goods at lower prices. And tariffs may productively redistribute economic activity toward domestic industries and manufacturing sectors that economists might otherwise overlook.\n\nMore importantly, the study removes the most potent intellectual weapon from the free-trade arsenal: the claim that tariffs inevitably raise consumer prices. For generations, this assertion ended policy debates before they could begin. Policymakers considering tariffs faced the accusation that they were imposing a regressive tax on consumers. Kamala Harris, in her failed bid for the presidency last year, repeatedly described Trump’s tariff proposals as a national sales tax that would increase consumer prices. Now that idea lies in tatters.\n\nWith the consumer price argument dismantled, the debate over tariffs can proceed on grounds better rooted in economic history and national purpose. Policymakers can weigh the benefits of protecting domestic industries, rebalancing trade relationships, and rebuilding manufacturing capacity against the effects on economic activity and employment. They can consider whether tariffs might encourage productive investment and industrial development—questions that have been largely off-limits in mainstream economic discourse.\n\nThe paper’s findings also call into question the Fed’s response to tariffs. If the main effects are lower inflation and higher lower employment, monetary theory would suggest that the Fed should cut interest rates when tariffs are imposed. Instead, the Fed this year took the opposite course, holding interest rates steady and only cutting hesitantly—moves that now look like a major policy mistake.","summary":"Researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco examined major tariff changes from 1870 through 2020 across the United States, United Kingdom, and France.

Former President Joe Biden, who beat him in that race, appointed him as the top transportation official during his administration. In the 2024 presidential election, he was among a group of contenders for the vice presidency under Kamala Harris, who ultimately picked Minnesota Gov.

The Democratic Party should be redesigned to focus on addressing the issues gripping everyday American life, he said. \n\n“All of these things that are happening now, obviously, I will argue why Trump policies and Republican policies tend to make them worse,” he said. “But they also tend to create an environment where a lot of people who don’t even like him will say, ‘You know what?

He believes that, for instance, the George Clooney op-ed, that was such a big moment where Clooney calls on Biden to drop out.”\n\nHunter Biden, the former president’s son, also told Karl that he became incensed when Obama led Biden off the stage after they both appeared at a fundraiser, saying, “You don’t grab the President of the United States like that.”\n\n“So it's not a good relationship. If they had wanted to see each other, they absolutely would have,” Karl added. \n\nKarl further stated that Biden and those in his orbit still believed he could win the 2024 election even after his disastrous debate performance and the fact that his cognitive decline was on full display. \n\n“By the way, when he finally made that decision, he calls Kamala Harris and says he's dropping out,” Karl explained. “Kamala Harris really pushes him to make the endorsement immediately, which he ultimately does.” \n\nThere's been a lot of talk on how Kamala Harris sat down and made over 100 phone calls to get people to support her campaign and to get started. But Biden made a whole bunch of phone calls that night, too. I was astounded to hear that one person he did not call was Barack Obama, the person that really made it possible for him to be President by making him vice President.

He told Biden that it would be extremely difficult to defeat Hillary Clinton in the primaries. Obama also waited to endorse Biden in the 2020 primary race, which Biden interpreted as a lack of faith.\n\nBiden was also frustrated that Obama did not bother to call him after his disaster of a debate performance against Trump. A Biden White House official also said Obama “created tension during his visits, acting as if he still held authority.”\n\nTo sum it up, it appears Biden believes Obama was never fully in his corner — and he resents it.

They are now one of just eight teams remaining in the Michigan High School Athletic Association (MHSAA) Division I girls tournament, the highest level in the state. The MHSAA requires transgender athletes to have an approved waiver to compete in any organization-sponsored events, which include the district and regional tournaments. The organization said in September that it had not granted any waivers since last fall (waivers have to be approved every year), but has ignored multiple follow-up requests asking if one has since been granted. As OutKick has reported throughout the fall season, Skyline appears to have attempted to hide its biological male player's identity, with many parents of opposing teams expressing outrage when they discovered their teenage girls were competing against a male. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM The trans-identifying player, who OutKick is not naming because the athlete is believed to be a minor, dominated the first set with several massive kills, helping Skyline cruise to the first set win, 25-15. Every time the player spiked the ball, though, the frustration on the faces of those in the Saline cheering section was evident. One parent kept holding two thumbs down every time the player made a key play. Another parent saw the player spike a ball and turned to her husband and quietly said, \"That's the boy, right?\" However, after Skyline won the first set, it appeared the team was less inclined to set that player up for spikes. While the trans-identifying player wasn't the most dominant on the court – perhaps intentionally – the advantages in jumping and hitting ability from the male player over the female players was clear. \"As you saw, it was actually a pretty even match when he wasn't on the court,\" one Saline parent told me after the match. LAWYER IN SCOTUS TRANS ATHLETE BATTLE, ICONS ACTIVISTS REACT TO REPORTS IOC WILL PROTECT WOMEN'S CATEGORY Another person in attendance remarked, \"I've never seen a girl jump that high.\" Unfortunately, as much as it seemed clear that several Saline parents wanted to voice their frustrations, most shied away. One told me that as much as they'd like to make their feelings known, they feared that their children might face retribution. Part of the issue in reporting this story is that all the schools Skyline has played so far in the MHSAA tournament are in or around Ann Arbor. Several people commented on X, jokingly referring to the city as \"The People's Republic of Ann Arbor\" because of its radical left-wing political culture. Parents are scared that speaking out against the radical left-wing ideology will put their children in harm's way. It's hard to blame them for feeling that way. But things are about to change. Skyline will face Byron Center in the state quarterfinal on Nov. 18 at Gull Lake High School in Richland, Mich. While Ann Arbor overwhelmingly voted for Kamala Harris in the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election (71 percent in Washtenaw County, which encompasses Ann Arbor), Byron Center High School is located in Kent County. Kent County was much more divided (52 percent to 47 percent in favor of Harris). CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP But Byron Center is located very near the border of two other counties, Allegan and Barry. Both decidedly voted for Donald Trump (64 percent and 66 percent respectively). It'll be interesting to see what happens once Skyline gets outside its bubble. Inside its bubble, spectators harassed me for doing my job and were, in my opinion, practically encouraged by Skyline principal Casey Elmore. Why wouldn't they?

Literally today.\n\n“America First? Some Trump Supporters Worry That’s No Longer the Case.” —The New York Times\n\n“Trump faces heat from MAGA base on ‘America First’ agenda, Epstein” —The Washington Post\n\n“Trump defends his MAGA bona fides amid backlash from his base” —NBC News\n\n“‘Where is my president?’: Some MAGA supporters in uproar over Trump’s H-1B visa comments” —ABC News\n\nAs a representative sample, here’s how The New York Times leads off its article:\n\nPresident Trump has been dining with Wall Street bigwigs. He has embarked on an opulent revamp of the White House at a time when Americans are struggling to pay their bills. He has expressed support for granting visas to skilled foreigners to take jobs in the United States. He approved a $20 billion bailout for Argentina, helping a foreign government and wealthy investors at a moment when the U.S. government was shut down.\n\nFor a president who returned to office promising to avoid foreign entanglements, make life more affordable and ensure that available jobs go to American citizens, it has been a significant departure from the expectations of his loyal base. And it is starting to open a rift with his supporters who were counting on a more aggressively populist agenda.\n\nThe divisions within Mr. Trump’s movement, spawned by his own actions, have been only amplified by the latest developments on a story that he has been doing his best to quash: his relationship with the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThe other stories all start out with similar litanies of Trump’s alleged divergence from MAGA priorities. But Trump isn’t buying it. “Don’t forget, MAGA was my idea,” Trump told Fox News host Laura Ingraham this week. “I know what MAGA wants better than anybody else.”\n\nThat’s certainly true, but it’s also true that Trump is often his own worst enemy. In his first term, he would routinely achieve great conservative policy successes only to say something crazy and divert all media attention to that, rather than to his victories. In his second term, he’s been far less conservative in his governance — prioritizing executive power, often leaning into overreach with a strong dose of vengeance — and both have caused his early-term support to slide significantly.\n\nBut is this “MAGA crisis” just media hype meant to distract from Democrats’ colossal failure on the Schumer Shutdown?\n\nYes and no.\n\nFirst, the no. It’s not merely media misdirection to say that Trump has not really upheld his (albeit rash) promise to lower prices (a.k.a. focus on affordability) on Day One. Inflation is stubbornly persistent, sitting at about 3% — or 50% higher than the Federal Reserve’s targeted rate of 2%. Cumulative inflation since Joe Biden and Crew “rescued” America is almost 25%, and most Americans are tired of everything feeling unaffordable.\n\nTrump has offered tariff “rebates” and 50-year mortgages in a tacit admission that affordability is a problem, but he also seems to have settled on the same strategy that cost Joe Biden and Kamala Harris dearly in 2024 — namely that inflation isn’t a problem anymore and even that grocery prices are “way down.” Overall, that’s simply not true. Neither was it true when Biden repeatedly insisted that inflation was “down,” though I don’t recall quite such eager fact-checking from the likes of The New York Times.\n\nAs for the White House ballroom, however, that is Leftmedia churn. The primary ones hysterically sobbing about that are leftists who need psychiatric counseling for Trump Derangement Syndrome. The rest of us know it’s a useful addition paid for via private funds. No big deal.\n\nThe Jeffrey Epstein saga is actually both. Trump’s Justice Department spectacularly failed earlier this year in its supposedly explosive release, but so did Democrats with their dud of a distraction earlier this week. Some MAGA folks are indeed getting impatient with Trump over the release of material, but if that’s what actually divides anyone from Trump, then perhaps they were allies not worth having in the first place.\n\nMoving on to the foreign policy disagreements. Yes, there are some MAGA Republicans who have decided to transition from America First to America Only. Marjorie Taylor Greene is chief among them, though she’s sounding more like a Democrat than a Republican these days. Trump also had a completely mainstream Republican response: “When you’re president, you really sort of have to watch over the world because you’re going to be dragged into it.” He added, “When somebody makes a statement about, ‘he’s devoting time to the world,’ well, the world is the United States.”\n\nTrump’s moves in the Middle East (especially allying with Israel), orchestrating peace deals, helping Argentina, and so forth are all aimed at strengthening America’s position in the world. Frankly, Trump’s foreign policy has been his best aspect in this second term.\n\nFinally, let’s consider immigration. Trump told Ingraham that “you also do have to bring in talent” with H-1B visas. “Well, we have plenty of talented people here,” Ingraham said. “No, you don’t,” Trump shot back. “No, you don’t.” \n\nThat sparked a fair bit of backlash from the Right. Our Emmy Griffin unpacks that in greater detail today, but for my purposes, I’ll just say that Trump doesn’t explain himself very well. He assumes too much about whether people (i.e., his base) will understand what he means. In this case, many of them were just angry.\n\nHe was elected to fix two things: the economy and immigration. Most Americans wouldn’t give him an A on either issue. Leftmedia propaganda — especially on immigration — absolutely plays a role in that, but it’s not the only reason.\n\nOn the one hand, Trump can’t run for election again, so it matters little whether he retains unflagging support. On the other hand, the midterm elections are coming up, and presidents don’t historically do well in them. The GOP Senate might be safe, but the House is definitely not. If Trump truly wants to put America First, he will work hard to improve his results on the issues above so that he can build momentum in 2026.\n\nI hate to be Debbie Downer, but celebrating America’s 250th birthday could end on a sour note if we’re staring down two more years of gridlock and impeachment fiascos.\n\nFollow Nate Jackson on X.","url":"https://patriotpost.us/articles/122699-is-trump-vs-maga-a-leftmedia-hoax-2025-11-14","image":"https://img.patriotpost.us/01KA1GQZQGJM8NXQ95EN3BCR4M.jpeg?w=1200&h=630","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-14 16:06:53","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.349},{"id":379027260,"title":"Republicans’ Chances of Defeating Katie Hobbs in Arizona Governor Race—Poll","text":"Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, is in for a close race against Republican challengers in the 2026 midterm elections, according to a new poll.\n\nNewsweek reached out to Hobbs and the Republican candidates’ campaigns for comment via email.\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nArizona emerged as a key swing state over the past decade, with both parties scoring statewide victories. Last November, President Donald Trump carried the state by nearly six points, but Democrat Ruben Gallego eked out a win in the Senate race, a sign of how competitive the state can still be.\n\nHobbs, first elected in 2022, is up for reelection next year.

Prior to the election, Hobbs served as Arizona’s secretary of state and as a state legislator starting in 2011.\n\nSeveral Republicans are vying to challenge her, including Arizona Representatives Andy Biggs and David Schweikert, as well as attorney Karrin Taylor Robson. Trump has endorsed both Biggs and Robson.\n\nArizona Governor Katie Hobbs speaks in Tempe, Arizona, on September 28, 2023.\n\nThe Emerson poll showed Hobbs with a slight lead over each of the Republican candidates.\n\nShe held a single-point lead over Biggs (44 percent to 43 percent) and Robson (43 percent to 42 percent), and a five-point lead over Schweikert (44 percent to 39 percent), according to the poll. It surveyed 850 registered voters from November 8 to 10 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.3 percentage points.\n\nBiggs held a lead in the primary, with 50 percent of respondents saying they would vote for him. Meanwhile, Robson and Schweikert held 17 percent and 8 percent support, respectively, in the primary, the poll found.\n\nOther polls have also painted a picture of a close race. A Noble Predictive Insights poll, which surveyed 948 registered voters from August 11 to 18, showed Hobbs with a two-point lead over both Biggs (39 percent to 37 percent) and Robson (40 percent to 38 percent). It had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points.\n\nIn 2022, Hobbs defeated Lake by less than a single percentage point (50.3 percent to 49.7 percent) in what was one of the closest races across the country. Arizona was also one of the closest states at the presidential level in 2020—former President Joe Biden carried it by less than half a percentage point.\n\nIn 2024, however, Trump gained back ground in the state, winning 52.2 percent of the vote to former Vice President Kamala Harris’ 46.7 percent.\n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\nSpencer Kimball, director of the Emerson College poll, wrote in a report: “In a matchup between Hobbs and Biggs, voters who say the economy is their top issue break for Hobbs, 45% to 41%, while those who find immigration to be the top issue break for Biggs, 81% to 6%.”\n\nPresident Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social in April: “I like Karrin Taylor Robson of Arizona a lot, and when she asked me to Endorse her, with nobody else running, I Endorsed her, and was happy to do so.\n\n“When Andy Biggs decided to run for Governor, quite unexpectedly, I had a problem — Two fantastic candidates, two terrific people, two wonderful champions, and it is therefore my Great Honor TO GIVE MY COMPLETE AND TOTAL ENDORSEMENT TO BOTH. Either one will never let you down. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”\n\nWhat Happens Next\n\nThe Arizona race is likely to become closely watched—and expensive—as both parties try to win over voters over the coming year. Sabato’s Crystal Ball classifies the race as a pure toss-up.","summary":"A new poll showed a tight race between Hobbs and Republican challengers in the swing state of Arizona.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/republicans-chances-defeating-katie-hobbs-arizona-governor-race-poll-11048839","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-1695716504.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-14 16:02:19","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.172},{"id":379053056,"title":"Charlotte braces for surge of immigration agents as Trump's crackdown widens","text":"A surge of federal immigration agents could arrive in Charlotte, North Carolina, as soon as Saturday, Nov. 15, a local sheriff said, as President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown expands to more Democratic-run cities.\n\nMecklenburg County Sheriff Garry L. McFadden said two separate federal officials told him this week that U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) personnel will be arriving in the Charlotte area \"as early as this Saturday or the beginning of next week.\"\n\nMcFadden said federal officials have not disclosed any specific details about the operation, including how many agents will be sent to the city or what their mission will entail. The sheriff added that his agency will not be \"involved with any measures regarding enforcement with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and CBP.\"\n\nIn response to questions about the anticipated operation, Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for public affairs at the Department of Homeland Security said, \"We do not discuss future or potential operations.\"\n\nThe development comes as the Trump administration expands its deployment of federal agents into Democratic-led cities nationwide, including Los Angeles, Washington DC, Memphis, Chicago and Portland.\n\nCharlotte, the largest city in North Carolina, is a Democratic stronghold in a state that went to Trump in last year's presidential election. In Mecklenburg County, Democratic nominee Kamala Harris received 66% of the vote while Trump won the state by four percentage points.\n\nMore: What Trump's federal crackdown looks like in 5 US cities\n\nThe deployments of federal officers and National Guard troops have been challenged in court and have drawn scrutiny over agents' use of force and what's been seen as increasingly aggressive tactics.\n\nThe anticipated operation in Charlotte also comes amid reports of agents leaving Chicago, which has become a flashpoint in President Donald Trump's mass deportation campaign.\n\nCharlotte Mayor Vi Lyles, a Democrat, said local officials don't know what immigration officials are planning and asked residents to remain calm. She also assured residents that the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department \"is not involved in federal immigration activities.\"\n\n\"I understand this news will create uncertainty and anxiety for many people in our community,\" Lyles said on X. \"Everyone in our community deserves to feel secure and I am committed to doing all that I can to inform our community, help make sure everyone feels safe, and understands their rights.\"\n\nLeaders react to potential Charlotte immigration operation\n\nCongresswoman Alma Adams, a Democrat who represents Mecklenburg County, said she is \"extremely concerned\" about Border Patrol agents being deployed to Charlotte.\n\n\"Charlotte’s immigrant community is a proud part of the Queen City, and I will not stand by and watch my constituents be intimidated or harassed,” she said in a statement. Adams criticized how federal agents handled enforcement in Chicago and Los Angeles and said \"those tactics and values have no place in the City of Charlotte or Mecklenburg County.”\n\nA group of local and state lawmakers held a news conference on Friday, Nov. 14, to oppose the anticipated operation in Charlotte.\n\nState Rep. Jordan Lopez, a Democrat born in Charlotte, said he has spoken to residents across the city since rumors about a federal intervention began. In those conversations, the common denominator has been \"fear and concern,\" he said.\n\n\"We've seen what has taken place in other cities across the country when the federal government gets involved. We have seen the undisciplined agents pointing weapons at unarmed civilians,\" he said. \"We do not want that here.\"\n\nNot all lawmakers oppose the potential operation. Congressman Tim Moore, a Republican who represents a district outside Charlotte, said he has \"full confidence in our federal law enforcement partners and appreciates their ongoing work to uphold the rule of law and protect the people of North Carolina.\"","url":"https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/11/14/charlotte-immigration-enforcement-operations/87269139007/","image":"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/17/USAT/86745755007-20251016-t-174224-z-535581252-rc-2-d-4-haduh-0-z-rtrmadp-3-usashutdownlawenforcement.JPG?auto=webp&crop=2975,1675,x0,y154&format=pjpg&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-14 16:00:56","author":"Usa Today","authors":["Usa Today"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.089},{"id":379025672,"title":"George Clooney &#8216;Stumbled Badly&#8217; With Barack Obama and More By Speaking Out Against Kamala Harris","text":"George Clooney is blowing up his fragile relationship with former President Barack Obama — while sources say he’s quietly planning his own Oval Office campaign.\n\nAccording to insiders, the bromance between the two high-profile Dems crumbled after Clooney called for an enfeebled President Joe Biden to step down in a stinging New York Times piece.\n\nObama quickly endorsed Biden’s veep Kamala Harris for president, but as for handing her the nomination without a quickie primary, “I think it was a mistake, quite honestly,” Clooney said in a recent interview with CBS’ Sunday Mornings.\n\nThat came after Hunter Biden attacked Clooney in an expletive-filled rant during an interview on Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan, suggesting “Obama people” gave him “the blessing” to diss his dad in the Times piece.\n\nClooney tiptoed around talk that he was Obama’s puppet in the TV interview, insisting he alone decided to call for Biden to step aside after he clearly saw the doddering politico needed to go.\n\nBut, according to insiders, the back-and-forth about the issue has created a definite chill between the silver-tongued Ocean’s Eleven star and Obama.\n\nMeanwhile, political insiders claim Clooney felt like a “fall guy” after being blasted for pushing Biden out, only to see Kamala’s campaign go down in flames.\n\nAs the National Enquirer has reported, Clooney was also ripped by Democratic donors who emptied their wallets to back a bad candidate.\n\n“George stumbled badly with Obama, Biden, Kamala and the rest of them and he wants people to know how he truly feels about it,” says one Beltway insider.\n\nFor now, he’s working overtime behind the scenes in Hollywood to recoup his reputation and build support for his own ambitions — especially after Harris announced she’s “not done” and is weighing another White House run.\n\n“George is pained over the mistakes he made. He wants to emerge as the alternative candidate for the liberal crowd even if Kamala makes a comeback with Obama’s support,” says an insider.\n\nAlthough informed politicos say Clooney does not want a permanent split with Obama — who he considers a mentor — he’s ready to take his chances as a Democratic outlier with his own cabal of Hollywood power brokers.\n\n“George still respects Obama and would want to have his backing but his mind is made up,” insists a source. “He will run with or without his support.”","url":"https://nationalenquirer.com/george-clooney-stumbled-badly-with-barack-obama-and-more-by-speaking-out-against-kamala-harris/","image":"https://nationalenquirer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Featured-One-1-george-clooney-barack-obama-kamala-harris.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-14 15:52:09","author":"Mike Hammer","authors":["Mike Hammer"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.124},{"id":379035676,"title":"EXCLUSIVE: Ex Prez Joe Biden Cruelly Mocked as Being 'Trapped in an Exoskeleton' — Inside the Social Media Campaign Trolling the 82-year-old Cancer-Ridden Former Commander in Chief","text":"Joe Biden's troubling recent appearance at a fancy Italian restaurant has critics and conspiracy theorists insisting the former president is being kept alive by a sci-fi exoskeleton, RadarOnline.com can reveal. \n\nAnd one of those who apparently believes the Robo-Biden rumor is President Trump.'That's a Robot'Video circulating on social media shows Biden stumbling his way into an Arlington, Va. restaurant.

It had set a Friday deadline for the BBC to respond.\n\nWhile the BBC statement doesn’t respond to Trump’s demand that he be compensated for “overwhelming financial and reputational harm,” the headline on its news story about the apology said it refused to pay compensation.\n\nThe dispute was sparked by an edition of the BBC’s flagship current affairs series Panorama, titled Trump: A Second Chance? broadcast days before the 2024 U.S. presidential election.\n\nThe third-party production company that made the film spliced together three quotes from two sections of the 2021 speech into what appeared to be one quote in which Trump urged supporters to march with him and “fight like hell.”\n\nAmong the parts cut out was a section where Trump said he wanted supporters to demonstrate peacefully.\n\nDirector-General Tim Davie, along with news chief Deborah Turness, quit Sunday, saying the scandal was damaging the BBC and “as the CEO of BBC News and Current Affairs, the buck stops with me.”\n\nThe letter from Trump’s lawyer demanded an apology to the president and a “full and fair” retraction of the documentary along with other “false, defamatory, disparaging, misleading or inflammatory statements” about Trump.\n\nLegal experts have said that Trump would face challenges taking the case to court in the U.K. or the U.S. They said that the BBC could show that Trump wasn’t harmed because he was ultimately elected president in 2024.\n\nDeadlines to bring the case in English courts, where defamation damages rarely exceed 100,000 pounds ($132,000) expired more than a year ago. Because the documentary was not shown in the U.S., it would be hard to show that Americans thought less of him because of a program they could not watch.\n\nWhile many legal experts have dismissed the president’s claims against the media as having little merit, he has won some lucrative settlements against U.S. media companies and he could try to leverage the BBC mistake for a payout, potentially to a charity of his choice.\n\nIn July, Paramount, which owns CBS, agreed to pay $16 million to settle a lawsuit filed by Trump over a 60 Minutes interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump alleged that the interview was edited to enhance how Harris, the Democratic nominee for president in 2024, sounded.\n\nThat settlement came as the Trump-appointed head of the Federal Communications Commission launched an investigation that threatened to complicate Paramount’s need for administration approval to merge with Skydance Media.\n\nLast year, ABC News said it would pay $15 million to settle a defamation lawsuit over anchor George Stephanopoulos’ inaccurate on-air assertion that the president-elect had been found civilly liable for raping writer E. Jean Carroll. A jury found that he was liable for sexually abusing her.\n\nThe apology and retraction came as BBC said it was looking into a report in the Daily Telegraph that its Newsnight program in 2022 had similarly spliced together parts of the same speech by Trump.","summary":"The BBC said it sent a personal letter to the White House apologizing for the edit of the Trump speech given before some of his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol.","url":"https://globalnews.ca/news/11526138/donald-trump-bbc-documentary-apology-defamation-lawsuit-1-billion/","image":"https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/361dbe20736d47be8094a9353e1ec72cfc2d3c312272a12fe2cb0a4adc0e888d_d6d1be.jpg?quality=65&#038;strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-14 14:22:51","author":"Globalnews Digital,The Associated Press","authors":["Globalnews Digital","The Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.603},{"id":378995936,"title":"In the BBC, Trump Faces an Opponent Beyond the White House’s Grasp | Analysis","text":"Donald Trump this week took his pressure campaign against the press global, threatening to sue the BBC for $1 billion if it doesn’t fully retract a 2024 episode of the “Panorama” documentary series, apologize and “appropriately compensate” him for alleged “reputational and financial harm” in editing his Jan. 6 speech. But has he overreached in flexing his legal muscles abroad?\n\nIn targeting the BBC, Trump appears emboldened after getting Paramount and Disney to settle for $16 million and $15 million, respectively, over cases involving CBS News and ABC News coverage. Since December, major media companies have set a troubling precedent in settling cases they would have been expected to fight on First Amendment grounds.\n\nThe BBC, which doesn’t face similar regulatory concerns as U.S.-based networks, may not fold as easily. On Thursday, the network announced that BBC chair Samir Shah “sent a personal letter to the White House making clear to President Trump that he and the Corporation are sorry for the edit.” \n\nBut critically, the network stated, “While the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim.” \n\nThat’s significant because, while the BBC apologized personally to Trump, it’s rejection of the defamation claim, and its refusal to “compensate” the president, does not meet his stated demands. \n\nA spokesperson for Trump’s legal team did not immediately respond to request for comment. \n\nTrump’s blow-up with the BBC will test whether he can compel an international news organization to pay up, and potentially, the strength of the Special Relationship between two longtime allies.\n\nOn Wednesday, Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who has forged a solid relationship with Trump, refused to say if he would urge the president to drop his legal threat against the BBC, a publicly funded organization that’s also an institution in British life. Starmer said he believes “in a strong and independent BBC” and, unlike some critics, wants it to “exist.” Still, he noted that “where mistakes are made, they do need to get their house in order.”\n\nThere’s little question that the “Panorama” documentary edit of Trump’s Jan. 6, 2021, speech was misleading, as it compressed together remarks that occurred roughly 54 minutes apart: Trump telling his supporters that he was going to “walk down to the Capitol” and his suggesting they “fight like hell, and if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore.”\n\nBut error alone likely won’t be enough to prove defamation. \n\nGeorge Freeman, a former Assistant General Counsel of the New York Times Company, and Executive Director of the Media Law Resource Center, told TheWrap that the first question in a case like this is whether there was “gross distortion.” But beyond that, if Trump sues, he’ll also be expected to demonstrate that the BBC intended to mislead. Freeman referenced the landmark 1964 case of New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, in which public figures must show journalists acted with actual malice or reckless disregard for the truth.\n\n“It’s a tough burden,” said Freeman. \n\nAnother legal obstacle is related to jurisdiction, as Trump has signaled he’ll file suit in Florida, where there is a two-year statute of limitations for defamation cases; it’s only one year in a number of U.S. states, as well as in the U.K. Trump will also be expected to show how the BBC program, which aired in the U.K. in October 2024, damaged him personally and financially.\n\nTrump attorney Alejandro Brito, in his letter to the BBC, said that “the fabricated statements that were aired by the BBC have been widely disseminated throughout various digital mediums, which have reached tens of millions of people worldwide,” and “consequently, the BBC has caused President Trump to suffer overwhelming financial and reputational harm.”\n\nProving harm could be tough given that Trump was elected president in the U.S. shortly after the documentary aired in the U.K., and Forbes estimated in September that the president’s worth is $7.3 billion, having added around $3 billion to his tally since the previous year. Indeed, Trump is wealthier and more powerful than ever.\n\nStill, the president has indicated he’ll follow through with a suit. Trump said in a Tuesday Fox News interview that he has an “obligation” to sue because the BBC “defrauded the public, and they’ve admitted it.”\n\nThe BBC is already in turmoil over the editorial blunder, with director general Tim Davie and head of news Deborah Turness resigning on Sunday and the broadcaster’s board under fire. Some observers framed the executives’ exit as a “coup” and suggested the BBC’s board, which includes conservative appointees, failed to quickly address a controversy that erupted after the Telegraph reported on a leaked memo highlighting the misleading edit, among other issues. Shah apologized Monday for an “error in judgement” in editing the clip.\n\nIn Thursday’s statement, the BBC stated it “has no plans to rebroadcast the documentary ‘Trump: A Second Chance?’ on any BBC platforms.”\n\nOn Fox News, Trump said the BBC edit made his speech “sound radical” when it was actually “very calming.”\n\nFor Trump, it could be hard to establish in court how a sloppily edited clip in a 2024 British documentary would materially shape how the public perceived his actions on Jan. 6, 2021, as he railed against the “rigged” 2020 election and rallied supporters ahead of Congress’ certification of the results.\n\nTrump’s actions on the day of the Capitol riots, and his broader efforts to overturn his 2020 loss, have already been the subject of an impeachment, a federal indictment and an 18-month bipartisan House investigation — not to mention reams of media coverage in the years leading up the documentary airing. The events of the post-2020 election period still loom over American politics, as just this week, Trump pardoned attorney Rudy Giuliani and other allies. \n\nAs for Trump’s specific threat of a $1 billion suit against the BBC, Freeman said the number is “meaningless” since “in American litigation, you can put whatever number you want at the end of a complaint, certainly in a lawyer’s letter, and it doesn’t really mean anything other than getting attention.” Freeman recalled that when he was at the Times, the paper had a policy of not printing the number because “it’s really there just for PR purposes” and “maybe to scare the other side.” (The Times, incidentally, did put the $1 billion figure in its headline.) \n\nIt wasn’t long ago that Trump’s lawsuits against the media might be brushed off. In March 2024, Paul Farhi reported in the Atlantic how Trump “won’t stop suing the media and losing.” But seven months later, Trump won a second term as president and it was the media that was suddenly losing.\n\nABC News defended George Stephanopoulos in court for months after Trump sued the anchor for defamation in March 2024, a claim stemming from Stephanopoulos’ framing of Trump having been found liable for sexual abuse in a civil suit. ABC’s parent company, Disney, settled with Trump in December 2024, weeks after his election victory. \n\nAnd CBS News initially dismissed Trump’s October 2024 suit against “60 minutes” regarding the editing of a Kamala Harris interview, saying it was “completely without merit.” Parent company Paramount settled with Trump in July 2025 as it sought government approval for its merger with Skydance. \n\nDavie, the BBC’s outgoing director, told staff on Tuesday that “we’ve got to fight for our journalism,” and that “this narrative will not just be given by our enemies, it’s our narrative.” \n\nIn rejecting claims of defamation, BBC looks prepared to fight.","summary":"Unlike Disney and Paramount, the British broadcaster doesn’t contend with government regulatory pressures, and this latest media clash will test the president’s ability to cow news organizations overseas\n\n\nThe post In the BBC, Trump Faces an Opponent Beyond the White House’s Grasp | Analysis appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/donald-trump-bbc-legal-analysis/","image":"https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/donald-trump-us-open.jpg?fit=1200%2C675&quality=89&ssl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-14 14:15:00","author":"Michael Calderone","authors":["Michael Calderone"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.272},{"id":379140222,"title":"Quit “sane-washing” Donald Trump","text":"Donald Trump lost it again Wednesday. Perhaps he never had it. He certainly can’t find it. But MAGA supporters shouldn’t worry. Trump losing his mind may be his best defense yet for the gathering political storm that is Hurricane Jeff. \n\nBy Wednesday night, after congressional Democrats released some of Jeffrey Epstein’s emails, the world knew the president had “spent hours” with an Epstein victim at the convicted sex offender’s home. Presidential Pep Secretary Karoline Leavitt publicly identified the victim as the late Virginia Giuffre and accused Democrats of a politically motivated smear campaign. Giuffre, who died by suicide earlier this year at her home in Australia, was allegedly recruited by Epstein’s accomplice and convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell while employed as a spa attendant at the Mar-a-Lago Club in 2000.\n\nIn July, Trump said Epstein “stole people that worked for me,” and a day later he said Giuffre was one of the employees the financier “stole.” Maybe he did know the real Epstein. \n\nOf course Epstein knew the real Trump too. In a 2017 email, Epstein said he knew some “very bad people…none as bad as Trump,” who didn’t have “one decent cell in his body.” Epstein called him “borderline insane.”\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump responded on Truth Social that Democrats were bringing up the “Jeffrey Epstein Hoax” again because — wait for it — they caved on the government shutdown. According to the president, it had nothing to do with his relationship to an alleged sex trafficker or any underage female victims. It was just another precision political hit conducted by the evil Democrats. \n\n“He promised to release the files. Now he’s upset someone is starting to leak the information,” a source close to Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., explained to me. Others said it’s what you’d expect from a man “no longer able to read the room.” Another indicated the president is mentally unaware of his surroundings.\n\nIt’s funny watching people come to the conclusion that Trump appears diminished. At the end of his first administration, I noticed him slipping and I thought I was late to the game. In July 2020 I wrote, “Evidence points to major concerns about Trump’s cognitive abilities, in addition to ongoing concerns about his ability to tell the truth, leading to the inevitable question: How screwed is this country if Trump is reelected?”\n\nAlong with others, I noticed his unsteady gait. The president’s hands were shaking at times. He often seemed listless, tired. Sometimes he babbled like a cicada. Now, five years later, it’s so bad even Trump’s fans are grasping the obvious: Trump II is not Trump I. \n\nPep Secretary Leavitt addressed that fact Wednesday during her weekly appearance in the Brady Briefing Room. With the precision of a trained seal, she accused Democrats of victimizing the president before pivoting to praise Trump when asked about his recent trip to Washington’s Walter Reed Hospital for an MRI. Never fear, she said. The doctors, “all agreed that President Trump remains in exceptional physical health, which you will all see with your own eyes.” \n\nShe never mentioned a word about his mental health. She literally turned and left us hanging.\n\nWe have seen the president’s physical and mental decline with our own eyes, and it seems to be going from bad to worse at an increasing pace. Trump’s speeches often don’t make sense. He seems to nod off in public meetings, and afterward, his staff denies it happened. At a recent Oval Office event, he appeared to fall asleep intermittently for almost 20 minutes until a guest passed out and hit the floor. Sometimes it’s noon before we see the Marine Guard outside the Oval Office indicating he’s at work. In his remarks, he hangs on the word “uh” far too long and often. The American public deserves to know the state of the president’s health before we see Jake Tapper pushing his new book, “I Knew It Before Anyone Else!” — a tome outlining how everybody but Tapper missed the warning signs. \n\nEverything Trump does is seemingly the result of an extremely unhealthy combination of greed, fear and mental aging. Earlier this week, if you waded through the denture and chewing tobacco ads on Truth Social, you would have found this little gem from Trump about the “Miracle Mile” Shopping Center in Chicago — a place that doesn’t even exist. (He most likely meant the Magnificent Mile, and it’s a shopping district.) He claimed it “now has a more than 28% vacancy factor, and is ready to call it quits unless something is done about the murder and crime, which is prevalent throughout the City. CALL IN THE TROOPS, FAST, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE! ‘Just the News.’”\n\nYes, call in the military to attack a fictional shopping center. That sounds sane.\n\nWhat kind of convincing do you need? How about the funniest example. Last Sunday on Truth Social, Trump posted an image with one word — “Wow!” — as a comment to a post that former President Barack Obama had been collecting millions in taxpayer dollars from “royalties linked to Obamacare.” The funny part? It was a satirical post attributed to the “Dunning-Kruger Times.” That’s a reference to the Dunning-Kruger effect — you know, the tendency of those willfully or unalterably ignorant to vastly overestimate their abilities and/or intelligence. \n\nIf the president isn’t napping in the Oval Office during a public meeting — or if his guests aren’t passing out while he stands awkwardly nearby — then Trump is increasingly incoherent when he actually speaks. I’m tired of trying to guess what he is saying, and I know a few others in the White House press pool who feel the same way. \n\nTry to make sense of this gibberish from a recent appearance at the American Business Forum on Nov. 7. “For generations,” he said, “Miami has been a haven for those fleeing communist tyranny in South Africa.” Later he corrected himself to say South America, which isn’t a country but a continent. South Africa has never been a communist country — but there was apartheid and Elon Musk.\n\nThen Trump insulted New York, but said the city was good when he came to Washington — and then someone got their hair done “very expensively” and is now teaching at Harvard. \n\nThere was also this tangent during his speech to military leaders at Quantico on Sept. 30: “. . . That you couldn’t get people to join the armed forces, and by the way, the police also, fire department, and I always put the fire department because they’re great. They’re great. And I got 95% of their vote…and they’re great in our inner cities. It’s a big part of war now. It’s a big part of war. And the fire department goes up in ladders and, you know, people shooting at them…they’re up on these ladders. It goes way up to the sky.”\n\nIt’s all stream of consciousness. Whatever thought pops into Trump’s mind, he says it. I guess he believes people are shooting at firefighters while they’re “rescuing people” on ladders. Juliet Jeske is a political commentator and creator of the newsletter and podcast “Decoding Fox News.” In one popular segment on her show, she reads transcripts of Trump speeches backed by music. She said it was hard to figure out what the president was saying. After scouring records, Jeske found that shooting firefighters almost never happens: “The last time that happened was like 20 years ago, and it was like 25 years before that when the previous one happened.” Puff Donny Trump made it sound like there was a current epidemic. \n\nOn Sept. 5 in the Oval Office, he went off the rails talking about grass, saying he’s planning to “re-grass all the parks” and that grass lives a life “you won’t even recognize because in a year that graffiti will be gone.” He said he knew a lot about grass and potholes will be gone and marble will be polished. And he’s going to do some “drawing circles and everything will be spit shined.”\n\nMore recently, in a Sunday interview on Fox News, the president observed that no one knows what magnets are.\n\nAs for his beloved tariffs, he defended them by claiming on the network that if he wasn’t implementing them, the entire world would be in a depression. \n\nThose close to Trump admit he doesn’t read much and relies on people to tell him what to think — “And no one wants to give him bad news,” a source said. That’s no secret. It’s also well known that Trump needs writers and treats his presidency like it’s an episode of “The Apprentice.” Either way, facts and his increasingly taxed mind never meet. “I have seen him decline very quickly recently,” Jeske noted. \n\nOthers are seeing it too. “The Epstein issue maddens him,” one of his advisers told me. Perhaps that’s why one of his closest acolytes, Steve Bannon, recently told a group of Republicans that if the party didn’t win the 2026 midterms, a lot of people, including himself, were going to prison. He’s afraid Trump will crash and burn, and someone will be left holding the bag.\n\nIn a recent Substack post, former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich trolled Trump’s comments about “affordability” after the Nov. 4 elections. The president, Reich wrote, “called it ‘a new word’ and said Republicans had not talked about it, then blasted it as a Democratic ‘con job’ and declared ‘I don’t want to hear about the affordability.’” The former secretary also pointed out that when Trump was recently asked about his mental acuity, “he confused a dementia screening test for an IQ test.”\n\nTrump also claimed he had “solved” an imaginary conflict between Cambodia and Armenia — two nations that have never been at war and are 4,000 miles apart. Days before, he bragged about stopping a showdown between Azerbaijan and Albania, apparently meaning Armenia.\n\nThen there were his eye-rolling comments to reporters the day after the president met with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., about the shutdown — when he forgot Jeffries’ name. “Chuck Schumer, who was here yesterday, along with…uh, the, a very nice gentleman who I didn’t really know. You know who I’m talking about,” he said.\n\nThe problem is that often nobody knows who or what Trump is talking about — and it’s becoming increasingly apparent that he might not either. The question isn’t if he’s fading, but how fast and how much more dangerous he will become. \n\nFor the reporters covering this president, it has, in a word, been impossible to pull a cogent quote from him. “I have to pull partial quotes and try to make sense of the rest,” one reporter told me.\n\nWe should quit trying and instead give it to the American public raw. Let them see what Trump really sounds like. The White House should just send us transcripts of what he actually said and let us pass it along to everyone else. Or maybe we should just let Jeske read them on national television. She sounds pleasant enough and the music’s entertaining.\n\nJeske explained that while she was trying to understand what Trump actually said during his interview with “60 Minutes” versus what was seen on television, she realized that the broadcast story bore little semblance to the actual event. “They sane-washed it,” she said. “They cut out single words. They moved whole sections around. And this is the president who sued because of the edits made to the Kamala Harris interview.” \n\n“Sane-washing” Trump will ultimately fail. It is a stupid, futile gesture that only lends credence to the idea that the media is protecting him. At the same time, his desperation in trying to control the release of the Epstein information gives even Trump’s staunchest allies the idea that he’s pulling a Richard Nixon-style cover up. \n\nThis heat continues to grow while his ability to handle it is dramatically decreasing. His Friday schedule includes no work. He’s leaving town — apparently unable to handle the political oven of Washington D.C.\n\nAs Harry Truman famously said, “If you can’t stand the heat, get out of the kitchen.” Donald Trump, though, never could stand the heat, and he always wanted to burn down the kitchen. Now? He just doesn’t know why.\n\nAs questions continue to be raised about his association with Epstein, I would recommend Trump embrace his craziness. It may be his best defense.","summary":"Trump's speeches and apparent naps are reaching a critical point","url":"https://www.salon.com/2025/11/14/quit-sane-washing-donald-trump/","image":"https://www.salon.com/app/uploads/2025/11/president-trump-health-150x150.gif","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-14 14:05:58","author":"Brian Karem","authors":["Brian Karem"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.379},{"id":379002592,"title":"Obama and Biden's relationship has deteriorated, 'really bad' since election: ABC reporter","text":"ABC News reporter Jonathan Karl said in a new interview that a recent incident is a perfect sign that former Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden are on the outs.

Karl went on to recall Hunter Biden was enraged at seeing Obama take his father by the arm and lead him offstage at a fundraiser last summer, making then-President Biden appear feeble. At the time, Biden was still the presumptive 2024 Democratic nominee, and his allies were largely publicly dismissing concerns about his viability. \"It's not a good relationship. If they had wanted to see each other, they absolutely would have,\" Karl said of the night he witnessed at the restaurant. The incident was covered in Politico last month.

Sherrill defeated Republican Jack Ciattarelli during his third run for the governor's mansion to succeed term-limited New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy (D). She beat Ciattarelli by 14 points last week. Sherrill’s win in the governor's race will prompt a special election for her seat in New Jersey’s 11th Congressional District.

Congress is poised to vote on the release of files unviewed by the public, but Trump has continued to push back at what he now calls a “hoax.”\n\nBurnett brought up Epstein’s correspondence in which he wrote about a Norwegian businesswoman and heiress: “my 20 year old girlfriend in 1993, , that after two years i gave to donald.”\n\n“It screams about, you know, the mindset of these men,” Williams said. “You know, the same two men who did what they did to me when Jeffrey Epstein walked me into Donald Trump’s office to be groped by him. Clearly, we are these objects, these trophies, and it’s deeply misogynistic. It’s horrifying.”\n\nBurnett also mentioned Williams’ previous account claiming Trump molested her as Epstein watched at Trump Tower, and how their smiling at each other revealed the pair’s “weird and twisted game.”\n\nWilliams added, “I clearly was delivered there for the groping.” She said that she had a reputation for standing up to inappropriate men, so “when I froze and didn’t respond, you know, I think Jeffrey got very upset about it. He expected a fight.”\n\nTrump was the only male friend Epstein consistently talked about, according to Williams. “It’s just so maddening to me that Donald Trump ran on, you know, cleaning up the swamp,” she continued, “and all this time and energy is being spent on covering up information about the biggest swamp monster who’s ever existed.”\n\nIn October 2024, Williams gave a graphic recounting of the alleged incident.\n\n“He pulled me in to him and started groping me,” Williams said. “He put his hands all over my breasts, my waist, my butt, and I froze. And I froze because I was so deeply confused about what was happening, because the hands were moving all over me, yet these two men were like, smiling at one another and continuing on in their conversation.”\n\nThen-campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt called the accusations “false,” the Guardian reported, and she claimed the story was fabricated by Kamala Harris’ campaign.","url":"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/stacey-williams-jeffrey-epstein-donald-trump-groped_n_6916fd4de4b0191be9d4ab31?origin=home-zone-b-unit","image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/6917198117000003dc9c5940.jpeg?cache=qytO3MsVu5&ops=1778_1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-14 13:01:28","author":"Ron Dicker","authors":["Ron Dicker"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.597},{"id":378983162,"title":"BBC apologizes to Trump but rejects his demands for compensation","text":"CBS agreed to pay $16 million to settle a suit by the president accusing the network of election interference over how the network’s news show 60 Minutes edited a quote from an interview with presidential candidate Kamala Harris, which he claimed made her sound more coherent.

The resignations followed exposure of the splicing together of two parts of a speech by President Donald Trump on Jan. 6, 2021. The edits made it look and sound like the president was urging his followers to violently attack the Capitol.\n\nOne emailer said the first “B” in BBC should stand for bias. That reminded me of what some conservatives called CNN during the Clinton administration (the Clinton News Network), because of their perceived bias.\n\nThe second writer said the edit was only a “mistake.” It wasn’t a mistake. It was deliberate and it was made with the intention of having viewers accept their desired negative opinion of Trump. In another country and in another era, this would be called propaganda. If this sounds like the editing of the CBS “60 Minutes” interview with Kamala Harris to make her sound articulate, it should. Both flowed from the same liberal worldview.\n\nKudos to the London Daily Telegraph for practicing real journalism and exposing the edit of the Trump speech.\n\nDuring World War II the BBC was a trusted source of information. It sent coded information to the French resistance and took other actions in support of the war effort. This was accurately depicted in the film “The Longest Day.” In recent years, the BBC has seen its level of trust decline.\n\nA survey conducted by David Pickering of The Conversation, a news organization that calls itself “dedicated to facts and evidence,” noted that “Trust in the BBC is heavily conditioned by political identity.” The survey of 11,170 people in the UK “showed striking differences between how people with left-wing and right-wing party affiliations felt about the broadcaster.”\n\nThe editing incident isn’t the first time the credibility of the BBC has been called into question. Several internal studies have found the organization to have reported unfairly on the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. The studies changed nothing as the pro-Palestinian bias has continued. It is the same when it comes to their reporting on “climate change.”\n\nA Wall Street Journal editorial notes the BBC has had an LGBTQ desk within its London headquarters to make sure stories were favorable about transgender issues. Stories that did not reflect the BBC’s “liberal orthodoxy” were suppressed, notes the Journal.\n\nOn top of this, streamers and owners of television sets are required to pay an annual TV license fee of £174.50 (about $230) per year for a color license and £58.50 ($77) for a black-and-white license, a compulsory payment used primarily to fund the BBC’s television, radio and online services.\n\nDoes anyone still own a black-and-white TV? And on top of this, viewers must watch endless commercials, some of which are more entertaining and creative than the programs.\n\nEfforts by some conservative members of Parliament to eliminate the TV license fee have failed. As in America, politicians are reluctant to give up money.\n\nTim Davie, the now-resigned director general of the BBC said in a statement: “This narrative will not just be given by our enemies. It’s our narrative. We own things.”\n\nRight there you have the reason so much of the media in the UK and the U.S. are held in low regard. They think they “own things,” instead of exercising a responsibility to serve the people fairly and accurately. As with other exposures of bias, I suspect little will change within the BBC unless it follows the example of the new president of CBS News and begins hiring reporters with a conservative worldview who will presumably report conservative ideas fairly and accurately.\n\n©2025 Tribune Content Agency, LLC.","url":"https://patriotpost.us/opinion/122726-the-biased-broadcasting-corporation-2025-11-14","image":"https://img.patriotpost.us/01GR4QNK1K7PV7B16TYRNJ89RV.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-14 12:29:07","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.031},{"id":378982608,"title":"Keep pushback against Trump going into 2026 elections","text":"Democrats and other democracy well-wishers are spilling gallons of ink and a profusion of pixels on the question of whether ending the government shutdown was a blunder or not. \n\nI submit that either way, it won’t matter very much if at all in 12 months — and the 2026 elections are where our attention needs to pivot right now.\n\nAfter the most depressing year in American politics of my lifetime, the 2025 election results were like a defibrillator shock to a moribund body. The landslide percentages achieved by Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill; the record-smashing turnout in New York City; the huge Democratic gains in the Virginia House of Delegates; the sweep of three state supreme court seats in Pennsylvania; the lopsided results in obscure Georgia races, like for the public service commission; and the success of the California redistricting plan (a response to Texas’ naked gerrymander) all point to the fact that the electorate — unlike CEOs, partners in major law firms, university presidents and media companies — is not surrendering to President Donald Trump. \n\nComing on the heels of the massive “No Kings” demonstrations across the nation, last week’s elections are reminders that voters are the final bulwark against despotism.\n\nOf course, these races should not be overinterpreted. Democrats tend to turn out in greater numbers for off-year contests than Republicans; the GOP’s Virginia gubernatorial candidate was off-putting; and Democrats ran disciplined campaigns. But the biggest drag on Republicans was something that felled Kamala Harris and is unlikely to change markedly by this time next year: prices remain high. Millions of non-MAGA voters supported Trump because they believed his promise to restore the 2019 economy. That he cannot do, and wouldn’t be able to accomplish even if he refrained from the boneheaded tariffs that are his delight.\n\nOver the course of the past year, the question I’ve had the most difficulty responding to was also the one that was most often asked: What can I, as a citizen, do to counter this descent into authoritarianism? The “No Kings” rallies were one answer. The 2025 elections were another. And now, the next step is coming into focus.\n\nThe Trump team will also certainly attempt to rig the midterm elections while falsely claiming the elections are rigged against Trump. They have already begun. The mid-decade gerrymanders that the president has demanded of red states are a brazen effort to skew election results. It’s Trump’s style to do the corrupt things openly, so that they almost seem above board.\n\nA president who pulled every lever, jiggled every handle and applied every kind of pressure he could think of, up to and including inciting a riot to prevent his successor from taking office deserves no benefit of the doubt about what he might attempt in 2026. Let’s not forget that Trump entertained the possibility of using the military to confiscate ballot boxes in close states.\n\nStill perseverating about the “stolen” 2020 election, Trump is already posting on Truth Social that he detects similar fraud in 2026: “No mail-in or ‘Early’ Voting, Yes to Voter ID!” he wrote. “Watch how totally dishonest the California Prop Vote is! Millions of Ballots being ‘shipped.’ GET SMART REPUBLICANS, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE!!!”\n\nThe Justice Department sent “monitors” to polling sites in California and New Jersey, which may have been nothing, or it may have been a dry run for deploying large numbers of federal officials to intimidate voters. Since 2020, Trump has been able to install election deniers in key federal posts, most importantly as attorney general, and has created a new, MAGA-inflected paramilitary force in the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. It is no stretch to imagine ICE agents snatching people from voting queues and thereby deterring U.S. citizens who speak with an accent or have dark skin from exercising their right to vote. God knows, they’ve already pulled any number of citizens into their unmarked vehicles and held them for hours.\n\nEveryone can participate in the pushback. Thankfully, elections are local and state affairs, not federal, which means the Trump administration has limited power to interfere with the way votes are cast. Still, leave nothing to chance. Sign up to be an election worker. The turnover rate has increased since 2020, with 2 in 5 election workers leaving the job. Contact groups concerned with election integrity, like Protect Democracy, the Campaign Legal Center, the Brennan Center for Justice, the NAACP, States United Democracy Center, Checks and Balances (especially if you have a law degree) or the Fair Elections Center.

Greg Bovino and many of his agents favor Trump, GOP in their campaign giving","text":"In a TV interview this summer, amid an aggressive immigration operation in Los Angeles that led to a war of words with Democratic leaders in California, U.S. Border Patrol Cmdr. Greg Bovino described himself as “apolitical” in how he does his job.\n\nBut he’s certainly not apolitical as a private citizen.\n\nBovino, who in recent months led similar raids in the Chicago area that could be winding down, has a history of campaign contributions benefiting Republicans, as federal election records show:\n\nBovino gave President Donald Trump’s campaign $250 in 2020 during his unsuccessful run for president between his two terms.Another person from Bovino’s household gave Trump $104 in 2024.In 2020, Bovino gave $125 to the campaign fund of ex-U.S. Sen. Kelly Loeffler, an Illinois native and Georgia Republican now serving as Trump’s Small Business Administration chief.The same year, Bovino gave another $125 to former U.S. Sen. David Perdue, a Georgia Republican who’s now serving as U.S. ambassador to China.\n\nWith the White House saying the region’s immigration operations are targeting undocumented immigrants who are violent criminals, and critics calling it a political ploy designed to sow chaos in Democrat-led cities, the Chicago Sun-Times examined public records to assess the political leanings of the agency at the heart of the controversy.\n\nThe findings show most rank-and-file agents with the Border Patrol, and its parent agency Customs and Border Protection, don’t give money to politicians, but of those who do, they mirror Bovino in donating disproportionately to the GOP and Trump.\n\nOver the last two election cycles, more than 200 donors identifying as Border Patrol or Border Protection agents gave nearly 800 contributions to federal campaign funds totaling almost $30,000, according to Federal Election Commission data.\n\nMore than 500 of those contributions — or 70%, totaling over $21,000 — went to political funds directly benefiting Trump.\n\nBy contrast, campaign funds benefiting former President Joe Biden and ex-Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee for president who lost to Trump in November, received just a dozen or so contributions from agents totaling around $650.\n\nThe rest of the total went to a smattering of Democratic and GOP candidates, plus campaign funds beyond those parties, including one benefiting Robert F. Kennedy Jr., once an independent and now a Trump aide, and to Libertarians.\n\nNeither the Border Patrol nor White House would comment. Bovino couldn’t be reached.\n\nNo donations listed an Illinois address, though 424 came from Texas and 156 from Arizona, with those two states together sharing more than 1,600 miles of border with Mexico.\n\nWith border agents generally making middle-class wages, most of the contributions were also relatively modest, ranging from less than $1 to $500 a pop, the latter given in 2024 by an agent from San Diego.\n\nOne agent from Brackettville, Texas, made 32 campaign contributions to Republicans since the start of 2023 totaling more than $1,500, all but about $130 going to Trump, records show.\n\nAnother from Dilley, Texas, also made 32 Republican contributions totaling $1,378 with more than $300 of that going to Trump.\n\nOf the $128,000 given over the last decade by border patrol agents and other employees, $100,000 or so went to Republican or conservative political funds, and most of that benefited Trump.\n\nThe Sun-Times’ findings are a snapshot because not everybody identifies their employment the same way when making political contributions, and not all donors make their occupations clear on disclosure paperwork.\n\nAs the Border Patrol continues to fan out across the region under orders from Trump, the FEC records provide a hint of how agents may personally align with the mission, or the underlying politics.\n\nThe National Border Patrol Council, a union representing around 18,000 Border Patrol agents and support staff, issued its first endorsement in a presidential election in 2016, backing Trump as he talked about cracking down on immigrants entering the U.S. illegally and building a border wall. The union repeated that support in 2024.\n\nUnion leader Paul Perez was among the Border Patrol agents to give to Trump last year: Nearly $50 in total in two campaign contributions.\n\n“He’s been the strongest president in the history of the country when it comes to defending our borders and making sure that we protect Americans,” Perez said.\n\nAsked why his agents seem to skew so heavily Republican, he said, “No way to tell, I’ve never looked at that kind of data.”","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/the-watchdogs/2025/11/14/greg-bovino-border-patrol-campaign-contributions-chicago-enforcement-donald-trump","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/08b78c6/2147483647/strip/false/crop/4000x3000+0+0/resize/1486x1115!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F74%2F19%2F9e5d6af9486a823c6a6326da2e16%2F2025","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-14 11:30:00","author":"Robert Herguth,Sophie Sherry","authors":["Robert Herguth","Sophie Sherry"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.26},{"id":378988760,"title":"Trump's Epstein problem is snowballing - and he looks increasingly desperate","text":"WASHINGTON DC – Donald Trump did something very unusual on Wednesday night, possibly even unique in the annals of his second term in office. He resisted the temptation to talk.\n\nAs the US President brought the country’s longest-ever government shutdown (at least, until the next one in February) to an end, he asked reporters whether they had any questions. But when members of the White House press corps peppered him with inquiries about emails that appear to show Trump may have had a deeper level of involvement with, and knowledge of Jeffrey Epstein’s sordid and illegal activities, the US President kept his counsel. Tight-lipped is not his usual operating principle. But when it came to Epstein, at least on Wednesday night, the cat made off with his tongue.\n\nNext week, members of the House of Representatives will vote on whether to require Trump’s government to release all files in the Justice Department’s possession relating to the disgraced and deceased financier. Given that many voters among the Make America Great Again (Maga) faithful are demanding the full transparency that Trump promised on the campaign trail last year, the White House is braced for a substantial number of Republican defections.\n\nMany Maga supporters are proven, dyed-in-the-wool conspiracy theorists. But you don’t need to be one of them to recognise that something very fishy has been going on behind White House walls to stop the files from being released.\n\nIn February, Attorney General Pam Bondi told Americans that documents relating to Epstein (his so-called client list) were “sitting on my desk right now to review”. She cited “a directive by Trump”, indicating that once her review was complete, the files would be publicly released.\n\nBy July, her own Department of Justice stunned Epstein’s victims and their families by suddenly announcing that “no incriminating ‘client list’” existed. The only Epstein materials in the Department’s possession were described as “intertwined” with sensitive information (Bondi indicated that much of it was pornographic in nature), and therefore “no further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted”.\n\nFive days later, as fury convulsed Maga, Trump tried to tough it out. In a posting on social media, he urged his supporters to stop “going after Attorney General Pam Bondi, who is doing a FANTASTIC JOB”. Epstein, he groused, was proving to be “a guy who never dies”. He also claimed, without providing any proof, that the Epstein documents were “written by [Barack] Obama, Crooked Hillary [Clinton]…and the Losers and Criminals of the Biden Administration”.\n\nAs we hurtle towards the end of the year, two things remain clear: first, the Epstein story remains a smouldering depth charge beneath Trump’s presidency, and secondly, that he continues to go to extraordinary lengths to try and prevent the release of any more documents.\n\nThis week, in another twist, he tried to persuade one key Republican to withdraw her signature from a petition that has narrowly secured sufficient backers to force next week’s House vote on releasing all the files. Trump phoned Congresswoman Lauren Boebert, a Maga Republican from Colorado, then personally summoned her to the White House for a meeting that occurred in the highly secure confines of the Situation Room. There, Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel were reported to have discussed her demands. The White House provided no readout of the meeting, but Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said it was an example of Trump’s “transparency” and his willingness “to sit down with members of Congress and address their concerns”.\n\nWith his options to block the House vote narrowing, Trump can retain some confidence that the Senate is less likely to join calls for the files’ release. Trump would also be able to veto any Senate vote that failed to go his way. But their mere backing of the measure by the House will create fresh and unwelcome traction beneath the story.\n\nWhile it is impossible to know whether Trump has specific fears about the contents of the unreleased files, Bondi steadfastly refused to answer questions last month about any mentions of the US President that may be contained within them. Testifying under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee, she stonewalled as multiple Democrats tried to secure information. “Eventually you’re going to have to answer for your conduct,” warned Illinois Senator Dick Durbin. “You won’t do it today, but eventually you will,” he threatened.\n\nIn one email released by House Democrats on Tuesday, Epstein suggests that he had pictures “of Donald and girls in bikinis in my kitchen”. The author Michael Wolff has previously claimed that Epstein showed him pictures of Trump accompanied by topless women or girls of unknown ages at the sex trafficker’s Palm Beach home. Whether those pictures even exist, or are held within the FBI’s files, is unclear.\n\nA Trump team spokesperson accused Wolff of “lying for attention” during the presidential election campaign last year, adding: “Michael Wolff is a disgraced writer who routinely fabricates lies in order to sell fiction books because he clearly has no morals or ethics. He waited until days before the election to make outlandish false smears, all in an effort to engage in blatant election interference on behalf of Kamala Harris.” Trump has said he cut ties with Epstein long before the financier was indicted and that he did not know of Epstein’s abuse.\n\nHowever, with each release of documents, questions only intensify about the US President’s involvement with a man he claims to have thrown out of his Mar-a-Lago resort in perhaps 2004.\n\nThe timing of this week’s release may have queered Ghislaine Maxwell’s plans to ask Trump to commute her 20-year prison sentence. Epstein’s girlfriend is now residing at a lower-security prison in Texas, after she spent two days earlier this year being interviewed by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, who just happens also to be Trump’s former personal lawyer. On Wednesday, Leavitt said Maxwell’s application for a commutation was currently off the table. “It’s not something he’s talking about or even thinking about at this moment in time”, she told reporters.\n\nAt the White House on Thursday, First Lady Melania Trump made a rare appearance alongside her husband, as he signed an executive order that he claimed would improve the foster care system in the United States. White House officials ensured that the East Room was packed with members of his inner circle, along with families supportive of the US President’s proclamation. Thanks to the crowd, he managed to evade fresh questions from the press about Epstein for a second consecutive day.

Subscribe to VDH’s own YouTube channel to watch past episodes.\n\nSami Winc: Well, let’s turn then to the Palisades Fire in California and the destruction it wrought. Lee Zeldin, our [head of the Environmental Protection Agency], has reported that the federal government has finished their debris removal, but residents are still complaining that it is almost impossible to get permits to get the rebuilding going. And he said that it’s [California Gov.] Gavin Newsom and [Los Angeles Mayor] Karen Bass who have not sped up one thing, despite their promises. I was wondering your thoughts.\n\nVictor Davis Hanson: I have mixed feelings about this because, on the one hand, these noble people who tragically lost their homes are being used as pawns because they have a lunatic mayor in Karen Bass, a lunatic City Council in L.A.\n\nAll they’re interested in is fighting ICE. There’s a million illegal aliens in Los Angeles County. How it got to that point, I don’t know. But that’s what the agenda of Newsom and Karen Bass are. They care more about illegal aliens not being deported than they do homeowners.\n\nAnd they have this idea that they’re going to rezone the Palisades and make high-density housing, or at least small little cottages. I don’t know what they are. But they don’t want these people who were affluent to build these majestic Romanesque homes again. I drove through there about two weeks ago, at least along the [Pacific Coast Highway], and there’s nothing happening. It’s just pathetic.\n\nAnd then when I said I’m conflicted, Prop. 50, which is going to destroy the bipartisan committee and gerrymander California from nine congressional Republican representatives to probably four or five, they voted almost 60%. So, a lot of those people in the Palisades voted for this thing.\n\nAnd they keep voting for Newsom and they keep voting for the Karen Basses of the world, and they keep voting for these crazy people in the legislature. Then they get surprised when it boomerangs back on them. \n\nThe voting of the elite along the coast is, “I want to use other people as lab rats. I want to build massive solar plants. I want to decommission nuclear plants. I don’t want natural gas or oil to be tapped in California. I want to overregulate agriculture. I don’t want any charter schools, prep schools. I want the teacher’s unions to run the state and the government unions. I think homelessness is really great. I don’t want to touch the homeless problem. I want to have reparations,” and then, ding. “I live in Bel Air.” Ding. “I live in Atherton.” Ding. “I live in Napa.” Ding. “I hang out on the shores of Lake Tahoe.” What I just described is the mentality of the Bay Area, the people who got us into this mess in this state.\n\nAnd I’m talking about you, Jerry Brown, 16 years as governor, Gavin Newsom, maybe 30 years. San Francisco City Council, San Francisco mayor, San Francisco lieutenant governor, San Francisco governor. You got about 30 years right there. And then you had Barbara Boxer. She was responsible. The late Dianne Feinstein, Nancy Pelosi, Kamala Harris.\n\nWhat do they all have in common? Well, they all wanted to make a progressive, radical state, and they got their wish. We have the highest gas prices, the highest gas taxes, the highest electricity cost, kilowatt. We have 49th, I think, Reason magazine said that our infrastructure and highways were. We’re about 42nd in education.\n\nSan Francisco’s per capita property crime rate was the highest in the country. We’ve got the most illegal aliens. We’ve got the most homeless people. One-third of the United States population on entitlements lives here. Half the births are on Medi-Cal. I could go on forever.\n\nThat’s the state. And those people gave us this state. And where did they live? Barbara Boxer went down to, I think, Rancho Mirage or somewhere near. Kamala Harris lives in [Brentwood]. Jerry Brown retired to his woodsy Grass Valley estate. Gavin Newsom has a $9 million home, right. Nancy Pelosi made about $200 million somehow as an insider knowledgeable person about stock trades.\n\nA speaker, she has a mansion in San Francisco and an Italian-designed estate in Napa. So, what am I getting at? The people who destroyed the state and made people in the San Joaquin Valley or Inland Empire or Foothills have to pay these exorbitant prices never had to suffer the consequences of their own ideology.\n\nThey made out like bandits. And they live in splendor, and people can’t make that connection and they keep voting them in. So, what happens? We’re in a doom … The people that can make the connection, they leave, 300,000 a year, and the people who are left are either the very, very wealthy who are immune from the toxicity of what they plan for others, or they’re the 50% of the state who Medi-Cal pays for all their births or the 40% that pays for their health care. \n\nIt’s a medieval society of a few very wealthy on the cone of the period pyramid and everybody else below.\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who counts among her legacies in Congress successfully undercutting the push for Medicare for All, announced last week that she is retiring from Congress. The two-time former speaker of the House made her announcement after Democrats made remarkable gains in nationwide elections, campaigning on affordability and standing up to the Trump administration.\n\n“We are in this era where we need new ideas, we need new leaders, we need people who are going to push the party in a new direction,” says Saikat Chakrabarti, who is running to replace Pelosi and represent San Francisco in Congress, making economic inequality and corporate power the focal point of his politics. This week on The Intercept Briefing, host Akela Lacy speaks to Chakrabarti, the co-founder of the progressive outfit Justice Democrats who helped run the primary campaign of one of its first candidates, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, becoming her first chief of staff. \n\nAnswering Lacy’s question as to how he’ll get it done, Chakrabarti says, “In the 1930s, we had a really powerful, far right in this country. We were actually seeing Nazi rallies in Madison Square Garden, it was filling the stadium. And the way we defeated that was FDR came in with the New Deal movement. He built this whole new economy and a whole new society that improved people’s lives so dramatically, it just killed this idea that you need an authoritarian to do it for you.” FDR “wasn’t advocating for going back to a pre-Great Depression era. He was advocating for something new. So that’s the way we get it done, and I see some movement towards that.”\n\nChakrabarti has been openly calling for House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., to be primaried and tells The Intercept that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer should be too, following the end of the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, after eight Democratic senators — none who are up for reelection — joined forces with Republicans to pass a spending package.\n\n“My goal, honestly, is to replace a huge part of the Democrat establishment,” says Chakrabarti. “I’m calling for primaries all across the country. … I think we actually have to get in there and be in a position of power where we can do all that, so it’s not going to be this constant compromising with the establishment, trying to figure out how we can push.” He adds, “I tried the pushing strategy — that’s what Justice Democrats was: We were trying to elect people to try to push the Democratic Party to do the right thing. It’s not going to work. We have to replace them.”\n\nListen to the full conversation of The Intercept Briefing on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you listen.\n\nAkela Lacy: Welcome to The Intercept Briefing, I’m Akela Lacy. \n\nIt’s the end of an era. \n\nNancy Pelosi: I will not be seeking reelection to Congress. \n\nAL: U.S. Representative Nancy Pelosi, who counts among her legacies in Congress successfully undercutting the push for Medicare for All, announced last week that she’s retiring from Congress. The Democrat and two-time former speaker of the House represents one of the country’s most liberal districts: San Francisco, California. And she has done so for nearly 40 years.\n\nPelosi made her announcement after Democrats made remarkable gains in nationwide elections. One takeaway, as we discussed in last week’s episode, is that voters want leaders who will fight for affordability and stand up to the Trump administration.\n\nThe race to replace Pelosi began before she publicly shared that she would not run for reelection. And although the California primary is seven months away, it’s already looking like a crowded and competitive field.\n\nSaikat Chakrabarti was the first to jump into the race for Pelosi’s seat, setting up a challenge from her left. \n\nChakrabarti co-founded the progressive outfit Justice Democrats and helped run the first campaign and office of one of its first candidates: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nHe’s running on a campaign promising to push for universal health care and child care, enact a stock trading ban for members of Congress, cost-of-living issues, and to “stop funding the genocide in Gaza.”\n\nHe’s also criticized some of his colleagues in the progressive movement. So how is he positioning himself amid a wave of other primary challengers? And how would he actually fulfill his campaign promises? Saikat Chakrabarti joins me now. Saikat, welcome to the Intercept Briefing.\n\n​​Saikat Chakrabarti: Hey, thanks for having me.\n\nAL: ​​Saikat, you’ve been described as a bit of a contradiction. You’re independently wealthy; you’re a founding engineer at the payment processing company Stripe; and Business Insider has said, you may be wealthier than Nancy Pelosi, one of the wealthiest members of Congress.\n\nYou’ve also made economic inequality and corporate power the focal point of your politics. You ran Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s campaign, became her first chief of staff, and co-founded Justice Democrats.\n\nMost tech millionaires aren’t necessarily also progressive anti-establishment politicians. How do those two identities fit together for you?\n\nSC: I’d say most tech millionaires are really working toward their own demise as well in the long run. Because, I mean, look, I’ll give you my whole background. I grew up middle class in Texas. I grew up going to public schools. My parents actually grew up fairly poor. My parents are from India. They immigrated here in the 1970s, and my dad was a victim of partition, which was a catastrophic event — we basically split up India along religious lines after the Indian Revolution. And so his family were refugees that had to flee overnight from Bangladesh over to India. And so I grew up with the stories of their struggles. My dad grew up with a family of 12 in a one-bedroom apartment, often didn’t know where his next meal would be coming from.\n\nI’d say my values really come from that — in two ways. Like one, it’s both these values that are shaped by how hard people who are totally capable have to actually work when they get a bad plate handed to them in life. But also just the way our economy is set up and has been set for so long is a lottery. Because at the end of the day, my dad struggled, but he won a lottery ticket; he got a visa to come to America. And I go back to Calcutta and I meet his friends and his family who all had it just as hard or just as hard-working, just as capable people who never made it out.\n\nAnd so I joined the tech industry back in 2007, or 2009, actually, after college. And it was a time when tech really was being pitched as a solution to a lot of the big problems in the world. I was a completely apolitical person, and I bought it. I did think I was going in to try to solve some big issues. At the time like Muhammad Yunus was doing microfinance to alleviate poverty, yada, yada. And living in San Francisco and seeing unhoused people on the streets while I’m going to my tech job — it just gave me the feeling that maybe I’m actually not solving the problems I really want to work on.\n\nSo it sounds really cheesy now, but I quit the tech industry and I wrote a list. I was like, I want to work on inequality, poverty, and climate change. Again, I was not political at all — I was looking at mainly working in nonprofits. And that was around the time Bernie Sanders started running for president. I didn’t know if he had all the answers, but he was talking about those things in a very compelling way.\n\nAnd so I joined that, and I ended up working on the Bernie campaign. I started a group — Justice Democrats — to recruit people to run on progressive values all around the country. And that’s how I ended up recruiting AOC to run, and ran her campaign, and ended up as her chief of staff.\n\nBut I really believe at the end of the day, like a fundamental thing — and this is why I don’t think it is a contradiction — I experienced that lottery economy, that the startup economy really is in San Francisco. It’s this system where you can just hit it big if you just happen to be in the right place at the right time.\n\nThat’s what happened to me. And like I worked hard, but I did not work harder than a teacher or a nurse or the people cleaning our offices did every single day. I just won the startup lottery — and that to me is wild to have an economy set like that where you can just win a lottery and never have to work again.\n\nWhile most people actually running society, working hard to run society, we’re saying, “You’re never going to be able to afford a house. You’re never going to be able to have a secure retirement.” I think a society and economy set up like that is doomed to fail. I think that is the ultimate demise of America. \n\nAnd I’d say to people who are in my position, who have wealth, who don’t see it that way, who aren’t willing to just accept some taxes on themselves to make an economy that actually works for everybody — you’re being shortsighted because this won’t end up good for you either, if you end up in a society that’s a complete dystopia, that’s completely unequal.\n\nAL: Speaking of the people on whose backs the society runs, as we’re speaking, the longest government shutdown ever is on the verge of ending after eight Democratic senators decided to join forces with Republicans to pass a spending package.\n\nFor years, you’ve been critical of Democrats, saying they’re too weak, too compromising, too establishment. Do you think they should have ended the shutdown without a healthcare guarantee?\n\nSC: No. I mean, this has been my main critique of the party for so long. A lot of my critique is on the policies and what they actually want to do and what they want to stand for.\n\nBut a big part of my critique is, strategically, they preemptively cave, and this was a prime example of that. I mean, not through any leadership by Schumer or Hakeem Jeffries, but we were actually winning on this fight. And it’s not like, I don’t think this is a political fight. We were actually fighting for once to deliver something real for people who are suffering in this economy right now.\n\nThis economy sucks, and we’re talking about doubling or tripling people’s health insurance premiums in the middle of this, right? So Democrats were winning that messaging. You saw it in the polling, you saw public sentiment on the shutdown going towards Democrats. And then we’re coming off the back of a massive electoral victory last Tuesday where Donald Trump actually went on TV and said, you know, he was saying part of that was because Republicans were losing the messaging on the shutdown fight. So, I mean, call me naive but honestly, I thought like, “OK, finally we have the leverage, we have the upper hand. Maybe Democrats will realize they can push.”\n\nSo watching them cave, I mean, oh my God, why? Like, why? You’re winning. You could have actually delivered something and then you could have gone into the next election and said, “We fought Trump and we won.” Because right now, I think the main reason people don’t want to vote for Democrats — part of it’s the policy, but part of it’s, they’re weak! Do you want to vote for people who aren’t going to get shit done for you? No. So this just proved, I think, that image to a bunch of people.\n\nSo no, they absolutely should have kept fighting. I think they could have won. And honestly, my opinion, if we had seen Hakeem Jeffries and Schumer and some of the Democratic leaders actually fighting way more — because my big critique of this whole fight was, I’m not seeing it be front-page news every single day. I’m not seeing Democrats go out there and persuade the public in the way that I saw Dick Cheney and George Bush persuade the public to go to war in Iraq, which was an actually an unpopular thing to do. If we use that sort of tactic, I think we could have ended the shutdown way earlier because Trump’s numbers on this would’ve been plummeting way faster, and we would’ve actually gotten something done for people. That’s the part that pisses me off.\n\nAL: You’re touching a little bit on sort of this tension between the inside-outside strategy versus pushing for everything that you possibly can for responding to constituents. On this topic, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has faced criticism for what some say has been a moderation in her approach: speaking on the DNC stage, saying Kamala Harris worked “tirelessly for a ceasefire” in Gaza. What’s your response to that and how do you see yourself navigating that inside-outside game if you’re elected?\n\nSC: Look, I think, AOC, she’s kind of alone in there, right? Like there’s only a few, a handful of progressives in Congress right now. And I think they’re all trying to do the best they can with a limited amount of power. And that means trying to push the agenda, trying to push from the inside and working with outside organizations to create pressure. \n\nMy goal, honestly, is to replace a huge part of the Democrat establishment. I’ve been very clear about that from the start. I’m calling for primaries all across the country. I’m trying to recruit people to run across the country, and I’m talking to folks who are stepping up and challenging the establishment right now across the country. I think we actually have to get in there and be in a position of power where we can do all that so it’s not going to be this constant compromising with the establishment, trying to figure out how we can push. \n\nI tried the pushing strategy — that’s what Justice Democrats was: We were trying to elect people to try to push the Democratic Party to do the right thing. It’s not going to work. We have to replace them. We just have to replace them. And that’s, you know, to me that’s where I’m headed. That’s my politics. \n\nI think it’s not just existential for the party; I think it’s existential for the country. Because ultimately, I think people have been voting for anybody who’s standing for bold, sweeping economic change ever since the Great Recession. I’d say that was why Barack Obama got elected. I think that’s why Donald Trump got elected. And it’s for good reason. It’s because the American Dream has been shattered. Children today are not going to do as well as their parents. People’s wages have been stagnant for decades while the cost of essentials are going up.\n\nAnd so what we see is people are really open to the kind of change, but all they know is that the status quo is not cutting it. So Trump has a version of what that change is: MAGA. It’s saying, “You can’t afford a house, you can’t afford a secure retirement because of immigrants, because of our attention to people in foreign countries, because of trans people or scientists,” what have you.\n\nAnd we have to present an actual vision and a plan on the other side, and then deliver on that plan to improve people’s lives. And that’s not going to happen by pushing people to get on the right policies. It’s going to be a whole movement that has to take power and make it happen — put the country on a path to implementing something like that.\n\nAL: In this vein, you have talked openly as you are now about the fact that the first Squad members who came into Congress have only been able to do so much because of a lack of broader organization among progressives. One of the key proposals you’ve been working on for the last few years is what some people are calling the “Green New Deal on steroids” — a successor to the Green New Deal that you led work on as AOC’s chief of staff. What are your plans, and how do you think you can bring them to fruition where other progressive policy priorities have so far failed?\n\nSC: So the thing I’ve been working on at my think tank New Consensus, we’re calling it the “Mission for America.” And it really harkens back to basically what FDR did during the New Deal, but also during the mobilization for World War II to build a whole new economy because I think that’s ultimately the way we defeat authoritarianism. Because back in the 1930s, we had a really powerful, far right in this country. We were actually seeing Nazi rallies in Madison Square Garden, it was filling the stadium. \n\nAnd the way we defeated that was FDR came in with the New Deal movement. He built this whole new economy and a whole new society that improved people’s lives so dramatically, it just killed this idea that you need an authoritarian to do it for you.\n\nHe proved democracy can work. And he did that through the social safety net. But he also did that by building an industrial base that created the modern-day middle class. So that’s really what the “Mission for America” is. It’s basically taking a lot of the institutions and the lessons from that era and saying, how do we do that today? Because I argue that it’s not just about some policies; it’s actually this whole other kind of governing that we had back then. This is going to get a little bit in the weeds — but we’re on a podcast, so I’m going to go there, all right?\n\nAL: Go for it. \n\nSC: So when you look at the way we used to govern in that era, it wasn’t just like FDR came in with his, like, three policies that are going to pass. No. It was a whole new framework for how to envision society. And he put the government into this mode that we’ve been calling “mission mode.” And in mission mode, it’s really different from how we govern today in three really distinct ways.\n\nOne is, you have a leader who actively puts the country on a mission and then follows up: makes civil society join in on the mission, persuades, uses action as a way to create political capital. So FDR did this through his fireside chats, but he also was very active in actually going out and recruiting CEOs to be a part of it. And if CEOs were standing in the way, he would call them out and kind of vilify them publicly as well, if they’re actually just preferring short-term profit over long-term prosperity.\n\nAnd the second piece is, in mission mode, you make comprehensive plans. So you say, “This is where we’re getting to,” and then you deliver those plans. You don’t just pass some policies and then take your hands off the steering wheel; that’s how we govern today.\n\nAnd the third piece is, you create institutions to finance and coordinate and execute those plans. We used to have a whole bunch of institutions like this all across our society.\n\nWe had public banks in every state. The largest by far was an institution called the Reconstruction Finance Corporation — that was kinda the engine of growth during the New Deal in the World War II mobilization. But after the war, we started dismantling all these planning and financing institutions for a whole bunch of reasons, I can get into that, but I think we’ve just forgotten that whole playbook.\n\nAnd so the “Mission for America” is this playbook that is a tried-and-true playbook — because it wasn’t just America. After the war, Europe used this playbook to get rich. All the Asian countries used a similar playbook to develop in the ’70s and ’80s and ’90s. They actually called it the American system.\n\nAnd so we got to do that again to actually show this other route to developing our economy, so that the authoritarians don’t win. So your answer to “How do you get it done?” It has to be, like, I’m imagining we’re going 2028, somebody running for president. We got hundreds of people who are running for Congress who are lined up on this overall vision the same way FDR came in with a whole new New Deal movement. He wasn’t advocating for going back to a pre-Great Depression era. He was advocating for something new. So that’s the way we get it done, and I see some movement towards that. \n\nI will say, I think some of the pieces of this have already become sort of common sense. Things like industrial policy, the Green New Deal managed to get that into the lexicon. The idea that we actually need to focus on the cost of living crisis, but not just say affordability — because plenty of Democrats say affordability — but it has to be backed up with real policy. I think that’s why you had Zohran win in New York. But it’s also why you had Mikie Sherrill win in New Jersey because she was calling for rate hike freezes against utilities and calling out the corporations that were getting in the way. So you need some substance. It’s not just messaging. You need substance.\n\nBut yeah, the answer at the end of the day is, we have to have a movement that’s really dedicated to doing this all the way, who aren’t bought out by the corporations. That’s another piece of it, right? You’re not sold out, and you’re not just in there to build a political career for you, which is what most people in Congress are.\n\nAL: I want to ask you a little bit about how you view the timing on this, because we’re talking about 2028. Right now, most Americans are thinking about, “How do I get through a day with the terror and chaos that is the second iteration of the Trump administration?”\n\nYou’ve also said that Justice Democrats in some ways was before its time, but that you feel like now there is momentum here. Why do you think right now is the time for this — particularly if you’re talking about two to three years in the future, where we have no idea what the political landscape is going to look like?\n\nAnd right now, obviously this is timely for your race, the disappointment with the Democratic Party is at an all-time high, but we don’t know where it’s going to be in 2028.\n\nSC: So I want to be clear, like the reason I’m talking about 2028 is, in 2026, we’re still going to have Trump as president, and I think the real work for 2026 is to start building this movement. And to actually get victories and get new people in there, and use that as a jumping-off point to doing the larger stuff and defining what 2028 is going to be. That’s going to be part of it. And actually stopping this coup — like that’s something I haven’t even touched on yet. But we actually need people in there who know how to stop what’s happening, who know how to stop the authoritarianism. Because if we don’t have fair and free elections in 2028, it’s game over anyway, right? So we actually have to stop that.\n\nBut why do I think it’s possible now? I’m seeing it in the campaign. Like in 2018, it was a similar moment. Trump had just won in 2016. A lot of Democrats were really frustrated with the party. Democrats were looking for what comes next. But a lot of people also thought it was maybe a fluke. And I’d say when we were working on all those Justice Democrats races in 2018, it was largely like progressive activists coming out, progressive activists who were getting involved. But a lot more new progressive activists who were coming into the fold. \n\nRight now, what I’m seeing in the race is — you know, I do these calls with voters in San Francisco every day; anyone can go to my website and sign up for a video call with me. The kinds of people showing up to those calls, it’s not just progressive activists. It’s like lifelong Pelosi voters; some mainstream Democrats; people who thought 2016 was a fluke but then Trump just won again and they’re like, clearly something is wrong. And they’re looking for those answers.\n\nAnd we just did a rally a couple of weeks ago in the Mission, and we had 800 people show up. It was so many people we couldn’t fit them in. And this is like almost a year out from the election. That kind of energy I did not see in 2018. So I think this is just a very different moment. The polling bears it out too. If you look at the Democratic Party’s polling amongst its own base against Trump, I mean, we’re polling worse than Trump, right?\n\nSo the party’s in an existential crisis. It has to be new people leading the party, and I’d say the mainstream of the party realizes that. So that’s, I think, the opportunity — because we’re in such a crisis. But yeah, I agree with you. In the short term, the problem is, how do you keep this coup from actually happening? And what can we actually do in the short term to actually fight where we have leverage, like on this frickin’ Senate budget bill?\n\nAL: On this, I want to push on this authoritarian thing — because what would you be doing, or what would you want to see Democrats in Congress doing that they’re not doing right now to stop Trump from doing what he’s doing, particularly in the minority?\n\nSC: Yeah, I think it boils down to three big things. One, I do think Democrats in positions of power could actually be showing up when, say, ICE is in our cities, kidnapping people off the streets. You have some privilege in your power. We saw [Mayor] Karen Bass do this to an extent in LA when ICE was rolling through MacArthur Park. She showed up and she said, “I’m not leaving until you do.” She put the ball in their court to escalate. So do it nonviolently, but you put it on them to escalate, and they really weren’t willing to go there.\n\nI think the second piece is, Democrats need to realize that their position as opposition leaders right now is not just about writing policy and legislation. We actually need to organize civil society. I think the way, the bulwark against fascism is civil society. So what I mean by that is, when Trump’s going after law firms or media companies or universities, he’s going after them one at a time, and they fall like dominoes, it’s easy. But if they could actually organize as collective blocks, they could be a real opposition.\n\nI’ve talked to some people who work at law firms who’ve been trying to do that. It’s very difficult for them to organize each other as peers. But if you have political backing behind you, if you have a legislator who’s actually trying to organize you, I think that’s something you do. Or similarly, like you see AOC or Bernie going around, doing the anti-oligarchy tour, drawing big crowds. Turn that into a real citizen force to be an actual bulwark against fascism.\n\nBut the third piece I’d say is a bit on messaging. It’s like when Trump oversteps his bounds, call it out and stick with it. And we saw this happen with Kilmar Ábrego García where Trump deported him to CECOT and then [Sen.] Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., went down there and wouldn’t leave and just stuck with it. And then Trump started seeing his numbers go down, and he got sent back.\n\nAnd it’s just this thing where, like the way authoritarianism works, it’s this constant process of them trying to make the abnormal normal. They’re pushing this tide and we have to be the force that’s constantly pushing that tide back, calling it out, keeping things abnormal abnormal. Because if we let them just do it — before we know it, it’s normal for them to own all the county election boards. It’s normal for them to own all the election machines. And it’s normal for them to stuff the ballot boxes, and then it’s game over. Right. So it’s daily work. It’s daily work. You just have to be fighting every single frickin’ day.\n\nAL: Switching gears to affordability, which you touched on a little earlier. This issue, cost of living, is top of mind for many, many voters, and you’ve said, “building millions of units of affordable housing and social housing” is a priority for you. How would you try to achieve that? Especially running in one of the country’s most expensive cities to live in? And I sympathize with you talking from New York. \n\nSC: Yes, you’re probably the second most expensive. But I really think of housing, the way we need to be thinking about housing is as infrastructure. You know, the way we think about building out our road systems or the way we think about building out our power grids. So what we actually need is real plans for the housing we have to build and then have every tool available to us to make it happen. \n\nSo part of that means the government directly funding and building social housing. Right now, it’s actually illegal for the government to build new public housing because of something called the Faircloth Amendment. So we should repeal that. But the other piece of this is like, we don’t have the institutions, like we don’t have a public bank that can directly finance social housing. And that’s something that I call for recreating. \n\nThings like right now material costs are really high. Well, if we had something like a modern day version of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation like I was talking about that FDR had, which is something I call for doing, we could do things like stockpile materials when costs are low so that we can try to keep inflation costs from hitting housing construction costs.\n\nSo it’s just this whole of society approach to try to just tackle this problem and actually build housing. Because building housing is not an impossible task. We’ve been doing it for hundreds of years, right? It’s just this matter of, we currently have this approach of just let’s do some deregulation there. Let’s, you know, do some policy reforms there and then see if the private markets will handle it. \n\nAnd I’m not someone who’s against making it easier and cheaper to construct housing. I absolutely think that’s also a problem in my city. And I think that’s also a problem in New York. And the way Zorhan talked about this was: We gotta cut red tape, build affordable housing and freeze the rent. Right? That’s basically my approach is we actually need to make it easier to construct housing, build the housing, and then the other piece of it is, actually get a control on costs. Get a control on speculation. That’s another piece I didn’t touch on, but get a control on hedge funds and private equity coming in, buying up housing, propping up the market, and making it unaffordable.\n\nAL: How do you define social housing? I just want to clarify here.\n\nSC: Yeah. Lots of ways to potentially define it. Yeah, that’s a good question.\n\nSo one route here is I think the government should have a public developer that can straight up go out and build the housing, right? That’s just something that we currently don’t have in our tool chest. The state owned corporations, for some reason, that’s supposed to be a taboo thing. It makes no sense.\n\nWe used to have it before. Plenty of countries do it this way, but also I think there is options for the government to say take equity stakes in housing developments as a way to control pricing there. Right? And that’s a model we saw in Montgomery County that’s worked really well for them. \n\nBut it boils down to like all of the above approach to making sure the housing gets built and that it’s actually affordable and people of all income levels can live in it.\n\nAL: You’ve touched on sort of changing the mindset and the way that we think about this, and instead of doing piecemeal deregulation, thinking about this as an institutional, a larger institutional shift. But why do you think you’ll be successful given that this is something that people have been trying to solve for years, particularly in San Francisco — the housing crisis?\n\nSC: Again, I think it boils down to can we have a mindset shift in the entire Democratic Party on how we approach not just housing, but all of our problems because this is sort of the theme of the larger idea I’m trying to push here. Is this how you solve problems in society in general? Like if we want to build a new clean energy economy, it’s not going to work to just do some tax incentives and do some deregulation here and there. You actually have to have a plan, a goal, milestones, and then use tools like financing and public developers and everything else you need to hit that goal. Execution matters just as much, if not more than passing the policies. And this is just, you know, I do have some experience getting these new ideas across the finish line through things like the Green New Deal.\n\nThat’s the approach I’m going to take with something like this, is I just got to get the ideas to happen and I want to recruit a movement of people who believe in this approach. I think it’s the approach that works, is the approach that’s worked historically. But yeah, I mean, I think the answer is we need new leaders who are willing to actually care about solutions and not just fundraising.\n\nAL: Relatedly, you, you talked a little bit about this in terms of your political development. San Francisco has been a bit of a dog whistle for the Trump administration on issues of crime and homelessness and addiction. I think back to the recall of District Attorney Chesa Boudin. I mean, where do you fall here and how would you respond to that kind of targeting if you represented this district in Congress? Because it sounds like you’re saying there are some elements of truth to this, and there are some elements that are Trump machinations, but where do you fall here?\n\nSC: Yeah. I mean, I honestly get really pissed off when I do see kind of essentially caricatures of this city, because if you come here, I mean, it’s an amazing city. It’s the greatest city on earth. It’s beautiful. Most of the city is doing great, but of course we have some problems. \n\nBut I am a big believer that if you look at the problems that we have, you really see versions of it everywhere. We have them particularly hard here because things like inequality, the cost of living are worse in San Francisco, and I think that’s the root cause of a lot of the issues that we see, whether it’s the homelessness we see on the streets, or even the drug addiction, mental health crises we see on the streets. But it’s really going all over the country. I think we have to actually solve these larger structural issues at a national level. \n\nAnd this is something I’m trying to really get across in my campaign is these are not problems San Francisco created on its own, it’s not problems San Francisco’s going to be able to solve on its own. Just to take one example. You know, if you look at our city budget, the largest driver of costs of our city employees is healthcare benefits. And the only answer a city can have to that is cutting more and more services, right? Like that’s basically the approach we have because the city has to balance its budget. So we have to solve healthcare at a national level if we want to save our cities.\n\nAnd that’s why what I’m talking about these structural things that we have to do at a national level that I think both parties have just ignored for decades has just come to a breaking point. So, yeah, I think that’s the way we tackle San Francisco’s biggest problems.\n\nAL: One of the moderate groups that helped shape the 2022 recalls of Chesa Boudin and several San Francisco school board members, Grow SF has said you might have a shot at winning, particularly if you focus on issues that matter to moderate voters in San Francisco. What do you make of that?\n\nSC: You know, I don’t think it’s about progressive versus moderate. And this is kind of my take on the country as a whole. I really think you’re just going to keep getting backlash politics to dysfunction and failure of governance. And I think that’s really what we saw in San Francisco.\n\nI think when you look at the recall elections that happened, it was a reaction to just general dysfunction at the city government. It was a reaction to COVID, honestly, resulting in a lot of disorder on our streets. And my view on it is, yeah, we elected in a new “moderate government,” but if they fail to actually govern well, there’s going to be a backlash to that as well.\n\nAnd nationally, I’m seeing this in the same way that you see people voting for Obama and then Trump, and then Biden, and then Trump again. Is just that nothing is working. People are looking for change. They’re looking for real structural solutions to these big problems. So I agree with GrowSF that I do have a shot, I’m going to win this race.\n\nBut I don’t think it’s just about appealing to moderate voters. If you ask most voters, of course, most voters will say they’re moderate, but you ask them like, “What do you think needs to happen?” Views are actually all over the place, but the thing that they’re right about is you do have to talk about the real issues that are affecting people’s lives and how are you actually going to solve them.\n\nSo I would argue everything I’m talking about solving those issues, they’re all overwhelmingly popular. So I guess definitionally, they’re moderate or centrist, who knows? But they’re also, you know, they make sense. They’re just practical.\n\nAL: I want to talk about the Democratic Socialists of America. On the national stage, they’re having a huge moment after Zohran Mamdani’s success in New York. He’s one of the hottest politicians in the country right now. And some of your supporters and other people have compared you to. Even though it’s a national brand, DSA is made up of local chapters and the San Francisco DSA has bristled at that comparison between yourself and Mamdani, pointing out that you supported a local centrist Democrat who ousted the only Democratic socialist on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. Are you trying to court DSA’s support, and if so, how do you plan to get them on your side? And if not, why not?\n\nSC: Yeah. I mean, basically, the way I run my campaigns every time is I run on what I’m running on and if people want to support that, great. I’ll always talk to everybody, right? Like I’ll of course talk to DSA San Francisco. I’ll talk to other folks as well. But to kind of talk about, you know, the specific thing DSA San Francisco is upset about, like, I would not say the person I supported was a centrist.\n\nI backed him because I’ve known him for a while. We worked together on legislation in the state. We wrote an op-ed together about a Green New Deal for California. And, you know, since being elected, I haven’t agreed with everything he’s done. But I really think he is a good guy who’s a progressive, who was trying to chart this path that was about how do we actually do progressive things. He was good on criminal justice reform while also making sure we’re building housing in the city, especially affordable housing as well. And I think he’s a real problem solver, you know. And it’s interesting, in the past, he actually got a lot of crap from the “abundant YIMBY” people because he was supporting the progressive in one of their races, right? So he was trying to chart this new path and I think that’s admirable. \n\nThat’s like something I would like to do as well. We can’t— I think we have this weird polarization, especially in San Francisco between these two factions and there is a version of the YIMBY faction that’s just like, you know, neoliberalism, like “let’s just deregulate; let the private markets rip.” I don’t agree with that, but I think there’s a lot of folks who actually want to use every tool to make sure we’re building all the housing we need. And similarly, in DSA, I have a lot of folks from DSA who are volunteering on the campaign and it seems like there’s a split there too, where there’s some folks who are a bit more like, you know, YIMBY-DSA people, right? \n\nAnd I’d argue Zohran is kind of in that camp. So, yeah, I mean, I’m not going to shy away from saying I like what Zohran did because I like what he did. You know, I’m not trying to say I’m Zohran at all. But it’s very exciting to me to see him win. But at the end of the day, I am trying to run perhaps a new lane of politics.\n\nLike we actually have to do the things like expand the social safety net. We actually have to do things like Medicare for All, and we have to build industry, we have to build housing, we have to do all of these building projects to make life better for people. \n\nNow one thing that sometimes gets conflated with is, you know, the influence of tech money and oligarchy in both national politics and locally. And I want to be clear, that is a bad thing that has a corrupting influence. And in that election that I supported Bilal [Mahmood], he was very clear that he doesn’t want Elon Musk. I mean, it sucks that like the tech fascists were trying to get involved in that election, but Bilal told Elon to go fuck himself.\n\nAnd so I want to be clear that they are my enemy, right? Like the the fascists who have lined up with Donald Trump — Peter Thiel, Elon Musk, David Sacks — they are doing a craven coward project of cowardice where they’re just doing political opportunism to enrich themselves, and they absolutely have to be called out on that and cut out from power in the long run.\n\nBut I do hope we can get to a place where we are actually solving these problems.\n\nAL: I have to ask, because you mentioned it. What is your abundance take?\n\nSC: It’s, yeah, I mean, I did a long podcast with Ezra Klein on it. But I mean, look, when we did the Green New Deal that was abundance, like we were talking about, we got to actually do energy abundance. We have to actually do this to create high wage industries so people have tens of millions of jobs. But my argument, my critique of the abundance folks, is that a lot of the times I see them falling to a camp of, “Oh, if we just did the exact right permitting reform or zoning reform or deregulation, we would get abundance.” And I think that’s completely unrealistic. \n\nIf you look at the history of every country that’s ever developed their economies — and I’m talking about all of post-war Europe, all the Asian countries, America during the World War II mobilization — it has never happened by just having the right permitting, you know, guidelines. You actually have to do this mission driven approach, which has been what I’ve been pushing for the last decade in my politics. It really is how do you actually do it, which is huge amounts of state capacity, public financing, comprehensive plans. You set the country on a mission and you just go for it. \n\nSo that’s my answer is like, yeah, I mean, great, like I would be all for getting rid of the counterproductive regulations that currently get in the way of building things that everybody needs. But that’s not going to be enough. You know, it’s not even going to be close to enough. We have to do way more than that, if we are serious about abundance.\n\nAL: The race to win the San Francisco district is already shaping up to be competitive among Democrats. Most widely recognized of the candidates, State Senator Scott Wiener announced his candidacy last month. In Sacramento, Weiner has fought to increase housing density and protect transgender rights. Board of Supervisor Connie Chan has not officially thrown in her hat but is believed to be considering and could potentially secure the support of the city’s most powerful unions. Former San Francisco Mayor London Breed has also said she’s considering a run. What makes you stand out from the pack? You haven’t held public office before, why do you think you’re the right person for the job now? \n\nSC: Yeah, I mean, first off, I’m the only one here that’s talking about actually doing the political revolution inside the party to get us to a point where we can do the big structural changes.\n\nI don’t know what the theory of change is for any of these other folks who are running, because what are you going to do? You know, someone like Senator Wiener or any of the folks running, like if you’re just going to go in and be another Democrat in the current system and not talk about changing the system, what are you going to actually accomplish? How are you going to accomplish anything? I don’t know. You know, maybe they have some answer to that, but I haven’t heard it. \n\nSo, and I’d say like the other piece of this where I do have a difference from someone like Senator Wiener. I mean, Senator Wiener has been in government in San Francisco in some form for the last 14 years. And his main focus has been housing. And in that time, I mean, rents in San Francisco have more than doubled. We have a housing crisis. I wouldn’t say he’s been successful in the outcomes on what his focus has been. But also it’s really different to be a state senator in a largely Democratic Sacramento where you’re passing some legislation reforms here and there. \n\nI’d say in Congress, we have to figure out how to get past the gridlock. And that is what I have experience doing. I mean, when I was in charge of writing and launching a Green New Deal as AOC’s chief of staff, and that wasn’t just a policy that we’re trying to pass. It was a political strategy because at that time, the entire Democratic caucus was just trying to talk about carbon taxes and cap and trade. And we came in and said, A, actually, this is not going to do anything for climate change. But B, it’s politically stupid. You’re talking about punishing people as a way to solve climate change. What we actually need to do is talk about building the clean high wage, high tech industries that’ll create tens of millions of jobs. The crisis of climate change is in fact the greatest opportunity in our generation to reverse decades of economic devastation. And we were saying the plans out there were just way too small. \n\nAnd so the way we introduced the Green New Deal was AOC did a sit-in, in Speaker Pelosi’s office on her first day in D.C., which was this huge act of political courage. She joined [the] Sunrise Movement and then we did inside-outside organizing with Sunrise. Sunrise was doing sit-ins while I was calling up the staffers on the inside to get them onto Green New Deal. And then we did that with the presidential candidates. And Sunrise would go into town halls while I was calling up the, you know, the staffers on the campaigns for president. \n\nAnd the result of that was every single person running for president had to respond. And they did. They responded with their own ambitious plans for climate. Even Joe Biden who responded with the Build Back Better. And that turned into [the] Inflation Reduction Act, which wasn’t everything I wanted, but it was the largest investment in climate change and clean manufacturing in the history of this country.\n\nSo that’s the kind of experience I bring. So if you’re someone who thinks we need to tackle these structural problems and have someone who’s going to creatively work to actually push through new ideas, that’s what I’m running for.\n\nAL: Closing out, I’m going to ask you about Nancy Pelosi, the person you’re running to replace. How do you view her legacy?\n\nSC: I’ve been pretty respectful of her. You know, I do think she has had a long career and she’s done a lot of good stuff in that time. I think especially when she first came in, she was kind of this fearless voice calling out attention to the AIDS epidemic that was ravaging San Francisco at the time, and it wasn’t necessarily popular countrywide. But it worked like she managed to get help and money into the district and provide real relief for people.\n\nYou know, I think, I would say like I’m also honestly struck by the level of leadership it took for her to step down because that is something that we don’t see a lot of people in D.C. do. I think it’s going to result in people remembering her for what she did, rather than her just being in there too long like people like RBG and Diane Feinstein.\n\nAnd the reason I ran this race in the first place was, I was really saying, you know, speaker Pelosi, former Speaker Pelosi, she’s had this long career, she had some skills but we are in this era where we need new ideas, we need new leaders, we need people who are going to push the party in a new direction. I just don’t think that’s what her role is and that’s what she was necessarily in the position to be able to do. So, yeah, I’ve got a lot of respect for her, but I’m glad she was able to make the decision to pass the torch.\n\nAL: Do you want her endorsement?\n\nSC: That’s for her to make. I mean, look, I’m going to run the race, I run. And this is how I always run any race, it’s on me to prove myself and prove that this campaign is worth it. And so anybody who wants to be a part of that campaign, anybody who wants to endorse, who thinks they see themselves in this, welcome to have your endorsement.\n\nAL: I understand what you’re saying, but can you explain if she decided to endorse you, why you would welcome it if you were previously running against her?\n\nSC: I mean, I don’t, I just don’t think it’s going to be a problem, because I’m pretty sure she’s not going to offer an endorsement given that I just primaried her. I mean, come on. \n\nAL: The thought exercise. Let’s do the, let’s do the thought exercise. I’m just try, I’m trying to get at this tension between having criticism for someone and still having respect for them and how you see sort of—\n\nSC: Because it’s a criticism, it’s a criticism of a system, right? It’s a criticism of the Democratic Party. So if somebody realizes that, “Oh, actually Saikat was right,” I mean, this is really getting outlandish. But say, Nancy Pelosi suddenly says, “OK. You know what, Saikat, you were right to challenge me. You were right that we need real change in the party. You were right that we need new ideas. So I’d like to endorse you.” I will always accept people changing their minds and coming over. I’m never going to say no just because I disagreed with you in the past. I’ll never accept anything you say. A key thing here is I’m not going to change who I am or what I’m running on to get anybody’s endorsement.\n\nI’m going to run what I’m running on. I’m going to run the way I’m running, I’m going to run still calling out Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer and all the leadership that’s failing us right now. And so if you think that’s the race you want to be a part of, great. But if you think you’re going to change me to get an endorsement, sorry, it’s not going to happen.\n\nAL: You’ve been very openly saying Hakeem Jeffries should be primaried. What’s your take on Schumer? Where do you stand on him particularly after this shutdown showdown? \n\nSC: I mean, he should absolutely be primary. I mean, there’s no question. Chuck Schumer has completely failed as leader for Senate. This is— He’s getting too many chances and he’s completely out of step with the party and frankly, I think he’s damaging the party, especially when it came to something like the Zohran race in New York, where Schumer, he never endorsed. As far as I know, he didn’t even say if he voted for him.\n\nAL: Saikat Chakrabarti, thank you for joining me on the Intercept Briefing.\n\nSC: Thank you.

They were reading the room.","text":"“Nevada isn’t a blue state — it’s a swing state with a Democratic lean and a Republican trend line,” said Mike Noble, a pollster who focuses on the Southwest. “Both senators are reading the room, and brinksmanship doesn’t play well with the middle.”\n\nThe GOP advantage in Nevada has been building for several years. Republicans overtook Democrats in voter registration for the first time in nearly two decades this year, the result of a dedicated campaign from the Nevada Republican Party. Polls show GOP Gov. Joe Lombardo with a slight lead in his reelection bid, which will be one of the most competitive gubernatorial races next year. And Republicans are trying to flip Democrats’ three House seats in Nevada next year. In 2024, Donald Trump became the first Republican to win the state in 20 years, beating Kamala Harris by 3.1 points, while Rosen won reelection by just 1 point.\n\n“Nevada has really tightened up,” said Robert Uithoven, a GOP strategist from the state .\n\nRepublicans and Democrats are fiercely courting Nevada’s working class. In 2024, Trump appealed to the state’s service, hospitality and construction industries with promises to end taxes on tips and overtime — both policies that were passed in the GOP’s “Big Beautiful Bill.” And his campaign also made significant investment in reaching Latinos, who make up one in five registered voters.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, are hoping that the sluggish economy, GOP-backed healthcare cuts and aggressive deportations under Trump will help them win back anxious Nevadans.\n\n“If you hear someone who is saying we are not going to tax your tips, that’s compelling,” said Washoe County Commission Chair Alexis Hill, who is running in the Democratic gubernatorial primary. “That economic message is consistently what we need to drive home as Democrats and get away from that corporate message.”\n\nNevada’s economy is tethered to the tourism industry, fueled by hourly-wage hospitality workers. The state has seen a massive downturn in travel this year after major post-pandemic increases, which — coupled with a sharp dropoff in construction jobs — sparked concern among economists and local officials, who largely gauge the health of the local economy on its tourism industry.\n\nThe state’s heavy reliance on federal aid also makes it more susceptible to partisan swings. The freeze on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program resulting from the government shutdown hurt the 15 percent of Nevadans who receive SNAP benefits, among the highest shares of any state. And recent disruptions around air travel significantly affected flights coming and going from Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas. On Saturday, the airport recorded 198 flight delays.","url":"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/14/nevada-democrats-shutdown-trump-economy-00651339","image":"https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/1ceb565/2147483647/resize/1200x/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F47%2F26%2F1beb046d49468116fc0a3e55f93f%2Fu-s-congress-30162.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-14 10:00:00","author":"Liz Crampton,Natalie Fertig,Samuel Benson","authors":["Liz Crampton","Natalie Fertig","Samuel Benson"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.253},{"id":379078124,"title":"BBC apologizes to Trump over its misleading edit, but says there's no basis for a defamation claim","text":"LONDON -- The BBC apologized Thursday to U.S. President Donald Trump over a misleading edit of his speech on Jan. 6, 2021 but said it had not defamed him, rejecting the basis for his $1 billion lawsuit threat.\n\nThe BBC said Chair Samir Shah sent a personal letter to the White House saying that he and the corporation were sorry for the edit of the speech Trump gave before some of his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol as Congress was poised to certify President-elect Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 election that Trump falsely alleged was stolen from him.\n\nThe publicly funded broadcaster said there are no plans to rebroadcast the documentary, which had spliced together parts of his speech that came almost an hour apart.\n\n“We accept that our edit unintentionally created the impression that we were showing a single continuous section of the speech, rather than excerpts from different points in the speech, and that this gave the mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action,\" the BBC wrote in a retraction.\n\nTrump’s lawyer had sent the BBC a letter demanding an apology and threatened to file a $1 billion lawsuit for the harm the documentary caused him. It had set a Friday deadline for the BBC to respond.\n\nWhile the BBC statement doesn’t respond to Trump’s demand that he be compensated for “overwhelming financial and reputational harm,\" the headline on its news story about the apology said it refused to pay compensation.\n\nThe dispute was sparked by an edition of the BBC’s flagship current affairs series “Panorama,” titled “Trump: A Second Chance?” broadcast days before the 2024 U.S. presidential election.\n\nThe third-party production company that made the film spliced together three quotes from two sections of the 2021 speech into what appeared to be one quote in which Trump urged supporters to march with him and “fight like hell.”\n\nAmong the parts cut out was a section where Trump said he wanted supporters to demonstrate peacefully.\n\nDirector-General Tim Davie, along with news chief Deborah Turness, quit Sunday, saying the scandal was damaging the BBC and “as the CEO of BBC News and Current Affairs, the buck stops with me.”\n\nThe letter from Trump's lawyer demanded an apology to the president and a “full and fair” retraction of the documentary along with other “false, defamatory, disparaging, misleading or inflammatory statements” about Trump.\n\nLegal experts have said that Trump would face challenges taking the case to court in the U.K. or the U.S. They said that the BBC could show that Trump wasn’t harmed because he was ultimately elected president in 2024.\n\nDeadlines to bring the case in English courts, where defamation damages rarely exceed 100,000 pounds ($132,000) expired more than a year ago. Because the documentary was not shown in the U.S., it would be hard to show that Americans thought less of him because of a program they could not watch.\n\nWhile many legal experts have dismissed the president’s claims against the media as having little merit, he has won some lucrative settlements against U.S. media companies and he could try to leverage the BBC mistake for a payout, potentially to a charity of his choice.\n\nIn July, Paramount, which owns CBS, agreed to pay $16 million to settle a lawsuit filed by Trump over a “ 60 Minutes” interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump alleged that the interview was edited to enhance how Harris, the Democratic nominee for president in 2024, sounded.\n\nThat settlement came as the Trump-appointed head of the Federal Communications Commission launched an investigation that threatened to complicate Paramount’s need for administration approval to merge with Skydance Media.\n\nLast year, ABC News said it would pay $15 million to settle a defamation lawsuit over anchor George Stephanopoulos ’ inaccurate on-air assertion that the president-elect had been found civilly liable for raping writer E. Jean Carroll. A jury found that he was liable for sexually abusing her.\n\nThe apology and retraction came as BBC said it was looking into a report in the Daily Telegraph that its Newsnight program in 2022 had similarly spliced together parts of the same speech by Trump.","summary":"The BBC has apologized to U.S. President Donald Trump over a misleading edit of his speech on Jan. 6, 2021 but said it strongly disagreed that there was a basis for a defamation lawsuit","url":"https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/bbc-apologizes-trump-misleading-edit-basis-defamation-claim-127502462","image":"https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/ae73297f-17ad-4efe-93d9-01ae90c64d26/wirestory_73a613283de952f5af08fa8ec4d0ca67_16x9.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-14 07:41:52","author":"Brian Melley Associated Press","authors":["Brian Melley Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.58}]}
