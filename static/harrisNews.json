But his complicated love life has drawn comparisons to something out of an imperial court — full of intrigue, suspicion and power struggles.\n\nSt. Clair, 26, outed herself after the 53-year-old Musk’s public appearances with his other children — and with their mothers, too.\n\nBefore her sensational claim, St. Clair was known as a right-wing culture warrior on X with sassy conservative takes — such as claiming that then-VP Kamala Harris “can’t help herself from bending over for a man to get ahead.”\n\nNow St. Clair appears to be publicly fighting for attention from Musk — who has made no secret of his desire to have a big family and has often appeared in public with his son X Æ A-12, who he shares with pop singer Grimes.\n\nX Æ A-12, known as “Lil X,” has been a frequent feature of Musk’s public appearances in the past year. He played a huge role alongside his father at the inauguration of President Donald Trump with his playful antics, garnering media attention. \n\nThe 4-year-old also threatened to steal the show while in the Oval Office with his dad and Trump for the signing of an executive order last week.\n\nAnother of the mothers of Musk’s children, Neuralink exec Shivon Zilis, has been a feature at Musk’s side at some of his recent public appearances lately, too — playing with her two children as well as X at one point while the tech chief held a meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nThe psychodrama involving St. Clair and Musk has ramped up in recent days, with her telling The Post that she faces threats and vile abuse from his fans.\n\nMusk hasn’t out-right confirmed St. Clair’s claims of sharing a child with him.\n\nOn Sunday, Musk was conspicuously quiet on X after a weekend of rampant posting.\n\nIt may have been Valentine’s Day, but St. Clair was not feeling the love when she took to the Musk-owned X platform to claim he is her baby daddy.\n\nSt. Clair, who previously worked at the conservative satire site The Babylon Bee, said she had given birth last fall.\n\nIn a subsequent interview with The Post, St. Clair described Musk as “down to earth,” saying he wanted to keep their son a secret for everyone’s safety.\n\nBut in a plotline that reads like a soap opera, Musk and St. Clair soon got into a social media feud, with the Tesla and Space X CEO responding to a post that claimed his youngest baby mama had worked for five years to “ensnare” him, with him writing simply, “whoa.”\n\nIn a since-deleted post, St. Clair then accused Musk of refusing to speak to her and of responding publicly to “smears” shared online.\n\nThe spat has drawn the ire of many female conservative influencers, including “trad wife” H. Pearl Davis, who replied to St. Clair’s original statement on X by writing sarcastically, “Congrats on single motherhood!!!”\n\nBethany Mandel, a columnist for the Deseret News and Ricochet, also mocked St. Clair, sharing a screengrab of her response to Musk on her X and writing, “I strongly recommend having a baby daddy who lives in your house, so that you don’t have to tweet him.”\n\nMusk has reportedly fathered at least 12 children with four different women over 22 years.\n\nHis wide-ranging dalliances have been compared to Imperial Chinese concubines and their battle to be close to the throne, with even Grimes appearing to acknowledge the similarities as she wrote “lol,” in response to a viral X thread about the comparisons.\n\nIn 2002, his ex-wife Justine Wilson gave birth to his first child, a son, Nevada Alexander, who tragically died at just 10 weeks old.\n\nHe would go on to have five more children with Justine, including twins Vivian and Griffin, born in 2004 — and triplets Damian, Kai, and Saxon, born in 2006.\n\nVivian came out as transgender in 2022 shortly before legally changing her name to remove the surname Musk.\n\nAccording to Musk’s biographer, he has accused Vivian of being a “communist” who thinks that “anyone rich is evil,” while also blaming her left-wing views on the progressive private school that he sent her to in California.\n\nMusk had an on-off relationship with actress Amber Heard between 2017 and 2018, after the pair met at the previous year’s Met Gala.\n\nHowever, Musk called the fling with Johnny Depp’s ex-wife “brutal” and “mind-bogglingly painful,” according to his biographer, and the pair went their separate ways citing their busy schedules as the reason.\n\nHe was first linked with pop star Grimes in 2018 and two years later, she gave birth to their first child Lil X — Musk’s seventh — in 2020.\n\nMusk and Grimes share two other children — a daughter, Exa Dark Sideræl, born 2021, and a boy, Techno Machinus, born 2023.\n\nCourt papers from Travis County, Texas, and shared by Insider revealed in 2021 that Musk had fathered two children with Zilis, an executive at Neuralink, one of his companies.\n\nIn 2024, Zilis gave birth to a third child with Musk, although their sex and name has yet to be announced.\n\nMusk has been largely quiet on the baby drama on X since St. Clair’s statement dropped, sharing a number of posts instead regarding the latest iteration of his chatbot, Grok.\n\nMusk has made no secret of his desire to have a big family, writing in a July 2022 X post to his followers that he was, “doing my best to help the underpopulation crisis. A collapsing birth rate is the biggest danger civilization faces by far.”\n\nHis growing family has met with the approval of many of his fans, with one posting on X that Musk’s latest baby was yet another of his “side quests,” a remark that drew a crying laughing emoji from the billionaire.\n\nIn October, it was reported by the New York Times that he had purchased a 14,000-square-foot compound in Austin for his kids, along with adjoining properties for two of the three mothers of his children.","summary":"Conservative influencer Ashley St. Clair has claimed she gave birth to Elon Musk's 13th child last year.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/02/16/us-news/how-ashley-st-clair-fits-into-elon-musks-tangled-love-life/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/Comp-Ashley.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/B5YxQKPh-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-02-16 22:48:23","author":"Anthony Blair","authors":["Anthony Blair"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.086},{"id":291179000,"title":"Former Biden official Jen Psaki slams Kamala for campaigning with Liz Cheney","text":"Former Biden White House press secretary Jen Psaki slammed former Vice President Kamala Harris for closing her presidential campaign by campaigning with Liz Cheney and relying on \"elite language,\" that failed to connect with voters. \"I don't think closing the campaign with a message about fighting democracy with a former Republican member of Congress was the right strategy,\" Psaki told Jon Stewart on his \"The Weekly Show\" podcast on Friday.

Jamie Raskin, Democrat of MarylandClick here to browse full transcripts from 2025 of \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington.And this week on Face the Nation: President Trump's national security team takes his MAGA movement to Europe. We will talk to Secretary of State Marco Rubio in his first Sunday show interview since taking office.Newly confirmed Trump administration officials took the president's shock- and-awe tour overseas last week. In Munich, the vice president blasted some of America's closest allies about their style of democracy.(Begin VT)J.D. VANCE (Vice President of the United States): The threat that I worry the most about vis-a-vis Europe is not Russia. It's not China. It's not any other external actor. And what I worry about is the threat from within.(End VT)MARGARET BRENNAN: Also on the agenda, pushing those same allies to make Europe great again by stepping up their efforts to protect Ukraine, while the administration says they will begin direct talks with Russia to end the war.Secretary of State Marco Rubio joins us from Israel, as the negotiations with Hamas to end that conflict enter a crucial stage.Back home, more pink slips for federal employees go out and the scrutiny of Elon Musk's role as the hatchet man for those agencies intensifies.Meanwhile, inflation is up. We will talk with the president's chief economic adviser about what the administration can do to curb it.It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.Good morning, and welcome to \"Face the Nation.\"We want to begin today with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who is in Jerusalem on the second leg of his trip through Europe and the Middle East.Mr. Secretary, I know it's the evening hours there, and you've had a long day. We appreciate your time. You've got quite a busy schedule.You met earlier with Prime Minister Netanyahu. He said he's lockstep with the Trump administration, but he can't share details on – quote – \"when the gates of hell will be open if all our hostages are not released.\"Did he tell you he wants to keep talks going to get to phase two of this hostage deal?MARCO RUBIO (U.S. Secretary of State): Well, I think we share a common goal. We want to see every hostage released.Frankly, I think – and the president has said this – we want to see them out as soon as we possibly can. And – and, certainly, you know, the world has watched these images of people – and it's just heartbreaking to remember that some of them have been now almost two years there. It's a horrifying situation.So we coordinate and work very close with them. We share the goal that every hostage needs to come home, every single one, without delay. Obviously, the – there are details of how we're pursuing that and coordinating that we're not going to share publicly because we don't want to endanger the hostages and we don't want to endanger this process.But suffice it to say that, if it was up to us, every one of these hostages would be home right now, and we want it to happen as soon as possible.MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. So, the deal stands?SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Again, we want every hostage out as soon as possible.MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: We will – and we want to see them home.There are some that are supposed to – under the deal, there are some that are supposed to be released coming up next weekend. We expect that to happen, but we'd like to see them all come out. We're not going to – we're not in favor of waiting weeks and weeks.Now, that may be the process that's in place because of the deal, but we would like to see them all out as soon as possible, and we continue to coordinate. And that – that's what we'd like to see as the outcome.MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Who wouldn't want all these hostages to be home and with their families?MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood.Want to ask you about Iran as well. President Trump has said he wants a diplomatic deal with Iran. Are you reaching out to them? And alongside that, does the U.S. support a preemptive strike by Israel on Iran to take out its nuclear program?SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, first of all, Israel will always have to act in what they believe is their national interest and their national defense.And so I'm not going to speak about whatever strategies they may have on this or any other topic. I will say that we don't have any outreach from Iran. We haven't seen any. And, ultimately, we've seen in the past that efforts that Iran has undertaken diplomatically have been only about how to extend the time frame that – but continue to enrich and re – and – and in addition to sponsor terrorism, in addition to build these long-range weapons, in addition to sow instability throughout the region.But let's be clear. There's been zero outreach or interest to date from Iran about any negotiated deal. Ideally, yes, I would love to wake up one day and hear the news that Iran has decided not to pursue a nuclear weapon, not to sponsor terrorism, and reengage in the world as a – as a – as a normal government.We've had no indication of any of that, not just now, but for 30 years.MARGARET BRENNAN: So you head from Israel to Saudi Arabia next. I know you'll be talking about Gaza, but we've also learned that Saudi Arabia is trying to facilitate this diplomacy with Russia about Ukraine.Which Russian officials do you expect to be meeting with? And what will the focus of your talks there be? Do you actually believe Vladimir Putin is ready to negotiate and make concessions?SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, here's what I know.I know President Trump spoke to Vladimir Putin last week. And, in it, Vladimir Putin expressed his interest in peace, and the president expressed his desire to see an end to this conflict in a way that was enduring and that protected Ukrainian sovereignty, and that was an enduring peace, not that we're going to have another invasion in three or four years.That's a good call. Now, obviously, it has to be followed up by action. So, the next few weeks and days will determine whether it's serious or not. Ultimately, one phone call does not make peace. One phone call does not solve a war as complex as this one.But I can tell you that Donald Trump is the only leader in the world that could potentially begin that process. Other leaders have tried. They have not been able to do so. When he ran in his campaign and he was elected as president, one of his promises was, he would work to bring an end to this conflict in a way that's sustainable and fair.And, obviously, you know, this is the first step in that process, but we have a long ways to go. Again, one call doesn't make it. One meeting wouldn't make it. This – there's a lot of work to be done. But I – I thought it has – you know, even the longest journey begins with the first step.So we'll see what happens from here, hopefully good things.MARGARET BRENNAN: Who will you be meeting with?SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, nothing's been finalized yet. I was scheduled to be in Saudi Arabia anyways.We invited – we announced that trip a week ago, and – a week-and-a-half ago. So, ultimately, look, if at any point in time there's an opportunity to continue the work that President Trump started last week to begin to create an opening for a broader conversation, that it would involve Ukraine and would involve the end of the war, and would involve our allies all over the world, particularly in Europe, we're going to explore it, if that opportunity presents itself.I don't have any details for you this morning, other than to say that we stand ready to follow the president's lead on this and begin to explore ways, if those opportunities present itself, to begin a process towards peace.Now, a process towards peace is not a one-meeting thing. This war has been going on for a while.MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: It's difficult. It's complicated. It's been bloody. It's been costly. So it will not be easy to end the conflict in this.And there are other parties at stake that have opinions on this as well. The European Union has sanctions as well. The Ukrainians are obviously fighting this war. It's their country, and they're on the front lines. So, one meeting isn't going to solve it.But I want to reiterate the president made clear he wants to end this war, and if opportunities present themselves to further that, we're going to take them if they present themselves. We'll see what happens over the next few days.MARGARET BRENNAN: But, to be clear, Keith Kellogg, who is the envoy appointed to help with these talks, says these are going to be parallel negotiations, meaning the Ukrainians and Russians aren't talking to each other yet.When you meet with your Russian counterpart, whoever that is, are you going to be sitting there arguing Ukraine's position?SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, first of all, I think that we have to understand is, right now, there is no process.MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: What – what we have right now is a call between Putin and President Trump in which both sides expressed an interest in ending this conflict.I imagine there will be follow-up conversations to figure out what a process to talk about that would look like. And then, at that point, perhaps we can begin to share more details. So it's a bit premature. I know there's been a lot of reaction to it, because there's been no conversation about it, any serious conversation.But I want to go back to the point I made. President Trump ran. He was very clear. He thinks this war needs to end. And if he sees an opportunity to end it, which is what he's looking for, whether there is an opportunity or not, we're going to pursue it.Ultimately, it will reach a point when you are – if it's real negotiations, and we're not there yet, but if that were to happen, Ukraine will have to be involved, because they're the one that were invaded, and the Europeans will have to be involved because they're the – they have sanctions on Putin and Russia as well, and – and they've contributed to this effort.MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: We're just not there yet. We really aren't, but hopefully we will be, because we'd all like to see this war end.MARGARET BRENNAN: No doubt.The last administration did have contact through the intelligence agencies with Russia, but they didn't believe there was any proof that Vladimir Putin was interested in talks. You know the history with Vladimir Putin. He likes to use diplomacy as a cover to distract while he continues to wage war.Do you trust that this time is different?SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Yes, I don't think, in geopolitics, anyone should trust anyone. I think these things have to be verified through actions.I said yesterday that peace is not a noun. It's a verb. It's an action. You have to take concrete steps towards it. What I can tell you is, I know of no better negotiator in American politics than President Trump.MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: I don't – I think President Trump will know very quickly whether to say, is this a real thing or whether this is an effort to buy time.But I don't want to prejudge that. I don't want to foreclose the opportunity to end a conflict that's already cost the lives of hundreds of thousands and continues every single day to be increasingly a war of attrition on both sides.I think everyone should be celebrating the fact that we have an American president that is seeking to promote peace in the world, not start wars, but end them, in a way that's enduring.MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: That's something we should be happy about. Whether it's possible or not, we're certainly willing, but it's not entirely up to us, obviously, but we'll find out.MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you did speak in a phone call with Russia's top diplomat, Sergey Lavrov. The Russian side claimed that you discussed restoring trade, which seemed to be a nod to sanctions, easing restrictions on diplomats, and other gestures like a high-level leaders meeting.Are you actually considering, is the Trump administration considering lifting sanctions on Russia?SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, the phone call was to establish communications that are consistent with the call the president made last week with Vladimir Putin, because if we are – if there is going to be the possibility of – of progress here towards peace, we are going to need to talk to the Russians.I mean, that is going to have to happen, and we're going to have to be able to be able to do it across our channels.MARGARET BRENNAN: About lifting sanctions, though?SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: I also raised in that conversation concerns that – well, we didn't go into any details.I mean, what we just discussed is basically the ability to begin communicating. I had never spoken to Mr. Lavrov in my life, so it was an opportunity for us to begin to open that channel of communication, which, again, if there's the potential for peace here, that's a channel that has to exist.But let me add one more thing. I also raised the issue of our embassy in Moscow, which operates under very difficult conditions. I raised that because it's important. It's going to be very difficult to engage in communication with Russia about anything if our embassy is not functioning. And he raised concerns about his diplomatic mission in the United States.So, at a very basic level, if, in fact, there is going to be an opportunity here to pursue peace by engaging with the Russians, we're going to need to have functional embassies in Moscow and in Washington, D.C., and that's certainly something foreign ministers would talk about as a matter of normal course.MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about what happened in Munich, Germany, at the Security Conference.Vice President Vance gave a speech, and he told U.S. allies that the threat he worries about the most is not Russia. It is not China. He called it the threat from within, and he lectured about what he described as censorship, mainly focusing, though, on including more views from the right.He also met with the leader of a far-right party known as the AfD, which, as you know, is under investigation and monitoring by German intelligence because of extremism. What did all of this accomplish, other than irritating our allies?SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Why would our allies or anybody be irritated by free speech and by someone giving their opinion?We are, after all, democracies. The Munich – Munich Security Conference is largely a conference of democracies, in which one of the things that we cherish and value is the ability to speak freely and provide your opinions.And so I think if anyone's angry about his words, they don't have to agree with him, but to be angry about it, I think, actually makes his point. I thought it was actually a pretty historic speech. Whether you agree with him or not, I think the valid points he's making to Europe is, we are concerned that the true values that we share, the values that bind us together with Europe are things like free speech and democracy and our shared history in winning two World Wars and defeating Soviet communism and the like.These are the values that we shared in common. And, in that Cold War, we fought against things like censorship and oppression and so forth.MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: And when you see backsliding, and you raise that, that's a very valid concern.We can't tell them how to run their countries. We are – he simply expressed in a speech his view of it, which a lot of people, frankly, share. And I thought he said a lot of things in that speech that needed to be said. And, honestly, I don't know why anybody would be upset about it.People are allowed – you know, you don't have to agree on someone's speech. I happen to agree with a lot of what he said, but you don't have to agree with someone's speech to – to at least appreciate the fact they have a right to say it and that you should listen to it and see whether those criticisms are valid.MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: I assure you, the United States has come under withering criticism on many occasions from many leaders in Europe, and we don't go around throwing temper tantrums about it.MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, he was standing in a country where free speech was weaponized to conduct a genocide.And he met with the head of a political party that has far right views and some historic ties to extreme groups. The context of that was changing the tone of it. And you know that, that the censorship was specifically about the right.SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, I have to disagree with you. No, I have – I have to disagree with you.Free speech was not used to conduct a genocide. The genocide was conducted by an authoritarian Nazi regime that happened to also be genocidal because they hated Jews and they hated minorities and they hated those that they – they had a list of people they hated, but primarily the Jews. There was no free speech in Nazi Germany. There was none.There was also no opposition in Nazi Germany. They were a sole and only party that governed that country. So that's not an accurate reflection of history.I also think it's wrong – again, I go back to the point of his speech. The point of his speech was basically that there is an erosion in free speech and intolerance for opposing points of view within Europe, and that's of concern, because that is eroding. That's not an erosion of your military capabilities. That's not an erosion of your economic standing.That's an erosion of the actual values that bind us together in this transatlantic union that everybody talks about. And I think allies and friends and partners that have worked together now for 80 years should be able to speak frankly to one another in open forums without being offended, insulted, or upset.And I spoke to Foreign Ministers from multiple countries throughout Europe. Many of them probably didn't like the speech or didn't agree with it, but they were continuing to engage with us on all sorts of issues that unite us.So, again, at the end of the day, I think that, you know, people give all - - that is a forum in which you're supposed to be inviting people to give speeches, not basically a chorus where everyone is saying the exact same thing. That's not always going to be the case when it's a collection of democracies where leaders have the right and the privilege to speak their minds in forums such as these.MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. Secretary, I'm told that we are out of time. A lot to get through with you. We appreciate you making time today.SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Yes.MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be back in a minute.(ANNOUNCEMENTS)MARGARET BRENNAN: We want to turn now to the economy and inflation, which, compared to last January, ticked up about 3 percent last week.Kevin Hassett is the director of the National Economic Council, and he joins us now. Good morning to you, Director.KEVIN HASSETT (Director, National Economic Council): Good morning, Margaret. Good morning.MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I don't have to tell you, but the rest of the country saw their egg prices at the grocery store go up. We're now at a record high due to that bird flu outbreak, but also labor costs, and that's contributing to food costs overall.When will the administration get that outbreak under control?KEVIN HASSETT: Right.Well, what's going on, right, as you know, is that there is an inflation problem that's very large. We saw the Consumer Price Index come out, and we found out that the stagflation that was created by the policies of President Biden was way worse than we thought.Over the last three months, across all goods, including eggs, the average inflation rate was 4.6 percent, way above target, and an acceleration at the end of the Biden term.And, you know, this is really not just us. You could go look at Jason Furman, Larry Summers, economic advisers of President Biden kept saying, don't do this. You're going to cause massive inflation. In fact, Jason Furman has a very thought-provoking peace in \"Foreign Affairs\" right now calling the Biden economic record a tragedy.And this is them, not us, right? It's – so, now we've got a lot of things that we're doing to get ahold of it.MARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking about fiscal spending there.KEVIN HASSETT: Excuse me. Yes, that's right.MARGARET BRENNAN: You were talking about fiscal spending there. But…KEVIN HASSETT: Well, where does inflation come from, right? And so what we're doing now is, we've – we've got, really, a multi-multi-faceted plan to end inflation.And I will go quickly, because I want to end with what we're doing with egg prices. But we're going to have a macroeconomic change that has supply-side tax cuts, so we have more supply, and we're going to reduce government spending, both through what DOGE is doing, and through congressional action.And so, therefore, the macroeconomic forces that Jason Furman said were a tragedy are going to be reversed. That's a good thing. Then we're also going to have a lot of energy production, a lot of deregulation. And then, finally, when needed, we're going to focus on the individual thing-by-thing pieces.And so, for example, you mentioned avian flu. President Biden didn't really have a plan for avian flu. Well, Brooke Rollins and I have been working with all the best people in government, including academics around the country and around the world, to have a plan ready for the president next week on what we're going to do with avian flu.In fact, I was editing the thing with them tomorrow. But – but the final thing – and then I will give it back to you. I promise not to filibuster.(LAUGHTER)KEVIN HASSETT: The question is, like, why did we do this? Why did we do this? That's what everybody's talking about.But the thing that I always start with when I'm looking at what we're doing, what the president wants us to do, is, why did they do that? Why did they do that?MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. Right.KEVIN HASSETT: And – and there are too many times where it feels like nobody thought about that in the press, or maybe…MARGARET BRENNAN: Oh, gosh.KEVIN HASSETT: … the left wing economists. Why did they do that? Why did Biden print so much money and cause so much inflation? Why did he do it?MARGARET BRENNAN: Oh, Kevin.KEVIN HASSETT: That's – that's what I'm thinking about.MARGARET BRENNAN: Kevin, you know, we talked about that on Face the Nation quite a lot. Quite a lot.KEVIN HASSETT: I don't want – mean to criticize you. OK, good for you.MARGARET BRENNAN: No, no, no.KEVIN HASSETT: Yes.MARGARET BRENNAN: So, next week, we'll see the plan on how to get avian flu – how to get bird flu, under…KEVIN HASSETT: I could talk about it right now if you'd like to, yes.MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, sure. What – what is the plan? Are you going to - - what are you going to do?KEVIN HASSETT: Yes, so – so, again, the – the Biden plan was to just, you know, kill chickens. And they spent billions of dollars just randomly killing chickens within a perimeter where they found a sick chicken.And so you go – I just went to the grocery store. I shop for our family, in part because I love to look at prices. And there were no eggs at the store yesterday, just a few. And – and so that happened because they killed all the chickens.And so what we need to do is have better ways, with biosecurity and medication and so on, to make sure that the perimeter doesn't have to kill the chickens, have a better, smarter perimeter. And so having a smart perimeter is what we're working on. And we're finalizing the ideas about how to do that with the best scientists in government.And that's the kind of thing that should have happened a year ago. And if it had, then egg prices would be, you know, a lot better than they are now.MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.KEVIN HASSETT: But the avian flu is a real thing.MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.KEVIN HASSETT: And, by the way, it's spread mostly by ducks and geese. And so think about it. They're killing chickens to stop the spread, but chickens don't really fly. The – the spread is happening from the geese and the ducks.And so why does it make any sense to have a big perimeter of dead chickens, when it's the – the ducks and the geese that are spreading it?MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the Department of Agriculture policy has been to kill those chickens, as you know.KEVIN HASSETT: Right.MARGARET BRENNAN: But we'll watch the details of that.KEVIN HASSETT: Sure.MARGARET BRENNAN: But let's get back to something the president said.Higher interest rates, as you know, are part of that battle against inflation that the Federal Reserve has been waging. But, this past week, the president called for interest rates to be lowered. Why does he think that's going to lower your grocery prices?KEVIN HASSETT: Well, first of all, I – I want to say that I, just this weekend, have arranged to begin once again regular lunches with Jay Powell at the Federal Reserve.And Jay and I have a long and collegial relationship. And I'm going to go over there with him and the other governors. So we're going to talk about our views about what's going on, and listen to his. And that collegiality has been going on for four years when I was here before, and the president very much values that.I think that the – the thing about…MARGARET BRENNAN: But that's not to influence?KEVIN HASSETT: … lower interest rates – no, I'm going to talk about – well, Jay is going to – Jay is an independent person.MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.KEVIN HASSETT: The Fed independence is respected. And – and the point is, the president's opinion is also – can be heard. He's the president of the United States.But here's the thing that I think is interesting, that if we get inflation under control, then that takes the pressure off the Fed. And one way to tell whether markets think, are we getting inflation under control, is to look at longer-term interest rates that the Fed doesn't affect directly.And if you look at it, the 10-year Treasury rate has dropped about 40 basis points…MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.KEVIN HASSETT: … over the last couple of weeks while we announced our plan to control inflation.MARGARET BRENNAN: Well…KEVIN HASSETT: That saved the American people about $40 billion, about $40 billion, just from talking about the stuff that we're about to do.MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.KEVIN HASSETT: That's pretty good.MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but the president's statement contradicts economic policy. As you know…KEVIN HASSETT: No. Inflation – no. Inflation rates are already – I'm saying the interest rates are already lower by 40 basis points. So, Interest rates are lower. The one that matters…MARGARET BRENNAN: You're briefing the president on it. OK.KEVIN HASSETT: … the most for the economy is maybe the 5- or 10- year rate.MARGARET BRENNAN: But on…KEVIN HASSETT: Those the ones that matter the most. And those are down already. So the president's right about that.MARGARET BRENNAN: Before we run out of time, I really want to make sure I get to you on tariffs.KEVIN HASSETT: OK, sure.MARGARET BRENNAN: Because there's concern that that will add to prices.KEVIN HASSETT: Sure.MARGARET BRENNAN: Because they'll be added on to consumers and what they pay.How are these reciprocal tariffs going to work? The president was tweeting he wants to put them on, like, 175 different countries that have a VAT tax, a value-added tax.KEVIN HASSETT: You know, we're talking to leaders of other countries all the time.Last night, into the wee hours of their morning and kind of a late night for me, I was talking to Minister Reynolds from the U.K. about this very matter. But here's the way I would like to think about it, that, right now, U.S. companies are spending – are paying foreign governments about $370 billion a year in tax, and foreign companies are paying the U.S. government about $57 billion in tax.And a lot of it is because of the VAT. But if we didn't have to pay the foreign governments tax, over 10 years, it'd be about $5 trillion of tax that U.S. citizens don't have to pay. That would more than pay for the tax cuts that we're debating right now.And so if we get some of that money back, either through tariffs, or for – obviously, if they reduce the tariffs of that, then that's good for Americans. It's going to put more money in their pockets.MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.KEVIN HASSETT: And – and that's what President Trump is – is trying to do.MARGARET BRENNAN: Kevin Hassett, I would like to have you come back, sit at the table…KEVIN HASSETT: Always.MARGARET BRENNAN: … and talk through this in – in more detail at another time. We have to leave it there for today.KEVIN HASSETT: Thanks. Happy – happy to be here.MARGARET BRENNAN: Take care.A lot more \"Face the Nation\" in a moment.(ANNOUNCEMENTS)MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation with more from that gathering of foreign leaders from Munich.And, here at home, seven federal prosecutors resigned on principle last week. We will tell you why.Stay with us.(ANNOUNCEMENTS)MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.The Munich Security Conference is an annual gathering of heads of state and international security policymakers. It's one of the biggest conferences. And one of the biggest topics this year was the war in Ukraine.We spoke to two lawmakers earlier from Munich, including House Intelligence Committee Republican Dan Crenshaw. We asked him about President Zelenskyy's views regarding what's needed in a potential peace deal.(BEGIN VT)MARGARET BRENNAN: I understand that he has asked not just for continued military support now, but security assurances in the event of a peace deal. What can you tell him about what to expect from America?REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW (R-TX): Well, I just - I just came from a lunch where General Kellogg spoke. He's the special envoy leading this effort to establish peace. And he's very clear that the kind of peace we're talking about is a lasting peace, which, of course, involves security assurances.And part of that process is figuring out exactly what that means. Even the Ukrainians are talking about what that means. There's a variety of options, per se.I think the Europeans have to play a huge role in that. One of the things that gets talked about a lot is where do - European forces actually acting as a peacekeeping force.The Ukrainians clearly have a seat at the table and then the United States will be the intermediary as we try to establish a peace deal.But the Europeans need to demand a seat at the table by being uncomfortably aggressive, which is something they haven't done. You should be threatening things to Putin that actually make you uncomfortable because that's how - that's the only language Putin speaks is power. And when General Kellogg is at that table with Putin, he's only got a finite amount of leverage. And there's only so much more leverage that the U.S. can - can impose. And if anybody can do it, I think it's Donald Trump. And he's already - he's already said that, that nothing is off the table. Vice President Vance said that, nothing is off the table, economic, military. They will use the amount of leverage they can.My message to European leaders is, if we want to win, if we want a better outcome for Ukraine at the end of these peace talks, you need to be uncomfortably aggressive. You need to, not just bolster your own defense spending, I mean because that's a long-term issue, that's a long-term investment -MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: You need to be talking about where you're going to be putting actual troops on the ground. Stop following our lead and actually take the lead. Let us be actually holding you back. That would be an ideal situation and vastly change the power dynamic when dealing with Putin.MARGARET BRENNAN: There already is a military security alliance known as NATO. You are saying you think there should be something else or some other entity providing security assurances for Ukraine?REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: European soldiers. I mean, look, Europeans send aid, right? They send weapons. They do the same things we do. They - they - they match it, barely. My argument to them is you shouldn't be matching it, you should be doubling it. You should be tripling it. It's your continent.Zelenskyy had a - gave a speech today. He talked about a European army, right? So, there's - there's a lot of talk about this. Of course, there's NATO. That's - that's a security - that's a - that's a defensive alliance.MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: That's - that's - that's some - that's not an army. That's - they did this - we're talking about different things here.The Europeans need to come together, in my opinion, and have just a much stronger message towards Putin instead of finger wagging at us about what we're willing to give or not give in a peace deal.Again, I tell them, look, if you want a seat at the table, earn it. The Ukrainians have earned it. The Ukrainians have impressed everybody for the last three years. They've fought valiantly and courageously. They've earned my respect. They earned that seat at the table. We need to listen to their - to what they want. We listened to Zelenskyy.MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. You said that both President Trump and Vice President Vance were clear, nothing is off the table. However, the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, did seem, in Brussels, to take things quite explicitly off the table. He said the U.S. does not want Ukraine in NATO and that Ukraine would not return to its pre-2014 borders, which acknowledges giving up some of Crimea and potentially the east.Do you think offering concessions before negotiations begin is a good strategy here?REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: Yes, the - I think you have to listen to the White House as a whole. They walked - they walked those back and -MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: And - and made it clear that nothing is off the - nothing is off the table. So, no, you walk into a negotiation with everything on the table and I think that's exactly what this White House is doing.MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: It's less than a month since this administration has been in power and they want to move fast. And everybody's a little nervous. But I think they should be much more optimistic than they should be nervous.You needed a seismic shift here. This was not a sustainable operation in Ukraine. If Kamala Harris had been president, you'd be going along the same lines, which is basically funding this war until every Ukrainian is dead. That's not an end that we can accept.MARGARET BRENNAN: So -REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: There has to be some talk of negotiation. And I'll remind the American people, too, from our perspective, from American strategic deterrent's perspective, even getting Putin to that table to talk about an end to the war is -MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: Is a massive strategic win for us because it establishes back our deterrents over time.MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, do you know that he is actually committing to come to the table? We don't have a commitment to actually negotiate from Vladimir Putin.REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: No, we don't.MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: You know what would be really helpful? What I said before, if the EU was uncomfortably aggressive about it.MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Got it.REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: Again, Putin only responds to power. And this is - this is what I remind western leaders here, too. Western - westerners don't speak that language. Westerns talk about negotiations and, you know, and good moral values that we share and we believe each other.MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: That's not how the east works. They only respond to power.MARGARET BRENNAN: So, OK, on that point, Vladimir Putin, it sounds like you would agree, is an accused war criminal. He is a dictator. There is a warrant out for his arrest, as you know. He invaded Ukraine. He is clearly a U.S. adversary.But this past week President Trump said he'd love to have Putin back in the G-8, which would make him, again, a peer global leader. President Trump floated inviting him to the U.S. or even visiting Russia himself. Do you think any of that is appropriate?REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: It's more appropriate than not talking to him for the last two years, which is what President Biden did. Who did that help? It hasn't - it hasn't gotten us anywhere.MARGARET BRENNAN: Talking is different than inviting him to the United States.REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: Right. Sure. I mean, you can parse it out however you like. But the reality is, is you're going to have to get him to the table somehow, right? And there's a carrot and a stick approach. Trump can use a lot - can use a lot of leverage. And then the Europeans can use a lot more leverage. But you also have that carrot approach. And Trump is good at that. He's good at flattering people in order to get them to the table. That is what we need. Whether we like it or not, that's what we need.MARGARET BRENNAN: But flattering a very brutal dictator who is pretty cunning, frankly, you really think that's a winning strategy?REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: I mean, he's not that cunning. He's fought a - it was a war that has destroyed his society, killed hundreds of thousands of Russians. He's made a massive mistake and miscalculation. He's not - he's not as clever as maybe we are giving him credit for.I think let Trump do his campaign promise and play this out. Look, nobody is going to take advantage of Donald Trump. And General Kellogg made that very clear because that was a question Europeans asked him, you know, are we - are you going to sell out just to get a deal, just to get a deal because of the campaign promise. Kellogg just laughed at that. He's like, there is no way. There is absolutely no way that Donald Trump will be seen - he will not let himself go down in history as having sold out to Putin. He will not let that happen. He believes - just for the sake of his own legacy.MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: But he does care about lasting peace here and lasting European peace.MARGARET BRENNAN: But I think you know some of the things Europeans point to is the fact that the United States cut out our allied government in Afghanistan from the negotiation Donald Trump cut with the Taliban. They point back to that and say, don't do this again.REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: Sure. And I criticized that decision, too.MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: But that's just not what's happening now. This is a vastly different situation. I mean Europeans have all sorts of opinions. The Ukrainians, I think, are very optimistic, as they should be. We've had some very good conversations. Some very realistic conversations. And I'm very excite and optimistic about what can happen here.MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman Crenshaw, thank you for joining us.REPRESENTATIVE DAN CRENSHAW: Thanks for having me.(END VT)MARGARET BRENNAN: Coming up next, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Jeanne Shaheen.Stay with us.(ANNOUNCEMENTS)MARGARET BRENNAN: We also spoke with New Hampshire Democrat Jeanne Shaheen while she was in Munich, focusing on the negotiations to end the war in Ukraine, as well as bipartisan efforts in the Senate to help Ukraine.(BEGIN VT)MARGARET BRENNAN: In terms of negotiations, there were some comments made by President Trump this week. The defense secretary said returning to Ukraine's pre-2014 borders is unrealistic. He's suggesting that maybe the east and another part of Ukraine and Crimea will be taken by Russia. Why do you think there was this plan to give concessions before talks begin?SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN (D-NH): Well, I think it was a mixed message coming from the administration. On the one hand you heard Secretary Hegseth saying they were going to take NATO off the table, that Ukraine needed to give up territory, and on the other hand you had Vice President Vance saying that everything should be on the table, including the possibility of putting boots on the ground in Ukraine.So, it's a mixed message. I hope that the upshot of that is that we are going to do everything we can to support Ukraine.MARGARET BRENNAN: In terms of what Congress can do, are your hands tied here or are some of your Republican colleagues willing to put something, perhaps, in an upcoming defense bill, for example, that might help Ukraine?SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: Well, I think that's one option. One of the things that we're talking about doing right away is making some statements on the - the repossession of assets by Russia that are held in the United States and in Europe and the importance of having those assets go to Ukraine to help both with the execution of the military conflict, but also to think about rebuilding.Again, there's bipartisan support. There was bipartisan support for the bill and there's bipartisan support to continue to try and ensure that those assets from Russia get repaid to Ukraine because Russia is really the aggressor here and we need to hold Vladimir Putin accountable.MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, your Republican counterpart, Roger Wicker, he is the chair of the Armed Services Committee, was really sharp in his comments at Munich. He was saying, he was puzzled, he was disturbed by what the defense secretary, a member of his own party, had said about Ukraine. He was very clear that what Vladimir Putin is doing, he said, is absolutely out of Adolf Hitler's playbook. Those are sharp words considering the president of the United States says he wants to meet face-to-face to Vladimir Putin and possibly bring him to the White House.SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: Well, they are sharp words and they are very much justified. Regardless of what President Trump may be doing to try and lay the groundwork for any future negotiations, the fact is there is strong bipartisan support in Congress to help Ukraine in this unfair war that Russia has initiated. And I think Senator Wicker's comments are very important.MARGARET BRENNAN: At the conference you're at, you were able to speak with European leaders. What are they saying to you about their view of America now?SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: Well, we had a chance to meet with representatives from Britain, from Canada, not a European country but also very concerned about Ukraine, with people from the Balkan countries, with President Zelenskyy, obviously. And there is a great deal of concern about the U.S. position on Ukraine.At the panel that we had with President Zelenskyy, we talked about the importance of Europe and the United States acting in concert so that we can hold Putin accountable with sanctions so that we can - so that there is no daylight between the United States and our NATO allies and our European allies. Clearly that's what Vladimir Putin has been trying to do throughout this conflict, and we need to make it clear that that is not going to happen, that we are going to work together, and we are going to support Ukraine.MARGARET BRENNAN: Does Congress need to be any part of approving this deal President Trump says he wants to take possession of some of the critical minerals that Ukraine has inside their territory? He says he wants to use that as sort of repayment for what the U.S. has spent on weapons.SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: Well, I think there are some benefits to having the United States have some investments in Ukraine. That's part of what a critical minerals deal would do. It's not at all clear who - who has possession of those critical minerals. Some of them are in the eastern part of Ukraine where Russia controls the territory. Some of them are owned by private - actually oligarchs. There are several oligarchs who own a number of those critical mineral sites. So, I think those are details that have not yet been worked out and I have not seen the agreement that's been put in front of President Zelenskyy.MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we know Zelenskyy will be discussing that with other members of the administration. We'll stay tuned on that. But I do want to bring up something that we -SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: He -MARGARET BRENNAN: Sorry. Go ahead.SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: One of the things that, in our conversations with President Zelenskyy, President Zelenskyy reiterated nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine. And I - he got reassurances from the bipartisan senators that he met with that we agree Ukraine absolutely must be part of any negotiations between Russia and the United States.MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Shaheen, thank you for your time today.SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: Thank you.(END VT)MARGARET BRENNAN: Both of our full interviews with Congressman Crenshaw and Senator Shaheen are on cbsnews.com and our YouTube channel.We'll be back in a moment.(ANNOUNCEMENTS)MARGARET BRENNAN: Last week seven federal prosecutors resigned in objection after the Justice Department directed them to drop the investigation into New York City Mayor Eric Adams, who is facing charges, including bribery and conspiracy. In her resignation letter, Danielle Sassoon, the acting U.S. attorney overseeing the case, said a dismissal amounted to a quid pro quo and that the DOJ, quote, \"proposes dismissing the charges against Adams in return for his assistance in enforcing the federal immigration laws.\"In response, then Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove threatened her with an investigation into her conduct.Joining us now is Maryland Democrat Jamie Raskin. He's the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee.This episode is highly unusual. Is there anything that you, in your role, can do about this episode and what's happening inside Attorney General Bondi's Justice Department?REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD): Well, the Justice Department is at war with its own attorneys, its own prosecutors. And the whole episode is just saturated with corruption. It was a corruption prosecution and investigation, which led to a grand jury indictment against Eric Adams for bribery, conspiracy, other corruption charges. And then the new Department of Justice decided to squash the whole thing, basically saying to Adams, well, we will drop this case against you if you engage in certain kinds of political or policy accommodations with us.And then, in order to complete that deeply corrupt bargain, they had to try to coerce their own lawyers to do it. But, of course, the prosecutors were saying, nothing has changed in the facts of the case and nothing has changed in the law. In fact, additional evidence was found, meaning that they were going to revise and expand the original indictment, but instead they were told to kill it for political reasons.And so, you know, this is an outrageous violation of the rules of prosecutors and an offense against due process in a very dangerous first move for the Department of Justice to be making under the Trump people.MARGARET BRENNAN: Mayor Adams, of course, claims there was no quid pro quo and that none of this was wrong, but there was the lead prosecutor, as well, on this case who resigned in objection to what's happening. But it's moving forward here. This is all now in the hands of a judge. Does he have leeway to prosecute?REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: So, first of all, just about Danielle Sassoon. I mean that's a very conservative U.S. attorney, and she couldn't take it. I mean you have the most conservative prosecutors in the country resigning in opposition to this steam roller on behalf of corruption. But it's not over yet because Judge Dale Ho does not have to accept the withdrawal of the charges, the dismissal of the charges, which seven Department of Justice attorneys resigned rather than be involved in. The head of the public integrity section, the head of the criminal division, five other lawyers said, no way, and they wrote very stinging rebukes of the attorney general and the Department of Justice in this case.So, Judge Ho has to accept this dismissal, but he may not. He may go ahead and try to appoint another prosecutor to go ahead and, you know, go through with the indictment that was handed down by a grand jury.MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Attorney General Bondi says there's nothing wrong here, saying it was President Biden's weaponized DOJ that went after Adams for political reasons, and only after he criticized President Biden's immigration policies.This is a fellow Democrat. Do you think he should be prosecuted? And how do you respond to that allegation?REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: Well, first of all, the attorney general did not cite any changes in the facts of the case. She did not cite any changes in the law, because neither occurred, nor did she cite any irregularities in the investigation or the prosecution.MARGARET BRENNAN: She's saying it's all made up.REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: Well, then she's - she's mimicking her boss then, who just lies as a matter of course. One would expect more from the attorney general of the United States.And, you know, this whole corruption attack that is an attack on the Department of Justice for engaging in corruption prosecutions could be impeachable in a different political environment. But the fact that Mayor Adams is a Democrat is neither here nor there for me. I'm against corruption across the board. It seems like Donald Trump wants to attract all of the corrupt politicians in America to his side.MARGARET BRENNAN: So in the Oval Office President Trump - you may have seen this image - he has hung a picture, a framed picture of the front page of \"The New York Post,\" that has his mugshot in it from that criminal case in New York. Yesterday he also tweeted, \"he who saves his country does not violate any law.\"He seems to believe that all those prosecutions against him were politically motivated and voters apparently didn't think it mattered. He was elected with a mandate. How do you convince the public that it does matter?REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: The dominant objective of this administration is corruption and lawlessness. The first thing that they did was they sacked 17 inspectors general. Those are the people who are actual corruption fighters within the departments and agencies. These are the people who ferreted out $91 billion worth of waste, fraud and abuse in the government.MARGARET BRENNAN: They argue it's within their political power to do so.REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: Oh, it - there's no doubt it is, but they sacked them. Actually, it's not within their political power to do so in a lawless way. They have to notify Congress first, 30 days in advance, and they have to set forth the specific reasons for why an inspector general is being fired. They never did that.And the reason, of course, is because they want to pursue agendas of corruption across the board. They're saying they're not going to enforce the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. They are shutting down the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which has saved American consumers $31 million in bank overdraft charges, credit card late fees from corporations completely inflated and having nothing to do with the actual charges and so on. They're getting rid of anything in the government that supports consumers, that supports citizens against the rip-off artists who are their friends.MARGARET BRENNAN: And there's little Democrats can do to push back because you don't have any political power.REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: Well, we're winning in court. More than a dozen federal injunctions and temporary restraining orders have been issued against everything from their illegal seizure of computer data and every Americans' private data at the Treasury Department.MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: To their illegal attempt to ban birthright citizenship in America.MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. We'll see the -REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: We're winning across the board. We are a country based on law.MARGARET BRENNAN: We will watch what happens in those court decisions.Thank you, Congressman Raskin.We'll be right back.REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: You bet.(ANNOUNCEMENTS)MARGARET BRENNAN: We have some happy news to report. After almost 500 days in captivity, American Israeli Segui Dekel-Chen was released yesterday, along with two other Israeli hostages.

With former President Joe Biden choosing to bow out of the 2024 race late in the cycle, and Vice President Kamala Harris failing to defeat President Donald Trump in November, the Democrats have been left without a clear leader moving forward.Although the 2028 election is a little under four years away, pollsters are already fielding surveys to get a glimpse of what Democratic voters are thinking about the future. The polling shows a few prominent Democrats taking an early lead.What to KnowSeveral 2028 Democratic primary polls have been carried out since the 2024 election. All of these polls have consistently shown Harris as the frontrunner. Below her, there are several other prominent Democrats that are consistently polling at the top of the pack.While none of these Democrats have yet announced a 2028 campaign, the polls provide a glimpse of what voters are thinking at this early stage. Here's a closer look at the data.Kamala HarrisHarris' future plans are not clear but there is significant speculation that she will run to be California's next governor in 2026, as the state's current Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom is term limited. Polling has suggested she'd be the frontrunner if she throws her hat in the ring for that race.The most recent poll looking at the 2028 Democratic primary was carried out by Echelon Insights from February 10 to 13, with 443 likely voters. The survey showed Harris as the top choice, with 36 percent support.A previous poll by J.L. Partners for the Daily Mail showed Harris at 30 percent. That survey was conducted from February 2 to 3 and included 500 registered voters. Meanwhile, a poll by McLaughlin & Associates, carried out in late January among 414 likely voters, had Harris at 35 percent.Pete ButtigiegFormer Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg has come in as a distant second in all of the most recent polls. Echelon Insights had the former South Bend, Indiana, mayor at 10 percent, with J.L. Partners and McLaughlin & Associates showing him at 8 percent and 9 percent, respectively.Notably, Buttigieg ran a strong 2020 primary campaign, narrowly finishing first in the Iowa caucuses and tying in the New Hampshire primary. He eventually dropped out following the South Carolina primary, which Biden won handily. Buttigieg endorsed Biden and went on to serve in his Cabinet from 2020 through the end of his term.Gavin NewsomCalifornia's governor is close behind, or tied, with Buttigieg in the recent polling. Echelon Insights shows Newsom at 6 percent, behind the former transportation secretary. In the J.L. Partners survey the two are tied at 8 percent, and in the McLaughlin & Associates poll Newsom comes in third at 7 percent.Alexandria Ocasio-CortezProgressive Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez also appears to be among the top contenders for 2028. The New York Democrat is at 5 percent in the polls by Echelon Insights and J.L. Partners. She came in at 6 percent in the McLaughlin & Associates survey.Other Potential CandidatesThe surveys include a wide range of potential candidates. Two other names that routinely poll higher than others are Governor Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, who was a frontrunner to become Harris' running mate, and Governor Tim Walz of Minnesota, who Harris selected to be on her ticket.There are also some unique contenders who have appeared in recent polls. These include billionaire Mark Cuban, who is at 3 percent in the Echelon Insights poll, and ESPN commentator Stephen A. Smith, who came in at 2 percent in the McLaughlin & Associates survey.What People Are SayingBrian Brokaw, who managed Harris' campaign for California attorney general, recently told Politico: \"I would pretty much guarantee you she [Harris] has no idea what her next move is. She is not someone who makes rash decisions. She takes, sometimes, a painfully long time to make decisions. Could she run for governor? Yes. Do I think she wants to run for governor? Probably not. Could she win? Definitely. Would she like the job? I don't know. Could she run for president again? Yes.\"Monica Crowley, a former official in Trump's first administration, told Fox News in late November: \"Just a word of warning to the Republicans, to my party, do not underestimate AOC, she's young, she's vibrant, she's attractive. I think she's wrong on everything, but she does have real grass root support. And all the energy and activism in the Democrat party remains with the revolutionary left, of which she is a part.\"Stephen A. Smith told CNBC last week: \"I wouldn't mind being in office, but running for it is a problem. I'm not one of those dudes that's great at shaking hands and kissing babies, per se, and currying favor with politicians and donors. I'm not a beggar. That's not who I am. Now, if you told me I could bypass all of that, and I could go up on that stage on national television, for a presidential debate, and go up against some of the people that I've seen, you name the time and place and I'll show up.Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to Latino USA: \"I have a weird relationship with the Democratic Party. I don't believe in a two-party system, but I also understand the Democratic Party is a coalition and if we want the party to change, the balance of the coalition has to change. But right now, you open the hood on the Democratic Party, what you have is, I think, a bit of a power struggle over the last couple of years.\"What Happens Next?It's unclear which Democrats will ultimately throw their hats into the ring to run in the 2028 primary. These decisions usually aren't officially announced until later, likely after the 2026 midterm elections or in early 2027.While there are a number of prominent figures being floated at this stage, it's possible that a candidate not currently on anyone's radar will emerge and ultimately come out on top.","summary":"The election may be over three years away, but there's already a steady trickle of polls on potential candidates.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/democrats-2028-primary-polls-what-early-data-shows-2031820","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2589359/2028-democratic-candidates.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-16 17:48:29","author":"Jason Lemon","authors":["Jason Lemon"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.167},{"id":291138382,"title":"Ellen DeGeneres to Sophie Turner — 7 Famous Celebrities Don’t Want to Live in Donald Trump’s America","text":"After President-elect Donald Trump defeated Vice-President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election many celebrities have voiced their discontent and even made their plans to flee the United States.\n\nTwo of these celebrities have already left for England, and others may not be staying for a second Trump term.\n\n1.

Oliver just hit me,” the suit reads.\n\nHer mother and friend then listened in horror as Lane returned to the room and allegedly “violently slapped her across the face at full strength multiple times,” told her she was a “little child” and said he wanted to kill her, the suit continues.\n\nThe friend called 911 and police arrived to find Hubert-Ross “battered, bruised and bleeding,” according to the suit, which includes photos of extensive bruising on her body.\n\nLane was arrested and charged with felony strangulation and misdemeanor assault, according to court records obtained by The Post. \n\nHours later, Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg’s office told a judge that the case was strong and that the alleged beating was extremely violent, according to a law enforcement source.\n\nBut Bragg’s office changed its tune months later. \n\nDuring a tense December meeting at the DA’s office, prosecutors told Hubert-Ross the prosecution would not be moving forward, she said.\n\nLane, who had faced up to seven years in prison if convicted of the charges, would now get off scot-free under the terms of his deal if he went to therapy and agreed to a restraining order, Hubert-Ross said she learned.\n\n“I felt betrayed and re-victimized for myself and others,” said the comedian, actress and model, who boasts 375,000 followers on Instagram.\n\nProsecutors felt forced to drop the felony strangulation charge because the case lacked sufficient evidence of specific physical injuries to the neck, or that Hubert-Ross lost consciousness, a DA’s office spokesperson said.\n\nThe office did not explain why it chose not to keep prosecuting the case as a misdemeanor assault.\n\nInstead, Lane was allowed to plead guilty to making “unreasonable noise” on the condition that he go to therapy 16 times and stay away from Hubert-Ross until December 2026, court records show.\n\nThe lenient deal means that Lane is now subject to the same level of punishment as if he’d been ticketed for speeding, or parking in a handicapped space.\n\nThe deal also covers his second arrest, for allegedly breaching a restraining order by texting Hubert-Ross “please don’t call the police” the day after the reported assault — and then brazenly threatening to call the cops on her, the records say.\n\n“Please talk to me. I’m begging you. I don’t want to have to go to the police tomorrow and report all of the damage,” Lane texted, according to a criminal complaint.\n\nWhen Hubert-Ross protested the lax deal during the December meeting, prosecutors offered her a shocking partial explanation, she recalled.\n\nAmong their worries about the case was that her social media posts, which include jokes about sex, could be used to attack her credibility at a trial, she said.\n\n“I was shocked to hear that my job as a comedian would be held against me,” Hubert-Ross said, speaking alongside Brett Gallaway, her lawyer in the ongoing Manhattan civil suit, which was filed in September.\n\n“Nothing about this assault was funny,” she added.\n\nProsecutors also seemed to sympathize with Lane’s immigration status — noting that the man accused of brutally beating her could be deported if he was convicted of a serious crime, she said.\n\nThe DA’s office did not dispute Hubert-Ross’ account of the meeting, but stressed that it does not decide whether to prosecute cases based on social media posts unrelated to alleged crimes.\n\n“In intimate-partner violence cases, we prioritize both the safety of the survivor and the safety of the community,” the spokesperson said. “Following a full investigation by our office, this resolution ensured accountability for the defendant with mandated therapy and, critically, a two-year order of protection in favor of the victim.”\n\nGallaway, of the firm McLaughlin & Stern, said he is now investigating why Bragg’s office offered Lane the deal despite being confident in the case at first.\n\n“We are surprised and concerned that when presented with such clear and overwhelming evidence… that the DA’s office would be so quick to plea Mr. Lane down to a violation that is effectively the equivalent of a traffic ticket,” Gallaway told The Post.\n\n“This is someone who allegedly beat his defenseless and frightened girlfriend to a pulp,” the lawyer added. “He did not run a red light.” \n\nProsecutors’ purported claim that Hubert-Ross’s sexually charged online posts impacted the case is such “horrific and backwards” logic, he said, suggesting that it might be a cover story to hide something else that transpired behind the scenes.\n\n“A person’s profession has no bearing on their status as a victim,” he said, calling such a suggestion “the equivalent defense of saying a stripper cannot be raped.”\n\nGallaway believes that Lane’s lawyers likely lobbied for prosecutors’ sympathy by sending them a so-called “good-guy packet” — a stack of files that typically includes letters attesting to someone’s character.\n\nSuch letters are commonly sent in criminal cases by lawyers angling for a plea. \n\nBut Lane’s case file for his arrest is now sealed, leaving Hubert-Ross’ lawyers in the dark on whether such records exist, Gallaway said.\n\nHubert-Ross’ lawyers have filed a Freedom of Information request with Bragg’s office in a bid to force them to turn over any relevant files that could explain why Lane got such a favorable deal. \n\nSo far, the DA’s office has been stonewalling them, griping that it can’t turn over such documents because the case file is sealed, according to a letter viewed by The Post.\n\nGallaway said that he’s puzzled by why prosecutors so quickly tossed Lane’s charges despite having more witnesses than in a typical domestic violence case, which normally involves just the accuser and the alleged attacker. \n\nIn this case, Hubert-Ross had put her mother and friend on speakerphone during the alleged beating, the lawyer noted.\n\nGallaway added that based on his own investigation, law enforcement never interviewed a neighbor who was woken up by the late-night “loud and violent” encounter.\n\nLane’s father, Jonathan Lane, is a “non-executive chair” at Grosvenor, a company that runs the roughly $9 billion estate of Hugh Grosvenor, known as the Duke of Westminster.\n\nThe 34-year-old Duke is the Godson of King Charles III, a close friend of Prince William, and one of the most wealthy men in Britain. Lane’s father is not accused of any wrongdoing.\n\nHubert-Ross, whose mother is black and who in her comedy speaks often about her mixed-race background, called Lane’s deal “an example of rich white privilege taking priority over clear accountability.”\n\nLane’s lawyer in his criminal case, Scott Migden, declined to comment. \n\nThe accused attacker’s attorney in his civil case, Mitch Schuster, has touted the DA office’s decision to toss Lane’s charges in his bid to get the lawsuit tossed.\n\n“Notwithstanding plaintiff’s hyperbolic cries of ‘choking’, ‘suffocation’, ‘attempted murder’ and the like, the manner in which DANY and criminal court elected to dispose of the criminal charges against Lane speaks for itself,” Schuster wrote in a Jan.8 legal filing.\n\nSchuster said he couldn’t comment when reached by The Post.","summary":"The son of a British banking bigwig was allowed to take a forgiving plea deal after he was charged with beating and strangling his up-and-coming comedian girlfriend in Manhattan, The Post has learned.

Edgar Hoover?","text":"Kash Patel, Donald Trump’s nominee for FBI chief, has said he wants to dismantle the J. Edgar Hoover Building, the agency’s concrete fortress headquarters in Washington, and disperse the 7,000 employees who work there to offices around the country. \n\nPatel could well succeed in demolishing the landmark building named for the FBI’s founding director. It was opened in 1974 and is now considered obsolescent; a replacement site in Maryland has already been chosen. But many of the incoming director’s critics worry that Patel worry he may return to the practices of the Hoover era, including unauthorized surveillance operations, massive collection of personal data and harassment of dissidents, activists and perceived political enemies.\n\nHoover served as FBI director from 1924 to 1972 — the first 11 years at its predecessor organization, the Bureau of Investigation — and built the agency from a small and obscure department of the federal government to the fearsome, sprawling security force of today. Currently, the FBI has a budget of $10 billion and employs 33,000 workers, including 13,000 special agents and 20,000 support personnel. \n\nHoover became a national hero in the 1930s and ‘40s, when the FBI captured notorious criminals like John Dillinger, Pretty Boy Floyd and Machine Gun Kelly, and rounded up dozens of Nazi spies during World War II. \n\nBut his legacy is quite different today. Most historians now regard Hoover as a racist and a misogynist. He belonged to an openly white supremacist fraternity as a law student at George Washington University; it is perhaps no accident that the FBI remained 99% white and all male until Hoover’s death in 1972. He fiercely guarded his autonomy, serving under seven presidents, none of whom dared fire him — perhaps because they feared what was in his voluminous files. He compiled enormous troves of information on senators, members of Congress and other public figures, and curried favor with Franklin D. Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson, among others, by sharing gossip about their political rivals. On occasion, he conducted secret wiretapping or surveillance for his bosses.\n\nAlthough Hoover officially lived on a modest salary in a small home in Washington, not far from where he was born and raised, he supplemented his income with speaking fees, gifts from admirers and free travel. An enthusiastic gambler on horse races, he was rumored to have obtained inside tips from track officials, perhaps one reason he was considered to be “soft” on pursuing organized crime. \n\nIn the 1950s, he targeted the Communist Party USA for special scrutiny, and by the end of that decade, an estimated 1,500 of the party’s 10,000 or so members were FBI informants. Historians estimate that the FBI bureau compiled files on 10 million Americans; of those, 20,000 were considered “subversive” and subject to detention in an emergency. After the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950, Hoover offered to round up as many as 10,000 individuals immediately; President Harry Truman was horrified and rejected the idea. \n\nHoover’s racism and anti-communist paranoia resulted in his notorious vendetta against Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Hoover could not believe that Black people, whom he considered inferior and submissive by nature, would rise up and challenge the oppression they endured in the segregated South. He was convinced that the Soviet Union was orchestrating the civil rights movement and that King was a communist agent. Obsessed with destroying King’s reputation, Hoover ordered the wiretapping of King’s home and hotel rooms, collecting reels of tape documenting the leader’s extramarital affairs. His agents routinely mailed and telephoned death threats to King. Shortly before King’s assassination in 1968, the FBI sent a package to his wife, Coretta Scott King, containing tape recordings of his sexual escapades. \n\nHoover kept this and other illegal actions secret, and his reputation remained largely intact until the legendary 1975 hearings held by Sen. Frank Church, an Idaho Democrat. Held in the immediate aftermath of the Watergate scandal and Richard Nixon’s resignation, the Church committee hearings uncovered many rogue activities of the FBI and CIA. Among its most spectacular and alarming findings were the CIA’s many assassination attempts against Cuban leader Fidel Castro. \n\nAfter the Church hearings, Attorney General Edward Levi published a new and far stricter set of guidelines for the FBI. Later FBI directors, including William Webster and Robert Mueller, have reportedly followed them closely. James Comey, the FBI director fired by Trump in 2017, kept in his office a framed FBI letter requesting a wiretap on Dr. King. He called it a “reminder of the bureau's capacity to do wrong.\" \n\nWant a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer? Subscribe to our morning newsletter, Crash Course.\n\nIn an interview with The New York Times, Yale professor Beverly Gage, author of the acclaimed 2023 Hoover biography \"G-Man,\" said the founding director would have been \"appalled\" at Trump’s nomination of Kash Patel. Gage said she found the most frightening aspect to be Patel’s sycophancy to Trump. \"He’s making no secret that he will use the bureau to punish Mr. Trump’s enemies,\" Gage said.\n\nThe obvious question here is how far Patel is willing to go. Will he ignore agency guidelines and seek to persecute citizens that Trump considers enemies?\n\nIn 2023 Patel published a book entitled \"Government Gangsters,\" in which he labeled the FBI \"a tool of surveillance and suppression of American citizens\" and \"one of the most cunning and powerful arms of the Deep State.\" The so-called deep state, he continued, was \"a dangerous threat to democracy\" which used the FBI to target and persecute conservatives. At the end of the book, Patel included an appendix naming 50 current or former U.S. officials he labeled as \"members of the Executive Branch deep state.\" That list included Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Hillary Clinton, Bill Barr, John Bolton, Christopher Wray, James Comey and Gen. Mark Milley. \n\nIn his first confirmation hearing on Jan. 30, Patel denied that the roster of names was an enemies list, describing it as \"just a glossary.\"\n\n\"I have no interest, no desire, and will not, if confirmed, go backward,\" Patel told the senators. \"There will be no politicization at the FBI. There will be no retributive actions taken by any FBI.\"\n\nRep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, was not convinced. He called Patel \"a dangerous choice\" with \"a wavering commitment to the rule of law,\" who appeared ready to \"silence dissent.\"\n\nUnder current law, the FBI director reports to the attorney general, the recently confirmed Pam Bondi. She would be in a position to potentially limit a new director’s activities. \n\nIf Patel does indeed conduct covert surveillance on innocent American citizens and persecute individuals he perceives as Donald Trump’s enemies, he will (consciously or otherwise) be emulating J. Edgar Hoover. If he follows the U.S. Constitution and sticks to FBI guidelines, then the dark days of Hoover’s secretive, vengeful reign will remain in the past.","summary":"Trump's FBI pick could be a throwback to America's legendary secret policeman, who ran the FBI for nearly 50 years","url":"https://www.salon.com/2025/02/16/will-kash-patel-turn-out-to-be-the-next-j-edgar-hoover/","image":"https://mediaproxy.salon.com/width/1200/height/675/<?= https://media2.salon.com/2025/02/jedgarhoover-515536008.jpg ?>","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-16 16:00:05","author":"James Thornton Harris","authors":["James Thornton Harris"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.148},{"id":291120294,"title":"Transcript: Rep.

Dan Crenshaw of Texas that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Feb. 16, 2025.MARGARET BRENNAN: And we go now to Republican Congressman Dan Crenshaw of Texas, who joins us from the Munich Security Conference. Congressman, thank you for joining us. You recently met with President Zelenskyy of Ukraine, along with a bipartisan group of lawmakers. I understand that he has asked, not just for continued military support now, but security assurances in the event of a peace deal. What can you tell him about what to expect from America?REP. DAN CRENSHAW: I just- I just came from a lunch where General Kellogg spoke as a Special Envoy leading this effort to establish peace. And he's very clear that what the kind of peace we're talking about is a lasting peace, which, of course, involves security assurances. And part of that process is figuring out exactly what that means. Even the Ukrainians are talking about what that means. There's a variety of options, per se. I think the Europeans have to play a huge role in that. One of the things that gets talked about a lot is, what are European forces actually acting as a peacekeeping force? I'm here to constantly remind the Europeans, and I made this clear in various meetings here today, that, you know, if you want a seat at the table, because this is- this was a contentious issue that came up. You know, the Ukrainians clearly have a seat at the table, and the United States will be the intermediate- intermediary as we try to establish a peace deal. But the Europeans need to demand a seat at the table by- by being uncomfortably aggressive, which is something they haven't done. They often talk-- MARGARET BRENNAN: -- What do you mean? -- REP. DAN CRENSHAW: -- about how they have matched U.S.- I'm telling you what I mean. They often talk about how they've matched U.S. aid, for instance. And I say, well, you should be doubling it. You should be tripling it. It's your continent. You should be threatening things to Putin that actually make you uncomfortable, because that's how- that's the only language Putin speaks is power. And when General Kellogg is at that table with Putin, he's only got a finite amount of leverage, and there's only so much more leverage that the U.S. can- can impose. And if anybody can do it, I think it's Donald Trump, and he's already- he's already said that, that nothing is off the table. Vice President Vance said that nothing is off the table. Economic, military, they will use the amount of leverage they can. My message to European leaders, I'm really not talking to you right now, I'm talking to European leaders right now, is if we want to win, if we want a better outcome for Ukraine, at the end of these peace talks, you need to be uncomfortably aggressive. You need to not just bolster your own defense spending, I mean because that's a long-term issue. That's a long term investment. You need to be talking about where you're going to be putting actual troops on the ground. Stop following our lead and actually take the lead. Let us be actually holding you back. That would be an ideal situation and- and- and vastly change the power dynamic when dealing with PutinMARGARET BRENNAN: So I just want to understand what you're describing here. There already is a military security alliance known as NATO. You are saying you think there should be something else, or some other entity providing security assurances for Ukraine?REP. CRENSHAW: European soldiers. I mean- look, Europeans send aid, right? They send weapons. They do the same things we do, they match it barely. My argument to them is you shouldn't be matching it. You should be doubling it. You should be tripling it. It's your continent. Zelenskyy had a- gave a speech today. He talked about a European army, right? So there's- there's- there's a lot of talk about this. Of course, there's NATO. That's- that's a security that's- that's a defensive alliance. That's- that's- that's not an army. That's- we're talking about different things here. The Europeans need to come together, in my opinion, and have just a much stronger message towards Putin, instead of finger wagging at us about what we're willing to give and not give in a peace deal. Again, I tell them, look, if you- if you want a seat at the table, earn it. The Ukrainians have earned it. The Ukrainians have impressed everybody for the last three years. They've fought valiantly and courageously. They've earned my respect. They earned that seat at the table. We need to listen to their- to what they want. We listen to Zelenskyy. And I want to listen to other European leaders as well, but I want them to be uncomfortably aggressive, because that gives us more leverage in order to help Ukraine come out with a better outcome.MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. You said that both President Trump and Vice President Vance were clear, nothing is off the table. However, the Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth did seem, in Brussels, to take things quite explicitly off the table. He said the U.S. does not want Ukraine in NATO and that Ukraine would not return to its pre-2014 borders, which acknowledges giving up some of Crimea and potentially the east. Do you think offering concessions before negotiations begin is a good strategy here?REP. CRENSHAW: Yeah, I think you have to listen to the White House as a whole. They walked- they walked those back and made it clear that nothing is off- nothing is off the table. So- no, you walk into a negotiation with everything on the table. And I think that's exactly what this White House is doing and what General Kellogg is, I think, the right guy to do it. And again, I just heard from him speak to a whole group of European leaders. We were there with Ukrainian soldiers, Ukrainian leaders. And look, there's a path forward here. We don't know the details yet, because we barely started. It's less than a month since this administration has been in power, and they want to move fast, and everybody's a little nervous, but I think they should be much more optimistic than they should be nervous. You needed a seismic shift here. This is not a sustainable operation in Ukraine. If Kamala Harris had been president, you'd be going along the same lines, which is basically funding this war until every Ukrainian is dead. That's not an end that we can accept. There has to be some talk of negotiation. You know, I remind American people to from- from our perspective, from- from American strategic deterrence perspective, even getting Putin to that table to talk about an end to the war is a massive strategic win for us, because it establishes back our deterrence over time.MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you know that he is actually committing to come to the table? Secretary of State Rubio said the other day, the Russians haven't even figured out if they have, you know, picked out negotiators. We don't have a commitment to actually negotiate from Vladimir Putin. REP. CRENSHAW: No, we don't. And you know what would be really helpful? What I said before, if the EU was uncomfortably aggressive about it.MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Got it-- REP. CRENSHAW: Again, Putin only responds to power. And this is- this is what I remind Western leaders here to. Western- Westerners don't speak that language. Westerners talk about negotiations and- and, you know- and good moral values that we share and we believe each other. That's not how the East works. They only respond to power.MARGARET BRENNAN: So, okay, on that point, Vladimir Putin, it sounds like you would agree, is an accused war criminal. He is a dictator. There is a warrant out for his arrest, as you know, he invaded Ukraine. He is clearly a U.S. adversary, but this past week, President Trump said he'd love to have Putin back in the G8 which would make him again a peer global leader. President Trump floated inviting him to the U.S. or even visiting Russia himself. Do you think any of that is appropriate? REP. CRENSHAW: It's more appropriate than not talking to him for the last two years, which is what President Biden did. Who did that help? It hasn't gotten us anywhere-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Talking is different than inviting him to the United States.REP. CRENSHAW: Sure. I mean, you can parse it out however you like, but the reality is is you're going to have to get him to the table somehow, right? And there's a carrot and a stick approach. Trump can use a lot- you can use a lot of leverage, and then the Europeans need to use a lot more leverage. But you also have that carrot approach, and Trump is good at that. He's good at flattering people in order to get them to the table. That is what we need, whether we like it or not, that's what we need. That's what Ukraine needs. Ukraine cannot sustain this, no matter how much money we give them, cannot sustain this forever, and so it is in our interest to get him to that table and there's a variety of ways to do it, and I trust the president's at least doing a heck of a lot better job than anybody else. I don't see- I don't hear any other ideas, by the way, so this is what we're going with.MARGARET BRENNAN: But flattering, a very brutal dictator who's pretty cunning, frankly, you really think that's a winning strategy?REP. CRENSHAW: He's not that cunning. He's fought a war that has destroyed his society, killed hundreds of thousands of Russians. He's made a massive mistake and miscalculation. He's not as clever as maybe we've given him credit for. I think, let Trump do his campaign promise and play this out. Look, nobody's going to take advantage of Donald Trump. And General Kellogg made that very clear, because that was a question Europeans asked him, you know, we- are you going to sell out just- just- just to get a deal? Just to get a deal that's because of the campaign promise? Kellogg just laughed at that. He's like, there is no way, there is absolutely no way that Donald Trump will be seen, and he will not let himself go down in history as having sold out to Putin. He will not let that happen. He believes- just for the sake of his own legacy, but he does care about lasting peace here, and lasting European peace. Again, my messaging, I'm not even talking to you right now, I'm talking to European leaders, you have to be uncomfortably aggressive against Putin in order to actually help us make this happen.MARGARET BRENNAN: But I think you know, some of the things Europeans point to is the fact that the United States cut out our allied government in Afghanistan from the negotiation Donald Trump cut with the Taliban. So there is a reason they point back to that and say, don't do this again. Don't cut Ukraine out of a negotiation with an enemy.REP. CRENSHAW: Sure, I mean, and I criticized that decision too, but that's just not what's happening now. This is a vastly different situation. I just met with Zelenskyy last night. They're having very good conversations with our administration. The Ukrainians, I think, are very- the Europeans have all sorts of opinions. The Ukrainians, I think, are very optimistic as they should be. We've had some very good conversations, some very realistic conversations, and I'm very excited and optimistic about what can happen here.MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, just because I raised Afghanistan to you, I want to ask you, you were one of the co-sponsors of the Afghan Adjustment Act, which was an effort to help bring some of those Afghans who helped the United States in its war in Afghanistan here to the United States for safety reasons. They are now stuck because of this Trump refugee ban. This is not just special immigrant visa holders. These are refugees writ large. Do you think the U.S. should continue to bring those Afghans to the U.S.?REP. CRENSHAW: Yeah, let's actually be really clear. The reason they're stuck is because Joe Biden pulled out of Afghanistan and had a zero troop policy despite every adviser telling him it was a terrible idea. That's why they're stuck. I still support bringing our allies back. I mean, to answer your question, it is obviously still a policy that I support, and we'll work with the administration to make it happen. I mean, look, I was blown up because one of my interpreters stepped on a- on an IED right in front of me. He died. He lost all four limbs. Died later that night. These are- these are patriots. They were fighting for- with us, alongside of us, for their own country, for our interests. Of course, actual allies need to be brought home. I think the unfortunate thing about that withdrawal is a lot of people who are not even our allies made it back on those flights, and then the people who are our allies, including U.S. citizens, were left behind. Again, we cannot blame Donald Trump for this. Donald Trump never left Afghanistan and we can say, well, he wanted to, well, he never did. That's the reality --MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. I'm just asking about the policy now. REP. CRENSHAW--So, we're going to work with the administration on this, and also, Congress still has to pass that. I mean --MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.REP. CRENSHAW--You know it's- there's- it goes beyond the the executive at this moment,MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, when it comes to the military and military spending, the U.S. spends about 3.4 percent of its GDP on defense. Are you on board with boosting it to five percent which is what President Trump is saying western countries need to do? Are Republicans going to do that?REP. CRENSHAW: It's- it's quite the target. Look, we've got a lot of work to do right now on- we've got a budget to pass, last year's budget. Government funding expires on March 14, so we got to deal with that. We got to deal with the debt ceiling. We've got to finance disaster aid for California wildfires. We've got a reconciliation bill coming up. Look, you look at- you look at the world at the moment, and where America stands and the investments we need to make, it's pretty obvious we need to increase defense spending, and the exact amount, of course, will get worked out in Congress.MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman Crenshaw, thank you for joining us.REP. CRENSHAW: Thanks for having me.","summary":"The following is the transcript of an interview with GOP Rep.

The deal was clinched Saturday night, about 48 hours after the previous pact had expired. The two sides then extended a deadline to allow negotiations to continue, keeping nearly two dozen Paramount channels, including CBS Sports, BET, Comedy Central, Nickelodeon, TV Land and Los Angeles broadcast stations KCBS-TV Channel 2 and KCAL-TV Channel 9 available to YouTube TV customers. \"With this agreement, YouTube TV will continue to offer 100+ channels and add-ons including Paramount+ with Showtime and will enable more user choice in the future,\" YouTube said in a statement. \"To our subscribers, we appreciate your patience while we negotiated on your behalf.\" Contract terms were not disclosed. Negotiators spent days haggling over terms and fees that Google would pay for the rights to carry Paramount channels. Neither side appeared eager to let their squabble disrupt viewing for YouTube's subscribers. As part of the agreement, YouTube will begin offering Paramount's streaming services, including BET+ and Paramount+ with Showtime, as an add-on channel on the streaming service. \"We look forward to extending our long-standing partnership and giving audiences greater access to their favorite programming,\" Paramount said in a statement. Clashes between programmers and distributors have become increasingly common amid the fraying of television's economic model. Three years ago, a dispute between Google and the Walt Disney Co. prompted a brief blackout of ESPN and other Disney networks on YouTube TV. Pay-TV providers, including Google, are motivated to control costs to attract and retain fickle subscribers who have an abundance of viewing options. Millions of customers have dropped traditional pay-TV subscriptions in the past decade; many have switched to streaming platforms including YouTube TV and Hulu+ Live TV. At the same time, Paramount and other Hollywood companies are struggling to maintain their revenue streams amid ratings declines and cable customer defections. Programmers are motivated to preserve the lucrative pay-TV distribution fees. YouTube TV has grown into a major player in television, appealing to younger viewers and sports fans. It is the fourth-largest multichannel distributor in the U.S., behind Charter’s Spectrum, Comcast Xfinity and DirecTV, based in El Segundo. YouTube TV took over the NFL’s “Sunday Ticket” subscription offering in 2023 after it became too expensive for longtime rights-holder, DirecTV. However, the nearly $2-billion-a-year bill for Sunday afternoon NFL games has increased the cost of operating YouTube TV, prompting Google to scrutinize other contract expenditures. Last month, YouTube TV raised its charge to customers to $82.99 a month, up from $72.99 a month. Paramount also was eager to avoid a nasty showdown. The media company's controlling shareholder Shari Redstone struck a deal last summer to sell her family's business of four decades to the Larry Ellison family. The plan is for David Ellison's Skydance Media to absorb the larger entertainment company, Paramount, in a deal valued at $8 billion. Executives are racing to complete the transaction by early April. But the Skydance deal has encountered turbulence at the Federal Communications Commission, which must sign off on the transfer of the CBS television licenses to Ellison for the sale to close. The company also is trying to fend off a $20-billion lawsuit filed by President Trump over edits made to a “60 Minutes” interview of former Vice President Kamala Harris last fall. CBS is separately sparring with Sony Pictures Television to retain distribution rights for Sony’s hugely popular game shows “Jeopardy!” and “Wheel of Fortune.”","summary":"The two media companies announced a new deal Saturday night.

Perhaps my favorite of the genre is “The Man in The High Castle,” where the alternative universe is one in which the Nazis triumphed in World War II. It’s a great way to explore ideas and think about history.\n\nAlong those lines, let’s say some weird vortex blows in from the, er, Gulf of America and we suddenly find that instead of losing the election, Kamala Harris won a solid victory. Democrats control both houses of Congress and the Supreme Court has a progressive majority. We also find that the Democratic base has a cult-like commitment to the former vice president and the media are acting like lapdogs. It’s preposterous (except for the media part), but we’re talking science fiction.\n\nInstead of governing in the typical misguided way that every presidential administration has operated in the post-war era, President Harris decides to echo the approach of Real World President Donald Trump and govern by edict. Spare me the “whataboutism.” Yes, I know that all presidents have abused their executive-order authority, have defied the Constitution’s clear words and have used the administrative state to advance some dubious ends.\n\nBut there’s little question that Trump is taking the concept of the imperial presidency to its apogee. The term refers to the vast expansion of presidential authority—and the process whereby a president uses supposed national-security emergencies to justify far-reaching policies that evade the scrutiny of Congress and the courts. Everyone has done it. George W. Bush used the War on Terror to justify everything. Barack Obama used the financial crisis as an excuse.\n\nBut the situation is more perilous in our current dystopian world. First, Trump is more brazen than anyone since FDR in exerting presidential muscle. Second, some in the Trump orbit suggest the courts have no check on the executive branch. Third, the self-appointed defenders of the Constitution (conservatives) no longer are complaining about these power grabs. In the old days (before January 20), they would have publicly decried the actions of elected dictators.\n\nThe separation of powers embodies the essence of our Constitution. “The Framers’ experience with the British monarchy informed their belief that concentrating distinct governmental powers in a single entity would subject the nation’s people to arbitrary and oppressive government action,” explains the official congressional website. Former Chief Justice William Rehnquist rightly said “the creation of an independent constitutional court … is probably the most significant contribution the United States has made to the art of government.”\n\nApparently, this reflects a dying art. While I agree with some of Trump’s stated goals in slashing the federal behemoth, it’s crucial that such efforts—and I do believe most of these current efforts are flashes in the pan or attempts to replace civil servants with MAGA loyalists—follow proper legal procedures. Perhaps Trump’s most blatantly unconstitutional action was his attempted abolition of birthright citizenship. Hint: One cannot change the Constitution by executive order. Fortunately, the courts have so far blocked this dictatorial impulse.\n\nWhat would conservatives say had Alternative Universe President Harris created new agencies by decree? And what if she threatened to defy court oversight? Toward the end of the Biden administration, the former president and Harris foolishly claimed the Equal Rights Amendment was ratified (it wasn’t). People laughed. But if Harris were in charge, wouldn’t conservatives hope for judicial scrutiny?\n\nYet Vice President J.D. Vance argued recently on X: “If a judge tried to tell a general how to conduct a military operation, that would be illegal. If a judge tried to command the attorney general in how to use her discretion as a prosecutor, that’s also illegal. Judges aren’t allowed to control the executive’s legitimate power.” Fortunately, Trump just said that he will abide by court rulings but appeal them, so there is some hope for maintaining judicial review.\n\n puts it more eloquently: “If the president is able to defy or ignore court orders against him, then the executive branch would be effectively free of legal constraints … . It could violate constitutional rights, usurp the authority of Congress (as Trump is trying to do with his wide-ranging assault on the spending power), and more. … (W)e would no longer have a constitutionally constrained federal government, except perhaps in name only.”\n\nOne of my oft-repeated maxims: Never support new government powers that you wouldn’t trust in the hands of your enemies. Perhaps Republicans figure Democrats will never win again – and the president continues to toy with running for a third term – but that seems unlikely. In an alternative world where a Harris or Gavin Newsom were president, would you be comfortable with this kind of imperial presidency?\n\nSteven Greenhut is Western region director for the R Street Institute and a member of the Southern California News Group editorial board.

As it raised eyebrows, a news commentator stated that her refusal was simply because of her unwillingness to “play nice with someone who colluded against her husband.”\n\nThe present US President’s wife allegedly refused to meet in the country’s capital concerning a lingering resentment over a raid on her Mar-a-Lago residence.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by Melania Trump (@melaniatrump) \n\nBy this, the 54-year-old pointed out the August 2022 raid on her family’s Florida home as a reason for not going face-to-face with Jill Biden. Things even worsened when an investigation was initiated by Joe Biden’s Attorney General Merrick Garland, and consequently, 300 classified government documents from Donald Trump’s property were seized. \n\nSeveral reports say Melania had a too-busy schedule at that particular time concerning the release of her memoir, which even featured numerous bombshell admissions.\n\nIn an interview with Sky News Australia, Prue MacSween stated— “The world… knows that Biden was the one who’s been probably orchestrating her lame duck husband for quite a while and she would be… colluding with [Nancy] Pelosi I presume… [in] the ‘gotcha’ moments with Trump to try and get him out of contention.” \n\nShe further stated – “I don’t blame Melania. She’s a strong woman. Why would she put up with playing nice with this woman who’s been colluding against their family?” MacSween also noted: “I was amused to also see that even Kamala didn’t shake Jill’s hand when they appeared at some sort of a ceremony just the other day.”\n\nPrue MacSween also mentioned the first meet-up between Jill Biden and Kamala Harris at the National Cemetery on Monday, November 11, and stirred the pot on their first joint show post-election.

Yeah, some of the members of these organizations can be a bit…much. (Full disclosure, I am a proud member of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Incorporated founded on…never mind. I know we can be annoying. Sorry.) \n\nBut we should give these organizations and their members the flowers they deserve. Because while there may be names you know, there are also a number of things that the organizations they joined do to try and make life better for Black folks.\n\nThurgood Marshall, the first Black Supreme Court Justice, was an Alpha. But that (my) organization is also responsible for millions of people being registered to vote. Alphas also introduced the “Go-to-High School, Go-to-College” campaign in 1919, which led to generations of Black teens getting a college education. \n\n And, of course, there is the great Shirley Chisholm. She was the first Black woman to be elected to Congress, and she was a member of Delta Sigma Theta. But we should not forget that DST advocated fiercely for there to be anti-lynching laws and played a pivotal role in getting Black woman to support the women’s suffrage movement.\n\nCarter G. Woodson, a historian and founder of Negro history week which later became Black History Month, was an Omega. But we should celebrate how members of that organization, people whose names many of us won’t remember, made significant contributions to organizations like the Southern Negro Congress and the National Urban League. \n\nMany of us know that Vice President Kamala Harris is a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha. And yeah, the stereotype is that they are pretty. Yet, don’t know that they were the first organization to have a life membership with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), and that organization goes to great lengths to draw attention to the health of Black women.\n\nWe have to put some respect on the name of Kappa Alpha Psi who don’t just shimmy on stage, but when a member of their organization stood up for Black folks by kneeling on a NFL field, the fraternity sent a letter of support to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell then protested outside of NFL games, and in front of the NFL headquarters in New York. \n\nWe can poke fun at men who call themselves pretty, but that’s admirable.

So noise outside of that, I think I’ve done what lots of people who find themselves in the public eye do, which is just try and ignore it.' \n\nDays later, Joe gave his first ever late-night television interview when he appeared on Seth Meyers' show - which was met with a gushing reaction from fans.\n\nOne commented on the show's YouTube: 'He's so lovely. Intelligent, mature, quiet, well-spoken, kind, has humility, and good-looking. Seems like a lovely person. He's a great actor - phenomenal in The Brutalist!! I love that he is getting rave reviews!'\n\nAnother added: 'So happy to see Joe in his debut night-time talk show ! I love his understated sense of humour that runs through his answers.' \n\nThat same week, the star also appeared at a couple of Fashion Week shows - starting with Giorgio Armani in Milan and Dior in Paris.\n\nIn his second glossy magazine interview of the month, Joe - who reportedly struggled with the 'attention from the public' his relationship received - told GQ in January: 'I've always loved Dior and I've always loved Kim Jones.\n\n'There's been a few memorable moments for me in the last few years where I've gotten to wear them. I just really love their tailoring.' \n\nAfter being hesitant to do press during his relationship with Taylor, Joe - who has been brushing shoulders with Alexa Chung, Michelle Dockery and Rege-Jean Page in the wake of his split - gave a surprisingly honest interview to Wonderland magazine last year too.\n\nPictured: Joe Alwyn - who stars in The Brutalist - attends the Dior menswear show in Paris last month\n\nPictured: Joe Alwyn and Michelle Dockery attend the JW Anderson show during London Fashion Week in September 2024\n\nPictured: Alexa Chung and Joe Alwyn attend day ten of the Wimbledon Tennis Championships last July\n\nIn November, the star alluding to growing cynical about the acting industry and how he pined after his first role, Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk.\n\nIn conversation with his Catherine Called Birdy co-star Bella Ramsay, Joe said: 'I feel like I’ve been slightly chasing that experience ever since.\n\n'I think there’s the realisation that it won’t be the same again, and I’ve come to terms with that. Your eyes are wide in a way they aren’t after. And as time’s passed and I’ve worked more, there’s—in some ways I wish there weren’t—a business side to the whole thing. \n\n'I try to ignore that as much as possible, but it creeps up in various ways. I find that difficult because it can impact your experience of a job in a way I had no idea about initially. So, it colours things differently.'\n\nThe interview came just four months after Joe Alwyn appeared on the front cover of The Sunday Times' Style magazine, with the feature titled: 'London Boy: What Joe Alwyn Did Next.'\n\nPictured: Joe Alwyn arrives at the Giorgio Armani fashion show during Milan Fashion Week last month\n\nPictured: The Brutalist actors Adrien Brody and Joe Alwyn attend the launch of the new Aston Martin Vanquish\n\nPictured: Rege-Jean Page and Joe Alwyn attend the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures 4th Annual Gala in Los Angeles in October 2024\n\nBreaking his silence on the split, Joe described his time with Taylor as 'long, loving' and 'fully committed.'\n\nWhen asked if he listened to her latest album, The Tortured Poets Department, which is rumored to be about their breakup, Alwyn said: 'In thinking on what I was going to say, I would think and hope that anyone and everyone can empathise... \n\n'This isn’t a direct answer to your question, but just thinking about what I want to talk about.'\n\n'I would hope that anyone and everyone can empathise and understand the difficulties that come with the end of a long, loving, fully committed relationship of over six and a half years.\n\nThe Conversations with Friends star proceeded to admit that the end of their long-term relationship has been 'a hard thing to navigate.'\n\nFollowing the interview, an insider claimed Joe initially wanted to avoid publicly discussing their relationship - but the persistent interest became too much to ignore, especially when he is on the promotional tour for his new film, Kinds of Kindness.\n\n'He cannot go anywhere without being asked about Taylor,' they said. 'He had his people tell everyone in advance that he was not going to answer questions about Taylor, but he knew that is all people wanted to ask him about.\n\n'It became depressing and emotionally draining. Their romance was private – quite the opposite of her relationship with Travis [Kelce]. It was partly due to covid restrictions, but they also preferred it that way.'\n\nJoe was one of the producers on her hit record Folklore, and notably helped co-write the tracks Betty and Exile. However, the actor was notably credited under the pseudonym of William Bowery. \n\nPictured: Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn arrive for a meal at Japanese restaurant Zuma in New York in October 2019\n\nPictured: Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn at the 77th Annual Golden Globe Awards in Los Angeles in January 2020\n\nPictured: Taylor Swift with new boyfriend Travis Kelce, who has had no problem embracing the publicity that comes with dating the singer\n\nTaylor previously told Apple Music in 2020: 'Joe and I really love sad songs. We've always bonded over music...We write the saddest. We just really love sad songs. What can I say?'\n\nIn 2022, Alwyn told Harper's Bazaar: 'I completely expect people to ask those questions [about their relationship], if I’m putting work into the world, of course people are going to ask about that.'\n\nBut he added definitively: 'I can understand that those questions would be asked, but I don’t see why these questions should always be answered'.\n\nSwifties became convinced they were planning to get married or had already secretly walked down the aisle, especially after they spent the pandemic together. But Joe was again absolute in his silence.\n\n'If I had a pound for every time I think I've been told I've been engaged, then I'd have a lot of pound coins,' he said.\n\n'I mean, the truth is, if the answer was yes, I wouldn't say, and if the answer was no, I wouldn't say.'\n\nPictured: Joe Alwyn wears an Artists for Ceasefire pin to the BAFTAs in February 2024 after publicly signing the petition\n\nPictured: Emma Stone and Joe Alwyn attend the opening night premiere of The Favourite in New York in September 2018\n\nTaylor's muse! How Taylor Swift's 'fiancé' Joe Alwyn went from low-key Bristol student to A-Lister starring in steamy Conversations with Friends adaption (and he's even co-written her new album) \n\nFollowing his high-profile split, Joe Alwyn has also been more outspoken on politics - notably signing an Artists for Ceasefire petition and wearing their pin on the BAFTA red carpet last February.\n\nAlthough Taylor has previously weighed in on politics and notably endorsed Kamala Harris in the last presidential election, the pop star - who boasts 282m Instagram followers - stayed mute during the war between Israel and Hamas, despite mounting pressure from fans.\n\nIn addition, the actor signed a letter to Keir Starmer ahead of the General Election calling him to stop arming Israel.\n\nBefore their break-up, Joe appeared in Taylor's 2020 Miss Americana Netflix documentary and was seen cheering her on from the side of one of her tour shows.\n\nAfter finishing her Reputation show, the star rushed off stage to hug her other half.\n\nElsewhere in the documentary, Taylor explained why she wanted to take a different approach with their relationship - in comparison to her high-profile relationships with Harry Styles, Tom Hiddleston and Joe Jonas.\n\nShe said: 'I was falling in love with someone who had a really wonderfully normal, balanced, grounded life and we decided together that we wanted our relationship to be private.'\n\nHowever, that doesn't stand in the way of Taylor making plain reference to the leading man in her life in her music.\n\nIn her 2019 album Lover, the star penned the pop single London Boy - acknowledging that the 'rumours are true' and that she 'loves the English'. \n\nAfter 2020, Joe co-wrote six songs with Taylor - including Betty, Exile, Champagne Problems and Coney Island. \n\nThe pair penned the album's most personal song Sweet Nothing together - which pained a heartwarming picture of their former life together.\n\nOpening about the pressure she feels as an artist, Taylor wrote: 'And the voices that implore, \"You should be doing more\". To you, I can admit that I'm just too soft for all of it.'\n\nTaylor SwiftJoe Alwyn\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nHow Taylor Swift's ex Joe Alwyn is chasing fame in wake of his split from pop megastar - after 'breaking up over privacy fears'\n\nAdd comment","summary":"For six whole years, he was known the world over as 'Mr. Taylor Swift '.

And they liked it more each time they looked.\n\n‘So it does look like it’s happening. They’ve been seen around there several times in recent weeks and have even had interactions with neighbours.’\n\nThe modern mansion that the couple are understood to have visited several times is set in the hugely expensive area of the Cotswolds where stars including David and Victoria Beckham, Simon Cowell and Kate Moss have their homes\n\nAlso in the vicinity of the property’s extensive 100 acres of surrounding farmland, is renowned celebrity haven Soho Farmhouse where Harry and Meghan spent early dates before they married.\n\nThe source added: ‘It represents quite a change for them - from a traditional farmhouse to something much more Hollywood. But I guess that’s what they felt like after their first winter in England.\n\n'But whatever the weather does they won't be flooded again as it’s at the top of a hill =- and the views are spectacular.'\n\nAlso in the vicinity of the property’s extensive 100 acres of surrounding farmland, is renowned celebrity haven Soho Farmhouse where Harry and Meghan spent early dates before they married\n\nNow locals the couple may have had enough and are eyeing up a new possible home (Pictured: Unpassable roads in nearby Dunsden, Oxfordshire)\n\nEllen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi posed for a photo in The Cotswolds - which they currently call home\n\nEllen DeGeneres and her wife pose in the Cotswolds countryside after their home was hit by flooding\n\nThe striking modern home has huge floor-to-ceiling windows offering breathtaking panoramic views of the Cotswolds. \n\nBut before its dramatic transformation, the farmhouse was left unoccupied and semi derelict before being bought up by a local architect.\n\nThe transformation he oversaw was dramatic: the single-story home, which has been lauded with architectural awards, offers a huge 10,000 square feet of living space\n\nAnd more than 1,000 trees have been planted on the surrounding estate.\n\nIt’s understood that the property first caught Portia’s eye on social media.\n\nAnd she’s thought to have seen enough to be tempted to make the journey of 30 or so minutes from their current base to then view it in person, later persuading Ellen to see it too.\n\nThey are now said to be seriously contemplating switching their homes.\n\nEllen and Portia first decided to relocate across the Atlantic to Oxfordshire following Kamala Harris’ doomed campaign - which the talk show superstar had supported.\n\nThe couple had already bought the home in June last year, paying £2.5 million over the asking price, after ‘falling in love’ with the rolling estate, which is equipped with a helicopter launch pad and swimming pool.\n\nEllen and Portia were seen in November settling in to their new surroundings in the Cotswolds by enjoying a night out at Jeremy Clarkson's pub, 'The Farmer's Dog'\n\nNow president-elect Donald Trump takes the stage during a campaign rally in Raleigh, North Carolina on November 4 \n\nA local claimed 'it does look like' the pair were eyeing up a modern mansion in the lavish Cotswolds\n\nBut it was only after Trump’s landslide win that the pair sold off their $32 million Montecito home and made the permanent move.\n\n‘Ellen has fallen in love with the property in the Cotswolds,’ one source told The Sun at the time. ‘She has been on the lookout for a house in the area and often visits her celebrity pals.\n\n‘A Cotswolds house has become a status symbol in the celebrity world and Ellen wanted to join the pack.’\n\nBut just weeks after arriving, their quaint Cotswold village and its surrounds was hit by Storm Bert, with huge flood waters surrounding their new home.\n\nThe area had been battered with 80mph winds and lashings of torrential rain.\n\n‘The flood waters are rising by the hour,’ one local resident who lives near the couple said at the time. ‘This is the worst I have seen in years.’\n\n'It has been absolutely bleak – it's a beautiful area but the weather has just been a nightmare and it's only going to get worse,’ another added.\n\n'God knows what those two must be thinking after leaving California to come here. The English countryside is a long way from Los Angeles, and I doubt they were prepared for this sort of thing.\n\n'I wonder whether next time they're wading home through a soaking wet field if they might think it wasn't worth the trouble.'\n\nEllen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi at the 77th Annual Golden Globe Awards in 2020\n\nEllen DeGeneres walks onstage during the Michelle Obama: The Light We Carry Tour at Warner Theatre on November 15, 2022\n\nTo make matters worse, the couple had a run-in with locals in the area, after concerns were raised that construction works taking place at their property could cause disturbance to Roman remains nearby.\n\nLocal councillors at the village parish meeting were unimpressed that the couple’s developers had not sought planning permission for a single-storey extension at the site, leading to a ‘technical breach’.\n\nThe council minutes said that ‘concern was expressed by residents that the hedge and wire fence could increase flood risk in the village’ if rubbish was swept down and ‘caught on the fence’, thereby ‘limiting flow across the field’.\n\nThose displeased included local heiress Rosie Pearson - the youngest child of Viscount Cowdray, who later said she first raised the issue.\n\nShe told the Oxford Mail: ‘I was at the meeting when it was discussed and yes, I contacted the officer because an extension had gone up without permission.\n\n‘It was found not to be a material breach, and that there had been no threat to any possibility of Roman remains.’\n\nThe planning tiff may have been another spur in Ellen and Portia’s hunt for a new home in the Cotswolds.\n\nIt may seem dramatic to change houses so relatively quickly but it’s not apparently out of character: Ellen is said to be a well-known property wheeler dealer, once reportedly telling People magazine that she had bought and sold ‘over 50 houses’ over the years - including one previously owned by Brad Pitt.\n\nIt is unknown if the star held onto any property back in South California, however, she was seen making a return to her former hometown of Montecito in January making a quick visit to the luxury Westlake Village retirement home.\n\nEllen DeGeneres\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nHas Ellen already fallen out of love with her £15million Cotswolds dream home?

Their party is stuck in the political wilderness because they spent four years trying to favorably “message” around their policy failures instead of promoting real solutions to Americans’ problems. Now, one of the governors who wants to lead Democrats out of the wilderness — Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro — is making the same mistake.\n\nOn January 28, Shapiro tried to make a bombshell announcement. He said that PJM Interconnection — a heavily regulated company that manages the electric grid in much of the mid-Atlantic — settled a lawsuit the governor had filed the previous month. According to Shapiro, the company would stop “unnecessary price hikes” and “save consumers over $21 billion on utility bills.” Clearly, the governor wants to suggest that he’s providing Americans relief from the cost-of-living crisis.\n\nDon’t believe a word of it. Shapiro and his fellow Democrats are to blame for soaring energy costs. And despite the hullabaloo, the governor’s settlement will do nothing to give families lasting relief.\n\nHere are the facts. Electricity rates are soaring — in Pennsylvania and nationwide — because Democrats at the state and federal levels are enacting radical climate mandates that shut down affordable, reliable power plants that run on natural gas and coal. And many of the requirements and standards set by these heavy-handed regulations are not even scientifically possible. For example, the Environmental Protection Agency’s power plant rule mandates carbon capture technology that is yet to be invented. At the same time, Democrats have flooded energy markets with subsidies for wind and solar power, which are less reliable and more expensive. Put simply, Democrats have ensured that electricity companies must raise rates to keep the lights on.\n\nShapiro is complicit. He supported the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act, which accelerated the deployment of expensive wind and solar energy projects. He didn’t oppose the Biden administration’s power plant rule, which will shut down power plants that provide cheaper electricity. And he has maintained Pennsylvania’s mandate to obtain nearly 20 percent of its electricity from renewable sources. Lo and behold, the state’s electricity prices are nearly 10 percent higher than the national average — the direct result of these foolish policies.\n\nBut the real story is that Shapiro is setting his state up for even worse pain. His settlement with PJM is centered on price caps — a favorite and failed Democratic policy that will inevitably lead to less investment in Pennsylvania’s electricity grid. And that’s assuming that the price caps last, which is highly unlikely given the competing federal and state demands to build more wind and solar power. For all his bluster, Shapiro has made a “deal” that he knows won’t survive.\n\nMeanwhile, the governor is pushing a slew of other policies that also make future rate hikes inevitable. He’s defending his predecessor’s Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, which is expected to raise electricity costs by at least 30 percent. That plan has already stopped the construction of a new natural gas power plant, despite rising demand for affordable electricity. The governor has also proposed new energy mandates — the state’s Climate Emissions Reduction Act (PACER) and the Reliable Energy Sustainability Standard (PRESS) — that would add additional energy taxes on consumers. If the governor gets his way, Pennsylvania families can look forward to spiraling utility bills, an insult to the injuries they’ve already sustained.\n\nThis is exactly the kind of foolish policy that Democrats tried, and failed, to mask with slick marketing during the Biden years. Shapiro is trying the same trick, telling Pennsylvanians he’s saving them a penny when he’s really picking their pockets. The governor is widely known to have presidential ambitions, but if he doesn’t give families real relief, his future will be dim.\n\nReal solutions — such as ditching the climate mandates and making it easier to build new energy projects — require real leadership. Josh Shapiro should try it rather than message his way around his mistakes in search of the White House. He should ask Kamala Harris how that worked out.","summary":"Josh Shapiro is telling Pennsylvanians he’s saving them a penny when he’s really picking their pockets.","url":"https://www.nationalreview.com/2025/02/pennsylvanias-governor-puts-green-messaging-ahead-of-realistic-solutions/","image":"https://i0.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Josh-Shapiro.jpg?fit=2057%2C1200&ssl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-16 11:30:55","author":"Andrew J.

It is a state with a large population of federal government workers and has not voted for a Republican for president since 1988. Maryland has not had a Republican senator since the liberal Republican Charles Mathias retired in 1987.\n\nEven more to the left than the state as a whole is Montgomery County, Maryland’s most populous county, and one of America’s most progressive. Kamala Harris won 74 percent of the vote there, eleven points higher than her statewide score. Montgomery County has never had a Republican city council president in its history. Republicans have not had a majority on the city council since Lyndon Johnson was president in the 1960s.\n\n“MoCo,” as it is known by locals, is filled with government workers, rainbow flags, and “hate has no home here” signs. Like most of the counties surrounding Washington, D.C., it is a wealthy suburb, with a median household income of over $125,000 and a low poverty rate, of 7.2 percent. Average home values exceed $600,000, and residents, for all their performative progressivism, tend to want to preserve those home values. Unfortunately, sometimes their progressivism and their personal interests come into conflict.\n\nThe county has recently released the “University Boulevard Corridor Draft Plan,” which emphasizes how out of touch its leaders are from what voters want and have indeed recently called for in the 2024 election. The plan is a master class in expanding government even when citizens don’t want it or need it. One of the county’s biggest problems is traffic, and the plan seems designed to exacerbate rather than alleviate matters.\n\nFor one thing, the plan calls for the creation of additional bus lanes on the high-traffic streets of University Boulevard and Colesville Road. The impact of this would be to increase traffic in the fewer available lanes, pretty much the opposite of what is needed. As Manhattan Institute transportation expert Nicole Gelinas notes in her new book Movement, bus lanes can reduce traffic in heavily urbanized areas like Manhattan by encouraging commuters to take the bus instead of driving. Yet Montgomery County lacks the population density of Manhattan, and its buses are frequently empty. One acquaintance of mine who does take the Montgomery County buses calls it his “limo service,” as he and the bus driver are often the only two people on the bus.\n\nTo make traffic matters worse, the plan pushes what it calls “major speed limit reductions” on University Boulevard and Colesville Road as well as other busy streets. Drivers would be forced to go slower, and the new impositions would be enforced by additional speed cameras to catch you if you dare go over. In addition, to annoy drivers even further, the plan calls for an end to merge lanes and right turns on red lights. This unwise policy brings to mind Woody Allen’s legendary comment, in Annie Hall, about the differences between New York and L.A.: “I don’t want to move to a city where the only cultural advantage is being able to make a right turn on a red light.” Montgomery County lacks the cultural advantages of either locale and would lose this advantage as well if the time-saving right turn on red were eliminated. Overall, the plan is reminiscent of another government-heavy central plan already implemented in Rockville, another part of Montgomery County, that residents say has exacerbated rather than alleviated congestion problems.\n\nAs bad as the traffic-snarling interventions are, the county did not stop there. It also calls for “mixed use” and “higher density” housing in certain quiet suburban areas. While the plan is light on the details, those who follow planning-commission discussions know that these phrases are often Newspeak for bringing low-income housing to leafy well-off suburbs. Objectors to these concepts typically get accused of NIMBY-ism, but the reason they object is that those types of housing often lead to increased crime, additional traffic, and reduced housing values.\n\nOverall, the document reeks of central planning and government interventionism in the wake of an election in which the message from voters in many parts of the country seemed to be We don’t want what the government is selling. Voters want government that works for citizens. In the recent elections, Republicans nationwide improved in nearly every demographic category, including with blacks, Hispanics, women, and both young men and young women. These GOP gains appeared to derive from a perception that government officials were more concerned with demonstrating fealty to progressivism than in making citizens’ lives better or easier. Even progressive Montgomery County saw some evidence of this pushback in 2024. While Harris won the county convincingly, she garnered 5 percent less of the vote than Joe Biden did in 2020.\n\nStill, given its overwhelming progressivism, Montgomery County has made clear in multiple ways that it wants to resist the national trend. Montgomery County Public Schools (MCPS) recently pledged to “use all legal means necessary” on behalf of its values. So far, these means include calling to resist efforts to end DEI education in its schools and criticizing potential cuts in education funding, calling them “catastrophic.” In addition, a group of parents unhappy with MCPS’s use of LGBTQ+ books have sued the county for the chance to let their children “opt out” from those materials. The case is headed to the Supreme Court.\n\nResidents are also pushing back against the draft traffic plan. The Kemp Mill Civic Association, the civic association in one of the most affected areas, has organized in opposition to much of the plan. At a special meeting on February 5 to discuss the plan, 62 members showed, nearly double the attendance of a normal meeting. They are submitting a letter outlining their concerns. While it may seem like an uphill battle, they recall the example of a previous organizing effort that defeated another misbegotten county overreach, the North Central Freeway plan\n\nBeyond Montgomery County itself, across the country, voters have made clear that they want the government to intervene less in their daily lives, experiment on them less, and get out of the way more. Montgomery County consistently moves in the opposite direction of those sentiments in a variety of ways. MoCo’s leaders apparently feel that the overwhelming progressivism of the county protects them at the ballot box. What the 2024 election results show is that Montgomery County remains considerably out of step with the rest of the country, but that at least some Montgomery County voters are paying attention.","summary":"The country wants less government.

Susan Collins’ bid for reelection in 2026 as a potentially pivotal race — and a very expensive one.\n\nOne prominent national political forecaster said last week that, while Maine’s Republican senator is currently narrowly favored to win reelection next year, the race will likely be rated as a toss-up.\n\nThe forecast from Sabato’s Crystal Ball, a project of the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics, comes as the Senate Republican campaign arm reportedly predicted that both parties would spend $400 million to $600 million on the race for Collins’ seat — a sum that would eclipse the total spending in the 2020 race, which broke records in Maine and was the second most expensive Senate race in the United States that year.\n\nSo far, Collins — who said she plans to seek reelection — is facing one declared challenger: Waterboro resident Phillip Rench, a 37-year-old former engineer at Elon Musk’s SpaceX who now owns Ossipee Hill Farm and Observatory. Rench is running as an independent and said last week he was not ready to talk about his candidacy.\n\nSabato’s Crystal Ball released its initial U.S. Senate rankings Thursday.\n\nAuthors Kyle Kondik and J. Miles Coleman wrote that Maine’s Senate race leans Republican, but they predicted that the race would be moved into the toss-up column given that the 72-year-old Collins is the only Republican running in a state won by former Vice President Kamala Harris in November.\n\n“The only state that we put in the Leans category, from either side, is Maine,” they wrote. “While we are doing this, at least for now, as a nod to the crossover support that Susan Collins has generated through the years, given the bigger state of play, we fully expect it’ll eventually make its way towards the Toss-up column.”\n\nThe Cook Political Report also has the race as leaning Republican, calling Collins a “perpetual survivor — and the Democrats’ white whale.”\n\nThe initial assessments of the race reflect Mainers’ well-known willingness to split their ballots.\n\nIn 2020, Collins was the only Republican to win a Senate seat in a state won by Joe Biden. She also is the only Republican member of Congress in New England.\n\nOn the other side of the aisle, Democrat Jared Golden won reelection to the U.S. House of Representatives last fall against a Trump-backed Republican challenger in the 2nd Congressional District, which Trump carried by more than 9 points.\n\nBut there also are factors that could work against Collins.\n\nThe National Republican Senatorial Committee appears to agree with the suggestions that it will be difficult for her to hold the seat in 2026. Republicans are in control of the White House, U.S. Senate and House of Representatives, and voters tend to favor the party that’s out of power in midterm elections.\n\nCampaign Chairman Tim Scott reportedly told donors gathered at President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach last weekend that Maine is one of three battlegrounds where the party will be playing defense, according to Politico, which cited an attendee who wished to remain anonymous because they were sharing details of a private meeting.\n\nScott reportedly predicted that both parties would spend a combined $400 million to $600 million in Maine alone, according to the attendee, who said Republicans are also playing defense in Ohio and North Carolina.\n\nCollins was among the Republican senators who traveled to Mar-a-Lago last weekend to meet with Trump. She does not yet have a campaign staff.\n\nIf that level of spending comes to fruition, it would be two to three times more than the $200 million spent in 2020, when state Speaker of the House Sarah Gideon unsuccessfully challenged Collins.\n\nCollins has nearly $2.6 million in her campaign war chest.\n\nSENATOR UNDER SCRUTINY\n\nMeanwhile, with her district already identified as a key battleground, Collins’ every move is being closely scrutinized by Democrats and Republicans as she tries to carefully navigate some tricky terrain in Trump’s second term.\n\nCollins has had a tortured relationship with the man who has remade the Republican Party in his own image. She has not supported any of his three campaigns for president, most recently writing in former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley for president last fall.\n\nAnd Collins was one of seven Republican senators to vote to impeach Trump for his role in the Jan. 6, 2021 riots at the Capitol — a vote for which the Maine Republican Party considered censuring her. Collins is one of three senators from that group who continue to serve in the Senate, and this will be her first campaign for reelection since casting that impeachment vote.\n\nBut Collins has navigated this dynamic before, having warded off a challenge from Gideon in 2020. That also was an expensive campaign in which Democrats were riding a wave of resistance to Trump. And many voters at the time were outraged over Collins’ pivotal vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court, which helped remake the court majority and end federal abortion protections under Roe v. Wade.\n\nDespite being down in polling and outspent by a 2-to-1 margin by Gideon, Collins went on to win by 9 points, even as Trump lost the statewide tally by 9 points to Biden.\n\nCollins has so far avoided any dramatic breaks with Trump during his month-old second term.\n\nWith few exceptions, Collins has delivered key votes in support of Trump’s controversial Cabinet nominees, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Tulsi Gabbard. But she has still faced sharp criticism and calls for a primary challenge from Trump loyalists because of her opposition to two other nominees.\n\nCollins said she was “shocked” that Trump nominated former Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida to be attorney general while he was being investigated for alleged illicit drug use and paying a minor for sex. Gaetz, who denied the charges, withdrew and never faced a vote.\n\nAnd Collins voted against former Fox News personality Pete Hegseth’s nomination as defense secretary. Hegseth was approved anyway when Vice President JD Vance broke a 50-50 tie.\n\nPerhaps no other Trump nominee shows the tightrope Collins is walking better than Russell Vought, the new White House budget chief.\n\nVought has made it clear that he believes the president has the authority to cut congressionally approved funding for programs that he does not support — a view that critics, including Sen. Angus King, argue is unconstitutional and violates the separation of powers that places spending decisions with Congress.\n\nThat view has led to the Trump administration’s controversial freezing of federal grants and loans, and its efforts to end entire programs, including the U.S. Agency on International Development — moves that also have been condemned by Collins.\n\nEarlier this year, Collins ascended to leadership of the Senate Appropriations Committees, where she is expected to play a key role in Congress’ funding priorities, including securing money for projects in Maine.\n\nCollins voted in support of Vought, even though his view of the president’s power to impound spending approved by Congress essentially usurps her power as budget chair. She says she is hopeful that a Watergate-era law limiting presidential power over spending will mean that the judicial branch can keep the administration in check.\n\n“If there are impoundments, I believe it will end up in court,” Collins told the Portland Press Herald/Maine Sunday Telegram, “and my hope is the court will rule in favor of the 1974 Impoundment and Budget Control Act.”\n\nSo far, Rench, the little-known independent, is the only Collins challenger to emerge.\n\nHowever, high on the list of potential contenders is Gov. Janet Mills, who would not rule out a run when asked by the Portland Press Herald/Maine Sunday Telegram in December. The Democrat is in her final two years as governor because of term limits after easily winning back-to-back statewide elections.","summary":"One national political forecaster says the 2026 race will likely be a toss-up, but for now, Maine's senior senator looks to have an initial advantage because of her historical crossover appeal, which will be tested in Trump's second term.","url":"https://www.centralmaine.com/2025/02/16/susan-collins-reelection-bid-already-shaping-up-as-pivotal-and-very-expensive-race/","image":"https://w2pcms.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/02/AP25044577069574.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-16 09:00:17","author":"Randy Billings","authors":["Randy Billings"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.159},{"id":291135804,"title":"Kamla's right turn?","text":"Opposition Leader Kamla Persad-Bissessar’s criticism of former US President Joe Biden for what she deemed a ‘woke’ and ‘extreme’ agenda, may have shocked some and drew condemnation from others- but her statements and her subsequent defense of them are not unprecedented.\n\nThe country’s first female Prime Minister has within the past few years adopted a rhetoric not dissimilar from current President Donald Trump’s, who in his first hours in office last Monday signed a flurry of executive orders on issues of immigration, gender and diversity.\n\nThey were points on which President Trump had campaigned from as far back as 2016, and which formed tenets of the right-leaning Republican party’s drive for a “return to common sense” in America.\n\nBut calls for stricter immigration policies and deportations, ‘stand your ground,’ laws that seek to make easier citizen’s ability to own legal firearms, and skepticism levied against the establishment have been peppered within Persad-Bissessar’s speeches from as far back as 2020, on the heels of the then General Elections and the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn defense of her remarks aimed at President Biden earlier this week, Persad-Bissessar on Tuesday extended a list of points on which she questioned the People’s National Movement (PNM) stance.\n\nPersad-Bissessar herself stated in her release, “My record will show that since 2020, I have been advocating against this woke far-left extreme insanity.”\n\nThis is everything Mrs. Persad-Bissessar has said on her official platforms that arguably resemble Republican American/Trump positions since that time \n\nVaccine Skepticism\n\nAt a Monday night forum in September 2024, Persad-Bissessar critiqued the country’s COVID-19 vaccination drive, stating that citizens were given ‘fake vaccines,’- a claim that was immediately condemned by Minister of Health Terrence Deyalsingh.\n\nOn September 9, while speaking at a United National Congress (UNC) Cottage meeting, Persad-Bissessar said, “This is a government that fooled the nation into believing that there was a ‘parallel healthcare system’ during the pandemic when the reality was different…Thereafter, 5,000 people died, hundreds of thousands were given a fake vaccine…”\n\nThe vaccines administered by the Ministry were approved by the World Health Organisation (WHO), and 89.1% of country’s COVID-19 deaths were unvaccinated persons, the Minister of Health responded.\n\nAsked to retract Persad-Bissessar however instead doubled down, stating that mandatory COVID-19 vaccinations were pushed.\n\n(Note: Only COVID-19 vaccines approved for use by the World Health Organization (WHO) were used by the Ministry in its vaccination efforts, according to its website. The WHO is committed to the critical evaluation of all new vaccines for their safety and effectiveness before their authorization for use.)\n\nPersad-Bissessar was notably also on the receiving end of flak in the early pandemic for her 2020 statement that ‘sunlight will kill COVID,’- a sentiment which was suggested by Trump in April of that year during a COVID-19 briefing. \n\n“There’s been a rumour that – you know, a very nice rumour – that you go outside in the sun, or you have heat and it does have an effect on other viruses... I would like you to speak to the medical doc tors to see if there's any way to apply light and heat to a cure...maybe you could, maybe you can't,” Trump had said.\n\nAccording to the WHO’s COVID-10 MythBusters page, however, “You can catch COVID-19, no matter how sunny or hot the weather is.”\n\nThough Persad-Bissessar’s claims questioning the authenticity of the COVID-19 are not a direct parallel to sentiments shared by President Trump, vaccine and healthcare skepticism were abundant during his 2016-2020 tenure, and at the peak of the global pandemic.\n\nPresident Trump, who was largely credited for a push to develop and roll out a COVID-19 vaccine, was also the subject of criticism for alleged downplaying of the virus in its initial stages.\n\nPrior to his election win, Trump in August stated during a campaign, “I will not give one penny to any school that has a vaccine mandate or a mask mandate.” -a promise he signed into action on Friday, halting federal funding to schools with COVID-19 vaccine mandates.\n\nAnd on the heels of his second Presidential term, Trump selected Robert F. Kennedy Jr, a vaccine skeptic, to lead the US Department of Health and Human Services. He also said his administration would look into a long-debunked link between vaccines and autism.\n\nIn his interview with Time Magazine just days after he was elected, Trump responded, “The autism rate is at a level that nobody ever believed possible. If you look at things that are happening, there's something causing it,” when asked about a potential end to childhood vaccination programs.\n\nGuns/Right to bear arms\n\nThroughout the UNC’s campaigning for the 2023 Local Government Elections, the party proposed the introduction of ‘stand your ground,’ legislation, which it touted as a means to make legal firearms more accessible to law-abiding citizens, and combat home invasions and violent crime.\n\nOn July 31 of that year, Persad-Bissessar spoke at a UNC meeting, expanding on the proposed laws, and cited a story of a woman who killed a home invader. Under the Stand Your Ground laws she said, “When the criminals invade your homes, you can draw your licensed firearm and light them up! Empty the whole clip! Empty it! Light them up! We have to fight fire with fire!” she then said.\n\nHer statement was then described by Prime Minister Dr Keith Rowley as being “reckless and irresponsible.” But responding to this, Persad-Bissessar later said, “I want to make one thing very clear concerning my comments to light up the criminals who invade your homes. I apologise... to absolutely no one for saying to light up criminals who are invading homes, killing mercilessly and forcing you to live in fear!”\n\nCampaigning for the 2016 Presidential Elections in February of that year, President Trump released a 30-second video to his Facebook, in which he stated, “I won’t let them take away our guns. “\n\nHis campaign stated that he believed every American had ‘God-given right,’ to protect themselves, and that he would defend law-abiding gun owners.\n\nAfter facing harsh criticism throughout his first term for what some believed to be a lack of action in dealing with the issue of gun violence and assault weapons, Trump last year addressed the US National Rifle Association (NRA) - a nonprofit which lobbies for gun rights- describing himself as “the best friend gun owners have ever had in the White House”.\n\n“During my four years, nothing happened,” Trump said. “And there was great pressure on me having to do with guns. We did nothing. We didn’t yield,” he said in February.\n\nHe later received the NRA’s official endorsement.\n\nImmigrants/Deportation\n\nIn the aftermath of the killing of the elderly Winston Thomas last November Persad-Bissessar issued a lengthy statement attributing his killing to illegal Venezuelan migrants. Thomas, 69, was taken from his Penal home by spanish-speaking men, police were told. He was later found deceased in the back seat of his vehicle near Golconda.\n\nDays after his killing, Persad-Bissessar called for action against Venezuelan migrants, whom she said were committing crimes against citizens.\n\n“I will not stand idly by as this current government has done and allow more citizens like Mr. Winston Thomas to be terrorized and murdered by illegal Venezuelan migrants…The well-being of Trinidad and Tobago citizens must always come first, our nation’s generosity is now being exploited and our citizens terrorized...Illegal Venezuelan migrants have a clear choice to make, either peaceful law-abiding habitation in our country or deportation, there is no middle ground. Their future within our country rests solely in the decisions they make in the coming months,” Persad-Bissessar said.\n\nHer statement followed a global trend in anti-immigration sentiment championed by right-wing and right- from-centre leaning political groups, including that of the American GOP (Grand Old Party).\n\nThe 2024 GOP platform which was approved and formally adopted at the Republican National Convention in July committed to seal the American border and ‘stop a migrant invasion.’\n\n“Republicans offer an aggressive plan to stop the open-border policies that have opened the floodgates to a tidal wave of illegal Aliens, deadly drugs, and Migrant Crime. We will end the Invasion at the Southern Border, restore Law and Order, protect American Sovereignty, and deliver a Safe and Prosperous Future for all Americans,” it stated.\n\nA series of orders signed by President Trump following his inauguration weeks ago facilitated a systematic crack down on undocumented immigrants in the US, and a bid to cut off birthright citizenship for the children of noncitizens- the latter of which is the subject of legal contention.\n\nEven so, Persad-Bissessar’s call came after proposed anti-immigration sentiment and policy changes have also swept across other western and European nations in recent times.\n\nIn Sweden for example, the official government offices’ website currently cites a ‘paradigm shift’ in migration policy and a government effort to reduce the number of migrants coming to the country. “Labour immigration fraud and abuse must be stopped and the ‘shadow society’ combated,” it states.\n\nIn the Netherlands, Geert Wilders, who in 2017 called Moroccan immigrants “scum,” saw his Party for Freedom succeeding in the country’s national elections in November.\n\nIn Italy, Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni came to power promising to curb immigration to the country. In late 2023, the Italian government launched a crackdown passing measures to give authorities power to detain migrants for as long as 18 months.\n\nBring religion back into schools\n\nPersad-Bissessar also last year announced her intent to restore religion to the nation’s classrooms if elected in the 2025 General Elections.\n\nShe was speaking at a Town Hall meeting on Education in November, when she responded to a question on the performance of denominational schools compared to state schools. A question asked by an audience member proposed that all schools in the country become denominational, to which she responded, “On the issue of denominational school you are right, they are doing better and it was my proposal , we have not thrashed it out fully but the new UNC government will work with all religious organizations to bring religion into schools, all denominational schools and for others who are failing and trailing, we want to partner more with religious organizations.”\n\nConservative lawmakers in the US have long pushed for more Christianity in classrooms, with President Trump and the GOP planning to champion the right to pray and read the Bible in school.\n\nThe GOP 2024 platform states, “Republicans will champion the First Amendment Right to Pray and Read the Bible in school and stand up to those who violate the Religious Freedoms of American students.”\n\n‘Woke agenda’ 2025\n\nThough she had initially congratulated former President Biden for his win of the 2020 US Presidential race, calling the results ‘a victory for democracy,’ and the ‘dawn of a new era for the American people,’ Persad-Bissessar’s views on Biden seemed to take a turn when Vice President Kamala Harris lost the election to Trump last November.\n\nIn a congratulatory message on November 6, Persad-Bissessar noted Trump’s drive to restore conservative American values which she said had been ‘under attack,’ by promoters of a far-left ideology.\n\nAnd last week, she issued a statement calling the Biden Administration a ‘disaster,’ which focused on pushing the same left-wing agenda.\n\n“They focused on pushing a woke, extreme left-wing agenda that offended basic common sense and morality, overturned the norms of civilised public life, disoriented and mutilated children, censored and cancelled dissenting views, disparaged religious and conservative values, fuelled wars around the world, weaponized the judicial system against political opponents and increased nepotism, corruption, crime, poverty, homelessness, and wealth inequality,” Persad--Bissessar said.\n\nIn her defense of her own statement, following widespread backlash, Persad-Bissessar doubled down on her initial critique and cited gender reassignment surgery, drag queen shows, transgender women, gendered pronouns, alleged forced health mandates, removal of religion in schools, and the alleged censorship of free speech, as examples of things that occurred under the previous administration.\n\nSeveral of these points were similarly raised in the GOP’s platform and have been conservative talking points throughout the US election campaigning, and within traditional right- leaning and conservative media platforms.\n\nThe Rise of the Right-Wing\n\nAnalysts say Persad-Bissessar’s statements may bear a surface resemblance to those repeatedly echoed within a rising global right-wing/right leaning political landscape.\n\nBut the question of whether the United National Congress (UNC) political leader is following a trend towards the right -as has been seen throughout Europe, the US, and which some analysts say they expect in upcoming Canadian elections-, is not so simply answered.\n\nSpeaking to the Express last week analysts noted that Persad-Bissessar’s statements were specific responses to issues occurring domestically that are not necessarily attached to a global movement from centre on the spectrum.\n\nPolitical Scientist Dr Maukesh Basdeo told the Express that an in-depth analysis of the Opposition Leader’s propositions and policies was necessary to make such a comparison. However, he said her statements were amid a notable trend towards the right, across the continental US and Europe.\n\n“In a political spectrum we put the ideologies with the centre being liberalism and left being communism as the extreme and then you have the far-right conservatism. From a political standpoint what we have been seeing within the decade is a shift from the centre which can lean left or right, is the centre leaning right away from what you call the left. It is a trend happening all over the world.”\n\n“Think about Italy. This year there will be elections in Germany and by all indications I see the rise of the right in Germany. We have seen the success of Marie LePen in France, and she is right on the spectrum. What we are also witnessing, and we may see later this year is the case of the Prime Minister of Canada who has indicated he is stepping down from active politics, his party will have to elect a new leader. All indications are that the conservative right will succeed in that election…I think Mrs. Persad-Bisessar's statement is an indication of this. It may take an assessment of the policies she has proposed in the past five years…,” he said.\n\nIssues such as the deportation of Venezuelan migrants, he said, were umbrella issues that were in need of more detail and context for analysis.\n\n“In the context of the Venezuelan migrants, I am thinking Mrs. Persad-Bissessar was keener on the impact it is having on the internal security of Trinidad. If we juxtapose it against our State of Emergency, and our porous border, it is a key position if you can compare it to Donald Trump. It is something, it follows the same line where national security is a key concern and economic stability are concerns…” he said.\n\nConservative country\n\nPolitical scientist Dr Bishnu Ragoonath said on Sunday that Persad-Bissessar’s statements were not indicative of a global movement as she had maintained a rhetoric on a number of common-ground issues with Trump and the Republican Party, despite his fluctuating popularity within the US. He said he believed she was instead looking at the challenges facing our local society and responding accordingly.\n\n“I do not think she was being directed by the right of centre policies as opposed to left of centre policies which the democrats were projecting,” he said.\n\nAsked if he believed her citing of gender issues may have any effect on voting in the upcoming General Elections, Ragoonah said that the country was still significantly conservative and highly religiously attached.\n\nThe gender issues which may have been projected by other countries, he said, may not necessarily find favour in the ideology of the majority of the country's citizens.\n\n“I recall some years ago they raised the pride flag, and it was the intention by the British to recognise everyone notwithstanding your status but that doesn't mean that because the British did it is accepted in general in Trinidad the LGBTQ community in Trinidad is not significantly publicly large.”\n\n“Those who would have come out and openly supported such a movement, it has not been significant to say it is a significant constituency (in the context of our national electoral system). It is the same complaint I would have had with the MSJ (Movement for Social Justice) for instance. While the MSJ may have support throughout the country their support base is and only consistency is not significantly concentrated to give them a hold on a constituency. That is the manner in which I am talking about the LGBTQ community. Will it take away votes from UNC? I am of the opinion that similar levels of support or conservatism exists in both the UNC and PNM communities,” he said.\n\nPolitical analyst Dr. Shane Mohammed yesterday said that the UNC party had never been a right-wing party. However, he said Persad-Bissessar was likely assessing the current geopolitical landscape, as other countries are likely to do in the context of Trump’s presidency.\n\n“What I do think is smart about Mrs. Persad Bisessar’s comments is it doesn't push a necessary agenda but assesses the situation from a geopolitical and geoeconomic standpoint and takes in to consideration that President Trump, if anyone doubted in their mind that he is serious about what his plans were in terms of ‘Make America Great Again,’ they would have been delusional. All nations whether in the global south or developing need to realign their plans, perspectives, and economic goals with the US based on its new foreign policy,” he said.\n\n“...There are certain alignments that must be returned that speak to a natural order. I do not see anything wrong with that. There are certain elements of what was said that could be seen as extreme in an attempt to ensure we do not step on toes of persons who might be excluded from society. I think how we go about that has to be very well crafted and communicated and dialogue,” he added.\n\n'Message based on Principle'\n\nThe Express contacted the UNC last week to ask about its policy stances and whether it was aligning itself to the global right wing.\n\nResponding last week, the UNC’s Public Relations Officer Dr Kirk Meighoo referred the Express to a letter to the editor, authored by himself. The letter referred to UNC founding member Trevor Sudama, and states that the majority of Americans and Trinidadians do not find what he referred to as the ‘woke agenda,’ to be favourable.\n\n“Her message was based on principle, and certainly not on finding favour with elitist opinion.\n\nEven when it did not appear at all likely that Donald Trump would return to office, the Opposition Leader constantly spoke against the spreading woke agenda, including fake outrage, virtue signalling, and cancel culture, since 2020. It is not a new position,” Meighoo said of Persad-Bissessar’s statements on Trump’s inauguration.\n\nReferring to the political left, he said, “They now look down on, or even actively despise the working classes.The “left”/“progressives” used to stand for free speech. They now stand for government censorship of speech and opinion.The “left”/“progressives” used to be anti-war. They now support unlimited war, even against nuclear powers.”\n\n‘The UNC still stands for the ideals in its constitution, which Mr Sudama helped to draft. When those principles were drafted, those values were mainly seen as “left-wing”. Today, they do not necessarily align all on one side of those global divides. If the global “left”/“progressives” have changed their positions, the UNC sticks by its founding principles, and does not shift to the dangerous and globally impoverishing agenda that the global left has embarked upon.”","summary":"Opposition Leader Kamla Persad-Bissessar’s criticism of former US President Joe Biden for what she deemed a ‘woke’ and ‘extreme’ agenda, may have shocked some and drew condemnation from others- but her statements and her subsequent defense of them are not…","url":"https://trinidadexpress.com/special-report/kamlas-right-turn/article_6ea5d198-e24e-11ef-8e86-97fe538e8213.html","image":"https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/trinidadexpress.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/ea/6ea5d198-e24e-11ef-8e86-97fe538e8213/67b0d20b433e7.social.jpg?resize=1500%2C1060","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-16 09:00:00","author":"Khamarie Rodriguez","authors":["Khamarie Rodriguez"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"TT","sentiment":-0.278},{"id":291013024,"title":"Harris mula kumpul dana menentang dasar Trump","text":"WASHINGTON, 16 FEB – Bekas naib presiden Amerika Syarikat (AS), Kamala Harris, yang tewas kepada Donald Trump dalam pilihan raya presiden November 2024, mula meminta sumbangan daripada pengundi bagi menentang dasar pemimpin AS itu dan memperkukuh Parti Demokrat, menurut teks rayuannya yang dilihat oleh Sputnik/RIA Novosti. \n\n“Hai.

Values are important. But you can't shoot values.”\n\nTrump has also embraced this “tough guy” ethos for much of his time in the public sphere, from his recently released glowering official portrait—compared to the traditional portraits of former Presidents Barack Obama, Joe Biden, and even George W. Bush—to his repeated arguments that Americans need to be “tough.” \n\nTrump even derided the purported weakness of the entire country with the ableist title of his 2015 book, “Crippled America: How To Make America Great Again.”\n\nWhile campaigning for former Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024, Obama poked fun at Trump and other Republicans for embracing “the fake macho thing.”\n\nBut this has been an issue among Republicans predating Trump. \n\nBush infamously dressed up in a flight suit and landed an aircraft carrier to prematurely—and incorrectly—declare victory in the Iraq War while his father, George H.W. Bush, claimed that victory in the first Gulf War meant that the United States “kicked the Vietnam syndrome.”\n\nBut that isn’t how modern superpowers win wars. Rather, it’s intelligence, coalition building, and strategic planning that end conflicts. \n\nIn World War II, the Allied nations did not simply throw military might at the Axis powers in a pure test of “manly” strength. In fact, until the Allies put together a coherent plan of attack in response to German and Japanese aggression, it was the Axis that had more raw firepower.\n\nOne of the most vital breakthroughs of that conflict didn’t come from the “warfighters” that Hegseth goes on about, but by a team of dedicated codebreakers at Bletchley Park in England.\n\nMathematician Alan Turing led the team that cracked the German “Enigma” code, which then allowed the forces on the ground to engage in a strategic fashion, leading to the liberation of Europe and victory in the war. Turing was gay and later persecuted by the British government for his sexual orientation despite his heroism, echoing the attacks on LGBTQ+ military service members that have been renewed by the Trump administration.\n\nModern military experts—not Fox News pundits—have studied the benefits of diversity in the armed forces, and unlike Hegseth, they know that it’s important. \n\nDartmouth College professor Jason Lyall analyzed the issue, which he wrote about in a 2020 article for the Washington Post.\n\n“My research shows that inclusive armies fight harder, suffer lower rates of desertion and defection, and exhibit more creative problem-solving on complex battlefields than armies drawn from marginalized or repressed groups,” he wrote. “Victory on the battlefield over the past 200 years has usually gone to the most inclusive armies, not the largest or best-equipped ones. Inclusion, in other words, is good for military effectiveness.”\n\nAnd despite Hegseth and Trump’s rhetoric, some of the most significant recent U.S. military victories and security advances have come under the leaders the right has attacked for insufficient masculinity.\n\nOsama bin Laden, mastermind of the 9/11 attacks, wasn’t caught because Bush donned his flight suit. Rather, he was apprehended and killed following Obama’s order in 2011.\n\nMany believed that Ukraine would quickly fold when Russia invaded, but Biden stood behind Ukraine and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and Russia has been unable to triumph—though Trump is now pivoting away from that stance.\n\nConservatives like to talk tough, particularly when bolstering the image of straight, white men over women and ethnic minorities. But modern power is more often than not backed by strategic planning, diplomacy, and soft power. It’s what has been used by the United States and other nations in avoiding another calamity like the World Wars, which were tied to the notion that international conflicts were solely the domain of “warfighters.”\n\nBut figures like Hegseth and Trump are locked into the worldview that only people who look like them are legitimate, and everyone else must fall to the wayside. That has historically been the path that leads to unwinnable quagmires, claiming the lives of millions of innocent people.\n\nHistory tells us that this time won’t be any different.","summary":"Explaining the Right is a weekly series that looks at what the right wing is currently obsessing over, how it influences politics—and why you need to know.\n\n\n\n\nSecretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has been a leading voice within the Trump administration for purported masculinity. \n\n\n\nHegseth, who was chosen by Donald Trump to lead the entire U.S. armed forces because he talked tough as a Fox News pundit, has used his new position to extol the virtues of “warfighters” over soft power as the U.S. military’s approach.\n\n\n\nThis principle might have best been demonstrated when Hegseth threw an axe during an episode of “Fox &amp; Friends,” nearly killing a musician.\n\n\n\nxHegseth had his first real test on the world stage yesterday. \n\nIt went about as well as his axe throwing career.\n\n— Pat Ryan (@pkryan.bsky.social) 2025-02-13T17:50:58.064Z\n\nHegseth has attacked military leadership’s efforts to diversify the ranks, recently saying that the notion that “diversity is our strength” is the “single dumbest phrase in military","url":"https://www.dailykos.com/story/2025/2/15/2303779/-Why-conservatives-are-obsessed-with-phony-masculinity?pm_campaign=blog&pm_medium=rss&pm_source=","image":"https://cdn.prod.dailykos.com/images/1398594/story_image/ETR_2.14.png?1739563791","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-16 00:00:06","author":"Oliver Willis","authors":["Oliver Willis"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.243},{"id":290914034,"title":"UK must change defence priorities before it is too late – we can’t hide behind US military anymore","text":"FROM now on, the special relationship looks like it is going to be the one between the United States of America and Russia.\n\nPresident Trump is drawing up plans to meet Russia’s chief thug Vladimir Putin in Saudi Arabia, while our own Prime Minister waits anxiously for his first visit to the MAGA White House.\n\nFor this was the week when an alliance that has endured for 75 years came to a bitter end.\n\nTrump and his flunkies did not simply tell Europe that the USA is no longer going to bankroll European national security.\n\nIt was far worse than that.\n\nThe brutal subtext of all the soundbites about Uncle Sam not being taken for Uncle Sucker was this — Trump is just not that into you, Europe.\n\nIt is undeniable that Europe has been hiding behind America’s military might for a lifetime.\n\nAnd it is true that nobody has spent more on aid to Ukraine than the United States — £73billion, compared with £13billion from Germany, £12billion from the UK and £7billion from Japan.\n\nJapan?

He did the same thing! He came by an irregular route – we gave him sanctuary.”\n\nEagle-eyed readers will have spotted the flaw in Stella’s argument.\n\nPaddington Bear is not real.\n\nPaddington will never need housing.\n\nHe will never need health care.\n\nHe will never produce lots of little baby bears who will need to be watched over from the cradle to the grave.\n\nI agree with Stella Creasy that, “We have to have strong border controls – but also decency”.\n\nLet’s keep our humanity when discussing immigration.\n\nBut last year another 728,000 came here.\n\nThey were all flesh and blood, Stella.\n\nNot fur, fantasy and marmalade sandwiches.\n\nAsteroid panic\n\nTHE odds of an asteroid hitting Earth three days before Christmas 2032 just halved.\n\nThe space rock is the size of a football pitch, moving at 38,000 miles per hour, and would strike our planet with the force of 100 nuclear bombs.\n\nNASA’s Planetary Defense Team currently has no plan.\n\nApparently getting out a Bruce Willis in a grubby vest to save the planet is not an option.\n\nWe will probably be fine.\n\nMind you, that is exactly what the dinosaurs said.\n\nBad year?

Yet the county’s voters have done everything possible to worsen their situation. \n\nThe county’s annual per-capita income is $29,000, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Nearly 18% of its residents live in poverty, similar to the state at large. The national poverty rate was 11% in 2023, the most recent year of complete data. \n\nPrentiss is 81% non-Hispanic white and 15% Black. Given that this is Mississippi, among the most racially politically polarized states in the country, it shouldn’t be surprising that President Donald Trump won the county with 82.7% of the vote to Democrat Kamala Harris’ 16.6%—almost identical to the racial makeup.\n\nNow, thanks in part to the county’s votes, federal food-assistance programs have dried up, with zero chance of them being revived—and it could soon get worse for them. Nearly 18% of Mississippi residents are enrolled in Medicaid, a program currently on the GOP’s chopping block. Also in the crosshairs are subsidized school lunches for needy kids and food stamps. \n\nTrump and billionaire Elon Musk’s assault on assistance programs is in full swing, and it will harm America’s poor more than anyone—and Prentiss is a poor county in the poorest state in the union. \n\nBut I’m sure they’ll console themselves knowing that a handful of transgender women won’t be able to compete in college sports. They really stuck it to those coastal elites! \n\nSpeaking of coastal elites, not all of them are Democrats. \n\nTake Miami-based Ken Griffin, for example. The hedge-fund CEO of Citadel LLC is No. 33 in Forbes’ list of the world’s richest people, with a net worth of $44.3 billion as of Friday. Griffin, a major donor to the Republican Party, told The New York Times in December that he voted for Trump and wasn’t worried about tariffs:\n\nMr. Griffin downplayed one of the biggest concerns about Trumponomics—that tariffs could dent growth and accelerate inflation. He said it remained unclear whether Mr. Trump’s threats to slap tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China would materialize, adding that the talk of tariffs imposed by the United States was “small ball compared to the role that the world is looking to us for.” He said he didn’t see tariffs as the most important business issue.\n\nFast forward just a month and a half later:\n\n“Ken Griffin, founder of investment firm Citadel, warned Tuesday that President Donald Trump's tariff policies pose a serious risk to America's economic growth,” reported the Daily Mail, a tabloid based in the United Kingdom. “He said they may force other countries to find new trade alliances, as he criticized Trump's 'bombastic rhetoric.'”\n\n“The uncertainty and chaos created by the tariff dynamics between us and our allies is an impediment to growth,” he said at a conference. \n\nSuddenly, it seems Griffin sees tariffs as absolutely “the most important business issue.” \n\nBut don’t feel sorry for him, he still thinks Musk is wonderful and doing the right thing destroying our government. He’s a horrible person, and the best we can hope for is that Trump’s actions decimate his business. \n\nThis is from a now-deleted post on a subreddit for federal workers: \n\nA Betrayal of Sacrifice: A Veteran's Plea for Dignity\n\nThese past four weeks have been devastating.\n\nLast week, I sat in my car, waiting for my little girl to get out of school, and I cried. I served this country in Iraq, Afghanistan, and East Africa. When I came home, I struggled to make ends meet. No one was hiring a gunner. Eventually, I decided to use my GI Bill-not just for an education, but because I needed the extra cash. During that time, I earned my degree and landed a federal job. I was the first in my family to earn a degree and the first to work for the federal government.\n\nI loved my job. It was advertised as remote work, which made it possible for me to do my job well.\n\nGetting in and out of my car with a wheelchair is exhausting, and parking is always a hassle.\n\nWorking from home gave me some relief in a life that has been anything but easy.\n\nThen I saw the Return to Office Executive Order, and I knew it was going to get worse. I was right. The past few weeks have been nothing short of terrifying. I fear for my family. I fear for myself. I'd be lying if I said I hadn't had dark thoughts-thoughts I don't want to have. I was told I had to return to the office. I was told my reasonable accommodation would no longer be authorized. I feel betrayed-by this country, by this government. I gave everything, and now I feel like I have nothing left to give.\n\nThis, I pray.\n\nIn a subsequent post, the user noted that he was fired, a victim of Elon Musk’s purge. Heartbreaking, for sure. I take no joy in someone losing their job or the difficulties they suffer from a service-related disability. I was a soldier; my son is a soldier. I feel kindred spirits with all service members and veterans. I know the toll it can take on oneself and one’s family. \n\nBut in other posts, this guy also wrote: \n\nI love orange man now he defines a true American with his flaws and all as no one is perfect but it's not about being perfect it's about ones love of the country and doing your best to help your country first then focus on others instead of focusing on others and then your country\n\nIn another thread, when a user asked for gay-bar recommendations around the University of Maryland campus, he responded with a “ewwwwwww.” When called out on it by other users, he answered with “it’s an opinion don’t like it move to China.” \n\nIn yet another post, he wrote, “How did everyone celebrate the historic Gulf of America Day? It's rough out there but at least we got Gulf of America Day. How did you all celebrate this day, a day bugger [sic] than the Super bowl?”\n\nHe hates the foreigners and the gays and he voted for Trump to hurt those people. But Trump also hates wounded veterans, the disabled, and anyone working in the government. And you know what else? Being a disabled veteran made him a beneficiary of diversity, equity, and includes programs, or DEI. \n\nThis vet let his hatred of others blind him to how Trump wouldn’t hurt just them. And now his vote cost him and his family dearly. \n\nMaybe this guy is reachable, maybe not. Once challenged on his Trump support and posting history, he deleted both the post and his account. \n\nBut we don’t have to reach all of them. If we can swing 10% of Trump voters our way, that’s nearly 8 million voters. Heck, a 5% swing would make it hard for Republicans to keep the White House in 2028. \n\nIt’s a long way to go, and there’s plenty of time for people to become disillusioned and disenchanted.","summary":"This is an occasional roundup of people who voted for Donald Trump and are shocked to find out no one is immune from the damage and pain he causes.

Griffin, a major donor to the Republican Party, told The New York Times in December that he voted for Trump and wasn’t worried about tariffs:\n\nMr. Griffin downplayed one of the biggest concerns about Trumponomics—that tariffs could dent growth and accelerate inflation. He said it remained unclear whether Mr. Trump’s threats to slap tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China would materialize, adding that the talk of tariffs imposed by the United States was “small ball compared to the role that the world is looking to us for.” He said he didn’t see tariffs as the most important business issue.\n\nFast forward just a month and a half later:\n\n“Ken Griffin, founder of investment firm Citadel, warned Tuesday that President Donald Trump's tariff policies pose a serious risk to America's economic growth,” reported the Daily Mail, a tabloid based in the United Kingdom. “He said they may force other countries to find new trade alliances, as he criticized Trump's 'bombastic rhetoric.'”\n\n“The uncertainty and chaos created by the tariff dynamics between us and our allies is an impediment to growth,” he said at a conference. \n\nSuddenly, it seems Griffin sees tariffs as absolutely “the most important business issue.” \n\nBut don’t feel sorry for him, he still thinks Musk is wonderful and doing the right thing destroying our government. He’s a horrible person, and the best we can hope for is that Trump’s actions decimate his business. \n\nThis is from a now-deleted post on a subreddit for federal workers: \n\nA Betrayal of Sacrifice: A Veteran's Plea for Dignity\n\nThese past four weeks have been devastating.\n\nLast week, I sat in my car, waiting for my little girl to get out of school, and I cried. I served this country in Iraq, Afghanistan, and East Africa. When I came home, I struggled to make ends meet. No one was hiring a gunner. Eventually, I decided to use my GI Bill-not just for an education, but because I needed the extra cash. During that time, I earned my degree and landed a federal job. I was the first in my family to earn a degree and the first to work for the federal government.\n\nI loved my job. It was advertised as remote work, which made it possible for me to do my job well.\n\nGetting in and out of my car with a wheelchair is exhausting, and parking is always a hassle.\n\nWorking from home gave me some relief in a life that has been anything but easy.\n\nThen I saw the Return to Office Executive Order, and I knew it was going to get worse. I was right. The past few weeks have been nothing short of terrifying. I fear for my family. I fear for myself. I'd be lying if I said I hadn't had dark thoughts-thoughts I don't want to have. I was told I had to return to the office. I was told my reasonable accommodation would no longer be authorized. I feel betrayed-by this country, by this government. I gave everything, and now I feel like I have nothing left to give.\n\nThis, I pray.\n\nIn a subsequent post, the user noted that he was fired, a victim of Elon Musk’s purge. Heartbreaking, for sure. I take no joy in someone losing their job or the difficulties they suffer from a service-related disability. I was a soldier; my son is a soldier. I feel kindred spirits with all service members and veterans. I know the toll it can take on oneself and one’s family. \n\nBut in other posts, this guy also wrote: \n\nI love orange man now he defines a true American with his flaws and all as no one is perfect but it's not about being perfect it's about ones love of the country and doing your best to help your country first then focus on others instead of focusing on others and then your country\n\nIn another thread, when a user asked for gay-bar recommendations around the University of Maryland campus, he responded with a “ewwwwwww.” When called out on it by other users, he answered with “it’s an opinion don’t like it move to China.” \n\nIn yet another post, he wrote, “How did everyone celebrate the historic Gulf of America Day? It's rough out there but at least we got Gulf of America Day. How did you all celebrate this day, a day bugger [sic] than the Super bowl?”\n\nHe hates the foreigners and the gays and he voted for Trump to hurt those people. But Trump also hates wounded veterans, the disabled, and anyone working in the government. And you know what else? Being a disabled veteran made him a beneficiary of diversity, equity, and includes programs, or DEI. \n\nThis vet let his hatred of others blind him to how Trump wouldn’t hurt just them. And now his vote cost him and his family dearly. \n\nMaybe this guy is reachable, maybe not. Once challenged on his Trump support and posting history, he deleted both the post and his account. \n\nBut we don’t have to reach all of them. If we can swing 10% of Trump voters our way, that’s nearly 8 million voters. Heck, a 5% swing would make it hard for Republicans to keep the White House in 2028. \n\nIt’s a long way to go, and there’s plenty of time for people to become disillusioned and disenchanted.","summary":"This is an occasional roundup of people who voted for Donald Trump and are shocked to find out no one is immune from the damage and pain he causes.

He asserted this cycle is different from past ones because, for the first time, the party in power has no concern about its opposition’s potential presidential contenders.\n\n“You can tell me about [Kentucky] Governor [Andy] Beshear or [Maryland] Governor [Wes] Moore, but in every previous cycle, I could tell you the names of people from the losing party who could run for president and would strike some fear in the hearts of the majority party,” Halperin said. “I cannot name a person like that today.”\n\n“Are they afraid of [Illinois Gov.

Kennedy Jnr was photographed monkeying around under the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office. \n\nAhh, the symbolism. Sweet innocence, the naivety of pure youth in the crucible of absolute power.\n\nThis week, when it happened again, there was some high-level nose picking.\n\nOn Wednesday, Elon Musk brought his four-year-old son X Æ A-Xii, who goes by Lil X, to the White House to give a press briefing about how he is totally not leading a less-than-covert government takeover. \n\nThroughout this, Lil X looked, by turns, bored, bewildered, on the cusp of a full-blown tanty and darn tootin’ ready for snack time. So did President Donald Trump, who was sitting inches away. Another Go-Gurt, Don-Don?\n\nIt’s the perfect image to sum up something fundamentally rotten about Trump 2.0: It’s the bro-pocalypse. The dude-mageddon is here. \n\nThis month it was revealed that when Mr Musk went to Washington in January, he did not go alone, taking with him a posse of young men ranging in ages from 19 to 25 – interns and engineers who are, with chilling velocity, dismantling the very foundations of US government while slopping sticky Monster energy drink into the gears of state and getting pizza grease all over the Constitution.\n\nIt might be Mr Trump who gets to doodle on the back of the nuclear codes when he is dead bored on the phone with the Secretary of the Treasury – yap, yap, yap about inflation – but it’s Elon Musk and his pack of boy wonders who have been given the highest level of clearance to gut US institutions.\n\nThe billionaire’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), tasked by Mr Trump with slashing spending and gutting federal bureaucracies, has already begun decimating the US government - but let us consider just a couple of Mr Musk’s kidults in his sideways coup, the boyos who sound less like masterful Oz-ish winged monkeys and more like red-pillers in need of a decent Neutrogena face wash. \n\nDon’t think skilled political operatives, think a laser tag team who are really into pick-up artistry.\n\nThere is 19-year-old Edward Coristine who is known online, charmingly, as “Big Balls”.\n\nSwoony, no?\n\nOr Marko Elez, who only temporarily found himself unemployed after the Wall Street Journal linked the 25-year-old with a social media account that had posted such choice titbits as “I was racist before it was cool”. In September last year, the account also shared, “You could not pay me to marry outside of my ethnicity”. \n\nMr Elez briefly resigned, only for Mr Musk to come out swinging and say he would rehire him. (The posts have now been deleted).\n\nTurns out the road to hell is paved with high fives. (Or should that be, heil fives?)\n\nOr take Gavin Kliger. \n\nThis week, just before 1am on Monday, the Washington office employees of the United States Agency for International Development (USAid), the world’s biggest aid agency, were sent an email telling them to work from home that day. It was sent by Mr Kliger, 25 who until last month was, according to LinkedIn, a senior software engineer in San Francisco who had logged a stint as an intern at Twitter prior to Mr Musk’s takeover.\n\nAccording to Reuters, between October last year and last month, Mr Kliger reposted social media content from white supremacist Nick Fuentes, who has become known for the heinous aphorism, “Your body, my choice”, and from self-described misogynist Andrew Tate, who is being investigated by Romanian prosecutors for human trafficking and rape charges.\n\n(He denies any wrongdoing).\n\nMr Kliger, per Reuters, also used the term “huzz”, a highly offensive term for women, online.\n\nLadies, form an orderly queue now. And please BYO white hood.\n\nWhat that Lil X photo op, what the installation of these bro-tenants in the highest levels of Washington spell out, is that Trump 2.0 isn’t just about the execrable abuse of power for personal gain, but it’s about the surging of a poisonous, horrifyingly regressive masculinity.\n\nThe revolution will smell like Lynx Africa.\n\nAnd it goes beyond Mr Musk’s braggadocious bro-squad.\n\nWhen Mr Trump picked a running mate last year it was JD Vance, who used one of his first major interviews to take aim at “childless cat ladies”.\n\nWhen Mr Trump was inaugurated on January 20, the scene inside the US Capitol building was like a real life revenge of the billionaire-creatine-chugging nerds. Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Google co-founder Sergey Brin, TikTok chief executive Shou Zi Chew, Sam Altman of OpenAI and Dara Khosrowshahi of Uber all got primo seats. \n\nThe geeks who could never get dates in high school had officially inherited the earth.\n\n(This is not just about political expediency or keeping the big boys in Washington sweet. In January, Zuckerberg, the formerly hoodie-clad boy genius, was a guest on Joe Rogan’s testosterone-oozing podcast and said, “Masculine energy, I think, is good”).\n\nAlso prominently featured at Mr Trump’s coronation last month – all that was missing were some Beckham-esque gold thrones borrowed from a Floridian prop rental firm – were YouTuber turned boxer Jake Paul and his brother Logan, who it turns out is a wrestler and, of course, an influencer too; mixed martial arts fighter Conor McGregor, who days earlier was accused in civil court of trying to rape a woman (McGregor denies the claim), and the Ultimate Fighting Championship chief executive Dana White.\n\nWhat this scene inside Washington’s Rotunda made explicitly clear was that this bulked up, corrosive brand of hyper masculinity is no longer just something that lives in the corners of the internet, a nesting ground for disenfranchised Lonely Boys, but has long since oozed into the political mainstream.\n\nMAGAland, in case it was not perfectly clear, and Trump Two: More Fast, More Furious, More Fake Tan, is all about men.\n\nEvery political pundit worth their New Yorker subscription has, since Kamala Harris’ loss last year, eagerly pointed out that it was the manosphere that got Mr Trump elected.\n\nConsider what was happening this time around in 2017. The 500,000 women who marched on Washington, the sea of pink pussycat hats, the Resistance always spelt with a capital ‘R’.\n\nFormer President Joe Biden named the most women ever to his cabinet; Mr Trump has four – out of 24.\n\nMr Musk taking Lil X to the White House wasn’t just about using his child as a prop to perhaps soften his image and to humanise him, but it was also deeply symbolic. \n\nThe Tesla founder has daughters too, but where were they? \n\nIt is Lil X and his brothers who will inherit the earth that Trumpism is trying to wreak.\n\nDaniela Elser is a writer, editor and a commentator with more than 15 years’ experience working with a number of Australia’s leading media titles","summary":"At first glance, it seemed like a sweet moment - “First Buddy” Elon Musk taking his young son to work.

But, as massive comedy nerds, we thought we'd look back at the sketches that have stayed with us as fans, and the moments that influenced comedy and culture worldwide.\n\nBefore anyone says \"won't someone think of the musical guests?\" Yes, the 50 years of SNL has been littered with groundbreaking performances, from Sinead O'Connor ripping up a picture of Pope John Paul II (and receiving a lifetime ban), or Ashlee Simpson tanking her own career.\n\nBut for today, it's all about the comedy.\n\nThe Muppets — 1975\n\nI was somewhat surprised to discover childhood fave The Muppets were once foul-mouthed characters on Saturday Night Live.\n\nAfter creating a series of delightful fuzzy characters for Sesame Street, Jim Henson was determined not to be pigeonholed as just a children's entertainer. So he came up with something a little more… grown-up.\n\nThe Land of Gorch was a series of sketches across the very first season of SNL, in 1975. It followed the lives of a Muppet royal family in a faraway land but, in keeping with the late-night vibes, they were foul-mouthed and made frequent references to drugs and alcohol.\n\nThe segment was a notorious flop. As well as audience skepticism about puppet humour, Writers Guild of America rules meant only SNL staff writers could contribute to scripts. This meant Henson wasn't able to execute his vision, and also bred resentment among the staff who didn't want to \"write for felt\".\n\nThe Land of Gorch didn't live past the first season, but it provided inspiration and momentum for The Muppet Show, which was picked up in 1976 and introduced the world to Miss Piggy and Kermit.\n\n— Katherine Smyrk\n\nEddie Murphy's Celebrity Hot Tub Party — 1983\n\nBeloved actor and comedian Eddie Murphy is often credited with saving SNL during a rough ratings patch that followed the brief departure of creator Lorne Michaels in the early 1980s (he returned in 1985).\n\nGetting his start on the program at just 19 years old, Murphy's highlights include the light-fingered Mr Robinson — his twist on the beloved children’s TV host Mr Rogers — and his mockumentary-style video sketch Mr White, where he dressed up in whiteface and playfully explored white privilege.\n\nBut he's perhaps most remembered for impersonating comedy legend James Brown.\n\nSeason 9, in 1983, featured a sketch called Celebrity Hot Tub Party, where Murphy gives his all in an energetic impression of the iconic 60s musician and dancer, stripping right down to his golden speedos.\n\nMurphy's recurring impression of the singer was so uncanny that Brown even suggested he should play him in a biopic.\n\n— Rachel Rasker\n\nWayne's World — 1989\n\nIn my family, the first Wayne's World movie is a sacred text. We couldn't tell you any lines from an actual sacred text like The Bible, but we can recite Wayne's gun rack quote like scripture. Ahem…\n\n\"A gun rack. I don't even own a gun, let alone many guns that would necessitate an entire rack. What am I gonna do with a gun rack?\" Amen.\n\nLike the Blues Brothers before it, the origins of Garth and Wayne go all the way back to Studio 8H, when they debuted on SNL's 14th season in 1989. The bones of the movie are there: two hip SoCal stoner types have a lo-fi public access show. In their debut sketch they interview a local business owner who turns out to be Garth's dad. Party on.\n\nThe idea of extrapolating an entire low-budget comedy film from a series of six-minute sketches feels like a relic of a bygone era, but Lorne Michaels and co did it twice with a 50/50 hit rate. Not bad. Most excellent.\n\n— James Brennan\n\nThe Chanukah Song — 1994\n\nOne of the great things about SNL is looking back at the many, many, MANY stars that got their first leg-up in studio 8H.\n\nAnd one of those rising stars (for better or worse) was Adam Sandler, who was an official featured player in his early 20s. While his impressions were nothing to write home about, he really excelled behind the weekend update desk, first as the dramatic Opera Man and then with his iconic 1994 performance of 'The Chanukah Song'.\n\nI was born a year after Sandler first performed this on SNL, so my first introduction to it was through my Dad's crackly car speakers as Sandler rattled off the names of people who I did not know who also happened to be Jewish. But the tune and Sandler's playful delivery had me so hooked I still frequently revisit the song to this day (I know most of the name-checked people now, not to brag).\n\nSure, he might have created some of the worst comedy films around but, thanks to SNL, we can always revisit a brighter time when Adam Sandler was young, upcoming and, yeah, I'm gonna say it, hot.\n\n— Velvet Winter\n\nMore Cowbell — (2000)\n\nEven with a revered acting career that spans more than seven decades, Christopher Walken has said on many occasions that no performance of his has followed him around more than the SNL Cowbell sketch.\n\nOn Late Night with Conan O'Brien in 2020 he recalled being at a restaurant in Singapore when a couple called out to him \"I think my salad needs more cowbell!\"\n\nThe sketch, written by Will Ferrell, sees Walken play fictional 70s music producer Bruce Dickinson, who has been called upon to record hit song '(Don't Fear) The Reaper' by (real) rock band Blue Oyster Cult. Ferrell plays Gene, the band's overzealous cowbell player (also fictional), who disrupts the recording several times.\n\nBut what truly makes the sketch is Walken's brilliant delivery of iconic lines, such as the immortal \"I've got a fever. And the only prescription is more cowbell!\" Ferrell really steers things off the rails, causing the cast (most notably Jimmy Fallon) to break character and laugh several times.\n\nYou can watch this sketch over and over and it'll never stop being funny. And it will never stop haunting poor Christopher Walken.\n\nGotta have more cowbell, baby!\n\n— Christian Harimanow\n\nPoliticians in SNL — 2000-present\n\nImpersonating political figures of the day is very standard and important fare for any comedy show worth their salt, and SNL has embraced it wholeheartedly over the years.\n\nWill Ferrell's impersonation of George W Bush in 2000 had the former US President convinced he had actually said the word \"strategery\" while debating with Al Gore.\n\nWe've had Fred Armisen as Barack Obama and Larry David as Bernie Sanders. Maya Rudolph perfectly embodied Kamala Harris, with Andy Samberg at her side as a simpering Doug.\n\nTina Fey's impersonation of Alaskan senator and 2008 vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin won the actor and comedian a Primetime Emmy (Amy Poehler as an enraged Hillary Clinton is also worthy imo).\n\nKate McKinnon — who was also the first out lesbian in the SNL cast — is a particular master at transforming herself. The MVP of the Barbie film is not only an effortless Elizabeth Warren, she has also morphed into former attorney-general Jeff Sessions and, most hysterically, Rudy Giuliani.\n\nA special shout-out must go to Melissa McCarthy as Trump's former White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, and Sarah Saltman as former congressman and alleged statutory rapist Matt Gaetz — both of these jump-scares still haunt my dreams.\n\n— Katherine Smyrk\n\nThe Lonely Island — 2005\n\nFrom Dick in a Box to Jizz In My Pants and I'm On A Boat, the music of comedy troupe The Lonely Island (SNL cast member Andy Samberg and writers Jorma Taccone and Akiva Schaffer) was on the lips of every young person in the late 2000s/early 2010s.\n\nBut beyond giving teens grotty things to yell out in class, did you know that The Lonely Island changed the internet forever with their second digital short?\n\nBack in 2005, The Lonely Island boys wrote and performed a skit called Lazy Sunday, which featured Samberg and SNL cast mate Chris Parnell rapping about their perfect Sabbath day, including cupcakes and catching a screening of The Chronicles of Narnia.\n\nThe sketch just happened to debut on broadcast TV the same week a brand new video-sharing website was launched: YouTube, maybe you've heard of it?\n\nSNL fans jumped on the clip, uploading multiple unofficial versions that clocked a cumulative 5 million views in just a few days, making it one of the very first examples of a viral video.\n\nSo, next time you're enjoying a Vine or cute cat compilation. throw some thanks to the three boys and multiple internet pirates that made it possible.\n\n— Velvet Winter\n\nStefon on Weekend Update — 2010\n\nOn Saturday Night Live, there are three constants: a celebrity host, a musical guest and Weekend Update. The latter is extremely fertile ground for oddball freaks to look down the barrel of the camera and flourish. Enter Stefon, created by Bill Hader and then writing partner John Mulaney.\n\nStefon is the type of character that could only really find its footing in the pressure cooker environment of a weekly live sketch show. Having originally appeared in a failed sketch alongside Ben Affleck in 2008, the weirdo \"club kid\" was then plonked on Update two years later as a way to fill time.\n\nStefon segments go as follows: Weekend Update host Seth Meyers brings him out to introduce \"family-friendly\" events for tourists in New York. Stefon then describes completely absurd and hedonistic watering holes that would probably make tourists either cry or puke.\n\nBut there's a meta element in every Stefon sketch that takes the segment from good to classic. Between dress rehearsal and air, then staff writer Mulaney would swap out lines with new jokes that Hader hadn't seen. Hader has described himself as a \"light touch\" when it comes to breaking live on air, and Mulaney knew exactly how to push his buttons in the best ways possible.\n\n— James Brennan\n\nLiza Minnelli Tries to Turn Off a Lamp — 2012\n\nKristen Wiig is among SNL's all-time best physical comedians, with an elasticity that lets her scrunch her face and body to suit any impersonation or original oddball. Her Liza Minnelli — a broad brushstroke that's all jittery energy, slurred words and absurd poses, but clearly made with love for Liza — is a perfect show of her talents.\n\nIn this sketch, Liza and a friend are off to a Broadway production of Cats — but first, Liza has to turn off a lamp at her apartment. Cue the jazz drums, as Wiig slinks around trying various dance moves to turn it off while offering nonsensical one-liners punctuated by sharp horns and jazz hands.\n\nHost Jonah Hill plays a perfect straight man to Wiig, suggesting Minnelli's absurd behaviour is part and parcel of being her friend. He's never irritated as he repeatedly, across the four minutes, suggests she simply find the switch.\n\nWarning: Once you watch this, there's a high chance that \"Will a Fosse neck do it?\" will enter your regular lexicon.\n\n– Jared Richards\n\nThe arrival of Sarah Sherman — 2021\n\nEvery now and then, a new player lands on the show and immediately enriches it with a fresh brand of unhinged comedy. The most recent example of this is Sarah Sherman, who was performing under the moniker Sarah Squirm before landing SNL.\n\nAs her stage name would suggest, this lady is the ruler of gross-out humour. Her on-air sketches have included sentient, singing meatballs that grow out of her skin, an impromptu infomercial for the \"Glamgina\" make-up kit at a gynaecology check-up, and a business meeting where she reveals she has replaced her eyes with plastic googly ones.\n\nMuch like Hader's Stefon, Sherman shines brightest when she's brought to the Weekend Update desk to unleash chaos on the unsuspecting host. Her first Update feature had her laying verbal traps for Colin Jost in an attempt to \"gotcha\" him with unflattering headlines. These poked fun at his Hamptons home, his famous wife and overall \"white Harvard guy\" vibe.\n\nThis angle has pretty much become a staple of Colin Jost's stint as Weekend Update host, with writers and other cast members expanding the premise to hilarious heights.\n\n— James Brennan","summary":"For the past half-century, US sketch show Saturday Night Live has defied the odds, delivering weekly live shows and lifting up some of the most famous comedy creators in history.","url":"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-02-16/saturday-night-live-turns-50/104937364","image":"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/7b81786356c09f4ff7b16baf99f1cd34?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=692&cropW=1230&xPos=0&yPos=66&width=862&height=485","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-15 19:25:48","author":"Jared Richards","authors":["Jared Richards"],"language":"en","source_country":"AU","sentiment":0.567},{"id":290890478,"title":"What would a Harris-Walz administration be doing right now?","text":"“With this mandate, I’m here to ensure the hopes, dreams, and aspirations of the American people!” the president-elect ensured during her victory speech. \n\nFULL LIST OF EXECUTIVE ORDERS, ACTIONS, AND PROCLAMATIONS TRUMP HAS MADE AS PRESIDENT\n\nFor many pundits and pollsters, this hypothetical was a very real possibility going into Election Day. Forecasters from Nate Silver to Larry Sabato to FiveThirtyEight, and pundits from Bill Kristol to James Carville to Joe Scarborough all had Harris winning. \n\nIn the end, 48.4% of America actually did vote for Harris, while Trump clinched the race by less than two points in Pennsylvania, about 1.6 points in Michigan, and less than one point in Wisconsin. It was that close, just as it was in 2016 and 2020. \n\nOne can’t help wondering what the world would look like heading into President’s Day Weekend 2025 if the former vice president and her goofy running mate, Tim Walz, were actually elected. \n\nHere’s a glimpse into this alternate reality. \n\nJanuary 20, 2025: After being sworn in, President Harris signs several executive orders, including one giving transgender athletes the right to dominate, er, compete against biological women in sports. She also signs one that declared Twitter/X would now be monitored under the government’s new “Hate Speech Task Force” in an effort to thwart white nationalism and misinformation. \n\nAs for her Cabinet, Kamala declares that the Senate, “must put Democracy over party” and confirm all her nominees to “ensure the smooth transition of government.”\n\nHer team includes: \n\nChief of Staff: Alex Soros\n\nSecretary of State: Susan Rice \n\nDefense Secretary: Liz Cheney \n\nPress Secretary: Don Lemon \n\nAttorney General: Letitia James \n\nFEMA Director: Gavin Newsom \n\nDHS Secretary: Beto O’Rourke \n\nLabor Secretary: Bernie Sanders \n\nTreasury Secretary: Elizabeth Warren \n\nVeterans Affairs: Richard Blumenthal \n\nHealth and Human Services (HHS) Director: Dr. Anthony Fauci\n\nSecretary of Education: Randi Weingarten\n\nDirector of National Intelligence: Adam Kinzinger\n\nHate Speech Task Force Czar: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez \n\nFor the first three weeks of the Harris presidency, the goal, despite running as the change candidate, is to continue as much of the Biden agenda as possible. Status quo and “play it safe” is the unwritten mantra. \n\nAid to Ukraine continues to go unabated and without any accountability on how exactly the money was being spent. \n\n“We must continue to do whatever it takes to keep the fight against Russian aggression going, unburdened by what has been,” Harris declares in pre-written remarks before hurrying from the podium without taking questions from reporters. \n\nIn fact, Kamala’s handlers advise her not to do a press conference or take any questions outside of controlled environments in any capacity. \n\n“Why President Harris Doesn’t Have to Take Questions From the Press,” is the “news analysis” piece that runs on the front page of the New York Times on Groundhog Day 2025, ironically. \n\nIn Gaza, Hamas continues to hold all hostages. \n\nOn the U.S. Southern Border, illegal migrants begin pouring into the country after Harris signs an Executive Order lifting Joe Biden’s order from June 2024 that limited asylum eligibility. \n\n“The Statue of Liberty has always been a beacon of hope to the world for people to send their people to this country,” deputy White House press secretary Jim Acosta explains. It isn’t clear exactly what the legal immigration process has to do with the illegal variety, but that’s what the White House goes with, driving Sunny Hostin to tears on The View. \n\nMeanwhile, violent gangs of illegals from Central and South America continue to expand their caliphate from New York to Chicago to Aurora, Colorado. “Just a few apartment complexes,” in the infamous words of ABC’s Martha Raddatz, become block after block, all while exhausted police forces with shrinking budgets (due to perpetually housing and feeding illegals in their cities). \n\nOn the economic front, one of President Harris’s big campaign promises is kept after she signs an Executive Order to end “price gouging” at grocery stores. Of course, the average profit margin at almost every grocery store is less than two percent, and sure … this gambit has failed miserably from everywhere from Cuba to Venezuela to the old Soviet Union, but thanks to the urging of Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, it becomes a reality. \n\nSeveral months later, however, an actual price gouging bill fails to even make it to the floor of the House, with several Democrats and multiple Republicans opposing it. This becomes a common theme throughout President Harris’s first term. \n\nEfforts to expand the U.S. to 52 states by adding DC and Puerto Rico as U.S. states fail.\n\nA plan to tax unrealized capital gains also gets shot down, with the effort led by a rogue Nancy Pelosi. \n\nOther lowlights include:\n\nFormer President Trump is sentenced in his so-called hush money case in New York and sent to a minimum-security prison, making the country even more hopelessly divided. \n\nGovernment waste and corruption continue to go not only unabated, but actually expand.\n\nAmerica is declared a “sanctuary country.” \n\nEV mandates become federalized. \n\nVoting laws are federalized. The 2028 presidential election isn’t called until after Christmas as a result. \n\nCRT is federally mandated to be taught in public schools, per Education Secretary Randi Weingarten. \n\nBiological men posing as women post topless videos on social media during an LGBTQ+ Pride party on the South Lawn of the White House. (Wait, that already happened under Biden-Harris). \n\nAnd at Vice President Walz’s direction, both tampons and condom machines are made available in all schools in girls’ and boys’ bathrooms across the U.S.\n\nThankfully, in the name of common sense, this alternate universe never left the fiction aisle. \n\nDonald Trump won for two reasons: (1) Most of his policy positions are all in lockstep with what the majority of the American people want, namely on taxes, spending, cutting government waste, crime, immigration and foreign policy. Trump also had a track record that made enough voters believe his campaign promises would come to fruition (and thus far, they are); and (2) Kamala Harris simply came across as an inauthentic person who would say just about anything to get elected and therefore wasn’t believable. \n\nA Harris presidency would have also posed the same question that dogged the Biden presidency: Who exactly is running the country? Is it Obama? Ron Klain? Susan Rice? The Soros family? Or someone we aren’t even considering?\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nLooking ahead, polls show she’s the front-runner to be the Democratic nominee in an attempt to become the nation’s 48th president. \n\nIf you’re a Republican, that’s a non-fictional scenario absolutely worth rooting for.","summary":"The final swing state had come in for Kamala Harris in the early morning of Nov. 6.

If Harris decides to run for California governor in 2026, Trump is reportedly preparing a counter-strategy, setting the stage for another political battle between them.Kamala Harris’ potential return to California politicsAfter losing the 2024 presidential election to Trump, Kamala Harris has moved back to California. With Governor Gavin Newsom being term-limited in 2026, speculation is growing about her possible candidacy. According to internal polling reported by The Hollywood Reporter (THR), Harris would be the frontrunner in a California governor's race. Despite her national defeat, she remains widely popular in the state.Other contenders are also eyeing the race. Billionaire Rick Caruso, who lost the 2022 Los Angeles mayoral election to Karen Bass despite spending $104 million of his own funds, is seen as a potential challenger. However, political experts suggest that Harris would have a significant advantage due to her strong name recognition and past electoral success in California.Also Read: Is Cristiano Ronaldo joining Manchester United for a shock third stint?

Grenell has experience in California politics, having worked as a spokesman for former San Diego Mayor Susan Golding and advising local campaigns. His connections could help the Republican Party put up a strong fight.The political landscape in California has also shifted slightly. The handling of the Los Angeles wildfires in January has hurt the reputation of state Democrats, including Mayor Karen Bass. This has opened the door for challengers like Caruso and other Trump-backed candidates to gain traction.Kamala Harris’ 2028 Presidential prospectsWhile Harris has not officially announced her candidacy for governor, Democratic insiders expect her to run for president again in 2028. A January poll from McLaughlin & Associates showed Harris leading the Democratic primary race with 33%, ahead of Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg at 9% and Governor Gavin Newsom at 7%.If Harris wins the California governorship, it could strengthen her position for a 2028 presidential run, following a path similar to Richard Nixon.

The one place that I would say that we need to really change policies is the snap program and food stamps and in school lunches - because there the federal government is, in many cases, paying for it and we shouldn't be subsidizing people to eat poison.\"This snippet of the interview has been shared multiple times on X, formerly Twitter, with some people, often supporters of the Democratic Party, referencing Obama's campaign and the criticism it attracted.These people include CNN's chief media correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta, who said Thursday that the MAHA movement \"frankly had a lot of echoes of what we've heard in the past from the Let's Move campaign, from Michelle Obama, for example, but that had broad support - trying to make people healthier.\"\"We spend a lot of money on healthcare, we don't see enough in return for those dollars,\" he added.Progressive writer and commentator Matthew Sheffield wrote on X on Friday: \"Republicans hated Michelle Obama for improving school lunches as the 'nanny state.'\"Former Minnesota GOP Representative Michele Bachmann accused Obama of trying to implement a \"nanny state\" in 2011, after a push to get mothers to breastfeed their babies as part of her campaign. Bachmann told The Laura Ingraham Show at the time: \"For them, government is the answer to every problem.\"In 2010, the year that the \"Let's Move\" campaign was launched, conservative media personality Glenn Beck responded to Obama's appeal to the National Restaurant Association to \"create healthier versions of the foods that we all love\" and offer \"healthy sides\" so that fries are \"something customers have to request.\"\"Get your damn hands off my fries, lady. If I want to be a fat, fat, fatty and shovel French fries all day long, that is my choice...,\" he said.Ingraham put this issue to RFK Jr. this week when he spoke about reducing the number of legal additives in the U.S., asking: \"Is that not a nanny state?

With the 2024 election — and the elite-media interference that accompanied it — behind us, the legacy press has shifted from protecting the Democratic Party to attacking it in certain cases. Three books on liberal media bias explain why the media elite’s misinformation machine may never cease.\n\n Though it’s nearly 25 years old, Bernard Goldberg’s “Bias” remains a valuable resource. It was one of the first books to address this issue and gets to the heart of the problem within the journalism industry. The book, subtitled “A CBS Insider Exposes How the Media Distort the News,” recounts Goldberg’s experience as a 28-year veteran reporter at CBS. He was fired after airing complaints to the Wall Street Journal about CBS’ growing leftward drift, including that of his boss, Dan Rather.\n\n There is no fairness, balance, or impartiality — only straight advocacy for a hard-left agenda.\n\n Goldberg recalls his years at CBS and elsewhere, noting that the industry attracts people who want to “change the world.” Conservatives, who value religion, heritage, nation, and family and generally do not seek to upend ancient institutions, are unlikely to fit this mold. This might explain what a friend recently told me: his graduating class of 100 at a top journalism school had about “two and a half conservatives,” himself included.\n\n Goldberg writes that these “change the world” types don’t see themselves as biased when attacking conservative policies or opinions. They view their preferences as simply “common sense” — a phrase Rather used in a conversation with Goldberg. But considering how sheltered journalists’ lives are, far removed from 99% of America, the question is: common with whom?\n\n Goldberg notes that his colleagues were fine with lying to their audience if they believed it would draw attention to an important cause and lead to “positive change.” One example of what he calls a “noble embellishment” involved reporters in the 1980s and '90s attempting to portray heterosexuals as equally susceptible to AIDS. This tactic, designed to alarm straight people, ignored the reality that AIDS was primarily a problem among gay males. Goldberg points to an article headlined “40% of AIDS sufferers are heterosexual.” But the story failed to acknowledge that most of the 40% were intravenous drug users, with few actually contracting the disease through heterosexual sex.\n\n “Bias” does an excellent job of exposing media do-gooders’ moral blindness. Goldberg recounts how Rather and his colleagues were furious after he accused CBS News of bias in the Wall Street Journal. One of them even compared reading the piece to discovering his wife had been raped. Such sensitivity is, of course, rich coming from an industry that supposedly supports whistleblowers and whose entire existence revolves around interfering with other industries — never mind invading people's private lives. Consider former Washington Post reporter Taylor Lorenz, who cried after being criticized for doxxing the social media influencer \"Libs of TikTok.\"\n\nManufacturing discontent\n\n Matt Taibbi’s 2019 book “Hate, Inc.” also exposes the media’s hypocritical oversensitivity. While on the campaign trail in 2004, for example, Taibbi recalls receiving a complaint from the Washington Post’s Howard Kurtz after apparently breaking an unwritten rule by taking video of the press section without permission. Once again, the media establishment feels aggrieved over something it does all the time.\n\n Taibbi’s book, subtitled “Why Today’s Media Makes Us Despise One Another,” shifts from the media’s fake alarmism over liberal causes to the newer, more damaging phenomenon of “manufacturing discontent” between Republicans and Democrats. Taibbi describes this as “selling siloed anger” to attract more clicks and views. He writes that today’s mass-media consumer is often given content that simply confirms their prejudices, “about whatever or whoever the villains of the day happened to be: foreigners, minorities, terrorists, the Clintons, Republicans, even corporations.”\n\n Taibbi harshly criticizes figures like Sean Hannity and Rachel Maddow (each featured on his book’s cover). He especially criticizes Maddow, a former friend, for pushing the “Russiagate” conspiracy theory to cope with Donald Trump’s 2016 win. Taibbi’s friend Glenn Greenwald has commented on the seriousness of pushing such a pernicious lie, noting that it likely still fuels Democrats’ bloodlust for Russia’s defeat in its conflict with Ukraine.\n\nIt’s all activism now\n\n Outlets like Maddow’s MSNBC essentially sell a “consumer product” to people, Taibbi notes. They offer viewers a “political safe space” that aligns with a specific political party. Media studies professor Andrey Mir explores this in his 2020 book “Postjournalism and the Death of Newspapers,” where he details how the media’s business model has changed in the post-internet era, altering how news is selected and reported.\n\n Previously, leftist media analysts like Noam Chomsky argued that the establishment press skewed coverage to placate the wealthy elite (advertisers’ most coveted demographic). Now, the press skews coverage to cater to its activist readership. With advertisers moving to more efficient technologies like Facebook and Google — which control 80% of the advertising market — newspapers have turned to what Mir calls paid-up “members” and donors for revenue. These people, like everyone else, can read the news online for free but choose to give their money to outlets because they like what they say.\n\n Treating such outlets as advocacy groups, Mir explains, means that only the largest publications — such as the New York Times and the Washington Post, the ones most capable of spreading the message — will attract support. What these “advocacy group members” are paying for, then, is not just to stay informed, but to push the outlet’s message and shape public opinion in the way they want it to be.\n\n Previously beholden to corporate advertisers (again, Chomsky’s view), the legacy press is now dependent on the activists who fund it. As a result, daily story selection is driven by “the most resonating pressing social issues that could justify fundraising and stimulate readers to donate.” This process incentivizes journalism to “mutate into propaganda.” There is no fairness, balance, or impartiality — only straight advocacy for a hard-left agenda.\n\n What it means for “save-the-world” types to now work for other “save-the-world” types is that expectations for the elite media to change should be even lower. To any conservative expecting the corporate left-wing media to come to their senses after Kamala Harris’ recent defeat and perhaps reduce their bias: It’s unlikely to happen any time soon.","summary":"Liberal bias in the legacy press is nothing new, but conservatives rarely delve into the “how” and “why” behind it all.

Hawley supporting pro-union legislation","text":"He was the first president to walk a picket line. And he crowed regularly about being the “most pro-union” president ever. But after four years as president, Joe Biden could not stop a growing working-class coalition, one that increasingly includes rank-and-file union members, from flocking to Donald Trump.\n\nReflecting on election night about the coalition that returned him to the White House, Trump called it “a historic realignment.” John McLaughlin wondered if it would endure.\n\nWhile Republicans celebrated in the weeks after the election, Trump’s longtime pollster looked to the future.\n\n“Right now, these Trump voters – the GOP is just renting them,” McLaughlin told RealClearPolitics. Speaking of the coalition Trump cobbled together consisting of disaffected Democrats and traditionally liberal constituencies, he added that Republicans “need to make a decision if they’re going to make them permanent.”\n\nEnter Sen. Josh Hawley, the Missouri Republican emerging as the right-of-center pro-labor leader.\n\n“Look at what Donald Trump achieved. He achieved victory based on this coalition, and he deserves tremendous credit for making it possible, and he knows it,” Hawley said in an interview before picking up where Trump’s pollster left off. Hawley is asking his Republican colleagues whether they want their new-found working-class support “to begin and end with Donald Trump.”\n\nHis framework for pro-union legislation amounts to something of a downpayment. It is a set of proposals to reform the way businesses interact with organized labor, from requiring worker rights to be displayed on a job site to prohibiting “unsafe work speed quotas.” And soon Hawley will introduce legislation mandating accelerated negotiations between unions and employers.\n\nA 2022 Bloomberg Law analysis found that the average time between workers voting to unionize and reaching their first contract with employers was 465 days. The Hawley bill would mandate that once workers vote to form a union, the employer and employees must begin the negotiations process within 10 days. It is a significant reform, which unions have wanted for years. Two Democrats have already promised to co-sponsor: Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Gary Peters of Michigan. But its author is unusual in that Hawley comes from a party traditionally more favorable to corporations than workers.\n\nHawley has embraced the heterodoxy. Last year he abandoned his support for right-to-work laws, policies which bar unions from requiring workers to pay dues as a condition of employment. Before that, Hawley introduced legislation that could have easily come from the desk of socialist firebrand Bernie Sanders. One was a bill to cap credit card interest rates; another sought to overturn the Supreme Court’s campaign finance decision, Citizens United.\n\nNeither was well-received in traditional conservative precincts. The latter earned Hawley a rebuke from the business-friendly Wall Street Journal editorial page. But Hawley represents a vanguard of a New Right, and while his bill mandating accelerated negotiations between labor and business faces an uphill battle in the Senate, skepticism of corporate power is increasingly in vogue among the GOP because of Trump’s ascendancy.\n\n“As conservatives, who are now benefiting from the support of working people, it’s time we deliver for them and bring into actuality this Trump realignment, this working-class realignment of the Republican Party,” Hawley said of his efforts. “This is my project.”\n\nIn this, the president is sympathetic. Trump delights in bragging about how he peeled union votes away from Democrats. He invited Teamsters president Sean O’Brien to address the Republican Convention in Milwaukee without any preconditions about what the union boss could or couldn’t say on stage. Later when the Teamsters declined to endorse him or former Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump portrayed the non-endorsement as a tacit repudiation of Democrats.\n\nTrump and Hawley have spoken in the days since the inauguration. A source familiar with those calls reports that the president is generally supportive of Hawley’s pro-labor legislation. A senior White House official did not dispute that characterization, telling RCP that “the president will never turn his back on union voters.”\n\nThe administration made their commitment explicit on the campaign trail where Vice President J.D. Vance often bemoaned the “tragedy” of declining union membership in the private sector.\n\n“I think what we see as our job in national policy is to protect as many workers’ jobs as possible, to promote tax and spending and tariff policies that promote large scale economic growth and actually give workers more their take on pay and more jobs to begin with,” Vance told RCP last September before adding that the incoming administration would work to make the job of unions “easier, not harder.”\n\nThis was a winning political argument. Now those voters are likely to expect results. Hawley says Republicans must embrace working class voters or, he warns, “we will never be a majority party.”\n\n“The Republican Party right now is defined largely by one very specific personality who’s been quite successful,” said Abigail Ball, executive director of the conservative think tank American Compass. “If we’re going to see this be a long-lasting realignment,” she continued, “where working class voters take seriously that conservatives want to deliver, we have to do real long-term policy work.”\n\nIf Trump exits the Oval Office in four years without overseeing any such “policy work,” Hawley fears that the GOP is at risk of “reverting to the days where we are a wholly owned subsidiary of these mega corporations.” That comes with its own familiar result: a return to what Hawley calls “the political wilderness.” There is no majority coalition there, he said, warning his party, “We know this because we’ve lived it for 30 years.”\n\nAn early test comes in the person of Trump’s nominee for labor secretary, Lori Chavez-DeRemer. She is a former member of Congress, a Democrat from Oregon with well-defined, pro-union views. Her support of the PRO Act, which would pre-empt state right-to-work laws, makes her anathema to pro-business Republicans. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul promised to oppose her and predicted she could lose as many as 15 GOP votes. Democrats like Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, meanwhile, seemed pleasantly surprised and signaled a willingness to back her. “I think she’d be terrific,” Hawley said.\n\nIf there is indeed a realignment, it is incomplete. Republicans are not as comfortable as Hawley on a picket line. They are more inclined to side with industry. And while Trump seems eager to keep union voters in the GOP fold, during his first time in office he sided with business. His judicial nominees, as well as his nominees to sit on the National Labor Relations Board, were undoubtedly labor skeptics. Trump even praised Elon Musk’s perceived penchant for firing Tesla workers interested in starting a union.\n\n“You’re the greatest cutter,” Trump told Musk during a live conversation on X. “I look at what you do. You walk in and say, ‘You want to quit?’ I won’t mention the name of the company, but they go on strike, and you say, ‘that’s OK. You’re all gone.’”\n\nThe richest man in the world, Musk is now not just a supporter but a key member of the Trump administration. The second and third richest men in the world, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook/Meta and Jeff Bezos of Amazon, attended Trump’s second inaugural. All three have, at one time or another, been caught up in lawsuits over their treatment of employees looking to unionize.\n\nThe proximity of that much capital to the president does not worry Hawley. “There’s only one person who runs the Trump administration, and as many who think otherwise, sadly, learn, that one person is Donald J. Trump,” he replied when asked about the new coziness between Silicon Valley elite and the populist president. “So I have no doubt that Jeff Bezos would love to be in the president’s inner circle,” he added. “Do I think that the president is going to ultimately listen to him? No.”\n\nThe Missouri senator would prefer if the president listened to him and helped get his latest pro-labor legislation into law. So would the Teamsters who support the new bill.\n\n“Legislation gets put forward, oftentimes, as a political chess piece and part of the game, but the ultimate result is that it doesn’t see the light of day,” said Teamsters spokeswoman Kara Deniz. Unions have watched that dynamic play out over and over again across administrations, she said. Led by O’Brien, though, the Teamsters are increasingly open to working across the partisan divide. “The priority is to wherever we can, whether it’s Democrat, Republican, or independent, to work together with any political leader that is going to support workers,” Deniz told RCP.\n\n“Hawley has been that person,” she said.","summary":"Proposals include demand for worker rights to be displayed, banning unsafe work speed quotas","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2025/02/the-realignment-gop-sen-hawley-supporting-pro-union-legislation/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/josh-hawley-republicans-jpg.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-15 17:30:16","author":"Realclear Wire,RealClearWire","authors":["Realclear Wire","RealClearWire"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.09},{"id":291058790,"title":"Barack Obama’s Savage Diaper Joke About Donald Trump Hits Him Where It Hurts!","text":"Former US President Barack Obama issued a biting assessment to his successor, Donald Trump, in Pittsburgh as he rallied for Kamala Harris in the 2024 campaign.

We are both, somehow, now 50 years old. On Sunday night, the Not Ready For Prime Time Players are throwing a birthday party (for the show, sadly not for me), live from New York. With five decades of circling the sun comes the desire to reflect upon the past, what worked and what didn’t. For SNL, and late night comedy TV writ large, what absolutely has not worked is their relatively recent, hackneyed obsequience to wokeness. JOE PISCOPO ADMITS TRUMP SUPPORT WAS ‘THE NAIL IN MY COFFIN IN HOLLYWOOD’ The problem began around the turn of the century when the flexible social strictures of political correctness were metastasizing into the cold hard rules of wokeness. Put another way, the age of \"That’s not funny,\" was ushered in. What this meant for SNL, as well as \"The Tonight Show\" and others was a kind of self-censorship that is completely anathema to comedy as well as the bizarre notion that the primary goal of a joke is not to provoke laughter, but to make society better, or something. In the case of SNL, not only has the show censored itself in the 21st Century, it has censored its own past. The best example of this is that NBC Universal has banned video of a classic skit from 1977 featuring original black cast member Garret Morris and the lighter-skinned black activist and guest host Julian Bond. In the bit, Bond plays himself on a talk show talking about how IQ tests are racially biased. Asked for an example of a biased question, Bond says, \"Question one: You have been invited over for cocktails by the officer of your trust fund. Cocktails begin at 4:30, but you must make an appearance at a 6 o'clock formal dinner at the Yacht Club. What do you do about dress?\" The whole thing is hilarious, but the reason it has been scrubbed from existence is the final punchline, in which Morris asks where the idea of black intellectual inferiority comes from, and Bond, deadpan, says it is because light-skinned blacks are smarter than dark-skinned blacks. Decades later, Bond would say the sketch made him feel uneasy, adding, \"I believed it treaded dangerously on the fine line between comedy and poor taste,\" but honestly, so what? The obvious point of the punchline is that it is ludicrous to judge a person’s intelligence based on skin color.

Many are now grappling with the consequences of their choice as it affects them and their loved ones—and possibly regretting their vote.\n\nToday, we shine spotlights on the most opposite spectrums of American society—one of the poorest countries in the country—Prentiss County, Mississippi—and billionaire Ken Griffin. And then we’ll end with a disabled veteran.\n\nLet’s start with Prentiss County. On their Facebook page, the county’s sheriff’s department announced, “Our Food giveaway is suspended until further notice. We have been notified by MidSouth Foodbank that funding has been suspended and we won’t receive any deliveries until otherwise notified.”\n\nThe letter attached to the Facebook post further clarified that the funding shortfall came, in part, from an end to COVID-19-era food assistance. Republicans have taken aim at such programs for the last couple of years, and they are as good as dead now that their party holds total control in Washington. \n\nIt is obviously distressing for a community and its poor to lose something as invaluable as food assistance. Yet the county’s voters have done everything possible to worsen their situation. \n\nThe county’s annual per-capita income is $29,000, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Nearly 18% of its residents live in poverty, similar to the state at large. The national poverty rate was 11% in 2023, the most recent year of complete data. \n\nPrentiss is 81% non-Hispanic white and 15% Black. Given that this is Mississippi, among the most racially politically polarized states in the country, it shouldn’t be surprising that President Donald Trump won the county with 82.7% of the vote to Democrat Kamala Harris’ 16.6%—almost identical to the racial makeup.\n\nNow, thanks in part to the county’s votes, federal food-assistance programs have dried up, with zero chance of them being revived—and it could soon get worse for them. Nearly 18% of Mississippi residents are enrolled in Medicaid, a program currently on the GOP’s chopping block. Also in the crosshairs are subsidized school lunches for needy kids and food stamps. \n\nTrump and billionaire Elon Musk’s assault on assistance programs is in full swing, and it will harm America’s poor more than anyone—and Prentiss is a poor county in the poorest state in the union. \n\nBut I’m sure they’ll console themselves knowing that a handful of transgender women won’t be able to compete in college sports. They really stuck it to those coastal elites! \n\nSpeaking of coastal elites, not all of them are Democrats. \n\nTake Miami-based Ken Griffin, for example. The hedge-fund CEO of Citadel LLC is No. 33 in Forbes’ list of the world’s richest people, with a net worth of $44.3 billion as of Friday. Griffin, a major donor to the Republican Party, told The New York Times in December that he voted for Trump and wasn’t worried about tariffs:\n\nMr. Griffin downplayed one of the biggest concerns about Trumponomics—that tariffs could dent growth and accelerate inflation. He said it remained unclear whether Mr. Trump’s threats to slap tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China would materialize, adding that the talk of tariffs imposed by the United States was “small ball compared to the role that the world is looking to us for.” He said he didn’t see tariffs as the most important business issue.\n\nFast forward just a month and a half later:\n\n“Ken Griffin, founder of investment firm Citadel, warned Tuesday that President Donald Trump's tariff policies pose a serious risk to America's economic growth,” reported the Daily Mail, a tabloid based in the United Kingdom. “He said they may force other countries to find new trade alliances, as he criticized Trump's 'bombastic rhetoric.'”\n\n“The uncertainty and chaos created by the tariff dynamics between us and our allies is an impediment to growth,” he said at a conference. \n\nSuddenly, it seems Griffin sees tariffs as absolutely “the most important business issue.” \n\nBut don’t feel sorry for him, he still thinks Musk is wonderful and doing the right thing destroying our government. He’s a horrible person, and the best we can hope for is that Trump’s actions decimate his business. \n\nThis is from a now-deleted post on a subreddit for federal workers: \n\nA Betrayal of Sacrifice: A Veteran's Plea for Dignity\n\nThese past four weeks have been devastating.\n\nLast week, I sat in my car, waiting for my little girl to get out of school, and I cried. I served this country in Iraq, Afghanistan, and East Africa. When I came home, I struggled to make ends meet. No one was hiring a gunner. Eventually, I decided to use my GI Bill-not just for an education, but because I needed the extra cash. During that time, I earned my degree and landed a federal job. I was the first in my family to earn a degree and the first to work for the federal government.\n\nI loved my job. It was advertised as remote work, which made it possible for me to do my job well.\n\nGetting in and out of my car with a wheelchair is exhausting, and parking is always a hassle.\n\nWorking from home gave me some relief in a life that has been anything but easy.\n\nThen I saw the Return to Office Executive Order, and I knew it was going to get worse. I was right. The past few weeks have been nothing short of terrifying. I fear for my family. I fear for myself. I'd be lying if I said I hadn't had dark thoughts-thoughts I don't want to have. I was told I had to return to the office. I was told my reasonable accommodation would no longer be authorized. I feel betrayed-by this country, by this government. I gave everything, and now I feel like I have nothing left to give.\n\nThis, I pray.\n\nIn a subsequent post, the user noted that he was fired, a victim of Elon Musk’s purge. Heartbreaking, for sure. I take no joy in someone losing their job or the difficulties they suffer from a service-related disability. I was a soldier; my son is a soldier. I feel kindred spirits with all service members and veterans. I know the toll it can take on oneself and one’s family. \n\nBut in other posts, this guy also wrote: \n\nI love orange man now he defines a true American with his flaws and all as no one is perfect but it's not about being perfect it's about ones love of the country and doing your best to help your country first then focus on others instead of focusing on others and then your country\n\nIn another thread, when a user asked for gay-bar recommendations around the University of Maryland campus, he responded with a “ewwwwwww.” When called out on it by other users, he answered with “it’s an opinion don’t like it move to China.” \n\nIn yet another post, he wrote, “How did everyone celebrate the historic Gulf of America Day? It's rough out there but at least we got Gulf of America Day. How did you all celebrate this day, a day bugger [sic] than the Super bowl?”\n\nHe hates the foreigners and the gays and he voted for Trump to hurt those people. But Trump also hates wounded veterans, the disabled, and anyone working in the government. And you know what else? Being a disabled veteran made him a beneficiary of diversity, equity, and includes programs, or DEI. \n\nThis vet let his hatred of others blind him to how Trump wouldn’t hurt just them. And now his vote cost him and his family dearly. \n\nMaybe this guy is reachable, maybe not. Once challenged on his Trump support and posting history, he deleted both the post and his account. \n\nBut we don’t have to reach all of them. If we can swing 10% of Trump voters our way, that’s nearly 8 million voters. Heck, a 5% swing would make it hard for Republicans to keep the White House in 2028. \n\nIt’s a long way to go, and there’s plenty of time for people to become disillusioned and disenchanted.","summary":"This is an occasional roundup of people who voted for Donald Trump and are shocked to find out no one is immune from the damage and pain he causes. Many are now grappling with the consequences of their choice as it affects them and their loved ones—and possibly regretting their vote.\n\n\n\n\nToday, we shine spotlights on the most opposite spectrums of American society—one of the poorest countries in the country—Prentiss County, Mississippi—and billionaire Ken Griffin.

On Presidents’ Day we reflect on thelives and legacies of all our 44 American presidents. Note that I have spelled the name of this federal holiday “Presidents’ Day,” not “President’s Day.” Why? Because the day salutes all our presidents.\n\nSeven presidents elected at intervals of 20 years died in office — William Henry Harrison (elected in 1840), Abraham Lincoln (1860), James Garfield (1880), William McKinley (1900), Warren Harding (1920), Franklin Roosevelt (1940), and John F. Kennedy (1960).First noted in a Ripley’s Believe It or Not book published in 1934, this string of untimely presidential deaths is variously known as the curse of Tippecanoe, the zero-year curse, the 20-year curse, and Tecumseh’s curse, Tecumseh being the chief of the Shawnee Nation defeated by William Henry Harrison at the Battle of Tippecanoe in 1811. Ronald Reagan, elected in 1980 and shot by John Hinckley Jr. on March 30, 1981, almost continued the deadly sequence but survived and broke the pattern.\n\nThe more we delve into the lives of our American presidents, the more we see patterns that connect their feats, their fates, and their families:\n\nExcept for Barack Obama, the publicly acknowledged ancestry of our 45 presidents has been limited to seven heritages or some combination thereof — Dutch, English, German, Irish, Scottish, Swiss, and Welsh. Barack Obama was our first president of African heritage, the son of a Kenyan father.\n\nA significant number of our presidents have been related. John Adams was the father of John Quincy Adams and George H. W. Bush the father of George W. Bush. William Henry Harrison was the grandfather of Benjamin Harrison. James Madison and Zachary Taylor were second cousins. And genealogists have determined that Franklin Roosevelt was a fifth cousin of Theodore Roosevelt and related to 11 other presidents by blood or marriage. That’s more than half our presidents closely or distantly related.\n\nVirginia is the birth state the greatest number of our presidents, including seven of the first 12 — George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, James Monroe, William Henry Harrison, John Tyler, and Zachary Taylor, as well as Woodrow Wilson. Three of those presidents — Jefferson, Madison, and Monroe — served two terms consecutively, a pattern repeated only once: Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama.\n\nOhio is known as the “Mother of Presidents” because eight American presidents were born or lived in Ohio — William Henry Harrison (who lived there when he was elected), Ulysses S. Grant, Rutherford B. Hayes, James Garfield, Benjamin Harrison, William McKinley, William Howard Taft, and Warren Harding.\n\nFive candidates for president — Andrew Jackson (1824), Samuel J. Tilden (1876),Grover Cleveland (1888), Al Gore (2000), and Hillary Clinton (2016) — won the popular vote but lost the election in the Electoral College. In other words, more than 10% of our presidents have not been elected by a majority of our voters:All five of the above candidates who lost the presidency were Democrats.\n\nOne striking pattern of the American presidency is that no woman has occupied thatoffice. It’s not that they haven’t tried:In 1872, more than 150 years ago, Virginia Woodhull, an activist in the suffrage movement, became the first woman to run for president as a member of the National EqualRights Party.\n\nFollowing the path that Woodhull blazed, other notable women also became candidates for the presidency, including Belva Lockwood (National Equal Rights Party – 1884 and 1888), Shirley Chisholm (Democrat – 1972) – first Black major-party candidate, Hillary Clinton (Democrat – 2008 and 2016) – first woman nominated by a major party, Nikki Hailey (Republican – 2024), and Kamala Harris (Democrat – 2020 and 2024).\n\nSince World War II, no major party has held the presidency for more than two consecutive terms, with the exception of Republicans Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, 1981-1993.\n\nTwo presidents have been elected nonsequentially — Grover Cleveland, 1884 and 1892, and Donald Trump, 2016 and 2024. As a result, Donald Trump is the 45th man to be elected president but is our 47th president.\n\nI grew up in Philadelphia, so I was delighted that the Eagles (we Philadelphians call them “Iggles”) pummeled the Kansas City Chiefs in the Super Bowl, 40-22.

D. Vance of Ohio said that if Donald Trump were reelected, he would advise the president to “fire every single mid-level bureaucrat, every civil servant in the administrative state” and “replace them with our people.” Nearly four weeks into his new term, Trump appears to be executing that plan, attempting to fire or place on administrative leave thousands of federal employees perceived to be politically adverse to him, and reclassifying many more to make them fireable at will. Those hired in their stead will be vetted by Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency, thanks to a new executive order.\n\nLast week, two sets of FBI employees filed the first lawsuits challenging these moves on First Amendment grounds. Both allege that the employees were targeted as a form of retaliation. The essence of a First Amendment retaliation claim is that although the government may deny someone a valuable benefit for any number of reasons, “there are some reasons upon which the government may not rely,” including, pointedly, someone’s “constitutionally protected speech or associations.” The plaintiffs in the FBI cases allege that the Trump administration is demanding a list of 6,000 agents involved in investigating the January 6 and Mar-a-Lago cases in order to possibly punish or purge thousands of agents Trump perceives (surely wrongly in many instances) to be politically opposed to him. The FBI employees should win their First Amendment claims, especially if any mass purge takes place.\n\nZooming out, thousands of other federal employees could well make similar constitutional claims, because what the Trump administration is doing with the FBI appears to be but a small part of a much larger effort to resurrect a government-wide political-patronage system, something the First Amendment forbids.\n\nFrom the founding until 1883, a “spoils”—as in, “to the victor belong the spoils”—system of political patronage took root and flourished in the federal government. New administrations would fire federal officials belonging to the other party and hire their own people. President Andrew Jackson became particularly associated with the spoils system after campaigning on rooting out corruption and firing nearly 10 percent of federal employees, replacing many with supporters upon taking office, but he was far from the only president to reward political cronies with federal jobs, as the University of Pennsylvania law professor Kate Shaw has explained.\n\nPolitical-patronage systems promote corruption at the expense of effective governance, and Americans grew dissatisfied with the cronyism and moblike rule that flowed from the spoils system. Following decades of effort to enact civil-service reform, momentum surged when a disgruntled office-seeker assassinated President James Garfield in 1881. In response, Congress passed the Pendleton Act in 1883 to “regulate and improve the civil service of the United States,” establishing a merit-based system for federal hiring.\n\nUnder the current federal civil-service regime, fewer than 4,000 federal employees—including constitutional officers, such as the attorney general and secretary of state, and top agency officials—serve at the president’s pleasure, fireable for political disagreements or pretty much any other reason. The overwhelming majority of the more than 2 million workers who daily serve the American people in the federal civil service are wisely protected from political firings.\n\nThat protection flows from something even deeper than the Pendleton Act and other federal statutes. In 1947, the Supreme Court was faced with a First Amendment challenge to the Hatch Act, which limits the extent to which most federal officials can engage in overt political activity while in office. The Court upheld the act but made clear that the First Amendment would prohibit Congress from directly restricting the ability to hold federal offices to members of one party, such as by enacting “a regulation providing that no Republican … shall be appointed to federal office.” Notwithstanding the Court’s guidance, the worst practices of political patronage continued to crop up in state and local governments, forcing the Supreme Court to elaborate the point and put a stop to spoils practices in a series of cases.\n\nThe most relevant case to our present-day situation began in 1980, when Republican Illinois Governor Jim Thompson issued an executive order freezing all hiring across state agencies absent express permission from his office. Requests for exceptions became routine, and an agency was set up inside the governor’s office to vet them. Five job-seekers sued, claiming that in practice, the order and exceptions were being used to create a political-patronage system favoring Republicans.\n\nWhen the case reached the Supreme Court, the Court held that systems of political patronage like the one established by Thompson violate the First Amendment. Quoting one of its first patronage decisions, the Court reaffirmed that “conditioning public employment on the provision of support for the favored political party ‘unquestionably inhibits protected belief and association.’” Doing so “pressures employees to pledge political allegiance to a party with which they prefer not to associate, to work for the election of political candidates they do not support, and to contribute money to be used to further policies with which they do not agree.” It is “tantamount to coerced belief,” something the First Amendment plainly forbids. Nor did it matter that Thompson had not issued a direct order specifying that only Republicans would be hired, because “what the First Amendment precludes the government from commanding directly, it also precludes the government from accomplishing indirectly.”\n\nThere is an exception to the First Amendment bar on political hirings and firings. Those officials in legitimate policy making positions can be dismissed for political reasons without offending the Constitution. That’s because in America’s representative democracy, it is important that lawful policy reflects the political will of the voters, as voiced by the executive. But the executive cannot simply label large numbers of officials “policy makers” and render them all fireable at will. Instead, courts must look through labels to the substance of an official’s role and determine whether political alignment is necessary in that role. In any given dispute, the government has the burden of demonstrating that a particular position is in fact a policy-making one before the job-holder may be fired based on raw political allegiance.\n\nThe Trump administration seems set on flouting this precedent. Throughout the 2024 campaign, Trump and those around him signaled that the MAGA movement would expect total loyalty from federal officials. On Inauguration Day, after taking office, Trump suggested that “all” of the “Biden bureaucrats” should be fired. The same day, Trump signed one executive order to freeze much merit-based federal hiring, and he signed another that will help him consolidate political control over existing employees. The latter order conveniently expanded the number of officials to be classified as policy makers—from fewer than 4,000 to potentially hundreds of thousands. The administration also expanded the type of agency hiring authority that would make bringing in loyalists easier. And late last month, federal employees were informed by email that the majority of federal agencies are likely to downsize, and that loyalty will be a determining factor in deciding who stays.\n\nMeanwhile, purges of employees whom Trump likely views as politically misaligned with him have begun to roll out across agencies. The administration has directed agencies to fire most probationary staff, nearly all of whom were hired during the Biden administration. Department of Education employees were reportedly put on leave for simply attending a DEI training in 2017. The FBI officials who sued say they have reason to believe that the Department of Justice is planning to engage in the mass unlawful firing of agents who had any involvement in certain investigations related to President Trump, including the January 6 cases, and the lawful search of Trump’s residence at Mar-a-Lago. DOJ attorneys involved in the January 6 prosecutions were terminated because their work on those cases purportedly would prevent them from “faithfully” implementing Trump’s agenda. At the beginning of February, the administration moved to shut down USAID entirely. Although the administration explains the move as aimed at preventing waste and fraud, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller said—without citing any evidence to support the improbable claim—that the Trump administration had determined that “98 percent of the [USAID] workforce either donated to Kamala Harris or another left-wing candidate,” and Elon Musk posted on X, “USAID was a viper’s nest of radical-left marxists who hate America.” As for replacing those fired, Trump signed a new executive order this week, directing that all future career-appointment hiring decisions be made in consultation with a team lead from Musk’s DOGE.\n\nTaken together, the administration’s actions bear a striking resemblance to the Illinois patronage scheme that the Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional: freeze hiring, purge perceived political opponents, and consolidate all hiring and staffing decisions in a body close to the executive.\n\nThe Trump administration clearly knows that the First Amendment prohibits resurrecting a government-wide political-patronage system. That Inauguration Day executive order expanding the number of purported policy makers claims that “employees in or applicants for Schedule Policy/Career positions are not required to personally or politically support the current President or the policies of the current administration.” Similarly, the administration’s implementing guidance, issued at the end of January, in fact cites the Supreme Court’s anti-patronage decisions, specifying that “Patronage Remains Prohibited.”\n\nBut the administration’s actions and statements suggest that the resurrection of a political-patronage system is well under way. Particularly if political purges continue, courts must see the anti-patronage posturing as pretext and enforce the First Amendment. As the Supreme Court memorably put it in the Illinois case, “To the victor belong only those spoils that may be constitutionally obtained.”","summary":"The First Amendment forbids widespread loyalty purges.","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/02/employee-firing-first-amendment/681702/","image":"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/cGfanAwg38PE8VLzWxN8WrQkT1o=/0x0:2000x1042/1200x625/media/img/mt/2025/02/first_amendment4/original.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-15 12:48:36","author":"Erica Newland,John Langford","authors":["Erica Newland","John Langford"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.283}]}
