Yet even with the ample skepticism about that explanation, there’s no denying the economics were not working in Colbert’s favor.\n\nThe network’s bombshell announcement late Thursday that the “Late Show” will end next May takes away President Donald Trump’s most prominent TV critic and the most popular entertainment program in its genre.\n\nThe television industry’s declining economic health means similar hard calls are already being made with personalities and programming, with others to be faced in the future. For the late-night genre, there are unique factors to consider.\n\nAs recently as 2018, broadcast networks took in an estimated $439 million in advertising revenue for its late-night programs, according to the advertising firm Guidelines. Last year, that number dwindled to $220 million.\n\nOnce a draw for young men, now they’ve turned away\n\nLate-night TV was a particular draw for young men, considered the hardest-to-get and most valuable demographic for advertisers. Increasingly, these viewers are turning to streaming services, either to watch something else entirely or catch highlights of the late-night shows, which are more difficult for the networks to monetize.\n\nMore broadly, the much-predicted takeover of viewers by streaming services is coming to pass. The Nielsen company reported that during the last two months, for the first time ever, more people consumed programming on services like YouTube and Netflix than on ABC, CBS and NBC or any cable network.\n\nNetworks and streamers spent roughly $70 billion on entertainment shows and $30 billion for sports rights last year, said Brian Wieser, CEO of Madison & Wall, an advertising consultant and data services firm. Live sports is the most dependable magnet for viewers and costs for its rights are expected to increase 8% a year over the next decade. With television viewership declining in general, it’s clear where savings will have to come from.\n\nWieser said he does not know whether Colbert’s show is profitable or not for CBS and parent company Paramount Global, but he knows the direction in which it is headed. “The economics of television are weak,” he said.\n\nIn a statement announcing the cancellation, George Cheeks, Paramount Global’s president and chief executive officer, said that “This is purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night. It is not related in any way to the show’s performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount.”\n\nCheeks’ problem is that not everyone believes him.\n\nColbert is a relentless critic of Trump, and earlier this week pointedly criticized Paramount’s decision to settle Trump’s lawsuit against CBS over a “60 Minutes” interview with Kamala Harris. He called Paramount’s $16 million payment to Trump a “big fat bribe,” since the company is seeking the administration’s approval of its merger with Skydance Media.\n\nOn Friday, the Writers Guild of America called for an investigation by New York’s attorney general into whether Colbert’s cancellation is itself a bribe, “sacrificing free speech to curry favor with the Trump administration as the company looks for merger approval.”\n\nCBS’ decision made this a pivotal week for the future of television and radio programming. Congress stripped federal funding for PBS and NPR, threatening the future of shows on those outlets.\n\nJourney Gunderson, executive director of the National Comedy Center, called the decision to end Colbert’s show the end of an era.\n\n“Late-night television has historically been one of comedy’s most audience-accessible platforms — a place where commentary meets community, night after night,” Gunderson said. “This isn’t just the end of a show. It’s the quiet removal of one of the few remaining platforms for daily comedic commentary.\n\nTrump celebrates Colbert’s demise\n\nTrump, who has called in the past for CBS to terminate Colbert’s contract, celebrated the show’s upcoming demise. “I absolutely love that Colbert got fired,” the president wrote on Truth Social. “His talent was even less than his ratings.”\n\nSome experts questioned whether CBS could have explored other ways to save money on Colbert. NBC, for example, has cut costs by eliminating the band on Seth Meyers’ late-night show and curtailing Jimmy Fallon’s “Tonight” show to four nights a week.\n\nCould CBS have saved more money by cutting off the show immediately, instead of letting it run until next May, which sets up an awkward “lame duck” period? Then again, Colbert will keep working until his contract runs out; CBS would have had to keep paying him anyway.\n\nCBS recently cancelled the “After Midnight” show that ran after Colbert. But the network had signaled earlier this year that it was prepared to continue that show until host Taylor Tomlinson decided that she wanted to leave, noted Bill Carter, author of “The Late Shift.”\n\n“It is a very sad day for CBS that they are getting out of the late-night race,” Andy Cohen, host of Bravo’s “Watch What Happens Live,” told The Associated Press. “I mean, they are turning off the lights after the news.”\n\nColbert, if he wanted to continue past next May, would likely be able to find a streaming service willing to pay him, Wieser said. But the future of late-night comedy on the entertainment networks is genuinely at risk. Trump, in fact, may outlast his fiercest comic critics. Jon Stewart, once a weeknight fixture, works one night a week at “The Daily Show” for Paramount’s Comedy Central, a network that seldom produces much original programming any more.\n\nABC’s Jimmy Kimmel, who was chided on social media by Trump on Friday — “I hear Jimmy Kimmel is next” — has a contract that also runs out next year.

The Late Show was one of CBS's top shows, attracting an average audience of 2.57m viewers in 2024.\n\nIts ratings actually improved under Colbert, particularly after it began skewering the Trump administration - the host is one of the president's most vocal critics.\n\nAs a result, some have questioned whether the show's cancellation has anything to do with political pressure.\n\nIts closure comes after CBS parent company Paramount settled with US President Donald Trump over the editing of a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris. \n\nPresident Trump said the way his presidential rival's answer to a question about Israel was presented on two different platforms made her look more favourable to viewers. \n\nCBS noted at the time its settlement did not include a statement of apology or regret. Business commentators said the deal was made partly so as to not affect Paramount's planned merger with Skydance Media, which Trump had the power to halt.\n\nSpeaking after the The Late Show's cancellation was announced, Democratic Senator Adam Schiff said: \"If Paramount and CBS ended the Late Show for political reasons, the public deserves to know. And deserves better.\" \n\nThe sentiment was echoed by Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, who noted the show's cancellation came three days after Colbert's criticism of the Paramount settlement.\n\nThere is no evidence that this was a factor - but it highlights the political climate in which this decision has been made. \n\nIn their statement announcing the end of The Late Show, CBS said it was a \"purely financial decision\" and \"not related in any way to the show's performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount\".","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwye2w5n5q8o","image":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2023/live/18cc99b0-63f3-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-18 23:19:08","author":"Steven McIntosh","authors":["Steven McIntosh"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.275},{"id":343047986,"title":"CBS canned ‘The Late Show’ over tens of millions in financial losses annually — not Stephen Colbert’s politics: sources","text":"CBS brass say they pulled the plug on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” because of its punishing losses — pegged between $40 million and $50 million a year — and claim politics had nothing to do with it, The Post has learned.\n\nThe 61-year-old host got canned just days after he took a dig at the Tiffany Network over its $16 million settlement with Donald Trump over a controversial “60 Minutes” interview with Kamala Harris as the network’s parent Paramount negotiates with the Trump administration regulatory approval for its $8 billion sale to independent studio Skydance.\n\n“I am offended, and I don’t know if anything will ever repair my trust in this company,” Colbert said of the truce in his Monday night monologue. \n\n“But just taking a stab at it, I’d say $16 million would help.”\n\n‘Gets no advertising’\n\nBut scathing jokes at the expense of CBS brass wasn’t the problem, according to insiders. \n\nInstead, the network’s bosses could no longer stomach the fact that Colbert has been plagued with an increasingly dire shortage of advertisers.\n\nThat’s despite Colbert’s No, 1 ratings in his time slot and his status as a key face for the Tiffany Network. \n\nIn the end, Paramount’s co-CEO George Cheeks decided to kill the show, sources said.\n\n“Colbert gets no advertising and late night is a tough spot,” said a person with direct knowledge of CBS’s decision. \n\n“Colbert might be No. 1, but who watches late night TV anymore?”\n\nSome Democrats voiced suspicion, citing the host’s left-wing leanings and CBS owner Paramount’s urgent need to gain an OK from the Trump administration for the merger with Skydance, the Hollywood studio behind the “Mission: Impossible” franchise.\n\n“CBS canceled Colbert’s show just THREE DAYS after Colbert called out CBS parent company Paramount for its $16M settlement with Trump — a deal that looks like bribery,” lefty Sen.

They haven’t called me and said like, ‘Don’t get too comfortable in that office, Stewart!'\"\n\n Stewart, 62, then joked, \"I’ve been kicked out of s------ establishments than that. We’ll land on our feet.\"\n\n On a more serious note, he said that he \"honestly don't know\" what the show's fate will be. \"I’d like to believe that... Like, without The Daily Show, Comedy Central is kind of like muzak at this point. I think we’re the only sort of life that exists on a current basis other than South Park.\"\n\n Stewart would \"like to think we bring enough value\" to the channel, \"but that may not be their consideration,\" he admitted. \"I just don't know.\"\n\n Stewart's comments on the topic came a week after he had 60 Minutes alum Steve Kroft on The Daily Show to talk about Trump's settlement. \n\n On the July 7 episode, Kroft, who retired in 2019 after 30 seasons on 60 Minutes, commented on Paramount's $16 million settlement made with President Donald Trump, who had alleged that CBS' 60 Minutes deceptively edited an interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\n “I think there’s a lot of fear,” Kroft said about the environment at 60 Minutes following the lawsuit. “Fear of losing their job, fear of what’s happening to the country, fear of losing the First Amendment. All of those things.”\n\n He also called the settlement a \"shakedown\" and that \"some people call it extortion.\"\n\n CBS' full statement about Colbert's cancellation emphasized the show's success in the category, seemingly anticipating speculation about whether it had to do with the Paramount settlement. \n\n \"Our admiration, affection, and respect for the talents of Stephen Colbert and his incredible team made this agonizing decision even more difficult,\" the statement said. \"Stephen has taken CBS late night by storm with cutting-edge comedy, a must-watch monologue and interviews with leaders in entertainment, politics, news and newsmakers across all areas.\"\n\n Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\n \"The show has been #1 in late night for nine straight seasons,\" the statement continued. \"Stephen's comedy resonates daily across digital and social media; and the broadcast is a staple of the nation’s zeitgeist.\"","summary":"Stewart weighed in on the Comedy Central show's potential future on his latest podcast episode","url":"https://people.com/jon-stewart-on-fears-about-the-fate-of-the-daily-show-amid-the-late-show-drama-11775263","image":"https://people.com/thmb/eQIDkv4xGrsfOuHCmnohOBHGoCY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(750x349:752x351)/jon-stewart-FYC-Event-2025-stephen-colbert-snl50-071825-8987d809f9bd4527a106d657d30318b2.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-18 22:19:21","author":"Julia Moore","authors":["Julia Moore"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.111},{"id":343040424,"title":"‘No good answers’: Trump facing real ‘danger’","text":"A tumultuous week hasn’t been helped by the US president calling his supporters who favour releasing all documents related to Epstein as “weaklings” who have fallen for a “Democrat hoax”.\n\nBut a US political watcher has told news.com.au that Mr Trump himself helped stoke the flames of his current predicament, having previously promoted wild rumours around Epstein. That had “activated” a group that were not about to simply agree there was nothing to see after all. \n\nThere was a real “danger to Trump,” Professor Robert Rowland of the University of Kansas said.\n\n“Trump has been very adept at using conspiracy theories to support his message.\n\n“And on the Epstein conspiracy theory he, and others, have not been constrained in the least by facticity.”\n\nIn addition, a Republican strategist has said Mr Trump has “no good answers” for those clamouring for more files to be released.\n\nA recent poll found two thirds of Americans think the government is “covering up evidence” it has about Epstein. \n\nThe political crisis emerged on July 7 when the FBI announced that as part of its “commitment to transparency” an “exhaustive review” had been concluded into documents related to Epstein. But “no further disclosure” would be “appropriate or warranted”.\n\nIn addition, the FBI declared Epstein had committed suicide after all. There was no rumoured foul play.\n\nSo that was that. \n\nNo more Epstein files would see the light of day. The fabled “client list,” which Attorney-General Pam Bondi herself had said was on her desk, didn’t actually exist. She said she misspoke and just meant some general Epstein files.\n\nLots of reasonable explanations were given for the documents remaining private. They included details of victims, child sex abuse material or just the usual legal issues. \n\nMr Trump said it was time to move on and urged people to “not waste time and energy on … somebody that no one cares about”.\n\nThe problem is many in the MAGA-sphere do care about Epstein. They care a lot.\n\nYouGov research, released last week, showed 75 per cent of Republicans want the Government to release all the documents it has about the Epstein case and 50 per cent of the same voters think a cover up is occurring.\n\nHigh profile commentators who lean Trump are also underwhelmed. House Speaker Mike Johnson, who is close to Mr Trump, has urged more “transparency”. Even Trump’s own FBI deputy director Don Bongino, a conservative podcaster, was reportedly furious at how the investigation wrapped up.\n\nTrump’s multiple Epstein references\n\nOver the years, Mr Trump hasn’t been shy in hyping scuttlebutt about Epstein’s life, death and the people who knew him. People who knew Epstein included, of course, Mr Trump. But there has never been any claims of wrongdoing against Mr Trump and the pair ended up falling out.\n\nIn 2019, Mr Trump retweeted a post alleging Bill Clinton was involved in Epstein’s death. In 2020, he suggested it was a possibility Epstein may have been killed in jail. \n\nThen, on the campaign trail last year, he said – several times – that a future President Trump would absolutely declassify the so-called Epstein files.\n\nThat helped keep Epstein fresh in the thoughts of many of his supporters. This fuelled theories of a “deep state” and that a host of high-profile people would eventually be accused of heinous crimes. \n\nUndoubtedly, to many in the MAGA movement, it was hoped those famous names would be political foes, proving that they weren’t just mere opponents but evildoers too.\n\nProf Rowland told news.com.au that Mr Trump was adept at using conspiracy theories to galvanise his supporters. \n\n“His use of the ridiculous ‘birther’ theory (that Barack Obama was not a US citizen and so could not be president) is probably the best example”.\n\nBut the US president has now found himself in an “interesting and confusing” situation, the academic said.\n\nIn February, the Justice Department released what it called the “first phase” of previously unseen Epstein documents. But there was little new information in them. \n\nNow in office, Mr Trump may have discovered that, despite the hype, there wasn’t much to the rumours beyond what was already in the public realm about Epstein. \n\nBut it’s hard to close that Pandora’s box he helped to prise open. Those who, for years, have believed Epstein had dirt on scores of public figures won’t be easily persuaded that was never the case. \n\n‘Trump doesn’t have good answers’\n\nRepublican strategist Alex Conant, of Firehouse Strategies, told the US’ National Public Radio that there had been a “real mismanagement of expectations with (Mr Trump’s) base” over what could actually be delivered on Epstein once he was in power.\n\n“Trump doesn’t have good answers because … they have released everything on this that they are legally allowed to release and their hands are really tied moving forward. \n\n“And yet it’s not enough for … his opponents.\n\n“His supporters are fixated on this decade-old scandal that he can’t ever make them happy on and it’s deeply frustrating to him,” Mr Conant said.\n\nDemocrat ‘scam’\n\nProf Rowland said it was “odd” that the administration didn’t simply release more files, “and claim victory, regardless of what the files actually say”.\n\nThat may now be happening. On Thursday, a clearly angry Mr Trump said that due to the “ridiculous amount of publicity” the Epstein crisis was creating, he had told Attorney-General Bondi to release any “pertinent grand jury testimony”. \n\nA grand jury is group of citizens who determine whether there is a likely case that can be taken to a full court jury. The court process to release these documents related to Epstein could take some time, however.\n\nMr Trump said the furore was a “Democrat scam”. That echoed comments he made earlier in the week when he unleashed on social media claiming what he termed “past supporters” had fallen for a “hoax” perpetuated by the Democratic Party “hook, line and sinker” that was all just “bull***t”.\n\n“As a rule, attacking supporters is a terrible way to maintain credibility,” said Prof Rowland. \n\n“Barack Obama was sharply criticised (during the 2024 election campaign) when he told black men that they needed to do more to support Kamala Harris. \n\n“Blaming Democrats for the controversy appears to be a transparent attempt to change the subject.\n\n“That it strains credibility is extremely generous,” he said.\n\n“It also does not seem to have mollified a large group on the right that apparently has bought into the Epstein conspiracy theory.”\n\nProf Rowland said it was possible Mr Trump’s rhetoric over recent days might simply be “poorly planned,” and symptomatic of his sometimes chaotic messaging. Alternatively, he might be trying to “bury the controversy because of something in the files”.\n\nProf Rowland concedes that in itself is pure speculation. But by keeping the remaining files under wraps, that’s exactly what some angry Trump voters have speculated about.\n\nOn Thursday, US newspaper The Wall Street Journal published a 2003 birthday card to Epstein signed from “Donald”. Mr Trump has been adamant the card was not from him and is “fake”. There is no suggestion of any nefarious activity on Mr Trump’s apart.\n\n‘Activated’\n\nUndoubtedly, Mr Trump is good at changing the subject. One big wild announcement and the hope may be the Epstein energy will fade.\n\n“I think Trump will be able to tamp down the controversy with most of his supporters, because they are focused on their own economic situation,” Prof Rowland said. \n\n“But the situation is different for the online and much more engaged MAGA right. \n\n“Bondi and Trump both activated this group with their earlier comments about Epstein and conspiracy theories are common in the information ecosystem of this group. \n\n“The danger for Trump is that the online MAGA right plays a crucial role for him in amplifying his message,” he said. \n\n“Strong arguments are not going to change their minds.","summary":"Donald Trump is now facing a real “danger” from the MAGA base, political watchers have said, as he struggles to close a Pandora’s box he helped open.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/world/north-america/us-politics/no-good-answers-trump-facing-real-danger/news-story/853dced7d03cb6c362166c09e6561802?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/9ee6e49c3a3a15a288eee6a1823a15c7","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-18 22:13:42","author":"Benedict Brook In The Us","authors":["Benedict Brook In The Us"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.496},{"id":343045020,"title":"Did money or politics cause Colbert cancellation?

The Nielsen company reported that during the last two months, for the first time ever, more people consumed programming on services like YouTube and Netflix than on ABC, CBS and NBC or any cable network.\n\nNetworks and streamers spent roughly $70 billion on entertainment shows and $30 billion for sports rights last year, said Brian Wieser, CEO of Madison & Wall, an advertising consultant and data services firm. Live sports is the most dependable magnet for viewers and costs for its rights are expected to increase 8% a year over the next decade. With television viewership declining in general, it's clear where savings will have to come from.\n\nWieser said he does not know whether Colbert's show is profitable or not for CBS and parent company Paramount Global, but he knows the direction in which it is headed. “The economics of television are weak,” he said.\n\nIn a statement announcing the cancellation, George Cheeks, Paramount Global's president and chief executive officer, said that “This is purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night. It is not related in any way to the show’s performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount.”\n\nCheeks' problem is that not everyone believes him.\n\nColbert is a relentless critic of Trump, and earlier this week pointedly criticized Paramount's decision to settle Trump's lawsuit against CBS over a “60 Minutes” interview with Kamala Harris. He called Paramount's $16 million payment to Trump a “big fat bribe,” since the company is seeking the administration's approval of its merger with Skydance Media.\n\nOn Friday, the Writers Guild of America called for an investigation by New York's attorney general into whether Colbert's cancellation is itself a bribe, “sacrificing free speech to curry favor with the Trump administration as the company looks for merger approval.”\n\nCBS' decision made this a pivotal week for the future of television and radio programming. Congress stripped federal funding for PBS and NPR, threatening the future of shows on those outlets.\n\nJourney Gunderson, executive director of the National Comedy Center, called the decision to end Colbert's show the end of an era.\n\n“Late-night television has historically been one of comedy's most audience-accessible platforms — a place where commentary meets community, night after night,” Gunderson said. “This isn't just the end of a show. It's the quiet removal of one of the few remaining platforms for daily comedic commentary.\n\nTrump celebrates Colbert's demise\n\nTrump, who has called in the past for CBS to terminate Colbert's contract, celebrated the show's upcoming demise. “I absolutely love that Colbert got fired,” the president wrote on Truth Social. “His talent was even less than his ratings.”\n\nSome experts questioned whether CBS could have explored other ways to save money on Colbert. NBC, for example, has cut costs by eliminating the band on Seth Meyers' late-night show and curtailing Jimmy Fallon's “Tonight” show to four nights a week.\n\nCould CBS have saved more money by cutting off the show immediately, instead of letting it run until next May, which sets up an awkward “lame duck” period? Then again, Colbert will keep working until his contract runs out; CBS would have had to keep paying him anyway.\n\nCBS recently cancelled the “After Midnight” show that ran after Colbert. But the network had signaled earlier this year that it was prepared to continue that show until host Taylor Tomlinson decided that she wanted to leave, noted Bill Carter, author of “The Late Shift.”\n\n“It is a very sad day for CBS that they are getting out of the late-night race,” Andy Cohen, host of Bravo's “Watch What Happens Live,\" told The Associated Press. “I mean, they are turning off the lights after the news.”\n\nColbert, if he wanted to continue past next May, would likely be able to find a streaming service willing to pay him, Wieser said. But the future of late-night comedy on the entertainment networks is genuinely at risk. Trump, in fact, may outlast his fiercest comic critics. Jon Stewart, once a weeknight fixture, works one night a week at “The Daily Show” for Paramount's Comedy Central, a network that seldom produces much original programming any more.\n\nABC's Jimmy Kimmel, who was chided on social media by Trump on Friday — “I hear Jimmy Kimmel is next” — has a contract that also runs out next year. Kimmel, 57, openly wondered in a Variety interview before signing his latest three-year contract extension how long he wanted to do it. He's hosted his show since 2003.\n\n“I have moments where I go, I cannot do this anymore,” Kimmel told Variety in 2022. “And I have moments where I go, what am I gonna do with my life if I'm not doing this anymore?'

Robert Putnam’s Bowling Alone documented the steady withdrawal from civil society decades ago. But Gen Z is the first generation to grow up almost entirely within the ruins. \n\nThe result? A kind of digital Sturm und Drang: inward, self-critical, and jaded — especially among young men. Teenagers and young adults build sprawling inner worlds but lack tangible communities. As Jessica Grose of the New York Times noted, “Gen Z-ers are more trusting of their peers and what they can see and build themselves.” They crave authenticity — but find only abstraction.\n\nSo when the choice in 2024 came down to the bureaucratic blandness of former Vice President Kamala Harris’s progressivism or Trump’s blunt, populist appeals, Gen Z went with the latter, not because they’re all ready for a theocracy but because they’re desperate for something that feels rooted in reality.\n\nZoomers, in fact, aren’t interested in owning the libs so much as they’re interested in owning something, anything — a house, a belief, or a sense of belonging. \n\nThey long for something from which to plant roots. \n\nImagine: You’re in your early 20s. You’ve been told you’ll own nothing, condone everything, and like it. Your adolescence was a blur of virtual school and political dysfunction.

But it’s not a blip either. It’s a sustained cultural pushback.

But the future of late-night comedy on the entertainment networks is genuinely at risk. Trump, in fact, may outlast his fiercest comic critics. Jon Stewart, once a weeknight fixture, works one night a week at “The Daily Show” for Paramount's Comedy Central, a network that seldom produces much original programming any more.\n\nABC's Jimmy Kimmel, who was chided on social media by Trump on Friday — “I hear Jimmy Kimmel is next” — has a contract that also runs out next year. Kimmel, 57, openly wondered in a Variety interview before signing his latest three-year contract extension how long he wanted to do it. He's hosted his show since 2003.\n\n“I have moments where I go, I cannot do this anymore,” Kimmel told Variety in 2022. “And I have moments where I go, what am I gonna do with my life if I'm not doing this anymore?' It's a very complicated thing ... I'm not going to do this forever.”\n\nColbert, Kimmel and Stewart were all nominated for Emmy awards this week.\n\nAP journalist Liam McEwan in Los Angeles contributed to this report.

The network will be ending The Late Show in May, and—”\n\nThe studio spectators cut him off with a loud, extended chorus of boos, as Colbert appeared to vacillate between laughing and choking up. “Yeah, I share your feelings!” he gingerly continued. “It’s not just the end of our show, but it’s the end of The Late Show on CBS. I’m not being replaced.” Another string of boos hit, before Colbert raised his hands to add another point. “I do wanna say, the folks at CBS have been great partners,” the host declared, expressing gratitude to his staffers and viewers and prompting them to cheer for the next 10 months The Late Show will remain on air—its very last, as a capper to the franchise that David Letterman kicked off in 1993.\n\nLeft conspicuously unthanked: Paramount, the corporation that Colbert has called home for two decades. Also unmentioned: his Monday monologue, in which he’d called his parent company’s notorious legal settlement with President Donald Trump “a big fat bribe.” But it hardly escaped anyone’s notice that The Late Show’s cancellation had happened the same week that Colbert spent three minutes of his show picking apart Paramount’s refusal to defend CBS, in court, from Trump’s ridiculous lawsuit against 60 Minutes. Nor was it all that believable that Colbert’s bosses would suddenly drop one of their biggest and most beloved celebrities without some more unseemly objectives in mind.\n\nLast October, then-candidate Trump’s team baselessly accused 60 Minutes’ editorial team of editing the show’s interview with Kamala Harris to tilt the election in her favor. The storied newsmagazine’s anchors and staffers later warned viewers, on the show itself, that the constitutional right to a free and fair press had been undermined by Paramount’s planned merger with the entertainment firm Skydance. The latter company is owned by the son of tech mogul and Trump pal Larry Ellison—who had himself invested not only in this merger, but in one of Trump’s A.I. initiatives. Paramount needed the Federal Communications Commission’s approval for the deal to happen—which it was unlikely to earn under agency Chair Brendan Carr, who had explicitly stated that the 60 Minutes “issue” would be a factor of consideration. So, instead of fighting an easily winnable case, Paramount folded, pushing out several 60 Minutes leaders and gifting $16 million to Trump’s lawyers and his presidential library.\n\nNow, the suits aren’t calling Colbert’s departure a firing per se; CBS’s statement referred to the host as “irreplaceable” and characterized the Late Show’s ending as “a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night. It is not related in any way to the show’s performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount.”\n\nNo one believed it when Paramount said the exact same thing about the Trump settlement. (Co-CEO George Cheeks, who informed shareholders of that legal resolution, is also the reported decisionmaker behind The Late Show’s end.) And no one believes it now, in spite of the undeniable fact that traditional late-night TV is a format in decline. The Late Show was consistently the second-most-viewed show of its genre, lagging behind only Fox News’ Gutfeld! in ratings. Certainly, Colbert’s well-resourced shop was pricey: At Puck News, Matthew Belloni writes that the show reported $40 million in annual losses, thanks to steep plunges in ad revenue that have racked traditional TV as an enterprise. And insider publications like Puck, Variety, and Status News have reported that CBS had expressed concern over Late Show finances for months, as the network reviewed Colbert’s contract and its summer 2026 expiration date.\n\nNevertheless, Variety’s reporting also adds that “Paramount has appeared extremely sensitive” to Colbert’s brand of anti-Trump political comedy, especially in light of the settlement. And the Ellison family members who control Skydance are unmistakably pro-Trump conservatives who hope to shift Paramount away from its more liberal bona fides. (See also: Jon Stewart, who’s already worried that The Daily Show could be sold off.)\n\nOn top of that, Larry Ellison’s son, David, met with the FCC’s Carr earlier this week to get the merger ironed out, promising that CBS would embrace “varied ideological perspectives” under his watch. Such perspectives are likely to be influenced by the right-wingers Ellison wishes to add to the CBS operation, including David Rhodes (a longtime Rupert Murdoch lieutenant), Jeff Shell (the appointed president for the Paramount-Skydance conglomerate, who reportedly pressured 60 Minutes executives ahead of the settlement), and Free Press editor Bari Weiss. (According to Belloni, Skydance is reportedly in talks to acquire Weiss’ increasingly Trumpy publication; if both the Paramount and Free Press deals go through, Rhodes and Weiss would serve as the “ideological guide” for CBS News.)\n\nAll this is why no one really thinks that Colbert’s cancellation is just business as usual. Trump was certainly gleeful, posting on Truth Social, “I absolutely love that Colbert’ got fired.” Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Adam Schiff—the latter of whom was a guest on Colbert’s Thursday show—each voiced their suspicions that The Late Show was done in for “political reasons.” The Writers Guild of America called for New York state Attorney General Letitia James to launch an investigation into that possibility. And plenty of Colbert’s fellow comedians weighed in, with Jimmy Kimmel offering CBS a social media “fuck you” and Julia Louis-Dreyfus directing an angry statement at Paramount and its owner, Shari Redstone. Even CBS staffers are raging, with a few anonymous sources telling the Independent that not one of them “is buying that it’s a financial decision.”\n\nAt the end of the day, it’s also a hell of a way for Paramount to end its longtime, lucrative partnership with one of the defining comics of a generation. The studio acquired Comedy Central in 2003, just as Colbert was coming to wider fame as correspondent for Stewart’s first Daily Show run. Shortly after, he got a landmark solo gig as host of the channel’s Colbert Report, before moving to CBS as Letterman’s Late Show successor—a prestigious slot he earned just as Donald Trump was rising to national power. By the time Colbert cedes his hosting duties next May, he’ll have worked under Paramount for 23 straight years, a career that’s brought him millions of fans thanks to his sharp, hilarious, unvarnished takedowns of modern-day American conservatism. Throughout this era, Colbert bravely called out President George W. Bush to his face at the 2006 White House Correspondents’ Dinner, ran a brief presidential campaign, testified to Congress on behalf of immigrant farmworkers, made a personal enemy of Trump with his Late Show commentary, and even confronted, on air, the sexual assault allegations leveled against former CBS chief Les Moonves.\n\nIt was that honesty and frankness, combined with his biting touch, that made Stephen Colbert such a TV icon. Paramount had always known that, yet it sold him out for cheap. No wonder Colbert’s fans are once again calling for him to run for president. He’ll certainly have some extra time to plan a campaign very soon.","summary":"Paramount says it’s a business decision.

It hired Stephen Colbert, who had collected Emmys and acclaim while hosting his Comedy Central talk show, The Colbert Report; gave him total creative control; and fully revamped Manhattan’s Ed Sullivan Theater so Colbert could make the show’s longtime venue his own. After a shaky first year, Colbert found his footing in the lead-up to the 2016 election by focusing his opening monologues more pointedly on politics. The Late Show soon became the highest-rated talk show in America—a crown it has not relinquished since.\n\nTen years on, CBS has snatched the crown off its head. The network appears to have grown so dismayed with the state of late-night television that it has unceremoniously canceled one of the genre’s most successful stalwarts: In a statement last night, CBS announced that not only will this season of The Late Show—set to air through May 2026—be the program’s last, but the franchise will also be retired entirely. (“We consider Stephen Colbert irreplaceable,” the statement offers as explanation.) The decision quickly prompted plenty of speculation among industry observers, given Colbert’s recent, unvarnished scorn for CBS’s parent company, Paramount, after it settled a lawsuit with Donald Trump; the president had accused 60 Minutes, the network’s venerated TV newsmagazine, of deceptively editing an election-season interview with Kamala Harris. (CBS News, which produces 60 Minutes, denied the claim.) But whether or not there was some political motivation behind the cancellation (the network called the reason purely financial), the underlying point is clear: The Late Show is no longer valuable enough for CBS to bother protecting it.\n\nAs the business of television changes, late-night talk shows have found themselves in a particularly awkward spot. For one, people have stopped flocking to linear television as their evenings wind down. If they do turn the TV on, it’s often to check out what’s new to stream rather than to put up with a somewhat staid format interrupted by many commercial breaks. The customary celebrity chats and musical performances typically appear online not long after they air, and said celebrities now have many other outlets for plugging their projects: video podcasts, YouTube shows. The cost of producing one of those alternatives is also far smaller than the budget for a glitzy affair like The Late Show.\n\nThese arguments always get trotted out as nightly programs drop off the map—like when The Late Show’s lead-out, The Late Late Show, didn’t survive its host James Corden’s departure; and when its follow-up, the Taylor Tomlinson–hosted variety show At Midnight, lasted just over a year before the comedian decided to return to performing stand-up full-time. Questions about the genre’s relevance are also why Late Night With Seth Meyers had to get rid of its house band to survive, and why Comedy Central chose not to replace The Daily Show’s former host Trevor Noah. Instead, the cable channel was satisfied with bringing back Noah’s predecessor Jon Stewart for one night a week, rotating the other episodes among the current cast.\n\nAnd yet: Even though Puck reported that Colbert’s program was losing more than $40 million a year for CBS, there’s something quite shocking about a network simply giving up a foothold as established as The Late Show. Brand names are hard to come by in television, and The Late Show was a big one: Letterman built it up over the course of the 1990s, after NBC passed him over as Johnny Carson’s successor to The Tonight Show. Colbert then inherited a program defined by its past host’s curmudgeonly brand of snark and fundamentally remade it into a much more thoughtful and authentic show. He’s proved capable of deep, empathetic interviews with guests and spiky, aggressive political joke-making (by broadcast TV’s rigid standards).\n\nStill, Colbert would never be able to achieve the ubiquity that Carson and Letterman enjoyed before the advent of streaming. The occasional clip might go viral, and entertainment sites will write up the best parts of the monologue; the talk-show desk, however, no longer comes with a seat of cultural power. Colbert was once the most irreverent member of his late-night brethren (people forget what a bomb-thrower his satirical Colbert Report character could be), but he has since become more of a fatherly figure—one I value as part of the TV firmament but who doesn’t exactly scream “cutting edge.”\n\nThen again, “cutting edge” is not something CBS has sought in a long time. It’s hard to know what could possibly take over for The Late Show when it vanishes in mid-2026. Sitcom reruns? Movies you could just as easily catch on Netflix? The point of network television is to offer something that has a live jolt to it—sports, stand-up, the occasional drama or comedy shows that become appointment viewing. As the medium dissolves from relevance, its owners instead seem content not to create anything of cultural importance. The Late Show is not the juggernaut it once was, sure. But what’s most tragic is to think of it being replaced by nothing at all.","summary":"The surprise cancellation of The Late Show is just the latest blow to the genre.","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2025/07/late-show-stephen-colbert-canceled-cbs/683602/","image":"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/_4RMjZtDEzvrC30vheMtL6vkeaM=/0x0:2000x1125/720x405/media/img/mt/2025/07/2025_07_18_Sims_late_night_model_final/original.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-18 20:23:02","author":"David Sims","authors":["David Sims"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.308},{"id":343018670,"title":"Ex-CBS News boss David Rhodes in talks to return after Paramount-Skydance deal closes: report","text":"Former CBS News boss David Rhodes is reportedly in talks to retake his old throne at the Tiffany Network if owner Paramount’s merger with Skydance is finally approved.\n\nRhodes, who served as president of CBS News from 2011 to 2019 and spent a decade before that at Fox News, is currently executive chairman of Sky News in the UK.\n\nHis possible return back across the pond, reported by Puck News, comes amid speculation that Skydance CEO David Ellison has been wooing Bari Weiss, co-founder of news site Free Press, to join the struggling network.\n\nThe two attended the high-powered “summer camp for billionaires” in Sun Valley, Idaho, earlier this month, where Ellison supposedly held early-stage talks with Weiss about acquiring the Free Press, according to the New York Times.\n\nCBS News, Paramount, Skydance and Sky News did not immediately respond to The Post’s requests for comment.\n\nRhodes is very happy in London at Sky News, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.\n\nThe network named Tom Cibrowski as CBS News president in May after CBS boss Wendy McMahon stepped down over the impending settlement with President Trump.\n\nEarlier this month, Paramount agreed to pay $16 million sum to settle the $20 billion lawsuit over the allegedly biased editing of a “60 Minutes” interview with Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris.\n\nShari Redstone, chair and controlling shareholder of Paramount, told her board she was in favor of resolving the issue.\n\nThe deal was expected to clear the way for Trump-nominated FCC Chair Brendan Carr to approve the $8.4 billion Skydance merger.\n\nOn Thursday, CBS canceled “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” over what it called the “financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late-night.” \n\nThe top-rated late-night show, launched by David Letterman in 1993, will go dark next May.\n\nColbert was a frequent critic of President Trump.","summary":"David Rhodes served as president of CBS News from 2011 to 2019.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/07/18/media/ex-cbs-news-boss-david-rhodes-in-talks-to-return-after-paramount-skydance-deal-closes-report/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/108381136.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/L9XaWYj6-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-18 20:09:19","author":"Taylor Herzlich","authors":["Taylor Herzlich"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.157},{"id":343023680,"title":"Democrats say ‘public deserves to know’ if Stephen Colbert cancellation linked to Trump-Paramount criticism – US politics live","text":"Democrats are questioning the timing of CBS’s announcement that it was canceling The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, days after Colbert criticized the network’s parent company Paramount for settling a $16m lawsuit with Donald Trump.\n\nColbert panned Paramount for settling with Trump over the president’s claim that CBS News deceptively edited an interview with the then presidential candidate Kamala Harris.

And the crass insult wasn’t shouted by another player, but by an obnoxious soldier dude who is the game’s announcer. Things only got worse and weirder from there. \n\nI didn’t know what to expect when booting up Off The Grid. But since launching in early access in October 2024, the game has been marketed heavily on the PlayStation Store and has now leapt to Steam after previously being exclusive to the Epic Game Store on PC. To help promote Off The Grid’s Steam launch, sites like Polygon, IGN, and even Kotaku itself ran sponsored posts about the game. These posts championed its frequent updates, “strong following,” and heavily mentioned that District 9 director Neill Blomkamp helped create Off The Grid’s world. So, I decided to finally check out OTG, as the kids call it, and see what this game is all about! \n\nAfter an admittedly well-produced intro video, I was introduced to Master Sergeant Cobra, perhaps the most annoying video game man I’ve ever met. After his lovely “cum bubble” insult, he explained the basic premise of Off The Grid. It’s a third-person battle royale in which you try to survive while also finding valuable loot that you can extract mid-game and sell to other players later. More on that in a bit.\n\nSo, what is Off The Grid?\n\nThen the game tossed me into a match. And sadly, Cobra was still in my ear, yelling at me, saying things like: “Come on, you chickenshit pussies!” and “Your safe zone is collapsing.” And best of all, you get to hear these same insults over and over. Fun stuff. So happy I’m here.\n\nThe actual gameplay of Off The Grid isn’t groundbreaking. You jump out of a plane, land on a map, find weapons and loot, fight other players, and hopefully end up the last team standing. In my first match, most of the players I encountered seemed to be bots. Looking online, this seems to be a common problem. Also looking online, I spotted a lot of players worried the game was going to get shut down soon because it takes a long time to find matches, and often you get paired with bots. \n\nWhen I finally ran into a real player, or what seemed to be a real player, they were dressed like Donald Trump. Trump and Kamala Harris are skins you can buy in the game’s store. Trump’s skin has a “No Woke” sticker. After playing a few matches, I saw a lot of real players running around in the Trump skin. I’ll let you decide what that means about Off The Grid’s playerbase. \n\nAfter a few hours of winning and losing, I had figured out what Off The Grid was: It’s a so-so third-person battle royale with a few neat ideas buried under a ton of garbage and bullshit. Gunplay feels snappy enough, but movement feels floaty in a way that makes it hard to control my character. Being able to swap out your limbs on the fly with new ones you find or loot off dead players is cool, and some of the limbs have unique power-ups that can help. Sadly, most of my time in Off The Grid was spent looking for other players to fight and waiting for matches to start. \n\nRemember NFTs? Gunzilla hopes not\n\nIn all those previously mentioned sponsored posts advertising the game, they all failed to reveal that this is an NFT/blockchain game. Remember how I mentioned that you can extract loot during matches and sell it to other players? Well, it’s all NFTs, baby. \n\nI earned a rare arm and sold it for 60 GUN (Gunzilla’s cryptotoken) to another player. Each item has a unique code, and it seems there’s a finite amount available. When I completed my sale, I checked my transaction history, and it was labeled as being part of my “GUNZ Wallet.” However, because I’m on Xbox Series X/S, I don’t actually have access to my GUNZ Wallet or the GUN tokens inside it. This seems to be because Xbox, PlayStation, and Valve won’t allow Gunzilla to tie the actual blockchain into the game. (On the Epic Store, all of that stuff is functional and active in the game.) I don’t know what this means for the GUN tokens that I earned from selling the arm. Can I ever cash them out for real dollars? Will any user-sold items I buy on Xbox be available in future Gunzilla games? \n\nGunzilla, the company that now owns Game Informer, has tried to downplay all of this NFT/Blockchain crap despite cutting deals with companies in the industry. That seems to be because they understand that a lot of people hate all that crap. In an FAQ posted on Off The Grid’s official website, they respond to people asking if this is an NFT game:\n\nOff The Grid is not an NFT game. It’s a battle royale game with an optional NFT element. If you want to try out NFTs, you can; if you don’t want to, you don’t have to. It’s entirely up to the player how they want to play the game, and the game is playable without dipping into NFTs.\n\nAnd that’s true, in the sense that you can play games and never do anything with the loot you earn from matches. But that seems to be a big part of the gameplay loop built into Off The Grid, so ignoring NFTs and the player marketplace seems like a bad way to experience the game. \n\nOf course, the real question is: Do you want to experience Off The Grid? If we ignore the NFT shit, the actual game isn’t much to write home about. I struggled to find real players both before the match started and after I was in the game. Combat is fine, but if I’m going to play a third-person battle royale, I’d rather play Fortnite. And the game’s entire attitude just sucks. Being insulted over and over by the announcer gets old fast, and every inch of the game is filled with the kind of edgy jokes that 13-year-olds repeat after learning a new swear word. \n\nSo, yeah, I guess if you want to grind away at earning fake coins on the blockchain by farming rare loot in a mediocre third-person shooter, you might be the target audience for Off The Grid. For everyone else, throw a dart at a board covered in other battle royale games and play the one you hit instead. At the very least, you won’t have to deal with players dressed as Donald Trump.","summary":"I was called a  “regurgitated cum bubble” within the first minutes of booting up Gunzilla’s free-to-play battle royale shooter, Off The Grid.

In a Feb. 7 Fox News interview with Martha MacCallum, Carr cited Trump’s lawsuit against CBS and said, the president “has been right on these media bias issues.” Carr said about the president, “He came out early and said, ‘This thing [“60 Minutes” interview] looks like it has been pretty chopped up.’” The application of the FCC’s “news distortion” policy in this way was highly unusual, according to former agency officials.\n\n On Tuesday, July 15, Ellison and his lawyer, Matthew A. Brill of Latham & Watkins, met with Carr, along with Carr’s chief of staff Greg Watson and Ben Arden, special counsel in the office of the bureau chief of the FCC’s Media Bureau. According to a letter from Brill posted Friday in the FCC’s docket for the matter, Ellison and Brill “emphasized the public interest benefits” of the Skydance-Paramount transaction and “We also urged the Media Bureau to promptly grant” approval of the transfer of the CBS licenses to “New Paramount.”\n\n Among the topics Ellison and Brill discussed at the FCC meeting: Skydance’s “commitment to unbiased journalism and its embrace of diverse viewpoints, principles that will ensure CBS’s editorial decision-making reflects the varied ideological perspectives of American viewers.” (According to CBS, Skydance played no part in the decision to cancel “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert,” which was announced publicly Thursday.)\n\n Carr, meanwhile, has championed the Trump administration’s goal of eradicating diversity, equity and inclusion programs, calling DEI policies an “invidious forms of discrimination.” To that end, Ellison and his lawyer “noted Skydance’s commitment to promoting non-discrimination and equal employment opportunity at New Paramount, ensuring the company is fully compliant with law.”\n\n With respect to the Skydance-Paramount transaction’s “significant public interest benefits,” Ellison and Brill “explained the Ellison family and RedBird represent fresh leadership with the vision and experience needed to drive New Paramount’s long-term growth in the face of the challenges presented by today’s media landscape, all while preserving and enhancing the legacy and broad reach of both the national CBS television network and the company’s 28 owned-and-operated local television stations,” per the filing.\n\n If and when the Paramount-Skydance deal closes to create “Paramount Skydance Corp.,” Redstone, who is Paramount controlling shareholder, is set to exit the merged company’s board. Ellison would assume the role as CEO and chairman of the combined Paramount-Skydance. The company would be controlled by the Ellison family and remain publicly traded.\n\n Also at Tuesday’s meeting with the FCC, Ellison and Brill again addressed allegations “regarding the prospect of undue foreign influence over New Paramount.” \n\n Third-party commenters in the FCC’s Skydance-Paramount proceeding have raised concerns about the potential for Chinese influence on the merged company, citing the minority interest in Skydance held by Chinese company Tencent Holdings. In a response, Skydance said in a March 10 filing with the FCC, “Any insinuation that a great and deeply patriotic American family, the Ellisons, will be swayed by Communist influences is offensive.”\n\n In the latest Skydance filing, it called the claims of potential Chinese influence over New Paramount “erroneous.” At the July 15 meeting, Ellison and Brill “reiterated that Tencent will hold only a non-voting, passive interest in New Paramount” of less than 5%, in the form of publicly traded shares it would be free to purchase on the Nasdaq. That gives Tencent “no governance or informational rights and therefore no ability to influence the operation of New Paramount,” according to the filing.\n\n “[W]e made clear that Mr. Ellison will lead New Paramount with a talented team of executives focused on American storytelling, and that RedBird’s investment in New Paramount will not involve any participation by any Chinese entity or individual,” according to the Skydance filing. “The planned governance structure will ensure the Ellison family’s management of New Paramount is fully consistent with the Commission’s rules and will not be subject to any Chinese (or other foreign) influence.”\n\n Pictured above: David Ellison, Brendan Carr","summary":"More than a year after Skydance Media and its partners clinched a deal with Shari Redstone and Paramount Global to merge the companies, the FCC has yet to act on an application to approve the transfer of CBS licenses to the new ownership.

The host quipped that their response echoes how he feels about the news, too.\n\n \"Yeah, I share your feelings,\" he told the crowd. \"It's not just the end of our show, but it's the end of The Late Show on CBS. I'm not being replaced. This is all just going away.\"\n\n Colbert's fellow late night how Kimmel posted a clip of Thursday's broadcast on his Instagram Stories to share his ire with the news and give support to his close friend.\n\n \"Love you Stephen,\" Kimmel wrote, before adding a message for the network that made the decision. \"F--- you and all your Sheldons CBS.\"\n\n Colbert was notably gracious during his announcement of the show's future retirement. As audience members continued to loudly share their displeasure at the news, the host pressed on to thank CBS, viewers, and all the Late Show band and staff for their support over the years.\n\n \"We get to do this show for each other, every day, all day, and I've had the pleasure and the responsibility of sharing what we do every day with you in front of this camera for the last 10 years,\" he said.\n\n He concluded, \"Let me tell you, it is a fantastic job. I wish somebody else was getting it. And it's a job that I'm looking forward to doing with this usual gang of idiots for another 10 months. It's going to be fun.\"\n\n Kimmel hasn't been the only one to speak out against CBS's decision, especially as many have questioned the timing of the announcement given that Colbert recently criticized the network's corporate parent, Paramount Global, for settling a suit filed by President Donald Trump that some legal observers think should have been dismissed on First Amendment grounds.\n\n Celebrities flocked to an Instagram post shared by Late Show and Colbert's personal account to send their support for Colbert and give their own call outs to the network behind the decision.\n\n \"Love you Stephen. This is absolute bulls---,\" Severance star Adam Scott wrote. \"And I for one am looking forward to the next 10 months of shows. ✊😡💔.\"\n\n Former Late Show With Stephen Colbert bandleader Jon Batiste called Colbert \"the greatest to ever do it\" and Rachel Zegler wrote, \"I am extremely sad. I adore you, Stephen.\"\n\n Sen. Elizabeth Warren — who has been candid about her disapproval over Paramount settling the lawsuit brought by Trump over a 2024 60 Minutes interview with his contender in that year's presidential election, Kamala Harris — is among the move's most vocal detractors.\n\n \"CBS canceled Colbert's show just THREE DAYS after Colbert called out CBS parent company Paramount for its $16M settlement with Trump — a deal that looks like bribery,\" the Massachusetts senator alleged in an X post on Thursday. \"America deserves to know if his show was canceled for political reasons. Watch and share his message.\"\n\n Though CBS labeled Trump's suit \"completely without merit\" and asked a judge to dismiss it, the network eventually conceded, a decision that many decried in light of Paramount's effort to merge with Skydance Media, which would require the approval of the Trump administration.\n\n Pushing further speculation about why The Late Show has been axed is Trump's reaction to the news.\n\n \"I absolutely love that Colbert got fired. His talent was even less than his ratings,\" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post on Friday morning. \"I hear Jimmy Kimmel is next. Has even less talent than Colbert!\"\n\n Despite Trump's celebration, there's still several months to go before Colbert bids farewell to his late night show. And the host is clearly not backing down on his criticism of the sitting president.\n\n During Thursday night's episode, the host roasted Trump for several recent announcements, quipping that clearly the former host of The Apprentice would \"rather have us talk about his hand than Jeffrey Epstein.\"\n\n The Emmy winner accused Trump of \"desperately looking for a scapegoat\" as he draws ire from across the political aisle for reversing his campaign position on exposing the client list of the disgraced financier and convicted sex offender, whose 2019 death in jail was ruled a suicide. Colbert joked that it would explain why Trump fired Maurene Comey, the Manhattan federal prosecutor who worked on the cases against Epstein as well as his accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell and hip-hop mogul Sean \"Diddy\" Combs.\n\n \"[Trump] pulled the UNO reverse card, calling on the FBI to investigate this Jeffrey Epstein hoax, by which he evidently means he wants the FBI to investigate the folks who investigated Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking, which is weird,\" Colbert said.\n\n Watch Colbert's full segment from Thursday night's episode of The Late Show above.","summary":"The late night host is one of many famous figures who have spoken out against the network's move.","url":"https://ew.com/jimmy-kimmel-blasts-cbs-after-late-show-cancellation-11775225","image":"https://ew.com/thmb/52ruT4TnKrohFWK4mHh2ASh-7T0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/jimmy-kimmel-the-late-show-with-stephen-colbert-071825-ba6b8adaa5a54e44a6641a9fc7f8e1d4.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-18 19:35:00","author":"Mekishana Pierre","authors":["Mekishana Pierre"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.128},{"id":343015608,"title":"Joe Scarborough Admits ‘Late Show’ Economics Were Making ‘Less and Less Sense,’ but Colbert Firing ‘Timing Is Terrible’ | Video","text":"MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough admitted that while the economic vigor it takes to uphold traditional late night shows has changed over the years, the timing of Stephen Colbert’s firing from CBS’ “The Late Show” is a bit off, pointing out that the host just criticized his network’s parent company Paramount for its $16 million settlement with President Donald Trump over a 2024 “60 Minutes” interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\n“The economics of the late night shows just didn’t make the kind of sense that it’s made for the past 50 years through Jack Paar, the age of [Johnny] Carson, of course [David] Letterman, you go on and on,” Scarborough reflected on Friday’s “Morning Joe.” “So the the economics were making less and less sense, but the timing of this actually is terrible, and it’s terrible because you had the settlement with Donald Trump, and then you had Colbert and Jon Stewart criticizing that decision. And then a week later they’re saying, ‘Oh, unfortunately we don’t have the money to continue this.’\n\n“I mean, it’s not even like they’re trying to hide the main purpose of it,” the host continued. “I mean, it’s certainly, again, you can make that economic argument, but that economic argument should’ve been made weeks before this or should’ve been made a couple months down the road. This just makes it look completely connected with the ’60 Minutes’ settlement.”\n\nWatch the full “Morning Joe” segement below:\n\nScarborough was referring to Paramount Global, the parent company of CBS, which houses Colbert’s long-running late night series “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert,” and its decision to pay Trump $16 million after the president claimed the network deceptively edited its “60 Minutes” interview with Harris to make her more likable in an effort to boost her chances at the polls.\n\nThe payout was met with widespread criticism by several media figures, including Colbert, which Willie Geist noted while also pointing out cutbacks happening in the broadcast world as a whole.\n\n“It’s true that there’s trimming happening all over the place at broadcast networks. There are late night shows having to give up their bands and things like that,” Geist explained. “But Stephen Colbert two nights ago on his show called that settlement on the ’60 Minutes’ interview a bribe. He was very critical on the air of Paramount. And then about 48 hours later you have this decision coming down that his show would be canceled.”\n\nColbert shared the news on Thursday’s episode of “The Late Show,” saying that after 10 years, it would come to an end in May 2026, which CBS said was a “financial” decision.

The news comes at a politically fraught moment for CBS and its parent company, Paramount Global. It’s also the capper on the long arc of late-night political comedy, a genre Colbert was instrumental in building and which now, finally, appears to be on its last legs. \nIn a statement, CBS said its decision to end The Late Show — which began with David Letterman as host in 1993 — was “purely financial.” \n“We are proud that Stephen called CBS home,” the CBS statement said. “This is purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night. It is not related in any way to the show’s performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount.”\nThat last line, that The Late Show’s cancellation has nothing to do with “other matters happening at Paramount,” seems directly aimed at tamping down speculation about CBS and Paramount Global’s political motivations for cancelling a decades-long fixture of network television.\nParamount Global is currently attempting to merge with Skydance Media, and company leadership has been acting as though they are concerned that President Donald Trump might try to block the merger. Earlier this month, CBS and 60 minutes announced a $16 million settlement in its lawsuit with Trump over the editing of a segment about former Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris — an extraordinary concession for a media company in a case that experts agree CBS would have likely won in court. The longtime executive producer of 60 Minutes also resigned earlier this year, citing threats to his journalistic independence. \nDays before the cancellation, Colbert said on his show, “I am offended” by the settlement. “I don’t know if anything — anything — will repair my trust in this company. But, just taking a stab at it, I’d say $16 million would help,” he quipped. The payout, he added, was a “big fat bribe.”\nTwo days later, reports say, CBS told Colbert they were canceling his show. \nThe network’s stated reason for canceling the show has the sheen of believability. It’s true that the late-night ecosystem is struggling. Still, Colbert’s show has consistently led the ratings for its time slot. CBS and Paramount Global, The Atlantic contended on Thursday, no longer deserve the benefit of the doubt.\nOn Truth Social, Trump — a frequent target of Colbert’s jokes — is celebrating. \n“I absolutely love that Colbert got fired,” Trump posted Friday morning. “His talent was even less than his ratings.”\nColbert’s ousting feels symbolic, not just of CBS’s apparent decision to bow down to Trump, but of the end of late-night political comedy as a genre. Sure, John Oliver’s Last Week Tonight continues gamely on HBO, but the kind of late-night show that felt urgent and necessary 20 years ago — the stalwart outraged host cracking wise about the foibles of the corrupt federal government and the credulous media ecosystem that enabled it — has been fading for a long time. Now, its moment is coming to a close.\nJon Stewart and the rise of political comedy \nThe late-night political comedy show as we know it was developed and perfected by The Daily Show under Jon Stewart over the course of the 2000 presidential election. As the question of whether Al Gore or George W. Bush had won the electoral college wended its way through the Supreme Court, The Daily Show took on a central role: Stewart and his colleagues, including Colbert, were the TV personalities best equipped to talk about how fundamentally weird and confusing the whole thing was. \nAfter Bush emerged victorious, The Daily Show became even more crucial. Their skill set was uniquely suited to the Bush years. While the administration took on a pious pose of compassionate conservatism, it was lying to the American people and embroiling the country in an endless foreign war. Stewart and his cohorts knew how to call Bush out on their hypocrisy and be funny about it, too. They were young and edgy, making one of the most exciting shows on television. It felt as if they were telling the truth in a time when no one else was.\nStewart always insisted that he wasn’t a real journalist and The Daily Show wasn’t a real news show. Nonetheless, a 2007 poll from the Pew Research Center found Stewart tied for fourth place in a list of America’s most trusted journalists, along with Brian Williams, Tom Brokaw, Dan Rather, and Anderson Cooper. For lots of liberals, especially young ones, Stewart absolutely was a journalist, and so were the comedians he elevated.\nIn 2005, Colbert developed his own Daily Show spin-off, The Colbert Report. Even more biting than The Daily Show, The Colbert Report saw the host playing a parodic version of Bill O’Reilly, then the biggest star on Fox News. Like O’Reilly, Colbert’s character was pompous and swaggering, lapping up his audience’s applause and pontificating on “truthiness” and the American dream. In 2006, he headlined the White House Correspondent’s Dinner in character and ripped into Bush directly to his face, in a moment that Vanity Fair would say turned Colbert into a “folk hero for the left.”\nWith The Colbert Report an accepted institution, Colbert and Stewart developed a double act. They held a 2010 Rally to Restore Fear and/or Sanity, with Stewart pleading for sanity and Colbert for fear. In retrospect, those years would represent the zenith of their popularity.\nColbert was the first Stewart acolyte to get a Daily Show spin-off, but his wouldn’t be the last. John Oliver got his own show in 2014. Samantha Bee got hers in 2015. Hasan Minhaj got his in 2018. The 2010s saw The Daily Show model of news-focused political comedy spread across the landscape of television, no longer a scrappy upstart, but an institution, what we understood as what late-night television was supposed to look like. \nThere were two big problems with all that success. The first was that the Bush years were over. In 2008, Barack Obama became president, and while his administration had plenty of foibles for liberal comics to skewer, the central joke of the hypocrisy of neoconservatism was no longer available to them. The urgency of their comedy, the sense that they were meeting a moment as no one else could, began to fade away.\nThe second problem was that success meant that The Daily Show brand of comedy was no longer punching exclusively up. They couldn’t critique hidebound media institutions for failing to do their jobs anymore, because now they were media institutions. What else could it mean when, in 2015, Colbert took over The Late Show and became the face of CBS’s late-night lineup?\nHow late-night television lost its bite \nWhen Trump won the presidential election in 2016, part of the received wisdom was that this would be great for comedy. Trump, after all, was a joke. He would offer all those Daily Show graduates plenty of fodder for their routines. \nInstead, liberal comedy faltered. The skill set they had developed for the Bush years, the ripping away of pious lies to reveal the violent truth below, had no particular effect on a figure as shameless and straightforward as Trump. \nOne by one, the shows of the Daily Show alums began to topple. Patriot Act With Hasan Minhaj went in 2020. Full Frontal With Samantha Bee left in 2022. On The Daily Show itself, hosted from 2015 to 2022 by Trevor Noah, ratings toppled.\nColbert dropped his character to host The Late Show, but he criticized Trump often and vociferously as himself. All the same, his work didn’t feel particularly biting or urgent anymore. Young people, particularly young men, were more likely to find right-wing comedy to be edgy and transgressive.\n“If something was the height of fashion 20 years ago, that almost inversely makes it less likely to seem hip and cool at the moment,” the media critic Matt Sienkiewicz told me in 2022. “There’s a rebelliousness in the way people think of this right-wing comedy, right? Even if it really is regressive and pointing back to old dominant ideas. But it can be branded as being the opposite of Stephen Colbert crying about January 6 during his monologue, which is very much not cool to the teens.”\nThat’s part of what’s so striking about Paramount’s decision to cancel Colbert’s show in an apparent attempt to curry favor with Trump: Colbert’s work hasn’t felt dangerous in a long time. We’re a long way from that 2006 White House Correspondent’s Dinner, when Colbert delivered his jokes to a tense and scandalized crowd and Bush walked away furious. Colbert is the definition of a mainstream comedian now, and it doesn’t seem as though anyone has any illusions that the jokes he cracks in between celebrity glad-handing and crowd work are culturally fundamental. \nYet somehow, with a president this thin-skinned, and a corporate leadership this obsequious, Stephen Colbert has been rendered threatening once again. The man who’s too uncool for teenagers is, under this administration, just dangerous enough to fire.","summary":"On Thursday, CBS announced that it was going to cancel The Late Show With Stephen Colbert after Colbert’s contract ends in May 2026.

Trump, in a lawsuit, had alleged that 60 Minutes, the flagship news magazine at CBS, doctored an interview during the 2024 presidential campaign with his Democratic rival, Kamala Harris.\n\nColbert, a longtime critic of the president, called the network’s decision to settle “a big fat bribe” because of the pending merger, which needs approval from the Department of Justice and is valued at $8bn.\n\n“I absolutely love that Colbert’ got fired,” the president wrote in a post on his social media platform Truth Social.\n\n“His talent was even less than his ratings,” he added, before going after Colbert’s other two rivals, Jimmy Kimmel and Jimmy Fallon, saying that they are next, without evidence.\n\nContrary to the president’s claims, Colbert is performing well — his is the highest rated show in late night television — averaging 2.42 million viewers in the second quarter of 2025.\n\nThe cancellation also ended the tenure of the long-running late-night franchise, replacing the Pat Sajak show in 1993, and was first hosted by David Letterman.\n\nFinancial pressures\n\n“This is purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night. It is not related in any way to the show’s performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount,” CBS said in a statement provided to Al Jazeera.\n\nCBS previously cancelled another late-night show, After Midnight, hosted by comedian Taylor Tomlinson, after a two-year run.\n\nExperts believe there is merit to that argument.\n\n“The reality is the business of late night is not going anywhere that justifies the enormous salaries that this talent is paid and the costs that these productions have. Ultimately, if you’re producing late night, it is mostly going to be consumed on YouTube,” Andrew Rosen, founder of the media strategy firm Parqor, told Al Jazeera.\n\nThe show reportedly costs $100m to produce annually and loses about $40m in revenue, according to reporting from the outlet Puck.\n\n“They’ve [CBS] just maxed out the model for as long as they can and for a variety of reasons that I think probably have more to do with the economics of the merger with Skydance than they do with Trump,” Rosen added, referring to Paramount’s efforts to cut costs as it focuses to merge with Skydance.\n\nOn Wall Street, Paramount’s stock is up 0.2 percent as of 1pm in New York (17:00 GMT).\n\nPolitical timing\n\nThe announcement of the cancellation of the show comes as the Department of Justice considers the merger. Economics apart, the move is also being seen as political in nature.\n\n“The timing of it raises a lot of questions. To me, it is the politics of it, especially for broadcast legacy media,” Rodney Benson, professor, Department of Media, Culture, and Communication at New York University, told Al Jazeera.\n\nThe Trump White House has gone after news organisations and their parent media companies for what the administration says is coverage that is partisan in nature, including the $16m lawsuit that Paramount settled with Trump. In December, Disney-owned ABC News settled a defamation suit with a $15m donation to Trump’s library and issued a public apology over inaccurate on-air comments. There have also been cuts to public media and use of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to threaten the future of their broadcasting licenses.\n\n“Broadcast networks are regulated by the FCC. They have to have their licences renewed, and they can be, the government can go after them for what they define as news distortion. They’ve already raised that,” Benson added.\n\nDemocrats have called out the network for the cancellation of the show and alleged political reasoning.\n\n“CBS canceled Colbert’s show just THREE DAYS after Colbert called out CBS parent company Paramount for its $16M settlement with Trump — a deal that looks like bribery,” Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren said on social media platform X formerly known as Twitter.\n\n“Long-term financial trends could underlie this, but the timing suggests that if it was just financial, then they would have wanted to wait a bit, the optics are just horrible, so there must have been some pressure,” Benson added.\n\nSkydance, the company set to acquire Paramount, is led by David Ellison, who is the son of Larry Ellison, the Oracle CEO and a close Trump ally.\n\nIn April, David Ellison attended a UFC fight with the president alongside former confidante Elon Musk, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F Kennedy and Ted Cruz, among others.\n\nSkydance is also reportedly in talks to acquire The Free Press, an outlet that has been seen as right-wing and friendly to the president. In the last few days, it has published pieces called “Happy Independence Day, NPR” when US Congress voted to scrap public media funding and accusing NPR of liberal bias; and another “The Epstein Files Are Just a Sideshow” as the president rails against releasing files related to deceased sex offender Jeffery Epstein, who Trump has been pictured with.","summary":"Despite financial pressures on the late night TV model, experts say the timing suggests political motives.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/7/18/cbs-cancels-colberts-late-show-amid-pending-paramount-skydance-merger?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AFP__20250718__677U6BW__v1__HighRes__UsEntertainmentCbsLateShowColbert-1752859609.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-18 18:58:06","author":"Andy Hirschfeld,Apps Support","authors":["Andy Hirschfeld","Apps Support"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.088},{"id":343007528,"title":"Trump Celebrates ‘Late Show With Stephen Colbert’ Cancellation, Predicts Jimmy Kimmel is Next","text":"President Donald Trump reacted to CBS’ surprising move to cancel The Late Show With Stephen Colbert, hinting that other late-night hosts might face the same fate, particularly his frequent adversary, Jimmy Kimmel.\n\n“I thoroughly enjoy that Colbert got axed. His talent was even lower than his ratings,” Trump posted on Truth Social, according to Variety. “I’ve heard Jimmy Kimmel might be next. He’s even less talented than Colbert!”\n\nKimmel and Trump have been at odds for years. Trump not only criticized Kimmel’s performance as Oscars host in 2024 but also has been frequently targeted by Kimmel on Jimmy Kimmel Live, where the host has regularly denounced Trump’s political actions in recent months. Kimmel was visibly emotional after Trump’s 2024 presidential victory, describing it as a “terrible night” for democracy and mentioning he’s on Trump’s “enemies list.”\n\nTrump also took a shot at Jimmy Fallon while praising Fox News late night host Greg Gutfield. \n\n“Greg Gutfeld is better than all of them combined, including the Moron on NBC who ruined the once great Tonight Show,” he wrote.\n\nCBS announced it made the “financial decision” to cancel The Late Show in a press release shared Thursday (July 17). The show is set to end in May 2026. \n\n“We consider Stephen Colbert irreplaceable and will retire The Late Show franchise at that time. We are proud that Stephen called CBS home.

It is not related in any way to the show’s performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount.” \n\nThe decision comes just days after Colbert criticized CBS’ parent company for reaching a $16 million settlement with President Trump after Trump accused 60 Minutes of editing an interview with Kamala Harris to mislead voters during the presidential election. Paramount is currently in the middle of a merger with Skydance Media that will require approval from Trump’s administration. \n\n“I don’t know if anything — anything — will repair my trust in this company,” Colbert said on The Late Show earlier this week. “But, just taking a stab at it, I’d say $16 million would help.”\n\nKimmel wasted no time in speaking out in support of Colbert. “Love you Stephen.

But the bit prefaced a bombshell. Colbert revealed that he’d just been told that his show would end in May 2026. A chorus of boos reverberated through the studio audience. Colbert matched their energy: “Yeah, I share your feelings!” Moreover, the host explained, “It’s the end of The Late Show on CBS. I’m not being replaced. This is all just going away.” Running down a list of thank-yous, he sounded both mournful and characteristically magnanimous: “It is a fantastic job. I wish somebody else was getting it.”\n\nBy the time the announcement aired, the news had been ricocheting around the media for hours, the rare entertainment story that merited push notifications from major publications and timely reactions from high-profile politicians. One of the latter was Elizabeth Warren, who fired off a scorching social media post. “CBS canceled Colbert’s show just THREE DAYS after Colbert called out CBS parent company Paramount for its $16M settlement with Trump—a deal that looks like bribery,” the senator wrote. “America deserves to know if his show was canceled for political reasons.” The timing of The Late Show’s demise is indeed concerning, and if the lawsuit did influence the network’s decision to can Colbert—a perennial Trump critic—the implications for free speech in cultural commentary as well as in comedy are nothing short of terrifying. Still, as that story develops, it’s also worth acknowledging what we know for sure: The end of The Late Show is the biggest nail yet in the coffin of a dying late-night talk show format.\n\nSenator Warren is hardly alone in making the connection between Colbert’s firing and Paramount’s settlement with the President. To summarize the facts behind the furor: On July 1, Paramount Global agreed to pay $16 million to settle Trump’s lawsuit alleging that CBS’s flagship news magazine 60 Minutes edited an October 2024 interview with then-VP and presidential candidate Kamala Harris with the aim of persuading viewers to vote for her. Because the suit was widely seen as baseless, with legal experts and Paramount itself lining up to insist it had no merit, the news of the network’s capitulation sent shockwaves through the media. As First Amendment expert Amy Kristin Sanders told TIME earlier this month: “CBS selected clips from the interview that they thought would be the best to inform their audience—a very common journalistic practice… It's been recognized by the Supreme Court as the process of editorial discretion or editorial decision making and it's protected by the First Amendment.”\n\nIt didn’t escape widespread notice, either, that Paramount’s concession coincided with the company’s merger with David Ellison’s Skydance Media, for which it will need the federal government’s approval. This was the aspect of the settlement that seemed to most offend Colbert, who returned from a summer hiatus on Monday with some strong words in criticism of what he described as Trump’s “nuisance lawsuit”: “As someone who has always been a proud employee of this network, I am offended. And I don’t know if anything will ever repair my trust in this company—but just taking a stab at it, I’d say $16 million would help,” the host quipped at the top of his monologue. “I believe that this kind of complicated financial settlement with a sitting government official has a technical name in legal circles—it’s big fat bribe.”\n\nTo hear Paramount and CBS execs tell it, Colbert’s speech had nothing to do with The Late Show’s cancellation. “This is purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night,” they maintained. “It is not related in any way to the show’s performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount.” For his part, commenting on Truth Social Friday morning, the President further inserted himself in the narrative. “I absolutely love that Colbert’ got fired. His talent was even less than his ratings,” Trump wrote. “I hear Jimmy Kimmel is next. Has even less talent than Colbert!” \n\nRegardless of what the full story might be—and of any disagreement one might have with POTUS’s estimation of Colbert or skepticism one might harbor that he possesses inside knowledge of Kimmel’s fate—both statements capture the ominous outlook for late night in general. Network late-night shows have been in ratings freefall for years now, with culprits ranging from the rise of streaming to the supremacy of social video platforms among the young adults who could once be counted on to tune in at midnight to the long pandemic hiatuses and subsequent socially distanced lockdown comebacks that broke many viewers of a nightly habit.\n\nThis shift has manifested, over the last few years, in broadcasters cutting corners, from NBC snipping the Friday installment of Jimmy Fallon’s Tonight Show to CBS scrapping The Late Late Show after the departure of James “Carpool Karaoke” Corden. It has also led to conservative decision-making in the late-night realm; as nice as it has been to see Jon Stewart back on The Daily Show every Monday, his return was basically a tacit admission that the onetime cultural juggernaut could not survive without him. And it has accelerated despite such experiments in cultivating Gen Z audiences as NBC’s A Little Late with Lilly Singh, whose host made her name on YouTube, and CBS’s own Late Late Show replacement After Midnight, helmed by 31-year-old comedian Taylor Tomlinson—both canceled after less than two years on the air. \n\nThe thing is, as many commentators have already pointed out, by the diminished standards of network late night in 2025, Colbert is having a good year. He’s beating his broadcast competitors, Kimmel and Fallon, in the ratings. Just this week, The Late Show scored yet another Emmy nomination (even as the TV Academy snubbed late night’s most promising debut in ages: Netflix’s Everybody’s Live with John Mulaney). At a moment when late-night programs’ presence on the internet is considered a crucial indicator of their brand value and cultural impact, it boasts nearly 10 million YouTube subscribers and has recently gone viral on TikTok with interviews of such Gen-Z-relevant figures as Zohran Mamdani (3.9 million views) and Megan Stalter (1.8 million views). Not that Colbert, despite his vocal opposition to Trump, is some kind of outspoken lefty. When Mamdani appeared alongside his also-progressive opponent-slash-ally, Brad Lander, in advance of June’s New York City mayoral primary, Colbert hastened to clarify: “I am not endorsing either one of you.” Then he grilled Mamdani with centrist criticisms of the candidate’s embrace of democratic socialism and support for Palestinians. \n\nAll of which is to say that, within the realm of broadcast late night, Colbert is an outlier only insofar as he’s doing better than the competition. And yet The Late Show—which has been airing for nearly 32 years, originally under the envelope-pushingly weird leadership of David Letterman—is the first of the three big network late-night dynasties to be canceled. When it goes dark next May, only Kimmel and Fallon will remain in the 11:35 timeslot. Even if you’re convinced that Trump’s preferences are weighing on every entertainment exec’s every programming choice, don’t be surprised if 2016’s hair-ruffle heard ‘round the world doesn’t save Fallon, who has been trending at the bottom of the heap with roughly half as many viewers as Colbert. Whatever sealed The Late Show’s fate, the result is an acceleration of late night’s demise from slow decline to full-on apocalypse mode. \n\nBecause for a company of Paramount’s or NBCUniversal’s or ABC parent Disney’s size and vulnerability—given an ailing entertainment industry—every decision is ultimately financial. That would certainly include any decision based on the “challenging backdrop in late night” (I assume that since the statement explicitly disputes that “the show’s performance” and “content” played any role, this vague turn of phrase refers to the expense of making The Late Show, the outlook for future seasons, or both). It would also include any decision made in hopes of appeasing the Trump administration. What is the Skydance merger, after all, but a financial arrangement aimed at improving Paramount’s financial prospects? None of these factors are mutually exclusive. Nor would a “purely financial” choice to end The Late Show, thereby eliminating one of vanishingly few outlets for political commentary, make its cancellation any less destructive to the discourse.","summary":"Even if Trump didn't influence CBS's decision to end 'The Late Show,' its effects on political comedy will be dire","url":"https://time.com/7303604/stephen-colbert-cancellation-late-night-comedy/","image":"https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2221626038.jpg?w=1200&h=675","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-18 18:38:39","author":"Judy Berman","authors":["Judy Berman"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.412},{"id":342997002,"title":"Stephen Colbert’s Late Show CANCELLED After 33 Years | Trump Celebrates, CBS Under Fire | N18G","text":"Last Updated:July 18, 2025, 23:56 IST Videos\n\nBREAKING: CBS has announced that The Late Show with Stephen Colbert will go off-air in May 2026 after a 33-year run — despite strong ratings.

This is a decrease of one percentage point compared to the previous week and down from 49 percent right after his inauguration.\n\nIn contrast, a new poll by the Daily Mail, in collaboration with JL Partners, reflects a different trend. It shows the president’s approval rating rising to 48 percent, an increase of one percentage point from June and marking his highest rating since May.\n\nBack in late April, the Daily Mail poll recorded the president’s lowest approval at 45 percent. The most recent survey was conducted on July 9 and 10, involving a sample of over 1,000 registered voters, with a margin of error of +/- three percentage points.\n\nJames Johnson, JL Partners co-founder, tells the Daily Mail in an exclusive interview that the discrepancy between the polls is telling.\n\n‘Remember: the pollsters who got the election wrong are telling you that Trump’s approval is falling off a cliff. They’re wrong,’ Johnson says. ‘Trump’s support is remarkably solid.’\n\nIndeed, the Daily Mail’s general election poll was the most accurate in the country forecasting Trump’s victory over former Vice President Kamala Harris, beating out 20 less accurate major pollsters, eight of which predicted Trump would lose the popular vote.\n\nJ.L. Partners/Daily Mail’s final election day poll showing a 50 percent to 47 percent Trump win. The final popular vote tally was Trump at 49.8 percent versus Harris at 48.3 percent.\n\nJohnson says ‘a surge in support among men, Republicans and independent voters’ is buoying the president’s approval rating.\n\nSupport for the president among Republicans is up five points since late June and seven points among voters not affiliated with a party, those typically thought of as independents.\n\nFifty-four percent of men now say they approve of the job Trump is doing, a six-point improvement from June.\n\nJohnson calls this ‘modest uptick’ a ‘subtle but important shift in voter sentiment.’\n\n‘Stable ratings among middle-aged and older voters, coupled with renewed strength among independents, suggest he’s regaining footing in the center ground,’ he adds.\n\nHowever, there are signs of troubling brewing for the Republican president. Only 41 percent of woman approve of the job that Trump is doing, hovering around lows recorded in April.\n\nThe 13-point gender gap, Johnson said, is ‘the widest seen in months.’ This finding, paired with low support for Trump among young voters, could spell trouble.\n\n‘For now, the data points to a candidate with a high floor of support, and just enough movement among swing groups to keep things competitive,’ said Johnson.\n\n‘Trump remains strong with his base but – as you would expect – polarizing elsewhere. Democratic approval has fallen further to just 14 percent (the second lowest of the year), and among younger voters, numbers remain in the low 40s at best.’\n\nPerhaps the most surprising finding in the Daily Mail poll – conducted three days after the release of the Justice Department investigation into Jeffrey Epstein and files associated with his sex trafficking prosecution – Trump’s standing among his base supporters is firm. \n\nIn the week since the Department of Justice confirmed Epstein’s death was a suicide and claimed that they are not in possession of any so-called ‘client list,’ some prominent MAGA figures have questions the administration’s handling the issue.\n\nTrump has now repeatedly dismissed questions about the ‘Epstein files.’ Trump has called swirling theories of an alleged cover-up a ‘hoax’ and supporters who believe the claims ‘weaklings.’\n\nYet, this survey, shows the MAGA crowd is undeterred.\n\n‘In this data there’s no immediate sign that Trump’s Epstein-related comments have damaged his standing with his base,’ Johnson said.\n\n‘That suggests the base is either unbothered by the issue, unaware of it, or rallying behind him despite the controversy. Perhaps that will change if it rages on, and it’s one we will be watching – but there’s no sign yet.’\n\nHowever, that support does not apparently extend to all members of the Trump administration.\n\nMore than one in five respondents who voted for Trump in the 2024 election say Bondi should resign, while 43 percent of Trump voters back her. Another 36 percent didn’t express an opinion either way.\n\nIndeed, Bondi fares worse with the general population (37 percent say Bondi should step down and only 26 percent believe she should remain in the job), but that’s a significant loss of support among her likely political allies.\n\nThe survey also asked respondents how favorably they view other members of the Trump administration.\n\nFirst Lady Melania Trump had an approval rating of 41 percent, Secretary of State Marco Rubio earned 36 percent and US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth – who has faced scrutiny in recent months of gaffs, sits at 30 percent.\n\nBillionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk – who recently left the administration, stoked public anger over the Epstein files and sparred with Trump over the passage of a recent budget-busting spending bill and – received a 34 percent approval rating.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nA new Daily Mail poll stands in sharp contrast to a flood&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: New Poll Reveals Impact of Epstein Scandal on Trump&#8217;s Presidency first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/new-poll-reveals-impact-of-epstein-scandal-on-trumps-presidency/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Shock-impact-of-Epstein-scandal-on-Trumps-presidency-new-poll.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-18 18:18:20","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.031},{"id":343041022,"title":"Man accused of stockpiling bombs, using Biden photo for target practice, pleads guilty","text":"A Virginia man pleaded guilty Friday in a federal case that accused him of stockpiling the largest number of finished explosives in FBI history and of using then-President Joe Biden’s photo for target practice.\n\nBrad Spafford pleaded guilty in federal court in Norfolk to possession of an unregistered short barrel rifle and possession of an unregistered destructive device, according to court documents. Each count carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. His sentencing is scheduled for December. \n\nFederal authorities said they seized about 150 pipe bombs and other homemade devices last fall at Spafford’s home in Isle of Wight County, which is northwest of Norfolk.\n\nThe investigation into Spafford began in 2023 when an informant told authorities that Spafford was stockpiling weapons and ammunition, according to court documents. The informant, a friend and member of law enforcement, told authorities that Spafford was using pictures of then-President Joe Biden for target practice and that “he believed political assassinations should be brought back,” prosecutors wrote.\n\nTwo weeks after the assassination attempt of then-presidential candidate Donald Trump in 2024, Spafford told the informant, “bro I hope the shooter doesn’t miss Kamala,\" according to court documents. Former Vice President Kamala Harris had recently announced she was running for president. On around the same day, Spafford told the informant that he was pursuing a sniper qualification at the local gun range, court records stated. \n\nNumerous law enforcement officers and bomb technicians searched the property in December.\n\nSpafford stored a highly unstable explosive material in a garage freezer next to “Hot Pockets and frozen corn on the cob,” according to court documents. Investigators also said they found explosive devices in an unsecured backpack labeled “#NoLivesMatter.”\n\nSpafford has remained in jail since his arrest last December. U.S. District Judge Arenda L. Wright Allen ruled against his release last January, writing that Spafford has “shown the capacity for extreme danger.” She also noted that Spafford lost three fingers in an accident involving homemade explosives in 2021.\n\nSpafford had initially pleaded not guilty to the charges in January. Defense attorneys had argued at the time that Spafford, who is married and a father of two young daughters, works a steady job as a machinist and has no criminal record.\n\nDefense attorney Jeffrey Swartz said at Spafford’s January detention hearing that investigators had gathered information on him since January 2023, during which Spafford never threatened anyone.\n\n“And what has he done during those two years?” Swartz said. “He purchased a home. He’s raised his children. He’s in a great marriage. He has a fantastic job, and those things all still exist for him.”\n\nInvestigators, however, said they had limited knowledge of the homemade bombs until an informant visited Spafford’s home, federal prosecutors wrote in a filing.\n\n“But once the defendant stated on a recorded wire that he had an unstable primary explosive in the freezer in October 2024, the government moved swiftly,” prosecutors wrote.","summary":"A Virginia man has pleaded guilty in a federal case that accused him of stockpiling the largest number of finished explosives in FBI history","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/joe-biden-norfolk-kamala-harris-donald-trump-fbi-b2791860.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/18/19/Virginia_Explosives_Arrest_97965.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-18 18:09:56","author":"Ben Finley","authors":["Ben Finley"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.074},{"id":343031484,"title":"Democrats are using Trump's playbook and going after Fox News","text":"Congressional Democrats are demanding answers from Fox News after the conservative network edited an interview with President Donald Trump about Jeffrey Epstein, his associate and convicted sex offender.\n\nIn a 2024 interview, Fox aired an interview with Trump and Rachel Campos-Duffy in which he appeared to unequivocally say he would declassify files associated with the Epstein investigation, the 9/11 attacks, and the assassination of President John F.

Did Paramount fold?","text":"A shocking change in late-night TV. A salacious story about Jeffrey Epstein.What do they have in common? Donald Trump.Specifically, Trump's use of the Presidency to bend media companies to his will. It's a power he's used so effectively in his second term that any threat he makes has to be taken seriously. And that any decision a big media company makes will be seen through a Trump-colored lens, regardless of the facts — which ends up increasing that power.In the case of Paramount's call to end Stephen Colbert's late-night show, there's no evidence that the company's current owner, Shari Redstone, made the move to appease Trump by kiboshing a TV host who routinely rips into the president. The same goes for Larry Ellison and David Ellison, who plan to buy Paramount via their Skydance studio.Paramount itself took pains to say the decision was \"purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night.\" And as we constantly note here, late-night TV — and all TV — is very much challenged: Ratings for just about any conventional TV programming that isn't the NFL are shrinking. And the viewers who watch late-night shows like Colbert's have been dwindling, and aging, for years.Subtract Trump from the story, and this would be just another signpost telling us that the internet has supplanted TV. And that the TV industry doesn't know how to deal with it other than a never-ending series of cuts and garage sales.\"Over the next few years, we expect virtually all linear TV programming outside of sports and news to shift to catalog content and reruns of what appeared on streaming; there simply will not be a business model to support original entertainment programming on linear TV,\" Lightshed analyst Rich Greenfield wrote in a research note Friday morning.The thing is, Trump is all over the story.That's because Redstone has already paid a $16 million ransom to Trump, in order to settle a seemingly spurious lawsuit he filed about a \"60 Minutes\" interview with Kamala Harris last fall.And the Ellisons, who plan to buy Paramount if the Trump-controlled Federal Communications Commission signs off on the deal this fall, are already deeply enmeshed with Trump.Larry Ellison, who Forbes says is now the second-richest man in the world, is a longtime Trump donor whose Oracle software company is doing lots of Trump-blessed business these days. His son David, who will run Paramount, has been actively seeking Trump's blessing — which is presumably why he was spotted hanging out with Trump ringside at two UFC matches this spring.So is there a world where Redstone agreed to move out Colbert as a way to placate Trump — or to do so on behalf of the Ellisons, for the same reasons?So far, there's zero reporting out there making that case. But plenty of people immediately wondered out loud if it was so, including Senators Elizabeth Warren and Adam Schiff, who both put out statements Thursday night wondering if Colbert's show was killed for \"political reasons.\"(Paramount declined to comment beyond its initial press release. A rep for Skydance, the Ellison-owned company that will control Paramount if the sale goes through, also declined to comment. Trump, meanwhile, applauded Colbert's cancellation: \"I absolutely love that Colbert' got fired. His talent was even less than his ratings. hear Jimmy Kimmel is next,\" he posted.)But if you're looking for more evidence that Trump expects America's media companies to do what he wants, you didn't have to look very hard on Thursday.After The Wall Street Journal published a story about a racy poem and drawing Trump allegedly gave to disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, Trump announced that he had told both Emma Tucker, the Journal's editor, and Rupert Murdoch, who owns the paper via his News Corp., not to publish the report.Because they did, Trump said Thursday night via his Truth Social platform, he would sue Murdoch and his publications. \"I look forward to getting Rupert Murdoch to testify in my lawsuit against him and his \"pile of garbage\" newspaper, the WSJ.,\" Trump added in a follow-up post Friday morning.Will Trump actually do that?On the one hand, Trump is well-known for threatening media companies with lawsuits, and throughout his career has sometimes followed up. He's never actually filed a suit while he was president, however. And up until last year, he didn't have much luck with the suits he did file.That changed last fall, after Trump's reelection. Since then, we've seen a series of media and tech companies settle Trump's suits with multimillion-dollar payouts — settlements most legal experts say those companies would never have offered if he didn't have the power of the presidency behind him.Which in my mind gives his current threat much more currency — even though it would end up pitting Trump against the man who also owns and controls Fox News, an outlet Trump watches constantly, and uses to staff his administration.There's no point in speculating what would happen if Trump does follow through with his suit (the White House press office, asked for comment, referred me to Trump's Truth Social posts). But we don't have to speculate about Trump's presence in media boardrooms and everywhere else — he's in everyone's heads, whether they like it or not.","summary":"A shocking change in late-night TV.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (6%) could be considered “household names” at the national level. \n\nMoreover, the 2028 Democratic National Convention is roughly three years away. It is extremely difficult for voters to know now who they will prefer then, thus, they often default to the familiar face.\n\nIn the summer of 2005 – analogous to right now in the 2028 presidential cycle – Gallup released a poll among Democratic primary voters. \n\nHillary Clinton (40%) was dominating the field, trailed by John Kerry (16%) and John Edwards (15%). The eventual winner – former President Barack Obama – was not even considered a serious enough contender to be included in the poll. \n\nAll of this is to say that it is entirely possible that the Democrats’ eventual nominee is not even among the list of more than 20 candidates polled by Echelon Insights. \n\nUnderscoring the necessity for Harris to discount this poll is something I discussed in these pages earlier this month. \n\nA separate 2028 poll from Emerson, reported Buttigieg (16%) leading Harris (13%). \n\nAt the time, I wrote that Emerson’s data points to a wide-open race for the party’s nomination, and Echelon’s poll showing Harris with a lead reinforces the conclusion that there is no established Democratic front runner, including Harris.\n\nFinally, were Harris to read this poll as a desire for her candidacy in 2028, its highly likely that she will confront many – or all – of the same challenges that hobbled her 2024 candidacy. \n\nBack on the national stage, voters would be reminded of Harris’ position in the previous Biden administration, which was deeply unpopular at its end. \n\nOne can easily imagine how awkward the primary would be when Harris was forced to defend the Biden administration – and her role in it – against competitors from her own party.\n\nThroughout her campaign, Harris struggled to separate herself from former President Biden throughout her campaign, nor was she able to truly define a wholly new platform or agenda for a Harris presidency.\n\nAnd, when Harris did take decisive stands on various policies, she was seen as either too far-left or inauthentic. \n\nTaken together, it appears that Harris’ best bet for a continued political future would be to enter the race for California Governor. \n\nShe is almost certain to emerge from the state’s jungle primary either against a much lesser-known Democrat or a Republican, against both of whom Harris would be the clear favorite. \n\nAs Governor, Harris would be able to gain experience in an executive position, remain politically relevant, and build a platform if she chose to run in 2032, when she’d only be 67 years old.\n\nIn that same vein, with the Democratic Party as a whole facing its own crossroads in the wake of Zohran Mamdani’s primary win in New York City, Harris would be able to survey shifting political landscapes and decide what type of candidate she wants to be in 2032.\n\nFurther, despite California’s shift to the center on certain issues such as crime and homelessness, Harris’ more left-leaning platform would not be the same obstacle in California that it would be in a national election.\n\nUltimately, nobody – possibly even including Harris – knows what the former vice president will decide, and few could fault her for wanting a redo after the unprecedented circumstances that led to her presidential candidacy. \n\nHowever, if Harris hopes to have another shot as a truly viable candidate, her best course of action is undoubtedly to try her hand at the job in Sacramento. \n\nViewed in that light, Harris’ advisors would best serve her by convincing her that Echelon’s poll is a flash in the pan, not a sign of genuine desire for her return

Gavin Newsom declined to give a direct answer when asked what age is too young for children to undergo transgender surgeries. \n\nSpeaking on former Navy SEAL Shawn Ryan’s podcast, Newsom called the topic a “major problem” for the Democratic Party but stopped short of explaining his personal stance. \n\n“Yeah, I mean look, now that I have a nine-year-old, just became nine, come on, man,” Newsom said when asked whether children as young as eight should be treated.\n\nJamie Reed, a self-described Democrat and a transgender clinic whistleblower, said she wasn’t satisfied with the governor’s response on “Fox & Friends.” \n\n“He does not answer the question,” Reed said. “And for a lifelong Democrat like myself, I am incredibly disappointed that the party, this person who wants to be the leader of the party, is still not able to answer the basic science questions.” \n\nDuring the podcast, Newsom suggested that the debate around transgender surgeries for minors likely played a “very significant” role in the 2024 election and may have hurt Vice President Kamala Harris’ bid for the presidency. \n\nReed said Newsom’s hesitation to clarify his stance may be linked to a broader lack of education on the controversial health issue.\n\n“I think part of why he pivots and doesn’t answer the question is because the best answer from the Democrats right now needs to be first an apology,” she said. \n\n“We got this wrong. We have hurt children and families, and we are sorry.”\n\nThe issue of transgender treatments for minors, while a rare occurrence in the United States, has been a heated debate between the Trump administration and California.\n\nIn February, California Attorney General Rob Bonta released a memo reminding hospitals and federally funded healthcare providers in California that they need to continue offering gender treatments, such as hormone therapy and surgeries for transgender youths.\n\nThe statement was in response to the Trump administration issuing a directive that could freeze or stop federal funding to programs that provide this type of care. \n\nReed accused Newsom of minimizing the seriousness of the issue by not having a stronger position on the topic. \n\n“Gavin acts like, in this interview, he doesn’t understand what’s going on in his own state,” she said. “How could he run for president if he doesn’t even understand the policies and how they impact families in his state?”\n\nIn 2022, Newsom declared California a sanctuary state for families seeking the treatments for minors. He signed the bill as other states moved to ban such treatment for minors, including Tennessee, which at the time passed a law prohibiting it for young people who hadn’t experienced puberty.","summary":"California Gov. Gavin Newsom declined to give a direct answer when asked what age is too young for children to undergo transgender surgeries. ","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/07/18/media/gender-clinic-whistleblower-calls-out-gavin-newsom-for-dodging-question-on-treatment-for-8-year-olds/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/108377853.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-18 17:30:02","author":"Fox News","authors":["Fox News"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.5},{"id":342981958,"title":"Trump Mocks Colbert Following CBS Departure","text":"President Donald Trump trolled Late Show host Stephen Colbert after CBS pulled the plug on the long-running show. \n\n‘I absolutely love that Colbert’ got fired,’ Trump posted to Truth Social Friday morning. ‘His talent was even less than his ratings.’ \n\n ‘I hear Jimmy Kimmel is next,’ the president continued. ‘Has even less talent than Colbert!’ \n\n‘Greg Gutfeld is better than all of them combined, including the Moron on NBC who ruined the once great Tonight Show,’ Trump added. \n\nThe ‘moron’ in question Tonight Show host Jimmy Fallon. \n\nAmong the late night shows, Colbert had the highest ratings. \n\nHe took over the franchise in 2015, which had originally been helmed by David Letterman.\n\nColbert gained fame through his Comedy Central program, The Colbert Report, where he impersonated a conservative commentator, inspired by personalities like Bill O’Reilly from Fox News’ The O’Reilly Factor. \n\nHe and The Daily Show’s Jon Stewart, who was on right before Colbert’s timeslot, captured the attention of liberal audiences. \n\nWhen Colbert took over the Late Show, he dropped his conservative caricature act, allowing his left-leaning politics to show openly. \n\nThree days before Colbert and the Late Show were axed, the comedian was publicly critical of Paramount’s decision to pay Trump $16 million to settle a lawsuit over the editing of a 60 Minutes interview that featured the president’s ex-rival, former Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris. \n\nParamount said the money would pay for the president’s legal fees and that any leftover money would go toward Trump’s future presidential library fund. \n\nParamount Global, which owns CBS, is in the middle of merging with Skydance Media, founded by David Ellison, the son of Oracle’s Larry Ellison. \n\nLarry Ellison has been a Trump supporter for years. \n\nThe deal needs the approval of the federal government. \n\n‘As someone who has always been a proud employee of this network, I’m offended,’ Colbert said. ‘And I don’t know if anything will ever repair my trust in this company.’\n\n‘But just taking a stab at it, I’d say $16 million would help,’ Colbert joked. \n\n He then referred to the settlement as a ‘big fat bribe.’\n\nIn a statement, CBS said the decision to end the Late Show with Colbert was ‘purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night.’ \n\nDemocrats are skeptical. \n\n‘Just finished taping with Stephen Colbert who announced his show was cancelled.

Colbert, who replaced David Letterman as host of The Late Show in September 2015, said he was \"grateful\" for being given a chair and a \"beautiful theater to call home,\" as well as his viewers from \"all around the world.\"\n\n CBS' cancellation comes just days after the talk show host criticized the network's parent company, Paramount, for its July 3 $16 million settlement with President Donald Trump, who alleged that CBS News' 60 Minutes deceptively edited an interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris. Meanwhile, Paramount is in the midst of a merger with entertainment company Skydance — a deal that will need approval from the Trump administration.\n\n In a statement from CBS shared with PEOPLE, the network said that the cancellation is \"not related in any way to the show’s performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount.\"\n\n So, why is The Late Show with Stephen Colbert ending? Here's what to know about its shocking cancellation.\n\n Why is The Late Show with Stephen Colbert ending? \n\n After Colbert shared the news with his audience, fans were left wondering why the show was being canceled, despite high ratings. (Just days before it was canceled, The Late Show with Stephen Colbert received an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Talk Series.)\n\n CBS' statement said it was \"purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night.\"\n\n \"Our admiration, affection, and respect for the talents of Stephen Colbert and his incredible team made this agonizing decision even more difficult,\" the statement read. \"Stephen has taken CBS late night by storm with cutting-edge comedy, a must-watch monologue and interviews with leaders in entertainment, politics, news and newsmakers across all areas.\"\n\n The network noted that his show had been \"#1 in late night for nine straight seasons,\" calling his broadcast a \"staple of the nation's zeitgeist.\"\n\n Will anyone replace Stephen Colbert on The Late Show? \n\n During his announcement, Colbert revealed that he was not being replaced, as The Late Show was ending in its entirety.\n\n \"It's not just the end of our show, but it's the end of The Late Show on CBS. I'm not being replaced,\" he said. \"This is all just going away.\"\n\n Colbert went on to describe it as a \"fantastic job,\" adding, \"I wish somebody else was getting it.\"\n\n When is the final episode of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert? \n\n Colbert shared that the network will be ending The Late Show in May, meaning the final episodes will air during the 2025-2026 TV season.\n\n What has Stephen Colbert said about his departure? \n\n During his July 17 broadcast, the crowd began booing just after Colbert announced the cancellation news. \"Yeah, I share your feelings,\" he responded.\n\n After saying that CBS has been \"great partners,\" he shared a heartfelt message to the crowd about his past decade as host.\n\n \"I am extraordinarily, deeply grateful to the 200 people who work here,\" he said. \"We get to do this show for each other every day, all day, and I've had the pleasure and the responsibility of sharing what we do every day with you in front of this camera for the last 10 years.\"\n\n How has the public responded to The Late Show with Stephen Colbert's cancellation? \n\n After Colbert posted his broadcast announcement on Instagram, messages of sorrow (and support!) flooded onto the platform by colleagues and fans alike.\n\n Actress Rachel Zegler commented, \"i am extremely sad. i adore you, stephen,\" while Severance star Adam Scott added, \"Love you Stephen. This is absolute b-------, and I for one am looking forward to the next 10 months of shows. ✊😡💔.\"\n\n Meanwhile, Jimmy Kimmel re-posted Colbert's announcement to his Instagram Stories, writing, \"Love you Stephen.\"\n\n He also had a message for the network: \"F--- you and all your Sheldons CBS,\" he wrote.\n\n Jimmy Fallon also shared his disappointment on his Instagram Stories, writing, \"I'm just as shocked as everyone. Stephen is one of the sharpest, funniest hosts to ever do it.\"\n\n He continued, \"I really thought I'd ride this out with him for years to come. ... I'm sure whatever he does next will be just as brilliant.\"\n\n Talk show host Andy Cohen weighed in on the news to Deadline, saying, \"I think it’s a sad day for late-night television.\"\n\n \"I think it’s a sad day for CBS. I think Stephen Colbert is a singular talent. He’s going to have an incredible next chapter,\" he said. \"I can’t believe CBS is turning off the lights at 11:30 after the local news. I’m stunned.

In 2024, President Trump — who has repeatedly bemoaned his late-night coverage — said CBS “should terminate his contract.”\n\nNow, in 2025, CBS has said that it is canceling Colbert’s show at the end of its season, next May. Executives stressed, in the announcement, that the cut was “purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night. It is not related in any way to the show’s performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount.”\n\nIs that the truth, or merely truthy?\n\nThere is good reason that CBS would need to offer that assurance. The network’s parent company, Paramount, just this month settled a lawsuit from President Trump, over the editing of a “60 Minutes” interview with Kamala Harris, for $16 million. At the same time, Paramount was hoping to close a multibillion-dollar merger with the company Skydance, which required the approval of the Trump administration.","summary":"Maybe the “Late Show” decision is purely financial.

He also took a swipe at his Paramount bosses on-air for accepting what he presented as a 'big fat bribe' from the president Monday. \n\nThe parties reached a $16 million settlement in a suit filed by Trump earlier this month. That is only slightly more than the $15 million Colbert is said to earn annually for his show. \n\nThe suit had accused Paramount, CBS, and its flagship show 60 Minutes of deceptively editing an interview with Kamala Harris weeks before the election. The decision to make a deal was widely seen as necessary to receiving FCC approval.\n\nWarren, 76, wrote: 'CBS canceled Colbert’s show just THREE DAYS after Colbert called out CBS parent company Paramount for its $16M settlement with Trump – a deal that looks like bribery.\n\n'America deserves to know if his show was canceled for political reasons.'\n\nIn another post, Warren appeared to accuse Trump of 'what looks like corruption in plain sight,' rattling off a list of companies he's squeezed settlements out of via what some have criticized as baseless, weaponized lawsuits.\n\n'Paramount/CBS: $16 MILLION; Meta: $22 MILLION; Disney/ABC: $15 MILLION; X: $10 MILLION,' Warren wrote, also bringing up up the $400million luxury jet gifted to Trump earlier this year.\n\n'Other special interests: unknown MILLIONS; Total: Roughly half a BILLION dollars,' she continued.\n\nThe post was published prior to the announcement revealing Colbert's show will soon be cancelled.\n\nColbert - the successor to late night legend David Letterman - delivered the news on-air as well, three days after taking C-Suiters to task for their settlement with the president. \n\n'Next year will be our last season.

Roy Cooper, 68, is the favorite of many Democratic supporters and leaders and has not yet declared an intention or declined. The Republican field is wide open, with freshman U.S. Reps. Pat Harrigan, 38, and Brad Knott, 39, carving respective paths on Capitol Hill and offering a youthful turn to compliment 53-year-old U.S. Sen. Ted Budd.\n\nThere’s no dispute Cooper is investing time and resources into the possibility. How far, such as campaign teams, key donors and websites, are considered probable though unconfirmed by those who could be granted authority to speak about them.\n\nVeteran state politicos Dr. Chris Cooper – no relation to the former governor – and Dr. Michael Bitzer agree a “no” to the idea would be for personal reasons such as Beltway gridlock, proximity to retirement, and what he could actually do for the state. The latter has been his calling card forever.\n\nAnd Dallas Woodhouse, another veteran state politico, adds respectfully yet bluntly for all he’s done that his party and supporters admire, “Even if he wins, Democrats are likely to be in the minority for at least his first couple of years. He inevitably will end up less popular. He can’t equivocate. He’s got to vote with Democrats or against Democrats.”\n\nGary Pearce, a journalist, author and longtime associate of the esteemed Hunt family, knows Democrats well. He wrote this week he is without inside information and that Cooper will run in a “Yes he will” blog piece.\n\nEven before Tillis’ retirement announcement, the seat was one of two in the Senate for Republicans considered most vulnerable to change in the midterms either within party or to flip blue. Rep. Susan Collins, R-Maine, is in the other.\n\nDemocrats beyond North Carolina – Cooper was a possibiilty as vice president or cabinet member and the last speaker before Kamala Harris at last year’s national party convention – see opportunity for a chamber with 53 Republicans, 45 of their party and two independents caucusing with them.\n\n“Accomplishing legislative goals is something that seems to be more fleeting nowadays, and policy considerations tend to be about messaging for the next election than addressing current issues or concerns, unless they are in a mega-package and party unity reigns,” said Bitzer, chairman of the Department of Politics at Catawba College and referencing the recently signed budget reconciliation bill. “He also may be thinking about the fact that if he wins next year, he would be 70 years old upon entering the Senate. There’s some discussion about generational leadership within the Democratic Party, but I think Cooper has garnered the respect of a wide range of Democrats that it wouldn’t be an issue, as with others in the party.”\n\nChris Cooper, director of the Haire Institute for Public Policy at Western Carolina University, said the tea leaves on Roy Cooper running are only slightly more reliable than a coin toss.\n\n“As Thom Tillis’ retirement suggests, serving the U.S. Senate isn’t all that fun these days,” the professor says. “And, although Cooper is not, by any stretch ‘too old,’ especially in U.S. Senate terms, he would be 69 when elected and 75 at the end of his first term were he to be successful.\n\n“Sure, he could run for a second term, but that would bring him into his 80s. Does he want to spend his last good years as one of 100 members of the U.S. Senate – almost certainly in the minority party for at least the first two years? Only Roy Cooper knows the answer.”\n\nWoodhouse, former leader of the North Carolina Republican Party and now state executive director for American Majority-Action, expects him to run.\n\nAS TRUMP’S GRIP TIGHTENS, THE POLITICAL CENTER THINS OUT\n\n“Democrats nationally are far to the left of North Carolina,” Woodhouse told The Center Square. “If he does this, and I think he’s going to, the best-case scenario isn’t very good.\n\n“I expect he’s going to run.

The iconic late-night series, which ran for over 30 years between both Colbert and David Letterman's tenures as host, will end in May 2026.Predictably, no one is happier about the news than President Donald Trump, whom Colbert frequently critiques.

CBS News called the suit \"completely without merit,\" a statement which Colbert called out in his monologue.\"As someone who has alway been a proud employee of this network, I am offended,\" Colbert said. \"And I don't know if anything will ever repair my trust in this company.

And some of the TV typers out there are blogging that once Skydance gets CBS, the new owner's desire to please Trump could 'put pressure on late-night host and frequent Trump critic Stephen Colbert.'\"Given the timing of this monologue and Colbert's subsequent firing, it's hard not to take the cancelation of The Late Show as a sign of CBS caving to that pressure.

Good riddance","text":"It has been painfully obvious, ever since the presidential election last November, that the Democratic Party’s brand is in tatters. This week, a Quinnipiac University poll revealed that congressional Democrats have a minuscule 19% approval rating — an all-time low in the history of that particular poll. Earlier in the week, a Harvard CAPS/Harris poll similarly found that the party as a whole has an approval rating of 40% — considerably lower than the Republican Party’s 48% approval rating found by the same poll. Nor can Democrats necessarily rely on any GOP infighting to redound, in seesaw-like fashion, to their own benefit; for all the sturm und drang generated by the “Epstein files” affair, President Trump’s approval ratings have actually increased among Republicans this month. The issue for Democrats is that their current unpopularity is not a byproduct of the political scandals of the day or the vicissitudes of Trump’s polarizing social media feeds. Rather, the problem for Democrats is structural — and it requires a rethink and a reboot from soup to nuts. As this column argued last November, it is clear that Barack Obama’s winning 2008 political coalition — comprising racial and ethnic minorities, young people and highly educated white voters — has completely withered. “Obamaism” is dead — and Democrats have to reconcile themselves to that demise. At minimum, they should stop taking advice from Obama himself; the 44th president was Kamala Harris’ top 2024 campaign trail surrogate, and we saw how that worked out. In order for the party to rise up anew, as has often happened throughout American history following a period of dominance from a partisan rival, Democrats are going to have to move beyond their intersectional obsessions and woke grievances that have so greatly alienated large swaths of the American people on issues pertaining to race, gender, immigration, and crime and public safety. And the good news, for conservative Americans who candidly wish the Democratic Party nothing but the worst, is that Democrats seem completely incapable of doing this. Zohran Mamdani, the 33-year-old recent winner of New York City’s much-discussed Democratic mayoral primary, is a case in point. The Ugandan-born Shiite Muslim Mamdani is a democratic socialist, but he is better understood as a full-fledged communist. That isn’t hyperbole: One merely needs to consider his proposed policies for New York City and review his broader history of extreme far-left political rhetoric. Mamdani won the primary, and is now seeking the mayor’s office, on a genuinely radical platform: support for citywide “free” bus rides, city-owned grocery stores, a full rent freeze on certain low-income units, outright seizure of private property from arbitrarily “bad” landlords, race-based taxation (an assuredly unconstitutional proposal), a $30 minimum wage and more. A true Marxist, Mamdani has said “abolition of private property” would be an improvement over existing inequality. And he has something of a penchant for quoting Marx’s “Communist Manifesto” too. But Mamdani’s communism is only part of his overall political persona. He also emphasizes, and trades in, exactly the sort of woke culture warring and intersectional identity politics that have defined the post-Obama Democratic Party. Mamdani is a long-standing harsh critic of Israel who had declined to distance himself from the antisemitic rallying cry “globalize the intifada.” Most recently, he also opposed Trump’s decision to have the U.S. intervene in last month’s Israel-Iran war, condemning it as a “new, dark chapter” that could “plunge the world deeper into chaos.” (In the real world, there were zero American casualties, and the bombing run was followed promptly by a ceasefire.) There is, to be sure, nothing good down this road for denizens of New York City. If Mamdani wins this fall, expect a massive exodus of people, businesses and capital from the Big Apple — probably to the Sun Belt. But even more relevant: There is nothing good down that road for the national Democratic Party, as a whole. In order to demonstrate that the party has learned anything from its 2024 shellacking and its current abysmal standing, it will have to sound and act less crazy on the tangible issues that affect Americans’ day-to-day lives. That isn’t happening. If Mamdani’s rise is representative — and it may well be, especially as other far-left firebrands like Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-Texas) continue to make outsize noise — then Democrats seem to be moving in the exact opposite direction: full-on Marxism and woke craziness. If the party continues down this path, it will experience nothing but mid- to long-term political pain. But as one of the aforementioned conservatives who wishes the Democratic Party nothing but the worst, I’m not too upset about that.

Many have questioned the timing of the announcement given that Colbert recently criticized CBS' corporate parent, Paramount Global, for settling a suit filed by President Donald Trump that some legal observers think should have been dismissed on First Amendment grounds.\n\n But Colbert, 61, insists he is not backing down on his criticism of the sitting President.\n\n During Thursday night's episode, the host roasted Trump for several recent announcements, quipping that clearly the former host of The Apprentice would \"rather have us talk about his hand than Jeffrey Epstein.\"\n\n Trump has drawn ire from across the political aisle for reversing his campaign position on exposing the client list of the disgraced financier and convicted sex offender, whose 2019 death in jail was ruled a suicide.\n\n \"That controversy is causing so much trouble for Trump that he recently ordered it to be put in a cell and for the cameras to stop working for three minutes,\" Colbert said during his monologue, referencing reports that the prison video showing Epstein's cell the night of his death was tampered with.\n\n Colbert continued, \"Here's where things stand: MAGA is furious because they think Trump is refusing to release the Epstein files. In response, Trump has been saying that there are no credible files. And if there are, they're really boring. And also, Obama made them up.\"\n\n The Emmy winner accused Trump of \"desperately looking for a scapegoat,\" which Colbert joked would explain why he fired Maurene Comey, the Manhattan federal prosecutor who worked on the cases against Epstein as well as his accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell and hip-hop mogul Sean \"Diddy\" Combs.\n\n \"[Trump] pulled the UNO reverse card, calling on the FBI to investigate this Jeffrey Epstein hoax, by which he evidently means he wants the FBI to investigate the folks who investigated Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking, which is weird,\" Colbert said.\n\n Colbert also addressed Trump saying he wanted to fire Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell, whom he appointed in 2017, despite his claim that former Preside Joe Biden appointed Powell into office.\n\n \"Even the whiff of it roiled the stock market yesterday,\" Colbert said. \"That's because firing the Fed chair, who was supposed to be an independent steward of our financial system and our monetary policy, would create an issue that economists call [explosion noises]. One economist likened the idea of firing Powell to ripping the fabric of the universe.\"\n\n But, as Colbert added, \"Wall Street's message of abject panic must have gotten through to Trump because just a few hours after floating the idea, he told reporters that he was highly unlikely to fire the Fed chair, but made it clear he's no fan.\"\n\n The announcement of The Late Show's cancellation, which will end the franchise after it has aired for 33 years, provoked backlash from famous faces and fans alike.\n\n Sen. Elizabeth Warren — who has been candid about her disapproval over Paramount settling the lawsuit brought by Trump over a 2024 60 Minutes interview with his contender in that year's presidential election, Kamala Harris — is among the move's most vocal detractors.\n\n \"CBS canceled Colbert's show just THREE DAYS after Colbert called out CBS parent company Paramount for its $16M settlement with Trump — a deal that looks like bribery,\" the Massachusetts senator wrote on X on Thursday. \"America deserves to know if his show was canceled for political reasons. Watch and share his message.\"\n\n Though CBS labeled Trump's suit \"completely without merit\" and asked a judge to dismiss it, the network eventually conceded, a decision that many decried in light of Paramount's effort to merge with Skydance Media, which would require the approval of the Trump administration.\n\n Pushing further speculation about why The Late Show has been axed is Trump's reaction to the news.\n\n \"I absolutely love that Colbert got fired.

Their conspicuous silence includes the period from Jan. 20, 2021, to Jan. 20, 2025. Merrick Garland was the Attorney General appointed by Biden and ran the Department of Justice. They had access to everything related to Epstein. The crimes were just as abhorrent and sickening then as they are now.\n\nYet it appears that, up until recently, the overwhelming majority of Democrats showed little, if any, interest in the Epstein files. That is, until the Trump administration walked back a campaign promise and created a public relations nightmare with such an unforced error. Only then did Democrats become interested.\n\nConsider the comments by Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA), a member of the House Judiciary Committee, while being interviewed on CNN on Wednesday.\n\n“If you see such a need to investigate this, why didn’t you raise it during the Biden administration?” CNN’s Pamela Brown asked. “We couldn’t find that you made any public comments about Epstein in previous administrations.”\n\nShe couldn’t find them because they didn’t exist. Brown knows it. Jayapal knows it. We all know it. Nevertheless, she answered.\n\n“Well, I would have been happy to raise it then as well,” Jayapal replied.\n\nSure, congresswoman. Sure.\n\nJayapal then offered a Kamala Harris-esque word salad response, claiming she has consistently sought to hold all presidential administrations accountable for their sins. She mentioned several instances of allegedly doing so, but none of them had anything to do with Epstein. It was an attempted deflection, but, to her credit, Brown didn’t buy it.\n\n“So then why didn’t you call for more transparency earlier, during the Biden administration?” Brown asked. “I’m just trying to better understand why you’re so intent on calling for this.”\n\nJayapal rambled on again but did not provide anything substantive. And we all know why. It is because until Democrats were able to weaponize the Epstein case against President Donald Trump, they didn’t care — or feared the files could damage their own or their political goals and agendas.\n\n​​WHAT THE GOVERNMENT STILL WON’T REVEAL ABOUT JEFFREY EPSTEIN\n\nIt’s shameful and speaks volumes about their vulture-like tendencies. Once again, Democrats seek to exploit the tragedies of innocent people, in this case, sexually trafficked minors, solely for political gain. Jayapal is just one of many Democrats who are playing the American public. No one should believe anything she says or what Democrats are saying now regarding the Epstein files.\n\nThey’re liars, nothing more.
