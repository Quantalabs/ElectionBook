In a video message filled with explicit language, Berkwitt voiced his anger over Trump's presence at the cemetery.\"As a veteran who gave 20 years and 28 days of his life, I AM BEYOND PISSED!\" Berkwitt wrote on X. \"Who in the f****** hell allowed Trump to lay a wreath today at Arlington Cemetery that is shitting on my brothers and sisters who served their country, something this rotten bastard never did?\"In his video message, Berkwitt elaborated on his frustration, stating, \"As a veteran, who served for 20 years 28 days, during Desert Shield, Desert Storm, the Gulf War, In the Iraq War and retired honorably. I have upheld my oath every day since September 30, 2006, my retirement day. But on this day, a f****** treasonous traitor who tried to overthrow the government on January 6th, 2021. A convicted felon, an adjudicated rapist, liable for fraud, degenerate misogynistic pig, lying grifter who pushes bibles. They're now pushing books about b******* and were allowed to go to Arlington National Cemetery on this special day. What the f***? And who in the f*** allowed this m*********** to do that s*** and defecate on our fallen soldiers that are buried there.\"Berkwitt continued his impassioned critique, saying, \"You f****** MAGA m************ veterans. They're okay with this treasonous traitor. As I said, you all f****** service means nothing because the oath that I took and the f****** oath that you took you s****** on. But I wanna know who the f*** allowed this m*********** to go today and later this week for a f******* photo op. At the expense of our fallen brothers and sisters. You're f****** right. I'm pissed off. This m************ has no f****** load. F*** every single m************ that walks this f****** planet that supports this rotten m************.\"Some veteran accounts on X also chimed in with criticism of Trump attending the ceremony at the historic cemetery.Berkwitt's outburst highlights the ongoing tensions surrounding Trump's legacy, particularly in light of the events of January 6, 2021, and subsequent legal challenges. The former president was ordered to pay columnist E. Jean Carroll $83.3 million in January for comments he made after she first publicly accused him of raping her in the dressing room of a luxury department store in New York City. That came after a separate jury in May last year awarded Carroll $5 million after finding Trump liable for sexual assault and defamation.Newsweek contacted Trump's campaign via email on Monday for comment.Trump's appearance at Arlington National Cemetery on Monday, marking the third anniversary of a terrorist attack during the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. The August 26, 2021, incident at Abbey Gate outside Kabul's Hamid Karzai International Airport resulted in the deaths of 13 American service members and approximately 170 Afghan civilians, according to the U.S. Department of Defense.The Trump campaign also used the occasion to criticize Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, linking her to what they termed the \"chaotic retreat from Afghanistan.\" In a statement, the campaign asserted, \"Kamala Harris failed our soldiers and their families. President Trump never will.\"Trump himself commented on the anniversary on Truth Social, saying, \"This is the third anniversary of the BOTCHED Afghanistan withdrawal, the most EMBARRASSING moment in the history of our Country. Gross Incompetence. Kamala's and Biden's incompetence left 13 dead warriors, hundreds of civilians killed and grievously wounded.\"Vice President Harris and President Biden released statements about the anniversary and the fallen soldiers. Harris' statement praised the 13 service members who lost their lives as \"devoted patriots\" representing \"the best of America,\" while also defending Biden's decision to withdraw from Afghanistan.Trump's relationship with the military has been complex and often contentious. His past comments questioning the heroism of former Vietnam POW John McCain, suggestions that the Presidential Medal of Freedom surpasses the military Medal of Honor in prestige, and accusations of \"stolen valor\" against Tim Walz, who served 24 years in the Army National Guard, have drawn criticism from many in the veteran community.As the 2024 presidential race intensifies, the treatment and perception of veterans and military affairs are likely to remain central issues.","summary":"Retired Navy veteran Brad Berkwitt says Trump used the special occasion to \"defecate on our fallen soldiers buried there.\"","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-retired-veteran-reacts-arlington-national-cemetery-treason-traitor-1944681","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2458281/donald-trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-27 00:16:18","author":"Adeola Adeosun","authors":["Adeola Adeosun"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.039},{"id":254983806,"title":"Trump finds Virginia senate GOP candidate’s unusual name amusing: “He deserves to win just based on this!”","text":"Former President Donald Trump appeared amused by Virginia Senate candidate Hung Cao’s name during a campaign pit stop in the politician’s home state. ‘This is a great gentleman. I love his name: Hung Cao,’ Trump, 78, said at a Vietnamese restaurant in Virginia alongside the candidate, who moved to the state by way of West Africa as a refugee in the wake of the Vietnam War. ‘I love that name. And that name alone can get you elected,’ a visibly tickled Trump said during the event Monday, spurring patrons, and even 52-year-old Cao, to laugh. ‘It’s really an honor to be with you,’ Trump told those convened at Truong Tien Vietnamese Restaurant in Falls Church, with the republican newcomer poised to take on Democrat Tim Kaine stationed to his right. ‘Thank you.’ In a speech that also saw the ex-commander-in-chief juxtapose the supposed laziness of Joe Biden with the hardworking nature of Vietnamese-Americans, Trump mainly sang praises for Cao – eventually spurring a chant of ‘U-S-A.’ ‘I don’t know what it is. You’ll have to explain it. But the Vietnamese community loves me, and I love them,’ Trump told the crowd of supporters convened at the eatery at the town’s Eden Center Monday morning. Of Cao, he said, ‘We think he’s got a very good chance of winning for the Senate. And I really believe it. ‘I hope your community gets out and really supports him, like 100 percent,’ he said. ‘Because you can win. You can win. Definitely win. And we’re looking to win the state. And I think we will win the state.’ Cao, a retired Navy captain who came to the US in the 70s, proceeded to address the crowd in both Vietnamese and English. ‘I’m so honored to represent the Vietnamese-American community. Next year is the 50th anniversary of fall Saigon,’ he said of the the capture of the capital of South Vietnam by communist North Vietnam and the Viet Cong on April 30, 1975 ‘And we’ll have the first Vietnamese American U.S. senator on the anniversary,’ the Republican said. Trump, in turn, talked up the political newcomer, who since moving to the town of Purcellville has been an active member of their community and church. ‘More importantly [from his name], actually,’ Trump said of his Vietnamese American ally, ‘he’s tremendous. ‘He ran a great primary campaign. I endorsed him very early and he did very well. ‘We’re looking at polls that are showing us with a lead in this state, which is traditionally not necessarily for Republicans,’ Trump said at a point. ‘But I’m not the average Republican… and neither are you.’ Cao, the father of five children, is poised to take on Kaine come November, in a race where, as of writing, Kaine maintains a substantial lead. That said, as Trump indicated, the tides could shift, as Cao bills himself as a moderate conservative with Christian values, as well as a former vet who served in the US military. That stint came shortly after Cao’s arrival in the states following the fall of Saigon in 1975, when he made the move as a small child. At a point in the talk, Trump drew a contrast between the alleged laziness of Biden and the hard-working Vietnamese people, telling onlookers, ‘We are the closest to World War III we’ve ever been. And we have a man who just took a vacation in California and he came back today. Trump on Monday even took jabs at Joe Biden, saying ‘Where’s he going?’, a little over a month since he dropped out of the presidential race. ‘Delaware — another vacation, he’s going another week,’ he added, with Cao at his side. ‘That’s not the Vietnamese — they’re hard-working’ The former president proceeded to sign autographs and speak at length with patrons, with Cao at his side all the while. ‘Make America Great Again!’ one restaurant goer shouted in a thick Vietnamese accident, drawing a smile and laugh from the former president. Trump, meanwhile, is set to face off with Vice President Kamala Harris in November.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nFormer President Donald Trump appeared amused by Virginia Senate candidate Hung Cao&#8217;s&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump finds Virginia senate GOP candidate&#8217;s unusual name amusing: &#8220;He deserves to win just based on this!&#8221; first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/trump-finds-virginia-senate-gop-candidates-unusual-name-amusing-he-deserves-to-win-just-based-on-this/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rewrite-this-title-Trump-is-tickled-by-Virginia-senate-GOP.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-27 00:11:56","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.276},{"id":254983674,"title":"JD Vance Criticizes Joe Biden and Kamala Harris for ‘Betraying’ 13 Service Members Killed in Afghanistan Withdrawal","text":"Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance (OH) ripped President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris for their “betrayal” of the 13 U.S. service members who were killed during the disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal in 2021. Vance joined Gold Star Family members of several of the fallen service members — Marine Corps Sgt. Nicole L. Gee, Marine Corps Cpl. Hunter Lopez, and Marine Corps Lance Cpl. Jared M. Schmitz — on a press call Monday, which marked the third anniversary of the Abbey Gate bombing that took their lives. “What an incredible natural resource that we have in this country — young patriotic people who are willing to give their lives — and what an incredible betrayal that Kamala Harris and Joe Biden squandered that resource,” Vance said on the call that – News and other media attended. Vance emphasized that many of these families are particularly troubled by the lack of accountability within the Biden-Harris administration: What I hear from so many of the people speaking before me, talking about the loss of their sons and daughters and family members, is they’re not even mad that mistakes were made. Sometimes mistakes do happen, especially in a combat zone. What they’re angry about is the lack of accountability. “They’re angry that we don’t know why we made the decisions that led to these young troops dying unnecessarily. They’re mad that we don’t have any accountability,” he added. “Why has nobody been fired? Why has nobody suffered any consequences for doing what happened and, again, squandering our most precious resource in this country, the lives of the people who are willing to give it all for public service?” “The fact that we don’t know, the fact that the Harris administration has stonewalled at every step of the way, the fact that no one has been fired suggests that we have a real crisis of leadership in this country,” Vance said. Vance added that the 2024 presidential election presents a chance “to return to the kind of normalcy” where, when mistakes are made, “we will have enough respect for the American people and for the people who put on the uniform to understand those mistakes so that we can better prevent them in the future, and that’s what is most broken here.” Many of the Gold Star Family members who spoke on the call zoned in on a lack of accountability from the administration in the aftermath of their loved ones’ deaths in Afghanistan on August 26, 2021. “I’m so glad and so grateful that these families were willing to talk about that because I think it drives home how much of a dishonesty lies at the heart of Kamala Harris’s political pitch when she says that she wants to return to normal,” Vance said. “She wants to ‘return decency to the Oval Office.’ She wants to ‘return common sense to the Oval Office.’ There is no decency and there is no common sense in letting 13 Americans die unnecessarily and not understanding why it happened and not forcing those who caused it to suffer some consequences.” Vance continued: What an unbelievable country that we have, where you have these 13 beautiful young people who are willing to give their lives for it, and what an unbelievable slap in the face it is to our country that we don’t have a leadership that’s actually equal to the young people who put on the uniform every single day. So, I aim to be the kind of vice president that honors the sacrifice of the people who wear the uniform, and I know that, when President [Donald] Trump is back in the Oval Office, we are going to get to the bottom of this, and the people who screwed this up are going to suffer some consequences. He sees this as the “very least” of what each of the families deserves.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nRepublican vice presidential nominee Sen.

'I feel blessed that I was able to spend the last week with my mom before she passed. I appreciate everyone’s love and support and respect for my privacy during this impossible time.' Mariah's fans and followers sent the star plenty of love, with one writing, 'we love you & will continue to keep you & your entire family in our plans.'

Sending you love and light during this difficult time. Rest in Peace, Patricia Carey and Alison Ann Carey,' another fan added. 'Sad to hear, my condolences to your family Mariah Carey.' The comments continued, with another fan writing, 'I can't imagine the pain you're feeling at this time of mourning, may god comfort your heart and that of your family, we're here for you, we'll never leave you!!! we love you!!!' A fan page wrote, 'You are stronger than you think, we are here to send you strength in this difficult time. All the lambs feel for the loss of Patricia and Alison, may they both rest in the home of the Lord.' Another worried fan added, 'I’m praying that comfort can find you soon…my heart aches for you.' 'WOW!! Mariah Carey’s Mum and sister passed on the same day! This is too much!! Sending my love and condolences to Mariah and her family.' Mariah had a famously fraught relationship with her mother and sister over the years - and was estranged from Alison, a recovering drug addict, for three decades before her death. Patricia was married to Mariah's father, Alfred Roy Carey, until she was aged three. Mariah's father died at age 72 in 2002. As well as substance abuse, Alison endured homelessness throughout her life. She was also HIV positive. In 2016 Alison made an impassioned plea to her famous sibling with DailyMail.com, begging her to mend the rift between them and help save her life, saying: 'Mariah I love you, I desperately need your help.' She was in dire need of financial support as she battled back to health following a devastating home invasion attack that left her brain damaged and seriously ill. She had been in and out of the hospital. Mariah's fans and followers sent the star plenty of love following the sad news 'So sorry for your loss,' one fan page of the star wrote, sharing photos of the singer with her sister and mom 'Our hearts go out to Mariah and her family during this incredibly difficult time' 'Rest in peace,' another fan wrote, sharing photos of Patricia and Alison with Mariah A fan page wrote, 'You are stronger than you think, we are here to send you strength in this difficult time.

Sending my love and condolences to Mariah and her family' 'Sad to hear, my condolences to your family Mariah Carey' Another worried fan added, 'I’m praying that comfort can find you soon…my heart aches for you.' 'Sending you and your family prayers, we will see them again, One Sweet Day. We love you,' yet another fan wrote The comments continued, with another fan writing, 'I can't imagine the pain you're feeling at this time of mourning, may god comfort your heart and that of your family, we're here for you, we'll never leave you!!! we love you!!!' 'To lose one family member is hard enough, but to lose two within the same day is a whole other level of pain & sadness' Another simply comforted the star with the words 'I love you' In addition to Mariah and Alison, Patricia and Roy also had son Morgan, now 64. Julliard-educated Patricia was an opera singer and vocal coach. Mariah opened up about complicated relationships with her mom and sister in her 2020 memoir, The Meaning Of Mariah Carey. 'Like many aspects of my life, my journey with my mother has been full of contradictions and competing realities. It's never been only black-and-white — it's been a whole rainbow of emotions,' she explained. She said their relationship was a 'prickly rope of pride, pain, shame, gratitude, jealousy, admiration, and disappointment'. The book was still dedicated to Patricia: 'And to Pat, my mother, who, through it all, I do believe actually did the best she could,' the singer penned in the dedication. 'I will love you the best I can, always.' In 2020 Mariah alleged Alison who she described as 'troubled and traumatized ... tried to sell [her] out to a pimp.' In a passage in her book Carey said of her sister Allison: 'When I was 12 years old, my sister drugged me with valium, offered me a pinky nail full of cocaine, inflicted me with third degree burns and tried to sell me out to a pimp.' Winfrey, on The Oprah Conversation, asked the singer about why she feels her siblings who she described as 'extremely violent' - treated her as such to which the singer insisted they were 'damaged'. Mariah said of the trio: 'We don't even really know each other, and that's the thing. We didn't grow up together, but we did.' 'Like, they were on their journeys, by the time I got into the world, they had already been damaged, in my opinion. But again, I wasn't there. I was dropped into this world and I literally felt like an outsider amongst my own family.' 'My heart is broken that I’ve lost my mother this past weekend. Sadly, in a tragic turn of events, my sister lost her life on the same day,' the singer told People on Monday; seen with her mom Mariah had a famously fraught relationship with her mother and sister over the years; (L) seen with her mom, (R) seen with her sister at the singer's 1993 wedding to Tommy Mottola The Grammy-winning singer wrote that both siblings have been 'attacking' her verbally for years, amid their very public feud. She told Oprah: '[My siblings] just grew up with the experience of living with a Black father and a white mother together, as a family, and I was, for the most part, living with my mother, which they saw as easier, but in reality it was not.' She added that her siblings 'have always thought that [her] life was easy' and 'also always looked for ... a get rich quick scheme.' Mariah also famously claimed her mother called the police on her before her hospitalization in 2001. The singer was hospitalized in July of 2001 as her reps said she was dealing with 'extreme exhaustion.' The Grammy-winning singer told Oprah that her mother Patricia contacted the authorities amid a family fight. She said she was going through an 'emotional crisis' amid her promotional tour for her film Glitter, and was staying with her mother at the time. 'There was a code switching that happened and a power shift that was immediate,' the Hero singer said. 'It was immediate and she was in charge and instead of saying, 'I'm taking care of my daughter, she's tired, somebody called the cops by mistake,' or whatever, it was like, 'Oh no, because you defied me, this is what's going to happen.'' The I Don't Wanna Cry singer said she felt a strange sense of relief when police arrived and she got into their vehicle. 'In the backseat of the police car, it's a vivid memory I'll never forget,' she said. 'I have never spoken about it, but at that moment, that seemed like a better alternative than where I was.' Carey told Oprah that she didn't feel like she was in a 'breakdown mode' at the time, but rather overworked with her project Glitter, which was considered a critical and commercial failing amid Carey's vaunted career. 'If they had given me even two days,' she said, 'I would have gotten up, gone to the video shoot and made the video... as we've seen in this entertainment industry, it happens. In 2020 Carey alleged her sister Allison (pictured) who she described as 'troubled and traumatized... tried to sell [her] out to a pimp' In 2021 Alison sued Mariah for $1.25million, claiming her 2020 tell-all memoir The Meaning Of Mariah Carey caused 'immense emotional distress' 'People push artists to the edge and then they wonder why people are gone too soon.' Mariah and Alison's brother Morgan told Daily Mail Online from his home in Italy in 2016, that following the attack in April, Alison spent a short time at a mental hospital in New York after a bizarre episode in the street near her home. 'Because Mariah has not found it in her heart to help Alison get the care she requires there are times when Alison forgets or is unable to take her medication and this sometimes precipitates problematic behavior.' He said: 'Alison was institutionalized for observation after being found wandering in the street barefoot and partially dressed, causing the police to be concerned. 'Her behavior was caused as a result of damage done in the attack and her having missed the medications she was taking.' Morgan says that due to the severe brain damage, Alison suffers from memory loss, seizures, and occasional periods loss of consciousness. 'Alison's brain scans show severe damage,' he explains. Alison was released from the mental health facility after a few weeks. Morgan added: 'The worst is yet to come and Mariah has it in her power to at least ensure a soft landing and avoid a life time of regret about missing this opportunity to forgive and help her only sister.' 'I would be hopeful, although I am not encouraged by the past, that Mariah would step up because she's in a position to step up. 'We're talking about small change to these people, her fiancé is a billionaire. 'The least they could do is put Alison in a good hospital and make sure she gets the care she needs. 'Mariah is the one person in the family who could actually make a real meaningful difference to Alison's life.' Morgan says he flew from Maui last August to be at his sister's bedside when she took a turn for the worse, but Alison's mother and sister didn't show. It was then that he took a video of her in the hospital. 'It was painful for her to speak, you could hear the raspiness in her breath, she had had a tube down her throat for so long. 'She looked like she had been beaten down by this whole experience, her eyes were foggy, her skin jaundice and she had very little motor control. In 2016 Mariah's brother Morgan (C) said he hasn't spoke to his sister 'properly' for two decades 'Every effort, every movement was very labored and painful and difficult – but she was very much alive. 'I wanted to be able to prove that she was lucid, that she understood who she was, where she was, what was going on around her. 'I wanted people to see that she was a human being and that someone else shouldn't have the decision to decide whether she live or die.' Despite coming close to death Alison pulled through and made a miraculous recovery. Morgan was successful in having the 'do not resuscitate order' dropped and claims he is now his sister's medical proxy. In a third video taken on September 23, 2015 and viewed by Daily Mail Online, Alison is lucid as she is interviewed by a member of the staff of a New York hospital. She clearing states her name, date of birth and names Morgan Carey as her health care proxy. She also confirms that she wants the DNR be removed from her file. Alison recently left hospital and is being cared for by a Patient Advocate and staying at the advocate's home in New York. Morgan said: 'She is alive and is out of hospital, which is very positive. 'But she is being scheduled for surgery on her spine and she has faces more surgery on her brain, which is going to be tough. 'She's also going to drug addiction meetings and visiting with her sponsor which is good. Morgan said in the past 12 months, following the alleged attack by a home invader at her New York home in April last year, Alison had several brain surgeries, an operation on her spleen, a hip replacement and periods of physical rehabilitation. 'She was a train wreck,' Morgan recalls. 'And right now she's on several different medications to keep her seizures under control, she's fallen down several times and had bad injuries to her head because of her seizures. 'She also taking her HIV meds and anti-inflammatory meds and whatever else she's on. So yes she's on the mend, but still needs a lot of help.' The biggest problem, Morgan says, is the mounting medical bills. He says he'd love to be able to pay them but he can't afford to cover them all. 'It's been a constant battle, the insurance would run out, the Medicare would run out, we are always fighting that fight to just get these bills paid by Medicare,' he said. Alison has four children but while they have tried to help Morgan says they have always had a difficult relationship with their mother due to her drug addiction and prostitution past. Alison revealed she worked as a prostitute in New York as a young woman to clothe and feed her family before Mariah found fame. He said: 'It has to be real hard growing up knowing your mother is an addict and a prostitute, I can't even imagine putting myself in their shoes. 'But Alison did the best she could for her kids, was her best great, no, but she did the best she could.' Morgan says Alison inherited $1.6million from her father Alfred Carey, when he died in 2002, and she set up trust funds for her children. The rest of the money she has squandered on her drug addiction. He says he understands that Mariah - who hasn't spoken to her sister properly since they had a huge argument in 1994 - may not want to hand money to a drug addict through fear it will simply enable her. But he adds: 'Look me personally I'm not going to hand my sister Alison a penny directly, but if I can give money to the person giving her care, I'm going to do it. 'Is there a way of setting up a medical fund? You don't put cash in an addict's hands but you can make sure that their basic medical care is met, it's that simple. 'Mariah can easily manage this and still keep her distance. 'If she wants to hold her grudge, then let her hold her grudge.' He added: 'We just want to make Alison as comfortable as possible and to enjoy some kind of quality of life, I'm trying to do my best to help her.' In 2021 Alison sued Mariah for $1.25million, claiming her 2020 tell-all memoir The Meaning Of Mariah Carey caused 'immense emotional distress.' Alison said that Mariah lied about her older sibling drugging her and her older brother Morgan abusing her as a child in the book. The elder Ms. Carey - who described herself as 'profoundly damaged' - said that the Butterfly singer fabricated the stories 'to promote sales of her book' and offered no 'evidence to substantiate' her claims, according to legal documents obtained by TMZ. Mariah recalls her troubled childhood in the chapter 'Dandelion Tea,' claiming Alison 'gave her Valium, tried to pimp her out and threw a cup of boiling hot tea on her causing third-degree burns' at 12-years-old, according to Alison's Manhattan Supreme Court summons filed Monday. Alison, who is representing herself in the case, says the Honey songstress made the untrue claims despite knowing the damage it would cause her, given her personal trauma and health troubles. She cited trauma stemming from the alleged 'satanic' abuse she suffered at the hands of their mother Patricia, which are the subject of another suit Alison Carey filed against her mom last year, per Page Six. She also said Mariah was aware her sister was suffering from spine and digestive disorders and a traumatic brain injury, short term memory problems and vision problems after being attacked in 2015 in an 'unsolved home invasion.' Alison - who is HIV+ has been arrested for soliciting prostitution in the past - also said she was struggling with alcohol abuse after having been sober for 'a long time.' With this in mind, Alison says her famous sister maliciously 'used her status as a public figure to attack her penniless sister, generating sensational headlines describing lurid claims to promote sales of her book.' The elder Ms. Carey is asking for restitution for 'intentional infliction of immense emotional distress caused by defendant's heartless, vicious, vindictive, despicable and totally unnecessary public humiliation of defendant's already profoundly damaged older sister.' She said she sent Mariah's legal team an offer to settle on January 8th but never heard back, according to the court docs. Morgan said he planned to sue during a November 2020 conversation with The Sun, calling his sister's recollections 'delusional.' In the book she also claims Morgan was hired to kill someone for $30,000, but never went through with the job. 'It’s heartbreaking to witness my little sister’s descent into this hatefully delusional revisionist rant because it is so reminiscent of her unhinged behavior during her first breakdown,' he said. 'The so-called \"memoir\" is laden with lies, distortions and gross revisionism from beginning to end, and I can prove it. Mariah's parents divorced when she was only three years old and the relationship with her father Alfred (pictured) was reduced to spending Sundays together. Alfred Roy Carey passed away from cancer in 2002 at the age of 72 'When I reveal the truth, the facts and supporting evidence, it will be a very harsh pill for she and her publishers to swallow and rest assured I will be filing a lawsuit.' Mariah was similarly chilly while talking about her relationship with her siblings during a profile with Vulture last August, saying: 'Here's the thing: They have been ruthlessly just heartless in terms of dealing with me as a human being for most of my life. I never would have spoken about my family at all had they not done it first.' 'I have forgiveness in my heart, and so I forgive them, but I am not trying to invite anybody to come hang out over here. I think they're very broken, and I feel sad for them.' Mariah says it 'took a lifetime' for her to be brave enough to write the book, which was 'incredibly hard' for her.

Liam teased the iconic Britpop band's reunion during his headline set at Reading Festival on Sunday, before he and his older sibling, 57, suggested an announcement could be made on Tuesday 8.00am after a cryptic and identical post was shared to their social media accounts. According to The Sun the plans are well and truly in motion, with the pair already having reunited for a 'top secret' photoshoot to promote the comeback shows . Telling the publication: 'They will announce four shows at Wembley Stadium today, along with a load more dates across the whole of the UK, including in Manchester which will be incredibly poignant for them'. 'Once the announcement is made and their fans are rushing out to buy the tickets, the hard work will start as they get ready to start performing together again. Oasis' rumoured reunion will reportledy see the once feuding Gallagher brothers perform four huge gigs at Wembley before touring the UK next summer (L-R Noel and Liam pictured 2008) According to reports the plans are well and truly in motion, with the pair already having reunited for a 'top secret' photoshoot to promote the comeback shows (Wembley Stadium pictured) 'It is something so many people never thought would happen. But now the brakes have been taken off -and it's going to be mad.' MailOnline have contacted Noel and Liam's reps for comment. During his headline slot at Reading Liam performed a number of Oasis hits from their debut album Definitely Maybe to celebrate its 30th anniversary. Introducing Half The World Away - a 1994 B-side that also featured as the theme tune to sitcom The Royle Family - he told revellers: 'I wanna dedicate this song to Noel f**king Gallagher.' Liam continued to keep fans guessing by dedicating his rendition of Cigarettes & Alcohol at the Reading Festival to people who hate Oasis. The track, written by his older brother, was the final single on their 1994 debut album Definitely Maybe. As he closed the set, Liam suggested an announcement could be made on Tuesday at 8:00am. A short clip of a sign in the style of Oasis logo was projected on a large screen above the stage and subsequently shared to Oasis, Noel and Liam's official Instagram and X accounts. The white rectangular box which a black block in the centre had the date \"27.08.24'' written in the middle where the band's name is usually seen. It then flickered and changed to read \"8am''. According to The Sun the plans are well and truly in motion, with the pair already having reunited for a 'top secret' photoshoot to promote the comeback shows (pictured 2001) During his headline slot at Reading Liam performed a number of Oasis hits from their debut album Definitely Maybe to celebrate its 30th anniversary before he and his older sibling suggested an announcement could be made on Tuesday 8.00am after a cryptic and identical post was shared to their social media accounts Oasis has been promised a payday of £50 million to reform and embark on a global tour, with Liam appearing to confirm the reunion. The eye-watering sum is said to have convinced warring brothers Noel, 57, and Liam to bury the hatchet 15 years after they last appeared on stage together. A music industry source previously said that the band's reported ten nights at Wembley Stadium next summer, surpassing the eight-gig record recently set by Taylor Swift, would be a 'tough ask' at this stage of the year with bookings at the iconic London venue already at a near maximum. Read More The late-night phone calls that ended 15-year Oasis feud: Liam Gallagher dedicates Reading headline track to 'greatest songwriter' Noel - then teases more news TOMORROW as £50million reunion tour looks like it's definitely (maybe) ON 'There will be a run of dates at Wembley if the Oasis tour goes ahead, but it's a bit late to confirm a run of 10 dates now,' said a music industry source. 'Instead the tour is likely to take in other big stadiums in London, and in Manchester. Heaton Park is another possibility up there, as is a repeat of Liam Gallagher's more recent gigs at Knebworth.' 10 gigs at Wembley in 2025 would break Taylor Swift's recent record at the venue. The Cruel Summer songstress, 34, played eight shows at the north London venue to delighted crowds in June and August - making her the first solo artist to play the stadium that many times. She told the screaming audience: 'You have made me the first solo artist to play Wembley eight times on a single tour!' Their fractious relationship came to a head in 2009, after a backstage fight in Paris led to Noel leaving the band. In recent years, Liam has been keen to make amends with his brother and reform the iconic Britpop band, but his older brother poured cold water on the idea. Oasis has been promised a payday of £50 million to reform and embark on a global tour, with Liam appearing to confirm the reunion (pictured together 2008) The Cruel Summer songstress, 34, played eight shows at Wembley to delighted crowds in June and August But after Noel's £20m divorce from ex-wife Sara MacDonald last year, the elder Gallagher is said to have been persuaded of the financial merits of getting the band together for dates at Glastonbury and Wembley Stadium. It is expected to be the most popular tour in British concert history, with industry insiders saying the deal negotiated between the brothers will net them £50 million. It comes as Liam sent Oasis fans into frenzy, as he appeared to confirm the Don't Look Back In Anger singers would next year tour the country. Asked on X, formerly Twitter, about the planned Oasis shows, Liam wrote: 'See you down the front'. He later told his 3.6m followers on the platform: 'I never did like that word FORMER'. Despite the thawing in their relations, the younger Gallagher couldn't resist a dig at his brother. When asked what he would say to Noel when they return to the stage, he said: 'Keep up'.

Email tips@dailymail.com By Geraint Llewellyn For Mailonline Published:00:11 BST, 27 August 2024 |Updated:00:28 BST, 27 August 2024 e-mail View comments Freddie Brazier chocked back tears as he revealed having 'no memories' of late mum Jade Goody during the latest episode of Celebrity Race Across The Wold, which airs on Wednesday. TV personality Jade tragically died in 2009 aged 27 after being diagnosed with cervical cancer the year before. Freddie was just four when she died, while brother Bobby, now 21, was five. Joined by his father on the BBC challenge show, Freddie, 19, opened up about his grief in heartbreaking scenes before paying tribute to the Big Brother star on the anniversary of her death amid their travels in Salvador. He said: 'I lost my mum when I was four and that was on -Mother's Day, which is really hard. I don't really like showing my emotions. I don't even speak to my dad much about my mum either. I just avoid it. I prefer to bottle it up'. 'I don't want to feel like I'm a burden to them. A lot of my memories that I have of my mum have come from watching a documentary, YouTube clips, newspapers, they are not my memories'. Freddie Brazier chocked back tears as he revealed having 'no memories' of late mum Jade Goody during the latest episode of Celebrity Race Across The Wold, which airs on Wednesday Jade tragically died in 2009 aged 27 after being diagnosed with cervical cancer the year before. Freddie was just four when she died, while brother Bobby was five (pictured 2006) While choking back tears he continued: 'I don't really remember being held by my mum. If I had more memories of her, it would have made it a whole lot harder for me. 'But I think I would rather that than not really remember the things that I had done with my mum. It's just life really and I've kind of accepted that'. Father and son later agreed to pay tribute to Jade on Mother's Day and headed to a famous beauty spot, with Freddie saying as they searched for it: 'Maybe Mum's pushing us in the direction of where we need to go.' Before coming across it and adding: 'Thank you, Mother Nature.' Last week Jeff left viewers in tears as he opened up about helping his sons after Jade's death. In emotional scenes the father spoke candidly saying: 'I think when the boys lost their mum I really doubled down on putting all of my time, effort, attention, focus on my children,' Jeff said. 'I needed to be there, helping them to navigate whatever the future was going to look like for them given their loss. And I'm still playing that role. 'But yeah the more Fred does for himself, I know that he can start to push on in life.'

I don't really like showing my emotions. I don't even speak to my dad much about my mum either (pictured 2007) While choking back tears he continued: 'I don't really remember being held by my mum. If I had more memories of her, it would have made it a whole lot harder for me (pictured with brother Bobby and dad Jeff) In a later scene, Jeff and Freddy were enjoying a short break to take in the breathtaking views when he did some self-reflection. 'It's hard to switch off and sometimes I think I'm being too serious,' Jeff said. 'Just everything is my responsibility, and it has been for such a long time, because I think as a man you probably don't rate your chances of coping, so you do what comes naturally to you which is to take all the responsibility and just focus on the situation. 'I have absolutely 100 per cent lost the ability to play but I think that it's something that i need to regain. I think I need Freddie to show me really, and I need to get back to... I need to get back to what I used to be. I'm sure that's possible.' The father-son duo shared a sweet moment as Freddie convinced his dad to relax and leave the bags downstairs while they admired the view. Jeff went upstairs to find his son sitting down with a dog.

Republican Governor Brian Kemp asked Attorney General Christopher Carr for “guidance” on whether he can remove members of the state election board, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports. This comes after three right-wing members of the five-person board championed and passed a series of new rules that add extra requirements for county election boards to certify their results. Under the rules passed this month — less than 100 days before election day on November 5 — county boards must make a “reasonable inquiry” before certifying the election. However, the rules do not define what an inquiry should involve or what “reasonable” means, according to the Journal-Constitution. County election boards are also required to hold a meeting to verify their vote count on the Friday after election day, which is before the ballot return deadline for voters overseas and in the military. The three right-wing members - Janelle King, Rick Jeffares and Janice Johnston - were recently praised by Donald Trump for championing new rules. The former president called them “pit bulls fighting for honesty, transparency and victory.” Trump has beem charged in Fulton County, Georgia, alongside his former attorney Rudy Giuliani and others with election interference charges. Trump has claimed that he lost Georgia to President Joe Biden due to widespread election fraud - which there is no evidence of. Representative Lucy McBath, a Democrat, called the board’s new rules a “concerted effort to subvert democracy and move us backward.” “With passing this new rule, they are creating barriers to counting votes and certifying the elections so Donald Trump can once again attempt to throw our country into chaos,” she said. The Democratic Party has sued to challenge the rules, arguing that they could delay certification and lead to disputes over the vote. Kamala Harris’s campaign endorsed the lawsuit, according to the Journal-Constitution. “Certifying an election is not a choice, it’s the law,” Quentin Fulks, principal deputy campaign manager for the Harris campaign, said. “A few unelected extremists can’t just decide not to count your vote.” At least 19 election officials across Georgia have refused to verify various election results since 2020. King, one of the three right-wing board members who advocated for the new rules, dismissed criticisms against them. “I’m going to continue to do what’s right and let the Democrats play the political games,” King told the Atlanta newspaper. “There’s nothing we’re doing that will impact certification. If they have the proper information needed to certify, you won’t see them even attempt to delay certification.” Georgia Republican Party Chairman Josh McKoon also said the rule changes are “common sense rules that ensure election integrity,” according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. “In no way do these rule changes interfere with anyone’s right to vote or cause undue burdens on election workers, but these steps will ensure transparency, accountability, accurate reporting and reconciliation,” McKoon added. The Independent has contacted King, Jeffares and Johnston for comment.","summary":"Donald Trump recently praised the right-wing coalition on the Georgia state election board","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/georgia-election-trump-brian-kemp-b2602111.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/26/23/GettyImages-2158908857.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/ZWpfCk0H-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-26 23:28:47","author":"Katie Hawkinson","authors":["Katie Hawkinson"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.396},{"id":254982570,"title":"Donald Trump's Electricity Plan Is Popular With Democrats","text":"Nearly half of Democrats surveyed in one poll are in favor of expanding nuclear energy throughout America, an idea recently touted by former president Donald Trump.Nuclear energy's favorability has increased in recent years as more people recognize it as a clean energy source and alternative to fossil fuels, the use of which can exacerbate climate change. Trump spoke in favor of expanding nuclear energy across America, specifically in regard to how he sees nuclear power as an avenue to increase the nation's energy supply needed for artificial intelligence (AI), in a discussion with Shawn Ryan, a former Navy SEAL and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) contractor, that aired on Monday.\"For AI you will need...more electricity than we have right now,\" Trump said. \"You'll need double the energy that we produce right now just for that one industry if we're going to be the big player.\"\"President Trump has said he wants to utilize all forms of energy, while Comrade Kamala wants to demonize energy producers as she peddles her Green New Scam,\" Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung told Newsweek. Newsweek reached out to Harris' campaign by email for comment.However, current federal rules and regulations—many of which were passed decades ago to protect the environment but now slow infrastructure projects needed to meet the U.S. government's environmental goals from occurring at the needed pace—make it difficult to construct nuclear power plants on an efficient timeline.\"So we have to produce massive electricity that we don't have, but the environmental impact statements won't allow us to do that,\" Trump said. \"The rules and regulations that we currently have won't allow us to do any of it, not even a tiny fraction of it. But if I'm president, we'll be able to do it.\"Trump's plan to build more nuclear power plants is one that could prove agreeable among Democrats, according to a poll completed in May and updated in August by the Pew Research Center. The poll surveyed 8,638 randomly selected U.S. adults and found that 49 percent of Democrats said they were in favor of expanding nuclear energy sources across the U.S.Democrats are more likely to support clean energy like wind or solar, with 88 percent and 91 percent of poll-takers voicing their support for each source respectively, but neither energy source is completely innocent in its impact on the environment, particularly with regards to harming wildlife. Far more Democrats support nuclear energy than energy acquired from offshore oil or gas drilling, hydraulic fracturing or coal mining.\"Nuclear now has become very good, very safe,\" Trump said in the Ryan interview.It's also one of the cleanest forms of energy available, which helps bridge the gap between Democrats and Republicans, although the latter are more inclined to support the expansion of nuclear power plants. However, the Democrats voicing their support for expanding America's nuclear energy profile has increased by 12 points since 2020, Pew Research Center reported.","summary":"Donald Trump recently spoke in favor of expanding nuclear energy around the U.S., a plan supported by 49 percent of Democrats.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-nuclear-energy-popular-democrats-1944649","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2458239/donald-trumps-nuclear-energy-plan-popular-democrats.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-26 23:27:32","author":"Anna Skinner","authors":["Anna Skinner"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.131},{"id":254983172,"title":"Debating points: Trump, Harris trade shots over September showdown","text":"The campaigns of Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are arguing in advance of their high-stakes Sept. 10 debate over whether microphones should be muted except for the candidate whose turn it is to speak, and even whether the showdown will occur. While it’s common for campaigns to quibble beforehand over debate mechanics, both Harris and Trump are under pressure to deliver a strong performance next month in Philadelphia. The first debate during this campaign led to President Joe Biden’s departure from the race. Trump on Sunday night raised the possibility that he might not show up on ABC, posting on his Truth Social network that he had watched the network’s Sunday show with a “so-called Panel of Trump Haters” and posited, “why would I do the Debate against Kamala Harris on that network?” and urging followers to “Stay tuned!!” The current dispute centers on the muting of microphones when a candidate isn’t speaking, a condition both Biden and Trump accepted for their June debate hosted by CNN. Both sides are accusing the other of gaming the system to protect their candidate. Biden’s campaign team made microphone muting a condition of its decision to accept any debates this year, and some aides now regret the decision, saying voters were shielded from hearing Trump’s outbursts during the debate. That move likely would not have helped the incumbent Democrat’s disastrous performance. The Harris campaign now wants microphones to be live all the time, according to Harris spokesman Brian Fallon, who issued a statement needling Trump. “Trump’s handlers prefer the muted microphone because they don’t think their candidate can act presidential for 90 minutes on his own,” Fallon said. Harris “is ready to deal with Trump’s constant lies and interruptions in real time. Trump should stop hiding behind the mute button.” Trump spokesman Jason Miller retorted that the Republican nominee had “accepted the ABC debate under the exact same terms as the CNN debate.” He alleged Harris’ representatives sought “a seated debate, with notes, and opening statements.” Miller then took a shot at Harris not sitting for an interview or holding a news conference since Biden ended his reelection and endorsed her, arguing her campaign now wants “to give her a cheat sheet for the debate.” The Harris campaign denied Miller’s claim that she wanted notes or to be seated during the debate. “I’d rather have it probably on,” Trump said Monday during a stop in the Washington area, when asked if he wanted microphones muted. “I didn’t like it the last time, but it worked out fine,” he added, in terms of the policy during his debate with Biden. “We agreed to the same rules — same rules, same specifications,” Trump noted, for his Sept. 10 debate with Harris. “And I think that’s probably what it should be.” Asked how he was preparing for the debate, Trump responded, “I’m not. … I think my whole life I’ve been preparing for a debate.” Complicating the negotiations this year is that debates are being orchestrated on an ad hoc basis by host networks, as opposed to the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates, through which debate rules were negotiated privately. Microphones have been unmuted for both candidates for most of televised presidential debate history. The debate commission announced that its October 2020 debate would have microphones muted when candidates were not recognized to speak after the first Biden-Trump contest descended into a shouting match. The second 2020 debate with the microphone muting rules was widely celebrated for being more substantive than the earlier matchup.","summary":"Trump on Sunday night raised the possibility that he might not show up on ABC, posting on his Truth Social network that he had watched the network's Sunday show with a \"so-called Panel of Trump Haters\" and posited, \"why would I do the Debate against Kamala Harris on that network?\" and urging followers to \"Stay tuned!!\"","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2024/08/26/debating-points-trump-harris-trade-shots-over-september-showdown/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/AP24239697707455.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-26 23:27:20","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.404},{"id":254982394,"title":"Kamala Harris supports radical legislation to pack the Supreme Court, Democrat senator says ","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris has signaled her support for radical legislation that would allow a new Supreme Court justice to be appointed to the bench every two years, according to a Democratic senator. “They have not gone so far as to say, ‘We endorse your bill.’ They have said that your bills are precisely aligned with what we are talking about,” Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) told The Dispatch last week when asked if the Harris campaign has voiced its support for legislation he proposed last October that would dramatically overhaul the high court. Under Whitehouse’s bill, Supreme Court appointments would be “regularized,” with the president appointing a new justice biennially. Only the nine most recently appointed justices would sit for “appellate jurisdiction” cases, which are typically the most high-profile cases with far-reaching effects, such as Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization and former President Donald Trump’s immunity case. The newly-appointed jurists would spend 18 years participating in appellate jurisdiction cases, after which they would be limited to hearing the court’s small number of “original jurisdiction” cases, such as those involving disputes between states. President Biden and Harris announced their support for a revamped Supreme Court system last month in which a justice would be appointed every two years and spend 18 years in active service. The proposal, however, was light on details and did not mention whether the reforms would be sought through congressional legislation, a constitutional amendment or executive action. Whitehouse, at an event on the sidelines of the Democratic National Convention last week, further revealed that Democratic lawmakers are “virtually certain” to ram through a package of controversial legislative reforms – including the court-packing bill – if they win a controlling majority of the government in November. “To get around the filibuster, we’re going to have to have a process that allows very substantial debate from the Senate minority,” Whitehouse said at an event hosted by the Brennan Center for Justice, according to The Dispatch. “We are not going to want to give the Republicans multiple stalls, multiple filibusters on this.” “So the bill that gets around the filibuster will be virtually certain to include permanent reproductive rights, permanent restored voting rights, getting rid of corrupting billionaire dark money, and Supreme Court reform.” Whitehouse predicted that a bill of that magnitude would have “spectacular tailwinds behind it” in Congress. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer confirmed to reporters at the DNC that doing away with the upper chamber’s traditional three-fifths majority requirement to pass legislation is at the top of his agenda if Harris defeats former President Donald Trump and Democrats take control of both the House and the Senate. Schumer noted that he did not have majority support for ending the filibuster after the 2022 midterm election cycle because of opposition from independent Sens. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Joe Manchin of West Virginia – who are both leaving the Senate next year. The Harris campaign and Whitehouse’s office did not respond to The Post’s requests for comment.","summary":"Vice President Kamala Harris has signaled her support for radical legislation that would allow a new Supreme Court justice to be appointed to the bench every two years, according to a Democratic senator. ","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/26/us-news/kamala-harris-supports-radical-legislation-to-pack-the-supreme-court-democrat-senator-says/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/kamala-harris-supports-radical-legislation-88339864.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/Zl4oTJyr-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-26 23:19:26","author":"Victor Nava","authors":["Victor Nava"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.125},{"id":254982450,"title":"Donald Trump promises a new ‘Space National Guard’ if he retakes White House","text":"Donald Trump pledged on Monday to create a Space National Guard if he retakes the White House in November’s presidential election. The issue has been hotly debated by the Pentagon, congressional legislators, and state governors, turning it into what has been dubbed a “political lightning rod.” At a campaign stop in Detroit Monday, Trump told members of the National Guard Association that one of his “proudest achievements” in office was the creation of the Space Force. “It’s a big deal,” the Republican presidential nominee told the attendees. Trump, who is floundering as Democratic rival Vice President Kamala Harris surges in the polls, said the “time has come to create a Space National Guard as the primary combat reserve of the US Space Force.” He told the crowd that Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican who Trump denigrated during the 2016 primaries as “Little Marco,” was a big supporter of a Space National Guard, supposedly telling the 45th president: “I love this, I love it, I love it.” “So, we’re going to do that,” Trump went on. “Space Force has been very important. Very, very important. When I did that, the, the people came in, they wanted to end it, and they were just hammered, because people realized how important we were getting, just, destroyed in space.” The existing National Guard presently has space-centric units in seven states — Alaska, California, Colorado, Florida, Hawaii, New York, and Ohio — and Guam. The concept of a separate Space National Guard has been floating around since 2019, when Trump established the Space Force. National Guard leaders have come out in favor of such a plan. However, many experts have criticized any such initiative as one that would create unnecessary bureaucracy, complications, and costs. “Creating a Space National Guard would effectively tie the service’s hands in managing its personnel and create wasteful overhead and duplication that drain funding and leadership attention away from higher priorities,” American Enterprise Institute defense analyst Todd Harrison wrote in May. “Congress should keep the Space Force lean and agile and give it the authority it is requesting to manage its personnel as one unified component.” Last month, retiring National Guard Bureau boss Gen. Daniel Hokanson warned that transferring Air National Guard units into the Space Force could rob states of important resources and lead to unintended consequences if it were to come to pass.

President Biden “has not made any substantive remarks about the threat from the Houthis since January.” And one of his “first actions was to remove the Iranian-backed Houthis from the US list of global terrorist organizations.” If he’s staying in office ’til Jan. 20, “is it too much to ask that he comes out and talk about these sorts of things once in a while?” DNC beat: Dems’ Plan To Spread Poverty While lots of “celebrities, labor leaders and politicians” spoke at last week’s Democratic National Convention, notes The Wall Street Journal’s Allysia Finley, missing were “entrepreneurs who generate middle-class jobs.” Democrats “took turns whacking ‘oligarchs’ and ‘corporate monopolists,’”; by the time Harris took the stage, “the pinatas’ pickings had been splattered around.” This is “what Democrats plan to do if they win: destroy wealth creators so they can spread the booty among their own.” They call for “taxing success so government can hand out money” and grow itself. “As long as we look to legislation to cure poverty, or to abolish special privilege,” warned Henry Ford, we’ll see “poverty spread and special privilege grow.” That, sighs Finley, is “the joyous future Americans can expect during a Harris presidency.” Conservative: Dems Pushed RFK Jr. To Trump Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.’s endorsement of Donald Trump “sent shockwaves throughout the Democrat establishment,” writes the American Thinker’s Earick Ward. “This was surely not an easy decision for RFK,” but “he believed” there are issues “ that needed to be addressed . . . that mattered to the Democrat electorate,” and the Democratic Party “kicked him to the curb.” “It is reported that RFK reached out to the Kamala Harris campaign a couple weeks ago” and said “he’d be willing to drop out of the race, if he could be considered for a cabinet post,” and he “was rebuffed.” “What was he supposed to do?” Eye on the economy: A Looming Inflation-Hiker With inflation still a “top concern,” warns Diana Furchtgott-Roth at The Hill, “it appears more price hikes and supply-chain problems are coming.” With East Coast labor contracts expiring Sept. 30, “the International Longshoremen’s Association is threatening to strike.” The union wants a 32% pay hike and no more automation at ports. Per one expert, “a one-day strike would take five days to clear,” while “a two-week strike wouldn’t be cleared until 2025.” This could mean “driving up inflation and shutting down the nation’s economy.” Hmm: “Railroad and airline crews cannot simply decide to stop working”; that port workers can is something “Congress should take another look at.” — Compiled by The Post Editorial Board","summary":"Friendly advice that Donald Trump should focus on the economy or “concentrate more on the issues in this campaign” is “ insufficient to making the case against Kamala Harris,” argues Rich Lowry at The New York Times.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/26/opinion/trump-can-win-on-character-no-green-tears-over-spilled-oil-and-other-commentary/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/2024-detroit-michigan-michigans-importance-88338750-e1724711730767.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-26 23:04:14","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.282},{"id":254981968,"title":"Harris, Trump chase union workers in 2024 election battleground states","text":"Harris, Trump chase union workers in 2024 election battleground states Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are focusing their efforts in several battleground states to court union workers who may help sway the 2024 presidential election.

The lawsuit claims that the board intended to give local election officials a broad license to “hunt for purported election irregularities of any kind, potentially delaying certification and displacing longstanding (and court-supervised) processes for addressing fraud.” The lawsuit was filed in state court by local election officials, political candidates, the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Party of Georgia with support from Vice President Kamala Harris’s presidential campaign. The move comes weeks after the state election board voted 3-2 to pass rules to give election officials authority to conduct “reasonable inquiry” into elections before certification and to require that county election officials be given “all election related documentation” before certification. Both rules, the lawsuit argues, create the impression that local election officials have discretionary power over certifying election results. The political spotlight has pivoted back to Georgia in recent weeks, since President Biden withdrew from the presidential race and polls have shown Ms. Harris closing the gap with former President Donald J. Trump in the critical swing state. The increasingly close nature of the race there has thrust the actions of the state election board to center stage.","summary":"The board recently passed new rules aimed at altering the process for certifying elections.

But what if third-party and independent candidates played a spoiler role? Robert F. Kennedy Jr. mounted his own independent bid for the presidency this election cycle, as did celebrity scholar Cornel West. Both men fought battles to get on state ballots for the election, with mixed degrees of success — Arizona rejected West's efforts, while New York rebuffed several attempts by Kennedy. It's hard work: Kennedy finally dropped out of the race in late August and endorsed Donald Trump. There have been lots of attempts to disrupt the two-party system since Democrats and Republicans emerged as the main rivalry in the mid-19th century. None of them have lasted over the long term — or won a presidential election — but a few notable efforts have left their imprint on American politics and history.

Sign up American Independent Party The notorious segregationist George Wallace formed the American Independent Party in 1968 in order to run for president. (He had failed in his effort to win the Democratic Party nomination from President Lyndon Johnson four years earlier.) Curtis LeMay, the former Air Force general who urged President Kennedy to bomb Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis, was his running mate. Wallace didn't think he could win the presidency outright — but he did think he could game the system and play kingmaker. PBS' American Experience described the strategy in its history of the 1968 campaign: Although Wallace campaigned \"as though he believed he were a viable candidate for president,\" the real goal was to sap enough votes from Richard Nixon and Hubert Humphrey, the Republican and Democratic nominees, to deny both men an electoral college victory, and thus throw the election to the House of Representatives. \"There, Wallace could demand that the other candidates support him on his issues before he would deliver the presidency,\" said PBS. Here's the crazy thing: it nearly worked. Wallace carried five states — Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia — and came close to Nixon in North Carolina and Tennessee. Nixon barely beat Humphrey in the national popular vote, eking out a 1% win, but claimed 301 electoral votes, which were more than needed to spoil Wallace's dream of spoiling his election. Wallace's consolation: He was the last third-party candidate to win electoral votes. He tried again in 1972 but was shot and paralyzed on the campaign trail. Reform Party Like the American Independent Party, the Reform Party started out as a vehicle for one man's outsized presidential ambitions. Ross Perot, the billionaire Texas businessman, had made a splashy, on-again, off-again run for president as an independent candidate in 1992 — and performed respectably, capturing nearly 19% of the popular vote. (Bill Clinton won that election, and many Republicans have long blamed Perot for spoiling George H.W. Bush's re-election in that campaign.) In 1995, he decided to make it formal, announcing the launch of the Reform Party, and predicting it would eventually replace either the Democratic Party or GOP. \"One of those two parties is going to disappear,\" Perot told an interviewer, \"one of those special interest parties is going to melt down.\" Unsurprisingly, Perot was the Reform Party's first nominee for president in 1996. But he didn't do as well as his first run — he earned just 8.4% of the popular vote. (For what it's worth, that was just about the margin of Clinton's victory over GOP nominee Bob Dole.) That was good enough that, under federal law, the Federal Election Commission in 2000 provided $12.6 million in matching funds to the party's 2000 nominee, conservative commentator Pat Buchanan. But the Reform Party has never again made quite the impact it did during Perot's first runs for the presidency. Instead, its legacy might be best remembered for two things. In 1998, former professional wrestler Jesse \"The Body\" Ventura won the Minnesota governorship under the Reform Party banner — albeit with 37% of the vote. And in 2000, another celebrity businessman in the tradition of Ross Perot made a brief, aborted run for the party's presidential nomination. You might have heard of him: His name was Donald Trump. Green Party No discussion of modern third parties is complete, of course, without the Green Party. It originally formed in the 1980s with an emphasis on environmental justice, but it really came to prominence in 2000 when consumer crusader Ralph Nader won the party's nomination and made a bid for lefty voters who had become disenchanted with the Democratic Party's \"third way\" neoliberalism under Bill Clinton. Nader won just 2.74% of the vote. That might not be worth mentioning — except, of course, that was the year George W. Bush lost the popular vote and won the electoral vote, barely. The race between Bush and Al Gore came down to Florida, which ended up infamously mired in a weeks-long haze of hanging chads amidst a recount of the votes to see who would win the state's electoral votes, and thus the presidency. Officially, Bush won the state by 537 votes, after a controversial Supreme Court ruling that stopped the recount. Nader received more than 97,000 votes in the state. And Democrats have blamed him ever since for costing the party the White House. \"Lots of factors can be blamed for such a paper-thin defeat,\" Bill Scher said for Real Clear Politics. But if Nader had \"chosen not to embark on an obviously quixotic campaign, Al Gore would have been elected president.\" Nader has always denied culpability for Gore's loss. \"The two-party tyranny is spoiled to the core,\" Nader wrote in 2016 for the Los Angeles Times. \"The least-worst choices are getting worse every four years.\" Forward and No Labels The 2024 election brought several new groups into the fray. In 2022, former New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman and one-time presidential candidate Andrew Yang — who came to prominence as a Republican and Democrat, respectively — announced the formation of Forward, a centrist party designed to appeal to Americans frustrated with the country's two dominant political factions. \"Some call third parties 'spoilers,'\" the pair said in a Washington Post op-ed, \"but the system is already spoiled.\" There are skeptics. \"The Forward Party is making a dangerous miscalculation,\" Mary Anna Mancuso said for Politico. \"It is betting that what a party opposes is more important than what it stands for.\" The party didn't end up nominating a presidential candidate in 2024, but it is working on several state-level races. It is No Labels, though — a coalition of Republicans, Democrats and independents that was formed to fight partisanship — that has drawn the most attention and criticism. The group was seen by critics as a means of attracting centrist votes that might otherwise go to the Democratic ticket, and thus assisting Donald Trump's election efforts. In April, though, No Labels announced it would not nominate a presidential candidate. \"No Labels has always said we would only offer our ballot line to a ticket if we could identify candidates with a credible path to winning the White House,\" the group said in a statement. \"No such candidates emerged, so the responsible course of action is for us to stand down.\" Explore More Election In Depth 2024 Presidential Election World News Us News To continue reading this article...

Under any scenario,\" O'Leary said on Monday's \"Outnumbered.\" \"Every president, every president has been able to address the press. And in the good times and the bad times. She has to start talking to the press, period.\" O'Leary, one of the famous investors on Shark Tank and chairman of O'Leary Ventures, said investors like himself and swing state voters want answers from the Democratic presidential candidate, but she has thus far refused to lay out her policies in detail. ‘WHATEVER:’ DEMOCRATS REACT TO KAMALA HARRIS' LACK OF INTERVIEWS \"I need explanations for these policies because I have to invest on these policies,\" the businessman and chairman of O'Leary Ventures said. \"I have questions and I don't get any answers. I'm not being unreasonable.\" \"Come out, come out, wherever you are and talk to the press!\" he demanded. Harris has gone over five weeks without giving specifics to voters about her policy positions, holding formal news conferences or sitting for major interviews since becoming the Democrats' presidential nominee. Despite ignoring the press, the vice president's campaign has benefited from positive media coverage since President Biden dropped out of the 2024 race. One study from a conservative organization found that Harris had received 84% positive coverage on ABC, CBS, and NBC's evening newscasts since announcing her presidential bid. \"Outnumbered\" co-host Emily Compagno said that the media had \"absolutely operated\" as a surrogacy for the Biden-Harris administration and now the Harris campaign. HOW LONG WILL THE KAMALA HARRIS HONEYMOON IN THE POLLS AGAINST DONALD TRUMP LAST? The panel discussed a heated interview between ABC anchor Jonathan Karl and Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., on Sunday as an example of the press working on Harris' behalf. Karl vigorously defended Harris after Cotton brought up her past commitment to abolish private health insurance as part of her presidential campaign in 2019. \"That's not her position now,\" Karl said in the back-and-forth with Cotton, insisting that Harris had moved to the middle on this policy. \"Is Jonathan Karl a Kamala Harris campaign surrogate?\" co-host Kayleigh McEnany reacted to the clip on \"Outnumbered.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Compagno gave other examples to argue that the press's coverage had benefited Harris. \"The whole point is that the media has absolutely operated as a surrogacy for Kamala Harris this entire time or the Biden-Harris administration. And now that apparently goes to policies,\" she said. Former President Trump also slammed the ABC interview as an example of media bias toward his campaign. \"When I watched this interview of Tom Cotton… and the round table after that, I said, the hostility is crazy,\" Trump told reporters on Monday. The GOP candidate said he was \"thinking about\" skipping the September 10 debate after his campaign said the Harris campaign was trying to change the previously agreed upon debate rules.

Most of those that attracted national attention were at the Democratic National Convention, culminating in Vice President Kamala Harris’s big moment on Thursday. But there was another important speech on Friday: Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s talk at the Fed’s annual shindig in Jackson Hole, Wyo. Yes, Powell’s remarks were of particular interest to investors looking for clues about future monetary policy. But even though his speech was rigorously apolitical, it had important political implications. For what we’re seeing, I’d argue, is inflation fading away — not just in the data, but also as a political issue. And that, of course, is very good news for Democrats. About Powell’s speech: He noted that the inflation rate has declined a lot since it peaked in 2022 and expressed confidence that it’s on track to reach the Fed’s target of 2 percent — and why it’s getting there without the mass unemployment some economists had claimed would be necessary. Falling inflation all but guarantees that the Fed will cut interest rates at its Open Market committee meeting next month, although the size of the anticipated cut is uncertain. What has brought inflation down? Like many economists, myself included, Powell believes that inflation was largely caused by “pandemic-related distortions” and that “the unwinding of these factors took much longer than expected but ultimately played a large role in the subsequent disinflation.”","summary":"The cost of living may not be the G.O.P.’s, um, trump card.","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/26/opinion/inflation-trump-harris-powell.html","image":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/27/multimedia/26krugman-pctw/26krugman-pctw-facebookJumbo.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-26 23:00:06","author":"Paul Krugman","authors":["Paul Krugman"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.136},{"id":254981490,"title":"Congress must force intel agencies to come clean about Iran’s US-protest funding","text":"With students returning to college, and Hamas-backers already resorting to campus mischief, it’s time to shine a spotlight on Iran’s protest-financing. Maybe it’ll finally show these antisemitic goons — or at least pols like President Biden and Veep Kamala Harris — what “useful idiots” they’ve been. National intel boss Avril Haines confirmed last month that Tehran is behind some funding of anti-Israel, anti-American protesters in the United States. As Danielle Pletka & Stephen Ailinger note at National Review, Haines’ revelation was a “warning about Iran’s ability to manipulate American civil society and underscores the imperative to declassify intelligence about Iran’s influence operations” in America. Focusing public attention on those operations can help dispel claims, such as by Team Biden, that the protests are “organic.” They can also prove how wrong Biden and Harris have been to insist that protesters “have a point.” Sure, many naïve college kids have bought into the ludicrous and vile slur that Israel is committing “genocide” against Palestinians and should be destroyed. The truth, of course, is the complete opposite: Israel has sacrificed the lives of its own soldiers to protect Palestinians in Gaza and avoid civilian casualties; Hamas, Iran’s leaders and other Islamic radicals are the ones who seek genocide against Jews — and don’t care how many Palestinian lives are lost along the way. The kids get their skewed ideas, of course, from radical, left-wing professors and DEI agendas that paint Israel, and Jews, as oppressors. Yet now we know Iran has funded outside agitators, pro-Palestinian groups and likely some student organizations to drum up anti-Jewish hatred as well. Americans deserve to know how much funding. And which groups in particular. How, exactly, are Iranian funds used to support the violence? That info is vital, particularly now that classes — and “protests” — are resuming. On Monday, as Cornell held its first day of classes, anti-Israel hooligans smashed a glass doorway and spray-painted messages, such as “Israel bombs and Cornell pays.” Last week at Barnard College, they disrupted move-in day, and they’ve gathered at Columbia, too. Declassifying and publicizing info defeated Russia’s plans to stage a false-flag operation in Ukraine in 2022 to justify its invasion. It can help counter the protests, too. Beyond that, the public has a right to know how Iran is skewing US public discourse. Americans can’t fight an enemy they don’t realize is attacking them. Congress needs to force intel agencies to share what they know about Iran’s malicious handiwork.","summary":"With students returning to college, and Hamas-backers already resorting to campus mischief, it’s time to shine a spotlight on Iran’s protest-financing.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/26/opinion/force-intel-agencies-to-come-clean-about-irans-us-protest-funding/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/director-national-intelligence-avril-haines-86394244-e1724712213612.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-26 22:52:32","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.015},{"id":254981278,"title":"Tim Walz Gets DNC Boost as Kamala Harris Remains Constant: Poll","text":"Minnesota Governor Tim Walz received a boost in his approval rating following last week's Democratic National Convention, according to the latest polling from Morning Consult.A survey conducted over the weekend by the polling company found that 42 percent of registered voters hold a favorable view of Walz, who formally accepted his party's vice presidential nomination in Chicago. Before the convention, Walz had a 39 percent favorability rating, according to Morning Consult's polling.The four-day-long convention did not give Vice President Kamala Harris a polling boost among national voters, however. Morning Consult's polling found that the Democrats' presidential nominee still leads Donald Trump by 4 percentage points, which is the same lead she held according to polling a week before the convention.In Morning Consult's latest polling, which includes the responses of 7,818 registered voters surveyed between August 23 and 25, Harris is leading the Republican nominee 48 percent to 44 percent. The survey has a margin of error of 1 percent.Morning Consult said in its report on the presidential election, which was released Monday, that Harris has not trailed Trump in a \"daily tracking survey\" since the company began tracking head-to-head matchups between the two candidates in late July, when she entered the 2024 race.Newsweek reached out to both Harris and Trump's campaigns via email Monday for comment.Harris formally accepted her party's presidential nomination last Thursday, following a week of speeches from Democratic leaders and delegates who emphasized a message of \"freedom\" and hope. Harris contrasted her positions and policies with Trump's on multiple occasions throughout her nomination acceptance speech and called on voters to \"fight\" for democracy and \"the ideals we cherish.\"Other polling has shown that the vice president received a boost among voters nationwide after last week's convention. In a survey conducted by the Angus Reid Institute during the same week as the Democratic convention (August 19 to 23), Harris held a 5-point lead over Trump, 47 percent to 42 percent among registered voters. In a survey conducted by Angus Reid a month earlier, Harris was leading Trump by just 2 percentage points (44 percent to 42 percent).On average, Harris had held a more than 3-point lead in national polls since last Wednesday, according to a report by website FiveThirtyEight. As of Monday, the vice president is leading by 3.4 percentage points on average (47.1 percent to 43.7 percent).The Democratic convention also trumped the Republican National Convention in television viewership, according to ratings company Nielsen. An estimated 21.8 million viewers tuned into the Democratic convention across all four nights last week, while the RNC in July garnered just over 19 million viewers on average across all four nights.","summary":"Harris is still leading Donald Trump in the latest survey by Morning Consult.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/tim-walz-gets-dnc-boost-kamala-harris-remains-constant-poll-1944643","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2458226/walz-gets-dnc-boost-harris-remainsconstant.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-26 22:50:04","author":"Kaitlin Lewis","authors":["Kaitlin Lewis"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.532},{"id":254983386,"title":"James Blunt poses with Noel Gallagher during a vacation ahead of Oasis highly-anticipated announcement: 'The reunion the world has been waiting for!'","text":"Home News Royals U.S. Sport TV Showbiz Femail Health Science Money Travel Podcasts Shopping Best Buys Discounts My Profile Logout Login Headlines Showbiz Kim Kardashian Victoria Beckham Harry Styles Amanda Holden Britain's Got Talent My Profile Logout Login Privacy Policy Feedback Tuesday, Aug 27th 2024 1AM 12°C 4AM 11°C 5-Day Forecast Advertisement Singing legend Mariah Carey reveals her mother, 87, and sister, 63, BOTH died on the same day at the weekend - saying 'my heart is broken' in emotional statement Notting Hill Carnival cops are ordered to work, not twerk!

The You're Beautiful singer rocked a blue floral short sleeved shirt as he beamed for a snap with Noel during a holiday. James joked: 'IT’S ON - The reunion the world has been waiting for…' James and Noel have known each other for years and back in 2006, the Don’t Look Back In Anger singer lashed out at him when he was planning to buy a house in Ibiza next to him. At the time, Noel announced he would be selling his holiday home as he didn't want to stay next door to James knowing he would be making 'terrible music'. However, James claims to have had the last laugh as he claims property prices increased once Noel left the area. James Blunt has shared a photo with pal Noel Gallagher on Instagram on Monday ahead of Oasis' highly-anticipated reunion announcement James said: 'IT’S ON - The reunion the world has been waiting for…' Speaking on the Where There’s A Will There’s A Wake podcast, James said: 'I do actually bump into Noel at various places and he only says these things behind your back. To your face he’s a coward. He said he couldn’t have me writing my s****y songs just down the road from him.' It comes hours after Noel broke his silence on the Oasis reunion as he shared a cryptic clip to X - formerly known as Twitter - on Sunday. The singer, 57, suggested an announcement could be made on Tuesday 27, at 8:00am as he shared a short clip featuring the style of Oasis logo. The white rectangular box which a black block in the centre had the date \"27.08.24'' written in the middle where the band's name is usually seen then flickered and changed to read \"8am''. Noel did not share a caption along with the post but fans were left hoping he will reunite with brother Liam. They wrote: 'This has potential to be the best week of all time; OMG its happening; Already in the queue for tickets!' It comes as Liam dedicated the Oasis track Half The World Away to his estranged brother Noel during his headline set at the Reading Festival on Sunday evening - after burying the hatchet during a late night phone call. Earlier in the day, the Mancunian rocker fuelled speculation he might reunite with Noel for a long-awaited Oasis comeback, despite their well documented estrangement.

During his headline slot at Reading on Sunday, Liam, 51, performed a number of Oasis hits from their debut album Definitely Maybe to celebrate its 30th anniversary. Introducing Half The World Away - a 1994 B-side that also featured as the theme tune to sitcom The Royle Family - he told revellers: 'I wanna dedicate this song to Noel f**king Gallagher.' Read More How late-night phone calls ended Oasis feud - as Liam praises Noel on stage and £50m reunion 'is ON' Liam continued to keep fans guessing by dedicating his rendition of Cigarettes & Alcohol at the Reading Festival to people who hate Oasis. The track, written by his older brother, was the final single on their 1994 debut album Definitely Maybe. As he closed the set, Liam also suggested an announcement could be made on Tuesday at 8:00am as he shared the same short clip as Noel. A source told The Sun: 'Noel and Liam are never going to be the best of friends but they want to bring Oasis back for the fans. 'They aren’t getting any younger and the demand is huge. They decided it was now or never. Noel dug his heels in for a long time but has finally caved and agreed to return. 'He spoke to Liam on the phone and they are on the same page. They know this reunion will go down in music history.' Professor Jonathan Shalit OBE, chairman of talent agency InterTalent, told The Sun they could make more than £400million from the tour and any residual deals. He said: 'With tickets, sponsorship, merchandise and filming, I would predict an income for Noel and Liam of over £50million each. This is a tour that could easily gross over £400million.'

The eye-watering sum is said to have convinced warring brothers Noel and Liam to bury the hatchet 15 years after they last appeared on stage together. Their fractious relationship came to a head in 2009, after a backstage fight in Paris led to Noel, 57, leaving the band. In recent years, Liam has been keen to make amends with his brother and reform the iconic Britpop band, but his older brother poured cold water on the idea. But after Noel's £20m divorce from ex-wife Sara MacDonald last year, the elder Gallagher is said to have been persuaded of the financial merits of getting the band together for dates at Glastonbury and Wembley Stadium. It is expected to be the most popular tour in British concert history, with industry insiders saying the deal negotiated between the brothers will net them £50 million. It comes as Liam sent Oasis fans into frenzy, as he appeared to confirm the Don't Look Back In Anger singers would next year tour the country. Asked on X, formerly Twitter, about the planned Oasis shows, Liam wrote: 'See you down the front'. Oasis has been promised a payday of £50 million to reform and embark on a global tour, with Liam appearing to confirm the reunion It comes as Liam sent Oasis fans into frenzy, as he appeared to confirm the Don't Look Back In Anger singers would next year tour the country Asked on X, formerly Twitter, about the planned Oasis shows, Liam wrote: 'See you down the front' He later told his 3.6m followers on the platform: 'I never did like that word FORMER'. Despite the thawing in their relations, the younger Gallagher couldn't resist a dig at his brother. When asked what he would say to Noel when they return to the stage, he said: 'Keep up'. Fans have speculated Liam could confirm the reunion whilst on stage for his solo headline set at Reading Festival on Sunday night. An account for the Oasis Podcast posted on X: 'Liam I’m off to see you in Reading can you dedicate Columbia to the oasis podcast it’s my favourite song'whilst another wrote: 'waiting for liam to bring noel out at reading and announce a oasis reunion.' Liam has been touring the UK this summer on his Definitely Maybe tour to celebrate the 30 years since its release in 1994. Noel has been notably absent from the concerts, but during a show in Cardiff Liam made a point of dedicating Half The World Away to his 'little brother', saying he is 'still playing hard to get'. Liam also played a host of Oasis hits during his headline performance at Reading's sister site Leeds Festival on Friday night The tweets came after reports that the warring brothers have finally put aside their differences with 2025 gigs lined up at Glastonbury, Heaton Park in Manchester, and a 10-day run at Wembley Stadium. After Noel's £20m divorce from ex-wife Sara MacDonald last year, the elder Gallagher is said to have been persuaded of the financial merits of getting the band together Read More Fans go wild as Oasis look set to take over summer 2025 with comeback gigs The tour is expected to take in dates in the UK at the Glastonbury festival and stadiums including Wembley, Twickenham and the Tottenham Hotspur stadium, as well as a run of dates at Liam and Noel Gallagher's beloved Etihad Stadium, home to Manchester City football club. It is understood that two huge promoters - SJM Concerts and Live Nation - are in the running to land the tour, which would include dates across Europe and in America. As the Mail on Sunday revealed, Glastonbury have informed the band that a headline slot at next summer's festival has been 'left open' for Oasis in the increasingly likely event the band confirm a reunion. A music industry source said that a possible ten nights at Wembley Stadium next summer, surpassing the eight-gig record recently set by Taylor Swift, would be a 'tough ask' at this stage of the year with bookings at the iconic London venue already at a near maximum. 'There will be a run of dates at Wembley if the Oasis tour goes ahead, but it's a bit late to confirm a run of 10 dates now,' said a music industry source. 'Instead the tour is likely to take in other big stadiums in London, and in Manchester. Heaton Park is another possibility up there, as is a repeat of Liam Gallagher's more recent gigs at Knebworth.' 10 gigs at Wembley in 2025 would break Taylor Swift's recent record at the venue. The Cruel Summer songstress, 34, played eight shows at the north London venue to delighted crowds in June and August - making her the first solo artist to play the stadium that many times. She told the screaming audience: 'You have made me the first solo artist to play Wembley eight times on a single tour!' On Thursday, a video was released to mark the 30th anniversary of Definitely Maybe, Oasis's debut album. Despite the thawing in their relations, Liam couldn't resist a dig at his brother. When asked what he would say to Noel when they return to the stage, he said: 'Keep up' Liam and Noel Gallagher, Andy Bell and Gem Archer pictured together in February 2006 at the Bangkok 100 Rock Festival Fans have speculated Liam could confirm the reunion whilst on stage for his solo headline set at Reading Festival on Sunday night. Read More Inside Liam and Noel Gallagher's tumultuous sibling rivalry amid rumours Oasis are set for comeback In the video, Noel - who previously said 'I liked my Mum until she gave birth to Liam' - was unusually complimentary about his little brother. He said: 'When I would sing a song, it would sound good. When he sung it, it sounded great.' Noel added: 'I can't sing Cigarettes & Alcohol, Rock'n'Roll Star and all that. I don't have the same attitude as him.' 'My voice is half a Guinness on a Tuesday — it's all right. Liam's is ten shots of tequila on a Friday.' Fans were also surprised to hear Noel pay Liam a string of compliments. Reflecting on Liam's performance on a number of their hits, Noel said: 'It's the delivery or the tone of his voice and the attitude. 'I don't have the same attitude as him.' Next Wednesday will mark 15 years since Noel sensationally quit Oasis 'with great relief' following a backstage bust-up in Paris saying: 'I simply could not go on working with Liam a day longer.' The Paris bust up included a barrage of insults being traded and a guitar being 'wielded like an axe', to end a 15-year career which saw its fair share of Rock and roll antics from both siblings. Last year, Noel joked in an interview on Radio X that he would 'properly consider' getting Oasis back together if he was given £8 million. Asked whether it annoys him when people ask about a reunion, he said: 'It used to really annoy me when I first started and now it's just, it's just whatever... The band's break-up came after a backstage bust-up in Paris, including a barrage of insults being traded and a guitar being 'wielded like an axe' (The Gallaghers pictured in 2003) Fans couldn't be happier as they penned on X: 'Oasis reunion will be up there with the birth of my child' Read More EXCLUSIVE Oasis are set for a £50million payday amid Noel's £20million divorce 'I'm fascinated with people asking the same question and getting the same answer, but the thing that is ongoing and will never get old is how the music just keeps appealing to another generation of fans.' Formed in the 1990s, the Britpop group rose to fame with hits like Wonderwall, Don't Look Back In Anger and Stop Crying Your Heart Out. They went on to become arguably one of the biggest bands in British music history before their break-up in 2009. The brothers went on to have successful solo careers, with Noel fronting the group Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds. Fans said of the possible reunion on social media: 'Felt it's always been on the cards since Noel's divorce. I haven't been Glastonbury for two years (thanks Rowan) so go make a return when Oasis play it could be up there with Macca for me. Others said: 'Oasis reunion will be up there with the birth of my child.', 'I am very sceptical about the Oasis reunion rumours but something seems different this time. To see them live together in my lifetime would be amazing. Please...', 'Oasis Reunion announcement? @liamgallagher Come on; Oasis reunion is a done deal I'm hearing yus; Oasis reunion making a particular kind of white dude (me) make incredibly irresponsible financial decisions.'

One, she’s not a very strong candidate, not a good extemporaneous speaker. Why showcase her weakness? And two, staying away from the traditional venue for communication and scrutiny — that is, interactions with the press — has allowed Harris aides to float the idea that she has changed positions and moved to the center from her failed run for the Democratic nomination in 2019, when she was solidly in the progressive lane of the party. By using aides to float her new positions, she can put out words without putting her own face on them, leaving the impression that she has changed views without actually saying so. On Aug. 8, Harris was asked when she would do an interview. “I want us to get an interview scheduled before the end of the month,” she answered. Her answer had an odd feeling to it, as if she had deigned to take a few questions but not anytime soon. The campaign has not given any further information about the interview, although there aren’t that many days left in the month. Subscribe today to the Washington Examiner magazine that will keep you up to date with what’s going on in Washington. SUBSCRIBE NOW: Just $1.00 an issue! You would think the press would be up in arms about this. Instead, many journalists have accepted Harris’s gambit at face value. News programs are filled with speculation about The Interview: When will it be? Who will Harris choose to do it? What will she say? On some news outlets, the conversation is more about a single, unannounced interview than it is about news conferences, multiple interviews, and daily access — what should be happening in a normal campaign. On the other part of Harris’s strategy, the obfuscation of policy, Harris has succeeded spectacularly. There is now a media consensus that Harris has moderated some of her most left-leaning positions of the past, even though Harris herself has not announced any specific change. It has all been done by anonymous aides. Does that carry the weight of a statement from the candidate herself? Of course it doesn’t. If Harris has really changed her views rather than send up a trial balloon via a campaign aide, she should tell the voters herself. An example of how this works took place on ABC’s This Week. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) told the moderator, ABC’s Jonathan Karl, that in the coming campaign, former President Donald Trump is “going to draw a sharp contrast with Kamala Harris, who has supported things like decriminalizing illegal immigration or giving taxpayer-funded health insurance to illegal aliens or taking away health insurance on the job for 170 million Americans, banning gas cars, confiscating firearms. These are all—” Karl interrupted, “What do you mean taking away health insurance? What are you talking about?” Cotton responded that Harris “said when she ran for president that she wants to eliminate private health insurance on the job of 170 million Americans.” Karl said, “I mean, that is not her position now.” “How do you know that’s not her position?” Cotton asked. “How do you know that’s not her position?” Karl answered that Harris has “said she no longer supports ‘Medicare for All.'” “She has not said that,” Cotton responded. “She has not said that. She has not said that. Maybe anonymous aides on a Friday night have said that.” Indeed, look at this article from Politico last week: “Harris co-sponsored Sen. Bernie Sanders’ Medicare for All legislation when she was a California senator and offered a modified plan as the centerpiece of her short-lived 2020 presidential bid. But a campaign official told Politico it is no longer part of Harris’s agenda.” That’s how it works. Harris purportedly backs down, by proxy, from her old position, and the press accept it. When Cotton noted that Harris had not said herself that she no longer supports Medicare for All, Karl responded that Harris is “clearly making an effort to move to the middle.” Karl appeared to credit Harris with moving toward the middle when Harris herself had said nothing to indicate that she was, in fact, moving toward the middle. Two weeks ago, in an appearance with Fox News’s Bret Baier, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley had some advice for Republicans. “Quit complaining that she’s [Harris] not giving an interview,” Haley said. “You don’t need an interview from Kamala Harris. I take her at her word.” Indeed, there is an extensive record, much of it on video, of Harris making her views clear on issues like taxes, healthcare, immigration, energy, and others. Since she has never renounced or changed those statements, don’t they remain her views, at least until she says otherwise?

Trump during remarks at a National Guard Association conference in Detroit seemed to opposed Ukraine’s recent push into western Russia. ‘Look at what’s happening in Ukraine. They’re surging into Russia,’ Trump said on Monday afternoon. ‘You’re going to have World War 3.’ Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump attended and spoke at a ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery on Monday, marking three years since the August 26, 2021, suicide bombing at Hamid Karzai International Airport (Picture: Getty Images) The Republican candidate also blamed the Biden-Harris administration for continuing to support Ukraine and attributed that to the US military’s own ammunition supply running low. Trump appeared to reference a report that found the US would be out of arms in three to four weeks if it became involved in a war with China. ‘These people are just so destructive,’ he said of American officials. ‘So – you know I always look for good words. Highly sophisticated, (I’m) highly educated. I like sophisticated words, but there’s only one word I can – stupid, they’re stupid people.’ Trump bashed the administration hours after speaking at Arlington National Cemetery at a memorial service for 13 US service members who were killed during the messy pullout from Afghanistan three years ago.

The chaotic withdrawal and ISIS suicide bomber attack at Abbey Gate outside of Kabul International Airport ‘gave us Russia going into Ukraine, it gave us the October 7 attack in Israel’, Trump claimed. Trump also invited to the stage in Detroit, former Democratic congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, who announced she was endorsing him and vowed to do all she could to help him win the November election. Gabbard, who left the Democratic Party in 2022, said Trump was the country’s best shot at stepping back from nuclear warfare.

Meanwhile, an Echelon Insights survey showed that Trump had a 49% to 48% lead over Harris after Robert F Kennedy Jr suspended his independent campaign and threw his support to Trump last week.

Vice President Kamala Harris, in a morning statement shared to her official White House social media accounts, noted the suicide bombing that took place in Kabul on August 26, 2021, claimed the lives of 13 U.S. military troops and more than 100 Afghan civilians and injured dozens of others, before listing the names of the slain service members. “Today, and everyday, I mourn and honor them. My prayers are with their families and loved ones. My heart breaks for their loss. These 13 devoted patriots represent the best of America, putting our beloved nation and their fellow Americans above themselves and deploying into danger to keep their fellow citizens safe,” she wrote. The war in Afghanistan, started less than a month after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, claimed the lives of 2,461 U.S. service members and left more than 20,000 injured, Harris pointed out. President Joe Biden’s decision to carry through with plans put in place by the Trump Administration to end the war was the right one, she said. “President Biden made the courageous and right decision to end America’s longest war. Over the past three years our administration has demonstrated we can still eliminate terrorists, including the leaders of al-Qaeda and ISIS, without troops deployed into combat zones,” she said. Harris encouraged the nation, “on this solemn day,” to “come together as one” to honor the sacrifice of those killed, injured, or impacted by the nearly two-decades long war. Former President Donald Trump stopped by Arlington National Cemetery on Monday for a wreath laying ceremony, after which his campaign claimed that Harris “has refused to say the names of the 13 servicemembers who gave their lives on August 26, 2021\" despite her including those names in her statement. Trump also took to his Truth Social media account to take a swing at Harris, and attempted to pin the suicide bombing at Hamid Karzai International Airport on her, despite the fact the Vice President does not serve in any capacity anywhere in the military’s chain of command, except as a substitute for a disabled or deceased president. “Three years ago, Kamala’s and Biden’s incompetence left 13 dead warriors, hundreds of civilians killed and grievously wounded, and $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment on the planet abandoned to the Taliban,” he wrote, conflating the total U.S. investment into Afghanistan with the money spent on equipment for the Afghan police and military. “This is the third anniversary of the BOTCHED Afghanistan withdrawal, the most EMBARRASSING moment in the history of our Country. Gross Incompetence – 13 DEAD American soldiers, hundreds of people wounded and dead, AMERICANS and BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF MILITARY EQUIPMENT LEFT BEHIND. You don’t take our soldiers out first, you take them out LAST, when all else is successfully done. Russia then invaded Ukraine, Israel was attacked, and the USA became, and is, a laughing stock all over the World. THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA REMAINS SILENT IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE WORST ADMINISTRATION IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY! MAGA2024,” Trump wrote, capitalization his. Trump’s administration agreed to the withdrawal of all U.S. military members from Afghanistan in February, 2020, in a deal signed with the Taliban. Trump, at the time, said the plan to leave the country in the next 14 months was a good one, and that “we think we’ll be successful in the end,” but that “if bad things happen, we’ll go back.”","summary":"The war in Afghanistan, started less than a month after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, claimed the lives of 2,461 U.S. service members and left more than 20,000 injured, Harris pointed out.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2024/08/26/trump-harris-mark-end-to-war-in-afghanistan-with-strikingly-different-messages/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AP21243461333851.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-26 22:44:53","author":"Matthew Medsger","authors":["Matthew Medsger"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.163},{"id":254981062,"title":"Kamala Harris May Have a New Swing State Worry","text":"A court's decision in Wisconsin, an important swing state in this year's election, to keep Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein on the ballot in November could deal a blow to Vice President Kamala Harris' chances of defeating former President Donald Trump.On Monday, the Wisconsin Supreme Court rejected an attempt by a Democratic National Committee (DNC) official to knock Stein off the state's ballot this year, ruling that \"the petitioner is not entitled to the relief he seeks.\"Republican Party attorneys backed the effort to keep Stein on the ballot, likely in hopes that her appeal to some left-wing voters will siphon off enough support from Harris, the Democratic nominee, to secure victory for Trump, the GOP's nominee, this year.Stein previously ran as the Green Party's candidate for president in 2012 and 2016. In 2020, when President Joe Biden won Wisconsin against Trump by just over 20,000 votes, Green Party candidate Howie Hawkins did not appear on the ballot.Some have blamed Stein for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton losing to Trump in 2016—the Green Party candidate received over 31,000 votes in Wisconsin and Trump won the state by just under 23,000 votes.In 2020, Hawkins received little more than 1,000 votes as a write-in candidate in Wisconsin. It is not clear how many Biden voters might have backed Hawkins if his name had been on the ballot.While it's also unclear how many potential Stein voters might back Harris instead if she were not on the ballot, a relatively small number of votes could prove consequential if this year's election outcome is as close as previous races.Newsweek reached out for comment to the Harris campaign via email on Monday evening.An average of recent polls compiled by FiveThirtyEight finds that Harris currently has a 3.6 percent lead over Trump in Wisconsin as of Monday evening. None of the polls that included Stein as an option showed her higher than 1 percent.In 2016, Stein won around 1 percent of the vote in Wisconsin. While support for third-party and independent presidential candidates tends to diminish as Election Day approaches, a similar performance this year spells trouble for the Harris campaign if it corresponds with a decline in support for the Democrat.Earlier on Monday, a judge delivered another dose of potentially bad news for Harris by reinstating independent presidential candidate Cornel West to the ballot in Michigan, which is also a swing state that could also prove to be decisive this year.West, who is polling at under 1 percent like Stein, previously ran as a Green Party candidate with Stein's backing. Republican lawyers have been supporting his efforts to appear on ballots across the country.Independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. suspended his campaign last week and endorsed Trump while announcing that he intends to remove his name from the ballot in swing states to avoid acting as a \"spoiler\" candidate and hurting the former president's chances of reelection.Stein told Newsweek shortly after Kennedy Jr. endorsed Trump that she would remain in the race and would never back Harris, regardless of concerns that she could contribute to a Trump victory.","summary":"The Wisconsin Supreme Court on Monday allowed a third-party candidate who could siphon votes from Harris to remain on the ballot.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/kamala-harris-may-have-new-swing-state-worry-1944607","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2458245/kamala-harris-wisconsin-jill-stein-2024-election.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-26 22:43:10","author":"Aila Slisco","authors":["Aila Slisco"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.164},{"id":254983470,"title":"Gold Star Families Rip Biden, Harris on Third Anniversary of Abbey Gate Bombing: 'They Just Want to Pretend It Didn't Happen'","text":"Gold Star Family members of several of the 13 U.S. servicemembers killed during the Biden-Harris administration’s disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan were highly critical of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris on Monday, with one saying, “They just want to pretend it never happened.” Gold Star Family members of Marine Corps Sgt. Nicole L. Gee, Marine Corps Lance Cpl. Jared M. Schmitz, and Marine Corps Cpl. Hunter Lopez joined Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance (OH) and Reps. Derrick Van Orden (R-WI) and Ryan Zinke (R-MT) on a press call that Breitbart News attended on Monday — the third anniversary of the Abbey Gate bombing at the Kabul International Airport that claimed these young servicemembers’ lives. Gee’s aunt, Cheryl Juels, said that there have “never even been condolences” offered from the Biden-Harris administration over the loss of her niece’s life. “They just want to pretend it didn’t happen. They want to take credit for ending the war, but they don’t want to take any responsibility for the way it all went down,” she added. Juels added that the reports her family received were “flawed.” “It’s been a cover-up from the beginning. Every report we get is flawed. It doesn’t contain everything that happened,” she said. “It’s just cherry-picked — what they want to put in it — and they just want to close the whole thing and wrap it up, say, ‘Everything was a success,’ and it wasn’t.” After calling for a “truthful investigation” and “changes” to ensure a similar catastrophe does not occur, she declared that America’s servicemembers “deserve to know that there’s a commander-in-chief like President [Donald] Trump, who’s gonna respect them and protect them.” Gold Star Mom Alicia Lopez, the mother of Hunter Lopez, highlighted Harris and Biden’s “lack of responsibility.” “And for them to think that it’s okay and to treat it as another page in a book that they’re just flipping over for the next chapter, it saddens me and frightens me all at the same time,” she said. “I do have a son that’s currently serving, and I pray that I don’t get another knock on my door because of the lack of responsibility this administration has for our military.” She added that she wants to see someone elected who has America’s servicemen and servicewomen’s “best interest at heart and will support our military, and we can get rid of this administration that does not care about them at all.” Gold Star Father Mark Schmitz zoned in on “the lies and the corruption and the cover-ups that have happened since” the Abbey Gate bombing that claimed the life of his son, Jared, and the catastrophic withdrawal. He spoke directly to Democrat politicians and slammed Democrat members of Congress for giving “softball questions” to the likes of Secretary of State Antony Blinken during committee hearings about the withdrawal. “My message is directly to all Democrat politicians. I have watched these committee hearings with Blinken, with [Ret. Gen. Mark] Milley, with [Ret. General Kenneth] McKenzie, and I’m growing so sick and tired of the softball questions that get lobbed up there,” he said. “This is not a Republican versus Democrat issue. This is an American issue. This is a lack of leadership, and this is the result, and America needs to recognize that when choosing a leader.” “But, in support of that leader are our congressmen and our senators, and I have watched over and over again as they continually made excuse after excuse, trying to throw Trump under the bus, trying to blame him for everything,” Schmitz added. “Trump’s not perfect — we all know that — nobody is. But, when it comes to this issue of Afghanistan, it seems to be a party line issue across the board over and over again, and that has got to stop.”","summary":"Gold Star Family members ripped Joe Biden and Kamala Harris's disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal on Monday.\n\n\nThe post Gold Star Families Rip Biden, Harris on Third Anniversary of Abbey Gate Bombing: &#8216;They Just Want to Pretend It Didn&#8217;t Happen&#8217; appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2024/08/26/gold-star-families-rip-biden-harris-on-third-anniversary-of-abbey-gate-bombing-they-just-want-to-pretend-it-didnt-happen/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/08/Biden-1-640x335.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-26 22:39:19","author":"Nick Gilbertson","authors":["Nick Gilbertson"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.573},{"id":254981354,"title":"Former Democrat Tulsi Gabbard endorses Donald Trump in 2024 presidential race","text":"Aug. 26 (UPI) -- Former Democratic Rep.

Today, I endorsed Donald Trump for president,\" Gabbard added Monday in a post on X. During Monday's speech, Gabbard talked about her time serving in the Iraq War, the high price of ongoing conflicts and what the Republican nominee would do to end it. \"I am confident that his first task will be to do the work to walk us back from the brink of war,\" she said. \"We cannot be prosperous unless we are at peace and we can't live free as long as we have a government that is retaliating against its political opponents and undermining our civil liberties, weaponizing our very institutions against those they deem as a threat,\" Gabbard said before turning to Kamala Harris, who she claimed has \"done this over the last 3.5 years.\" \"President Trump has been their first and foremost target in this because they don't want us as voters to even have the option to vote for him. I've been their most recent target added to a secret domestic terror watch list after exposing the truth about what kind of dangers we would face if Kamala Harris is elected as president,\" Gabbard said. \"We as Americans must reject this anti-freedom culture of political retaliation and abuse of power. We can't allow our country to be destroyed by politicians who will put their own power ahead of the interests of the American people, our freedom and our future,\" she added. \"I am proud to stand here before you today, whether you're a Democrat, a Republican or an independent. If you love our country as I do, if you cherish peace and freedom as we do, I invite you to join me in doing all that we can to save our country and elect President Donald J. Trump,\" Gabbard concluded. Gabbard's endorsement comes days after Robert F. Kennedy Jr. ended his independent run for president and joined forces with Trump, adding that he would be removing his name from the ballot in battleground states. Kennedy endorsed Trump on Friday and appeared with the Republican nominee at a rally in Arizona. Gabbard, who ran for president in 2020 as a Democrat, announced in 2022 that she was leaving the Democratic Party to become an independent. She said she could \"no longer remain in today's Democratic Party,\" which she claimed is under control of \"an elitist cabal of warmongers driven by cowardly wokeness who divide us by racializing every issue.\" In addition to endorsing the former president, Gabbard has been tapped to work with Trump in preparation for his upcoming debate with Harris, which is scheduled for Sept. 10.","summary":"Former Democratic Rep.

Nor does he try to,’ Kirby said in a zoom briefing with reporters. ‘He’s very much in command,’ he noted of Biden. He pointed out Biden spoke with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday and talked to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday as proof the president is working. Biden, 81, is at his beach home in Rehoboth, Delaware, after spending a week at a private 8,000 acre ranch in Santa Ynez, Calif. He is scheduled to return to the White House after Labor Day weekend. Vice President Kamala Harris is in Washington D.C. with nothing on her public schedule until Wednesday, when she heads to Georgia for a two-day bus trip to campaign in the state. The White House has long argued Biden can perform the duties of president where ever he goes. When the president travels, a staff member on the National Security Council travels with him to keep him briefed on foreign affairs and a staffer in the chief of staff’s office is with him to keep him updated on domestic matters. He and first lady Jill Biden arrived at their multi-million dollar beach house in Rehoboth on Sunday evening. Biden is on his 114th visit to Delaware spanning all or part of 328 days, according to journalist Mark Knoeller who tracks presidential travel. That is much more when compared to Donald Trump at a similar point in office: he spent 51 visits and 240 days at either of his estates in Mar-a-Lago, Fla., or Bedminster, N.J. It’s the second week in a row of downtime for the Bidens. They jetted off to Santa Ynez, California, on Monday night after Biden addressed the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. The couple – along with their children and grandchildren – stayed at a California ranch owned by Democratic donor billionaire Joe Kiani. The property sits about three hours north of Los Angeles in Santa Barbara wine country. Kiani has been a major donor to Biden’s campaigns and a friend to the family. Hunter Biden paid a visit to the $50 million vineyard property last year. Dubbed the ‘Kiani Preserve,’ the 8,000 acres has its own private vineyard, donkeys and a cattle herd. The vineyard on the property produces bottles of Shiraz and Cabernet Sauvignon, among other wines. The president doesn’t drink but the first lady is known to enjoy a glass or two of wine. Biden exited the presidential race on July 21 after his terrible debate performance against Donald Trump, which led to concerns about his mental abilities. ‘Over the next six months, I’ll be focused on doing my job as president,’ Biden said in his July 24 Oval Office address. This Monday, Biden remained out of sight as his predecessor — and possible successor — Donald Trump visited Arlington National Cemetery to pay tribute to the 13 Americans killed three years ago in a bombing outside the Kabul airport during the Afghanistan evacuation. The former president laid a series of wreaths at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and then paid a private visit to section 60, the area of the cemetery where those killed in Afghanistan are buried. He was joined by family members of some of the U.S. soldiers who were killed in a bombing at Abbey Gate. He was also was accompanied by two Marines who were injured in attack: Cpl. Kelsee Lainhart, who was paralyzed in the attack and now uses a wheelchair, and Sgt. Tyler Vargas-Andrews, who lost his right arm and left leg. The visit also enabled him to tie his rival Kamala Harris to what he calls ‘the most embarrassing moment in our history.’ Trump has repeatedly criticized President Joe Biden’s handling of the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. Biden was in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, on Monday, starting the second week of his summer vacation. The visit also allowed Trump to counter reports he doesn’t respect veterans and has previously referred to slain World War II soldiers as suckers and losers, reports Trump has denied. The former president laid three wreaths at the tomb, two honoring Staff Sgt. Taylor Hoover and Sgt. Nicole Gee – two Marines killed in the bombing – and another wreath dedicated to all 13 service members who were killed in the attack. He also took flowers to the grave of SSG Ryan Knauss – a Marine killed in the attack – and spoke to Knauss’ parents who couldn’t be there, according to his campaign. Spotted with Trump at the event was Tulsi Gabbard, the former Democratic congresswoman who is now helping Trump with his debate prep. Monday marks three years since the Aug. 26, 2021, suicide bombing at Hamid Karzai International Airport, which killed 13 American service members and more than 100 Afghans. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the attack. ‘This is the third anniversary of the BOTCHED Afghanistan withdrawal, the most EMBARRASSING moment in the history of our Country,’ Trump posted on Truth Social. ‘Gross Incompetence – 13 DEAD American soldiers, hundreds of people wounded and dead, AMERICANS and BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF MILITARY EQUIPMENT LEFT BEHIND.’ Some of the relatives of those killed appeared on stage at the Republican National Convention last month, saying Biden had never publicly named their loved ones. After Biden ended his re-election bid, Trump has endeavored to tie Harris to some of the administration’s most-criticized moments. He’s noted Harris has said she was the last person in the room before Biden made the decision on Afghanistan. The Biden administration conducted a two-year internal review of the evacuation and found that U.S. officials should have started the evacuation earlier, but placed extensive blame on Trump, Biden’s predecessor in the Oval Office. Biden’s team cited an agreement Trump made with the Taliban to pull forces from Afghanistan. The White House took a swipe at Trump’s visit to the cemetery, seeming to indicate it was merely for the television cameras. ‘There are many ways that we as a nation and our leaders can observe the third anniversary of Abby Gate, and Mr. Trump was invited by at least one, I think maybe several of the families, to lay a wreath at Arlington and that is certainly a way to recognize the sacrifice and the loss. But it was a personal invitation by fans,’ White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said. ‘Another way is to continue to work, maybe not with a lot of fanfare, maybe not with a lot of public attention, maybe not with TV cameras, but to work’ every day to ‘make sure that the families of those of the fallen and of those who were injured and wounded, not just at Abbey Gate, but over the course of the 20 some odd years that we were in Afghanistan, had the support that they need,’ he added. Kirby noted the Biden’s long association with military, including the first lady’s work for Joining Forces. The White House released separate statements Monday by Harris and Biden on the attack. Harris said she mourns the 13 U.S. service members who were killed. ‘My prayers are with their families and loved ones. My heart breaks for their pain and their loss,’ she said. She said she honors and remembers all Americans who served in Afghanistan. ‘As I have said, President Biden made the courageous and right decision to end America’s longest war. Over the past three years, our Administration has demonstrated we can still eliminate terrorists, including the leaders of al-Qaeda and ISIS, without troops deployed into combat zones,’ she said. ‘I will never hesitate to take whatever action necessary to counter terrorist threats and protect the American people.’ Biden also paid tribute to the fallen. ‘Three years ago, an ISIS suicide bomber launched an attack of deliberate evil at Abbey Gate outside of Kabul Airport—killing 13 American service members and more than 100 innocent Afghans. Today, and every day, we honor our fallen,’ he said. ‘These 13 Americans – and the many more that were wounded – were patriots in the highest sense,’ Biden said in the statement.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe White House on Monday revealed who is running the country with&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: White House discloses who is in charge while 81-year-old Joe Biden is on his second week of vacation first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/white-house-discloses-who-is-in-charge-while-81-year-old-joe-biden-is-on-his-second-week-of-vacation/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/08/26/22/88953825-13781717-image-a-15_1724706159502.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-26 22:32:49","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.011},{"id":254981700,"title":"For young adults, it's all about the economy","text":"It’s no surprise the nation’s economy looms large in the minds of voters as they prepare to head to the polls in November. Despite all the talk and numbers showing the country’s economic landscape has improved over the past four years, many people — and that includes younger adults — are not feeling it where it counts most: Their pockets. So says a national poll of 2,000 young adults between the ages of 18 and 40 released last week by the University of Chicago Institute of Politics. Overall, 25% of those polled cited income inequality (11%) or economic growth (14%) as the biggest problems facing the country. That’s a far higher figure than the percentage of respondents who cited the environment and climate change (4%), immigration (10%), gun control (5%), LGBTQ rights (1%) or some other issue on a long list of concerns. In addition, 56% of respondents described the nation’s economy as either “somewhat” (32%) or “very” (24%) poor. The importance of the economy, relative to other issues, largely held true across racial lines, the poll found. That’s important to note: Economic issues — buying a home, paying for college — remain dominant, even as America is becoming more diverse. Young people of color are “a critical part of our political community, part of the democracy,” as one of the poll’s lead organizers, University of Chicago political science professor Cathy Cohen, noted to WBEZ’s Adriana Cardona-Maguigad. The poll was taken before Vice President Kamala Harris became the Democratic Party’s official nominee. But the findings make clear that, with the election slightly over two months away, Harris and Republican nominee Donald Trump have work to do: They must put forward a clear plan for how to build the nation’s economy and reassure younger voters that they can still climb the economic ladder. The Gen X’ers and millennials who were the respondents to the U of C survey are not the only group feeling fiscal anxiety. Members of Generation X — those born between 1965 and 1980 — are fearful they won’t have enough money to enjoy a traditional retirement, the Wall Street Journal reported last week. Inflation and the economy has consistently ranked high among voter concerns as the election approaches. Who can fix the country? For anyone concerned about voter engagement among young people, the survey has good news: 59% of respondents said they are following election news “quite a bit” or “a great deal,” while another 25% said they are following it “only some.” And 55% said they “definitely” plan to vote; another 15% said they will “probably” do so; and only 12% said they “definitely” or “probably” won’t cast their ballot. The survey covered a range of issues, including sources that respondents rely on for news; civic and political participation; views on the Supreme Court and our two-party political system; the environment; abortion; immigration; artificial intelligence; the war in Gaza; gun violence; and free speech and diversity on college campuses. Concerning the economy, inflation ranked as the biggest concern for 54% of respondents. And when asked about the biggest issue facing their community, 19% said the ability to afford housing — more than any other issue, including gun violence and education. The poll found 70% of respondents said the country is headed in the wrong direction, and 58% disagreed with the statement, “Today, democracy in the U.S. is working.” Put together, the responses show young adults are skeptical about our ability as a nation to right the ship economically. Political strategist James Carville famously said it back in 1992, and it’s no less true today: “It’s the economy, stupid.” As the election season enters the final stretch, the poll provides plenty of food for thought and grist for policy changes that need to happen. Candidates up and down the ballot should take note. The Sun-Times welcomes letters to the editor and op-eds. See our guidelines.

Bush and the late George H.W. Bush, the late Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), and Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT), criticized former President Donald Trump as a threat to democracy, eliciting a clap-back from the Trump campaign. “It’s hilarious because nobody knows who these people are,” Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung told the Washington Examiner. “They would rather see the country burn down than to see President Trump successfully return to the White House to Make America Great Again.” The GOP opposition was reminiscent of a similar anti-Trump group that backed President Joe Biden in 2020. The group included former McCain chiefs of staff Mark Salter and Chris Koch, former McCain Legislative Director Joe Donoghue, McCain’s 2008 campaign press secretary Jennifer Lux, and George H.W. Bush chief of staff Jean Becker. “We reunite today, joined by new George H.W. Bush alumni, to reinforce our 2020 statements and, for the first time, jointly declare that we’re voting for Vice President Kamala Harris and Gov. Tim Walz this November,” the letter stated. “Of course, we have plenty of honest, ideological disagreements with Vice President Harris and Gov. Walz. That’s to be expected. The alternative, however, is simply untenable.” The Republicans credited Biden’s win to “moderate Republicans and conservative independents in key swing states” based on exit polling. The group also criticized Trump’s “chaotic leadership” and the conservative Project 2025 road map for a second term that Trump has distanced himself from and said the plan would “hurt real, everyday people and weaken our sacred institutions.” “Abroad, democratic movements will be irreparably jeopardized as Trump and his acolyte JD Vance kowtow to dictators like Vladimir Putin while turning their backs on our allies,” the letter said.

Last week former President Donald Trump gave a thumbs-up to the notion of teaming up with billionaire innovator Elon Musk if he wins in November. Hours later, Musk posted a message on X: “I am willing to serve.” Elon Musk for Commerce secretary? Or perhaps for the newly created position of Free Speech Czar? Whether or not Musk actually joins a Trump administration — Trump himself said Sunday that the mogul is likely too busy to do so, but could “consult” — his bold steps to back the Republican signal a turnaround. Musk voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Joe Biden in 2020. Yet last month he launched a pro-Trump super PAC, which he and several other tech moguls are funding— even though Trump would likely remove federal subsidies for EVs, a major Musk industry, if he wins a second term. Investor and “Shark Tank” star Mark Cuban called the phenomenon of tech bosses boosting Trump “insane.” Not really: While Democrats strove mightily last week to push “freedom” as the theme of their convention, tech leaders are betting that freedom of speech, freedom to innovate and freedom from crushing government regulations and confiscatory taxes are more likely in a Trump reign than in a Kamala Harris administration. Among those Silicon Valley heavyweights is Nicole Shanahan, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s running mate. “I would say that I trust the future of this country more under the leadership of Trump . . . than I do right now under Harris,” Shanahan said last week as Kennedy weighed his decision to back Trump in the race. Harris’ economic plans, Shanahan warned — “particularly her flawed ideas about price caps on food” — echo “the very policies that caused the famine my family suffered through in Mao’s Communist China.” The RNC platform, dictated largely by Trump himself, pledges lower taxes and deregulation, and describes innovators as national treasures. In contrast, the Democrats’ 2024 platform vilifies businesses as greedy profiteers who don’t pay “their fair share” and proposes hiking corporate taxes to 28% and raising taxes on capital gains. Andreessen Horowitz, a Silicon Valley venture capital firm, said in December that it would decide which presidential ticket to support based on one issue: “If a candidate supports an optimistic technology-enabled future, we are for them. If they want to choke off important technologies, we are against them.” The firm called “bad government policies” the No. 1 threat to their industry. Trump has expressed his enthusiasm for new technologies, even promising to “make America first in AI.” By July, Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, the investment firm’s principals, had changed sides and endorsed Trump, saying the Republican will reduce regulation and lower taxes. When Trump chose running mate JD Vance, a venture capitalist with Silicon Valley experience, tech entrepreneurs applauded. PayPal founder David Sacks is throwing his support to Trump and even spoke at the Republican National Convention. Palantir Technologies cofounder Joe Lonsdale and cryptocurrency kings Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss are donating to Musk’s America PAC to back Trump. Of course, the tech industry is an industry like any other, concerned with what government can do to damage the business environment. Expect more tech leaders to change sides if Harris and Walz roll out policy proposals as misguided as those we’ve seen so far, like price controls. Big Tech reacts to bad economic policies at every level, not just federal. The same political metamorphosis bringing tech figures to Trump is also causing thousands of firms to flee California’s high taxes and overbearing regulations and relocate to Texas. They’re trading woke for business-friendly. Austin, the state capital, has become a tech hub dubbed Silicon Hills. Musk announced recently he is moving his companies X and Space X to Texas. Yet Musk is more than a Silicon Valley titan — he is also a crusader for free speech. Last month he stared down a European Union bureaucrat who objected that Musk’s uncensored two-hour conversation with Trump on X could result in “disinformation.” “Take a big step back,” Musk responded via a cheeky meme, after blasting the bureaucrat for his “alarming disregard for freedom of expression.” Musk recently closed X in Brazil rather than comply with government censors there. X is suspended in Venezuela for refusing to take down posts challenging dictator Nicolás Maduro’s phony victory claims. Ending government censorship is a top Republican priority. The Biden-Harris administration has used agencies from the FBI to the Department of Health and Human Services to pressure social media to do the administration’s bidding. The RNC platform pledges that federal interference will stop. Musk wants “to promote the principles that made America great in the first place,” naming meritocracy and free speech among the core ideas his America PAC is pushing. They’re not on Harris’ agenda — more reasons tech money is moving to Trump. You don’t need AI to figure that out.

[+] common perceptions. getty Did you know that Gen Z is “brat” at learning and breaking workplace misconceptions? No, I didn’t say Gen Z’s are brats. I said they’re “brat”—an adjective, not a noun, that refers to the Gen Z language going viral. It’s actually a cool adjective of endearment, not a derogatory term. But it’s an important descriptive about the contemporary workplace. It is predicted that Gen Z will make up close to 27% of the U.S. workforce by next year, and bring with them their own slang such as “brat,” “Yap” or “very demure.” Gen Z’s Terms Of Endearment Since communication between generations is more critical than ever, TollFreeForwarding.com has created a TikTok Slang Dictionary to bridge the generation gap and help older employees connect with younger colleagues and hopefully improve workplace communication. In case you’re having trouble understand your Gen Z colleagues, here are 10 of the most used phrases from the dictionary: Very Demure: A person or action that is seen as “not too much,” soft, cute, and mindful. Brat: Compliment towards a person or action emulating confident rebellion, playful defiance and boldness. Aura Points: A way to measure how cool someone is. Each action a person does can increase or decrease the points based on what friends or colleagues think. Slay: A compliment used to describe an excellent job or action. Rizz: Short for charisma. Exceedingly charming and can easily woo someone. Cap: A statement that is a lie. No cap means “I’m not lying.” Ate/Eats: A compliment used to describe an action done impressively. Bet: An expression used for affirming a statement or agreeing to something, a confirmation. Yap: To speak for a long time. A person who is chatty or talks nonsensical—a “yapper.” Ick: A characteristic of someone that is an immediate turnoff. “Naturally, it was a good bit of fun putting this together, but that doesn’t mean workplace communication isn’t an important topic for us all,” according to Jason O’Brien, COO of TollFreeForwarding.com. “It falls to all of us, from managers to employees, to make the effort to meet our colleagues halfway when it comes to communicating with each other. We all have value to add in the workplace, which means we need to be able to work together and communicate effectively, no matter our age differences.” MORE FOR YOU iPhone 16 Release: Apple Confirms Special Event, On A Surprise New Date ‘Exciting Updates’—New Details Of Donald Trump’s Mystery Crypto Project Spark Wild Bitcoin Rival Speculation Trump Signals He May Skip ABC News Debate After Bashing Network Gen Z Bringing ‘Brat’ Culture To The Workplace The learning experts at Udemy released new data this month, proclaiming that Gen Z is “Brat” at learning and breaking workplace misconceptions. Their data outlines Gen Zers’ perceptions of what matters at work, how ready they are for the workplace and how they feel about learning. The slang “Brat” is a complimentary term. According to some sources even Kamala Harris’s campaign is having a \"Brat 2024 summer.\" The “Brat” culture is about accepting imperfections and owning your authentic self, Alan Todd told me by email. Todd, vice president and general manager of Udemy business leadership academy, says their research, Gen Z at Work: Understanding the Next Generation, shows that Gen Z are bringing a “Brat” mindset to the workforce, challenging common stereotypes associated with their generation and remaining true to their values in both their career and learning journeys. The survey ran from April 1st to May 7th, 2024 and gathered results from 6,677 multi-generational global learners across 10 countries. Findings tell an interesting narrative about the “Brat” obsessed generation that’s counter to common perceptions. “For example, the so-called TikTok generation is often believed to lack the focus for sustained learning,” Todd explains. “But when asked what forms of learning they typically engage with and which, out of these, are their preferred learning methods, Gen Zers report their primary preferred method of learning is through full online courses (44%).” Todd points out that Gen Z are often depicted by other generations as “lazy” and “unmotivated.” In fact, my previous stories at Forbes.com also show that they are getting flak for their inability to collaborate and communicate, and hiring managers say Gen Z is the worst to work with and manage. Their desire for immediate feedback and flexible work environments often clashes with traditional practices, so they resort to leaning more on AI than their managers. According to HiBob, Gen Z is being “very demure” and mindful in how they move forward with the company. As they enter the workforce, they show they care more about their long-term plans than millennials, thinking about 401(k)s, skill development and a clear, structured growth plan when considering job offers. When all is said and done, perhaps Gen Z is simply demonstrating that they have a different way of approaching their careers—with clear and methodical direction. And who can argue with that? Todd agrees, noting that Udemy’s data also contradict previous negative stereotypes, showing that Gen Z operate outside of arbitrary expectations, invoking “Brat” by looking for ways to grow and up-skill in their careers without compromising their mental wellness. He adds that 65% of Gen Z are eager for professional development, placing a strong emphasis on mental health, with 42% wanting senior leadership to prioritize work-life balance policies and 38% advocating for employee well-being and mental health support. Other call outs in the data include: Gen Z prefers to be in person: Face-to-face meetings are the top preferred method of communication for nearly three in five (58%) Gen Z respondents. These findings are notable, given the perception that Gen Zers only like to communicate by text and shun direct face-to-face communication. Gen Z resists AI in learning: When respondents were asked how likely they were to use an online learning platform that offers an AI-driven personalized learning experience, the results showed Gen Z is less likely to do so (70%) than Gen X or Millenials. Microlearning drives the popularity of online learning: Nearly all Gen Z survey respondents (94%) dedicate at least an hour a week to learning, and half (50%) spend five hours or more per week learning. “In these ways, Gen Z is challenging perceived stereotypes,” Todd concludes. “Gen Z inspire a new, more human-centered approach to leading people. The intersection of ‘Brat’ culture and Gen Z’s values is changing company cultures in important, positive ways, as leaders find ways to celebrate each person’s unique skills to create stronger, more resilient teams.” Follow me on Twitter.

In a Sunday interview with NBC, Democratic pollster Cornell Belcher shut down PBS’s Amna Nawaz’s pleas for Harris to talk to journalists. “Interviews are where candidates face rigor and skepticism and questions about issues that they’re not raising on the campaign trail and in monologue,” Nawaz (rightly) explained. “It opens it up to a conversation in a way that’s good for voters and good for democracy.” But it’s not good for Democrats, Belcher shot back: “As a campaign hack, no. She should be talking to the voters and barnstorming the way they do . . . I don’t want her talking to you all right now.” Harris isn’t “talking to voters” as much as talking at them — from a teleprompter at rallies that insulate her from any risk of an actual interaction that could prove embarrassing. Belcher didn’t even have to explain why he doesn’t want the Democratic nominee sitting down for even gentle media questioning: Everyone knows she’d choke. Even a friendly reporter might be tempted to ask about her flip-flops on issues like fracking and health care — or for details on any of her policy ideas. She might get caught in a lie, like when she told Lester Holt she had visited the border, and he promptly called her out. Or take refuge in word-salad. Or dissolve into a fit of giggles. Democrats gain nothing from letting Harris “face rigor and skepticism and questions about issues,” and risk losing big-time: Harris’ track record in her 2019 prez run (which didn’t make it into 2020) shows that the more voters learn about her, the less they like her. All Dems want voters to know is that she’s not Donald Trump, she’s younger than Joe Biden and she’s four-square for truth, justice and the American way (plus abortion rights). As for face time with the press being “good for democracy” . . . well, maybe after Election Day. Fact is, Belcher was being too honest for a “campaign hack” in explaining things so clearly. And, indeed, way more honest than all the media figures running interference for Harris’ post-COVID update of Joe Biden’s 2020 basement strategy.","summary":"Democrats are now saying the quiet part out loud: They want Kamala Harris to keep hiding from the press.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/26/opinion/pollster-admits-the-obvious-dems-want-to-keep-kamala-harris-far-from-the-press/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/2024-democratic-presidential-candidate-kamala-88171193-e1724710011650.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-26 22:20:06","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.115},{"id":254980534,"title":"Why Trump, Harris campaigns are disputing over ABC debate mute button","text":"Why Trump, Harris campaigns are disputing over ABC debate mute button Former President Donald Trump's campaign is casting doubt on his ABC debate participation over a dispute with Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign on the use of a microphone mute button.

His criticism comes as the 538 model, which favored Biden even at his lowest point before dropping out of the race, is back and now favors Kamala Harris to defeat Trump with a 59% chance of Harris victory. The report LaCivita linked to notes that the 538 model was taken offline when Biden dropped out and appears to have been reworked since then, now appearing to more closely match other popular and respected election models. But ABC has not provided transparency into those changes and the reasons they were made. Semafor cites ABC sources who say that the 538 staff were prevented by ABC News and the network’s communications team “from discussing or disclosing many details about the changes publicly.” It also notes that there were internal disagreements at the network about how much to explain the changes, if at all. The famed 538 election prediction model, based largely on aggregating numerous polls, has long been under fire despite its above-average accuracy ever since it favored Hillary Clinton to beat Donald Trump in 2016. But since ABC News acquired the site and parted ways with founder Nate Silver, they’ve been running a new prediction model — which has caused headaches of its own, both inside and outside of ABC. “This is a suppression tool used by the media to drive a narrative they concoct ..then they ‘report’ on,” LaCivita asserted on X. “@ABC should disown it if they want to maintain any credibility.” The site’s founder himself, Silver, had criticized the 538 model before it was reworked, pointing to the fact that it seemed to overemphasize items seen as election fundamentals — such as the power of being an incumbent candidate — rather than the actual polls. It’s also been critcized by one of the other most prominent voices in polling, the New York Times’ chief political analyst Nate Cohn. A number of people have also noted that ABC has downplayed the once-central election prediction model, making it difficult to find on the ABC News website. The model itself isn’t currently linked to from the 538 homepage, beyond a link to an article about its methodology, while other charts showing information including an average of the polls and whether Democrats or Republicans are favored remain featured. The model was taken offline when Biden dropped out, but 538 public announced that they didn’t plan to put it back up online until the Democrats officially nominated a new candidate. Even when that quietly happened behind the scenes ahead of the Democratic National Convention, they still didn’t put the model back up online until the convention was over. Founder Silver has continued to criticize the site he founded, noting that he retained the rights to his election model, which he has made available on a subscription basis through his own site. While praising the 538 staff, he doesn’t think the site is being well served by its owners. “I imagine the folks still working for 538 would prefer more transparency too,” Silver wrote on X. “It’s an incredibly bad decision by Disney/ABC News and they deserve 100% of the criticism coming their way.” The Times’ Cohn explained some of the differences in the new model, while also calling for greater transparency from ABC. “If the model did change, it’s not obvious in the methodology article,” Cohn wrote Friday. “I think this model makes more sense, but the need for explanation and transparency is even greater after such a huge shift.” Cohn went on to note, “Nate Silver became famous bc his models were accurate, but his models were credible long before the election result because he explained the evidence and assumptions behind every step of his model. You can make a model that says just about anything. So the credibility of these models hinges entirely on whether the modeler provides a transparent, thorough and evidence-based description of the methods and findings. Without that, there’s nothing.” What exactly underlies the revised 538 remains to be revealed by ABC News. “The ABC folks are great, but I’m not sure whom this is helping,” Lakshya Jain of modeling tool Split Ticket wrote on X. “If they don’t believe in the model, then why publish it? Hiding the model hurts their revenue, does nothing to help repair the press damage, and simply kneecaps the 538 team.”","summary":"Chris LaCivita's comments come as the site faces widespread criticism over a lack of transparency into the presidential prediction tool\n\n\nThe post Trump Campaign Manager Accuses ABC&#8217;s 538 Election Model of Being a &#8216;Suppression Tool Used by the Media&#8217; appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/538-model-nate-silver-trump-chris-lacivita/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/CleanShot-2024-08-26-at-15.12.29@2x.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-26 22:17:58","author":"Mike Roe","authors":["Mike Roe"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.192},{"id":254980256,"title":"Biden-Harris push to memory-hole their deadly Afghan-bugout disaster","text":"On Monday, the third anniversary of the Abbey Gate bombing that killed 13 US service members amid President Biden’s Afghanistan debacle, former President Donald Trump visited Arlington National Cemetery for a private wreath-laying with families of the fallen. Doing their best to memory-hole one of their administration’s biggest failures, Biden and Veep Kamala Harris took the day off. Instead, the White House issued statements in both their names. The Biden one even listed all 13 names, though he’d forgotten the fallen’s existence during his July debate with Trump, when he proudly boasted that no American military had died in combat on his watch. And the president still calls the bugout a “success,” insisting he made no mistakes — though his top generals have testified under oath that he ignored their warnings about his withdrawal plan. Which is one reason many of the bereaved spoke at the Republican convention, where they noted how Trump has spent hours with them. The statement in Harris’ name overlapped heavily, word for word, with Biden’s (they came out of the same shop, after all), while adding some prayers-are-with-them and my-heart-breaks language. It also stands up for Joe: “President Biden made the courageous and right decision to end America’s longest war.” That neatly ignores at least two things: the pullout plan he overruled his generals to impose, and her proud boast at the time that she was “the last one in the room” when he made the decision. The disaster in Kabul stands as one of the worst legacies of the Biden-Harris administration, emboldening terrorists and dictators worldwide to believe the United States will cut-and-run when the going gets tough.

More than 200 Republican officials who once worked for former President George W. Bush, Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), and the late Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris for the presidency and warned of the dangers of a second Trump term in an open letter released Monday. The letter, first reported by USA Today, outlines both the foreign and domestic dangers of a second Trump term: “At home, another four years of Donald Trump’s chaotic leadership, this time focused on advancing the dangerous goals of Project 2025, will hurt real, everyday people and weaken our sacred institutions,” the group wrote. “Abroad, democratic movements will be irreparably jeopardized as Trump and his acolyte JD Vance kowtow to dictators like Vladimir Putin while turning their backs on our allies. We can’t let that happen.” The signatories range from former volunteers, interns, and assistants to onetime high-level officials in the White House and Senate, including Jean Becker, former chief of staff for 24 years to George H.W. Bush; Joe Donoghue, Senate stalwart and McCain’s former legislative director; and David Nierenberg, national finance chair for Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign. “Of course, we have plenty of honest, ideological disagreements with Vice President Harris and Gov. Walz. That’s to be expected,” they wrote. “The alternative, however, is simply untenable.” Steven Cheung, Trump’s spokesperson, said in a statement provided to Mother Jones: “It’s hilarious because nobody knows who these people are. They would rather see the country burn down than to see President Trump successfully return to the White House to Make America Great Again.” Romney already said earlier this year he would “absolutely not” vote for Trump, but he does not appear to have publicly said who he will vote for. The New York Times reported in 2020 that Bush would not be voting for Trump, citing “people familiar with [his] thinking”; Bush does not appear to have addressed the topic thus far for the upcoming election. Spokespeople for Bush and Romney did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Mother Jones. McCain withdrew his support for Trump in the 2016 election after the Access Hollywood tape leaked in which Trump bragged about committing sexual assault. The dissent within Republican ranks comes just days after several prominent Republicans—including some ex-Trump officials—sang Harris’ praises at the Democratic National Convention and urged conservatives to vote for her over Trump. On Friday, a dozen former White House lawyers who served under three Republican presidents—both Bushes and Ronald Reagan—also endorsed Harris over Trump, alleging that he would “threaten American democracy and undermine the rule of law in our country,” Fox News first reported. And as I reported earlier this month, the Harris campaign launched a group aimed at wooing Trump-skeptical voters to their ticket. A Harris-Walz campaign official pointed to these examples as proof of how the campaign has conducted outreach to moderate and independent voters. Trump, meanwhile, seems to have trouble garnering support from his former staff, let alone from people across the aisle. According to a report published in the Washington Post earlier this month, only about half of Trump’s former cabinet has openly endorsed his reelection bid.","summary":"The trend continues: Republicans are defecting from former President Donald Trump in droves.

Members of the Gold Star families participated in a call with GOP Vice Presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance, the Trump campaign and reporters Monday afternoon — three years after the attack. 'YOU'RE FIRED': TRUMP VOWS PINK SLIPS ON DAY 1 FOR EVERY OFFICIAL RESPONSIBLE FOR 'AFGHANISTAN CALAMITY' The suicide bombing by a member of ISIS-K at the Abbey Gate entrance of Hamid Karzai International Airport took the lives of 13 U.S. service members – 11 Marines, one Navy sailor and one Army soldier. Eighteen other U.S. service members were wounded. The bombing also left more than 150 civilians dead. Former President Trump held a wreath laying ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery Monday morning to commemorate and honor the 13 American servicemembers who were killed. But neither Biden nor Harris attended, or held any similar events on Monday to honor the fallen soliders. \"I think this administration has shown they have treated the Afghanistan withdrawal like the plague – they’ve stayed as far away from it as they possibly can,\" Gold Star father Mark Schmitz said in response to a question by Fox News Digital. \"I’m not surprised in the least bit that neither one of them would show up for this event.\" Schmitz told Fox News Digital that \"it is pretty obvious that when things get tough, they go running.\" \"This is yet another spit in the face to the 13 families,\" Schmitz told Fox News Digital. Schmitz added that Trump’s presence at the event \"was genuine.\" REPUBLICANS SLAM HARRIS FOR BEING 'LAST PERSON IN THE ROOM' WHEN BIDEN MADE CALL TO EVACUATE AFGHANISTAN \"I don’t see this as being part of his political campaign in any way, shape or form,\" Schmitz said. \"He has always vowed to be there for us—since we met with him early on—and he has never let us down.\" Schmitz lost his 20-year-old son, U.S. Marine Corps Lance Cpl. Jared Schmitz, that day. Gold Star Aunt Cheryl Juels, who attended the ceremony Monday at Arlington National Ceremony, said that \"it doesn’t matter\" what Biden or Harris say, adding \"it is not genuine.\" \"He has never once reached out to any of our families,\" Juels said, \"Kamala Harris has never once reached out. Kamala Harris supported [Biden] this entire time.\" Juels, the aunt of fallen Marine Corps Sgt. Nicole Ghee, told Fox News Digital that \"the only person who has reached out to our family over and over again and to all 13 families is Trump.\" \"Him coming out here today and honoring these kids who served, and spending the time talking to all of us and doing this ceremony and showing them honor and respect and dignity,\" Juels said. \"We need President Trump back in office.\" Juels said Trump \"is the only president president who kept our men and women safe who were serving this country. We 100% support him.\" \"We will do whatever we can to get him back into office so that we can keep the men and women serving this country safe again,\" Juels said. Fox News Digital had previously reported that the suicide bomber had been a prisoner released from Bagram Air Base on Aug. 15, 2021, after the Taliban seized control of the facility.

Fox News host Neil Cavuto pressed Kirby to see if he had ever been compelled to tell Biden he should clarify his comment.

On July 21, hours after President Joe Biden abandoned his reelection campaign and endorsed Harris as the Democratic Party nominee, the 32-year-old British pop star, real name Charlotte Emma Aitchison, shared her approval with a simple tweet: “kamala IS Brat.” The Harris campaign quickly capitalized on the singer’s blessing, sharing a screenshot of her post on TikTok. They also included a photo of their own version of Charli’s lime-green brat album cover. Addressing the viral phenomenon in a new interview with Vulture, the “Apple” artist admitted that she didn’t necessarily mean for her message to be construed as a political endorsement. She said she meant for it to be “something positive and lighthearted.” However, she acknowledged: “To be on the right side of democracy, the right side of women’s rights, is hugely important to me. I’m happy to help to prevent democracy from failing forever.” “I obviously knew what I was doing,” she quipped. “Did I think me talking about being a messy b**** and, like, partying and needing a Bic lighter and a pack of Marlboro Lights would end up on CNN? No.” “Brat” culture, which was popularized by Charli, has since made headlines, with several news programs, including CNN, and political pundits trying to decipher the meaning behind the Gen Z slang. The term “brat” is a noun and means an icon or an embrace of authenticity and confidence in oneself. Despite enlivening the 2024 presidential election among young voters, Charli clarified that she is not “a political artist.” “I’m not Bob Dylan, and I’ve never pretended to be,” she said. “My music is not political. Everything I do in my life feeds back into my art. Everything I say, wear, think, enjoy – it all funnels back into my art. Politics doesn’t feed my art.” Elsewhere in the long-ranging interview, Charli addressed the inspiration behind her song “Sympathy is a Knife”, which is widely believed to be about Taylor Swift. “People are gonna think what they want to think,” she said. “That song is about me and my feelings and my anxiety and the way my brain creates narratives and stories in my head when I feel insecure and how I don’t want to be in those situations physically when I feel self-doubt.” The two artists have recently been rivaling each other in the music charts after Swift released new UK-only editions of her latest album The Tortured Poets’ Department, prompting her to pip brat to the No 1 spot in the UK charts. Swift praised Charli’s “surreal and inventive” songwriting, telling the Vulture journalist: “I’ve been blown away by Charli’s melodic sensibilities since I first heard ‘Stay Away’ in 2011. “She just takes a song to places you wouldn’t expect it to go, and she’s been doing it consistently for over a decade. I love to see hard work like that pay off.”","summary":"The British pop star unintentionally helped Kamala Harris’s presidential campaign take off with Gen Z voters","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/charli-xcx-kamala-harris-brat-summer-b2602076.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/26/21/Untitled-design.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/I1lon9pq-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-26 22:04:27","author":"Inga Parkel","authors":["Inga Parkel"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.154},{"id":254980296,"title":"Megyn Kelly Slams Washington Post for Labeling Kamala Harris’ Husband a ‘Sex Symbol’ | Video","text":"Megyn Kelly slammed a Washington Post journalist for referring to Kamala Harris’ husband, Doug Emhoff, as a “sex symbol” in her latest piece, “Doug Emhoff, Modern-Day Sex Symbol.” “The media is absolutely disgusting,” Kelly said of The Post’s Catherine Rampell and her column, which was published Friday. In the story, Rampell outlines Emhoff’s background as a former corporate lawyer, his previous remarks uplifting feminism and how he’s the “modern female fantasy.” The piece tells longtime Hollywood heartthrobs like Ryan Gosling to “move over.” Watch Kelly’s full reaction video below: For Kelly, she felt this was Rampell’s way of trying to redeem herself with Democratic readers. “This is very interesting … She’s the one who wrote the piece ripping Kamala’s economic plan to shreds on the price gouging, saying this is ridiculous when they’re accusing you of being a communist, maybe don’t propose communism as your economic plan,” Kelly said. “[Rampell] got killed by her readers on the left about the current second gentleman, a man who may I remind you cheated on his first wife with the nanny whom he impregnated.” She continued: “They either aborted the child or he abandoned the child. Either way, no bueno.” Emhoff admitted to having an extramarital affair during his first marriage with Kerstin Emhoff. The two separated after the other woman, who has not been named, became pregnant. Emhoff reportedly shared that the pregnancy ended in a miscarriage. Per CBS, two sources close to the situation said the woman was a schoolteacher, not a nanny as Kelly stated. While Harris nor her campaign have presented Emhoff to be the people’s choice for “Most Debonair,” they have platformed Emhoff’s face on promotional materials like T-shirts. On Harris and Walz’s official store, clothing picturing a younger Emhoff have completely sold out. His T-shirts are part of the campaign’s “throwback” memorabilia. Additional items include images of Harris when she was in college, and the site even has an entire clothing section dedicated to Walz, titled “Coach’s Collection.” Watch the full breakdown on “The Megyn Kelly Show” in the video above.","summary":"The conservative media pundit dragged a Friday column that praised Doug Emhoff, calling out his past infidelity\n\n\nThe post Megyn Kelly Slams Washington Post for Labeling Kamala Harris&#8217; Husband a &#8216;Sex Symbol&#8217; | Video appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/megyn-kelly-doug-emhoff-kamala-harris-washington-post/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Megyn-Kelly-and-Doug-Emhoff.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-26 22:02:41","author":"Raquel 'rocky' Harris","authors":["Raquel 'rocky' Harris"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.175}]}
