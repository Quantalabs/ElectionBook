That went double when I saw a recent survey by the Public Religion Research Institute. \n\nIt asked people if they agreed that Donald Trump is “a dangerous dictator whose power should be limited before he destroys American democracy.” Fifty-two percent said yes, including 56 percent of swing voters. That, according toAxios, suggests “that middle-of-the-road voters who helped put him back in office are abandoning him.”\n\nYou might say, what’s the problem, John? Things are looking up.\n\nAre they? Look closer. Fifty-eight percent of Asian-American and Pacific Islander respondents agreed. Sixty-three percent of Latino respondents agreed. Sixty-seven percent of Black respondents agreed.\n\nBut what about the biggest demographic of them all?\n\nOnly 45 percent of white respondents agreed. \n\nDespite all the destruction, and destruction to come – and despite the president’s defiance of a US Supreme Court ruling to bring back Kilmar Abrego Garcia after his illegal deportation to El Salvador – a majority of white Americans, 55 percent, are like dictator? What dictator?\n\nMajorities of the other racial demographics see what needs seeing. Why doesn’t the biggest one? The answer is obvious. At least, it should be. So my question is: How can American democracy endure?\n\nHope is what I found myself lacking in the conversation below. It began with kind criticism of a piece I wrote in which I asked what the reaction would be if Kamala Harris had done with tariffs what Trump has done. But the conversation with someone who wanted only to be known by her Bluesky handle, The Angry Black Woman, took a turn.\n\n“That concept of ‘hope’ sits with the white community,” The Angry Black Woman told me, “and I know they will blow up the world before they admit they were wrong or actually try to save our country.”\n\nJS: In a recent piece, I asked readers to ask themselves what the reaction would be if Harris did what Trump is doing with tariffs? You said such comparisons do more harm than good. Can you explain?\n\nTABW: I believe it is incredibly harmful and here's why. One, anytime you compare a Black person to a white one, you are bringing in biases, prejudice and close-minded opinions. Two, we know how Black figures have to be five times better than white counterparts to get half as far, so it always seems like it's either clickbait or lazy to use such a headline. Three, Black people are generally very pragmatic. We want better for our families and communities, and we consciously work toward solutions that will be better to everyone, not just ourselves.\n\nSo when we compare the heinous acts of a white person and hold up a Black person as a litmus, it confirms bias or prejudice one may have while never looking at actual policies creating harm. Your article asked if it was a Democrat doing this. I felt like you could have stayed on that path. You could have replaced Harris with Biden and still made the point. Biden is an old white man who had polarizing views (equality and whatnot) and that would have been a proper comparison. By using Harris, it clouds the initial viewpoint with racism and misogyny, which are additional barriers that the current occupant doesn't face.\n\nSo these comparisons hurt the Black community, because people don't think we belong in these spaces. And while they may champion Black people when they need to be saved, this past election showed us that, even when faced with certain doom, white people will never truly stand behind a Black person for power. Especially a Black woman.\n\nJS: I have run into this before. My intention is to use Harris as any kind of Democrat, but the reaction is sometimes no, she's not just any kind of Democrat -- that I'm not paying enough attention to the context and history, especially re Black women. This is probably a blind spot of mine.\n\nTABW: I would agree, but I also don't think you are doing that for nefarious reasons. I think it's hard for a white male journalist to fully appreciate the nuances of the Black experience. I think it's even harder for you to see the perspective of Black women. I have been reading your work for a while (back in those Twitter streets) and I believe you are fair and try to do it right. But it's true, when speaking about Harris, it's not just a red versus blue conversation. As a Black woman, I know firsthand the struggle she endured, that we all endure. So when we try to minimize or dismiss that in its full context, people get upset.\n\nJS: You have given me a rare chance to ask: Is there concern among your peers about the Democratic Party moving away from its current base? Sanders is again getting a lot of attention for his criticism of \"identity politics.\" Even mainstream Dems like Chris Murphy say his shtick is good for bringing Trump voters back to the Democrats. What do you think?\n\nTABW: I think that if you bank on white people saving democracy, you should just say goodbye to it now. They aren't built that way. While I understood why Harris reached out the way she did, I knew that it was pointless. White people will choose destruction over equality every single time. So if that is where the Democrats want to go, good for them. It doesn't mean we won't vote, if we still can, but that energy that is the base of the party won't be there. Those white voters are never going to come back and, if they do, they won't be loyal. So this is just another way that America is showing how little they value us.\n\nAs an overseas voter, my ability to cast another vote may be gone soon. That is going to impact the Democratic Party. It's just another way that the party is devouring itself. After November, I don't even care anymore, to be honest. I live in Europe and have seen what happens when racism rolls in. There are countries here that have been fighting for decades to get their freedom back, and it's still not on the horizon.\n\nJS: There is this belief among liberals (white liberals) that Trump voters will turn on him if they experience enough suffering at his hands. An example is Medicaid. The Republicans in the Congress are trying to take it away to pay for tax cuts for the richest. Do that, critics say, and Trump's voters will give Democrats a second look. I do not buy this. It's like they can't believe why they voted for Trump in the first place.\n\nTABW: They won't turn on him. They knew what they were getting and still made that choice. They knew the risks, but it was more important to be white. More importantly, I believe other forces were in play and the truth is, they will never be able to vote him, or any Rethuglikkkan out of office. Look at Hungary and Russia. Same went down there. We tried to tell people. They wouldn't listen. Here we are. The only difference is Black people aren't new to this. We will always survive.\n\nJS: Given all this, where do you put yours these days?\n\nTABW: Honestly?\n\nJS: Always.","summary":"Some days, I wonder how democracy can endure.

Ruben Gallego spoke at a Pennsylvania town hall Saturday during which he, to the disappointment of many attendees, failed to bring up the name of his embattled colleague, Pennsylvania Democratic Sen. John Fetterman.\n\nFetterman has made a series of headlines after a May 2 New York Magazine article suggested that the maverick first-term lawmaker was in poor mental and physical health, prompting his fellow Senate Democrats to reportedly discuss both ways to help him and potential replacements for him in the event he were to resign. A recently-released Pittsburgh poll conducted in February pointed to western Pennsylvania Democrats’ disapproval of Fetterman — which also held true throughout the rural Bucks County town hall on the other side of the state. (RELATED: Fetterman’s Support Tanking Among His Fellow Democrats, Poll Shows)\n\n“I don’t like him and I hate that I voted for him,” one Gen Z voter, who claimed to have knocked doors for former Vice President Kamala Harris’ 2024 presidential campaign, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “Fetterman is the only person that I [voted for] that I’m like, ‘Fuck you.'”\n\nIn classic town hall fashion, voters lined up behind the microphone to ask Gallego questions after his speech.\n\nKyle, a Pennsylvania voter who identified as a lifelong progressive, praised the senator for initially running to challenge former Democratic-turned-independent Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema — a centrist lawmaker who often pushed back against Democrats on certain votes — and compared Sinema’s Senate tenure to Fetterman’s.\n\nAt the mention of Fetterman’s name, collective groans and quiet agreements filled the auditorium.\n\n“Glad to hear people agree,” Kyle said before asking Gallego what he would do differently in comparison to Fetterman. The voter implied that Fetterman’s January visit to President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence mirrored Gallego’s meeting with pro-Trump billionaire Marc Andreessen the following month.\n\nGallego claimed that the purpose of his visit with Andreessen, a longtime Democratic donor who endorsed Trump in 2024, was to bring more jobs to Arizona. The senator appeared to not answer the question of how he would be different from Fetterman.\n\n Gallego asked about meeting with Marc Andreessen and supporting the Trump-backed Laken Riley Act. “We’ll start with my general view of how to win elections is you have to get a lot of votes … and that means we’re going to have to have alliances with people that we may not agree… — Adam Pack (@packreports) May 10, 2025 \n\nVoters frequently pointed to Fetterman’s apparent move to the center as an issue, recalling how differently he presented himself at the beginning of his Senate term compared today.\n\n“I remember it was the American flag in rainbow and the stars were the weed flowers. I’m like, if that’s not the most liberal shit I’ve ever seen,” the door knocker told the DCNF, likely referring to flags Fetterman flew outside his office in 2021, while serving as Pennsylvania’s lieutenant governor. “I was like, ‘I love this guy!’ But then you might as just hang a Nazi flag at this point cause you’re guilty by association.”\n\nAnother male attendee was upset Fetterman was not focusing on the economic issues impacting people in his state, pointing to him as the “biggest issue” for Pennsylvania’s representation in Washington.\n\n“I think Fetterman is the biggest issue. He’s not acting like the way he was on the campaign trail,” the attendee told the DCNF. “I think he’s changed viewpoints on Israel and is less focused on other stuff like economic issues. I think he’s going to face a primary challenge. I just don’t know who it’s gonna be.”\n\nOne woman told the DCNF she was angry Fetterman and nine other Democrats in March “chose not to” close the federal government in resistance to the Trump administration’s agenda.\n\n“I was pissed off … We could have closed the federal government and he chose not to. They had the power,” the woman said.\n\nAnother attendee vehemently agreed, saying, “I think we should have shut down the government, because that would have been our first big ‘We’re not fucking around.'”\n\nThe desire among some Democratic voters to close the government is not just in opposition to Fetterman, but also Democratic Minority Leader Sen. Chuck Schumer who gathered a total of ten Democratic votes, including Fetterman’s, to pass a continuing resolution and avoid a shutdown.\n\nFetterman’s position on war in Gaza as well as his co-sponsorship of the Laken Riley Act, a bipartisan immigration law which Gallego also co-sponsored, sparked dissent among the town hall’s attendees, but they still held some concern for him amid the negative reports of his health.\n\nFetterman had a stroke during his successful campaign for the Senate in 2022. The following year, he received treatment for clinical depression.\n\n“I’m totally disappointed in Fetterman. I thought he’s lost his freaking mind,” a woman told the DCNF. “It sounds like he might have some cognitive stuff, which I can see that could be true.”\n\nAs the situation surrounding the senator has grown, more Democrats have shared their thoughts with reporters, sparking concerns that New York Magazine’s story is in fact not a “one-source hit piece,” as Fetterman has maintained. The Hill published an article Monday citing three anonymous Democratic Senators who shared how worried they are for Fetterman.\n\n“I know we’re all in touch with each other having conversations about how to intervene. I haven’t heard anybody say they’re not worried about it,” one senator told the outlet regarding the discussions being had about how to help Fetterman.\n\nAnother Democratic senator told The Hill, “Every time I see him, I’m worried about him.”\n\nIn addition to taking stances on immigration and foreign policy at odds with much of his party, Fetterman was notably the only member of the Senate Democratic Caucus to vote to confirm Trump administration Attorney General Pam Bondi in January.\n\nHowever, Gallego still expressed support for his Pennsylvania colleague’s continued membership in the party in a Saturday interview from Pennsylvania, conducted separately from the town hall.\n\n“There needs to be space for Fetterman and for other senators in our caucus,” Gallego said in the interview as first reported by Politico. “He still is a senator that fights for working-class people. We may not be 100 percent in agreement a lot of times in a lot of areas, but we don’t have to be.”\n\nIn the same interview, Gallego was also asked if the GOP is trying to convince Fetterman to switch parties.\n\n“Of course,” the Arizona senator answered. He dismissed the purported attempts to get his Pennsylvania colleague to become a Republican as “fuck-fuck games,” a term he attributed to his time in the U.S. Marine Corps.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Tim Walz.\n\n In his first-ever interview, which aired on CBS Mornings on Monday, May 12, Gus, 18, said he blocked out the hate and \"ignored\" the online attacks after his DNC moment went viral, explaining, \"I just continued to do what I do.\"\n\n Still, he told CBS Mornings, \"there’s nothing wrong with showing emotions. And if people are going to say there’s something wrong with that, then those are not the people I want to be associated with.\"\n\n While watching his dad accept the nomination for vice president at the DNC in August 2024, Gus sat tearfully in the audience with his mom, Gwen, and his sister, Hope. At one point, Gus applauded and pointed to the stage, saying, \"That's my dad!\"\n\n After the governor called his family his \"entire world,\" Gus stood up, crying as he gave his dad a round of applause. In the days after the moment aired on television, far-right figures like Ann Coulter and conservative Wisconsin radio host Jay Weber criticized Gus on X, with Coulter writing in a since deleted post, “Talk about weird …\" and Weber calling Gus' response \"embarrassing.\"\n\n When asked by CBS Mornings what he remembered from that night at the DNC, Gus said it was \"crazy\" to see so many people chanting his last name in support of his father.\n\n \"It’s super overwhelming cause for me, he’s just regular old dad. Just normal dad,\" Gus said. \"Golfs with me, make food, clean the cars — everything like that. And in the moment, it was something bigger. It was just surreal.\"\n\n Gus has ADHD, an anxiety disorder and a non-verbal learning disorder. Gwen, who also participated in the interview, told CBS Mornings that this means Gus sometimes struggles with \"reading facial cues, or understanding vocal tone or understanding gestures\" — but it does not mean that he cannot speak.\n\n While Gus said some people may think he's \"a little slow\" and \"not a normal kid,\" he told CBS Mornings he's \"one of the most normal people you could find,\" and enjoys playing volleyball, spending time with his friends and family and helping others.\n\n He also told CBS Mornings that his disability gives him \"some big strengths,\" including a knack for forming relationships.\n\n Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\n In a statement shared with PEOPLE in August 2024, Tim and Gwen called Gus' disability his \"secret power,\" and said their son \"is brilliant, hyper-aware of details that many of us pass by, and above all else, he’s an excellent son and brother to his sibling.\"\n\n Shortly after his DNC speech and the cruel comments about Gus that followed, Tim said in a joint CNN interview with Kamala Harris that he wanted to \"protect\" his children from public scrutiny, but said he was \"proud\" of Gus for his reaction that night.\n\n \"It was just such a visceral, emotional moment that I'm just ... I'm grateful I got to experience it,\" he said at the time.","summary":"The 18-year-old son of Tim Walz was met with both compassion and mockery when he was seen crying over his dad's vice presidential nomination","url":"https://people.com/gus-walz-responds-critics-viral-dnc-moment-first-ever-interview-11732924","image":"https://people.com/thmb/JT90b0fdG_h6LuVniHbtkrb42LY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(742x447:744x449)/Tim-Walz-Gwen-Walz-son-Gus-Walz-interview-051225-tout-128b4fc4a07f4ae58c9e800be0b1f2eb.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-12 17:34:08","author":"Greta Bjornson","authors":["Greta Bjornson"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.324},{"id":320562732,"title":"In Pittsburgh, candidates face their future voters, part of a national effort to engage the young","text":"By GARY FIELDS and AYANNA ALEXANDER\n\nPITTSBURGH (AP) — At Perry Traditional Academy, students took time out from classes on a recent Thursday to listen quietly in the school auditorium while a small group of their classmates questioned the four candidates running in Pittsburgh’s upcoming mayoral primary.\n\nThe topics covered an array of issues important to the teens: policing, school funding and youth involvement in their administrations.\n\nThe forum, coordinated by the Allegheny Youth Vote Coalition working with Pittsburgh Public Schools, was the eighth held at a public high school in the city, all designed to get the youngest and future voters involved in elections.

The US president’s remarks came as the first flight of white South African “refugees” were set to imminently disembark at Dulles airport.\n\n“It's a genocide that's taking place that you people don't want to write about,” said Trump. “It's a terrible thing that's taking place. And farmers are being killed. They happen to be white, but whether they're white or Black makes no difference to me, but white farmers are being brutally killed, and their land is being confiscated in South Africa.”\n\nViolence against white farmers is not particularly widespread even by the admission of organizations led by Afrikaaners dedicated to tracking farm attacks in South Africa, which suffers from a high rate of violent crime in general. White farmers own about 70 percent of commercial farmland in the country, despite making up a minority of the population. Fewer than 150 attacks involving farmers occurred during the entirety of 2023, according to the Afrikaaner political group AfriForum.\n\nNumerous news reports and studies have found that despite a recent law being passed allowing the government to seize land in some cases without compensation, those land seizures have not actually taken place. AfriForum has vowed a legal fight in the country’s court system if that program were to begin, but even advocates for Afrikaaners have tempered their allegations and rhetoric beyond what the US president displayed on Monday.\n\nTrump would insist on Monday that US media would cover the situation in South Africa more were the racial demographics reversed and a white majority was allegedly persecuting a Black minority.\n\n“If it were the other way around, they'd talk about it. That would be the only story they'd talk about,” he said.\n\nA spokesman for South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, said that the US was undermining South Africa’s sovereignty and perpetrating a false narrative, but said that the government would not hinder the departures of white South Africans who wished to leave for America.\n\n\"These people won't be stopped from going, albeit under a false narrative,\" Vincent Magwenya told NPR. \"There's no legal or any factual basis for the executive order sanctioning this action. None of the provisions of international law on the definition of refugees are applicable in this case.\"\n\n\"Disturbingly, one has to admit that our sovereignty as a country is being grossly undermined and violated by the United States,\" he added.\n\nThe Trump administration’s acceptance and even encouragement of migration from South Africa stands in stark contrast to the administration’s efforts to fast-track the asylum process and expel as many as one million undocumented immigrants during the president’s first year in office. \n\nThe president signed an executive order addressing the supposed “genocide” in February after the passage of that new law expanding the government’s power to seize land.\n\n“The United States cannot support the government of South Africa’s commission of rights violations in its country or its undermining United States foreign policy, which poses national security threats to our Nation, our allies, our African partners, and our interests,” read the order, which also cited the South African goverment’s support for allegations of Israeli-led genocide in Gaza at the International Court of Justice.\n\nStephen Miller, the architect of that program, told reporters on Friday: “What’s happening in South Africa fits the textbook definition of why the refugee program was created. This is persecution based on a protected characteristic, in this case, race.”\n\nMiller and Trump’s decision to lean in to a conspiracy theory about “white genocide” has been seen by many as a dogwhistle to the American extreme right, which under Trump’s first term in office coordinated a mass rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, where racist and antisemitic rhetoric and groups were on full display. During the 2024 campaign, Trump himself was accused of spreading racist conspiracy theories after he accused Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, of eating stray household pets, including during a debate with Kamala Harris.\n\nA total of 49 white South Africaners arrived Monday as part of the first group admitted under the Trump administration’s refugee program.

Many Democrats, including former Vice President Kamala Harris, have also sounded the alarm on outrageously high drug prices in the country and have offered plans to combat them. \n\nKirk, a staunch supporter of Trump, touted the president’s announcement to lower drug prices despite previously railing against Harris’s plan to do the same thing.\n\n“Just a few hours after teasing his most important Truth Social Post ever, President Trump announced that he’ll be signing an EO Monday morning to lower the cost of prescription drugs 30-80%. Big Pharma’s lobbying of Washington DC has long allowed them to price gouge Americans. No more,” Kirk wrote on social media platform X.\n\nHowever, he was immediately roasted for pushing back on “price controls” when Harris suggested it.\n\n“This you?” Project Liberal wrote on X, attaching a screenshot of Kirk’s previous tweet.\n\nThe previous tweet said: “Price controls are Communism 101 but they ‘sound good’ to the economic illiterate.”\n\nWhen Harris pitched a plan against price gouging in August, Kirk wrote:\n\n“ … they either don’t grasp basic economics and are incompetent, or they DO grasp basic economics, but are willing to wreck the economy to win political power. Kamala Harris along with Joe Biden created and enflamed inflation, and now they say they can ‘fix it’ by destroying the free market principles which made America the economic powerhouse it is,\" he wrote on X.\n\nThe new order calls on the health department, led by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., to broker new price tags for drugs. If a deal is not reached, a new rule will kick in that will tie the price of what the U.S. pays for medications to lower prices paid by other countries. \n\n“We’re going to equalize,” Trump said during a Monday morning press conference. “We’re all going to pay the same. We’re going to pay what Europe pays.” \n\nIt’s unclear what — if any — impact the Republican president’s executive order will have on millions of Americans who have private health insurance. The federal government has the most power to shape the price it pays for drugs covered by Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nThe federal government spends hundreds of billions of dollars on prescription drugs, injectables, transfusions and other medications every year through Medicare, which covers nearly 70 million older Americans. Medicaid, meanwhile, covers nearly 80 million poor and disabled people in the U.S.\n\nAhead of the signing, the nation’s leading pharmaceutical lobby on Sunday pushed back against Trump’s plan, calling it a “bad deal” for American patients. Drugmakers have long argued that any threats to their profits could impact the research they do to develop new drugs. \n\n“Importing foreign prices will cut billions of dollars from Medicare with no guarantee that it helps patients or improves their access to medicines,” Stephen J. Ubl, the president and CEO of PhRMA, said in a statement. “It jeopardizes the hundreds of billions our member companies are planning to invest in America, making us more reliant on China for innovative medicines.”\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nOur journalism needs your support.

Now she accompanies her husband, and is often under scrutiny from the media and photographers taking shots of her attire.\n\nEvery article of clothes she has worn has also been closely examined and scrutinized. Did Melania have a message in mind? Was that shirt or suit meant as a jab at someone? She wore that, but why? There have been other instances where Melania’s attire has conveyed a tale, aside from the now-famous “I really don’t care do u?” jacket that allegedly led to significant conflict with Donald and a flurry of “guess the meaning” debate.\n\nConservative, although a little bit liberal\n\nOUR FIRST FAMILY!

Barron, who was tall and unrecognizable from Donald’s last victory speech eight years prior, was also present. Melania? Both of the Trump men wore black suits to the event in West Palm Beach, Florida. Not the glam version of herself.\n\nAs far as her style goes, she has been seen wearing leather leggings, bright colors, capes, and oversized hats. She wore a double-breasted blazer in a dark grey material and a long skirt that shin-brushed, presenting her with an office-matron professional appearance. She only wore her wedding ring and nothing else, including flashy necklaces, and her nails were all the same color.\n\nThere were two clear impressions from the ultra-conservative style. The first was that she wanted to blend in with her neutral color scheme and avoid drawing attention to herself. Second, she wanted people to take her seriously if they did notice her.\n\nMelania adopts a classic look to give the impression that she is a legend\n\n🚨2016 the fashion industry blacklisted Melania Trump – but she OWNED them walking out best dressed since Jackie Kennedy\nFast forward to 2025, EVERY major fashion house has asked to dress her Inauguration Day, but Melania said🖕by sticking with whose been loyal\nI’m so ready🍿 pic.twitter.com/csNbS7SbQ9\n— FoxyFarmer🦊🇺🇸 (@GardensR4Health) January 17, 2025\n\nYour husband is sworn in as President of the United States in Washington, D.C., twice in a lifetime at most, and it doesn’t happen every day. Melania Trump was dressed to the nines as Donald Trump first assumed the title on January 20, 2017.\n\nShe opted for a throwback style and powder-blue from head to toe for her ceremonial-free first lady inauguration. She wore matching gloves underneath the 3/4-sleeved dress, which had a structured neckline and a bolero-style overlay that matched her figure. The color pattern was completed with a basic pair of blue pumps.\n\nIt’s possible that Melania chose this specific outfit to evoke the memories of two distinct fashion icons that the American public has long loved. Her attire has been compared to that of former First Lady Jackie Kennedy. Additionally, we can’t help but believe that she is stealing from Audrey Hepburn’s wardrobe.\n\nShe swears by the bow\n\nFurthermore, here’s Melania in a $1,100.00 blouse pic.twitter.com/lY4bvZuB9f\n— Mrs. Fairfax🪷🇺🇦 (@AlisonDeLuca) September 12, 2024\n\nA video of Donald Trump speaking to “Access Hollywood” anchor Billy Bush from a ten-year-old interview leaked on October 7, 2016, during the height of his presidential campaign. Donald made crude comments about women while he was unaware that he was being filmed, claiming that he would uninvitedly grab them in their kitty-cat area (we’re cleaning it up; he used the “p” word). He and Melania Trump traveled to St. Louis, Missouri, two days later for a scheduled town hall debate.\n\nMelania wore bright pink, monochrome clothing. She was dressed in a top with a button in the back and slim-fitting jeans. A pink ribbon knotted in a large bow emphasized the shirt’s high neckline at the front. Everyone was drawn to that bow, which gave it a great deal of significance.\n\nPortraits of famous Gibson girls of the late 19th century usually depicted them with bows tied around their necks. The ribbons were referred to as pussycat bows, or pussy bows, because people used to think that they resembled the bows which individuals tied around their cats. They later became a staple of fashion, donned by powerful women such as Kamala Harris and Princess Diana.\n\nOthers thought Melania was sending a message regarding Donald’s infamous “Access Hollywood leaked tape scandal” and mocking her husband when she showed up to the debate wearing a pussy bow.\n\nDesigners don’t like Melania.\n\nMelania Trump tonight 2/28/17 #PresidentialAddress #AdressToCongress #JointAddress #PowerOfTheFirstLady pic.twitter.com/0EzwwLNUod\n— FLOTUS Report (@MELANIAJTRUMP) March 1, 2017\n\nMelania Trump went to a joint session of Congress on February 28, 2017, to witness her husband, Donald Trump, deliver his first address to the legislature as US president. Melania wore a black Michael Kors suit, which perhaps made her a little too suited up for the historic event. It cost about $10,000 and was adorned with a wide leather belt and dazzling beads.\n\nIts origin was more important than the actual ensemble, which consisted of a skirt and jacket. Designer Michael Kors himself commented on the suit after photos surfaced online, stating that Melania had frequented his New York boutique. This was his way of quietly stating that he did not create the ensemble for her, give it to her, or have any relationship to her.\n\nMany designers agree with Kors that they don’t want to link their company to the Trump surname. Since creating Melania’s 2017 inauguration ball gown, Herve Pierre has assisted with her wardrobe. He told Women’s Wear Daily that he shopped for the first lady off the rack rather than dealing directly with designers, and even then, he didn’t always disclose who he was buying for. “The fashion industry is not very welcoming [of Trump],” he said. “That’s no secret.”","summary":"The FLOTUS is a fashion icon for sure, but it's more than shiny shoes and polished couture, her style is more than often a statement","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/melanias-secret-messages-the-hidden-meaning-behind-her-most-controversial-outfits","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/The-Hidden-Meaning-Behind-Melanias-Most-Controversial-Outfits.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-12 11:59:41","author":"Shrobana Rakshit","authors":["Shrobana Rakshit"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.039},{"id":320453602,"title":"Candidates Connect with Future Voters in Pittsburgh as Part of Nationwide Youth Engagement Initiative","text":"PITTSBURGH – At Perry Traditional Academy, students paused their regular classes on a recent Thursday to attentively listen in the school auditorium. A select group of students took the opportunity to question the four candidates vying in Pittsburgh’s upcoming mayoral primary.\n\nThe topics covered an array of issues important to the teens: policing, school funding and youth involvement in their administrations.\n\nThis event, organized by the Allegheny Youth Vote Coalition in collaboration with Pittsburgh Public Schools, marked the eighth gathering of its kind at a city public high school. The goal of these forums is to engage the youngest and future voters in the electoral process. After the candidates departed, students participated in a brief oral civics test about elections, with prizes awarded for correct responses.\n\nWhat’s happening in Pittsburgh and surrounding Allegheny County is part of a national trend.\n\nYounger voters traditionally have participated in elections at lower rates compared to older generations. Civic organizations aim to change this trend by engaging teenagers in public discussions before they reach voting age, recognizing its importance for the future of democracy in the U.S.\n\nA Pew Research Center analysis found that voters under the age of 30 made up 15% of voters in the 2020 election and 27% of nonvoters, a slight improvement in both categories over 2016, when that demographic was 13% of all voters and 33% of nonvoters. Voters were also much older than nonvoters, on average, in the 2018 and 2022 midterm elections, according to Pew.\n\nAllowing teens to have a voice in local elections\n\nAmong the groups leading the effort nationally is the Civics Center, which works with high schoolers to run voter registration drives and hold forums that are geared toward raising their participation in elections. Others, such as The Gem Project Inc., in Newark, New Jersey, have pushed for students to be able to register and cast ballots in local elections before they turn 18.\n\nLast year, the Newark City Council dropped the minimum voting age to 16 for school board elections, making it the first municipality in the state and the second largest city in the country to do so for any election. Oakland was the largest city in the U.S. to lower its voting age in 2020, but teens voted for the first time last year. \n\nBreanna Quist, 18, and one of the recent registrants in Newark, said the push was especially important to her because it allowed students to vote for an office, school board, that directly affects them.\n\n“This just shows how young people should always just take action. They shouldn’t be fearful. They should always advocate for what they believe is right,” she said during an interview at a voter registration town hall earlier this year.\n\nNishani Ward, 16, said it was an inspiration when Newark lowered the voting age for local elections.\n\n“Doing this right now, I’m more likely to do it in the future and do it more routinely in the future,” she said.\n\nMedia reports said turnout among 16- and 17-year-old registered voters in the April school board election was less than 4% but outpaced the overall turnout.\n\nHelping young people learn their role in democracy\n\nIn some places across the country, young people have had success when demanding a greater voice in political decisions. They’ve argued that voting adults don’t always consider them or their needs when casting their ballots. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 21 states and the District of Columbia allow 17-year-olds who will turn 18 by the time of a general election to vote in primaries.\n\nEven though the youth vote tends to bend left politically, this might be a good time to reconsider the minimum age because it’s become less predictable, said Daniel Hart, a professor of psychology at Rutgers University who has studied lowering the voting age.\n\nData from AP VoteCast, a survey of interviews with registered voters in all 50 states, found that Democrat Kamala Harris had a slight edge over Republican Donald Trump among young voters, but young men swung to the right for Trump even if they didn’t agree with him on all issues.\n\nThe Allegheny Youth Vote Coalition held two vote huddles in 2024, drawing students from throughout the county. They learned about the electoral process and held more than 20 voter registration drives, said Rachel Martin Golman, senior director of social impact of the National Council of Jewish Women Pittsburgh and a coalition member.\n\nDuring a workshop earlier this year, one student attendee asked why the candidates didn’t come speak to them, Golman said: ”And we all thought, yes, why not, and worked to make it happen.”\n\nLaura Brill, the founder and CEO of the Civics Center, a Los Angeles-based coalition member, said the point is that “most teens today have few opportunities to consider their important role in our democracy.” She said engaging the candidates directly is “the kind of formative experience we believe has been missing from high schools for decades and has undoubtedly led to the low rates of engagement we see among the up-and-coming voters.”\n\n‘You are the future’\n\nAt Perry, the students in the audience didn’t shy away from asking questions important to them and their peers.\n\nMakaila Nyambe, 17, asked each mayoral candidate about funding for schools, while fellow junior Deahmi Mobley questioned how they might establish a good relationship between law enforcement and teens. Previous forums at other schools included questions on other issues, including how each candidate would implement diversity, equity and inclusion into their administrations.\n\nTrash, homelessness and public safety came up constantly, along with a disagreement over whether more school spending would improve academic performance. Infrastructure, road repairs and cuts to public transit also generated discussion.\n\nThe students listened closely when all four candidates talked about neighborhood policing and building relationships — and about the importance of young people at such a forum.\n\n “You are the leaders we have been waiting for,” said one of the mayoral candidates, retired Pittsburgh police detective Tony Moreno.\n\n“You are the future of Pittsburgh,” said another candidate, Thomas West, a business owner and former television news producer. “You are the future of America.”\n\nStalea Chapman, a 17-year-old senior, said afterward she was glad the candidates were taking the students seriously and reaching out to them because their futures are intertwined with politics and policies, especially now.\n\n“It is a lot of pressure being young and seeing what the economy is turning to and what’s going on in the world,” she said. “It’s frightening for young people because we want to be successful.” \n\nAlexander reported from Newark, New Jersey.

Angie Craig’s seat is heating up and expected to sizzle ","text":"WASHINGTON – The race for U.S. Rep. Angie Craig’s 2nd District seat is in its early stages and has so far attracted just two candidates, both DFLers named Matt. But the contest to represent Minnesota’s swingiest district in Congress is once again expected to be fiercely competitive and very expensive.\n\nCraig’s decision to run for retiring U.S. Sen. Tina Smith’s seat prompted the Cook Political Report to change its rating of the 2nd District seat from “safe Democrat” to “likely Democrat,” which makes the race more competitive for the GOP.\n\nErin Covey of the Cook Political Report said the 2nd District race was downgraded a bit for Democrats because an open seat, by definition, is more competitive than one held by an incumbent. She said Democrats will continue to have a strong advantage.\n\nBut others think Craig’s decision to run for the Senate gives Republicans a chance to do what they haven’t been able to do for years – claim the 2nd District for the GOP.\n\n“I think it’s going to be a very close general election,” said Hamline University political science professor David Schultz.\n\nThe district encompasses the Twin Cities suburbs and the southern portion of Washington County as well as the rural areas of Dakota and Scott Counties, Le Sueur County and much of Rice County.\n\nSince the district was created in 1861, its voters have elected both Democrats and Republicans to represent them. Yet, historically, they have favored the GOP and that party held the seat for 18 years before Craig was elected in 2019.\n\nBut redistricting and the rapid growth of the Twin Cities suburbs and exurbs have shifted the race towards the Democratic Party. In 2016, Donald Trump won the district narrowly over Hillary Clinton but lost it to Kamala Harris — who won 51.6% of the vote — last year.\n\n“This district has been trending to the left since 2016,” Covey said.\n\nFred Slocum, a political science professor at Minnesota State University, Mankato, said that while the district includes rural areas that likely will favor a Republican candidate, it also includes suburban areas.\n\n“And, in general, in the Twin Cities suburbs, the DFL has gained ground over the past 10 to 20 years as a number of suburbs, previously heavily white, have become more diverse with greater shares of racial and ethnic minorities,” Slocum said.\n\nHe also said the 2022 overturning of Roe v. Wade has mobilized suburban women to vote for Democrats. That helped Craig keep her seat.\n\nCraig was able to fend off challengers by walking a fine ideological line. While she strongly supports abortion rights and protecting social safety net programs, she also adopted some GOP stances, including a hard line on immigration, strong support for Israel and increased funding for police.\n\nCraig was also able to raise millions of dollars in races that drew in the support of the national parties. Her campaign spent nearly $8.3 million to successfully fend off GOP challenger Joe Teirab last year. Teirab spent about $3.2 million.\n\nSchultz said the best candidate for the race is a centrist who “can raise a lot of money. “\n\nTeirab may run again for the 2nd District seat. So may Tayler Rahm, a Republican who won the endorsement of the GOP at its 2nd District convention but dropped out of the Republican primary last year after being offered a job on the Trump campaign in Minnesota.\n\nAnd Tyler Kistner, who lost against Craig twice, is said to also be considering a run.\n\nThe two Matts\n\nTwo DFLers have already announced they are running for the 2nd District seat — state Sen. Matt Klein and former state Sen. Matt Little, who also served two terms as the mayor of Lakeville.\n\nAnother DFL state senator, Erin Maye Quade, may also jump into the race. Little said any one of the Democrats in the race will face a tough general election.\n\n“It’s going to be extremely competitive,” Little said. “Republicans are going to target this seat with everything they have.”\n\nLittle said he’d run on pocketbook issues like affordable childcare and allowing people who are younger than 65 to buy in to Medicare.\n\nHe’s aware Democrats need to keep the 2nd District seat if they hope to take back control of the U.S. House in the midterms, something that would require the flipping of just five seats.\n\n“The courts can’t do it alone,” Little said of the dozens of lawsuits challenging Trump’s use of his executive authority to remake the government. “We need to take back Congress.”\n\nLittle said his time as mayor of Lakeville gives him a boost in a major population area in the district and helps him campaign in rural south Dakota County.\n\nMeanwhile, Klein, a doctor of internal medicine, said he hopes to be elected to provide a “counterbalance of scientific fact and trust” to Health and Human Resources Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a vaccine skeptic.\n\nRepresenting the southeastern Twin Cities metropolitan area, Klein concedes that winning over the “red” areas of the district will be a challenge. And he’s willing to use Craig’s winning, centrist-driven formula.\n\n“The path has already been forged by Angie,” Klein said.\n\nHe also said the Democratic primary is likely to be as competitive as the general election. “Both will have different sets of challenges,” he said.\n\nKlein has said he won’t drop out of the race if he fails to win the DFL endorsement. And he said he won’t shift his message to appeal to the more progressive voters who show up at DFL primaries and the more moderate mix of voters who gave Craig victories over her GOP challengers.\n\n“If voters decide they don’t like my message, I’ll accept that,” Klein said.\n\nCovey, of the Cook Political Report, said there’s another advantage Democrats may have in the 2nd District besides a favorable demographic trend.\n\nTrump’s approval ratings have dropped and, traditionally, the party that holds the White House loses congressional seats in a midterm. “Given the historical trend one would think the party that is locked out of power will gain strength in the midterm,” she said.\n\nBut Covey cautioned it is too early in the campaign cycle to make hard and fast predictions.\n\n“Much will depend on Trump’s overall job approval next year, and there is always the ‘wild card’ of new issues or events that can unexpectedly intrude into a campaign,” Slocum said. “For example the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks tilted the 2002 elections in Republicans’ favor; the 2022 overturning of Roe v. Wade mostly worked in Democrats’ favor.”","summary":"With the swingiest congressional district in Minnesota up for grabs, two DFLers are already battling it out and other Democratic and GOP candidates are in the wings.\n\n\nThe post Race for Rep.

The American Accountability Foundation, a conservative government research nonprofit, found that much of the CBO's Health Analysis Division is made up of Democrats or Democratic donors. Of the 32 staff members in the division, 26 of them, or 84%, have \"clearly\" verified liberal partisan biases, being either a Democrat donor, a registered Democrat, or a Democratic primary voter, the group said in a memo outlining its findings, which come ahead of potential scrutiny of President Donald Trump's budget request. NPR, PBS CHIEFS SET TO CLASH WITH GOP LAWMAKERS DURING DOGE SUBCOMMITTEE HEARING \"The CBO likes to call itself ‘nonpartisan’ in an attempt to disguise its role as an undercover leftist think tank,\" AAF President Tom Jones said in a statement to Fox News Digital. \"In fact, the CBO is institutionally progressive, with 84% of its professional healthcare staff members being registered Democrats. These same staff members, who are on record donating to radicals like Elizabeth Warren and Hillary Clinton, ‘score’ legislation and present it to the American people like it’s sacrosanct.\" Jones accused the CBO staffers of not just voting left, but using their influence to promote progressive policy changes. DOGE SUBCOMMITTEE INVITES NPR, PBS CHIEFS TO TESTIFY ON THEIR FEDERAL FUNDING, ‘SYSTEMICALLY BIASED CONTENT’ \"The Health Analysis Division has been overtaken by liberal group think,\" the memo states. \"As policymakers consider pronouncements and scores from CBO over the coming weeks, they should regard those from the Health Care Analysis Division with deep suspicion and should likely disregard them as the product of a politically biased policy shop, much as they would analysis from an institution like the Center for American Progress.\" The HAD is tasked with analyzing federal programs and policies that include Medicare, Medicaid and subsidies provided through health insurance exchanges. Its staffers produce reports on policy issues and play a key role in certain estimates of proposed changes in health care programs, the CBO website states. The report noted that the CBO works to \"cultivate\" a reputation as a \"non-partisan scorekeeper, just balls and strikes.\" That reputation is so entrenched, the AAF said, that 1,358 different news media stories in the last year alone have appended the word \"nonpartisan\" to the beginning of the office’s name, reporting on the \"nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.\" \"While the CBO has spun a narrative through the mainstream media that it’s a neutral scorekeeper, it’s one big gaslighting campaign to distract from the office’s fundamentally progressive roots.\" Jones said. \"They know the next few months with reconciliation are crucial and will do everything they can to slam and stall the Trump administration’s policies.\" CBO employees are barred from engaging in political activity if it would \"identify, or appear to identify, CBO with a political campaign, candidate, officeholder, or cause,\" its website states. \"The specific positions taken are irrelevant; rather, the potential harm to CBO’s reputation for objectivity comes from association with political activity or public advocacy,\" it adds. The agency doesn't hire employment candidates based on their political affiliation, it said. Research conducted by the group found that Health Analysis Director Chapin White is a Democratic donor, having given money to former Secretary of State John Kerry. White made a $300 donation to Kerry's failed presidential bid in 2004, according to Federal Election Commission data. White referred Fox News Digital to the CBO, which declined to comment.

It sits alongside the Kennedy Center, on the bank of the Potomac River. The pair of buildings, each a cream-colored behemoth, were completed in the early nineteen-seventies, a fabled era in the capital, when Presidents feared journalists and the bipartisan élite dined together on lobster bisque and gossip. Katharine Graham, quiet, wry, and patrician, was then one of the most powerful women in America. She not only ran the Post’s business operations—following in the footsteps of her father, Eugene Meyer, and her husband, Phil Graham—but convened members of the Washington establishment around her dinner table in Georgetown, that “tiny kingdom,” as Phil Graham once called it.\nA few weeks earlier, Donald Trump had launched a hostile takeover of the Kennedy Center, naming himself its chair and ending a spirit of bipartisanship that had long reigned in one of D.C.’s most cherished cultural institutions. The center cancelled a performance by the Gay Men’s Chorus of Washington, D.C., and expressed an eagerness to book “Cats.” Now, as the lights dimmed, Graham’s son Don, dressed in a sports coat and New Balance sneakers, stepped up to the lectern. His mother, he said, “had to stand up to one President who had carried forty-nine states, and who truly, as you are about to see, wanted to use the government to destroy her newspaper and her company.”\nNixon’s Attorney General once told Bernstein that “Katie Graham’s gonna get her tit caught in a big fat wringer,” but Don Graham was likely also alluding to more recent events. He had succeeded his mother as the Post’s publisher, overseeing the paper’s business side for three decades before it was sold, in 2013, to the founder of Amazon, Jeff Bezos. Three years later, just before the 2016 Presidential election, Bezos said that Trump’s calls for retribution and his unwillingness to concede defeat “erodes our democracy around the edges.” But, in the weeks before the 2024 election, Bezos didn’t allow the Post to endorse a Presidential candidate—the editors had planned to back Kamala Harris—breaking with the paper’s long-standing tradition. After the election, he attended Trump’s Inauguration, to which his company donated a million dollars. Days before the Kennedy Center screening, Bezos announced another major shift at the paper. The Opinions section would feature pieces “in support and defense of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets,” and “viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others.”\nIn the days of Woodward and Bernstein, the Post’s remit had seemed clear: to hold the nation’s most powerful officials to account. Now its journalists were shaken not just by what some saw as Bezos’s capitulation to Trump but by a broader identity crisis at the paper. Those who could find work elsewhere left. In January, a former executive editor, Leonard Downie, Jr., and a former managing editor, Robert Kaiser, wrote in an e-mail to Bezos, “In our experience going back to the early 1960s, morale at The Post has never been lower.” Bezos never replied.\nAfter the film, guests drifted to a reception in a large gallery, where Woodward soon confronted Bill Murray. Murray had recently said on Joe Rogan’s podcast that he was so dismayed after reading “like, five pages” of “Wired,” Woodward’s 1984 book about Murray’s old friend John Belushi, that he thought, Oh, my God. They framed Nixon. At the reception, Woodward interrupted a conversation Murray was having with Klobuchar to defend his work. “Sometimes we learn by talking,” Woodward said. Murray turned away; Buffett’s publicist quickly intervened. Afterward, more than one attendee described the reception—which featured hot appetizers, white orchids, and a roomful of septuagenarians—as a wake for the Graham family’s Post.\nThe paper’s current leadership was noticeably absent. Will Lewis, a former executive at Rupert Murdoch’s Dow Jones, whom Bezos had appointed as the paper’s publisher in early 2024, had R.S.V.P.’d that he would attend and then asked to see the guest list. (Lewis denies asking to see the guest list.) He and the Post’s editor, Matt Murray, a recent arrival from the Wall Street Journal, had ultimately stayed away. Bezos was out of town, preferring instead to attend the Academy Awards with his fiancée, the journalist Lauren Sánchez.\nBezos was always seen as a somewhat distant owner. Amazon’s holdings now include Whole Foods, Zappos, the streaming site Twitch, and M-G-M Studios. Blue Origin, Bezos’s aerospace company, is a direct competitor of Elon Musk’s SpaceX in the race to privatize space travel. “He was sort of like a helicopter parent,” a former longtime employee at one of Bezos’s businesses told me, “giving a lot of direction on a Wednesday and then leaving us to pick up the pieces.” Still, no one seemed to know what his current vision for the Post might be. “In some ways, this is all a story about Jeff and how he changed over the course of his ownership and really became a different person with huge implications for the institution,” one former top editor told me. A journalist who knows Bezos said, “He’s on an intellectual journey. Wherever he lands, he’s thinking. Whatever it is, it’s a mind at work.”\nThe Post had been in the family since 1933, when Eugene Meyer, a former chairman of the Federal Reserve, bought it at auction. The Grahams, like the Sulzberger family, which has owned the New York Times for more than a century, viewed the paper not just as a business but as a civic trust. Don and his mother were fixtures in the Post’s headquarters on Fifteenth Street; Don seemed to know everyone’s name—reporters, receptionists, custodians. For years, the Post was a thriving regional monopoly, servicing one of the country’s wealthiest and most educated metropolitan areas.\nThe emergence of the internet threatened all that. In August, 1992, Kaiser, the managing editor, returned from a conference in Japan and wrote a memo to the paper’s leadership about the coming upheaval. “The Post is not in a pot of water, and we’re smarter than the average frog,” he said. “But we do find ourselves swimming in an electronic sea where we could eventually be devoured—or ignored as an unnecessary anachronism.” Within a decade, Craigslist had decimated the industry’s classified-ad revenues. In 2003, another Post managing editor, Steve Coll, proposed a plan to reconfigure the newsroom to adapt to the internet and use the paper’s name recognition to become more national in scope. Don Graham rejected the idea, saying that he wanted to maintain the paper’s local identity. Its strategy eventually became “For and about Washington.”\nWhat followed was years of shrinking print circulation punctuated by a series of staff buyouts. In 2007, a pair of Post staffers defected to found Politico, a digital news outlet that covered official Washington. Graham offered to partner with them in the new venture, but they declined. “It was clear that the age of expansion and conquering the world had ended, and it was not clear how we were going to turn it around,” Eugene Robinson, a longtime Post editor and columnist, said. Martin Baron, who became the paper’s executive editor in 2013, told me that, when he took the job, he expected to oversee additional cuts: “It looked like that’s what it was going to be like, year after year.”\nGraham was heartbroken about the prospect of selling the Post, but he viewed a sale to a worthy owner as a final act of service. Warren Buffett—who has been a friend of the Graham family’s since the early nineteen-seventies, when he bailed out the Post—recommended Bezos as a potential buyer. At the time, Bezos was worth $27.2 billion—about a tenth of his current net worth—but still living a relatively low-key life in Seattle. He was married to MacKenzie Scott, a Princeton-educated novelist, with whom he had four children. In a 2013 Vogue article about Scott, who was promoting a new novel, Bezos called her “resourceful, smart, brainy, and hot.” He liked to shop for her clothes. Scott drove the Vogue writer around Seattle in her minivan and talked about avoiding the limelight. “Jeff is the opposite of me,” she said. “He likes to meet people. He’s a very social guy.”\nGraham and Bezos met to discuss a sale at the Sun Valley Conference, an annual retreat in Idaho that is popularly known as a “summer camp for billionaires.” Graham emphasized that owning a newspaper came with a particular set of challenges. Bezos’s businesses could be hurt by association; the paper’s journalists would likely report on him. But for Bezos, who had made his fortune in part by siphoning revenue from local bookstores, buying the Post seemed like an act of redemption. Baron told me that Bezos, the adopted son of a Cuban immigrant, felt a sincere commitment to the paper’s mission. “I think Bezos fundamentally believes in the country and believes in democracy and thought it was an important institution,” he said. Ultimately, Bezos purchased the paper for two hundred and fifty million dollars.\nMany Post staff members were initially skeptical of the new owner. “The case against Jeff Bezos,” Ezra Klein wrote on the Post’s Wonkblog, was that “Amazon’s political interests extend across everything from state sales taxes to the minimum wage to trade with China.” Bezos wrote a letter that was published in the paper, seeking to reassure readers and his new employees alike of his good intentions. “The values of The Post do not need changing,” he said. “The paper’s duty will remain to its readers and not to the private interests of its owners.”\nBaron, who had edited the Boston Globe during its “Spotlight” investigation into the Catholic Church’s child-sexual-abuse coverup, ran the newsroom. Fred Hiatt led the paper’s Opinions section, a position he’d held for more than two decades. Hiatt was widely admired for, as one colleague put it, “an unassuming nature coupled with an unassailable intellect.” His section was center left on domestic issues and tilted more to the right on foreign affairs; Bezos, according to a Post report at the time, had said that “his political views were already in line with those of The Post’s editorial page.” Members of the newsroom researched Bezos’s past political contributions and found that he and Scott had donated to a gay-rights group in the state of Washington. “So people sort of took him to be a liberal with a libertarian streak,” Cameron Barr, a former senior managing editor, told me.\nDuring Bezos’s first year as owner, he was heavily involved in the development of a tablet app for the paper, which the company called Project Rainbow. “He showed up and he said that he thought mobile was the future,” one former business-side staffer told me. “He believed that we needed to compete by building a real national product.” Bezos was often less assured when it came to understanding the newspaper’s history and culture. In October, 2014, Ben Bradlee, the Post’s editor during the seventies and eighties, died, at the age of ninety-three. Bezos did not plan to attend the funeral, which was to be held at the Washington National Cathedral. According to Baron’s memoir, “Collision of Power: Trump, Bezos, and the Washington Post,” Woodward sent Bezos an e-mail: “Understand you’re not coming to the Bradlee funeral. He was the soul of the institution that’s now yours.” Bezos hopped on his private jet and flew to Washington. “You could see him absorbing that he was buying not just a technological toy, but that he had bought a national treasure,” one funeral attendee told me. “In retrospect, it was a powerful moment.”\nThat same year, the Post’s Tehran bureau chief, Jason Rezaian, was imprisoned on espionage charges in Iran. When he and his wife were finally allowed to leave the country, in January, 2016, Bezos met them in Germany and flew them back to the U.S. on his plane, dropping them off in Key West for an all-expenses-paid vacation. A few days later, Rezaian appeared at the opening ceremony for the Post’s new headquarters on K Street, a sleek, light-filled space. “Important institutions like the Post have an essence, they have a heart, they have a core,” Bezos said at the event, “and if you wanted that to change, you’d be crazy.” Still, he sought to avoid unchecked nostalgia. “I’m a huge fan of leaning into the future,” he said. “Too much glamorizing of the past would certainly lead to paralysis.”\nWeeks before the election, the Post broke the story of Trump’s lewd comment to “Access Hollywood” ’s host Billy Bush about grabbing women’s genitals. Many of the paper’s blockbuster reports during the campaign covered Trump’s past business dealings in Russia and Russian interference in the election, a line of inquiry that only intensified after Trump’s victory. Soon after the Inauguration, the Post débuted a new motto, “Democracy Dies in Darkness,” a favorite saying of Bob Woodward’s that was seen as a direct rebuke of the new President. (MacKenzie Scott had called an earlier option—“A Free People Demand to Know”—a “Frankenslogan.”) Behind the scenes, though, Bezos seemed to urge caution. Baron, in his book, writes that “in the days before Trump took office” Bezos had asked Hiatt, the opinion editor, to show “support for Trump on whatever issues he could.”\nOtherwise, Bezos never interfered in newsroom decision-making, a distance that won him the affection of his paper’s journalists. At a Post event in 2016, Baron asked Bezos if he thought Trump was “now threatening to put one of your body parts through a wringer.” Bezos said that he had “a lot of very sensitive and vulnerable body parts but, if need be, they can all go through the wringer rather than do the wrong thing.” Later, Bezos installed an antique wringer in one of the paper’s conference rooms.\nBezos’s ownership of the Post was creating complications for his other businesses. Amazon held a large contract with the government to handle cloud computing for intelligence agencies, and it was in the running for a similar contract with the Pentagon worth ten billion dollars. In 2018, a source told Axios that Trump was “obsessed” with Amazon and had considered bringing an antitrust suit against the company and changing its tax status. The following year, Amazon lost the Pentagon’s cloud-computing contract to Microsoft. Amazon filed a lawsuit claiming that Trump had improperly pressured Defense Department officials on the decision. The Pentagon eventually scrapped the original contract and announced that, instead, Google, Oracle, Microsoft, and Amazon would compete for parts of it on an ongoing basis. On paper, Robinson told me, Bezos had paid two hundred and fifty million dollars for the Post—“but, really, he paid ten billion.”\nOn October 2, 2018, Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi Arabian dissident who, after leaving his home country, had become an opinion columnist for the Post, disappeared while visiting the Saudi Embassy in Istanbul. “Let me know what I can do to help,” Bezos told the Post’s publisher at the time, Fred Ryan. The C.I.A. later concluded that the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, had ordered the killing of Khashoggi, whose body was reportedly dismembered with a bone saw and carried out of the Embassy in suitcases. Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner had established close ties to the crown prince; the Administration was criticized for not doing more to pursue the perpetrators. The Post’s coverage of Khashoggi’s murder, which included breaking the news of the C.I.A.’s findings, earned the paper a spot as a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for public service. But Bezos didn’t speak publicly about the incident until a year later, at a memorial event held on the anniversary of Khashoggi’s death. As CNBC reported, Amazon Web Services had been working on a deal to set up data centers in Saudi Arabia. Baron told me that, on such matters, Bezos often offered public comment only when explicitly asked to do so.\nPrivately, Bezos seemed to be undergoing an evolution. Whereas once he had been physically unprepossessing, he was now, thanks to regular cardio and weight-lifting sessions with a celebrity trainer, roped with muscle. He invariably showed off his new biceps and pecs by wearing a tight T-shirt. Close associates joked with him about his transformation, but it seemed more than skin-deep. In 2016, Amazon Studios distributed “Manchester by the Sea,” which was nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards. Bezos attended the ceremony for the first time. Seeing him in the thrall of Hollywood was perplexing, the former longtime employee said, and “honestly, hilarious. I was just, like, ‘Who is this guy?’ ”\nThe biggest change of all was personal. On January 9, 2019, Bezos announced that, “after a long period of loving exploration and trial separation,” he and Scott were filing for divorce. The following day, the National Enquirer published a story that exposed his affair with Sánchez, a former television news reporter who was married to Patrick Whitesell, the executive chairman of the talent agency Endeavor; an accompanying photo caption identified Bezos as the “owner of The Washington Post.” Trump tweeted with apparent glee, “So sorry to hear the news about Jeff Bozo being taken down by a competitor whose reporting, I understand, is far more accurate than the reporting in his lobbyist newspaper, the Amazon Washington Post.”\nA month later, in a post on Medium, Bezos accused the National Enquirer of blackmail. He seemed to imply that the Saudis, and perhaps Trump, who was a friend of the National Enquirer’s publisher David Pecker, were behind the leaking of some private texts. “It’s unavoidable that certain powerful people who experience Washington Post news coverage will wrongly conclude I am their enemy,” Bezos wrote. (It was later reported that Sánchez’s brother, Michael, had sold the texts to the National Enquirer for two hundred thousand dollars, which he denies.) Bezos went on to assure readers that “my stewardship of The Post and my support of its mission, which will remain unswerving, is something I will be most proud of when I’m 90 and reviewing my life, if I’m lucky enough to live that long, regardless of any complexities it creates for me.”\nWhen Trump lost the 2020 election, Bezos posted a picture on Instagram of a grinning Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, and wrote, “Unity, empathy, and decency are not characteristics of a bygone era.” But readers who had obsessively tracked Trump’s four convulsive years in office were ready to tune out the relative normalcy of the Biden White House; the Post lost about three hundred thousand subscribers in the first year of Biden’s Presidency. Some in the newsroom had warned that, to prepare for the end of Trump’s term, the Post needed to diversify its offerings—what Fred Ryan, the publisher, called a “bundle strategy”—in a manner similar to the Times, which had expanded its business through apps dedicated to cooking and games. Baron told me that he had begun to worry about the Post’s business model in the aftermath of the 2018 midterms, when it became clear that Trump might lose the general election. “I thought that we needed to bring Bezos in for a big strategy discussion,” he said. The meeting never happened.\nIn May, 2021, Sally Buzbee, who previously ran the Associated Press, was named the paper’s new executive editor. She had led an international newsroom, but staffers worried that she wouldn’t be able to imprint a new identity on the paper. “Sally was a wire-service person,” the former Post reporter said. “She spoke of each story as an autonomous thing, and the voice of the whole project started to get lost.”\nThat December, Hiatt, the opinion editor, died unexpectedly, of cardiac arrest, at the age of sixty-six. Seven months later, David Shipley, who had run Bloomberg Opinion and the Times editorial page, took over the job; the Post’s writeup of the hire noted that he was the “second top editor to be appointed by publisher Fred Ryan from outside the newspaper.” Many sensed that Ryan, a former aide in the Reagan White House and Bezos’s main contact at the paper, was eager to assert himself. “Fred felt like the newsroom was not the newsroom he really wanted,” a former longtime editor said. “I think some of that was personal—he just didn’t like a lot of people.”\nBezos, meanwhile, was becoming a far more public figure. Back in 2014, he had said, “I like to be at home. I like to be in the office. I feel disconnected from the office if I’m travelling a lot.” Now he and Sánchez were photographed having dinner in New York and Miami, shopping on St. Barts, wearing coördinated stripes at Wimbledon, and hosting a disco-themed New Year’s Eve party. In 2016, Bezos had purchased the largest private home in D.C., for twenty-three million dollars. Jean Case, the wife of an AOL founder, had told the magazine Washingtonian that Bezos and Scott were going to “revive the legacy of Kay Graham and her great socializing—bringing smart, interesting people together in a social context.” By the time the house made its début, in January, 2020, it was Sánchez, not Scott, who served as Bezos’s co-host for a black-tie gathering attended by Kellyanne Conway, Jerome Powell, Jared Kushner, and Ivanka Trump. The home, one person told Washingtonian, was “very theatrical.” Someone else who has visited told me that the house has the feel of a museum; Bezos has on display, among other rare collectibles, a lock from the Watergate break-in.\nBezos had stepped down as C.E.O. of Amazon in 2021, handing off its day-to-day operations to Andy Jassy, one of his longtime deputies. The following year, the American Innovation and Choice Online Act, a bill that would have blocked online retailers from featuring their own brands’ goods and services more prominently on their platforms, passed out of the Senate Judiciary Committee with bipartisan support. Industry groups representing the likes of Amazon and Google launched a thirty-six-million-dollar ad campaign claiming that the bill would “threaten our fragile economic recovery.” The tech companies’ attitude, a former Senate staffer told me, was “We’re not here to negotiate. We are here to crush this thing and murder anyone who even thinks about voting for it.” The bill never made it to the Senate floor.\nThe Biden Administration had appointed Lina Khan, the author of a 2017 Yale Law Journal article titled “Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox,” to be the chair of the Federal Trade Commission. Khan’s paper had argued that, given Amazon’s ubiquity in American life, the company should either be subject to strong antitrust enforcement or be regulated like a public utility. Shortly after Khan was confirmed by the Senate, Amazon filed a motion requesting that she recuse herself from regulatory actions involving the company. Instead, her agency aggressively pursued a number of open investigations into Amazon’s business practices. “Some of these companies and executives were used to a certain degree of legal immunity,” Khan told me. “So, when we started enforcing the law, it seemed to trigger a deep hysteria and backlash.”\nJay Carney, a former White House press secretary for Barack Obama, headed Amazon’s communications team, but the company’s relations with the Biden Administration and other Democratic politicians deteriorated. Biden met with labor leaders who supported Amazon workers’ unionization drive. Leading Party figures, such as Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, routinely criticized the company’s reach. At one point, when a Democratic backbencher, Mark Pocan, of Wisconsin, tweeted about the company’s workers feeling so pressured to make timely deliveries that they skipped bathroom breaks, the Amazon News account responded, “You don’t really believe the peeing in bottles thing, do you?” (The company later apologized for the tweet.)\nIn 2023, the F.T.C. and seventeen state attorneys general brought a suit against Amazon, claiming that it was illegally maintaining monopoly power. Bezos felt a sense of betrayal. “Jeff really stuck his neck out, in his view, in the first Trump term, and weathered all that heat and criticism,” a longtime Post staffer said. “And his thanks for that from the Biden Administration is to have Lina Khan unleashed on him.” Last year, the billionaire investor Marc Andreessen, a friend of Bezos’s who once gave generously to Democrats, announced that he would back Trump. In a recent interview with the Times, Andreessen said his cohort believed that the Biden Administration had targeted the tech industry “in a very broad-based way.” There were, he said, “lots and lots of underground peer-to-peer discussions” about how things had gone “off the rails.”\nBezos set out to prove himself an attentive listener. During his meetings with Post journalists, he took copious notes in a leather-bound notebook, stopping occasionally to confirm that he understood certain points. One journalist who met with him said that he seemed interested in making acquisitions to rapidly expand the Post’s audience. Another was surprised by how out of touch he seemed with the paper. “He is isolated, and he hasn’t done the work to engage and be a hands-on owner,” the journalist said. “If you are going to own a media property right now, you need to be all in and understand the landscape.”\nFor years, most of Bezos’s ideas for the Post seemed based on his experience at Amazon. “He said, ‘I’d rather have two hundred million subscribers paying ten dollars a year than a smaller number paying a higher price,’ ” another former editor told me. “Just supersize the number. That was always his idea of a really successful digital news organization.” But, at a time when mainstream media outlets are widely distrusted, the number of people who want to pay for quality news in America is distinctly smaller than the number of those who want to order two-ply toilet paper that will arrive the next day. “For such a smart, accomplished guy, who has owned the business for as long as he has,” one person who’s had conversations with Bezos about the paper said, “he is too timid about the operating levers he can pull and too ambitious about the commercial reach of the paper.”\nAfter his visit, Bezos had the thought, one person with knowledge of internal conversations said, that “the American media was too coastal, and that the Washington Post needed to get out of Washington.” He initiated what came to be called Project America, which explored ideas such as getting Substack writers from other U.S. cities to write a few times a month, or working with regional publications to license or co-publish stories. None of the initiatives have yet been launched, but Project America marked a new level of involvement for Bezos. “Fred Hiatt’s death was, in hindsight, even more of a catastrophe than it seemed,” a longtime staffer told me. Shipley, the Opinions section’s new editor, “understandably thought it would help everyone if Jeff were more engaged.” Instead, the staffer went on, “Bezos grabbed it with both hands.”\nIn June, 2023, Ryan stepped down as publisher. Patty Stonesifer, a former Microsoft executive who had run the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation—and who has served on the Amazon board since 1997—replaced him as interim C.E.O. According to another former Post reporter, Stonesifer was shocked at the state of the paper’s business: “She felt Fred was either delusional or he was really ignorant about what the future of the paper looked like.” (Stonesifer denies questioning Ryan’s competence, saying he had a “solid grasp on the facts.”) That October, the Post announced that it would be cutting an additional two hundred and forty jobs. “I have come to think of her,” a Post reporter said of Stonesifer, “as the minister of death.”\nLewis had spent the early part of his career as a mergers-and-acquisitions reporter at the Financial Times, where his editor in New York was an Australian named Robert Thomson, who is now the C.E.O. of Murdoch’s News Corp. In 2006, at the age of thirty-seven, Lewis became the youngest-ever editor of the Daily Telegraph, which he overhauled to become more digitally focussed, creating a weeklong training program in a dummy newsroom. “It was an old, staid conservative newspaper,” one former Telegraph reporter said. “The readership was retired military and their wives, and Will turned it into a scoop-getting competitive newspaper.”\nLewis, who was raised in a middle-class home in a suburb of London, became a minor celebrity in the British press. His brother, Simon, had served as Queen Elizabeth’s communications secretary and went on to work for Gordon Brown, the British Prime Minister. At the Telegraph, Lewis had “a clique of mannish guys,” the former reporter said, and a reputation for hard drinking. Private Eye nicknamed him “Thirsty” Will Lewis, but the Guardian noted, “No one has ever seen him drunk, late for work, or anything less than intensely focused.” A person who has known Lewis for decades described him to me as a “wide boy”—British slang for someone who survives by his wits, often on the wrong side of right.\nIn 2010, Lewis was hired by News International, a subsidiary of News Corp, where he reported directly to the company’s chief executive, Rebekah Brooks. She and Lewis were friends; Brooks had attended Lewis’s fortieth-birthday party at a London pub, a casual bash featuring karaoke and a high-powered guest list that included the future Prime Minister David Cameron. At the time, Scotland Yard was investigating accusations that reporters at two of the company’s papers, News of the World and the Sun, had illegally hacked into the phones of politicians, celebrities, royals, and even a dead teen-age girl. Lewis, who was seen as “untainted,” according to a longtime colleague, was tapped to help contain the situation. Later, the New York Times reported that Scotland Yard suspected, according to internal documents, that News International was attempting to “steer the investigation into a very narrow remit,” by directing investigators to look at certain journalists and “steering the investigation away from other journalists and editors.”\nIn 2014, Brooks—a protégé of Murdoch’s—was cleared of hacking charges. But a News International editor named Andy Coulson was sentenced to eighteen months in prison. That year, Lewis got a promotion, moving to a role as publisher of the Wall Street Journal and C.E.O. of News Corp’s Dow Jones division, where he worked under Thomson, his former editor. Lewis oversaw rapid growth at the paper—during his tenure, the Wall Street Journal increased its digital-subscriber numbers from seven hundred thousand to more than two million—and in 2020 he was on a shortlist to become the next director general of the BBC. During the hiring process, documents emerged in lawsuits brought by dozens of individuals, including Prince Harry and Hugh Grant, who claimed that News International papers had illegally hacked their phones. The documents alleged that, while the company was being investigated, Lewis had approved a plan that resulted in the deletion of millions of e-mails from News International’s servers. Lewis has denied any illegal conduct. A month after the revelations, the BBC job went to another candidate.\nInstead, Lewis helped found a news startup focussed on Gen Z and launched his own public-relations consultancy. He reportedly advised then Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who held a series of parties at 10 Downing Street during the COVID pandemic, when lockdown rules were in place. According to the Guardian, after news of the Prime Minister’s infractions surfaced, Lewis recommended that Johnson and others “clean up” their phones. Both Lewis and Johnson have said that the story is untrue. Johnson later recommended Lewis for a knighthood, which he received in 2023.\nThat same year, Lewis was involved in an attempt to buy the Telegraph. In an interview with Bloomberg, he said that he had “significant expressions of interest from a wide range of potential backers.” The Daily Beast reported that one of the prospective investors he solicited was Jeff Bezos, which both Lewis and Bezos have denied. In any event, Lewis aborted his bid after Bezos hired him to run the Washington Post.\nSally Quinn, a former Post writer and the widow of Ben Bradlee, invited Lewis into her Georgetown social sphere. People liked his wife, Rebecca, she said—“an Emma Thompson type.” One of the couple’s children worked for Maggie Hassan, a Democratic senator from New Hampshire, and was already living in D.C. Lewis and his wife purchased a Colonial Williamsburg-style house in a tucked-away corner of Georgetown for seven million dollars. Lewis told the Evening Standard of his plans for the Post—“We’re going to get our swagger back”—and attributed his rise to a “fear of being found out and getting up every day at five.”\nLewis had grand ambitions. “He very quickly declared that he soon wanted to have three million subscribers,” a former staffer said. He began hosting “say-it sessions,” where staff members were encouraged to describe what they thought the company was doing wrong. Many of them were simply eager to do anything that might help turn around the business. “Everything felt like a gimmick,” a former editor said. “You could tell there was a lot of bullshit, but maybe we needed that.”\nSome early moves rankled the Post’s staff. Lewis made a troika of former Dow Jones strategists part of his close-knit executive team. His chief of staff appeared on the paper’s masthead one day without any internal announcement. Lewis also had his own communications staffer in London, who operated independently of the Post’s publicity department. (Recently, the Post’s chief communications officer resigned, reportedly owing to repeated clashes with Lewis.)\nAt Bezos’s behest, Lewis actively began searching for acquisition opportunities. Less than a month into his tenure, he sat for an interview with Ben Smith, the co-founder of the news site Semafor. As they began their conversation, Lewis appeared to propose some sort of partnership, telling Smith, “If we want to do something together, we should find a way to do some business.” Smith responded, “This is the wrong meeting.” Lewis was undeterred: “I think us partnering with startups and people in early phases is really good for us.” Later, Smith told me that Lewis never followed up. “I don’t think he was joking—Will is always trying to do some kind of deal,” Smith said. “Obviously, we would have been open to talking.”\nAround the same time, Lewis and Buzbee travelled to Davos. According to one person with knowledge of the incident, as Buzbee was on her way to an early-morning meeting that she and Lewis had scheduled with top leadership of Microsoft to discuss, among other things, issues concerning A.I., she received a message from Lewis saying that he was sick and that Buzbee should attend solo. She was rattled that he would miss such an important meeting; the previous month, the Times had sued Microsoft and OpenAI for copyright infringement. A few hours later, Lewis appeared at another Davos event, in high spirits.\nMeanwhile, tensions between Lewis and the newsroom were escalating. In March, the Post ran a story about the News International lawsuits in London; it later emerged that Lewis had put pressure on Buzbee not to run it, but Lewis has denied this. Matea Gold, a well-regarded managing editor, had initially overseen the Lewis reporting. Later, Cameron Barr, the former senior managing editor, was brought in and given final say over edits on stories about Lewis. A person who spoke with Lewis last year told me that Lewis thought American journalists were “obsessed with their own drama.”\nThat May, Lewis held a town-hall meeting announcing the “build it” phase of his strategy. The Post, he said, had lost seventy-seven million dollars the previous year. The paper would be moving toward a system that allowed readers to pay to access single articles, enabled by what he called “frictionless payments.” The paper would also be rolling out Post Pro and Post Plus, payment tiers that mimicked offerings from Politico and Punchbowl News, which charge a premium for industry-specific news stories. (Lewis has also been pursuing an acquisition of Punchbowl News.)\nEleven days later, the Times reported on a number of changes taking place at the Post. Lewis dashed off a note to the staff, confirming the story’s details: Buzbee was leaving her job as executive editor, and the Post was launching what he called a third newsroom, which would focus on producing service journalism and content for social media. “We’re all kind of, like, ‘What the fuck, a third newsroom? What are you talking about?’ ” one of the former reporters told me. Buzbee, who disagreed with the restructure, had been offered the job of running it. Seeing the move as a demotion, she had refused. Now she was out.\nThe next day, Lewis gathered the staff and introduced Matt Murray, the former editor-in-chief of the Wall Street Journal, who, he said, would be leading the newsroom through the election. A former colleague of Lewis’s from the Telegraph, Robert Winnett, would then take over as executive editor. “The cynical interpretation is that it sort of feels like you chose two of your buddies,” Ashley Parker, one of the paper’s White House correspondents, told Lewis. “And now we have four white men running three newsrooms.” (Parker later left the Post, along with several others, for The Atlantic.) Caroline Kitchener, a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative journalist, pressed Lewis about whether he had interviewed any women or people of color for the job. Lewis erupted. “If you don’t like the way I’m doing things, you can feel free to leave,” he said. (Kitchener now works at the Times.) Later in the meeting, Lewis said, “We are losing large amounts of money. Your audience has halved in recent years. People are not reading your stuff, right? I can’t sugarcoat it anymore. So I’ve had to take decisive, urgent action to set us on a different path, sourcing talent that I have worked with that are the best of the best.”\nMany journalists I spoke with described the moment as a mask falling away. “That was when it felt like we had entered a whole new era,” one of the former editors said. “It’s when I would say everybody started communicating with each other on Signal, rather than Slack.”\nNPR’s media correspondent David Folkenflik later revealed that Lewis had attempted to persuade him not to run a story on the British lawsuits, and had offered in exchange an exclusive interview on the Post’s business plan—a quid pro quo that was a clear violation of journalistic ethics. In a story in the Post, which reported on Lewis’s efforts to get Buzbee not to publish stories about the lawsuits, he was quoted calling Folkenflik “an activist, not a journalist.” Lewis claimed the account of his meetings with Buzbee was “inaccurate,” as part of a parsing denial that disturbed many in the newsroom. “To have the publisher of the Washington Post playing some bullshit fucking game like that in our own paper was deeply embarrassing and troubling, because that’s what we do for a living,” another former Post reporter told me. “We go after powerful people who then come back with bullshit that is transparently deceptive, and then we blow it up.”\nWithin days, a team of reporters at the Post published a piece about Winnett, the incoming executive editor, that detailed how, as a journalist at Britain’s Sunday Times, he had worked with a trained actor who sometimes misrepresented himself to obtain information for stories. Winnett opted to walk away from the position. Bezos sent a note to the Post’s internal newsletter voicing implicit support for Lewis. “Team—I know you’ve already heard this from Will, but I wanted to also weigh in directly: the journalistic standards and ethics at The Post will not change,” Bezos wrote. “The world is evolving rapidly and we do need to change as a business. With your support, we’ll do that and lead this great institution into the future.”\nThat spring, Bezos and Sánchez purchased their third property on Indian Creek Island, in Miami-Dade County, where their neighbors include Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump. Sánchez is also friends with Donald Trump, Jr.,’s girlfriend, Bettina Anderson, a Palm Beach socialite. Bezos and Sánchez spent much of the summer island-hopping in the Mediterranean on Koru, a five-hundred-million-dollar superyacht whose name refers to a Maori symbol for new beginnings. They were joined at one point by Kim Kardashian, whose mother, Kris Jenner, had previously been spotted at Coachella with Sánchez and Bezos. (Sánchez and Kardashian employ the same publicist.) Sánchez is described by those who know her as warm and charming, with deep connections in the entertainment industry. “I think Lauren is very influential,” the former senior editor told me. “Maybe not in the hands-on decisions throughout the Post, but certainly in the orientation of it.”\nThe 2024 Presidential campaign was under way, and Lewis, Shipley, and others on the Post’s opinion pages were trying to speak with Bezos. An attempt to meet with him in late spring was waylaid, in part, by the fallout from Lewis’s disastrous all-hands meeting. In July, according to Axios, Bezos had a phone call with Trump, in which he recommended that the former President pick Doug Burgum, then the governor of North Dakota, as his running mate. In August, after Biden had dropped out of the race and Harris replaced him as the Democratic nominee, the opinion leadership was told that Bezos’s schedule was full until late September.\nAt that point, Shipley and two deputies flew to Miami to meet with Bezos and Lewis; the paper’s endorsement wasn’t on the agenda, but Bezos expressed mild curiosity about why the paper needed to endorse a candidate at all. Murray also met with Bezos and Lewis in Miami and later told other editors that Bezos wanted the paper to “widen its aperture,” one person said. “Jeff apparently started pulling up the Atlantic app and was saying, ‘Why don’t we do these stories?’ It was almost like someone who descended from another world.” Bezos had said that he wanted the Post to broaden its appeal, but he was pointing to a magazine with a targeted audience. Bezos also mentioned that he thought more firefighters from Nebraska should be reading the Post. (Bezos declined to speak with me.)\nJust two weeks before the election, Bezos decided that he didn’t want the paper to endorse either candidate. Shipley tried to change his mind—given the timing, it would appear as if Bezos were bowing to Trump. Lewis, whose daughter was then working for the Harris campaign, announced the paper’s decision not to make an endorsement. The news was met with predictable outrage. “This is cowardice, with democracy as its casualty,” Baron, the former executive editor, wrote on X. “@realdonaldtrump will see this as an invitation to further intimidate owner @jeffbezos (and others). Disturbing spinelessness at an institution famed for courage.” Almost overnight, two hundred and fifty thousand Post subscribers cancelled their subscriptions. On the day of the announcement, the C.E.O. of Blue Origin met briefly with Trump after one of Trump’s rallies. Bezos has said that the two events were unrelated.\nIn an op-ed for the Post, Bezos attempted to explain his decision. He acknowledged that the announcement was poorly timed, and attributed this to “inadequate planning.” But the larger issue, he said, was Americans’ distrust in media. “We must be accurate, and we must be believed to be accurate,” he wrote. “It’s a bitter pill to swallow, but we are failing on the second requirement.” Bezos’s words seemed pointedly directed at his own newsroom: “It would be easy to blame others for our long and continuing fall in credibility (and, therefore, decline in impact), but a victim mentality will not help. Complaining is not a strategy.”\nThe paper still hadn’t decided on an executive editor after Winnett’s appointment fell through. Gold, who had helped run the coverage of the News International lawsuits, was vying for the position. When it was decided that she would not advance in the process, Wayne Connell, the head of H.R., not Lewis, delivered the news. The top candidate, Clifford Levy, a deputy managing editor at the Times, withdrew his name from consideration. No other outside candidates remained, leaving Murray as the de-facto leader. Lewis never officially announced that Murray had the job. Instead, a Times reporter wrote in early January that Murray, in response to a question at a meeting, had confirmed that he would continue on as the head editor.\nLast year, awards were given, but without a company-wide ceremony. Staff members were upset. One person called it part of Lewis’s “De-Grahamification” of the Post. The newsroom decided to host an informal gathering anyway, assembling just before Christmas. The tone was sombre. Sally Jenkins and Dan Balz, two longtime staffers, became emotional, talking about what the paper had meant to them. Lewis, who had only occasionally been seen in the newsroom since the previous spring’s all-hands meeting, did not attend.\nInstead, in January, he hosted a small dinner for the awardees in one of the building’s private suites. Lewis skipped the cocktail hour, but spoke during the seated dinner about how the paper’s recent innovations had made it the envy of its competitors. Earlier in the month, the Post had débuted a new internal mission statement—“Riveting Storytelling for All of America”—and the paper’s chief strategy officer, Suzi Watford, had laid out a “Big Hairy Audacious Goal” of generating two hundred million “paying users” through a flexible payment system and “distribution partnerships.” When I spoke with Watford, she said that such targets are typically attached to a ten-year horizon; the Post wasn’t attaching any hard time horizons.\nNews websites such as those of CNN and the Times are often visited by more than a hundred million users in a month, but a slim margin of them are paying subscribers. The Post currently has about 2.5 million digital subscribers; the Times has 11.4 million. One of the former Post editors called the idea of generating two hundred million paying users “intellectually dishonest,” in part because it sidestepped the issue of who the Post thought its audience should be. Bezos, in his op-ed about the Presidential endorsement, had said that the Post and the Times “talk only to a certain elite”—but a certain élite is also who is most willing to pay for news. Going forward, Watford said, “I think we will have a much broader appeal.”\nDon Graham had been invited to the event as a nod to the paper’s legacy. He rose to speak and gave a history of the awards. Then he went off script. Graham, who is eighty and still worth half a billion dollars, had not tried to be involved in the Post’s leadership decisions, he said. But during the past few months many staff members had reached out to him. Morale, he said, was low. Lewis, sitting nearby, stared at his place setting. “It was such a wild moment,” one attendee told me.\nDozens of staffers have left the Post in recent months. Earlier this year, after Philip Rucker, a Pulitzer Prize-winning editor, received an offer from CNN, Lewis scheduled a meeting with him. It was supposed to be a final attempt to keep a high-profile journalist, but Lewis cancelled at the last minute. Hundreds of staff members had sent a letter to Bezos that day, asking him to intervene at the paper. “We are deeply alarmed by recent leadership decisions that have led readers to question the integrity of this institution, broken with a tradition of transparency and prompted some of our most distinguished colleagues to leave, with more departures imminent,” the authors wrote.\nOne person who has had conversations with the Post’s leadership said that Lewis and his top deputies now speak of the newsroom with “vitriol.” “They were constantly infantilizing them and constantly talking about how they needed to be disciplined,” the person said. (A spokesperson for the Post denied this, saying that Lewis has “tremendous respect and appreciation for his colleagues.”) In exit interviews, meanwhile, staff members have attributed their departures to Lewis’s lack of a discernible plan for the paper. “The idea that the newsroom is the reason for the Post’s struggles is unfair,” one former top editor said. “The newsroom is not always its own best friend, but Will somehow convinced Jeff that it is the problem, when really there is no business strategy.” Murray acknowledged to one departing staffer, “Will has his challenges.”\nJust before Christmas, Bezos and Sánchez dined with Trump and his wife, Melania, at Mar-a-Lago. During the meal, according to the Wall Street Journal, Melania told Bezos and Sánchez about a documentary project she was developing based on her own life. Two weeks later, Amazon licensed the film for forty million dollars, nearly three times more than the company had ever spent on a documentary. As much as twenty-eight million dollars of the licensing fee will go directly to the First Lady.\nIn late February—after Trump pardoned the defendants of the January 6th riot, announced tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China, and signed executive orders banning diversity initiatives in the federal government, denying the existence of transgender people and barring them from serving in the military, overturning birthright citizenship, and declaring a national emergency at the southern border—Bezos announced the new direction of the Opinions section. “I’m confident that free markets and personal liberties are right for America,” Bezos wrote in a note to the staff. “I also believe these viewpoints are underserved in the current market of ideas and news opinion.” Shipley, the section’s editor, stepped down. That evening, Bezos had dinner with Trump.\nIn the aftermath of Bezos’s announcement, the Post moved to shut down dissenting opinions. A column about the directive by Erik Wemple, the Post’s media critic, was reportedly killed. Ruth Marcus, a columnist who had worked at the paper for more than four decades, left after Lewis killed a piece that was critical of Bezos’s instructions. (Marcus later wrote about the experience for The New Yorker.) Eugene Robinson also quit, writing, “The announced ‘significant shift’ in our section’s mission has spurred me to decide that it’s time for my next chapter.”\nWhen Bezos was first contemplating changes to the Post’s Opinions section, he discussed the issue with Barry Diller, the media mogul who, alongside Murdoch, helped found the Fox Broadcasting Company. “I did speak extensively with him when he was thinking of adopting a more refined, let’s call it, editorial policy,” Diller told me. The new focus, Diller said, reflected views that Bezos has long held. But there was also a risk, Diller acknowledged. Bezos’s motivations could be misconstrued as pursuing an “evenhanded relationship with a new and potentially dangerous Administration.” That, unfortunately or not for Bezos, seems to have come to pass. “I’ve gotten to know him, and I think he’s trying to do a real job,” Trump said of Bezos in March. “Jeff Bezos is trying to do a real job with the Washington Post, and that wasn’t happening before.”\nBezos has yet to clarify what, exactly, a focus on “free markets and personal liberties” might mean for the Post’s Opinions section. He and Sánchez are both devoted readers of Bari Weiss’s Free Press, a Substack publication that espouses a broadly anti-woke ideology. Last year, the couple hosted a book party for the author Jonathan Haidt, which was attended by Kardashian, John Legend, and Tom Hanks; Weiss moderated the evening’s conversation. Matthew Continetti, a conservative columnist at the Free Press, is rumored to be in the running to become the Post’s next opinion editor. Katherine Mangu-Ward, the editor of Reason, a libertarian monthly, has also been interviewed for the job. (Reason’s slogan is “Free Minds and Free Markets.”) Watford told me, “I’m really excited about being very transparent about what the opinion pages will stand for.”\nIn April, Bezos sent Sánchez, a licensed helicopter pilot, to space for eleven minutes on the first all-female space mission since 1963. That same month, the U.S. Space Force announced that it had awarded the largest share of its launch contracts, worth nearly six billion dollars, to Elon Musk’s SpaceX. Musk, the head of Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency, has overseen a chaotic and unprecedented slashing of federal jobs and programs, and has also expressed skepticism about the need to send spacecraft to the moon. Blue Origin has a $3.4-billion contract to build and test a lunar lander for NASA.\nThe Post, despite an exodus of high-profile talent, has remained competitive during the second Trump Administration, breaking stories on DOGE and the excesses of the White House’s immigration crackdown. As a longtime Post reporter told me, “There’s just something really freaking heroic about this group that is nailing exclusives while so many editors and role models have gone.”\nIn May, the Post won two Pulitzer Prizes, including one for the work of the editorial cartoonist Ann Telnaes. Telnaes had resigned in January, after her sketch of a group of tech and media moguls, including Bezos, prostrating themselves before Trump was rejected. (In a statement, Shipley said that the sketch was turned down because the paper had already assigned two columns about the same subject. “The only bias was against repetition,” he said.) Lewis didn’t show up to the Pulitzer announcement in the newsroom. Murray told the assembled staff that he was away on a long-planned trip.\nFor Bezos, being on Trump’s good side has its benefits. Back in 2017, Trump tweeted that Amazon’s arrangement with the Postal Service was “making Amazon richer and the Post Office dumber and poorer.” Recently, the Post reported that a leading candidate for Postmaster General had been the head of a trade group that represents Amazon. After Trump announced a new round of steep tariffs on China and other U.S. trading partners, Amazon was reportedly considering a feature that would reveal how much the policy increased the prices of goods. Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, called the move a “hostile and political act.” Bezos and Trump soon spoke. “I asked him about it,” Trump told NBC’s Kristen Welker. “He said, ‘Well, I don’t want to do that,’ and he took it off immediately.” The Trump Administration now has the authority to settle the F.T.C.’s case against Amazon, which is scheduled to go to trial in October, 2026.\nThere has been some speculation that Bezos might sell the Post, but he recently told one interested buyer that it is not for sale. “He doesn’t really care what people think of him,” Baron, the former executive editor, told me. Last year, after deciding to block the paper’s endorsement, Bezos wrote, “You can see my wealth and business interests as a bulwark against intimidation, or you can see them as a web of conflicting interests. Only my own principles can tip the balance from one to the other. I assure you that my views here are, in fact, principled.” Still, he added, “you are of course free to make your own determination.” ♦","summary":"How the paper that brought down Richard Nixon is struggling to survive the second term of Donald Trump.","url":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/05/26/is-jeff-bezos-selling-out-the-washington-post","image":"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/681e4fc89abd8a604b22cfa7/16:9/w_2400,h_1350,c_limit/r46678.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-12 10:00:00","author":"Clare Malone","authors":["Clare Malone"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.038},{"id":320456302,"title":"Fox News’ Greg Gutfeld on Trump, the Manosphere, and Hosting the “Strangest Game Show Ever”","text":"The rapid-fire, often mind-boggling nature of the Donald Trump news cycle is an asset to Gutfeld in putting contestants through the paces on What Did I Miss?, his zany new Fox Nation game show. The streaming program, which will have a three-episode run starting on May 12, is also something of a social experiment, featuring four people who have opted to remain in complete isolation from Inauguration Day until mid-April, with no media consumption or contact with the outside world. They’re welcomed back into society by coming face-to-face with Gutfeld and a live studio audience for a showdown to see who is best at separating actual news stories from bogus ones.\nI recently caught up with the busy Fox News personality as he was in a car traveling from the network’s Midtown headquarters, where he cohosts The Five and late-night show Gutfeld!, to his home in the city. I was curious if Gutfeld, beyond making the show for its pure entertainment factor, was trying to drive home a larger point about the credibility of the news media. “Not a lot of deep thinking” was involved in the making of the show, says Gutfeld, who adds: “I think you can draw conclusions that in this world, it’s hard to tell what’s real and what’s not.”\nGutfeld, a former top editor at Men’s Health, Stuff, and Maxim UK, and a TV host who mixed comedy with conservative politics on his old wee-hours Fox News show, Red Eye, arguably blazed a trail for today’s manosphere, which we discussed, along with why he considers it “incredibly healthy” to question the legitimacy of the media; how Fox News fits into that equation; and, of course, Trump. Gutfeld, a Trump supporter, says that as far as politics and entertainment go, the president didn’t just blur the line—“he erased it.”\nThis conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\nVanity Fair: I watched the first screener, and you called it the “strangest game show ever created.” I have to know—where did the idea come from, and how involved were you in shaping the format?\nGreg Gutfeld: We had a couple of meetings on it, and I think originally we wanted to do it before the election because we thought the big question would be who becomes president. But these things take forever, so we ended up doing it in the new year. The contestants went in on Inauguration Day. Fox approached me with the idea, and I was like, I can’t believe this hasn’t been done before. It combined the reality show feel with a game show. And the idea that we get to make stuff up is fun too.\nWas it meant to be purely funny, or was there an intention to say something deeper about the insanity of the news cycle or the media?\nI think that’s a byproduct. It was just, Let’s do it. The concept itself didn’t need any heavy thinking. It was like, These people are going to miss the news; let’s talk about the news. And it just so happens that we live in a time where we have a president that’s making news every day, and some of it is just unreal, and some of it is unbelievable. That just added to the charm of it. Whatever you saw there was just us having fun, not a lot of deep thinking. But I think you can draw conclusions that in this world, it’s hard to tell what’s real and what’s not.\nThe term fake news is used a lot in the show, and Trump has used that for years to attack the mainstream media. Are you deploying the phrase in the same way here? And also, do you agree with him doing that?\nI’ve been on both sides of the pen. I’ve been an editor and a writer for, I don’t know, it might have been 15 years before I got into TV, maybe even longer. I do believe it’s healthy not to trust the media. I think the concept of fake news, or calling the news fake, is incredibly healthy for people to understand that they should not be believing everything or anything they read.\nAnd I assume that goes for Fox as well?\nI think Fox is really great about presenting both sides. If you look at something like The Five, I think we’re the only show that does that. We also do something that neither CNN or MSNBC do, which is, we label our views and our commentators. When I’m talking, I’ve got an opinion. I’m not a reporter; I’m a guy with an opinion, sitting around a table like I’m at a bar. We don’t pretend to be anything else.\nWhat do you see as your role at Fox? Are you a comedian, a political commentator? A mix of both?\nI’m basically doing whatever I feel like doing. People ask my opinion, and I give it. Sometimes it’s serious, sometimes it’s funny, sometimes it’s bold. I never ever said I was a comedian, because I’ve never performed as a comedian. I was an editor and a writer for many years. I’ve always felt that I was a writer first. So basically, I’m just a guy who likes to talk and has a good time doing it.\nHave you ever been told by anyone at Fox, executives or producers, to tone it down or avoid certain topics?\nNever. I’ve never had anyone tell me to change an opinion at all. The only times might be about language, if I get a little too coarse. But that’s tiny, and it doesn’t affect me. I usually just do it. I think people have learned not to give me guidance, because I always end up leaning into the opposite.\nDo you think your success is a signal of how audiences are changing and how they want to consume news in this era?\nWell, I think it was there for the taking. All I did was comment on what I saw. A brutal honesty about the world is necessary. I’m probably the harshest critic on media and I’m in media. I think that’s healthy.\nWhat are your thoughts about the role of comedy in politics right now? People like Elon Musk have said something to the degree of “legalize comedy.” Do you agree with that sentiment? Is comedy under threat?\nI think people self-censored each other. They were worried that they would lose gigs or would lose their status. The late-night shows were very careful to stick to one side because that was the prevailing assumptions of the industry they’re in. The proof is in the explosion of people like Joe Rogan, Shane Gillis, Theo Von, and me. It’s like people needed it.\nIt was very sad to watch comedians have to walk back things they said in the past, which is the most absurd practice ever. It was pathetic and cowardly when comedians would do that.\nYou mentioned people like Joe Rogan. Do you see yourself in that world of media, which many are calling “the manosphere”?\nI don’t know because I’ve never aimed for anything. I’ve always done my thing and let the world—the entertainment consumption—come to me. I think things just happen, and then the media struggles to find a way to describe it so it makes sense to them. They’ll dismiss it—“Oh, it’s the manosphere.” We were discussing Vanity Fair and their piece on how protein is part of the manosphere. Why is everything healthy now a part of MAGA? Why are you giving that up? It was like, Fitness is now conservative. No, it wasn’t. Why are you politicizing it? [Editor’s note: Thanks for reading, Greg!] You’re going to end up on the outside of that, doesn’t do anybody any favors. There should be more liberal podcasts. Why isn’t there? I don’t know. I think it’s more of an organic thing that just happened, rather than me choosing it.\nSpeaking to MAGA, do you personally think Trump is good for the country?\nOh, awesome. Definitely.\nDid you vote for him?\nYeah, I voted for him. He’s the first nonpolitician that I’ve ever seen. He’s probably the most persuasive leader I’ve seen. He’s also, I would say, apolitical. I have conservative friends who are appalled by his trade stance. But my argument with Trump? You have to accept the total package because there’s so many good things in it that you’re bound to be upset by one thing or another.\nDo you have a personal relationship with him at all?\nI know him and I’ve met with him more than a few times. We talk infrequently. I guess I would say I have a relationship with him, but I wouldn’t want to overplay it. He’s done my show a couple of times and we get along. I was very critical of him for a long time, but I changed.\nWhere would you say you sit on the political spectrum? Do you identify with the Republican Party?\nI kind of outgrew the whole party thing, and I feel like it’s a mono-party, which is why Trump is attractive—because he’s outside the mono-party.\nI always felt that I was a libertarian, but I’m coming to question that. I’ve always been for the decriminalization of drugs, and maybe I still am, but I have to be honest with myself. I look at the streets of New York and LA and other cities. Was that a good idea? Can I still hold on to those beliefs, seeing what it’s done to the nature of how we live in these cities?\nYou said that you see Trump as apolitical in a way, but I think some would argue that there’s a blurring of the lines between politics and entertainment.\nHe just happens to be very entertaining and persuasive, and he likes to get shit done. That pretty much muscles out the politics. I don’t see him as a political animal at all. I’ve been around enough politicians. I can see why they have so much discomfort with him, because he’s an entertainer and a persuader and a businessman who entered their world, and he doesn’t go by their rules, and that has made them uncomfortable.\nIt’s not the blurring of the lines. I think he erased it.\nAnd you see that as a positive?\nDefinitely. Politicians suck. They’re designed to employ language to obscure truth. He doesn’t do that. He uses the language we use. He’s the most transparent leader I’ve ever seen.\nYou want to know what he’s thinking? Ask him. He’s going to tell you and he’s not going to shut up. He’s the opposite of every politician. They’re all so careful about what they’re going to say. It’s funny that people are critical of him for basically having the time and generosity to tell you everything, so much you might not even like him. But he doesn’t care; he’s just going to tell you. That is a tremendous respect for people that he tells you what he thinks. I’d take that over a politician any day—left, right, you name it.\nThose are pretty big shoes to fill. Who could possibly be next?\nThat’s the question. It could be somebody on the left because, like you said, those lines, they don’t really exist anymore. [Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez] has been pushed because she does have charisma, and that matters. I honestly don’t know. He’s kind of broken the mold.\nWhat does your media diet look like?\nWhen I get up in the morning, I work out to podcasts. I will listen to Scott Adams. He’s the guy behind “Dilbert.” I’ll listen to the All-In podcast. I will see who was on Lex Fridman. I love Tim Dillon’s podcast, which is always great. I’ll go on YouTube and look for the people that I’m interested in, whether it’s Peter Thiel being interviewed or—I don’t listen to short-form stuff. I don’t get news that way. I deliver it in that way, but I like listening to people who are interesting talk about stuff. Could be Jordan Peterson one day. I like Bret Weinstein and his wife, Heather; it’s called the DarkHorse Podcast. They talk about biology and social issues, and I find that really interesting. I obviously always check Rogan. I listen to Red Scare because they’re really funny.\nThe left has been behind in this because they don’t trust themselves to go beyond a sound bite. I think that’s why Kamala [Harris], they were fighting so hard to keep her off Joe Rogan because they didn’t trust that she could do it. Whereas Trump sat down and went, like, for two and a half hours. They couldn’t trust her to go beyond what the handlers wanted her to do.\nI think you’re going to know who that person is. Maybe it is Stephen A. Smith. Somebody who could talk and is not afraid of taking a risk on an idea. You have to take risks for people to trust you, to be authentic. You’ve got to defend some people. And I think the left got too scared of the woke to actually defend themselves against the woke. I think there’s going to be a push away from identity politics. That’s going to be a really healthy thing for the Democratic Party to start thinking about.\nAre you still living in New York City? I’m curious if you have any thoughts on the mayoral race?\nYeah, I’m still living in the city. I don’t know what to make of it. To be honest with you, I have a feeling that it’s probably going to be [Andrew] Cuomo, if he wants it. I do know that whoever is tough on crime is going to win.\nAny closing thoughts on Cuomo?\nHe’s got some baggage, but desperate times, you know—people may overlook that baggage, whether it was the COVID rest home stuff or the sexual harassment. [Cuomo has denied all allegations against him.] People are worried about walking to work, using the subway. I think we need to get the citizens to regain confidence that they can go outside and use the subway without worrying.\nI’m pulling up!\nJust in time.","summary":"The cohost of The Five and star of Gutfeld! talks to VF about his off-the-wall new game show, What Did I Miss?, in which contestants held in monthslong isolation are challenged to distinguish between real and fake news.","url":"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/fox-news-greg-gutfeld-on-trump-game-show","image":"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/681e4235edef886138e70fbd/16:9/w_2000,h_1125,c_limit/greg-gutfeld-fox-news.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-12 10:00:00","author":"Natalie Korach","authors":["Natalie Korach"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.084},{"id":320438748,"title":"Trump's attacks on transgender Americans are a test in California's governor's race","text":"In a ballroom packed with more than 1,000 people raising money for LGBTQ+ youths, veteran California legislative leader Toni Atkins didn't mince words: To be a gay or transgender teenager right now, she said, must feel like \"a rug has been pulled from beneath your feet.\" In her fiery speech at the annual Harvey Milk Diversity Breakfast, Atkins, who is running for California governor, said President Trump and other Republicans are working to \"legislate our trans siblings out of public life.\" \"These aren't just political stunts: These are acts that put lives in danger and strip away basic human dignity,\" Atkins said. \"So hear me, as I say: Trans people belong. Trans youth deserve love, joy and our protection.\" Atkins' speech, which drew rousing applause, offered a glimpse of how Trump's efforts to undermine California's liberal values — including support for transgender Americans — will be at the heart of the state's 2026 campaign for governor. In his first 100 days, Trump issued executive orders banning trans women from women's sports and barring the federal government from recognizing genders other than male or female. Trump is also pushing to ban transgender Americans from the U.S. military, writing in an executive order that transgender identity is a \"falsehood\" inconsistent with the \"humility and selflessness required of a service member.\" The Supreme Court cleared the way last week for that ban to take effect. \"Cruelty, and an attempt to humiliate, seems to be the point of what they are doing,\" said Lisa Middleton, a transgender woman and former mayor of Palm Springs. The LGBTQ+ community has become a political force in shaping statewide policy and campaigns. Other top Democrats running to replace Gov. Gavin Newsom have also voiced strong support for LGBTQ+ rights, including Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis, former Orange County Rep. Katie Porter, former U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, former Controller Betty Yee and Supt. of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond. About 2.8 million lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people live in California, more than in any other state, and Californians overwhelmingly support laws that protect the LGBTQ+ community, according to the Public Policy Institute of California. Last year, California voters overwhelming passed a ballot measure to enshrine the right to same-sex marriage into the state Constitution. A proposed ballot initiative that would have limited transgender youth medical care and required schools to notify parents about their child’s gender identity failed to get enough signatures to qualify for the November ballot. Polling by the Los Angeles Times last year found that more than 3 in 4 Americans see issues related to transgender and nonbinary people — which affect a fraction of the American population — as a distraction from more pressing policy matters. \"It is a trap that conservatives are utilizing to distract from the real issues at hand,\" said Evan Low, a former California Assembly member and the new president of the LGBTQ+ Victory Fund. Atkins, a former state Senate president pro tempore, former Assembly speaker and the only gay major candidate in the governor's race, said in an interview that she's \"mindful that as a woman and as a member of the gay community, what I do matters.\" She said she supported the bill passed by the California Legislature a decade ago that allows students to play on sports teams that match their gender identity. \"This administration is using that as a weapon and politicizing it,\" Atkins said. \"That's just cruel.\" An Associated Press poll found in early May that Trump's handling of transgender issues is more popular with Americans than his job performance overall. And polling done in January by the New York Times found that nearly 80% of Americans, including more than two-thirds of Democrats, opposed the idea of trans women competing in women's sports. \"The Democrats, who are trying to find their voice on so many things right now, don't know how to handle it,\" said Hank Plante, a political journalist and former fellow at the USC Center for the Political Future who lives in Palm Springs with his husband. \"They want to be true to their base and to their principles of equal rights. But at the same time, it's a loser politically when you start talking about nonconforming gender issues and young people.\" One of the Trump campaign's most bruising attack ads last fall showed a clip of former Vice President Kamala Harris saying she would support gender-transition surgery for inmates in California's prisons, then concluded with: \"Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you.\" \"She didn't even react to it, which was even more devastating,\" Newsom said on a recent episode of his podcast. \"Brutal. It was a great ad.\" On the same episode, Newsom told conservative commentator Charlie Kirk that it was \"deeply unfair\" for transgender girls to play on girls' sports teams. Newsom previously supported a California law signed by former Gov. Jerry Brown that allowed trans students to compete in sports and use bathrooms based on their gender preference. The uproar that followed Newsom's comments underscored the complexities Democrats face on the issue, with some Democrats alleging that Newsom strategically abandoned a vulnerable group of people to prepare for a future presidential run. Assemblymember Christopher M. Ward (D-San Diego), the chair of the California Legislative LGBTQ Caucus, said the governor's remarks left him \"profoundly sickened and frustrated.\" But Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco, one of the best-known Republicans running for governor, said he agreed with Newsom — and, if elected, would sign an executive order banning \"boys competing in girls' sports.\" Ron deHarte, the first gay Mexican American mayor of Palm Springs, warned in his speech at the Harvey Milk Diversity Breakfast that the LGBTQ+ community and its allies will \"march with greater fervor — we will do more than ever before.\" \"If you are a member of the military — transgender or not — if you are willing to fight for me, then I must be willing to fight for you,\" deHarte told the crowd. In an interview, deHarte said that elected officials are now facing an ethical test over whether to speak out against Trump administration policies that they see as hurting their communities, at the risk of losing federal funding. He said all eyes are on Maine, where the Trump administration stopped all federal education funding after Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, refused to comply with Trump's directive to ban trans girls from girls' sports. \"It's a challenging line to walk,\" deHarte said. \"You have to make sure you have not only the right moral standing, but the right legal standing too.\" Since Trump's inauguration, federal officials have targeted California over laws aimed at protecting trans students. The U.S. Department of Education is investigating the California Interscholastic Federation, which oversees sports at more than 1,500 high schools, and the California Department of Education over a law that bars schools from automatically notifying families about issues related to students' gender identities. Gay and trans high school students right now are experiencing fear that is \"like being a little more closeted,\" said Delana Martin-Marshall, 38, an art teacher at A.B. Miller High School in Fontana. She and her wife, a physical education teacher at the school, drove a dozen students from the school's gay-straight alliance in two vans to the Harvey Milk Diversity Breakfast. \"Students are really scared,\" she said. \"Scared of being themselves.\" There's little that state-level officials can do to reverse decisions from the White House on issues like military eligibility and passports, but the state can still be a refuge for gay and trans students, attendees said, including shoring up funding and legal protections for gender nonconforming students and for gay couples. \"The state has to prepare for what's coming,\" Plante said. He pointed to Justice Clarence Thomas' concurring opinion when the Supreme Court overturned Roe vs. Wade, which said that the court \"should reconsider\" past rulings codifying Americans' rights to contraception, same-sex relationships and same-sex marriage. Christopher Martinez, 32, attended the Harvey Milk Diversity Breakfast with fellow students from College of the Desert who said they hope the next governor will focus on the day-to-day issues that affect transgender and gay college students, including the rising cost of living and housing insecurity. “Everything is getting really expensive,” Martinez said.","summary":"Trump's efforts to undermine California's liberal values will be at the forefront of the state's 2026 campaign for governor, including on the culture-war fight over rights for transgender Americans.","url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2025-05-12/toni-atkins-governors-race-gay-lesbian-trans-issues-palm-springs","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/42719ff/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3600x1890+0+457/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F61%2F0f%2Fa297ca7f454ca60c326fc016fc95%2F1505284-me-gubernato","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-12 10:00:00","author":"Laura J.

But having no peaceful and democratic means at hand, we have to continue military operation.”\n\nHe would go on to say that U.S. and European weapon shipments to Kyiv would need to be halted for those talks to take place.\n\n\"Otherwise, it will be advantage for Ukraine. Ukraine will continue their total mobilization, bringing new troops to front line. Ukraine will use this period to train new military personnel and to give a rest to their existing ones,\" said Peskov. \"So why should we grant such an advantage to Ukraine?\"\n\nUkraine is \"not ready for immediate negotiations,\" he insisted.\n\nSeparately on ABC News, Ukrainian ambassador to the U.S. Oksana Markarova sat down in-studio for an interview with Raddatz. She shot down Peskov’s assertion that Ukraine was refusing the possibility of talks beginning at once.\n\n“President Zelensky today already said that, yes, Ukraine is ready to negotiate,” Markarova said. Ukraine has set a temporary ceasefire as a condition for talks to take place. Russia, meanwhile, said that it would not accept the presence of European peacekeeping forces.\n\n“We have heard loud and clear from President Trump that ceasefires should be full and unconditional. And we have heard from other European leaders,” she continued. “Nobody wants peace more than Ukraine. The question of the day is whether Russia wants it.”\n\nPresident Donald Trump spent much of 2024 hammering his two opponents, Joe Biden and later Kamala Harris, for the Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Palestine conflicts, which he says started under their watch. The 47th president claimed often that Putin would not have dared to launch an invasion of Ukraine in 2022 had he been in office, and boasted as well that he could end the eastern European conflict in a matter of hours.\n\nThose hours have stretched into weeks as Trump has come to publicly grumble that Russia may be stringing his administration along in the hopes of securing a more advantageous position on the battlefield. The U.S. president has threatened damaging sanctions against Moscow if the conflict continues, but has yet to act on those threats.\n\nAfter an Oval Office blow-up between the two men earlier this year, Trump met Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelensky on the sidelines of Pope Francis’s funeral in the Vatican in late April. Soon after the meeting, he posted his suspicions of Russia’s aims on Truth Social.\n\n“There was no reason for Putin to be shooting missiles into civilian areas, cities and towns, over the last few days,” Trump wrote. “It makes me think that maybe he doesn’t want to stop the war, he’s just tapping me along.”\n\nOn Sunday, Trump condemned the “bloodbath” in another Truth Social posting and urged Zelensky to accept an invitation for talks in Turkey with Putin scheduled for this coming Thursday. Zelensky, along with a coalition of NATO leaders, presented the U.S. with a pledge on Saturday stating that Ukraine would accept an immediate temporary ceasefire and to begin talks with Russia. Putin, in his response, accepted an invitation to negotiate while refusing to agree to an immediate ceasefire.\n\n“President Putin of Russia doesn’t want to have a Cease Fire Agreement with Ukraine, but rather wants to meet on Thursday, in Turkey, to negotiate a possible end to the BLOODBATH. Ukraine should agree to this, IMMEDIATELY,” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post. At least they will be able to determine whether or not a deal is possible, and if it is not, European leaders, and the U.S., will know where everything stands, and can proceed accordingly!”\n\n“I’m starting to doubt that Ukraine will make a deal with Putin, who’s too busy celebrating the Victory of World War ll, which could not have been won (not even close!) without the United States of America,” he continued. “HAVE THE MEETING, NOW!!!”\n\nZelensky accepted, responding in his own post to Twitter.\n\n“We await a full and lasting ceasefire, starting from tomorrow, to provide the necessary basis for diplomacy,” he said. “There is no point in prolonging the killings. And I will be waiting for Putin in Türkiye on Thursday. Personally. I hope that this time the Russians will not look for excuses.”","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/putin-spokesman-says-moscow-continue-222244027.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/e4a9b801638caee732bf8426b25345ed","video":"","publish_date":"2025-05-12 01:01:20","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.336},{"id":320287606,"title":"Klobuchar tells NBC she wants to 'move forward,' not dwell on the past, when pressed on Biden comments","text":"Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., rebuffed two questions on Sunday about former President Biden's remarks in multiple interviews this week, arguing that the party should be moving forward rather than looking back on where they went wrong in 2024. NBC's \"Meet the Press\" host Kristen Welker asked the senator about Biden blaming Harris' loss on sexism and racism. Pressed on whether the lesson Democrats will take from the 2024 election is that they shouldn't put a woman at the top of the ticket, Klobuchar rejected the idea. \"I hope not. You have seen women run other countries quite well. Angela Merkel comes to mind in Germany. And you’ve also seen women in the U.S., incredible mayors, incredible governors. I look in the Senate for Democrats in the last election — three of the four races where we beat the presidential ticket were women running in Michigan, women running in Nevada, women running in Wisconsin. I mean, this happens. So I just, I don’t think that’s a lesson to learn. I know it’s not easy running as a woman. If it was, we could play the game, pick your favorite woman president. You can’t,\" Klobuchar said. The Democratic lawmaker said the party shouldn't be looking backwards. CNN'S SCOTT JENNINGS BREAKS DOWN LAUGHING AT ‘VIEW’ HOST NAVARRO's CLAIM BIDEN ‘DOESN’T TELL MANY LIES' \"But I think the president understands there’s been sexism — President Biden does — but to me, I just want to move forward, and we’ve got incredible candidates across the board running at all levels of government, so let's work on helping the American people, instead of looking backwards. Instead of looking at what happened years ago, I want to look at the now, and people need our help,\" she said. Earlier in the discussion, Welker asked about Biden's insistance that it didn't matter that he dropped out of the race in July, only giving former Vice President Kamala Harris about 90 days to campaign. \"You know, everything we look at in a rearview mirror after you lose an election. Yes, we would have been served better by a primary, but we are where we are. We’re not on the history channel right now, and I believe that President Biden can come out and speak and do interviews whenever he wants, but I will say this. We’re not in the ‘History Channel’ and our Republican colleagues, instead of dealing with where we are now, think they’re in some kind of a way back zone, that they can go bring time backwards and blame everything on Joe Biden. Donald Trump is the president right now, and we have to deal with helping the American people,\" Klobuchar said.

Before eating, they prayed. Once a common sight, it’s now rare.\n\nIf America is to have a future, this family points the way.\n\nFinally, there is a consensus that we are in the midst of a fertility crisis, which some call “Demographic Winter.”\n\nIn 2023, America’s total fertility rate, the number of children the average woman will have in her lifetime, was 1.6, well below the replacement rate of 2.1. Our fertility rate has been at replacement only one year in the past half-century. In the not-too-distant future, population decline will begin.\n\nThe fall of fertility is a worldwide phenomenon.\n\nChina’s total fertility rate is 1.0. Japan’s is 1.26. Germany’s is 1.4. By 2040, every region on earth will have below-replacement fertility.\n\nYou can’t have a modern industrial society without robust population growth. Tesla Chairman Elon Musk says, “Civilization is going to crumble if people don’t have more children.” An aging population will impact everything, including pensions, tax revenue, the workforce and defense.\n\nPresident Trump understands this well. During the campaign, he promised: “We will support baby booms, and we will support baby bonuses.”\n\nMr. Musk says: “Instead of teaching fear of pregnancy” — that if a woman has children her life will be over — “we should teach fear of childlessness.”\n\nThe left’s response is typically loopy.\n\nWriting in The New York Times, the chronically aggrieved Michelle Goldberg whines that Mr. Trump’s “crude chauvinism” is a major impediment to “the creation of healthy families.” Compared with this, former Vice President Kamala Harris’ ode to a yellow school bus makes sense.\n\nThere is no shortage of proposed solutions to the birth dearth.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal wants more immigration, which won’t increase fertility but will help depress wages, which is all corporate America really cares about.\n\nMr. Trump says a $5,000 baby bonus “sounds like a good idea.” In 2016, Russia offered a baby bonus equal to its annual per capita income for a family’s second child. The result was negligible.\n\nAn analyst for The Heritage Foundation recommends longer parental leave and subsidized child care. Have more children so they can be raised by strangers?\n\nThrowing money at the problem has been tried repeatedly in Hungary, Russia, Japan and South Korea. The results are mixed at best.\n\nSubsidies can’t overcome a culture that conspires against procreation.\n\nMore people are remaining single, choosing the dreamland of cyberspace over real relationships. Increasingly, those who do marry don’t want children. The percentage of adults without children who say they will never have them increased from 14% in 2002 to 29% in 2023.\n\nThe most ominous trend driving falling fertility is the loss of faith. It also points to a way to extricate ourselves from the quagmire.\n\nTwo decades ago, 42% of U.S. adults said they attended religious services weekly. Ten years later, it was 38%. Now, it’s 30%.\n\nThink about who’s having children: traditional Catholics, evangelicals, Hasidic Jews, Mormons and the Amish, whose fertility rate is eight to 10.\n\nWhat do they have in common? They take the Bible seriously. They believe the First Commandment to “Be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth” was never repealed. Faith is the invisible hand that rocks the cradle.\n\nWhat, then, should natalists do? Buy a tambourine and join a Salvation Army band?\n\nWe need to encourage a revival, with subsidies for religious schools and a more positive portrayal of people of faith in the news and entertainment media.\n\nSomething as mundane as the president posting videos of Bible reading and prayer in the White House at Easter would help, instead of his predecessor celebrating Transgender Visibility Day.\n\nWhen Mr. Trump signed an executive order stating the federal government recognizes only two sexes, he was affirming Genesis.\n\nA few states have enacted laws requiring the posting of the Ten Commandments in public schools.

But having no peaceful and democratic means at hand, we have to continue military operation.”\n\nHe would go on to say that U.S. and European weapon shipments to Kyiv would need to be halted for those talks to take place.\n\n\"Otherwise, it will be advantage for Ukraine. Ukraine will continue their total mobilization, bringing new troops to front line. Ukraine will use this period to train new military personnel and to give a rest to their existing ones,\" said Peskov. \"So why should we grant such an advantage to Ukraine?\"\n\nUkraine is \"not ready for immediate negotiations,\" he insisted.\n\nSeparately on ABC News, Ukrainian ambassador to the U.S. Oksana Markarova sat down in-studio for an interview with Raddatz. She shot down Peskov’s assertion that Ukraine was refusing the possibility of talks beginning at once.\n\n“President Zelensky today already said that, yes, Ukraine is ready to negotiate,” Markarova said. Ukraine has set a temporary ceasefire as a condition for talks to take place. Russia, meanwhile, said that it would not accept the presence of European peacekeeping forces.\n\n“We have heard loud and clear from President Trump that ceasefires should be full and unconditional. And we have heard from other European leaders,” she continued. “Nobody wants peace more than Ukraine. The question of the day is whether Russia wants it.”\n\nPresident Donald Trump spent much of 2024 hammering his two opponents, Joe Biden and later Kamala Harris, for the Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Palestine conflicts, which he says started under their watch. The 47th president claimed often that Putin would not have dared to launch an invasion of Ukraine in 2022 had he been in office, and boasted as well that he could end the eastern European conflict in a matter of hours.\n\nThose hours have stretched into weeks as Trump has come to publicly grumble that Russia may be stringing his administration along in the hopes of securing a more advantageous position on the battlefield. The U.S. president has threatened damaging sanctions against Moscow if the conflict continues, but has yet to act on those threats.\n\nAfter an Oval Office blow-up between the two men earlier this year, Trump met Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelensky on the sidelines of Pope Francis’s funeral in the Vatican in late April. Soon after the meeting, he posted his suspicions of Russia’s aims on Truth Social.\n\n“There was no reason for Putin to be shooting missiles into civilian areas, cities and towns, over the last few days,” Trump wrote. “It makes me think that maybe he doesn’t want to stop the war, he’s just tapping me along.”\n\nOn Sunday, Trump condemned the “bloodbath” in another Truth Social posting and urged Zelensky to accept an invitation for talks in Turkey with Putin scheduled for this coming Thursday. Zelensky, along with a coalition of NATO leaders, presented the U.S. with a pledge on Saturday stating that Ukraine would accept an immediate temporary ceasefire and to begin talks with Russia. Putin, in his response, accepted an invitation to negotiate while refusing to agree to an immediate ceasefire.\n\n“President Putin of Russia doesn’t want to have a Cease Fire Agreement with Ukraine, but rather wants to meet on Thursday, in Turkey, to negotiate a possible end to the BLOODBATH. Ukraine should agree to this, IMMEDIATELY,” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post. At least they will be able to determine whether or not a deal is possible, and if it is not, European leaders, and the U.S., will know where everything stands, and can proceed accordingly!”\n\n“I’m starting to doubt that Ukraine will make a deal with Putin, who’s too busy celebrating the Victory of World War ll, which could not have been won (not even close!) without the United States of America,” he continued. “HAVE THE MEETING, NOW!!!”\n\nZelensky accepted, responding in his own post to Twitter.\n\n“We await a full and lasting ceasefire, starting from tomorrow, to provide the necessary basis for diplomacy,” he said. “There is no point in prolonging the killings. And I will be waiting for Putin in Türkiye on Thursday. Personally. I hope that this time the Russians will not look for excuses.”","summary":"Talks tentatively set for Thursday in Turkey as Trump seeks conclusion to war he promised he could end in 24 hours","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/russia-ukraine-ceasefire-trump-peace-talks-b2748920.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/11/21/00/peskov_abc_525.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-11 22:22:44","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.336},{"id":320268438,"title":"Crockett suggests Democrats looking to run 'safest White boy' in 2028, hints at specific candidate","text":"Rep.

Meanwhile, Vance is seen by many as the most likely Republican to follow Trump, who is term-limited and can't technically run for a third term.Although Trump and some of his allies have repeatedly teased the idea of him seeking an additional term, most constitutional experts believe this would not be possible unless the Constitution is officially changed, which would be an all but impossible process given current political dynamics.What To KnowNo Democratic politician has declared an intention to run for president yet, but most analysts speculate that some of the leading contenders in 2028 would be Harris, Ocasio-Cortez, former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, California Governor Gavin Newsom and Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey.Polling aggregation site Race to the WH currently shows Harris, who lost to Trump in 2024, leading the pack with a polling average of 27.2 percent. She is followed by Ocasio-Cortez in second at 15.9 percent, Buttigieg in third at 12.8 percent, Booker is fourth at 8.6 percent and Newsom is fifth at 7.1 percent.Donald Trump's PopularityThe president's popularity rating currently stands at 43 percent in the first quarter of 2025, according to YouGov's latest data. Popularity is measured by YouGov as a percentage of people who have a positive opinion of a given politician.Trump is disliked by 40 percent of people, which means his popularity rating is 3 points above water. An additional 11 percent have a neutral opinion.The data also shows that Trump ranks as the 10th most popular politician in the country, below Harris and Ocasio-Cortez, but above Buttigieg, Newsom and Booker. He is the third most popular Republican, with California's former Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger ranked No. 1 followed by former President George W. Bush in second.YouGov's polling data for Trump aligns closely with Gallup, which had Trump's approval rating at 44 percent as of April. The average for Trump' second term thus far, according to Gallup, is 45 percent.JD Vance's PopularityThe vice president is less popular than the president, according to YouGov. Just 39 percent of people have a positive view of Vance compared to 42 percent who dislike him—meaning his popularity is negative 3 points. An additional 14 percent have a neutral view.Although Vance ranks as the 4th most popular Republican, he is only the 17th most popular politician overall. That places him below all the leading potential 2028 Democratic contenders except for Booker.Kamala Harris' PopularityThe former vice president is significantly more popular than Trump and Vance, with a popularity rating double-digits above water. Harris is popular with 55 percent of respondents, compared to 31 percent who dislike her—giving her a positive rating of 24 points. An additional 13 percent have a neutral view.Notably, Harris is the third most popular Democratic politician—after former Presidents Jimmy Carter, who died last year, and Barack Obama, respectively. Overall, she is the 4th most popular U.S. politician, with Carter coming at No. 1, followed by Obama and then Schwarzenegger in third.Pete Buttigieg's PopularityButtigieg's popularity rating is significantly above water, although the percentage of people who have a positive view of the former Biden administration official is slightly lower than for Trump, while higher than Vance.According to YouGov, Buttigieg popularity stands at 41 percent. Meanwhile, just 21 percent say they dislike him, giving him a positive rating of 20 points. An additional 16 percent have a neutral view.Buttigieg ranks as the 14th most popular politician overall, and as the 11th most popular Democrat. Among the potential 2028 Democratic candidates, that places him third after Harris and Ocasio-Cortez, respectively.Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's PopularityThe New York progressive is more popular than Trump and Vance. Ocasio-Cortez's popularity rating stands at 45 percent, while just 24 percent dislike her—meaning her popularity is 21 points above water. An additional 15 percent view her neutrally.The congresswoman is ranked as the sixth most popular Democrat, and the eight most popular politician overall. This places her second among the leading potential 2028 candidates after Harris.Gavin Newsom's PopularityThe California governor's popularity rating is tied with that of Vance, but below Trump. Thirty-nine percent of people have a positive view of Newsom while 24 percent said they disliked him, which means his rating is above water by 15 points. An additional 19 percent viewed him neutrally.He ranks 13th among Democrats and 16th among politicians overall. That places him below Trump and one spot above Vance.Cory Booker's PopularityThe senator from New Jersey has a popularity rating of 37 percent, while 16 percent said they dislike him. That puts Booker's popularity below Vance and Trump, although his rating is also positive by 21 percent. A further 14 percent have a neutral view.Among Democrats, Booker ranks the lowest among the leading potential 2028 contenders, at 16th. He also ranks the lowest among politicians overall, coming in at 20th.What People Are SayingPresident Donald Trump when asked by Fox News in February if he saw Vance as his successor: \"No, but he's very capable. I think you have a lot of very capable people... So far, I think he's doing a fantastic job. It's too early, we're just starting.\"Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez when asked by Fox News about her 2028 plans in April: \"This moment isn't about campaigns, or elections, or about politics. It's about making sure people are protected, and we've got people that are getting locked up for exercising their First Amendment rights. We're getting 2-year-olds that are getting deported into cells in Honduras. We're getting people that are about to get kicked off of Medicaid. That, to me, is most important.\"Former Vice President Kamala Harris on the Trump administration last month: \"We all know President Trump and his administration, and their allies, are counting on the notion that fear can be contagious. They are counting on the notion that if they make some people afraid, it will have a chilling effect on others. But what they're overlooking, what they have overlooked is that fear is not the only thing that's contagious. Courage is contagious, the courage of Americans who are banding together...\"What Happens Next?Americans' views of the potential 2028 contenders are expected to shift substantially in the coming months as years. As of now, none have announced an intention to run, and voters will likely take a more serious look at candidates once they launch campaigns.","summary":"No Democratic candidate has yet declared an intention to run in 2028, but speculation continues to swirl.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/how-leading-2028-democrats-popularity-compares-trump-jd-vance-2070673","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2642462/aoc-vance-trump-buttigieg.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-11 20:25:24","author":"Jason Lemon","authors":["Jason Lemon"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.273},{"id":320275572,"title":"WATCH -- Jasmine Crockett: Democrats Supporting 'Safest White Boy' Prior to 2028 Election","text":"Rep.

Brooks told PBS NewsHour that if Joe Biden ever called him to ask what he should do with his post-presidency, he would tell the former president to \"be post-political, rise above it and don't get back in, don't try to fight old battle.\" Biden spoke to BBC and \"The View\" this week after the 2024 election, blaming former Vice President Kamala Harris' loss on sexism and racism.

Mike Lawler (R-NY), a fellow panelist on the overtime segment of “Real Time With Bill Maher,” noted that the Republican National Committee has a rule that when there’s a male chair, the vice chair has to be female. \n\nEarlier in the conversation, the panelists discussed murmurs that Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) may run for president in 2028 and groused over the hype about him potentially being the first Latino president. \n\nHogg similarly seemed displeased with the focus on identity politics and said the important factor should be, “Are you good at your job?”\n\nThe 25-year-old activist is at risk of losing his DNC vice chairmanship role over his plans to meddle in primaries. \n\nDNC chairman Ken Martin has opposed Hogg’s plans and called for top party brass to adhere to a neutrality policy.\n\n“Our job is to be neutral arbiters,” Martin told DNC members in a call last month. “We can’t be both the referee and also the player at the same time.”\n\nMartin has pushed to tweak party rules so that DNC officers are required to stay neutral in primaries. The DNC is expected to vote on that measure in August, which would force Hogg to make a decision about his future.\n\nLawler praised Hogg’s plans to intervene in primaries. \n\n“I can tell you, having been in politics for quite a while, as far as an intern for [John] McCain.

We’re getting those callers.”\n\nMajor donors are excited about “one specific candidate,” Crockett responded.\n\n“I had a donor on the phones with me, telling me that all the donors are lining up behind that candidate,” she said. “So I can tell, and I tell you, it’s not a Black person nor a woman.”\n\n“So they have, quote unquote, ‘they,’ have chosen,” she added. “When I say ‘they,; it’s the same donors that most likely had their opinions about Joe Biden and moved… So like, that would be the “they” that I would talk about.”\n\nCrockett didn’t reveal this candidate’s identity, but there are many predicted 2028 frontrunners who meet her description.\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom is term-limited and will leave office in 2027, so many expect a presidential campaign will follow. Other potential candidates include Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.\n\nMeanwhile, several other Democratic front-runners don’t meet Crockett’s description of the “safest white boy” possible, including the party’s last candidate, former Vice President Kamala Harris, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.","summary":"Crockett said Democrats have ‘this fear’ about voting for a woman again after Kamala Harris and Hillary Clinton lost","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/jasmine-crockett-democratic-candidate-2028-b2748800.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/11/14/34/SEI250505120.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-11 15:31:23","author":"Katie Hawkinson","authors":["Katie Hawkinson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.08},{"id":320193318,"title":"Lessons From Jasmine Crockett’s Communication And Leadership Styles","text":"Rep.

Jasmine Crockett (D-TX) could teach corporate executives about communication and leadership.\n\nLike Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Crockett is in the public spotlight thanks to what she says and how she says it. The increased media presence of the two lawmakers comes at a time when Democrats are looking for new and younger leaders to help re-brand the party.\n\nCrockett has shown that she can express herself in attention-getting and memorable ways, such as when spoke at the Democratic National Convention last year and said that “Kamala Harris has a resume. Donald Trump has a rap sheet.” She made headlines for the colorful way that she responded to disparaging remarks about her by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Green (R-GA) during a House committee hearing last year.\n\nIn a commencement speech last week at Tougaloo College, a historically Black college in Mississippi, she pointed out that “every significant social justice movement has been led by young people [and]\n\nnoted that she is now older than Medgar Evers, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and Malcolm X were when they were assassinated,” according to Diverse Education.” Crockett went on to say that “Your moment is not in the future. Your moment is now. This country is relying on each and every one of you to walk into your purpose and to walk in greatness with your head held high.”\n\nCrockett’s presentation and message resonated with the audience. “She was dynamic and passionate,\" according to Rose Lucas, whose niece was among the more than 120 undergraduates who heard the speech. \"At a time when so many of our politicians are afraid to speak out against the injustices in Washington, I am encouraged by the Congresswoman’s passion and commitment,” Diverse Education reported.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\niOS 18—Here’s Why There’s A New Black Dot On Your iPhone\n\nMicrosoft Confirms New Free Update Deadline For Windows Users\n\nLeak Reveals Mark Zuckerberg Is Quietly Plotting To Blow Up The Bitcoin Price And Crypto Market\n\nCrockett’s Jargon-Free Communication\n\nCrockett’s communication and leadership styles reflect her background, career and political experience. Her leadership style “combines her legal background with jargon-free political communication. She effortlessly integrates complex policy debates into everyday conversation. Her plain-spoken style keeps constituents engaged, while her legal acumen grounds every argument in statutes and the Constitution,” Jacqueline Twillie, a leadership and development expert, explained via an email interview.\n\nWhile corporate executives don’t have Crockett’s resume, they can learn from her that “clear audience-centered language is a strategic advantage. It builds trust, accelerates buy-in, and positions the leader as credible and approachable,” Twille observed.\n\nThe verbal skills of new and aspiring leaders can be instrumental in helping them to achieve their goals and attract new follower. “Crockett doesn’t just show up in spaces; she repositions the space around her. That’s a vital skill for any business leader navigating power dynamics, equity conversations, or high-stakes decision-making,”\n\nPatrice Williams-Lind0, CEO of Career Nomad, commented in an email message to me.\n\nAccording to her, there are the three things that business leaders can learn from Crockett’s communication style:\n\nCommand With Candor\n\n“Crockett communicates hard truths without shrinking. In corporate settings, leaders often water down bold messaging for the sake of comfort. Crockett proves you can lead with candor and earn credibility.”\n\nStrategic Disruption\n\n“She’s not chaotic; she’s calculated. Her responses are often grounded in data, constitutional knowledge, and emotional intelligence—essential tools in today’s climate of rapid change and polarized environments.”\n\nAuthenticity AsStrategy\n\n“Crockett’s hair, fashion, and tone are part of her brand—and that authenticity builds trust, especially among younger and more diverse audiences. Business leaders must recognize that visibility and relatability are no longer optional.”\n\nA Leadership Style Driven By Conviction And Values\n\nThe Texas legislator demonstrates how a leader’s values can be reflected in their actions and words “As a leader, she is very clear about her values and doesn’t sit in polite silence. She is changing the game by modeling what it looks like to lead by using your identity, your expertise, and your voice. This is extraordinary because in corporate America, there is a lot of pressure felt by Black women to conform and be silent,” Tamica Sears, an executive coach and HR consultant at Sears Coaching, noted in an email interview with me.\n\nWhile some politicians are more comfortable following the crowds, Crockett shows that she prefers to lead, rather than follow. Her leadership style is “unapologetically clear, anchored in truth, and driven by conviction—and that’s exactly the kind of leadership we need more of. She doesn’t lead to please; she leads to shift. She’s not here for pageantry or politicking—she’s here to push boundaries and speak for people who’ve been shut out of rooms for too long,” Angela Solomon, a leadership coach, observed via an email message to me.\n\nExecutives who aspire to lead companies and organizations would be well-served to closely study the character and characteristics of rising stars in different industries and professions, including politics. “Business leaders should be paying attention [to Crockett]. Her rise shows that clarity, courage, and cultural competence are not ‘nice-to-haves’—they’re leadership requirements in today’s world. When leaders show up as their full selves and speak with both heart and spine, they build trust, not just teams. They inspire followership rooted in authenticity, not fear,” Solomon concluded.\n\n“As a leader, Rep. Crockett is the embodiment of the shift that leadership has needed in politics and corporate America. She teaches at least three great leadership lessons that would help every business leader.” Sears of Sears Coaching noted.\n\n“Being a true leader is about advocating for people, speaking the truth, and leading with clarity.”\n\n“Leaders should hold each other accountable, as she does every time she speaks out about people on either side not staying true to their election promises.”\n\n“For true leaders, visibility is about being willing to take the heat for standing firm in your values, not just being seen providing lip service.”\n\n“As someone who doesn’t play it safe to maintain the [status] quo, Rep. Cockett proves that remaining true to yourself is true leadership. Her leadership style could be summed up as intelligence with integrity and intention,” Sears concluded.\n\nWhile it’s too soon to predict who will be the new face or faces of the Democratic Party, it’s not too early for company executives to start paying attention to the potential contenders and learning from their communication and leadership styles.\n\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

Right now, those people get a 32-pound box filled with items like cereal, canned soup and peanut butter each month. It’s unclear how or if those boxes will be delivered under the administration’s proposed replacement plan.\n\nOther proposed cuts to federal housing programs could affect all of the estimated 45,000 people in Orange County who currently tap federal dollars to help pay their monthly rent. About half of those people are 60 or older.\n\nAnd an initiative that aims to help lower-income seniors earn money so they rely less on the government – the Senior Community Service Employment Program – would be eliminated entirely. That program, according to the Trump plan, “is effectively an earmark to leftist DEI promoting entities like the National Urban League, the Center for Workforce Inclusion and Easter Seals.”\n\nNone of the proposed changes are set. The White House memo is a wish list, and details of the budget will need to be passed in the GOP-controlled Congress, probably this summer.\n\nBut political experts, nonprofit workers – even an older voter who describes himself as a Trump supporter – all say the White House and its supporters should be wary about that wish list. They say local politicians who support those cuts, and politicians who don’t do much to stave them off, risk walking into a political trap that’s snared others in the past: the ire of voters of a certain age.\n\n“Older people might be ready to get fired up,” said Jimmy Camp, a longtime political consultant in Orange who has worked with candidates across the political spectrum.\n\n“The conditions for it are there, for sure.”\n\nWhile the White House budget would trim everything from school lunches to clean water projects, many of the groups linked to those programs have little influence in GOP politics. Young children can’t vote, and their parents tend to vote for Democrats. Homeless people are infrequent voters. Climate scientists, physicists, entrepreneurs seeking federal health or research grants – all are relatively tiny voting blocs.\n\nBut seniors?\n\n“People my age, we vote,” said John Deal, an 81-year-old retired steel industry executive in Irvine.\n\n“And we don’t forget.”\n\nTribal politics\n\nOlder voters aren’t monolithic.\n\nIn November, nationally, voters ages 50 to 64 were far more likely to back Trump than were voters ages 65 and up, according to a post-election survey by AARP. The middle-age cohort chose Trump (56%) over Kamala Harris (43%), while the 65-and-up crowd split their vote, with 49% going to each candidate.\n\nIt’s unclear if that pattern held in Orange County, where 2024 vote results by age group aren’t yet publicly available.\n\nWhat is clear is that, politically speaking, local older voters tend to punch above their weight. Though people older than 65 account for about 17% of the county’s population, they’ve accounted for closer to 25%, or more, of all votes cast in recent elections.\n\nIt’s part of a long-term pattern. About 41% of county voters age 65 and up are so-called high-propensity voters, meaning they routinely turn out for most elections, according to Political Data Inc., which tracks voting trends in California. By comparison, about 27% of local voters ages 50 to 64 qualify as high propensity, something that’s true of 18% of voters age 35 to 49 and only 13% of voters 18 to 34.\n\nAll that means one thing: Older voters have the ability – and, according to Camp and others, the propensity – to respond to any perceived political slight by punching back.\n\n“(Older voters) are more affected personally by the things that affect their whole group,” Camp said.\n\nDeal, an older voter who identifies as a Trump supporter, agrees. He believes proposed spending cuts that touch lower-income older people could prompt a political response from local seniors of all economic means.\n\n“Look, I voted for Trump. I don’t necessarily love him, personally, but I support his ideas,” said Deal, who noted that he doesn’t tap into federal programs targeted by the White House but does use Social Security and Medicare.\n\nTaxes, Deal said, “should be lower.” And, in his view, federal spending “goes too far” on social programs.\n\n“But I play cards with people who feel differently. And I can see they’re already getting active, going to their (anti-Trump) marches and whatnot.\n\n“I bet these issues about federal programs will be pretty important for all the people running for Congress or even mayor.”\n\nIf federal programs are cut, and if there is a political backlash, it might be sparked more by facts on the ground than by age-oriented identity politics, say people who work with seniors and locals who work on the programs targeted by the White House.\n\n“The (Commodity Supplement Food Program) is used by people 60 or older, who qualify income-wise. It’s for everybody. And it’s in every community, from La Habra to San Clemente, and it largely follows Orange County demographics, with the exception that recipients are slightly more likely to be Asian and Pacific Islander than the county as a whole,” said Mark Lowry, director of Orange County Food Bank, which administers the Commodity Supplemental Food Program in Orange County.\n\n“But all of the people who get those boxes need to get them,” Lowry added.\n\n“It’s income-vetted and, I can tell you, it isn’t a luxury item.”\n\nThe 55-year-old program, initially launched as a way to boost agricultural interests, is now only for people 60 and older whose income is 150% or less of the local poverty rate. In Orange County, the monthly income thresholds to qualify for a food box are $1,957 for one person and $2,644 for a couple. About 109,000 people in California and roughly 707,000 around the country get food each month through the program.\n\nThough the White House wants to end the current food box program – saying it has been “misused for DEI and logrolling,” using terms that refer to diversity programs and political favor-swapping – it also hints at replacing it. The memo pitches the idea of using somebody other than nonprofits to deliver “MAHA food boxes,” referring to the federal “Make America Healthy Again” moniker. The memo adds that the boxes should go directly from farms to needy seniors.\n\nBut the White House memo also claims the switch would result in a $425 million savings for taxpayers. That number doesn’t include any cost that might be needed to come with a new distribution network for a new type of food box.\n\nIn a letter he wrote to other food bank operators who administer the food box program in counties around the country, Lowry suggested the White House proposal – if the administration is sincere about wanting to keep issuing food boxes – might actually result in taxpayers paying more in order to feed needy seniors.\n\n“The Administration claims a $425 million savings by eliminating CSFP,” Lowry wrote. “They provide no cost, however, related to their alternative for MAHA food boxes. The Administration proposes to substitute non-profits who engage volunteers who assemble CSFP food boxes with for-profit companies who will pay employees to package MAHA food boxes. It is reasonable to assume that the Administration is proposing a more costly model that will provide no savings for taxpayers.”\n\nThat pattern holds in other safety net changes suggested by the White House. Though the memo says taxpayers would save $163 billion, overall – even when mixing in spending increases for defense and immigration enforcement – there are no cost estimates for proposed replacements mentioned for at least some of the safety net programs.\n\n“The numbers don’t necessarily make sense,” Lowry said.\n\n“Some of this seems like it might backfire.”\n\nSurviving scrutiny\n\nThe backfire argument – the idea that budget cuts to social programs might actually mean a bigger tax bill rather than a smaller one, and that cuts to social spending would be a drag on the overall economy – is already part of the pushback that’s emerged in the days since the White House posted its budget memo.\n\n“Safety-net programs do much more than just alleviate individual hardships. They are economic engines… ” wrote Orange County Supervisor Doug Chaffee, chair of the Orange County Board of Supervisors, in a May 7 letter to Rep. Young Kim, R-Anaheim Hills, whose CA-40 district includes parts of Riverside, San Bernardino and Orange counties.\n\nIn the letter, Chaffee urged Kim to vote against any cuts to the federal food program SNAP (which was once known as Food Stamps and in California is known as CalFresh), and school-based nutrition programs. He referenced federal research that shows every $1 spent in SNAP benefits generates $1.80 in economic activity, and that every $1 billion spent by taxpayers to boost the SNAP program supports more than 13,000 jobs.\n\nKim also nudged further into the political pushback against White House budget priorities. Last month, she was one of a dozen GOP House members who signed a letter saying they won’t back steep cuts to Medicaid, an issue that could hamstring the push to reduce taxes and lower the budget, or risk taking health care and health insurance away from millions of lower-income Americans.\n\nAnd on May 8, Kim’s office issued a video showing her (gently) grilling Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent over proposed cuts to the Community Development Financial Institution, a program that provides credit and financial services to underserved communities.\n\nPart of their exchange went like this:\n\nRep. Kim: “I’d like to urge you to continue your support for CDFI. CDFI Fund programs are statutory, as you know, and this has been critical in promoting the local economy in Orange County. Do you still agree that the CDFI plan has a critical role to play in fostering economic opportunity?”\n\nSecretary Bessent: “We believe that if CDFI officials follow their statutory obligations and do not digress into more ideological boundaries, they can be important institutions.”\n\nWhat went unmentioned was the fact that the White House wants the program cut.\n\nIn its budget memo, the administration said it would end the CDFI program, in part because it believes that past CDFI grants “may have made race determinant of access to loan programs … and framed American society as inherently oppressive rather than fostering unity.”\n\nBut the biggest financial argument against the cuts might be about federal housing programs, particularly in Orange County and particularly as they relate to older people.\n\nThe White House projects that taxpayers would save around $34 billion if the federal government ended or trimmed a variety of federal housing programs. That’s a huge number. But senior advocates say those cuts almost certainly would mean more homelessness, and that numerous economic studies have shown that homelessness is, among other things, far more expensive than housing assistance.\n\n“The programs that they’re talking about cutting were set up for a reason. And even though there’s a lot of talk about how they’re wasteful or ineffective, when you look closely at what they do, you usually see something different. They work,” said Trinh Phan, director of state income security issues for Justice in Aging, a nonprofit that offers legal help to senior organizations.\n\n“Cutting rent subsidies will result in more people on the streets. It’s simple,” she added.\n\nAlready, the fastest growing demographic in Southern California homeless shelters is people ages 50 and older. And if housing vouchers go away, homeless retirees, as they’re often known, could become common in Orange County.\n\nThat, Phan said, will inspire a political response from older voters.\n\n“We’re already seeing a rise in senior homelessness. And that’s a very public issue; people see the homeless and it affects them,” Phan said. “And, beyond the morality of it, it’s much more expensive to try to help someone who is unhoused than it is to make sure they don’t become unhoused in the first place.\n\n“That could wake a lot of people up.”","summary":"Tens of thousands of lower-income people of a certain age rely on federal help for food and housing, among other things.

Officials in those traditionally four early-voting states are now positioning themselves to get top billing nearly two years before the Democratic National Committee solidifies the order. Others may make a play, too.\n\nIt’s a fraught choice for a party already wrestling with questions about its direction after losing November’s White House election to Republican Donald Trump. Each state offers advantages to different candidates and elevates or diminishes different parts of the Democratic base. \n\nFor now, 2028 prospects are making early-state visits, giving a glimpse into what they may see as their own path to the nomination.\n\nIllinois Gov. JB Pritzker was the keynote speaker at a dinner last month for New Hampshire Democrats, visiting a majority white state known for its engaged electorate and independent streak. Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, the state’s first Black governor, will appear later this month at a similar party event in South Carolina, where Black voters are the party’s most influential voting group.\n\nPete Buttigieg will join a VoteVets Action Fund gathering in Iowa on Tuesday, marking the former presidential candidate’s first public in-person event since leaving his post as Biden’s transportation secretary. Buttigieg performed well in the 2020 caucuses, which were marred by technical glitches that prevented the declaration of a winner. \n\nIowa looks past snub for ‘fair’ shot in 2028\n\nBiden and others pushed to open the 2024 cycle with a more diverse state than traditional leadoff Iowa, which is 90% white, according to census data. \n\nGone was a five-decade institution of Iowa Democrats engaging in a one-night spectacle where community members publicly signaled their support for a candidate. Last year, they held caucuses eight days before any other state’s contest, as is required by Iowa law. But Democratic voters had cast their 2024 presidential preference ballots by mail, with results released that March on Super Tuesday alongside other states.\n\nBiden “picked the calendar that worked for him,” said Scott Brennan, who serves on the DNC’s Rules and Bylaws Committee and previously chaired the Iowa Democratic Party. “When you’re the president, you can do those things. But I don’t know that people in Iowa thought it was very fair.”\n\nFor now, Iowa Democratic leaders emphasize that their focus is on the 2026 election, when two of Iowa’s four congressional districts will be competitive opportunities to unseat Republicans. Democrats have recently struggled on all electoral fronts in Iowa and have significantly diminished party registration numbers, which some blamed on the loss of the caucuses. \n\nBut Brennan said many Iowa Democrats continue to believe that the presidential nominating process is well served by Iowa’s early role in it, even if the 2028 format is up in the air.\n\n“We took everyone at their word that all bets are off for 2028,” Brennan said. “We expect that there will be a fair process and that we will be given every consideration to be an early state.”\n\nFormer U.S. Rep. Dave Nagle was more blunt in proposing that the state party commit to first-in-the-nation status regardless, as he did as chair in 1984 when the national party threatened to upend Iowa and New Hampshire’s delegate selection process over noncompliance with timing rules. The two states formed an alliance, getting six of the presidential candidates on their side.\n\n“All we have to do is look at the Democratic National Committee and say, ‘Sorry, we’re going first,’” Nagle said. “It’s ours if we have the courage.”\n\nNew Hampshire survives threats after rebellion\n\nNew Hampshire rebelled in 2024, holding an unsanctioned primary in January. Biden did not put his name on the ballot or campaign there but won as a write-in.\n\nThree months later, the DNC dropped its threat to not seat the state’s national convention delegates.\n\nUntil Biden’s formal request of the DNC to approve his proposed calendar, New Hampshire Democrats thought they were in a good place with work behind the scenes, said the state party chairman, Ray Buckley. He said that effort will continue heading into 2028.\n\n“This is going to be much more of a level playing field,” Buckley said. “There’s no reason to come in with a two-ton thumb and put it on the scale.”\n\nIt does not hurt their case that New Hampshire law requires the primary to be scheduled before any other similar contest.\n\nKathy Sullivan, formerly a state party chair and member of the DNC’s rulemaking arm, said it is possible that the “train has left the station” for Iowa’s hope of returning to its first-place position, given the 2020 problems and the fact that it gave in to the DNC in 2024.\n\n“I don’t know if that helps them in terms of goodwill or hurts them in that they basically gave up the caucuses,” she said. “New Hampshire took the opposite tack, we had our primary despite what the DNC said, and our delegates ended up being seated despite the threats.”\n\nNever-first Nevada wants top billing\n\nDemocratic leaders in Nevada, which held its 2024 Democratic primary just days after South Carolina’s, have also been pushing to keep their state early in the nominating conversation, although the state’s location in the West has traditionally made it less-visited by White House hopefuls.\n\nIn a December statement, the state party chair, Daniele Monroe-Moreno, pointed to the state’s nonwhite population, union representation and education-level diversity as reasons for Nevada to kick off the 2028 calendar. Nevada is 30% Latino, census data shows, and has significant Black and Asian populations.\n\n“If Democrats want to win back working class voters and rebuild our broad coalition of voters of color, we should elevate the most working class and most diverse battleground state in the nation to be the first presidential preference primary for the 2028 cycle,” Monroe-Moreno said. \n\n“Nevada is the battleground state that best reflects our growing nation,” she said, and the party “cannot afford to let overwhelmingly college-educated, white or less competitive states start the process of winnowing the field again in 2028.”\n\nSouth Carolina seeks another go at No. 1\n\nAs the first-in-the-South primary state, where Black voters play a significant role in Democratic voting, South Carolina long promoted its role in picking a nominee after the first set of contests winnowed the field.\n\nBut Christale Spain, who is expected to win her second term as state party chair, said she will make the argument to national Democratic leaders that South Carolina should stay in the No. 1 slot.\n\n“It’s our plan to really work to stay first in the nation,” Spain said.\n\nAt the end of May, Moore is set to headline the South Carolina Democratic Party’s Blue Palmetto Dinner, a signature fundraiser that has recently hosted Democratic stars as its keynote speakers, including Jennifer Granholm, a former Michigan governor and Biden energy secretary, and Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Raphael Warnock of Georgia. \n\nThen-Vice President Kamala Harris used her 2022 speech as an official “thank you” to South Carolina for providing the key primary support that revived Biden’s flagging 2020 presidential campaign after a series of losses in other early-voting states. \n\nSpain will have to make her argument anew without Biden in the White House and Jaime Harrison, a South Carolina native who recently ended his term as national Democratic chair, helming the party.\n\n“I think you get what you need from an electorate in South Carolina,” Spain said. “All those things matter the stuff that’s happening with the veterans, all our colleges and institutions, the role of Black folks in a Democratic primary.\n\n“We have more to offer than other states do,” she said.\n\nKinnard reported from Chapin, South Carolina, and Ramer from Concord, New Hampshire.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nDES MOINES, Iowa (AP) Before they can name their next presidential nominee,&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Democrats Must Select the First State to Vote Before Choosing Their 2028 Nominee first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/democrats-must-select-the-first-state-to-vote-before-choosing-their-2028-nominee/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/rewrite-this-title-Before-they-name-a-2028-nominee-Democrats.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-11 14:00:22","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.188},{"id":320308958,"title":"‘It must become law’: U.S. Senate candidates in ‘toss-up’ states co-sponsor bill to ELIMINATE women’s sports","text":"Two congressional Democrats seeking to win “toss-up” Senate contests in states won by President Donald Trump are co-sponsoring legislation that would eliminate female-only spaces and infringe on the right of girls and women to compete against only members of their own sex in sports.\n\nDemocratic Georgia Sen. Jon Ossoff and Democratic Michigan Rep. Haley Stevens, who voted against legislation to bar biological males from women’s sports earlier this year, are backing the Equality Act, a bill that would make “gender identity” a protected class under federal anti-discrimination law. The candidates’ decision to support the far-reaching legislation comes as Republicans accuse the two lawmakers of catering to left-wing gender ideology that is at odds with their own voters.\n\nNearly 70% of Democrats or participants who “lean Democrat” oppose biological males participating in women’s sports, according to a New York Times survey conducted between Jan. 2 and Jan. 10.\n\nOssoff, who is viewed as the most vulnerable Democratic incumbent seeking reelection, is currently running unopposed in Georgia’s Democratic primary. Stevens entered a contested Democratic primary field in April to vie for an open Michigan Senate seat following Democratic Michigan Sen. Gary Peters’ decision to not seek reelection.\n\nIn Georgia, 73% of voters told a pollster in January they would support the state government banning transgender athletes from women’s sports. Republican Governor Brian Kemp signed legislation, dubbed the Riley Gaines Act, to protect women’s sports in April.\n\nDespite a majority of voters appearing to reject the Democratic Party’s stance on transgender issues, Ossoff and Stevens appear to be toeing the party line.\n\nOssoff and Stevens are among the 47 Senate Democrats and 214 House Democrats supporting the latest rollout of the Equality Act, which congressional Democrats introduced for the fifth time on April 29. The legislation passed the House in May 2019 and February 2021 under the leadership of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, but did not clear the Senate’s 60-vote legislative filibuster.\n\nThe Equality Act would amend the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to prevent discrimination on the basis of “sexual orientation and gender identity.” The legislation would force schools to open female-only spaces to biological males who identify as transgender girls, including sports teams, according to analysis from the Heritage Foundation.\n\n“As Republicans across the country continue their assault on LGBTQ+ Americans – particularly the trans community – the fight against bigotry and discrimination remains as urgent as ever,” Pelosi said in a April 29 statement marking the Equality Act’s reintroduction.\n\nGeorgia and Michigan are seen as top pick-up opportunities for Senate Republicans during the midterms. Early analysis from the Cook Political Report rates both contests as “toss-ups.”\n\nTrump bested former Vice President Kamala Harris in both swing states in November.\n\nStevens called on Congress to take up the Equality Act again in February two months prior to her Senate campaign announcement.\n\n“As a member of the @EqualityCaucus, I’m celebrating 4 years since we last passed the Equality Act — the 119th Congress needs to bring it to a vote, it must become law,” Stevens wrote in a post on X.\n\nStevens also slammed legislation seeking to bar transgender athletes from women’s sports during a speech on the House floor in April 2023, characterizing the bill as “hateful.”\n\nFormer Republican Michigan Rep. Mike Rogers, who is viewed as the clear frontrunner for the Republican nomination, criticized Stevens for repeatedly failing to protect women’s sports and female-only spaces.\n\n“Michiganders see Haley Stevens’ In-Equality Act for what it is: the radical left’s latest scheme to force boys into girls’ bathrooms and sports teams,” Rogers campaign spokesperson Alyssa Brouillet told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “Meanwhile, Mike Rogers and President Trump are fighting to defend girls’ safety, privacy, and opportunity. Protecting girls’ sports and spaces is not only fair, it’s common sense.”\n\nOssoff, who ran on passing the Equality Act into law during his successful 2020 Senate campaign, has continued to oppose efforts to restrict transgender athletes from participating in girls and women’s sports.\n\nThe senator joined Senate Democrats in filibustering Republican Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville’s Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act in March despite pressure from Georgia Republicans to support the bill.\n\nRepublican Georgia Rep. Buddy Carter, the first Republican candidate to jump into Georgia’s 2026 GOP primary following Kemp’s decision to pass on a run, came out swinging against Ossoff’s left-wing positions on transgender issues in his campaign announcement video.\n\n“Last November Georgia spoke, but Jon Ossoff doesn’t care,” the video’s narrator states. “He fought against President Trump securing our border and voted for men in girls sports. Jon Ossoff is on the wrong side.”\n\nSenate Leadership Fund, a Senate Majority Leader John Thune-aligned super PAC, has also targeted Ossoff for his votes against legislation to protect women’s sports. SLF’s issue advocacy arm, One Nation, ran a seven-figure ad buy to highlight Ossoff’s left-wing stance on women’s sports in April. The ad aired during several high-profile sports events, including the Masters tournament and the Final Four college men and women’s basketball games.\n\n“Man-to-man defense isn’t woke enough for Ossoff. He’s for they/them,” the ad’s narrator says while a man purporting to be Ossoff dunks over a female basketball player.\n\nSpokespeople for Ossoff and Stevens did not respond to the DCNF’s multiple requests for comment.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Donald Trump’s attachment to it is, however, highly selective.\n\nOver the first four months of his administration, Trump has been eagerly promoting the expansion of choice in our economic lives. That’s especially the case when it comes to our role as consumers. Think kitchens, baths and automobiles; the stated goal every time he talks about commodities has been increasing the number of options so we can select and buy what we like best – environmental effects notwithstanding. Even his tariffs are only supposed to bring temporary pain, as in emptier toy shelves, before American-made abundance starts to rule the day once again.\n\nIn our political lives, though, it’s a different story: the president and his administration have been busy instituting new restrictions on both the possibilities on offer and the picking itself. As citizens rather than consumers, we’ve been explicitly told our options are permanently contracting to “save our country”. No longer, for example, should it be possible to share “radical, anti-American ideologies” in our classrooms or decide how we want to be addressed.\n\nAs a result, our economic and political existences are now on rapidly diverging paths – with questions about what choice is good for, where it counts, and who is in charge of the menu at the core. What we are seeing is the emergence of a new kind of authoritarianism that still pays homage to libertarianism, but only in the realm of consumer choice.\n\nA choice explosion\n\nThere is a long backstory here. Ordinary people, wherever they found themselves in the world, once had many fewer choices to make than we typically do today – and they didn’t attach as much meaning to the act of choosing either. One of the things that made one free prior to the modern era was not having to make a lot of decisions about where to live, how to make money, whom to marry, what to own or which political philosophy to back.\n\nBut over the last two and a half centuries, the range of both options and opportunities for choice-making – from determining what to eat for lunch to deciding with whom to spend one’s days and nights – has increased exponentially. The categories of people given the formal power to exercise this kind of self-determination have expanded, too, even as the possibility of being able to use this power has remained wildly unevenly distributed. This isn’t just an American story either. Something similar has happened in countries around the globe that consider themselves capitalist democracies.\n\nThe roots of this choice explosion extend all the way to the 17th and 18th centuries. The expansion of global commerce in the first age of empire is one major source. That’s when advertisements and displays of new products in western European cities made use of increasing variety in goods, such as colored and patterned fabrics from south Asia, to develop the idea of consumer choice. The Reformation is another point of origin insofar as it shattered the unity of European Christendom, eventually putting religious and then intellectual choice on the table as well.\n\nShopkeepers, auctioneers, itinerant preachers and printers helped lead the way, alongside philosophers and novelists. We might think of all of those figures as early versions of what behavioral economists today call “choice architects”: people whose job is to construct the menus of options and, often without calling much attention to themselves, establish the rules for the game of selection. Their power, even when limited, stemmed from creating the conditions for the flourishing of what we have come to experience as the “freedom of choice”.\n\nBut it was the late 19th and 20th centuries that truly sped the process along, turning choice-making into a habitual part of life. Along with more to choose with every passing year came a mass movement towards imagining ones’ life story as constructed out of free choices made in our free time. Democracies were a final piece of the puzzle. Though the era of the American and French Revolutions had already established elections as vital to self-rule, after about 1870, one nation after another began instituting and standardizing technologies like the secret ballot that brought political determinations into line with a range of other individualized, preference-based activities.\n\nToday – at least in theory – we shop for goods, entertainments, courses of study and vacations. We pick our friends, lovers and life partners. We vote for our favorite candidates. We select where we want to live, what we want to do for a profession (though, exceptionally, not what we do when we are actually on the job), whether to have children, and even insurance plans to hedge our bets when facing situations beyond our control. Whole sciences explain how and why we choose what we do and with what consequences. The promise is that, with our own choices, we can get what we personally prefer. And we can be the autonomous people that we yearn to be.\n\nNone of this is to suggest that the proliferation of choice has been an unmitigated boon for humanity, as critics have pointed out repeatedly along the way. Voices on the right of the political spectrum have long bemoaned the way an emphasis on choice upends tradition, especially in the moral sphere – making almost every decision into a form of marketplace transaction in which individual taste rules the day. Many on the left have agreed to an extent, suggesting that modeling life on a shop window or bazaar – in which a product, human or otherwise, exists for every desire – leads to the obfuscation of deep inequalities of opportunity and the neglect of our obligations to each other along with the planet itself. They have also complained (quite rightly) that choice is always a lot less free, in the sense of unconstrained, than we might think.\n\nStill, “choice” has long been a favorite word on both sides of the aisle in US politics (and not least when the issue is contentious, like the future of healthcare). That helps explain why “the right to choose” seemed like a promising slogan in the early 1970s to abortion rights defenders who were eager to find an uncontroversial framing device for their advocacy work in the aftermath of Roe v Wade. Who could object to simply having more choices, especially when the promise was that one could pick in accord with one’s personal values and desires? From billboards to human rights decrees and constitutions, choice has come to stand for freedom itself. It is even a marker now on global happiness indexes; more of one means more of the other. Ever since the end of the second world war, this assumption has made our economic and political lives seem intrinsically linked.\n\nA shrinking political menu\n\nBut that isn’t where we are now. Despite its sporadic and often misleading appeal to the language of choice, the Trump administration is intent on undoing this historical pact between consumer and political choice and thus of a key element of the liberal paradigm. While expanding consumer options, or at least giving the impression this is the plan, this presidency is working hard to limit options in almost all other spheres.\n\nSomething similar is being attempted by many of Trump’s counterparts in other increasingly illiberal capitalist democracies, from Hungary to India, around the globe. (And perhaps this is not just a story about capitalist democracies – even China could now be understood as a nation in thrall to consumer choice at the expense of other forms of freedom.) But this disjunction is becoming especially pronounced in the US, where choice is continuing its ascent in one sphere (albeit within the constraints of an ever-changing policy on tariffs), just as it is being rapidly circumscribed, in both practice and lingo, in most others.\n\nWhen it comes to freedom of choice for consumers, which has long been offered up as the flip side of deregulation for industries, Trump and his minions are all in – at least rhetorically. They borrow cliches that are recognizable from 18th-century sales pitches promising “the greatest choices” in fabrics all the way to Milton and Rose Friedman’s bestselling 1980 book and TV series, Free to Choose. The argument is as much about personal liberty as economic benefit.\n\nRight off the bat, in his inaugural address this January, Trump promised Americans that he was ending the electric vehicle mandate, as well as the rest of Joe Biden’s environmental initiatives, not just to save the auto industry but also so “you’ll be able to buy the car of your choice.” Consecutive executive orders have extended that same logic to appliances, lightbulbs, plumbing and even K-12 education. Undoing regulations that save water and energy and reduce global warming will “safeguard the American people’s freedom to choose from a variety of goods and appliances”. Getting rid of “federal meddling” will also restore “shower freedom”, which depends upon Americans being “free to choose their showerheads”. As for schools, in which the right has long supported a voucher system so that families can select the educational approach they prefer in a marketplace that includes religious and for-profit along with public options, the executive order states: “Pres. Trump will provide every available opportunity for parents to enrich the education of their children through individual choice.”\n\n“Making America Great Again” thus turns out to be largely a promise about an odd kind of consumer paradise. It is not competitive pricing and affordability Trump is after. Nor is it safer or improved goods that would lead to better health and welfare. Rather, just having more options from which to pick is the new holy grail, whether we are talking about dishwashers or elementary schools. Never mind that high tariffs and protectionism will likely make everything more expensive or constrict the field of choice itself at least for a while, forcing parents to buy, in Trump’s words, “two dolls instead of 30”. In fact, under pressure from the business wing of his party, he’s already backed away from the most dramatic of these measures. In the Maga utopia, the deregulation of businesses, especially when it comes to abandoning rules about environmental concerns or racial equity or even corrupt practices, ultimately creates a cornucopia of possibilities for purchasers, who are going to be newly empowered to vote with their wallets for whatever products they like best. Consumer choice is recast as a fundamental right and freedom.\n\nYet apart from the arena of consumption, Trump is little invested in expanding individual, preference-based selection making. On the contrary, in the political sphere, the president seems to be looking to move the US in precisely the opposite direction. Even with falling approval ratings, he is still counting on considerable popular support for a vision of the world in which Amazon offers up thousands of potential possibilities, from movies to toasters, for our pleasure, but nativist chauvinism and a limited repertoire of Christian values curtail options and opportunities for choice in most other domains. He and his fans view it as the function of a strong executive to make both our reality.\n\nWhen it comes to things that don’t take the form of sellable commodities, the parallel framing around freedom as choice has all but disappeared from the vocabulary of this administration. It’s also fast disappearing from policy itself, as representatives of Trump’s brand of Republicanism challenge both the traditional understandings of executive power and constitutional protections around civil and political rights. The latter are precisely those rights outside the consumer sphere – such as religious rights, marriage rights, and rights to determine political representatives – that have been redefined as matters of choice ever since the drafting of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in the aftermath of the second world war. This isn’t how they are being defined by the US government now.\n\nThe ability to make one’s own determinations in ideas, expression and ideology, despite some early Trump administration bromides about the importance of freedom of speech, is on the chopping block as a result of yet another set of executive orders and agency moves. That includes bans, wherever federal dollars or other forms of federal patronage are at stake, on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, the investigation of the climate crisis, the expression of pro-Palestinian sentiments, or the promotion of history, art or literature that runs counter to so-called “patriotic” education, among other topics. Such menu limitations are already being felt from classrooms and laboratories to federal agencies and cultural institutions, even as court challenges are growing in number. Restrictions on people’s choice of residency or travel are also more visible by the day, not least in the actions of Ice. Let’s not forget, either, new limits on options in our sexual and familial lives – such as efforts to further reduce abortion rights at the federal level and refusals to allow people to determine their own identities – especially when it comes to gender.\n\nThen there are efforts to curtail voting itself, which is the primary form of political choice. Kamala Harris tried during her brief presidential campaign last year to tie support for voting rights to abortion rights as similarly threatened “fundamental freedoms”, though the idea never gained much traction. This administration sees things differently.\n\nElections themselves are not likely to disappear entirely any time soon; almost every nation state in the world, no matter how dictatorial, continues to enable some form of voting by citizens. That’s because voting is so closely associated today with the idea that, in any legitimate state, the people’s interests need representation. Trump, moreover, likes to claim a popular mandate for his actions, even as he sometimes flirts with the idea that he is a “king” who is unbeholden to anyone but himself.\n\nStill, the Trump administration is already eagerly suggesting that elections won’t be happening in the same way as they once did, after long insisting that any Trump defeat would be a sure sign of election fraud, thus delegitimizing in advance all but one predetermined result. Indeed, as a slate of proposed new rules designed to actually discourage voting in future federal elections makes clear, much of his administration’s energy in these first months has gone into trying to find new ways to limit who has access to political or intellectual or even cultural choices; to take off the table or reduce rather than increase the set of options available; and to narrow the parameters within which choices can be made and registered. What other purpose could, say, new restrictions on the due dates for mail-in ballots in federal elections serve?\n\nEven the study of choice-making, one of the great developments of 20th-century social science including psychology and economics, is now being reduced by every means possible, from cuts to whole research-funding programs to the blockage of grants for projects making use of certain prohibited words.\n\nChoice architect in chief\n\nWhat Trump is doing is not so much abandoning the idea or practice of choice as making himself our nation’s premier “choice architect”. And he’s doing it – at the expense of both the other branches of government and much of the private sector – as part and parcel of the expansion of executive power. That is, he is using the authority of his position to grant the rest of us sets of approved options, from ideas to identities, but also continually reminding us that it is he, as the nation’s chief executive, who determines who gets to choose and how and when and where. Even threats of high tariffs are meant as leverage – pressure tools in a competitive environment, so that the president can tilt the field the way he likes and remake the set of options on behalf of the US consumer. (Artificial intelligence will surely help.)\n\nThis is a new, 21st-century form of authoritarianism marked by an enduring quasi-libertarian streak when it comes to consumption rather than citizenship. Of course, the freedom of the shopper has never been total freedom. It has always been shaped and bounded by multiple forces, from the interests of business owners and for-profit taste makers to the “nudges” characteristic of anonymous, technocratic policy making, such as using incentives to get people to willingly choose to save more for retirement. But over the last 75 years, much of this choice architecture has become both ubiquitous and invisible, with the promise that personal choice meant personal liberty and that freedom in one sphere would be matched by a similar form of freedom in another.\n\nThe age of choice isn’t fully going away any time in the near future. It is both too entrenched and too profitable. But in a sharp break from much of recent history, our political and economic lives seem to be heading in opposite directions: investment in consumer choice (even if tempered for now by tariffs) is expanding in the Trump era in part as cover for the fact that political choice, along with choice in how to think and live, is on a steep decline.\n\nSophia Rosenfeld is Annenberg professor of history at the University of Pennsylvania and author of The Age of Choice: A History of Freedom in Modern Life (2025).","summary":"From showerheads to plastic straws, the president brags that he’s expanding options for consumers – while drastically restricting choices in almost all other spheres\n\nFreedom of choice is a venerable American value.

Jasmine Crockett revealed that Democrat donors are backing the ‘safest white boy’ possible for their next presidential candidate.\n\nThe congresswoman, known for her strong opposition to Trump, has emerged as one of his most vocal critics during his second term. In response, Donald Trump has labeled Crockett a ‘very low-IQ person.’\n\nRecently, Crockett attempted to ridicule the president’s policies during a House DOGE subcommittee hearing on transgender athletes by creating a game she called ‘Trump or Trans.’\n\nTrump’s comment about Crockett’s intelligence came after she sparked outrage among conservatives by referring to Texas Governor Greg Abbott as ‘Gov. Hot Wheels,’ in reference to his use of a wheelchair.\n\nCrockett later said she was referring to Abbott bussing illegal immigrants out of the country, but the damage was done.\n\nNow, the liberal firebrand has admitted that Democrat donors are eying up ‘the safest white boy’ possible for the 2028 presidential race after losing recent elections with candidates who are women and people of color.\n\n‘It is this fear that the people within the party, within the primary system, will have about voting for a woman because every time we voted for a woman, we’ve lost, so far,’ she said on SiriusXM show Urban Views.\n\n‘And I think that’s a natural fear because we just want to win. So there’s a lot of people that are like, you know what? Like, let’s go find the safest white boy we can find. I mean, I’m just saying.’\n\nWhile she did not say who ‘the safest white boy’ is, the Texas Democrat shared that the donors are backing one specific person.\n\n‘I can tell you that there is one specific candidate. I had a donor on the phones with me telling me that all the donors are lining up behind that candidate. So I can tell, and I tell you, it’s not a black person nor a woman,’ Crockett said.\n\n‘So they have – quote-unquote, “they” – have chosen. When I say “they,” it’s the same donors that most likely had their opinions about Joe Biden and moved… that would be the “they” that I would talk about.’ \n\nCrockett’s 2028 prediction differs from a recent CNN poll that found liberals believe Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is the person who best reflects the party’s key principles – although there wasn’t a clear winner, and many respondents had no opinion at all.\n\nThe survey asked Democrats and Democratic-leaning Independent voters which politician best reflects Democratic Party’s core values today.\n\nTen percent of voters chose AOC, while former Vice President Kamala Harris was a close second with nine percent of the votes.\n\nSanders came in third with eight percent, while House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries was placed fourth with six percent.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama and Texas Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett were tied for fifth with four percent.\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom, former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Michigan Senator Elissa Slotkin and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer were all tied at two percent.\n\nAnother fifteen Democrats, including some lawmakers and governors, each received one percent of the votes, while a whopping 26 percent of respondents had no opinion.\n\nLast week, Trump even suggested that Newsom run in 2028, saying, ‘I’d love him to run for president on the other side.’\n\nHe brought up Newsom in a backhanded way, once again turning his name into an insult by calling him ‘Gavin New-scum’ while seated alongside new Canadian PM Mark Carney at an event where Trump softened his push to make Canada the 51st state by saying it ‘takes two to tango.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nTexas Rep.

Others may make a play, too.\n\nIt's a fraught choice for a party already wrestling with questions about its direction after losing November's White House election to Republican Donald Trump. Each state offers advantages to different candidates and elevates — or diminishes — different parts of the Democratic base. \n\nFor now, 2028 prospects are making early-state visits, giving a glimpse into what they may see as their own path to the nomination.\n\nIllinois Gov. JB Pritzker was the keynote speaker at adinner last month for New Hampshire Democrats, visiting a majority white state known for its engaged electorate and independent streak. Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, the state's first Black governor, will appear later this month at a similar party event in South Carolina, where Black voters are the party's most influential voting group.\n\nPete Buttigieg will join a VoteVets Action Fund gathering in Iowa on Tuesday, marking the former presidential candidate's first public in-person event since leaving his post as Biden's transportation secretary. Buttigieg performed well in the 2020 caucuses, which were marred by technical glitches that prevented the declaration of a winner. \n\nBiden and others pushed to open the 2024 cycle with a more diverse state than traditional leadoff Iowa, which is 90% white, according to census data. \n\nGone was a five-decade institution of Iowa Democrats engaging in a one-night spectacle where community members publicly signaled their support for a candidate. Last year, they held caucuses eight days before any other state's contest, as is required by Iowa law. But Democratic voters had cast their 2024 presidential preference ballots by mail, with results released that March on Super Tuesday alongside other states.\n\nBiden “picked the calendar that worked for him,” said Scott Brennan, who serves on the DNC’s Rules and Bylaws Committee and previously chaired the Iowa Democratic Party. “When you’re the president, you can do those things. But I don’t know that people in Iowa thought it was very fair.”\n\nFor now, Iowa Democratic leaders emphasize that their focus is on the 2026 election, when two of Iowa’s four congressional districts will be competitive opportunities to unseat Republicans. Democrats have recently struggled on all electoral fronts in Iowa and have significantly diminished party registration numbers, which some blamed on the loss of the caucuses. \n\nBut Brennan said many Iowa Democrats continue to believe that the presidential nominating process is well served by Iowa’s early role in it, even if the 2028 format is up in the air.\n\n“We took everyone at their word that all bets are off for 2028,” Brennan said. “We expect that there will be a fair process and that we will be given every consideration to be an early state.”\n\nFormer U.S. Rep. Dave Nagle was more blunt in proposing that the state party commit to first-in-the-nation status regardless, as he did as chair in 1984 when the national party threatened to upend Iowa and New Hampshire's delegate selection process over noncompliance with timing rules. The two states formed an alliance, getting six of the presidential candidates on their side.\n\n\"All we have to do is look at the Democratic National Committee and say, ‘Sorry, we’re going first,’\" Nagle said. “It’s ours if we have the courage.”\n\nNew Hampshire rebelled in 2024, holding an unsanctioned primary in January. Biden did not put his name on the ballot or campaign there but won as a write-in.\n\nThree months later, the DNC dropped its threat to not seat the state’s national convention delegates.\n\nUntil Biden’s formal request of the DNC to approve his proposed calendar, New Hampshire Democrats thought they were in a good place with work behind the scenes, said the state party chairman, Ray Buckley. He said that effort will continue heading into 2028.\n\n“This is going to be much more of a level playing field,” Buckley said. “There’s no reason to come in with a two-ton thumb and put it on the scale.”\n\nIt does not hurt their case that New Hampshire law requires the primary to be scheduled before any other similar contest.\n\nKathy Sullivan, formerly a state party chair and member of the DNC's rulemaking arm, said it is possible that the “train has left the station” for Iowa’s hope of returning to its first-place position, given the 2020 problems and the fact that it gave in to the DNC in 2024.\n\n“I don’t know if that helps them in terms of goodwill or hurts them in that they basically gave up the caucuses,” she said. “New Hampshire took the opposite tack, we had our primary despite what the DNC said, and our delegates ended up being seated despite the threats.”\n\nDemocratic leaders in Nevada, which held its 2024 Democratic primary just days after South Carolina's, have also been pushing to keep their state early in the nominating conversation, although the state’s location in the West has traditionally made it less-visited by White House hopefuls.\n\nIn a December statement, the state party chair, Daniele Monroe-Moreno, pointed to the state’s nonwhite population, union representation and education-level diversity as reasons for Nevada to kick off the 2028 calendar. Nevada is 30% Latino, census data shows, and has significant Black and Asian populations.\n\n“If Democrats want to win back working class voters and rebuild our broad coalition of voters of color, we should elevate the most working class and most diverse battleground state in the nation to be the first presidential preference primary for the 2028 cycle,” Monroe-Moreno said. \n\n“Nevada is the battleground state that best reflects our growing nation,\" she said, and the party \"cannot afford to let overwhelmingly college-educated, white or less competitive states start the process of winnowing the field again in 2028.”\n\nAs the first-in-the-South primary state, where Black voters play a significant role in Democratic voting, South Carolina long promoted its role in picking a nominee after the first set of contests winnowed the field.\n\nBut Christale Spain, who is expected to win her second term as state party chair, said she will make the argument to national Democratic leaders that South Carolina should stay in the No. 1 slot.\n\n“It’s our plan to really work to stay first in the nation,” Spain said.\n\nAt the end of May, Moore is set to headline the South Carolina Democratic Party’s Blue Palmetto Dinner, a signature fundraiser that has recently hosted Democratic stars as its keynote speakers, including Jennifer Granholm, a former Michigan governor and Biden energy secretary, and Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Raphael Warnock of Georgia. \n\nThen-Vice President Kamala Harris used her 2022 speech as an official “thank you” to South Carolina for providing the key primary support that revived Biden's flagging 2020 presidential campaign after a series of losses in other early-voting states. \n\nSpain will have to make her argument anew without Biden in the White House and Jaime Harrison, a South Carolina native who recently ended his term as national Democratic chair, helming the party.\n\n“I think you get what you need from an electorate in South Carolina,\" Spain said. \"All those things matter — the stuff that’s happening with the veterans, all our colleges and institutions, the role of Black folks — in a Democratic primary.\n\n“We have more to offer than other states do,” she said.\n\nKinnard reported from Chapin, South Carolina, and Ramer from Concord, New Hampshire.","summary":"Democrats will pick their next presidential nominee in 2028, but before that happens, the party will have to decide which state gets to go first on the nominating calendar","url":"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/2028-nominee-democrats-decide-state-weigh-121683990","image":"https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/35be26a9-5c4d-454b-ac85-ad6ddc33a6b2/wirestory_f4173356e5d79d32080271cfd5f5b353_16x9.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-11 12:41:21","author":"Hannah Fingerhut Associated Press,Holly Ramer Associated Press,Meg Kinnard Associated Press","authors":["Hannah Fingerhut Associated Press","Holly Ramer Associated Press","Meg Kinnard Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.221},{"id":320152150,"title":"Beyoncé’s Latest Album Soars As Her Tour Kicks Off","text":"Beyoncé’s Cowboy Carter surges on the Billboard 200, Top Country Albums, and Americana/Folk charts ...

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)\nGetty Images\n\nBeyoncé kicked off her Cowboy Carter Tour on April 28 in Inglewood, just outside of Los Angeles, CA. The superstar is scheduled to perform to massive crowds across the United States, with a few stops in Europe, throughout the summer. In each location, she's headlining more than one date — and in cities like New York, London, and Atlanta, she's playing four or more nights as hundreds of thousands turn out for the concert trek\n\nAs excitement around the Cowboy Carter Tour grows, the singer herself, as well as the Cowboy Carter album, are both gaining ground on the Billboard charts.\n\nCowboy Carter Surges on Three Billboard Charts\n\nCowboy Carter is present on three Billboard charts this week, and it is rising on each and every one of them. In some instances, the project moves up just a few spots, while in other cases, it leaps more than 100 spaces.\n\nThe full-length returns to the top 10 on the Top Americana/Folk Albums chart, jumping from No. 15 to No. 8. It also nears that region on the Top Country Albums list, galloping from No. 35 to No. 14.\n\nBeyoncé’s latest studio effort enjoys its greatest gain on the Billboard 200, the all-encompassing ranking of the most-consumed albums in America. On that roster, Cowboy Carter rockets from No. 193 to No. 64.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nMicrosoft Confirms New Free Update Deadline For Windows Users\n\nWWE Backlash 2025 Results, Winners And Grades On May 10\n\nWWE Backlash 2025 Results: John Cena Topples Randy Orton In St. Louis\n\nSales and Streams of Cowboy Carter Grow\n\nLuminate reports that total consumption of Cowboy Carter is up dramatically from the prior frame, which makes sense, thanks to the beginning of the Cowboy Carter Tour. Last week, Beyoncé’s full-length shifted a little more than 8,300 equivalent units. During the most recent tracking stretch, it moved nearly 14,500 units between sales and streaming activity. That’s a 70-plus-percent gain from one frame to the next. Almost 1,000 of those 14,000-plus units were pure sales.\n\nBeyoncé’s Year-Plus on the Billboard Charts\n\nCowboy Carter has now spent 57 weeks on both the Top Country Albums and Top Americana/Folk Albums charts. It hasn’t racked up quite as much time on the Billboard 200, which is a much more competitive ranking. This time around, the title celebrates its forty-fourth turn on that list. It has previously reigned on all three rankings, as Queen Bey almost always conquers a Billboard list when she has a new project to share.\n\nBeyoncé’s Renaissance Also Rises\n\nThe Cowboy Carter tour setlist is, of course, centered largely around the album with which it shares its name. But Beyoncé also incorporates a number of songs from her last album, Renaissance. That project is also growing, although it only appears on one Billboard list. Renaissance steps up from No. 8 to No. 5 on the Top Dance Albums chart this frame.\n\nFollow me on Twitter.\nEditorial StandardsForbes Accolades","summary":"Beyoncé’s Cowboy Carter surges on the Billboard 200, Top Country Albums, and Americana/Folk charts after her tour kicks off.","url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2025/05/11/beyoncs-latest-album-soars-as-her-tour-kicks-off/","image":"https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/67f7d14477ede58317ae01a9/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-11 12:00:00","author":"Hugh McIntyre,Justin Sullivan,Senior Contributor","authors":["Hugh McIntyre","Justin Sullivan","Senior Contributor"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.222},{"id":320374940,"title":"Who Paid for Kamala Harris and Dough Emhoff’s $150K Met Gala Ticket?

What makes her appearance even more special is that this is the first time that she stepped foot at the grand spectacle. \n\nThe couple was seen skipping the red carpet, but she didn’t skip showing up in the photos, though, before the event started, and appeared in a silk silhouette with an asymmetrical cape sleeve and a long scarf.\n\nA spokesperson for Harris said that it was Anna Wintour, the Met Gala co-chair and the Vogue editor-in-chief, who invited her. However, the talk about the tickets wasn’t unveiled regarding who actually paid for it, as the price stands at a whopping amount of $75,000 per person, and is considered as the most exclusive party of the year.\n\nAs usual, users didn’t miss any chance of spreading rumors on X, talking about the mystery of the tickets. \n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n“With a $20 million debt from her campaign, she can afford a $75,000 ticket for the Met Gala,” one user wrote on the platform. “Well, we guess this just proves how budget-minded DemUNIST really are.”\n\n“While regular folks are scraping by, she’s flaunting a dress that probably cost $75,000,” another user said. “Come on, read the room!”\n\n“Who paid for Kamala’s Met Gala $75,000 ticket?” another wrote. “I thought she grew up in a middle-class household. So out of touch.”\n\nSpeculations are also arriving on the fact that the former VP is gradually coming to the limelight again, as she will be mulling a bid as the Governor of California in the upcoming year. Reports also state that on Feb. 15, the couple went backstage for a meeting with the cast and crew of a Broadway musical, A Wonderful World and which circles around the Jazz legend Louis Armstrong.\n\nPeople can check the footage of the musical on the official Instagram page of the show, and it also features Harris shaking hands with them, in different poses, at Studio 54 after the performance.\n\n.@KamalaHarris & @DouglasEmhoff look STUNNING for the #MetGala2025. ❤️‍🔥\n📸: Cameron Smith pic.twitter.com/DEDCK2WTiM\n— best of kamala harris (@archivekamala) May 6, 2025\n\n At the time of the Emerge 20th Anniversary Gala in San Francisco on April 30, she also slammed the ongoing Trump administration, marking her first major speech since she lost the Presidential election to Donald Trump.","summary":"A glamorous night with an unanswered question—who footed the bill for Kamala’s couture debut?","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/who-paid-for-kamala-harris-and-dough-emhoffs-150k-met-gala-ticket-the-internet-wants-answers","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Kamala-Harris-and-Doug-Emhoff.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-11 11:42:39","author":"Mayukh B","authors":["Mayukh B"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.253},{"id":320121636,"title":"Media can blur faces, but not the effects of illegal immigration","text":"That’s why Texas’s efforts to bus illegal immigrants to the blue “sanctuary” cities in recent years were so successful. For New York, Denver, and the District of Columbia, the immigration issue was no longer about faceless abstractions in far-off flyover country. Suddenly, the problems that come with mass migration were both very clear and very present to them.\n\nIt worked — illegal immigration leapt to the top of voters’ concerns in the 2024 presidential election. And throughout the chaos of that time, with the Pelosi coup and then-Vice President Kamala Harris’s repeated reinventions, former and future President Donald Trump never wavered. He pledged to remove the criminal illegal immigrants who are terrorizing U.S. communities.\n\nNow he’s keeping his promises — and keeping the focus on the real criminal illegal immigrants and their real victims.\n\nThe Trump administration is right to adopt this strategy as its own. The more the public knows about the criminals being deported, the more they support the deportations.\n\nStill, CBS was outraged.\n\n“The booking photos, which the White House says show noncitizens in the country illegally, are displayed in a way that they will show up in television appearances by White House journalists and administration officials from the North Lawn,” the outlet reported. “CBS News has not been able to independently verify the White House statements about the individuals in the photos.”\n\nIn fact, the White House made sure that enough information was available on each of the cases it highlighted with those signs to confirm the details.\n\nMSNBC had a full-on meltdown.\n\n“They put them up on the driveway of the White House,” one anchor said. “… It’s right directly behind the positions where TV correspondents do their hits from the White House lawn. So no matter what network you’re on, that includes MSNBC, those pictures will be behind you.”\n\nWe need this same reminder with sheriffs and local law enforcement across Texas.\n\nThree months ago, the Florida Sheriffs Association announced that every county jail throughout the state had signed a written agreement with ICE to ensure compliance with 287(g) program requirements. The 287(g) program, also known as the Immigrant Enforcement Program, allows local law enforcement to partner with ICE to enforce federal immigration laws. In Florida, every county is working with ICE to ensure there are ICE-deputized sheriffs’ deputies and correctional officers in all county jails.\n\nIn Texas, not so much. A month after Florida had statewide participation, the legislative chairman of the Sheriffs’ Association of Texas gave excuses as to why Texas sheriffs had not done the same, claiming budget constraints and other reasons for not voluntarily participating. Apparently, many Texas law enforcement officers are only willing to do their jobs when tied to more state funding.\n\nThis has caused the Texas legislature to propose legislation intended to force sheriffs to participate in the ICE 287(g) program, which law enforcement already has the authority to do voluntarily.\n\nMaybe instead, we should post signs depicting dangerous serial offenders, repeatedly released back into the community, next to sheriffs’ offices and on the local courthouse lawn. We can name and shame the judges and sheriffs in the nation who refuse to cooperate with ICE to keep our country safe.\n\nNOT ALL IMMIGRATION IS EQUAL\n\nICE cannot do this job alone — it needs the cooperation of local and state law enforcement, including, and especially, in Texas.\n\nThose signs on the White House lawn forced the media to confront the reality of illegal immigration. Texas Senate Bill 8 could force recalcitrant law enforcement agencies to do the same. And we’ll all be safer for it.\n\nRobert Henneke is the executive director and general counsel at the Texas Public Policy Foundation.","summary":"Producers at CBS, CNN and MSNBC took the time to blur the faces of child rapists, murderers, and other violent criminals whose details were posted on signs lining the lawn at the White House last week.

I want to see her boobs.” The AI chatbot then appeared to respond to the request, generating an edit depicting the woman in a bra, and shared the edited image within the same thread.\n\nBy sharing the edited image within the thread, the Grok ethics loophole didn’t just allow nefarious users to see the images, but appeared to show them publicly to anyone digging through the responses to a post.\n\nX’s AI tool is known for its more lax restrictions, initially designed to give the bot a sense of humor. And the “undress” prompts are not the first time the chatbot has come under fire.\n\nPreviously, for example, the AI was criticized for responding to requests to create depictions of politicians wearing bikinis. While many AI platforms refuse to generate images of recognizable people or copyrighted characters, Grok has fewer restrictions in place.\n\nFollowing the report of the bot responding to requests to undress, however, it appears that Grok has at least one more guardrail in place. On images posted after May 07, the AI now responds to similar requests with “I can’t help with that.”\n\nWhile X appears to have added “undress” prompts to Grok’s list of restrictions, the loophole highlights one of the dangers with generative AI: users will probably find ways around restrictions to use AI in unethical ways.\n\nEarlier versions of Grok, for example, reportedly generated images of former US Vice President Kamala Harris wearing a bikini, an ethics loophole that Grok had reportedly fixed.\n\nBut if the AI already added a loophole not to show presidential candidates and celebrities in bikinis, why didn’t those same restrictions apply to editing an image of any recognizable person?\n\nOutside of the AI responding to inappropriate requests to create nonconsensual sexual imagery, the incidents also highlight a potential pitfall for Grok’s recent ability to respond in threads to questions tagged with @grok.\n\nThe social platform started rolling out the ability to ask Grok questions in comments in March. The AI doesn’t always respond (and won’t with certain privacy settings). But, when it does, the AI posts publicly viewable posts in the threads.\n\nNefarious users will probably always find a way around AI restrictions, but giving an AI autonomy to respond to posts publicly opens up the possibility that those unethical images will reach beyond just the user who typed in the prompt.\n\nThe feature is perhaps a funny tool when asking an AI if the moon is really made out of cheese, but in the case of the “undress” fiasco, it also allowed the ethically lax AI to publicly post an edited image it shouldn’t have generated in the first place.\n\nYou may also like…\n\nRead up on how to spot an AI-generated image.","summary":"X's AI bot didn't just respond to a request it shouldn't have –it shared the resulting image","url":"https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/tech/social-media/remove-her-clothes-groks-latest-ai-fiasco-illustrates-one-of-the-key-dangers-of-an-autonomous-ai","image":"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Feu6teFXPkiRwMTSpSmX6i.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-11 09:15:00","author":"Hillary K.

Charlie Baker who is running for governor as a Republican, has faced backlash for telling a local Republican town committee earlier this year that he did not vote for Trump or Kamala Harris in 2024.\n\nBut on the flip side, he was quickly labeled “MAGA Mike Kennealy” by the Massachusetts Democratic Party as part of a strategy to tie any Republican running for office in 2026 to the president in the hopes that left-leaning independent voters will walk away from them.\n\nInside the Massachusetts Republican Party, voters are arguing about just how close they want their candidate to be to Trump. Some say that Republicans running for office must at least acknowledge what they consider to be accomplishments by the Trump administration this year.\n\nOthers counter that sidestepping Trump — or ignoring him completely — is the only way to draw in unenrolled voters who are no fans of Trump but are also not happy with Democrats’ iron-clad grip on the Legislature, Congressional seats, and constitutional offices in Massachusetts.\n\nJohn Deaton, who ran last year as a Republican against U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, said there are many moderate Democrats who feel disenfranchised in Massachusetts because the party is “too far left.”\n\nRepublicans, he said, should be working to convince them to vote for their candidates.\n\nDeaton faced pushback during his campaign last year for holding some stances that the right wing of the Republican Party disliked. He also admitted during the course of his run against Warren that he has “never been a Trump voter.”\n\nBut he still considers himself a “center-right person.”\n\n“We live in Massachusetts, and are you really going to take the position that because you think I’m not conservative enough, that there’s no difference between me and Ed Markey or me and Elizabeth Warren? That is a foolish, quite frankly idiotic position to take,” Deaton told the Herald in an interview this past week.\n\nDeaton earned 40% of the 3.5 million votes cast in his race against Warren, or 114,137 more than Trump earned in his matchup against former Vice President Kamala Harris, according to certified election data from Secretary of State William Galvin’s office.\n\nRepublicans who want candidates to acknowledge or further embrace Trump’s ideology often point to the gains that he made in Massachusetts last year compared to his election in 2020.\n\nHe won 87 cities and towns in the state last year, including 33 that had gone for President Joe Biden in 2020.\n\nBut conservative candidates in Massachusetts, especially those running for governor or other statewide offices, are expected to face a difficult road.\n\nThe Trump factor poses only one hurdle — political hopefuls are also dealing with fundraising and name recognition challenges, according to experts who previously spoke to the Herald.\n\nWendy Wakeman, a veteran Republican political strategist, said she agrees that the “never Trumpers” and the “MAGA MAGAs” of the Massachusetts Republican Party need to unify.\n\nShe also said a candidate does not necessarily need to swear loyalty to Trump, but they must be able to talk about him without fear.\n\n“They tend to pull us apart, and that’s not good,” she said of the two wings of the MassGOP. “… I’m not saying that you have to be a Trump loyalist in order to carry the banner for our party in 2026, but you must be able to acknowledge that the national Republican leader of the party is doing a heck of a job.”\n\nDeaton, who is weighing another challenge to U.S. Sen. Ed Markey in 2026, said a Republican candidate should not run against Trump but should run on the same principles as the president.\n\n“Here in Massachusetts, you have to thread the needle,” he said.","summary":"To MAGA or not to MAGA?
