That began with a very unexpected return to social media giant X on Monday morning and will culminate with an interview with Elon Musk. The former president, having seen the presidential race reset due to Democratic Party elites shoving Joe Biden aside and coronating Kamala Harris, is hoping to retake the initiative. Part of that is going around the insanely biased national press that has been hyperventilating over Harris since she became the presumptive nominee. Sure, she’s one of the worst politicians in history, with a long record of failure, but have you considered she’s “brat” and once worked at McDonald’s? That’s been about the extent of the press coverage she’s received as an army of “journalists” have sought to “reintroduce” her to the public for the umpteenth time by profusely singing her praises. They’ve taken a decidedly different tact with Trump, though. On CNN, Axios reporter Sara Fischer complained that the former president might (gasp!) “say whatever he wants.” Axios’ @sarafischer: “@elonmusk will let Donald Trump speak all of the falsehoods & misinformation that he wants. I mean, he’s not a journalist … Does he want to be fact checking all the information? So I think it‘s just a platform for Trump to come out say whatever he wants.” pic.twitter.com/13w1MVzzGD— Tom Elliott (@tomselliott) August 12, 2024 FISCHER: Well, for one, I think it’s going to be a very light-hearted conversation. Because Elon Musk has come out and endorsed Donald Trump, I expect this a bromance type of an interview where they’re supporting each other. I think Elon Musk will let Donald Trump speak all the falsehoods and misinformation that he wants. I mean, he’s not a journalist, it’s not his job nor necessarily does he want to be fact-checking all the information. I think it’s just a platform for Donald Trump to say whatever he wants. But the thing to remember, Kasie, is that like, the interview audience here is what Donald Trump needs. You see JD Vance going on Face the Nation, Sunday Shows, traditional media because he needs to get his name out there. Donald Trump’s going the opposite route, he’s talking to streamers and podcasters. He’s going on X. He wants to rally up that sort of fringe online base. That’s what Donald Trump is doing here tonight. Woah, woah, woah. Donald Trump may “say whatever he wants?” What does he think this is? The United States of America? That entire exchange is just mind-numbing. Here we have supposed journalists fretting that someone might dare to exercise their right to free speech without the press overlords being consulted. I mean, Musk might not live “fact-check” Trump with incredibly obtuse and unfair characterizations. Oh, my heavens! Meanwhile, Kamala Harris has done zero interviews since successfully committing a coup against the sitting president and becoming the Democrat nominee without winning a single vote. Is CNN mad about the disrespect she’s showing them? Are they as worried about her taking no questions as they are about Trump taking questions from someone who doesn’t hate his guts? Of course, they aren’t. The self-righteousness of the press is nauseating. They truly believe they should be able to control the flow of information. Luckily, that’s not how it works anymore. Candidates for office can and will go around them to speak directly to the people. That’s far more interesting than seeing Dana Bash or Kasie Hunt gnash their teeth at statements they find politically inconvenient. Mainstream press interviews have their place, but they are no longer the pinnacle and are certainly no longer the only option.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nDonald Trump is in the midst of a strategy shift as the&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: CNN Extremely Upset About Donald Trump&#8217;s Conversation With Elon Musk first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/cnn-extremely-upset-about-donald-trumps-conversation-with-elon-musk/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rewrite-this-title-CNN-Gets-Supremely-Triggered-Over-Donald-Trump039s.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-13 00:34:19","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.339},{"id":253976726,"title":"Live: Glitches Hit Start Of Elon Musk's Interview With Donald Trump","text":"Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk is interviewing Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on the X social media network today. The interview could provide Trump an opportunity to seize the limelight at a time his Democratic rival for the US presidential election, Vice President Kamala Harris, has erased his lead in opinion polls and energised Democratic voters with a series of high-energy rallies. The Trump campaign has called it the \"interview of the century\". \"This is unscripted with no limits on subject matter, so should be highly entertaining!\" 53-year-old Musk, who has an estimated net worth of $235 billion, posted in a preview of the interview on Sunday.

Reporters, photographers and video journalists representing The Associated Press and other news organizations who either traveled with Vice President Harris or were on the airport tarmac documented the crowd size last Wednesday as she arrived on Air Force Two. Harris' campaign also denied the photo in question was manipulated and posted about it on social media. Fifteen thousand people attended the Detroit airport rally, Harris' campaign said. Harris and Walz spoke from inside a hangar where people were packed in. The crowd also spilled out onto the tarmac. The Wayne County Airport Authority, which oversees the airport, referred questions about the size of the crowd to Harris' campaign. Thousands of people have been showing up at her campaign rallies. By the Harris campaign’s count, 12,000 people turned out for rallies in Philadelphia and Eau Claire, Wisconsin, last week, followed by 15,000 in Glendale, Arizona. In Las Vegas on Saturday, more than 12,000 people were inside a university arena when law enforcement halted admission because people were getting ill waiting outside in the extreme 109-degree heat. About 4,000 people were waiting in line when the doors were closed. An Associated Press reporter who covered the Harris events in Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona and Nevada, witnessed the throngs of people in attendance. Trump pushed his false claims in back-to-back posts on his social media site on Sunday. “Has anyone noticed that Kamala CHEATED at the airport? There was nobody at the plane, and she ‘A.I.’d’ it, and showed a massive 'crowd' of so-called followers, BUT THEY DIDN’T EXIST!.” he wrote. He included a post from another individual who made similar allegations about photo manipulation. A minute later Trump posted, “Look, we caught her with a fake ‘crowd.’ There was nobody there!\" He included a photo of the crowd that was partly shaded and partly exposed to the sun. Harris' campaign confirmed on Monday that the photo being questioned was taken by a staff member and was not in any way modified using AI. Hany Farid, a University of California, Berkeley, professor who focuses on digital forensics and misinformation, analyzed the photo using two models trained to detect patterns of generative AI and found no evidence of manipulation. The models were developed by GetReal Labs, a company Farid co-founded. Farid, responding Monday in an email, said he compared several versions of the photo and the only alteration he detected was some simple change to brightness or contrast, and perhaps sharpening. He said many other images and videos from the event last Wednesday show the same basic scene. Trump started pushing false theories about the Harris campaign photo a few days after he held a news conference at his Florida estate on Thursday and was asked about the crowds at his Democratic rival's rallies. Trump said no one draws crowds as big as he does. “I’ve spoken to the biggest crowds. Nobody’s spoken to crowds bigger than me,\" Trump claimed at the news conference, his first since Harris became the Democratic presidential nominee. He went on to falsely compare the crowd at his speech in front of the White House on Jan. 6, 2021, to the crowd at Martin Luther King Jr.’s famous “I Have a Dream” speech on Aug. 28, 1963, at the Lincoln Memorial. But King drew far more people. Approximately 250,000 people attended the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, at which King gave his speech, according to the National Park Service. The Associated Press reported in 2021 that there were at least 10,000 people at Trump’s address. Some of Trump’s top advisers and supporters have been urging the former president to focus his criticisms on Harris’ policies and talk more about the border and the economy. “Stop questioning the size of her crowds,” was the advice former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., offered during a Fox News appearance on Monday. The Harris campaign needled Trump on a variety of issues in an email Monday titled “9 Days Since Trump's Last Swing State Event.” The note included a bullet point that said, “he's very mad about crowd sizes, claiming it's all fake and AI-generated. (Maybe if he campaigned he'd get crowds too?)” © Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Fox News Digital has reached doubt to the Harris campaign asking if her position has changed. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, posted the footage on his social media feed. \"When she tells you who she is… …believe her,\" he wrote. As of the July 2024 fiscal year, more than 37,000 migrants were being held across 18 private detention facilities, according to U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement (ICE) data. Just over 10,000 of those migrants have criminal records while about 4,600 have pending criminal charges. On Monday, ICE announced several arrests, including the deportation of a Brazilian man wanted for attempted murder who was caught and released at the southern border in March. A Dominican man was also arrested and charged with fentanyl trafficking in Massachusetts after he was caught & released at the border in February. A Guatemalan migrant was arrested and charged with child molestation in Rhode Island. He was caught and released at the border during the Obama administration. Also arrested was an Ecuadorian \"gotaway\" charged with rape and kidnapping in Massachusetts. TRUMP EYES MULTIPLE BORDER VISITS AS HE DRAWS CONTRAST WITH ‘RADICAL LEFT’ HARRIS As vice President, Harris was tapped by President Biden to serve as a border \"czar\" to address illegal immigration from Central America. Since announcing her presidential campaign, Republicans have criticized Harris over the Biden administration's record on the border, which has seen record numbers of illegal immigrants released into the United States. In 2018, Harris compared Homeland Security agencies to the Ku Klux Klan (KKK). The Sen. Harris was questioning Ronald Vitiello, who was former President Trump’s nominee to lead ICE, if he was \"aware of the perception\" of parallels between ICE and the KKK.

When combined, the pieces seemingly represent Murdoch’s frustration with how the Trump campaign has floundered recent weeks, from its pick of Sen. JD Vance as his running mate against his wishes to Trump’s continued belligerent complaints to his inability to land on a clear message to combat against her ascendant campaign. As Trump has spent weeks defining Harris’ presidential candidacy through racist attacks and baseless crowd conspiracies, it has been left to the two newspapers to vocalize what Murdoch and his editors see as the policy and personality contrasts between the two that the billionaire media mogul would dearly love Trump to major on beyond his relentless, vicious, mad-sounding attacks. If Fox News has, for now at least, stayed fully signed up to the Trump train, the two leading Murdoch newspaper titles in the U.S. are sounding their own passenger alarms. “Trump Meets Half the Moment in His RNC Speech,” read the headline on a Journal editorial board piece hours after the speech. Since then, The Journal’s editorial board has published almost daily pieces on various policy positions of Harris’, almost crafting talking point memos for the GOP to seize on. One on Sunday attacked her reversal on single-payer healthcare, while a Thursday editorial questioned her bona fides as a potential commander-in-chief. Others have also targeted her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. “Donald Trump often shoots from the hip on these subjects, and his favorable comments about dictators are witless,” read Thursday’s Harris piece. “But his first-term record, especially on Iran and the Middle East, is far stronger than the Biden-Harris performance. Americans shouldn’t have to read tea leaves to figure out if Ms. Harris would keep the country safe in a treacherous world.” (The Daily Beast has reached out to the Journal and New York Post for comment.) Its continued commentary on the election reflects how Murdoch has operated his papers and exercised his political muscle in the past, both in the U.S. and abroad. Murdoch is infamous for calling his editors almost daily, and when he vehemently opposed Trump’s pick of Vance last month, he reportedly dispatched Post columnists and executives to meet with Trump and urge him to consider someone else. But Trump stood firm, and Vance got the job. Murdoch’s U.K. tabloid The Sun was also notorious for making or breaking British elections, gleefully admitting in a front-page headline it aided in the 1992 election of the Conservative Party. (Murdoch later claimed he found the headline “tasteless.”) It’s also credited with the election of Labour leader Tony Blair in 1997 after a 20-year streak of supporting the Tories, endorsing him through his 2005 election before reverting to its conservative roots. The paper eventually, and surprisingly, returned to the Labour Party and endorsed Keir Starmer in last month’s election, which he won. The conservative-leaning Journal editorial board has never appeared eager to anoint Trump, with its November 2022 editorial titled “Trump Is the Republican Party’s Biggest Loser,” following Republicans’ razor-thin midterm wins that cycle, serving as a prime example of its frustration toward his temperament. Yet the paper has still oscillated between defending (and advising) Trump and attacking President Joe Biden. It’s a reflection of Murdoch’s own views on the former president, a man he regarded in emails revealed by the Fox-Dominion case as going “increasingly mad” over his 2020 election loss and who Murdoch predicted would become “irrelevant” following the 2020 election. The Fox-Dominion case only ever arose because Murdoch’s TV mouthpiece, Fox News, regurgitated the former president’s claims of a stolen election, costing the network $787 million. Author Michael Wolff reported in his book last year, The Fall: The End of Fox News and the Murdoch Dynasty, that Murdoch even and often wished Trump were dead. “Trump’s death became a Murdoch theme: ‘We would all be better off …?’ ‘This would all be solved if …’ ‘How could he still be alive, how could he?’ ‘Have you seen him? Have you seen what he looks like? What he eats?’” according to the book. Still, the two appeared to have mended their post-election hostilities. Trump told podcast hosts Clay Travis and Buck Sexton that he and Murdoch speak “a lot,” and Murdoch made a rare appearance at the Republican National Convention last month. “He’s 100 percent sharp—he’s as sharp as a tack,” Trump told the hosts. Murdoch likely hopes Trump means those words, if the advice his Journal editorial board has offered Trump and Republicans is any indication: “The former President will have to make a case on policy, rather than personal insults, and that isn’t his strength,” read a July 24 editorial. “The economic and security fundamentals still favor Mr. Trump, but this is now a competitive race.” Whether Trump heeds it, however, is another matter. On Saturday, new New York Times polls showed Harris leading Trump in multiple swing states. On Saturday, Trump called Harris a “RADICAL LEFT LUNATIC.” If Trump carries on like this, who knows—Murdoch may feel, as the campaign enters its dying days, to do what he did in Britain, and turn his back on the leading right-wing candidate and support Harris. That stated support written in either or both outlets—one totemic for the business community, the other for New York—would not only represent an emphatic rejection of Trump by two communities whose approval Trump so desires, it would be from a mogul whose audiences he has courted so ferociously and effectively. Perhaps Trump—in his pick of Vance, despite Murdoch’s antipathy—has made his own calculations about what he does and does not need from Murdoch. Certainly Murdoch’s influence in British politics, while still undoubtedly strong, has waned in recent years as people source their media from less-traditional sources. Regardless, this presidential election is not just the battle of Harris and Trump, but a reckoning for two powerful men who find themselves yoked together—the best of frenemies.","summary":"Photo Illustration by Thomas Levinson/The Daily Beast/GettyRupert Murdoch is not happy with Donald Trump.

According to AdImpact, NRSC canceled its full cable reservation in one of the most competitive races in the country in which ads were set to run between Aug. 31 and Election Day. The ads were to benefit GOP candidate Bernie Moreno and hurt incumbent Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH). The campaign committee had already been relying on support from allied super PACs that will continue to pour money into the race. The Senate Leadership Fund, the committee’s largest allied super PAC and its affiliated subsidiaries have rolled out millions in ad buys in battleground states across the country. “These dollars can be spent more efficiently via hybrid advertisements, which get the candidate rate. NRSC is relying on SLF and other outside groups to carry the super PAC message in Ohio and Montana,” said a source familiar with the NRSC strategy. The Senate campaign arm emphasized Ohio is still a top pickup opportunity. “Kamala Harris and Joe Biden’s historical unpopularity in Ohio means advertising dollars can be spent more efficiently as hybrid ads,” they wrote in a post on X. “Ohio remains a top pickup opportunity for Senate Republicans and NRSC will continue to invest accordingly.” NRSC had already taken a similar approach in Montana, where outside PACs had already booked airtime. In Pennsylvania, the Keystone Renewal PAC had booked millions of ads for GOP candidate Dave McCormick and another super PAC is prepared to spend on behalf of Republican Larry Hogan in Maryland. The Ohio race has become 2024’s first non-presidential race to exceed $300 million in spending, and it’s also one of the most expensive races that the political ad tracking firm has seen. Before NRSC pulled their advertising spending, Ohio was the only state in which Republicans had been outspending Democrats on campaign ads, where they were slated to spend $158.4 million compared to $152 million from Democrats. However, now Democrats have spent more in future advertising slated in the state, with $86.2 million in future ads compared to Republicans’ $83.3 million.

The statement followed EU Commissioner Thierry Breton’s open letter to Musk, 53, reminding the X CEO that his social media platform is subject to the EU’s Digital Services Act – a sweeping provision that took effect last August and requires the largest tech companies to moderate content, protect user privacy and address risks to the public. Musk is hosting a live “conversation” with Trump, 78, on X Spaces Monday night. “With great audience comes greater responsibility,” Breton wrote on X, arguing that “there is a risk of amplification of potentially harmful content in [the EU] in connection with events with major audience around the world.” Breton’s letter suggested that Musk’s livestream with Trump “might increase the risk profile of X and generate detrimental effects on civic discourse and public security.” “My services and I will be extremely vigilant to any evidence that points to breaches of the DSA and will not hesitate to make full use of our toolbox, including by adopting interim measures, should it be warranted to protect EU citizens from serious harm,” the EU official warned. X CEO Linda Yaccarino slammed the letter, calling it an “unprecedented attempt to stretch a law intended to apply in Europe to political activities in the US.” “It also patronizes European citizens, suggesting they are incapable of listening to a conversation and drawing their own conclusions,” she added. Meanwhile, Musk replied to Breton’s post with a meme based on the 2008 film “Tropic Thunder” with the text, “TAKE A BIG STEP BACK AND LITERALLY, F–K YOUR OWN FACE!” “To be honest, I really wanted to respond with this Tropic Thunder meme, but I would NEVER do something so rude & irresponsible!” he wrote alongside the meme. The Trump campaign further suggested that the EU never would’ve sent the letter if Trump were in the White House. “Only in Joe Biden and Kamala Harris’ America can an un-Democratic foreign organization feel emboldened enough to tell this country what to do,” Cheung said. “They know that a President Trump victory means America will no longer be ripped off because he will smartly utilize tariffs and renegotiated trade deals that puts America First.”","summary":"\"The European Union should mind their own business instead of trying to meddle in the U.S. Presidential election,” Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said in a statement. ","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/12/us-news/trump-campaign-accuses-eu-of-attempting-to-meddle-in-the-us-presidential-election/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/2165963330.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-12 23:29:43","author":"Victor Nava","authors":["Victor Nava"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.265},{"id":253975226,"title":"Top Republicans Urge Trump to Cease Campaign Strategy as Kamala Gains Momentum: ‘Causing Frustration’","text":"Several top Republicans sounded the alarm on Donald Trump’s campaign strategy – including one who said his ‘head is exploding’ – as Kamala Harris continues to take momentum. Former Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy said that Trump has to focus on Harris’ record rather than the number of people attending her rallies. McCarthy told Fox News: ‘It’s going to be a race, and you’ve got to make this race not on personalities. Stop questioning the size of her crowds and start questioning her position when it comes to what did she do as attorney general on crime!’ He called Harris ‘a perfect person to run against’ and ‘made a wrong pick when it came to VP’ and as long as Trump can focus on that, he will be back in the race. The ex-California Congressman wasn’t alone, however, as Trump’s former advisor Peter Navarro had a similar critique of the race the former president has run since Joe Biden dropped out. ‘He needs votes, and the current rally formula is simply not sufficiently focused on the very stark policy differences — policy differences — between him and Kamala Harris that will swing voters in key battleground states, he told Steve Bannon’s War Room podcast. Navarro, who spent time in prison for his role in the January 6 insurrection, said that instead, Trump attacks Harris ‘personally’ and says her ‘support among swing voters rises, particularly among women’ when he does. ‘It’s just a fact of life, right now’. Frank Luntz, dubbed ‘the Nostradamus of pollsters’, continued a media tour that has had him pulling the fire alarm over Trump’s campaign this past week. Luntz – who has said that Harris is now favored to win – repeated his message from over the weekend that Trump has lost message discipline. He claimed that the campaign needs to be about issues and not attributes. ‘If it’s about attributes, Harris is much more likely to be successful because, quite frankly, people like her more than they like him. It’s something that if he’s watching this right now, his head is exploding and that’s part of the problem,’ he told CNN. Luntz added: ‘He has lost touch with the people that he needs and she is in perfect touch’. Trump was the red-hot favorite last month when he triumphantly appeared at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee after being shot in an assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania. But after Harris took over from Biden, the liberal media has gone full-swing behind her campaign and she has seized momentum. The latest polling average from Real Clear Politics shows that Harris has a half-point lead over Trump. In the betting averages that lead is higher at 5.8 percentage points. In one recent example, Harris was more trusted on the economy than Trump – marking a big shift in voter sentiment following Biden’s decision to drop out. The survey, for the Financial Times and the Ross School of Business, found that Harris had a 1-point advantage. It is the first time a Democrat presidential candidate has led Trump on the economy since the poll started tracking voter sentiment on the issue almost a year ago. Another poll by New York Times / Siena College last week found that Harris has moved ahead in the key battleground states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Among likely voters in each state, 50 percent said they would likely vote for Harris while 46 for Trump. Donors are worried about Trump’s recent strategy, according to The New York Times. At an August 2 dinner in The Hamptons, Trump’s big backers hoped he would ‘signal that he was recalibrating after a series of damaging mistakes.’ But he discussed his ‘stop the steal’ claims about the election being rigged in 2020 which advisers have reportedly told him to drop. The former president last night risked sparking further concern by falsely claiming that his Democratic opponent had doctored an image of the crowd at her rally last week in Detroit. Republican sources told Axios over the weekend that the former president is ‘struggling to get past his anger.’ The Trump campaign has considered many options to boost the president’s efforts, including the return of iconic campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, with the backing of both Melania and Lara Trump. The 2024 Trump campaign has suffered from a triple blow of vice presidential nominee JD Vance’s poor reception from the public, Harris’ ‘honeymoon period’ as she jumps into the race and a similar effect on her choice of running mate Tim Walz. Now, what had appeared to be a coronation of Trump for a return to the White House over Biden has turned into a neck-and-neck race, with Harris beginning to take a lead in the polls. However, the ‘honeymoon phase’ of both Harris’ campaign and Walz’s announcement appears to be ending with claims of ‘stolen valor’ over the Minnesota governor’s military service. Biden himself finally admitted Sunday that he dropped out of the race because the polling between himself and Trump was so dire that it threatened to wipe out Democrats up and down the ticket.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nSeveral top Republicans sounded the alarm on Donald Trump&#8217;s campaign strategy &#8211;&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Top Republicans Urge Trump to Cease Campaign Strategy as Kamala Gains Momentum: &#8216;Causing Frustration&#8217; first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/top-republicans-urge-trump-to-cease-campaign-strategy-as-kamala-gains-momentum-causing-frustration/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/08/12/23/88458297-13736981-Former_Speaker_of_the_House_Kevin_McCarthy_said_that_Trump_has_t-m-7_1723502597278.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-12 23:29:03","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.371},{"id":253975302,"title":"Harris Is Now the Betting Favorite To Win 2024 Election","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris is now the favorite to win the 2024 presidential election, according to several online betting markets.

As of Monday evening, Harris was ahead of Trump by five points on Polymarket. The company, which bills itself as the largest prediction market in the world, saw a record number of bets placed on the 2024 election over the course of July, Bloomberg reported. More than $577 million has been staked on the 2024 election, as of August 12. In June, Trump had a comfortable lead over his Democratic rival, then President Biden, on the Polymarket book. His lead peaked at a 72% chance of winning the election on July 16—in the middle of the Republican National Convention and only three days after the assassination attempt against him in Butler, Pennsylvania. Harris’ lead was even higher on the New Zealand-based PredictIt, which gave her a 59% chance compared to a 44% chance for Trump. These odds were posted before Trump’s primetime interview with Tesla and SpaceX owner Elon Musk on Monday night.

Two unnamed people familiar with the matter told CNN the FBI suspects the hackers breached the personal email account of a senior Trump campaign official in June in an effort to gain access to campaign networks. The FBI also warned President Joe Biden’s campaign—now run by Vice President Kamala Harris—about potential threats from Iranian hackers, CNN reported (the campaign told the outlet it’s “not aware of any security breaches”). The Trump campaign confirmed Saturday it had been hacked—and said Iran was the culprit—after Politico reported it was receiving emails from an “anonymous account with documents from inside Trump’s operation,” including months-old vetting material on Trump’s soon-to-be running mate JD Vance.

Key Background The Trump campaign did not provide any evidence that Iran was behind the attack, but cited a report from Microsoft released last Friday that said Iranian hackers “sent a spear phishing email in June to a high-ranking official on a presidential campaign.” Iran’s mission to the United Nations denied being involved in the hack to the Associated Press, and the U.S. has not publicly accused Iran of hacking Trump’s campaign. However, Avril Haines, the director of National Intelligence, warned in July that “Iran is becoming increasingly aggressive in their foreign influence efforts, seeking to stoke discord and undermine confidence in our democratic institutions.” Microsoft’s report last week seemed to have similar findings, saying it had seen “the emergence of significant influence activity by Iranian actors” over the past several months.

A Trump campaign spokesman told the BBC the documents were illegally obtained by \"foreign sources hostile to the United States\". Iranian officials have denied any connection to the hack and the US government has not formally accused Iran. According to the Washington Post, the FBI probe includes incidents in which members of the Joe Biden-Kamala Harris campaign were also targeted by hackers. The Trump campaign statement came one day after Microsoft released a report indicating that Iranian hackers targeted the campaign of an unnamed US presidential candidate in June. Microsoft’s Threat Analysis Center (MTAC) said that the campaign was sent a spear- phishing email – a message designed to look trustworthy in order to get the target to click on a malicious link. On Saturday, Trump said the hackers were \"only able to get publicly available information\". According to the Washington Post, three staff members of the Biden-Harris campaign were also targeted by phishing emails in the days before President Joe Biden announced that he was quitting the race. A Harris campaign spokesperson said in a statement to the media that the campaign \"vigilantly monitors and protects against cyberthreats, and we are not aware of any security breaches of our systems\". The Biden-Harris campaign was briefed by agents about the attempts back in June, according to CNN. The BBC has asked the Harris campaign for comment. According to the Washington Post, the FBI probe into the hacking attempts was first opened in June. Democratic Congressman Adam Schiff was among several lawmakers calling for the FBI to reveal what it knows about the hacking attempts. He said that the US intelligence community “moved much too slow to properly identity the hacking and dumping scheme carried out by Russia” in 2016 and “should act quickly here”. It comes after Democratic Congressman Eric Swalwell said he was requesting a briefing from the Department of Homeland Security on the \"alleged hack of Trump's presidential campaign\". \"Yes, Trump is the most despicable person ever to seek office. He also sought foreign hacking in a past election... But that doesn’t mean America ever tolerates foreign interference,\" he posted on X/Twitter on Saturday. At campaign rallies in 2016, he asked Russia to hack his opponent in the race, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. US security sources had previously warned of an Iranian plot to assassinate Trump, unconnected to last month’s attempted shooting in Pennsylvania. And on Tuesday, the US justice department charged a Pakistani man alleged to have ties to Iran with plotting to assassinate US officials, potentially including the former president.","summary":"The FBI confirmed it is investigating Trump's claims his campaign was hacked by Iranian agents.","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9znr5vne2o","image":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5b11/live/e3467e00-58fe-11ef-83ae-95b24aaaf5b6.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-12 23:16:11","author":"Max Matza","authors":["Max Matza"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.353},{"id":253976626,"title":"Trump’s Big Lie About Harris’s Crowds","text":"When Donald Trump says something ludicrous and unhinged, it is often difficult to tell if he is acting out of feral political calculation or narcissistic injury. We saw this on Sunday, when he claimed that Kamala Harris had used A.I. to fake an image of an enthusiastic crowd greeting her when she arrived in Michigan. “There was nobody at the plane, and she ‘A.I.’d’ it, and showed a massive ‘crowd’ of so-called followers, BUT THEY DIDN’T EXIST!,” Trump wrote on his vanity website Truth Social. His argument, such as it was, was based on a conspiracy theory floating around febrile corners of the internet that purported to find evidence of Harris’s deception in her plane’s reflection. “Same thing is happening with her fake ‘crowds’ at her speeches,” Trump added. “This is the way the Democrats win Elections, by CHEATING — And they’re even worse at the Ballot Box. She should be disqualified because the creation of a fake image is ELECTION INTERFERENCE.” One way to read this post is that Trump is delusional. He can’t cope with Harris besting him on the metric he’s long valued the most — the size of his audience — and so is denying reality and having a tantrum. But however disordered Trump’s mind might be, I suspect there’s also a sort of strategy at work here.

The Arlington Heights resident is one of thousands of volunteers who will keep the DNC ticking next week. She also recruited dozens of helpers in her role as a neighborhood ambassador for the Chicago 2024 Host Committee. “I really always, always wanted to attend a convention. To me that is a big part of our democracy, these conventions. Just to experience the excitement live is thrilling,” Vogt said. Originally, DNC planners hoped to secure 12,000 volunteers. By mid-July, that goal was surpassed, they announced. “Chicago, Illinois, and the Midwest are beyond excited to host this summer’s convention and there is no clearer proof than today’s massive planning milestone,” Chicago 2024 Executive Director Christy George said in a statement July 10. About 30,000 people showed interest in helping out. Of those selected, 77% are from Illinois, 39% are Chicagoans and many come from the suburbs. Vogt and neighborhood ambassador organizer Daniel Schack of Northbrook said offers of help poured in from towns like Arlington Heights, Buffalo Grove, Glenview, Northbrook, Palatine and Wheeling. And that was before the convention pivoted from the problematic renomination of incumbent President Joe Biden to Vice President and nominee Kamala Harris. “I believe in experiencing as much history as I can,” Vogt said. “It would have been historic anyway just to attend but now … oh my goodness, it is so exciting.” What exactly will volunteers do? Jobs could include greeting guests at O’Hare International Airport, giving directions at venues, checking credentials, driving visitors and helping with food. “It’s really being the face of the convention to a lot of people,” Schack said. “Volunteers are the lifeblood of the convention.” And although there will be glimpses of VIPs, it’s not glamorous work. At the Republican National Convention this July in Milwaukee, a small army of volunteers took shifts standing in the blazing sun outside Fiserv Forum guiding journalists and delegates to the correct entrances. But for DNC volunteers counting down the days to kickoff Monday, it’s a labor of love that’s not about being Democrat or Republican. “People are excited to be part of it,” Schack said. “They recognize the historic nature of showcasing Chicago to the world.” The Neighborhood Ambassador program launched in January and features people deeply involved in their communities. Ambassadors recruited more than 1,400 volunteers from the Chicago region for the DNC. Vogt, who spent 40 years teaching at Thomas Middle School in Arlington Heights and other schools, reached out to friends, community organizations and former students about volunteer openings. She ended up with about 200 signups and won recognition from the host committee for her efforts. “It’s just been a whole community effort to make people aware of the opportunity we all have to get involved,” Vogt said. “I’m just trying to get as many people as excited as I am about wanting to experience this part of our democracy.”","summary":"From drivers, to way-finders to greeters — the DNC needed thousands of volunteers and the region stepped up.","url":"https://www.dailyherald.com/20240812/nation-and-world-politics/face-of-the-convention-dnc-volunteers-getting-front-row-seat-to-history/","image":"https://imengine.public.prod.pdh.navigacloud.com/?uuid=ba663dbb-00a9-5291-88db-c41e1e337812&function=fit&type=preview","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-12 23:00:08","author":"Marni Pyke","authors":["Marni Pyke"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.129},{"id":253974238,"title":"Fox News reporter gets schooled by White House press secretary–again","text":"Fox News' nepo-baby correspondent Peter Doocy got shellacked by White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Monday when he made a clumsy attempt to start beef between Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris and President Joe Biden.

It’s not true.” Doocy kept on digging. “She has a campaign ad where she is saying they need more Border Patrol agents. If President Biden is doing such a good job why do they need more border agents?” Doocy asked before being cut off by Jean-Pierre. The press secretary then reminded him that Biden also wanted more border agents, and would have been able to hire them if Donald Trump and his GOP cohorts weren’t such craven politicians. You know who's getting in the way? You know who is getting in the way? Republicans in Congress. They're getting in the way. You know who else is getting in the way? The former president, Donald Trump. He's getting in the way. I mean, I don't—there's no daylight here. I'm not understanding the question because there's no daylight. The president believes that as well. And he's worked towards doing that. There's a bipartisan—I know you guys probably get sick of me saying this, but there was—there was a bipartisan agreement that was on the table, that the president worked through for a couple of months with Republicans in the Senate, and Democrats. They were told not to move forward, because it would help Joe Biden, by the former president. That's their decision. x x YouTube Video The conservative movement is in a bad place as the Harris-Walz Democratic ticket’s popularity grows and the right-wing landscape’s talking points grow stale. This isn’t the first time Doocy has attempted to create this weird narrative, and it isn’t the first time Jean-Pierre has had to publicly embarrass him for doing so. But something about Monday’s display feels desperate—even for Doocy.","summary":"Fox News' nepo-baby correspondent Peter Doocy got shellacked by White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Monday when he made a clumsy attempt to start beef between Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris and President Joe Biden.\n\n\n\nDuring a press briefing, Doocy attempted to conflate a new set of Harris campaign ads touting border security policies with a criticism of the Biden administration.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“How long have you guys known that Vice President Harris does not think that President Biden is effective with his border policy?” Doocy asked.\n\n\n\n“You’re making a huge jump,” Jean-Pierre responded. “She did not say this.

Time magazine’s cover shows a black-and-white drawing of the vice president’s head surrounded by blue signs. The title on the Time cover is “Her Moment,” written by Charlotte Alter, and is set to be the magazine’s Aug. 26 issue. The magazine posted the cover on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, with the description “The reintroduction of Kamala Harris,” which is the same title as the online version of Alter’s article. “The soundtrack suggested a Beyoncé concert. The light-up bracelets evoked the Eras Tour. And the exuberant crowd—more than 14,000 strong, lining up in the rain—resembled the early days of Barack Obama,” Alter wrote in the opening of the article describing the high energy of a recent Harris campaign rally. She continued, “Inside a Philadelphia arena on Aug. 6, Vice President Kamala Harris was greeted with a kind of reception a Democratic presidential candidate hasn’t gotten in years. Fans packed into overflow spaces, waving homemade signs made of glitter and glue as drumlines roared.” Alter analyzed the transformation of Harris from vice president to the leading Democratic candidate in the 2024 election. “Harris has pulled off the swiftest vibe shift in modern political history. A contest that revolved around the cognitive decline of a geriatric President has been transformed: Joe Biden is out, Harris is in,” she wrote. “Where has this Kamala Harris been all along?” Alter asked. She added, “For years, Democratic officials questioned her political chops, pundits mocked her word salads, and her polling suggested limited appeal. Her performance in the 2020 presidential primary was wooden, and her turn as Biden’s No. 2 did little to inspire confidence.” “She may seem like an overnight sensation, but Harris’ moment was years in the making,” Alter wrote. One political observer called the cover story a rewrite of a New York Times piece on Harris in July. “The Time Magazine piece is almost a beat for beat rewriting from this NY Times piece from July 22nd. It’s even the identical title and uses same design of full splash. No actual work went into it,” a social media user responded. Another social media account called out the magazine for writing a “fawning cover” even though she “REFUSED TO BE INTERVIEWED.” Essence magazine announced the cover of the September-October issue and placed the vice president as its cover photograph. It features a sit-down interview that Harris had done last month during Essence Fest before Biden had stepped down from the presidential election. The Essence story will share the vice president’s views on the Supreme Court, abortion access, and her thoughts on former President Donald Trump.

Trump paints a darker picture. Will mismatched moods matter?","text":"WASHINGTON — At the top of his first speech as her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz turned to Vice President Kamala Harris and declared, “Thank you for bringing back the joy.” The next day, Harris took the theme a step further, branding the Democratic ticket “joyful warriors.” Contrast that with former President Donald Trump, who opened a news conference at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida a few days later by saying, “We have a lot of bad things coming up,” and predicting the U.S. could fall into an economic depression unseen since the dark days of 1929 or even another world war. “I think that our country is, right now, in the most dangerous position it’s ever been in, from an economic standpoint, from a safety standpoint,” Trump said Thursday. Democrats are playing up their sunnier outlook, promoting the idea that voters can be inspired to support someone and not just cast their ballot against the other side. The Trump campaign argues their candidate is reflecting the dour mood of the country and dismisses the idea that a growing contrast in tone and upbeat attitude will decide the presidency. Two-thirds of Americans reported feeling very or somewhat pessimistic about the state of politics, according to polling by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research from last month. Roughly 7 in 10 said things in the country are heading in the wrong direction. Jason Miller, a senior adviser to the former president, said people don’t care about “vibe checks.” “That’s not making gas or food or housing less expensive,” Miller said. WALZ PROMOTES POSITIVITY Still, just how hard Harris is betting on the opposite approach is evident in her decision to pick Walz, whose personal story includes being on the coaching staff of a high school football team that had gone winless just a few years earlier to clinching a state championship in 1999. The Minnesota governor’s relentless positivity is meant to give supporters a jolt of new energy and keep the momentum that Harris has built after President Biden – facing mounting pressure from within his own party and increasingly pessimistic views about his chances in November – stepped aside and endorsed his vice president. Walz spent his first week as Harris’ running mate traveling to swing states with Harris and underscored the point during a rally in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, celebrating what he said was “the ability to talk about what can be good.” “This idea of caring for our neighbor and kindness, and a hand up when somebody needs it. And just the sense that people go through things and to be able to be there when they need it, that’s who we are,” he said. “It’s not about mocking. It’s not name-calling.” Biden often ended his speeches saying he’d never been more optimistic. But he built his now-shuttered reelection bid around branding Trump an existential threat to democracy. The president offered dire predictions about the former president, suggesting he’d dismantle the nation’s founding principles should he retake the White House. Harris’ campaign still relies on many of the same themes, decrying Trump as a threat to democracy, warning that he’ll impose draconian limits to abortion and voting and that he will follow Project 2025, a plan championed by top conservatives to remake large swaths of the federal government. And despite Walz insisting that smiles were more powerful than insults, he and Harris have continued their share of denunciations, decrying Trump’s conviction in New York on 34 felony counts in a hush-money case and his being found liable for fraudulent business practices and sexual abuse in civil court. Still, even before she named Walz her running mate, Harris was suggesting that she could help make politics fun again. “We love our country. And I believe it is the highest form of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country,” Harris declared in campaign speeches before picking Walz. She now tells crowds that she and her running mate “both believe in lifting people up, not knocking them down.” Paula Montagna, who went to see Harris and Walz at a rally outside Detroit last week, highlighted the shift in messaging since Harris took over from Biden. “Kamala is so positive, and it’s nice to hear positive instead of negative,” Montagna said. Trump team says their candidate is reflecting reality Trump’s senior campaign advisers counter that the mood of the country right now is sour over the economy, the state of the U.S.-Mexico border and turmoil in the Middle East and beyond. They see their candidate as reflecting that reality rather than what they believe is a temporary exuberance igniting the Democratic base after months of discouragement over their ticket. Trump has tried to harness that with his repeated predictions of stock market crashes and war. His campaign appearances have included a long list of other warnings that have veered into the apocalyptic, saying that if he’s not elected, “we’re not going to have a country anymore,” that “the only thing standing between you and its obliteration is me,” and that under a Harris administration, “Social Security will buckle and collapse” and “the suburbs will be overrun with violent crime and savage foreign gangs.” During his Republican National Convention speech last month, where his advisers said Trump would seem changed and more personal after surviving an attempted assassination, the former president did strike a different tone – at least to start. He said early on that he had “a message of confidence, strength and hope” and sought to “launch a new era of safety, prosperity and freedom for citizens of every race, religion, color and creed.” But by the end, Trump had returned to predictions of doom, twice warning, “Bad things are going to happen.” Ohio Sen. JD Vance, Trump’s running mate, has drawn a sharp contrast with Walz. Vance has been cheered on the right for being an aggressive fighter on behalf of the former president, particularly when engaging with reporters. “Right now, I am angry about what Kamala Harris has done to this country and done to the American southern border,” Vance said at a campaign stop in Michigan. “And I think most people in our country, they can be happy-go-lucky sometimes, they can enjoy things sometimes, and they can turn on the news and recognize that what’s going on in this country is a disgrace.” Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, not himself known for a sunny disposition, offered much the same assessment Friday at a conservative conference in Atlanta hosted by radio host Erick Erickson. “The country is obviously in a bad mood,” McConnell said. Trump supporters waiting to see him at a rally in Bozeman, Montana, said they felt the former president’s campaign made them feel positive – even if his message often isn’t. “Just looking at the state of the country now, I don’t think Kamala Harris’ campaign is one of joy and hope. I think that’s Trump’s campaign,” said Alex Lustig, a 23-year-old from Billings, Montana. Fred Scarlett, a 63-year-old retiree from Condon, Montana, said that “everyone understands that we need to be here to support Trump because he has never let us down.” “They shoot at him,” Scarlett said, “and he still keeps firing back.”","summary":"WASHINGTON — At the top of his first speech as her running mate, Minnesota Gov.

Recent outrages in Gotham alone will make your hair stand up, yet the perps not only get to remain in America but are often set free to terrorize everyone else. Time and time again. It’s pure insanity. Take Yohenry Brito. An “asylum-seeking” thug from Venezuela arrested and released in three separate thefts, Brito went on to lead a gang of fellow migrants in a vicious beatdown of two NYPD cops. Yes — cops! Was he deported? Nope. Locked behind bars? Nope. So Brito was free to rob two Sephora stores in just the past few weeks, cops say. Surely this menace deserves to be sent home yesterday — remember, he has no right to be here in the first place; the Biden-Harris team has merely “paroled” him. Yet don’t be surprised if he’s freed yet again. Or consider the horrifying knifepoint rape in Coney Island Sunday. David Davon-Bonilla, a Nicaraguan migrant, pleaded guilty to a savage sexual assault last year. Yet somehow he, too, was allowed to remain here — and even set free. And on Sunday, he allegedly threw a 46-year-old woman to the ground and raped her at knifepoint. Meanwhile, his alleged accomplice, migrant Leovando Mereno, smashed her boyfriend with a pipe when he intervened, sources say. Sunday also brought a stabbing amid mayhem outside the Randall’s Island migrant shelter. Then there’s Venezuelan migrant Daniel Hernandez Martinez, a poster boy for migrant crime, nabbed repeatedly on dozens of charges and released every time. It’s bad enough that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris insist on “paroling” so many illegal migrants; it’s insane that violating that parole by committing new crimes has no consequences. Migrant criminals should get shipped out immediately, or at least locked behind bars. Not given a second, third and even fourth chance. That some countries won’t accept them back is no excuse: Team Biden-Harris secretly dumps migrants in places like Westchester; it can at least try to ship criminals to their native countries, which have no qualms about having them infiltrate the United States. If not, hold them until they can be sent back — and if the feds don’t have the detention capacity, build more. Of course, Kamala Harris once vowed she’d “absolutely” close all privately run immigration detention centers (which is most of them) “on Day 1” if elected president; she also backed abolishing ICE. Now that she’s the Democratic nominee, her aides say she’s abandoned those positions — but she hasn’t rejected the “parole them all” approach of the administration that’s she’s still serving in. If you want more migrant-crime madness, vote Harris-Walz.","summary":"Migrant thugs keep getting arrested and freed when they should be deported or at least locked up to prevent more migrant-crime madness.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/12/opinion/stop-giving-migrant-thugs-endless-chances-deport-them-or-lock-them-up-now/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/yohenry-brito-24-migrant-held-76841870-e1723503004686.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-12 22:50:17","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.455},{"id":253975270,"title":"Nolte: Poll — 59% Believe America Is in a Recession","text":"Thanks to brutal inflation and equally brutal interest rates brought on by brutally stupid Biden-Harris economic policies, 59 percent of Americans believe this country is in a recession. And thanks to the fact that there is a Democrat in the White House, CNBC is working very hard to tell that 59 percent they are wrong. “The U.S. economy has remained remarkably strong even amid persistent inflation and high interest rates,” writes CNBC. “And yet, 59% of Americans falsely believe that the U.S. is currently in a recession, according to a recent survey of 2,000 adults[.]” “Citing higher costs and difficulty making ends meet, most respondents said they think a recession started roughly 15 months ago,” the report continues, “ and could last until July 2025[.]” It’s fine to claim we are not in recession, but to claim the economy has remained remarkably strong when the first quarter GDP grew at just 1.3 percent is a little ridiculous. We have been told the second quarter of 2024 grew by 2.8 percent, but that could be revised to be lower in September. The problem for this 59 percent is that they are experiencing a personal recession. What the hell good is a 2.8 percent GDP to them when gas costs close to $3.50 a gallon and accumulated inflation has exploded the cost of groceries by more than 25 percent? Then there’s the cost of housing, which has hit a record high. That’s the big three right there: housing, energy, and food. If you’re an everyday working person, that’s the pain you feel every day. And that pain is real. Shopping for groceries is demoralizing. Filling your gas tank is depressing. How does the GDP or the stock market relieve that pain? Trust me, it doesn’t. And for the media to dismiss the way nearly 60 percent of people feel with all this happy talk about the economy is really something. Don’t you get it? It’s a “vibecession,” y’all: We’re in a “vibecession,” Joyce Chang, JPMorgan’s chair of global research, said at the CNBC Financial Advisor Summit in May. Over the last few years “the wealth creation was concentrated amongst homeowners and upper-income brackets,” Chang said, “but you probably have about one-third of the population that’s been left out of that — that’s why there’s such a disconnect.” One-third? CNBC’s own poll says 59 percent. Wages cannot keep up with this inflation. People are taking on record credit card debt. I’m 58 years old, and this is the worst economy I can remember living through. And don’t forget the impact on our economy after Joe Biden and Kamala Harris opened our southern border. Millions and millions of illegals are competing with legal citizens and immigrants for housing and jobs. Of course, that increases housing. Of course, that drives down wages. It also increases the cost of everything — energy, food, etc. — because the more people who want something, the more expensive it is. Some 22 million people should not even be here competing with us.

His Campaign Wants Their Own Docs to Stay Private","text":"In July 2016, then-candidate Donald Trump called on the Russian government to hack the emails of his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. It wouldn’t be long before the scandal of Russian election interference would dominate headlines for much of the campaign and Trump’s presidency. And Trump has since claimed that his public call — for Russians to “find the 30,000 emails” so that “our press” could have a field day — was somehow a joke. But in the intervening years, the former and perhaps future leader of the free world has provided ample evidence that he wasn’t, well, joking at all. In a 2019 interview with ABC, the then-sitting president explicitly stated that “I think I’d take it,” when asked if he would accept dirt on a political opponent that was offered up to him by a foreign power. Trump only added he’d “go maybe to the FBI” if he thought “there was something wrong.” Today, the shoe is entirely on the other foot, with Trump and his campaign now the victims of an alleged foreign hacking and leaking operation during the most crucial months of a close American presidential contest. This time, it doesn’t seem to be Russia. Team Trump is pointing the finger at Iran; Rolling Stone has yet to independently verify that claim. The FBI is investigating the alleged hack. According to two sources familiar with the matter, the Trump team has been scrambling to assess the extent of the damage, and how, exactly, the apparent hacking may affect different facets of the Trumpworld elite, not just the presidential campaign’s staff. “It’s very scary stuff,” one source close to Trump, who has been communicating with campaign officials in recent days about the alleged hacking operation, succinctly notes to Rolling Stone. Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung claimed in a statement that Iran was responsible for the apparent hack of a senior campaign staffer’s internal communications. No outlet has published any leaked documents yet. Cheung preemptively criticized any journalists who dare to report on them. “Any media or news outlet reprinting documents or internal communications are doing the bidding of America’s enemies and doing exactly what they want,” he said. That’s a radical departure from 2016, when Trump openly called on Russia to hack and release Clinton’s emails. “Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,” Trump said at a press conference. “I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.” Russian actors reportedly targeted Clinton’s campaign and personal office on or around that same day. Trump argued the source of the Clinton campaign materials shouldn’t matter — the content was more important. In October 2016, Trump complained that the hacked emails released by WikiLeaks were not getting enough coverage from reporters. “Very little pick-up by the dishonest media of incredible information provided by WikiLeaks,” he posted on X (formerly Twitter). The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment on Monday asking whether the former president still believes that it is acceptable for media outlets and political candidates to cover and highlight a campaign’s internal documents or communications if they were hacked. News of the hack comes at a time when Trump is mired in the final two-and-a-half-month blitz of his 2024 crusade to retake the White House. It’s an election with remarkably high stakes for the American public — and for Trump personally. The outcome of the race between him and Vice President Kamala Harris won’t merely decide whether Trump gets a chance at implementing his increasingly authoritarian vision for the nation. Election Day in November could very well determine whether or not Trump ever faces actual prison time. And it’s in this environment in which a foreign actor, allegedly the Iranian government, is trying to mess with Trump’s electoral chances at returning to power. Iranian officials are still furious with Trump for, among other things, blowing up Qasem Soleimani, and have wanted vengeance for years. However this alleged attack by Iran on the Trump team’s private communications shakes out, it will be done in the shadow of years of MAGAland openly gloating and mocking elite Democrats for getting breached by Russian hackers. For instance, in December 2016, senior veterans of the Trump and Hillary Clinton campaigns gathered at Harvard University, to make first-draft-of-history-style presentations for the assembled crowd and journalists. With the wounds of 2016 still fresh, the event quickly devolved into chaotic sniping, insults, and hurt feelings. At one point, when the issue of Russian election interference, which was designed to help Trump win, came out, Trump lieutenant Brad Parscale told the lineup of Clinton officials that there was such a thing as two-step verification for email accounts… and that maybe Democrats should try it.

Reporters, photographers and video journalists representing The Associated Press and other news organizations who either traveled with Vice President Harris or were on the airport tarmac documented the crowd size last Wednesday as she arrived on Air Force Two. Harris’ campaign also denied the photo in question was manipulated and posted about it on social media. Fifteen thousand people attended the Detroit airport rally, Harris’ campaign said. Harris and Walz spoke from inside a hangar where people were packed in. The crowd also spilled out onto the tarmac. The Wayne County Airport Authority, which oversees the airport, referred questions about the size of the crowd to Harris’ campaign. Thousands of people have been showing up at her campaign rallies. By the Harris campaign’s count, 12,000 people turned out for rallies in Philadelphia and Eau Claire, Wisconsin, last week, followed by 15,000 in Glendale, Arizona. In Las Vegas on Saturday, more than 12,000 people were inside a university arena when law enforcement halted admission because people were getting ill waiting outside in the extreme 109-degree heat. About 4,000 people were waiting in line when the doors were closed. An Associated Press reporter who covered the Harris events in Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona and Nevada, witnessed the throngs of people in attendance. Trump pushed his false claims in back-to-back posts on his social media site on Sunday. “Has anyone noticed that Kamala CHEATED at the airport? There was nobody at the plane, and she ‘A.I.’d’ it, and showed a massive ‘crowd’ of so-called followers, BUT THEY DIDN’T EXIST!.” he wrote. He included a post from another individual who made similar allegations about photo manipulation. A minute later Trump posted, “Look, we caught her with a fake ‘crowd.’ There was nobody there!” He included a photo of the crowd that was partly shaded and partly exposed to the sun. Harris’ campaign confirmed on Monday that the photo being questioned was taken by a staff member and was not in any way modified using AI. Hany Farid, a University of California, Berkeley, professor who focuses on digital forensics and misinformation, analyzed the photo using two models trained to detect patterns of generative AI and found no evidence of manipulation. The models were developed by GetReal Labs, a company Farid co-founded. Farid, responding Monday in an email, said he compared several versions of the photo and the only alteration he detected was some simple change to brightness or contrast, and perhaps sharpening. He said many other images and videos from the event last Wednesday show the same basic scene. Trump started pushing false theories about the Harris campaign photo a few days after he held a news conference at his Florida estate on Thursday and was asked about the crowds at his Democratic rival’s rallies. Trump said no one draws crowds as big as he does. “I’ve spoken to the biggest crowds. Nobody’s spoken to crowds bigger than me,” Trump claimed at the news conference, his first since Harris became the Democratic presidential nominee. He went on to falsely compare the crowd at his speech in front of the White House on Jan. 6, 2021, to the crowd at Martin Luther King Jr.’s famous “I Have a Dream” speech on Aug. 28, 1963, at the Lincoln Memorial. But King drew far more people. Approximately 250,000 people attended the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, at which King gave his speech, according to the National Park Service. The Associated Press reported in 2021 that there were at least 10,000 people at Trump’s address. Some of Trump’s top advisers and supporters have been urging the former president to focus his criticisms on Harris’ policies and talk more about the border and the economy. “Stop questioning the size of her crowds,” was the advice former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., offered during a Fox News appearance on Monday. The Harris campaign needled Trump on a variety of issues in an email Monday titled “9 Days Since Trump’s Last Swing State Event.” The note included a bullet point that said, “he’s very mad about crowd sizes, claiming it’s all fake and AI-generated.

(Photo by KAMIL KRZACZYNSKI / AFP) (Photo by KAMIL KRZACZYNSKI/AFP via Getty Images) AFP via Getty Images The selection of Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as Kamala Harris’s running mate has temporarily extended the honeymoon that the Democratic presidential nominee is enjoying in the polls. However, this boost may be short-lived, as Walz’s progressive track record on climate and energy policy could prove a liability with swing voters. Harris may have erred by choosing Walz—whose positions on climate change are more left-leaning than her own—over Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro. Shapiro would have bolstered Harris’s chances of winning the critical battleground state of Pennsylvania. As governor of one of the largest natural gas-producing states in the country, Shapiro also could have helped Harris walk back her past anti-fossil fuel stances, including her opposition to fracking—the technology that has driven the U.S. shale gas boom over the past 15 years. But that opportunity has passed. Walz’s aggressive push to reduce Minnesota’s dependence on fossil fuels and his unwavering commitment to renewable energy put him at odds with voters who favor an all-of-the-above energy strategy. This approach is unlikely to resonate in Pennsylvania—or in other swing states that will decide the outcome of the election. Climate change has been a consistent theme throughout Walz’s political career. Last year, he signed a law requiring all Minnesota power plants to transition to 100% climate-friendly energy sources, such as wind and solar, by 2040. As a member of Congress, he voted in favor of the 2009 cap-and-trade bill, which would have capped emissions economy-wide. That legislation could have constrained the shale boom that has helped keep energy affordable by increasing extraction costs for oil and gas producers. Since becoming governor of Minnesota in 2018, Walz has made climate issues a top priority. He signed an executive order to establish a subcabinet focused on reducing emissions and addressing climate change. He also pushed through legislation to accelerate the permitting process for renewable energy projects, expand training for clean energy workers, and increase subsidies for electric vehicles.

It’s no surprise that Walz’s selection has sparked enthusiasm among climate-focused progressives within the Democratic Party. However, the real test is how far that enthusiasm will carry the Harris-Walz ticket in November. Polls indicate that environmental policy ranks low among the issues most important to voters this year—trailing behind the economy, inflation, foreign policy, and reproductive rights. An electoral strategy that hinges on mobilizing young climate advocates rather than converting disaffected Republicans and undecided moderates is a significant gamble. When the Harris honeymoon inevitably ends, Democrats will confront some harsh realities. The biggest risk is that the U.S. economy could enter a recession in the coming months. Financial experts haven’t been this concerned about an economic slowdown since early 2023. In a sluggish economy, the focus will quickly shift to affordable energy. Voters’ attention will turn to gasoline prices at the pump, electric bills, and heating costs. This underscores the importance of maintaining and growing U.S. oil and gas production to keep energy affordable and help tame inflation for American consumers. Gasoline prices were lower under President Donald Trump between 2017 and 2021 than during the Biden-Harris administration. Trump’s “energy dominance” policy prioritized affordability over curbing carbon emissions. The Trump campaign will undoubtedly continue to highlight this contrast in the final months of the race. Harris and Walz will have the climate change lane all to themselves—whether that’s an advantage or a liability remains to be seen. Their base may respond positively to this message, but the real question is how well it will resonate with swing voters and moderate Republicans searching for an alternative to Trump.

Tim Walz is branching out this week and holding his first solo events as Vice President Kamala Harris ’ running mate, making a five-state dash for campaign cash and addressing a key union gathering. Walz will speak Tuesday at the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees convention in Los Angeles before headlining a campaign fundraiser in Newport Beach, California. The 1.4-million-member union has endorsed Harris. “With all the anxiety and uncertainty in the country, we have a responsibility to bring people together around common values,” AFSCME President Lee Saunders said in his convention keynote address on Monday. Then referring to top Republicans, he added, “Instead, antiworker forces have decided to double down on the most extreme, divisive agenda you can imagine.” On Wednesday, Walz will address fundraisers in Denver and Boston, and he’ll do more of the same on Thursday in Newport, Rhode Island, and Southampton, New York. Walz’s focus on fundraising this week comes after he stormed through a series of battleground states with Harris last week to introduce himself to voters nationally. The two held rallies in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona and Nevada. Ohio Sen. JD Vance, who was announced as Republican Donald Trump ‘s running mate during the GOP convention in Milwaukee, had his own rollout largely overshadowed by unforeseen events. It came after an assassination attempt against the former president the previous weekend and before President Biden abandoned his reelection bid and endorsed Harris during the following one. Walz has salted his early campaign appearances with talk of joy and positivity, stressing that he and Harris are championing being kind and neighborly. But he has frequently laid into Trump’s policies and the former president’s 34 felony counts in a New York hush money case. Vance, meanwhile, has leaned more heavily into the traditional No. 2 role of lobbing political attacks on the opposition. He spent much of last week holding his own events in the same states that Harris and Walz visited and arguing the Democratic ticket was too ultra-liberal for most Americans. The senator has also suggested that Harris chose Walz over another contender for running mate, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, because Shapiro’s public support for Israel in its war with Hamas might have angered some progressives. Vance said picking Walz meant that Harris took advice from the “Hamas wing of her party.” He also criticized Walz’s military record, arguing that his retirement ahead of his National Guard Unit’s deployment to Iraq and his implication that he had served in a combat zone suggested “stolen valor garbage.” Over the weekend, the Harris campaign said that Walz “misspoke” when he referenced “weapons of war that I carried in war.” Orange County Republican Party Chairman Fred Whitaker, picked up on charges that Walz has been imprecise with his characterizations of his military service, saying in a statement Monday that the governor, “may walk away heavy with campaign cash from liberal donors but he will leave with the same empty and fake record he came in with.” Vance has also faulted Harris and Walz for not sitting for media interviews. When his plane coincided with Harris’ on a tarmac in Wisconsin, where both sides held events last week, Vance began walking toward the vice president’s motorcade, saying he wanted to talk to reporters traveling with her since she’d not done it herself. Harris has yet to sit for a major interview since Biden left the race but has said she wants to do that later in the month. She briefly took questions from the press traveling with her twice during her battleground travels last week – something Walz did not do, except for one session, answering questions off-the-record, which meant his answers couldn’t be publicly shared. Vance has appeared on a variety of podcasts angling to appeal to a younger voter set. At age 40, he’s closer to that demographic than any of the other three top-of-the-ticket contenders. Trump is 78, Harris is 59 and Walz is 60.","summary":"The Minnesota governor is attending fundraisers this week in California, Colorado, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and New York.","url":"https://www.centralmaine.com/2024/08/12/walz-is-making-a-5-state-dash-for-campaign-cash-traveling-solo-for-1st-time-as-harris-running-mate/","image":"https://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/Election_2024_Harris_77987_2e885b-1723502826.jpg?w=1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-12 22:36:39","author":"Will Weissert,WILL WEISSERT - Associated Press","authors":["Will Weissert","WILL WEISSERT - Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0},{"id":253973570,"title":"Trump falsely claims a crowd photo from Harris’ campaign rally in Detroit was created using AI","text":"By DARLENE SUPERVILLE, Associated Press WASHINGTON (AP) — Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has been spreading false claims that an image of thousands of people waiting at Detroit’s airport as Democrat Kamala Harris arrived for a campaign rally was fabricated with the help of artificial intelligence.

The face-off between Vice President Kamala Harris, representing the Democratic Party, and the Republican former president Donald Trump was set by ABC News for September 10. In response to the upcoming debate, VMA chiefs shifted their star-studded event to September 11. Paramount+ announced on Monday: \"In observance of the 23rd anniversary of 9/11, MTV will again support the non-profit 9/11 Day, which organises the September 11 National Day of Service and Remembrance, and Tuesday's Children, which serves the families of 9/11.\" The VMAs will feature performances from US singer Sabrina Carpenter, Cuban-born sensation and former Fifth Harmony member Camila Cabello, and American artist Chappell Roan. The Espresso singer is up for six awards this year, while Chappell celebrates her first-ever VMA nod. Topping the list for the 2024 nominations is none other than US megastar Taylor Swift with an impressive 10 nominations. Taylor has received eight nominations for her collaboration with Post Malone on Fortnight. Post himself boasts nine nominations, with eight for Fortnight and another for best collaboration for his track I Had Some Help, featuring Morgan Wallen. Taylor is in the running for Artist of the Year against Ariana Grande, Bad Bunny, Eminem, Carpenter, and SZA. She's also up against Sabrina for song of the year, competing with Teddy Swims, Jack Harlow, Beyonce, and Kendrick Lamar. Love Story singer Taylor swept the board at last year's ceremony, bagging nine awards and boosting her VMA trophy count to a whopping 23. However, Beyonce still leads with an impressive haul of 28 gongs. The glitzy awards show is set to kick off at 1am UK time on Thursday, September 11, taking place at the UBS Arena in New York's Long Island. In a move that disappointed fans last year, Paramount+ pulled the plug on the MTV Europe Music Awards (EMAs) scheduled in Paris, citing the \"volatility of world events\" amidst tensions in Israel and the Gaza Strip. Meanwhile, Manchester is gearing up to host the EMAs for the first time ever, with a star-studded bash planned at the new Co-op Live arena on November 10.

Tim Walz will make an evening stop in Boston this week as part of a three-day multi-state tour he’s undertaking to raise cash for the Harris-Walz presidential campaign. Walz, who is running for the vice presidency alongside current-VP Kamala Harris, will arrive in the midst of a “national travel and fundraising blitz” that includes stops in California, Colorado, New York, Rhode Island, and the Bay State. “On Tuesday, August 13, in his first solo Harris-Walz campaign event as Vice President Harris’ running mate, Governor Tim Walz will travel to Los Angeles, California, where he will deliver remarks at the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) 2024 convention,” the campaign wrote. Walz will deliver remarks in Boston on Wednesday after a morning stop in Denver, Colorado, and ahead of events scheduled for Thursday in Newport, Rhode Island, and South Hampton, New York. Excepting the first event in California on Tuesday, each stop is billed as a “Harris-Walz campaign reception” with no precise start time or location provided. According to the State House News Service, the Boston event will be hosted by Former U.S. Ambassador Alan Solomont and his wife, philanthropist Susan Solomont, at an unnamed Back Bay hotel. Attendees will need to cough up $25,000 to get in the door, with a suggest donation of $100,000. The tour, according to the campaign, will allow the former high school teacher to connect with fellow union members and speak about his pro-worker record. “Governor Walz, a former union member himself, has a strong record of standing up for unions and delivering for workers — from joining the picket line and passing the most pro-worker package of laws in Minnesota history, to guaranteeing Minnesota workers paid sick, medical, and family leave,” the campaign said. Wednesday’s fundraiser in Boston, the campaign said, will not be open to the press or public but will be covered by “an editorial print pooler.”","summary":"Walz, who is running for the vice presidency alongside current-VP Kamala Harris, will arrive in Boston in the midst of a “national travel and fundraising blitz\" that includes stops in California, Colorado, New York, Rhode Island, and the Bay State.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2024/08/12/tim-walz-will-take-the-harris-show-on-a-solo-tour-with-scheduled-stop-in-boston/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/AP24224067821019.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-12 22:31:28","author":"Matthew Medsger","authors":["Matthew Medsger"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.267},{"id":253975498,"title":"Something Is Wrong","text":"From the Boiling Frogs on The Dispatch For the second time in this campaign, a party won’t face the fact that there’s something seriously wrong with its nominee for president. And not just the party. His detractors are guilty of it too. Critics like me routinely insist that Donald Trump is crazy, yet we seldom treat that as the most compelling reason to oppose his candidacy. How many times, for instance, have I complained about his nationalist policies or authoritarian politics relative to his obviously deepening psychological fragility? I thought of that this weekend when an argument broke out among conservatives over David French’s case for supporting Kamala Harris. Lost in the debate over which candidate’s agenda would be slightly more Reaganite than the other’s or whether the culture of the GOP would improve after a Trump defeat is this momentous yet almost too-basic-to-ask question: Is Trump in touch with reality? My own argument for supporting Harris—that she’s the only one of the two who hasn’t attempted a coup—also somehow overlooks the threshold matter of why we would trust the world’s most important job to someone who’s plainly more unbalanced today than he was in 2016 or 2020. It’s understandable that pundits would have this blind spot. We know more about policy and politics than about psychology, so that’s the ground we fight on. I can tell you why Trump’s pro-tariff, anti-immigration program would be inflationary or why stocking the executive branch with cultish MAGA loyalists would threaten the constitutional order. But I can’t diagnose the peculiar habits of thinking that make him who he is. And the hard truth is that after nine years, those peculiar habits seem less peculiar than they once did. The idea of America being led by a person as psychologically frail as Trump has been normalized. We’re all frogs in a pot that’s been slowly brought to a boil. But we should pay more attention to the fact that something is wrong with him. And I think we will, including millions of Republicans who are no more eager to face the truth about their nominee than Democrats were to face the truth about Joe Biden. We’ll have no choice: With Harris suddenly ahead in polling, in fundraising, and in enthusiasm, Trump’s confidence in his own popularity is being tested more severely than at any point since the aftermath of the 2020 election. He couldn’t cope then and he’s not coping well now. The more the race gets away from him, the more obvious his fragility will become. Reasoning and unreason. The silliest spectacle in politics this month has been Republicans pleading with Trump to get back on message, as if he’s somehow forgotten that inflation and immigration are his strongest lines of attack against Harris. He didn’t forget. And he assuredly does want to win. He’s off-message because he can’t help himself. There’s something wrong with him. The New York Times reported this weekend on a dinner he held with wealthy donors in New York on August 2. “Some guests hoped Mr. Trump would signal that he was recalibrating after a series of damaging mistakes,” the paper noted. Instead he babbled about stolen elections, repeated his “black or Indian?” critique of Harris, and assured the crowd that he’s “not nicer” following the attempt on his life last month that had supposedly left him a changed man. One attendee told the New York Post’s Charles Gasparino that when a donor advised him to tone down some of his attacks, Trump replied, “They tried to put me in jail; they tried to ruin my reputation and then they tried to assassinate me. At some point, you have [to] be truthful to yourself.” Being true to himself is the whole problem. His advisers are “deeply rattled by his meandering, mean and often middling public performances since the failed assassination attempt,” per Axios. One source claimed that Trump “is struggling to get past his anger,” the sort of thing one might say about a temperamental child (no wonder), not the nominee of a major party fewer than 100 days out from an election. Trump being undisciplined and self-indulgent isn’t news, though, any more than him resorting to childish cruelty toward his enemies is. What’s newsy is how his anxiety about Harris’ surging popularity has led him into outright fantasy to try to explain it. Last week she was received by a huge crowd at the airport in Detroit when Air Force Two touched down. Reporters were there, including those from the Times and Washington Post, and numerous attendees posted video of her arrival on social media. Adoring crowds have been par for the course for Harris so far, partly because—very strangely for an incumbent VP—she’s the “change candidate” in the race and partly because Old Man Biden’s departure has popped the valve on an enormous reserve of pent-up enthusiasm among Democrats. Yet some MAGA Republicans can’t bring themselves to believe it. One tweet viewed nearly 5 million times this weekend claimed, “BREAKING: It’s being reported that EVERY SINGLE person at the Kamala rally was paid, carefully vetted and the majority were flown in. It was invite [only] and not open to the public. They’re all paid actors.” But what really got the hive buzzing was when right-wing provocateur Dinesh D’Souza and others flagged a picture of Harris’ plane at the rally and claimed that reflections in the fuselage proved that the crowd … simply wasn’t there. Insane, but social media usually is. The difference this time is that the insanity was picked up and promoted by Trump himself: Note the line about the “same thing” supposedly happening at the raucous rallies that were carried live on cable news all last week to millions of viewers. After posting the bit above, he posted another photo of Harris’ arrival in Detroit with the caption, “Look, we caught her with a fake ‘crowd.’ There was nobody there!” The photo shows, er, a huge crowd. The temptation whenever Trump does something that appears strategically indefensible is to pause and wonder what he might be intuiting that you, the pedestrian political observer, are missing. He won the presidency once, nearly won it a second time, and is no worse than a 50-50 shot to win it this fall. He must know something. I myself am not above interpreting his desperate tantrums as cunning ploys aimed at enticing some constituency or another. But this is what I mean when I say that pundits aren’t well equipped to analyze him. What we strain to explain as a matter of politics or policy is more persuasively explained by other fields: He thinks Harris’ crowd was “AI” and is willing to say so publicly, in the thick of a presidential campaign as undecided voters eye him warily, because there’s something wrong with him. That’s all there is to it. He can’t cope psychologically with the reality that Americans might prefer her to him and this is the best he can do to process it. The crowds aren’t real. Popularity and insecurity. Losing a popularity contest always triggers his most manic lunges into fantasy. His first 24 hours as president were consumed with crowd sizes, you may recall. He sent his new press secretary at the time, Sean Spicer, out to declare that it was “the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period,” even though overhead photos of the Washington Mall from 2009 clearly showed Barack Obama’s audience was much bigger. That lie was so brazen that Spicer expressed regret about it after leaving the administration. A few days after being sworn in, Trump held a reception at the White House for congressional leaders. He opened his remarks not by detailing his agenda or emphasizing areas of common ground between the parties, but by relitigating the 2016 election. He was insecure about the fact that Hillary Clinton had received more votes than him and assured Nancy Pelosi and the gang that Clinton’s margins must have been padded by millions of illegal ballots cast by illegal immigrants. Enough has been written about the 2020 election and its aftermath, here and elsewhere, that we needn’t revisit it except to say that it’s the most manic and destructive Trump’s ever been when confronted with proof that he’s less popular than someone else. But it’s notable that he reacted the same way in the past after losing contests with far lower stakes. Just a few days ago, at his press conference at Mar-a-Lago, he claimed that the crowd at his rally on January 6 was bigger than the crowd on the Mall for Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech in 1963. It was a preposterous, easily debunked lie—but he apparently couldn’t help telling it because even that truth is too hard for him to handle. His “AI” theory of Harris’ crowds is in line with all of those examples, and it is probably the closest he’s come to the degree of mania he evinced during the “Stop the Steal” campaign after the last election. (Among the many Harris crowd truthers this weekend was Sidney Powell, not coincidentally.) Facing an opponent whose fans are as enthusiastic as his own is a new experience for him politically. And that enthusiasm can’t easily be spun: Unlike the methodology of a poll, the evidence of “Kamalamentum” is based on voters’ own eyes and ears while watching one of her rallies. The fact that Trump would try to spin it anyway by insisting that her crowds are “fake” can’t be explained in strategic terms, then. Most who hear his “AI” theory will think he’s nuts. The rest are already committed to him, so grumbling about it does him far more harm than good. It can only be explained as a coping mechanism by someone who wants to lead the free world yet is so fragile psychologically that he routinely resorts to outlandish conspiracy theories to process events that wound his ego. On Friday his former National Security Adviser, John Bolton, turned up on CNN and was asked why Trump lied so often during his Mar-a-Lago press conference last week. He didn’t lie, Bolton replied. To accuse him of deliberate falsehood is to misunderstand how his mind works: That’s precisely my theory of how Trump reacted to the outcome of the 2020 election. It’s not that he sincerely believed the election was rigged or that he knowingly lied about being cheated to justify his coup plot. It’s that he understands reality as a set of circumstances in which he gets his way and then works backward from that conclusion to ascertain what’s “true” and what’s “false.” If he doesn’t get his way, as happened in 2020, then that can’t be real. He’s not lying when he says he believes the election was stolen, in other words. But he also didn’t arrive at that belief the way a normal person does—by examining evidence with a degree of objectivity to try to discern what’s true and what isn’t. Reality for him is entirely subjective. His case that the election was stolen is ultimately no more and no less than that he lost a popularity contest and that’s not possible. His fantasy about Harris’ “AI” crowd is a classic example of his pathology. Trump is watching her rallies and confronting the unsettling possibility that her fans are more enthusiastic than his are. He wants that enthusiasm to not be real—and so it isn’t. The copious video, photographs, and eyewitness accounts of the crowd in Detroit are neither here nor there. It’s AI. In his own way, he believes it. Needless to say, a candidate who can’t separate observable truth from his own wishcasting will also struggle to understand why he shouldn’t share a lunatic theory that Harris’ crowds are computer-generated with the public. It’s as plausible an account of what happened in Detroit as any other, no? I can bark at you all day about not voting for coup-plotters, and David French can make endless elegant arguments about why conservatism is better off if Trump loses. But all anyone needs to know to prefer the Democrat this fall is that we shouldn’t risk having a president (again) who cannot cope with reality when it becomes emotionally difficult. Harris 2024: There’s something wrong with him. Taunts as strategy. Reading all of that, you might wonder if it isn’t to Democrats’ strategic advantage to stoke Trump’s mania by needling him about his insecurities. It is, and they are. One clip posted by the Harris campaign on his own Truth Social platform features her running mate, Gov. Tim Walz, mocking Trump for caring about crowd size. Another goofs on him for maintaining a decidedly “low energy” campaign schedule. The logic of taunting him was summarized efficiently by New York magazine’s Jonathan Chait: “Losing to Harris is making Trump crazier, and being crazy is making him lose. The Trump death spiral.” The more insecure he feels, the more he’ll lash out and expose his own abnormality, and the more he lashes out and exposes his abnormality, the more he’ll alienate swing voters. Then his polls will dip and he’ll feel more insecure. And the spiral will turn again. For any normal person, righting the ship strategically would be child’s play. It’s a simple matter of hammering the issues that are working in Republicans’ favor this year—the economy, the porous southern border, dangerous brinkmanship in Israel and Ukraine. “Stop questioning the size of her crowds and start questioning her position when it comes to what did she do as attorney general on crime,” former Speaker Kevin McCarthy pleaded during an interview on Fox News on Monday. “Question what did she do when she was supposed to take care of the border as a czar. Question that they brought inflation, and she was the tiebreaking vote when it came to inflation, when it came to IRS agents. This is a perfect person to run against.” All it takes is an ounce of message discipline, the sort of thing replacement-level politicians learn in their first week. I suspect Trump himself would agree that’s the right approach if you put the question to him squarely. The fact that he keeps fulminating about crowds has nothing to do with him failing to appreciate the strategic logic of McCarthy’s point or even lacking the will power to stay on-message. It has to do with him being under a serious psychological disability, the same way Joe Biden was under a serious cognitive disability. Biden knew that he needed a stellar debate performance on June 27 to change the race. He knew it, and he knew the things he needed to say to make it happen. He just couldn’t do it. His mind wasn’t capable. Same here. Republicans are used to this by now, though. For nine years, a la McCarthy, the GOP establishment has been asking Donald Trump to somehow not be Donald Trump, and he’s never been able to manage it except in short spurts. (“At some point, you have [to] be truthful to yourself.”) Others, like Rep. Derrick Van Orden, have made peace with the fact that Trump is who he is and that loyalty requires them to embrace the crazy. This is the choice the party has made, repeatedly since 2016, they seem to reason. They might as well own it. If nothing else, Trump’s “AI” theory of Harris’ crowds is true to the spirit of populism. A movement that believes it’s leading a revolution by the silent majority of “real Americans” will naturally have trouble understanding how any Democrat could draw throngs of supporters during a campaign. That era was supposed to have ended with Barack Obama’s retirement; the Trump ascendancy represented a decisive turn by The People to the right, supposedly, which is why it remains so hard for so many to believe that the underwhelming Joe Biden prevailed in 2020. Maybe Harris’ huge, enthusiastic crowds will make it easier for Trump supporters to believe that she won fairly if she goes on to victory this fall, but I doubt it. Like their leader, MAGA fans have learned to understand reality as a world in which they get their way and to suspect fraud whenever those expectations are dashed. The “AI” nonsense about her crowds is an early nudge from Trump to them to judge the results in November through that lens too. If they can fake an audience, they can fake anything. A fragile man and a fragile movement.
