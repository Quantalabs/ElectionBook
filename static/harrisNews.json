Human rights groups said thousands were killed, but Trump says he’s holding off on acting after he received assurances Tehran was suspending hundreds of planned executions.\n\nLast week, Trump first announced plans to impose new tariffs on European allies that refused to go along with his calls for the U.S. to take control of the Arctic territory of Greenland — only to abruptly cancel the tariffs after saying he’d come to terms of the “framework” of an agreement. The White House offered scant details about the deal, which Trump announced the day after the stock market saw one of its worst days in months in response to his tariff threat.\n\nThen on Monday, Trump’s administration changed up oversight of his immigration operation in Minnesota, and the typically bombastic Trump offered a warmer tone toward Gov. Tim Walz after speaking with the Democrat, saying he and Walz were now on a “similar wavelength.”\n\nSome Republicans took issue with what happened in Minneapolis\n\nIt was a particularly jarring turnabout for Trump, who had promised to be uncompromising on carrying out mass deportations of undocumented migrants during his 2024 campaign — and because Trump has repeatedly scorched Walz and other Minnesota Democrats in personal terms for resisting his policies.\n\nTrump said he had dispatched border czar Tom Homan to take charge. Meanwhile, senior Border Patrol commander Greg Bovino and some agents were expected to leave Minneapolis as early as Tuesday, according to a person familiar with the matter. \n\nTrump declared on social media that Walz “was happy that Tom Homan was going to Minnesota, and so am I!” Later, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey confirmed that some agents would be leaving the city after he spoke with Trump — and suggested that the president seemed to be coming to the conclusion that the current state of federal operations was unsustainable. Homan and Frey were expected to meet Tuesday.\n\nTrump’s change-up in Minnesota came after some Republicans questioned federal agents’ tactics in Saturday’s incident as well as the White House’s response. Some high-ranking administration officials had branded Pretti a domestic terrorist even as videos of the encounter contradicted their narrative.\n\nMinnesota gubernatorial candidate Chris Madel, a Minneapolis attorney, ended his GOP campaign in a surprise video announcement Monday, calling the recent immigration enforcement operation in the Twin Cities an “unmitigated disaster” and saying he no longer wanted to be a member of the party because of it.\n\nMeanwhile, Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, who has been a strong supporter of Trump’s crackdown on immigration, offered measured criticism in an interview with conservative radio host Mark Davis, saying the White House needs to “recalibrate” what it was doing in Minnesota. Vermont’s Republican Gov. Phil Scott called on Trump to reset and de-escalate.\n\n“At best, these federal immigration operations are a complete failure of coordination of acceptable public safety and law enforcement practices training, and leadership,” Scott said. “At worst, it’s a deliberate federal intimidation and incitement of American citizens that’s resulting in the murder of Americans.”\n\nTrump had scorched Walz. Now, they’re on a ‘similar wavelength’\n\nThe president’s approach toward Walz, who served as Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris’ running mate in 2024, amounted to a sharp U-turn.\n\nJust a day earlier, Trump’s deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, had derided Walz on social media as trying to “incite attacks on” U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. The White House social media team in a series of posts called the governor “a truly disturbed, unstable individual” and an “unhinged lunatic” who “rants and raves and lies.”\n\nMiller also referred to Pretti, a nurse who worked at a Veterans Affairs hospital, as a “would-be assassin” while Homeland Security Kristi Noem labeled the ICU nurse as committing an act of domestic terrorism.\n\nThe White House sidestepped whether Trump agreed with his senior aides’ rhetoric or whether the administration would apologize for it.\n\n“This incident remains under investigation,” press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters. “And nobody here at the White House, including the president of the United States, wants to see Americans hurt or killed and losing their lives.”\n\nHis response has been muted compared to other recent deaths\n\nTrump’s response to the deaths of the two U.S. citizens protesting in Minneapolis has been much more muted than reactions to political violence that he’s portrayed as targeting his own political movement.\n\nAfter conservative activist Charlie Kirk was assassinated in September, the president spoke to the nation from the Oval Office and called Kirk’s death “a dark moment for America.” \n\nIn November, Trump gave a national address after two National Guard members were shot in Washington, D.C., by an Afghan national, one fatally. The guard members had been deployed to the nation’s capital as part of a federal mission to assist with local policing, and the president called the shooting “an act of evil, an act of hatred and an act of terror.”\n\nBut the president has yet to speak directly to the nation about the deaths in Minneapolis of Pretti and Renee Good, another protester who was killed by federal agents in Minneapolis earlier this month. Trump has so far largely chosen to keep the public informed in the wake of Pretti’s death with social media posts.\n\nEven as his comments Monday appeared to be aimed at turning down the rhetoric, Trump’s chief spokesperson, Leavitt, continued to blame Walz and other Minnesota Democrats for encouraging “left-wing agitators to stop, record, confront and obstruct federal officers who are just trying to lawfully perform their duties.”\n\n“This is precisely what unfolded in Minneapolis on Saturday morning,” Leavitt added.\n\nAP writers Josh Boak and Joey Cappelletti in Washington, Jim Vertuno in Austin, Texas, and Scott Bauer in Madison, Wisconsin, contributed reporting. Karnowski reported from Minneapolis.","url":"https://apnews.com/article/trump-pretti-minnesota-immigration-enforcement-eb9e63a625b624d2ba4ed467cb0f956c","image":"https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/3334c33/2147483647/strip/false/crop/3000x2000+0+0/resize/980x653!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F0a%2Fdc%2Fd45a3a9673b2ef6b136e98ba8aba%2F4578be493a0a4fe3a7ff61341e970dcc","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-27 01:05:41","author":"Aamer Madhani,Steve Karnowski","authors":["Aamer Madhani","Steve Karnowski"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.564},{"id":396403108,"title":"Noem in the hot seat after Minneapolis shooting","text":"Noem has butted heads previously with Homan on how to approach enforcement. Homan, who spent most of his career working as an immigration officer, has pushed to protect ICE as an institution and focus efforts on deporting unauthorized immigrants with criminal records. Noem, meanwhile, has focused on using social media to project an image of exceedingly aggressive immigration enforcement.\n\nNoem also elevated Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino to serve as the essential head of operations in Minneapolis. Leavitt told reporters Monday that Homan, not Bovino, would be the “main point of contact” going forward in Minneapolis. Bovino is also being moved out of Minneapolis, an administration official told POLITICO.\n\nDHS did not respond to a request for comment. Noem has said little since Trump distanced himself from the shooting on Sunday night, but she praised Trump’s decision to send Homan to Minneapolis in a social media post on Monday.\n\nSome in the administration were already frustrated with Noem’s reaction to the shooting of 37-year-old Nicole Good on Jan. 7, also in Minneapolis. The DHS chief seemingly rushed to respond to that incident before all the facts were known. In the days after that shooting, ICE Deputy Director Madison Sheahan, a Noem ally who ran South Dakota’s Republican Party when Noem was the state’s governor, left her post in January to run for Congress in Ohio.\n\nVoters have soured on the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in recent months. Republican polling firm Echelon Insights found in a survey of registered voters published Monday that more people now say ICE operations in public areas make them feel unsafe, a drop from their findings a few months ago when attitudes were more evenly split.\n\nMeanwhile, on Capitol Hill, Democrats have ramped up calls for Noem to resign or face impeachment proceedings over the way ICE and Border Patrol have conducted immigration enforcement operations and for allegedly mismanaging a major infusion of federal funds into the department allocated via the One Big Beautiful Bill.\n\nOther Republican lawmakers, while not naming Noem, have called on the agency leaders that report to her to testify. Some, such as House Homeland Security Chair Andrew Garbarino (R-N.Y.), represent states or congressional districts where Trump only narrowly defeated former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 elections.\n\nDespite the growing pressure on Noem, Krikorian argued she’s unlikely to be ousted.\n\n“It would be a win for the anti-border radicals” and “embolden” efforts to resist ICE operations elsewhere, Krikorian said.\n\nDasha Burns and Myah Ward contributed to this report.","url":"https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/26/kristi-noem-scrutiny-minneapolis-shootings-00748618","image":"https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/405d400/2147483647/resize/1200x/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F5f%2F7b%2Fbd61db324286bd4eeac3e78ff01a%2Fmain-bazail-eimil-noemblame-illustration.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-27 01:02:00","author":"Eric Bazail-Eimil","authors":["Eric Bazail-Eimil"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.108},{"id":396405072,"title":"Washington Post Braces for Massive Layoffs","text":"Last week there were reports that a big round of layoffs was about to be unveiled at the Washington Post. Some stores suggested the entire Sports staff was going to be removed.\n\nStaffers at The Post are questioning Bezos and publisher Will Lewis’ commitment to the health of the paper—and publicly pleading for them to change course—as they brace for upwards of 100 newsroom layoffs that are expected to hit the sports, metro and foreign teams hardest, according to multiple people familiar with the matter. As of August, the newsroom headcount sat around 800 staffers. Including those anticipated newsroom cuts, as many as 300 Post employees across the broader company could be impacted by the February trim-down, Status has learned.Spokespersons for The Post did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this story.“The newsroom is being punished for absolute incompetence from the owner and publisher,” one Post staffer said.\n\nThe report goes on to say that the Post would not be sending a team of reporters to cover the Winter Olympics despite having already paid for their travel and lodging. But a new story from the NY Times says the Post is reversing course on that decision though it will only be sending a handful of reporters.\n\nThe newspaper originally intended to send more than a dozen journalists to cover the event, which has long been a major priority for The Post. Those employees were notified in a terse email on Friday, less than three weeks before the Olympics begin, that The Post would not send any of them.Now, The Post expects to send four journalists, according to three people with knowledge of the decision. A spokeswoman for The Post confirmed the paper would be sending a small contingent.\n\nAlso worried about the cuts are the paper's foreign correspondents. The have sent a collective letter to Jeff Bezos asking him to, essentially, keep pouring money into the paper. Erik Wemple tweeted out the letter yesterday:\n\nIt says that The Post’s “award-winning international team regularly scoops and outshines the New York Times, Wall Street Journal and other major news outlets, despite already having significantly fewer reporters.”— ErikWemple (@ErikWemple) January 25, 2026\n\nThe letter says that the staffers are committed to cutting costs while working to retain “as many jobs as we can.” It also mentions the key role of local staff overseas, whose “language skills and experience amplify the power of our journalism.”— ErikWemple (@ErikWemple) January 25, 2026\n\nThere are scores of signatories, and they include senior correspondents such as Greg Miller, Anthony Faiola, Souad Mekhennet, Siobhán O’Grady, Shibani Mahtani and Yeganeh Torbati. Together they cover an astounding swath of global terrain.— ErikWemple (@ErikWemple) January 25, 2026\n\nIndividual reporters are also appealing to Bezos using the hashtag #SaveThePost:\n\nHi @JeffBezos.

Saving a newspaper would be cheap by comparison. But now the @washingtonpost's brave foreign correspondents must launch a #SaveThePost campaign, amid rumored devastating cuts that amount to a mere rounding error to Bezos. https://t.co/XyHAuJ2Mwl— Katherine Eban (@KatherineEban) January 26, 2026\n\nIn fact, $50 million would not begin to save the Post. Bezos has spent more than that each year keeping it afloat. In 2023 the paper lost about $77million. In 2024, it reportedly lost $100 million.\n\nThe Washington Post lost around $100 million in 2024 as top journalists defected to the publication’s competitors, the Wall Street Journal reported Friday.That figure is reportedly approximately 30% greater than The Post’s losses in 2023. Advertising revenue at the publication also fell from $190 million to $174 million, WSJ wrote.These losses are reportedly compounded by The Post also losing a significant number of digital subscribers. At least 250,000 people canceled their subscriptions after The Post chose not to issue an endorsement in the 2024 presidential election, breaking a longstanding pattern, the paper reported in October.\n\nWhat were the losses in 2025? We don't know but probably similar to 2024. In other words, Bezos has probably spent more than a quarter billion dollars keeping the paper going for just 3 years. And my guess is that all the metrics are going in the wrong direction. In other words, there's no end in sight to the losses. But the staff reaction to his attempt to stop the bleeding is that he's not a good steward.\n\nA top Post reporter tells me \"there's now a strong sense\" across the newsroom \"that neither Jeff Bezos nor Will Lewis are serious, good-faith stewards of The Washington Post.\" pic.twitter.com/ORtFdFmWbD— Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) January 26, 2026\n\nThanks for the $300 million, Jeff, but you suck!\n\nSome of this is definitely self-inflicted. The paper was making a profit during Trump's first term because it went all in on resistance journalism. It had a staff of progressive voices that became well known on the anti-Trump left. So when there was no Trump to bash starting in 2020, readership declined. Then when Bezos demanded a bit more neutrality from the paper (canceling an endorsement of Kamala Harris) a quarter millions progressive subscribers cut them off. Simply put, the Post made itself a paper that catered to the far left and readers came to expect that. There's no going back without angering a lot of those people and losing their support. That's where things are now.\n\nThe layoffs are expected to happen in early February, so expect more on this by next week.\n\nEditor’s Note: Do you enjoy Hot Air's conservative reporting that takes on the radical left and woke media?

We are seeing the \"fine people\" hoax, the Jussie Smollett hoax, and the Covington Kids hoax repeated a thousand times. And no matter how many times these hoaxes are debunked, the next one generates the same outrage in the usual suspects because they are primed to believe the worst of anybody they dislike. \n\nThe \"bait boy\" story followed an all-too-familiar pattern. Even after it was debunked, Gov. Tim Walz was still raising it late last week to paint ICE as soulless, depraved thugs. It is all part of our post-truth political environment. https://t.co/nh8oyi2c1D— Jonathan Turley (@JonathanTurley) January 26, 2026\n\nOne of the most recent and notorious of the hoaxes is the so-called \"bait boy\" hoax. By now you know the story: ICE detained a 5-year-old boy to use as bait to force his father to turn himself in. It is a story designed to inflame your emotions, confirm that Trump's Gestapo is just one step away from gassing the illegal immigrants, and prime you to believe that tales of ICE or Border Patrol agents casually assassinating people in the streets. \n\nBREAKING - ABC is now facing a potential defamation lawsuit after David Muir went on air last night and spread the lie to millions that ICE agents used a child as bait to capture his father when in reality the father abandoned his child.Every agent involved needs to sue. pic.twitter.com/AQiUtb0ktB— Right Angle News Network (@Rightanglenews) January 23, 2026\n\nThe Bait Boy story is a classic case of what I am dubbing Minnewood, the successor to Pallywood, even though the same tactics are being used throughout the country. Minneapolis is ground zero, and in a city that envies more famous ones (when I moved here, they sold mugs calling it the \"Minne-apple\"), it makes sense to give them a comparison to Hollywood. \n\nBelow is my column in The Hill on the false “bait boy” story that went viral last week, the latest concoction of the left and an enabling media. It was an all-too-familiar pattern. Even after it was debunked, Gov. Tim Walz was still raising it late last week to paint ICE as soulless, depraved thugs. It simply does not matter that it is untrue in our post-truth political environment.Here is the opinion:“I am outraged, and you should be too.” That message from former Vice President Kamala Harris has been a virtual mantra of the Democratic Party for years. For several months, this has meant decrying the imminent death of democracy and our descent into authoritarianism. Now, it means falsely claiming that ICE “kidnapped” or “arrested” a five-year-old boy and used him as “bait” to catch someone.The “bait boy” story is actually the latest clickbait hoax in our “Age of Rage.”Five years ago, Harris was expressing the same call for outrage over the false story of Border agents whipping migrants in Texas. She expressed disgust over the “horrible and deeply troubling” scenes reminiscent of the slave period.It quickly became a pile-on, with the media spreading the false account. Reps. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) and Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) described the incident as “worse than what we witnessed in slavery” and “white supremacist behavior.”President Biden threw the agents under the bus, publicly expressing disgust over their conduct and promising punishment before any investigation had occurred: “It was horrible what to see, as you saw — to see people treated like they did: horses nearly running them over and people being strapped. It’s outrageous. I promise you, those people will pay.”The media continued to repeat the false account, even as many of us pointed out that the publicly available video showed the story was demonstrably untrue. It did not matter. It fit the narrative on the left, and the agents were left under investigation for more than a year before being cleared of the “whipping” charges.After the false story was exposed, the media just shrugged and went on to the next gotcha story.\n\nThe casualness with which lies are told is only possible with the complicity of the media. You probably recall the media frenzy surrounding the Covington Kids or Jussiee Smollett, but you may not recall how many days and weeks were spent pounding the false version of those stories. We are occasionally referring to the \"fine people\" hoax because it stuck. \n\nAs for this new hoax, Rep. Angie Craig (D-Minn.) declared the incident to be “the worst of the damn worst” in a video on X. Craig, a candidate for Senate, accused federal officers of taking the boy to “use him to lure his father out.”That is false. According to reports, the father was spotted in public and fled, abandoning the boy. Like Harris, Craig reminded citizens that “this is a time where we should all be outraged. If this doesn’t pierce through your humanity, as a Republican member of Congress, if you can’t speak out about this, then you’ve got no humanity left.”The key, again, is the requisite outrage. If you are not outraged, you are not human.\n\nBig lies work. \n\nAnother legacy media conspiracy: @washingtonpost alleges ICE used a 5-year-old kid as “bait” to arrest his father.Not until five paragraphs into the piece do they acknowledge what really happened: the child’s father, an illegal immigrant, abandoned him when he saw ICE. pic.twitter.com/VkMnOLm4Ud— Drew Holden (@DrewHolden360) January 22, 2026\n\nThe irony of the \"Bait Boy\" story is that it was his FATHER who abandoned HIM, knowing full well that ICE would take care of him. Suburban moms are more afraid of ICE than actual illegal aliens because they know better. \n\nIn this case, ICE officers were trying to detain Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias, an undocumented Ecuadorian national, when he bolted and left behind his five-year-old child, Liam Conejo Ramos.Rather than leave the child in the freezing cold on the street, the officers took the child to his home to get his mother to take him in. She refused to open the door despite agents reportedly saying that she would not be detained. They proceeded to take the boy to McDonald’s, play his favorite music, and take care of him. He was never arrested. They also did not send him into detention. According to ICE, his father asked for the boy to be allowed to stay with him at a detention facility, and ICE agreed.\n\nBut none of that matters in the propaganda war. Repeat \"Gestapo\" enough, and the outrage meter is pegged. People see what they want to see, and they want to be angry at Bad Orange Man and MAGA. Defund the Police has turned into Defund ICE, and the Democrats are talking about shutting down the government to defund ICE. \n\nProbably one of the most insane sentences ever published in the @nytimes.And that's saying something. pic.twitter.com/iYZzU2oGUT— Yehuda Teitelbaum (@chalavyishmael) January 25, 2026\n\nAna Navarro lies and says government doesn’t lie except this one.Give us a break.She then regurgitates the hoax about the 5-year-old who was actually abandoned by her dad (an illegal) but who she says ICE detained to use as bait.Navarro always lies.pic.twitter.com/GHkeTyt9at— Paul A.

This was never about the children. It was all about Democrats manipulating their voters' emotions with fake narratives.\n\nThe Biden administration released illegal alien Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias into the United States, and this month ICE tried to arrest him. Conejo Arias then abandoned his five-year-old son in a futile attempt to evade arrest. ICE officers stayed with the child, vainly tried to convince the mother to take him, took him to a McDonald's, and played his favorite music. In other words, the despicable parents were at fault while ICE went above and beyond to help the boy. But Democrats, including Kamala Harris, aggressively insisted that ICE heartlessly arrested the child, snatching him from the bosom of his loving family.\n\nWhile Democrats continue to wail and gnash their teeth over Conejo Arias's child, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is seeking custody of Hernando Garcia-Morales, a Mexican criminal illegal alien who fractured an eight-year-old's skull. The DHS press release explained:\n\nAccording to local reports, on January 7, the school bus was traveling on the New Jersey Turnpike to Yeshivat Noam, a local Jewish day school, returning from a field trip at Liberty Science Center. This is when Garcia-Morales threw a rock at the vehicle, breaking a window and hitting the third-grade student. The young girl was forced to have surgery.Two days later, on January 9, New Jersey Turnpike State Police arrested Garcia-Morales for Aggravated Assault, Resisting Arrest, and Possession of Weapon. The Bogota Police Department also charged him for Aggravated Assault, Criminal Trespassing-Defiant, Criminal Trespassing Peering, and Criminal Mischief-Damage Property.\n\nSo where's the Democrat hysteria?

They can get no political capital out of that story, so they won't discuss it.\n\nRelated: Someone Is Obviously Bankrolling the Minneapolis Protests\n\nThis is why Donald Trump absolutely cannot trust Democrats like Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz when they make promises of reform, and why Trump should most certainly not make any concessions to Walz and co. or withdraw federal officers to appease them. The Democrat governors like Walz and Gavin Newsom have spent years proudly violating federal immigration laws and spreading lies to rile up rioters. Yesterday Walz compared ICE arrests in Minneapolis to the Nazi Holocaust, but today he and Trump chatted on the phone, and suddenly Trump is willing to overlook the years of illegal behavior and send away some Border Patrol, as if Border Patrol were the problem. And so our brave immigration officers under constant assault from mobs of Minneapolis rioters will have no backup, no Insurrection Act to assist them.\n\nDoes Trump honestly think he can make a deal with the devil? Republicans have been trying that tactic with Democrats since the 19th century and it has failed spectacularly every single time. You cannot trust people who lie for a living and see no issue with breaking laws and committing senseless violence.","url":"https://pjmedia.com/catherinesalgado/2026/01/26/lefties-screeched-about-illegal-alien-5-yr-old-but-not-us-8-yr-old-injured-by-illegal-alien-n4948775","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2026/26/4befe915-daf8-455c-8865-8d7b403b5582.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-27 00:15:22","author":"Catherine Salgado","authors":["Catherine Salgado"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.447},{"id":396393854,"title":"Martha Stewart Breaks Political Silence: ‘Things Must Change’","text":"Martha Stewart is “speaking up” about ICE.\n\nAnd the original homemaking influencer said her 14-year-old granddaughter, Jude, inspired her to do so in a new Instagram post. \n\n“I am disheartened and sad each and every day that we cannot demonstrate our sympathy for the beleaguered, that we are told immigrants, which most of us are or descended from, are unwelcome,” Stewart wrote in text inserted over the exchange. \n\n“That we cannot show our frustration in peaceful demonstrations, and that we can be attacked and even killed by Federal troops.

Given Clark’s turbulent year in the media, we were curious how Le Batard would approach the discussion. Admittedly, we expected him to ask Clark about his many blunders, errors, and public outbursts, then let Clark explain himself without any real pushback. That did not happen. Instead, Le Batard defended Clark and told him none of the controversies surrounding him were his fault. \"The race wars are unpleasant, and you get in the middle of them by virtue of having honest opinions and protecting the disenfranchised,\" Le Batard said. \"So you end up in fights that are not fought in good faith.\" Le Batard went further, portraying Clark as isolated and unfairly targeted. \"I have reached out to you a couple of times when this happens to you, when I feel like you are alone in the world, like you are fighting alone at ESPN or in the landscape,\" he said. \"There have been a number of times where things have happened with you where I think you might feel alone, like everything around you does not feel honest or fair.\" Clark thanked Le Batard and said he would never \"stop speaking about things that matter\" to him. \"When people attack you from a point of misunderstanding, it’s difficult for me to stomach,\" Clark added. Le Batard is right about one thing. The race wars are unpleasant. What is not true, however, is that Clark only finds himself in the middle of them because he is selflessly \"protecting the disenfranchised.\" Clark appears in these discussions because he repeatedly inserts himself into them and often sparks them. In June, Clark shamed Robert Griffin III for marrying a white woman and suggested that fact disqualified Griffin from speaking about Black women. That controversy began during a debate involving Angel Reese and Caitlin Clark. Ryan Clark turned that conversation into a racial confrontation. No bad-faith actors forced the outcome. Clark later admitted he was wrong and apologized. \"She should not have been brought up in me trying to make a point about how having black women close to you and the things that you can learn from them can help you approach how you speak to, and about them,\" Clark said of Griffin’s wife, Grete Griffin, who is white. \"She didn’t need to be the illustration of that. I could speak positively about what they are without making the insinuations that it’s something that non-black women don’t do well.\" Clark also apologized for claiming during an impromptu Monday Night Football segment that Louisiana police fabricated evidence against Kyren Lacy, a black former LSU wide receiver. Lacy later died by suicide. Between those apologies, Clark issued another for a \"regrettable\" on-air and off-air moment in which he belittled colleague Peter Schrager for never playing in the NFL. Clark has shown no similar disdain for Mina Kimes or Stephen A. Smith, neither of whom played professionally. One wonders why. You might also wonder why Clark claims the media protects Josh Allen while unfairly criticizing Lamar Jackson, when his own commentary reflects the opposite. According to Clark, Allen has \"no excuses\" for failing to reach a Super Bowl, while Jackson deserves a pass because football is a team sport. Clark’s first notable entry into the culture war likely came in 2021, when he refused to appear on \"SportsCenter\" with Sage Steele over a comment she made about Barack Obama. Steele, a bi-racial woman, questioned why Obama, a bi-racial man, identifies as black with a white mom and black father. Ryan Clark admitted this was the reason why he told management he would not go on set with Steele. So the question remains. How are bad-faith actors supposedly distorting Clark’s words for cultural war purposes while he simply \"protects the disenfranchised\"? OutKick posed that question to Dan Le Batard via text message on Monday. As of publication, he has not responded. We will update this story if he does. We do not expect a reply. Le Batard knows he cannot credibly defend his defense of Clark. For one, Clark has admitted to and apologized for most of the controversies. Secondly, Le Batard’s own role in the culture war explains why he rushed to Clark’s defense. Consider Le Batard’s recent record. He defended Deadspin after it framed a nine-year-old child as wearing blackface by publishing a deliberately deceptive photo that showed only one side of the child’s face. He labeled fans of Donald Trump and Dave Portnoy as anti-Semitic. He accused OutKick of sexist coverage of Mina Kimes for accurately quoting her own words. Le Batard frequently condemns the NFL, UFC, and the Baltimore Ravens for failing to \"respect women\" who accuse men of violence. Yet he employed Howard Bryant, who was arrested for allegedly beating and choking his wife in public. In October, Le Batard landed the first interview with Doug Emhoff, Kamala Harris’ husband, after a Daily Mail report alleged Emhoff forcefully slapped a former girlfriend in 2012. And yet, Le Batard never asked Emhoff about the allegation. Not once. Instead, he asked what \"loving Kamala\" felt like. So much for \"respecting women.\" We admit, Le Batard and Clark are good for each other. They are both clout-chasing race idolaters who cry foul whenever they overreach or expose their own hypocrisy, which happens a lot. If there were ever two people who should \"stick to sports\" for their own sakes, it’s those two.","summary":"Dan Le Batard tells Ryan Clark that he is a victim of the &quot;Race Wars.&quot;","url":"https://www.outkick.com/analysis/dan-le-batard-tells-ryan-clark-hes-victim-race-wars","image":"https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2026/01/lebatard-clark-1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-26 22:20:13","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.257},{"id":396376672,"title":"Trump moves the goal posts on Alex Pretti killing. Has the public’s ICE anger finally hit home at the White House?","text":"Just over a year into President Donald Trump’s second term, it appears the White House has finally discovered a level of public anger that can’t be waved away or powered through by flooding the zone with red meat for his political base.\n\nDays after Border Patrol agents fired as many as ten bullets into 37-year-old Minneapolis nurse Alex Pretti in what was the second killing of an American in Minnesota by federal law enforcement since the start of this year, Trump announced on Truth Social that he was sending his “Border Czar,” Tom Homan, to the city so he could take charge of the sprawling immigration enforcement effort that has terrorized the city’s communities of color. The push has also sparked fierce resistance from residents and left Governor Tim Walz and Mayor Jacob Frey decrying it as a hostile “invasion” or “occupation” of the North Star State’s largest city. \n\nTrump described Homan as “tough but fair” and said the former Immigration and Customs Enforcement director would report “directly” to him. \n\nThree hours later, the president posted another message describing a “very good call” he’d had with Walz where he promised the governor that he’d have Homan get in touch with him and said the federal government’s request for cooperation from Minnesota law enforcement was to provide “any and all criminals that they have in their possession” — something Walz says the state has been doing for years by notifying ICE when someone here illegally is finishing a jail or prison sentence. \n\nIt was a stunning reversal for Trump and his administration, which for the last month has been happy to have roving patrols of ICE and Border Patrol officers and agents running rampant through the Twin cities, snatching people out of cars and using children as bait to arrest parents, all the while happily throwing flash-bangs and using tear gas against any protesters who they viewed as getting in their way. \n\nThe brutal approach to enforcement that had been on display in Minnesota was the work of Stephen Miller, Trump’s deputy chief of staff, along with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who had for months worked to sideline Homan, whose no-nonsense, workmanlike approach to immigration enforcement has always centered on arresting and deporting criminals, preferably by taking them into custody when they are under arrest by state or local governments or upon their release from state prisons. \n\nMiller, Noem and her close aide and political adviser, Corey Lewandowski, had managed to push Homan’s approach side by elevating Greg Bovino, a mid-level Border Patrol commander known for his harsh tactics and disdain for the press and protesters (and for his allegedly Nazi-esque fashion sense) while reportedly attempting to force the Senate-confirmed head of Customs and Border Protection, Rodney Scott, to resign or retire by making his job so miserable that he’d walk and leave his position open to be filled by Bovino on an acting basis. \n\nTheir success at navigating the internal tensions at the White House and DHS, which were first reported on by the Washington Examiner, led Noem and her allies to conclude that Trump would be willing to tolerate an almost unlimited level of brutality so long as it was directed at the right people — illegal immigrants and liberal protesters — in service of Trump’s promise to implement a mass deportation campaign.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt tried to justify the more brutal approach during her Monday briefing by claiming that Trump was “fulfilling the will of the people” who voted for him in 2024 by “arresting and removing ... threats from our country” and cited a number of oft-repeated cases in which Americans had been killed by people who hadn’t been in the country legally. \n\nShe pressed the idea that Trump is arresting criminals and that is what the American public wants. But that is not what is happening in American streets. Recent reports suggest over half of the people in ICE custody have not been convicted of a crime.\n\nLeavitt also claimed that the move to dispatch Homan was in part driven by Noem’s broader responsibilities, including oversight of the Federal Emergency Management Agency — which she has tried to gut — during last weekend’s winter storm. \n\nBy and large, Leavitt is correct that Americans want to see stronger border enforcement — and that's something Trump has delivered on by harsh measures at the U.S.-Mexico border which have cut down illegal crossings by significant amounts.\n\nYet at the same time, Americans have soured on the thuggish tactics exhibited by federal forces in Minnesota, even as Leavitt attempted to blame the violence of recent weeks on “Democrat leaders” whose “sanctuary city policies have actively defied federal immigration law and the will of the people.”\n\nAfter Americans across the country watched the videotaped shooting of Pretti and subsequent attempts by Miller, Noem and Bovino to smear him by falsely accusing him of attacking Border Patrol officers and blaming his legally-carried firearm for his death, it appears Trump, who remains far more sensitive to polling than he would prefer to admit, has found a limit. \n\nWith a growing number of Republicans in Congress calling for an investigation into the killing, the president has to find a way to save face while not appearing to back down to a Democratic protest movement or give an inch to the governor, who was Kamala Harris’ running-mate during the 2024 election. \n\nBy putting Homan, a career Border Patrol agent who knows and understands how Immigrations and Customs Enforcement conducts targeted operations without antagonizing the public or shooting protesters, back in charge, Trump is able to de-escalate without really de-escalating in the eyes of his base.\n\nAfter all, Homan is no liberal or shrinking violet on immigration matters. He was an architect of the Project 2025 immigration section which called for a mass deportation operation and the end to birthright citizenship. \n\nBy moving the goalposts from allowing wholesale roundups by Border Patrol to targeted enforcement at jails and prisons, Trump is giving himself an off-ramp that will let him avoid continued public anger while not getting crosswise with his base.","summary":"ANALYSIS: Trump’s dispatching of Tom Homan to Minneapolis lets him keep his base happy while avoiding more of the violence that has stoked massive public anger in recent days, Andrew Feinberg writes","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-alex-pretti-shooting-analysis-b2908026.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2026/01/26/18/36/GettyImages-2216969214.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/3YPDHpDz-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2026-01-26 21:56:29","author":"Andrew Feinberg","authors":["Andrew Feinberg"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.369},{"id":396373960,"title":"Inside an Anxious Washington Post, With Eyes on Jeff Bezos | Analysis","text":"As the Washington Post newsroom braces for layoffs, journalists took their case public on Monday, turning to social media to urge mega-billionaire owner Jeff Bezos to support the paper’s robust and storied foreign coverage. \n\n“Hi @JeffBezos,” Ukraine bureau chief Siobhán O’Grady wrote on X. “We will never forget your support for our essential work documenting the war in Ukraine, which still rages. Your wife has called our team ‘badass beacons of hope.’ We risk our lives for the stories our readers demand. Please believe in us and #SaveThePost.”\n\nCorrespondent Yeganeh Torbati, who covers Iran for the paper, also tweeted directly to Bezos, saying she wants “nothing more than to keep doing this important work,” while White House bureau chief Matt Viser wrote that “it’s impossible to overstate how much we rely upon” the international desk and “how diminished we’d be without them.”\n\nThe public appeals on Monday speak to fears inside the paper that significant cuts are on the horizon — particularly in international coverage — and reflect growing doubts about whether Bezos, the Amazon founder reportedly worth around $250 billion, remains fully invested in supporting the paper. The Post, which reportedly lost around $100 million in 2024, went through a painful round of buyouts last year, and staffers worry that further cuts at the start of 2026 could deepen the turmoil at a time when rigorous coverage of global conflict and crisis feels more essential than ever.\n\n[Layoffs will] reaffirm a widely held belief on staff that Jeff Bezos and Will Lewis are not serious caretakers of The Washington Post.” \n\nIn conversations with TheWrap, staffers expressed frustration with Bezos’ seeming distance from the paper, as well as with CEO and publisher Will Lewis, whose widely touted “third newsroom” initiative never gained traction amid broader upheaval during his two-year tenure. They also fault management for the loss of hundreds of thousands of subscribers after the paper spiked a 2024 endorsement of Kamala Harris. “If their answer to those losses is to take it out on staff now, what are we doing?” asked a staffer. \n\n“The lack of communication has left folks twisting in the wind,” another staffer told TheWrap, adding that “many people aren’t sure if they’ll have jobs next week.”\n\nThe Post’s precarious state contrasts sharply from a decade ago, when it was among the standout publications during Donald Trump’s first term, with the paper, under then-executive editor Marty Baron, landing major scoops and adopting the motto “Democracy Dies in Darkness.” Even as the Post continues to deliver dogged coverage of Trump’s second administration, Bezos’ cozier relationship with the president and his remaking of the opinion section around “personal liberties and free markets” have raised concerns about whether he remains as committed to holding the administration accountable.\n\nIt wasn’t lost on staffers that Bezos didn’t publicly comment on the FBI’s search of a Post reporter’s home earlier this month, even as he found time to tweet about Polymarket. At the same time, Amazon MGM Studios reportedly paid $40 million for the licensing rights to a new Melania Trump documentary — which was screened Saturday night at the White House — while Amazon is among the corporate donors to Trump’s ballroom project. \n\nForeign correspondents pleaded with Bezos over the weekend, urging him in a letter to “preserve our newspaper’s global coverage.” They reminded Bezos how he told staff, upon buying the paper in 2013, that being “profitable and shrinking” is “a survival strategy, but it ultimately leads to irrelevance, at best. And at worst, it leads to extinction.”\n\nA third staffer told TheWrap, “If Bezos cares a little bit about this newspaper, and wants this paper to get back to the golden days under the leadership of Marty Baron, then he needs to make changes at the top.”\n\nForeign reporting has long been one of the Post’s hallmarks, stretching back to Pulitzer Prize-winning work by the likes of David Remnick and the late Anthony Shadid, and extending to more recent coverage of ISIS, the Israel-Hamas war, Ukraine, Iran and Venezuela. That legacy is now colliding with deep uncertainty inside the newsroom, where rumors swirl that not only foreign coverage, but sports and metro desk teams are on the chopping block.\n\nPotential layoffs on the international desk are particularly unnerving, not only because of the Post’s legacy, but because some foreign journalists rely on the paper for U.S. visas — or to continue reporting from the countries they cover.\n\nForeign correspondents have been told not to travel to crisis zones after Feb. 1, which fueled speculation that management wants U.S.-based staff at home ahead of potential layoffs next month.\n\nOn Friday, the Post also abruptly canceled plans to send a contingent to cover the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Games, which kick off on Feb. 6. Though the specter of layoffs has loomed for some time, “cutting Olympics coverage at the last minute did shock a lot of staff,” the second staffer told TheWrap. “It all feels more serious and urgent now.”\n\nTheWrap learned Monday that the Post now plans to send four journalists to the games, as opposed to the more than a dozen originally expected. A Post spokesperson confirmed the Olympics plan. \n\n“Perhaps the cuts aren’t as bad as rumored,” added the second staffer. “But if they are, it’ll reaffirm a widely held belief on staff that Jeff Bezos and Will Lewis are not serious caretakers of The Washington Post.” \n\nTurning out the lights on ambitious, hard-hitting international coverage would give a stark new meaning to the Post’s long-standing warning that “Democracy Dies in Darkness.”\n\nCorbin Bolies contributed reporting for this story.","summary":"Rumors of cuts to the international, metro and sports desks are leaving journalists “twisting in the wind” and prompting unusually public appeals to ownership\n\n\nThe post Inside an Anxious Washington Post, With Eyes on Jeff Bezos | Analysis appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/media-platforms/journalism/washington-post-layoffs-jeff-bezos/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/bezos-pic.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-26 21:48:32","author":"Countless Washington Post,Michael Calderone","authors":["Countless Washington Post","Michael Calderone"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.232},{"id":396380140,"title":"Dem Insider Has Brutal Prediction for Newsom 2028’s Odds","text":"Gavin Newsom’s not-so-subtle moves to secure a spot on the 2028 presidential ticket aren’t sitting well with the Democratic Party’s whisperer.\n\nDavid Axelrod, the veteran strategist behind Barack Obama’s campaigns and a longtime voice of the left’s private musings, is taking aim at what he sees as the California governor’s performative efforts to position himself for the top spot.\n\nThe California Democrat, 58, has effectively appointed himself Donald Trump’s troller-in-chief since the president returned to office, frequently needling Trump online and, at times, attempting to steal his spotlight in person.\n\nJust last week, Newsom appeared alongside Trump at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where he urged allies to “stand united” against the president, 79. Newsom later watched as Trump addressed political and business leaders before dismissing the speech as “boring, and at times boorish.”\n\n“Part of my approach has been a little more aggressive than perhaps a lot of American politicians,” Newsom said Thursday in an interview with Semafor.\n\nBut while Newsom has succeeded in provoking the Trump administration and capturing Democrats’ attention, Axelrod has repeatedly questioned whether the governor can earn the broader electorate’s trust.\n\nI​​n an interview with Axios, Axelrod acknowledged that Newsom is “enormously talented” but cautioned that “Authenticity is an essential quality in any presidential candidate.

The teams ultimately took to the court 24 hours later in a somber matchup. \n\nKerr addressed the political climate following his team's 111-85 victory as he appeared to blame the media for the divides in the nation. \n\nGolden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr spoke out on the latest fatal ICE shooting\n\nAlex Jeffrey Pretti was gunned down during a struggle with federal agents in Minneapolis\n\n'My concern as an American, we're not perfect,' he said when asked about a 'path forward' in the US. \n\n'We've never been perfect. But I think our ideals have been in the right place for a long time, our values. And I think no matter what side of the aisle you stand on, I think remembering the values that come with the constitution, that come with citizenship, the values of looking after each other are so important right now, just because of the extremism that we can feel from all over the place. People are so angry.\n\n'There should be an appeal to our better angels to look after one another and to recognize what's happening. We're being divided by media for profit, by misinformation. There's so much out there that is really difficult for all of us to reconcile. In times like these, you have to lean on values and who you are and who you want to be — either as an individual or as a country. And I think that's the biggest thing.\n\n'And that's what's so sad about all of this. It's like we're at each other's throats right now. And you can't just say, 'I'm right, the other person's wrong.' Not within this current climate of nonstop news flooding at us. 'News.' It's hard to decipher what's real and what's not. What's true and what's not true. People arguing over the exact same video, saying, 'This happened. No that happened.' It is a confusing time to be alive and to be an American. So, what I would appeal to everyone is to remember what our constitution stands for, what our values are, and what that means to how we treat each other and our fellow citizens.'\n\nKerr has long been an outspoken critic of Trump and he delivered a brutal speech in support of Kamala Harris at the 2024 Democratic National Convention. \n\nThe coach, who said the game was one of the 'most bizarre and sad' that he had been a part of, hailed the people of Minneapolis amid the current tension.\n\n'I've been following everything. It's very sad,' Kerr said. 'This has always been a great stop on the NBA tour. I love the city of Minneapolis. The people here are wonderful and it's very sad what's happening. I feel for the city. There's a pall that's been cast over the city. You can feel it. A lot of people are suffering.\n\n'Obviously, loss of life is the No. 1 concern. Those families will never get their family members back. When all the unrest settles down, whenever that is, those family members won't be returning home and that's devastating.'\n\nThe Warriors' game against the Minnesota Timberwolves was originally postponed \n\nKerr greets Minnesota Timberwolves head coach Chris Finch (right) after Sunday's game \n\nFans hold signs to protest the presence of federal agents in Minneapolis during the game \n\nKerr also said that he had discussed the postponement of the game in depth with Timberwolves head coach Chris Finch and that he supported the decision. \n\n'General feeling is just one of sadness for Minneapolis, for the city. It had been through a lot,' Kerr continued. 'We empathize with the citizens here, with the Wolves franchise and their fans. It's a wonderful place. As I've said, I've always felt a great vibe here. The expression 'Minnesota nice' is a real thing. People here really, really care about each other. Take care of their neighbors and go out of their way to help one another.\n\n'It's a beautiful city and it's just tough to see everybody really going through a lot of angst and anger and sadness and grief.'\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said Pretti was shot after he 'approached' Border Patrol officers with a 9mm semiautomatic handgun.\n\nDHS Secretary Kristi Noem claimed that officers 'clearly feared for their lives' and fired defensive shots at Pretti after he 'violently' resisted federal agents.\n\nFederal authorities claimed the intensive care unit nurse was carrying a loaded Sig Sauer P320 9mm pistol, but video captured at the scene appears to show officers disarming him before shots rang out.\n\nMinneapolis police say Pretti had no serious criminal history and was a lawful gun owner with a valid permit, while his family eviscerated the Trump administration in a blistering statement.\n\n'The sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting,' they said.\n\nVideo shows agents wrestling with Pretti and taking him to the ground before he was shot\n\n'Alex is clearly not holding a gun when attacked by Trump's murdering and cowardly ICE thugs. He has his phone in his right hand and his empty left hand is raised above his head while trying to protect the woman ICE just pushed down all while being pepper sprayed. \n\n'Please get the truth out about our son. He was a good man.'\n\nOn Sunday, the NBPA released a statement urging Americans not to let 'the flames of division' threaten their 'civil liberties.'\n\n'Following the news of yet another fatal shooting in Minneapolis, a city that has been on the forefront of the fight against injustices, NBA players can no longer remain silent,' it read.\n\n'Now more than ever, we must defend the right to freedom of speech and stand in solidarity with the people in Minnesota protesting and risking their lives to demand justice.\n\n'The fraternity of NBA players, like the United States itself, is a community enriched by its global citizens, and we refuse to let the flames of division threaten the civil liberties that are meant to protect us all.'\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nLong-standing Trump critic Steve Kerr gives grim verdict about 'divided' America's future in impassioned speech\n\nAdd comment","summary":"Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care nurse, was shot and killed after a struggle with federal agents on Saturday after he allegedly confronted officers during a DHS operation in Minneapolis.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/nba/article-15497359/steve-kerr-trump-america-divide-minneapolis.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2026/01/26/21/105845019-0-image-m-17_1769461267492.jpg","video":"https://video.dailymail.com/video/mol/2026/01/26/7587189528565334472/1024x576_MP4_7587189528565334472.mp4","publish_date":"2026-01-26 21:19:41","author":"Editor,Isabel Baldwin","authors":["Editor","Isabel Baldwin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"jp","sentiment":-0.295},{"id":396361738,"title":"Washington Post staffers plead with billionaire owner Jeff Bezos to save the paper amid major looming layoffs","text":"Washington Post staffers have resorted to directly addressing billionaire owner Jeff Bezos with a tense letter and \"#SaveThePost\" messages on social media amid reports of significant layoffs on the horizon. The last several years at the Washington Post have been turbulent between significant financial losses, the exodus of talent that has fled to competing outlets and low morale in the newsroom. Washington Post leaders have been working for roughly two years to be in a position to break even financially after reported $100 million losses in 2024, and an upcoming headcount reduction is expected to help accomplish that goal. Former media writer Paul Farhi, who left in 2023 after 35 years at the paper and remains close to the newsroom, told Fox News Digital that staffers are currently hearing as many as 300 people company-wide —many of them sports and foreign affairs reporters, but also non-newsroom personnel — could be laid off. Staffers have been kept in the dark as rumors swirled over the weekend after a series of reports caused panic at the paper, prompting the paper’s foreign correspondents to send a letter directly to Bezos. EDITORIAL OVERHAUL: WASHINGTON POST'S NEW OPINION CHIEF FEELS THE WEIGHT OF THE CHALLENGES AHEAD \"We are The Washington Post’s international correspondents, writing with a collective plea for you to preserve our newspaper’s global coverage, which we fear will be greatly weakened in coming cuts,\" they wrote in a memo first reported by Semafor and confirmed by Fox News Digital. \"From bureaus around the world, our award-winning international team regularly scoops and outshines the New York Times, Wall Street Journal and other major news outlets, despite already having significantly fewer reporters,\" they continued. \"Cutting this deeply sourced, battle-hardened and tireless staff would hinder The Post’s ability to respond to the biggest news developments on the horizon.\" On Monday, Washington Post staffers launched a social media campaign. \"Hi @JeffBezos. We will never forget your support for our essential work documenting the war in Ukraine, which still rages. Your wife has called our team ‘badass beacons of hope.’ We risk our lives for the stories our readers demand. Please believe in us and #SaveThePost,\" Ukraine bureau chief Siobhán O'Grady wrote on X. Ukraine correspondent Lizzie Johnson shared a photo of herself working and said she was doing so without power, heat or running water and, despite difficulties, is \"proud to be a foreign correspondent\" at the paper. \"I love my job. Every day, I put my life on the line for my job. And I would very much like to keep my job, telling stories from the front lines of a war that is reshaping the world. (I think Washington Post readers would agree int’l coverage is vital.) Please @JeffBezos,\" Johnson wrote. NY POST, WSJ, NY TIMES AND WASHINGTON POST ALIGN AGAINST TRUMP ADMIN OVER ICE OPERATION IN MINNEAPOLIS Iran correspondent Yeganeh Torbati pleaded with Bezos to allow her coverage to continue. \"Since June, I've reported on US/Israeli strikes, a dire water crisis, state coercion of the private sector, and now, horrific govt violence against protesters. I want nothing more than to keep doing this important work. #SaveThePost,\" Torbati wrote. Middle East correspondent Loveday Morris posted, \"Today a source warned me that my reporting lines could have me killed. Just an average day as a foreign correspondent. I can’t count the number of times I’ve come under fire or had windows rattle from blasts. Our international staff risk so much to bring home news. #SaveThePost.\" White House bureau chief Matt Viser also addressed Bezos. \"Our foreign colleagues are vital in shedding light on what is happening in the world. Over the past five years covering the White House at @washingtonpost, it’s impossible to overstate how much we rely upon them and how diminished we’d be without them. #SaveThePost @JeffBezos,\" Viser wrote. EX-WASHINGTON POST FACT CHECKER HITS ‘ABSENTEE OWNER’ BEZOS, TELLS HIM TO COMMIT TO SAVING PAPER OR SELL IT Many other Washington Post employees took to X with similar messages. The letter to Bezos and social media campaign came after an onslaught of negative information spooked employees. The Washington Post informed staffers late Friday that it wouldn't send sports reporters to the upcoming Winter Olympics in Italy, although that decision was reportedly reversed on Monday. On Saturday, Puck's Dylan Byers reported that \"massive\" layoffs were coming to the Washington Post and a \"rumor\" is that the sports desk could be completely shuttered, and the foreign desk would also be \"hit hard.\" New York Times reporter Erik Wemple, a former Post media scribe, reported that the sports section was instructed not to book travel assignments for its Washington Nationals beat writers who were expected to cover the team in spring training. The Times also reported that \"foreign staff have been told explicitly that their jobs are at risk,\" and that they were instructed not to travel to high-risk zones as of Feb. 1, with many assuming that decisions are tied to looming cuts. CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE The Washington Post did not immediately respond to a series of questions and a request for comment. Bezos, who purchased the paper in 2013 for $250 million, was called an \"absentee owner\" by former Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler last year. \"He has to be committed to it. If he's not committed to it, he should find someone else to own it,\" Kessler told Fox News Digital in August. Bezos also took heat from employees in 2024 when he abruptly axed the paper's planned endorsement of Kamala Harris for the White House. The surprising decision to endorse no one for the presidency shortly before the election sparked massive subscriber losses and a slew of staff resignations. Last year, Washington Post publisher and CEO William Lewis told staffers they should consider taking a buyout if they don't feel \"aligned\" with the paper's direction, which has included a revamping of the opinion section toward more championing of American values.

Gavin Newsom is considering running for the White House, noting how badly the Golden State is being run under the “incompetent” Democrat’s leadership.\n\n“I’m amazed Gavin wants to run for office,” Trump told The California Post Friday in an Oval Office interview after his administration sued California over sanctuary policies, accused the state of fraud and clawed back federal funding.\n\nTrump, who owns a golf course in California, made clear he is not a fan of the state under Newsom’s leadership. \n\n“People love the dream of California, but they hate what’s happening to them,” Trump said.\n\nThe state needs “proper leadership,” he said, arguing they are not getting it with their current governor.\n\n“Gavin’s incompetent,” he said.\n\nNewsom, who has been ripping off Trump’s brash social media style to raise his national profile, is leading the polling for the 2028 Democratic presidential primary, according to RealClearPolitics survey averages.\n\nNewsom has 24% support among Democrats, compared to former Vice President Kamala Harris (21%), former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg (11%) and New York City Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (8%).\n\nTrump predicted that Newsom’s record in California will haunt him on any campaign trail, in particular his “train to nowhere” high-speed rail project that is meant to connect Los Angeles to San Francisco.\n\nThe rail project — which costs $135 billion — is America’s most expensive train project to date. \n\nNewsom bragged it was “back on track” during his State of the State speech earlier this month. \n\n“Speaking of tracks, we’re finally laying them,” Newsom said, noting that more than 60 miles of guideway have been poured in the Central Valley, land has been acquired, and there is environmental clearance for most of the route.\n\nThe president made clear he’s not a fan.\n\n“He has the train, the train to nowhere, that was supposed to be a simple train that went from San Francisco to Los Angeles,” he said. “It’s the greatest cost run over that I’ve ever seen.”\n\n“I could have built that thing, and I could have built that thing in one year,” Trump said.\n\nThe train was originally scheduled to be completed six years ago in 2020. The new target date is sometime in 2030. But that would only be for a partial Central Valley segment between Bakersfield and Merced — far from the major cities. \n\nAdditionally, the project has been besieged by funding problems. Billions in federal dollars have been pulled, restored, and pulled again over the years — leaving California taxpayers on the hook to keep construction alive.\n\nIt’s not the only thing off track.\n\nTrump said his relationship with Newsom has gone from friendly in his first term to now “hopeless.”\n\n“I used to get along with him, but now it’s sort of a hopeless situation. They’ve gone radical left. They’re crazy,” he said. \n\nNewsom, who is weighing a 2028 White House bid, was in Davos, Switzerland, the same time as Trump, for the World Economic Forum.\n\nHe made a splash criticizing Trump’s actions in office and accusing the assembled world leaders of bending the knee to the US president.\n\nTrump confirmed to The Post the two men spoke in Switzerland but declined to get into the details of the conversation. \n\n“I saw him in Davos,” he said. “I spoke to him. I spoke to him fine.”","summary":"Trump, who owns a golf course in California, made clear he is not a fan of the state under Newsom's leadership.","url":"https://nypost.com/2026/01/26/us-news/trump-blasts-gavin-newsom-with-two-word-insult/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/newspress-collage-si3getwfp-1769458581223.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1769440630&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/HxNsx1Mr-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2026-01-26 20:18:35","author":"Emily Goodin,Marisa Schultz,Steven Nelson","authors":["Emily Goodin","Marisa Schultz","Steven Nelson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.261},{"id":396395706,"title":"Who is Tom Homan? What to know as 'border czar' heads to Minnesota","text":"President Donald Trump is dispatching Tom Homan, his border czar, to Minneapolis after federal agents shot and killed a protester there over the weekend.\n\nThe city has erupted after the Jan. 24 death of Alex Pretti, the second U.S. citizen who federal agents have killed in the span of a month.\n\nRepublicans and the Trump administration leapt to the officers' defense in the wake of the killing, claiming Pretti was brandishing a gun at them. But video showed Pretti was holding a phone, not a gun, when agents took him to the ground and shot him.\n\nHoman, a longtime veteran of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, is known for his calls to target what he calls the \"worst of the worst\" migrants who have committed violent crimes and are in the U.S. illegally.\n\nHoman \"has not been involved\" in Minnesota, but \"knows and likes many of the people there,\" the president wrote Monday morning, Jan. 26. In the same post Trump also suggested a link between the ongoing protests and the social services fraud in Minnesota surfaced over the past five years, which drew the administration to focus on Minnesota in the first place.\n\nTrump's press secretary Karoline Leavitt wrote on social media that Homan will manage ICE operations on the ground.\n\nHere’s what you need to know about Tom Homan, Trump's border czar.\n\nWho is Tom Homan? \n\nThen-President-elect Donald Trump announced in November 2024 that Homan, a senior immigration official in his first administration, would serve as “border czar,” overseeing border enforcement along with maritime and aviation security. \n\n“I’ve known Tom for a long time, and there is nobody better at policing and controlling our Borders,” Trump wrote in a social media post.\n\nA former police officer in New York, Homan began his federal career in 1984 as a U.S. Border Patrol agent stationed in the San Diego border sector. He joined the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, the predecessor of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Citizenship and Immigration Services, in 1988 as a special agent based in Phoenix. He served in various roles at the agency for nearly two decades. \n\nUpon the creation of ICE in 2003, Homan served in various leadership roles pertaining to investigations and coordination with other law enforcement agencies. He accepted the position of ICE's assistant director for enforcement during the Obama administration and he helped develop strategies, methods and tools to aid the agency's Enforcement and Removal Operations.\n\nHoman served as the executive associate director of ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations before being appointed by Trump as acting director of ICE. \n\nAn outspoken supporter of Trump, Homan consistently has defended Trump's immigration policies.\n\n“I’ve got a message to the millions of illegal aliens that (President) Joe Biden has released into our country,” Homan said at the 2024 Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. “You better start packing now.” \n\nHoman has championed the hard-line “zero-tolerance” policy which led to family separations at the Southwestern border during Trump's first term.\n\nWhat did Tom Homan do in Trump’s first administration? \n\nHoman served as the former acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement during President Trump’s first administration. Homan was one of Trump’s earliest appointments, joining in January 2017. \n\nAs acting ICE director, Homan increased worksite raids and arrests of undocumented immigrants after a presidential memorandum from Trump that lifted Obama-era directives on ICE’s enforcement priorities. \n\nDuring the Trump administration’s first 100 days, ICE arrested more than 40,000 immigrants, including 1,770 in Arizona. A third of the arrests in Arizona had no criminal record, according to statistics released by ICE to The Arizona Republic. \n\nImmigrant-rights advocates criticized Homan for his aggressive enforcement of immigration law. In July 2017, the late U.S. Rep. Raúl Grijalva, D-Ariz., and other members of Congress sent a letter to ICE calling for more data transparency on the agency’s facilities and detainees. \n\nHoman resigned from his role in February 2018 and said at the time that he would retire. He called his decision to retire “bittersweet.” \n\nWhat did Tom Homan do after leaving Trump’s first administration? \n\nAfter leaving his position, Homan served as a Fox News contributor and joined the Heritage Foundation in 2022 as a visiting fellow, where he authored regular commentary pieces.\n\nHis columns called for the impeachment of then-Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, described the bipartisan border bill under consideration in Congress as a “backroom political ploy,” and called for more congressional oversight on then-President Joe Biden's border and immigration policies. \n\nHe was also listed as a contributor to the Heritage Foundation’s controversial blueprint, “Project 2025,” developed in anticipation of Trump’s potential reelection. Trump distanced himself from the agenda on the campaign trail. \n\nHoman founded Border 911 Foundation Inc., which says it fights against “a border invasion\" by educating \"the American people about the facts of a non-secure border.\" The group organized the \"Defend America Rally\" event held in Scottsdale in May 2023, where Homan and 2024 Republican Senate nominee Kari Lake spoke to supporters.\n\nHoman became a leading surrogate on immigration and deportations during the 2024 election cycle.\n\n“It’s going to be a well-targeted, planned operation conducted by the men of ICE. The men and women of ICE do this daily. They’re good at it,” Homan said in an interview with CBS’ “60 Minutes” . “When we go out there, we’re going to know who we’re looking for. We most likely know where they’re going to be, and it’s going to be done in a humane manner.” \n\nHoman was asked whether mass deportations could be done without separating families. \n\n“Of course there is,” he said. “Families can be deported together.” \n\nWhat does 'border czar' mean?\n\nRepublicans frequently criticized Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential race for her role in the Biden administration’s immigration policies, often labeling her as the administration’s “border czar.” The title reflected her involvement in diplomatic efforts to address migration with officials from Mexico and Central American countries, including Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras.\n\nBiden tasked Harris with tackling the root causes of migration, focusing on factors that drive people to leave their home countries for the United States.\n\n“I’ve asked her … to lead our efforts with Mexico and the Northern Triangle and the countries that help — are going to need help in stemming the movement of so many folks, stemming the migration to our southern border,” Biden said in March 2021.\n\nTrump’s designation of “border czar” for Homan is not an official title within the Department of Homeland Security. But Homan has advised the president on law enforcement and his deportation agenda.\n\nHoman has consistently called for a targeted approach and downplayed concerns that any American citizens would be removed under planned mass deportation operations.\n\n\"President Trump has made it clear we will prioritize public safety threats and national security threats first. And that's what the focus should be,\" he told Fox News’ Sean Hannity in 2024.\n\nFormer Republic reporter Raphael Romero Ruiz contributed to this article.\n\nGoodykoontz: How stupid does Karoline Leavitt think we are? | Opinion","url":"https://eu.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/immigration/2026/01/26/what-is-a-border-czar-tom-homan/88364318007/","image":"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2025/04/08/PPHX/82999081007-tom-homan-341.jpg?auto=webp&crop=3343,1881,x0,y0&format=pjpg&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-26 20:15:04","author":"The Arizona Republic","authors":["The Arizona Republic"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.081},{"id":396350498,"title":"Education Department Celebrates School Choice While Lefties Dumb Down Standards","text":"ED issued a Jan. 26 press release to celebrate National School Choice Week. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon declared, “During National School Choice Week, we celebrate how school choice has changed the lives of millions of students by empowering parents and families to choose a school or program that best meets their child’s needs.”\n\nMcMahon then explained how the administration is helping expand school choice:\n\nThat's why the Trump Administration has worked to invest a record $500 million for charter school expansion, support the first-ever federal tax credit for education scholarships, and most importantly, return education to the states – so that decisions are made closest to the child. Happy National School Choice Week, and here’s to giving parents more power, educators more flexibility, and students more freedom to be successful in 2026!\n\nI know multiple people who work in the school system, most of them in the public school system, and they all agree more or less that standards are lower, especially for discipline. An Arizona school therapist admitted to me that they cannot actually discipline the kids at all. A Texas high school English teacher is trying to lobby her administration to stop giving endless extensions and extra credit after not a single student submitted all assignments on time for the quarter. Children are essentially told they will pass no matter what they do, and therefore, they only do whatever they feel like doing.\n\nUnfortunately, our public schools are so taken over by woke teachers' unions and activists that it has become incredibly difficult for any teacher who does have higher standards or who is not a fervent socialist ideologue to survive long in the public school system. That makes education even worse, because most of the teachers who make a career of it are ignorant ideologues. As of last year, U.S. students' math and reading scores had hit a historic low — again.\n\nRecommended: Trump Sends Tom Homan to Minnesota\n\nAlso, last year, lefty Education Week promoted some school districts’ decisions to get rid of class rankings and weighted GPAs, putting forth various unconvincing arguments that it is unfair and traumatizing to do otherwise. Some schools that implemented \"no-fail\" policies in recent years were mystified when class attendance went down, and students stopped turning in work. The idea that it is \"unfair\" to rank students based on their effort and results, or that students must always be shielded from the consequences of their actions, is incredibly pernicious. It also fails to prepare kids for the real world, which is partly why my generation (Gen Z) has such a hard time holding a job.\n\nIn September, the Chicago Teachers Union honored a cop killer. After Charlie Kirk's death, a whole slew of teachers and school employees celebrated the assassination. In July, the National Education Association union voted to fight Trump administration policies, but misspelled \"fascist\" as applied to the president. American Federation of Teachers union boss Randi Weingarten, who kept schools closed way too long during the COVID-19 lockdowns as she lobbied for more money, cried as she voted for Kamala Harris. The educational establishment is prioritizing \"equity\" and woke brainwashing over math and reading.\n\nAnd that is precisely why school choice is so important.","url":"https://pjmedia.com/catherinesalgado/2026/01/26/education-department-celebrates-school-choice-while-lefties-dumb-down-standards-n4948751","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2017/323/32af4169-edb8-4e8e-9044-74c4eebc2874.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-26 20:03:00","author":"Catherine Salgado","authors":["Catherine Salgado"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.232},{"id":396341212,"title":"Two Republican Senators Get Warning Sign From New Poll Ahead of Midterm","text":"Two Republican senators who are facing competitive reelection bids in this year's midterm received a warning sign about their approval rating in a poll published on Monday. Senator Susan Collins of Maine and Dan Sullivan of Alaska are the second and third least popular senators in Morning Consult’s latest poll of senators’ approval rating. Both are expected to face competitive races from Democrats who are increasingly optimistic about their chances in flipping their seat. However, polls still suggest the outcome in those races will be close in November. Newsweek reached out to spokespersons for Collins and Sullivan for comment via email. Why It Matters Historically, the party of the president loses seats in the midterms, giving Democrats optimism about their chances at gaining seats in November—particularly as Republican President Donald Trump’s approval rating has declined since his return to office last January. However, Democrats face a challenging map to Senate control and will need to win more conservative states like Alaska. Maine, which is generally more Democratic, is also a top target for the party. What to Know The Morning Consult poll on Monday showed that a majority of voters in Maine disapprove of Collins’ job performance—54 percent gave her negative marks, compared to 41 percent who said they approved of her job performance. Meanwhile, 47 percent of respondents said they disapproved of Sullivan’s performance, compared to 39 percent who approved of him. Only Senator Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, fared worse with 63 percent of respondents saying they disapproved of him. McConnell is retiring from the Senate at the end of his current term, which ends in January 2027. The poll is based on a three-month roll-up of responses from daily tracking surveys. Its margin of error varies state-by-state. Both races are expected to be competitive. The Cook Political Report classifies Maine’s race as a toss-up, while Alaska’s is viewed as “Leans Republican.“ Senator Susan Collins, a Maine Republican, attends a Senate committee hearing in Washington, D.C. on December 9, 2025. Susan Collins’ Chances of Winning Reelection in Maine Maine’s Senate race is expected to be among the closest of the midterms. Former Vice President Kamala Harris won the state by about seven points, making it a top target for Democrats. Collins, however, is a centrist Republican who has won in tough environments before, including six years earlier in 2020. It’s not clear who she will face. Governor Janet Mills and Graham Platner, a favorite among progressives, are vying for the Democratic nomination. Collins has not formally launched her campaign but has signaled intent to run again. Polls show a tight race. A Pan Atlantic Research survey from late last year showed Collins and Mills tied in a hypothetical matchup, each receiving 43 percent of the vote. Platner held a single-digit lead (43 to 42 percent) against Collins. It surveyed 820 likely voters from November 29-December 7, 2025. A Maine People’s Resource Center, which surveyed 783 Mainers from October 26-29, 2025, gave Platner a lead over Collins (45 to 41 percent) but gave Collins a lead over Mills (46 to 42 percent). Dan Sullivan’s Chances of Winning Reelection in Alaska Alaska is generally more of a conservative state, backing Trump by 13 points in November 2024. But polls show a closer-than-expected race due to the candidacy of former Representative Mary Peltola, the only Democrat who has won federal office from Alaska in recent years. She represented the state’s at-large Congressional district from 2022 to 2025. An Alaska Survey Research Poll found Peltola leading by two points (48 to 46 percent). It surveyed 1,988 likely voters from January 8-11, 2026. A Data for Progress poll from last year showed her with a single point lead (46 to 45 percent). It surveyed 823 likely voters from October 17-23, 2025. Democrats’ Challenging Senate Map Republicans currently hold a 53-47 majority in the Senate, meaning Democrats must flip three seats for a tie and four for an outright majority. Maine and North Carolina, a state Trump won by about three points, are Democrats’ top targets. In North Carolina, Republican Senator Thom Tillis is retiring. Former Governor Roy Cooper, a Democrat, and Republican Michael Whatley are running to replace him. Democrats are also defending two seats in Trump-won states—those in Georgia, where Senator Jon Ossoff is running again, and Michigan, where Senator Gary Peters is opting to retire. If Democrats win each of those races, they would still be in the minority. That means they must turn to more conservative territory like Alaska to win. Democrats are also eyeing double-digit Trump states like Iowa, Ohio and Texas as potential flip opportunities, but all would require an overperformance. What People Are Saying Morning Consult’s polling memo reads: “Roughly 2 in 5 of Maine voters approve of Republican Sen. Susan Collins’ job performance ahead of her re-election race next year. That rating, along with her 54% disapproval rating, mark improvements from respective low and high points in our tracking that dates back to the first quarter of 2017.” Nick Puglia, National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) press secretary, previously told Newsweek: “Joe Biden and liberals like Jon Ossoff caused historic inflation and opened our borders to millions of illegals. They want to force women to share bathrooms with men, raise taxes, and protect criminal illegals from deportations. Democrat policies are out of touch with the American people.” CNN data analyst Harry Enten wrote to X on January 20: “The GOP has a depression problem heading into the midterms. Their motivation to vote in 2026 is down 17 pts from 2024. Dem enthusiasm is actually up vs. 2024. The result? The Dem lead on the generic ballot rises from 5 pts overall to 16 pts among those extremely motivated.“ What Happens Next Polls will be closely watched ahead of the midterms, as Democrats hope to reclaim a majority in the House of Representatives and the Senate. Both of these races are expected to be among the most competitive of the election cycle.","summary":"Two Republicans in competitive elections are among the least popular in the country, a new Morning Consult survey found.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/two-republican-senators-get-warning-sign-from-new-poll-ahead-of-midterm-11419115","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2251051825.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-26 19:30:14","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.168},{"id":396350306,"title":"Trump tells New York Magazine he'll sue its 'a-- off' if reporter writes 'bad story' on his health","text":"President Donald Trump told a New York Magazine writer that he would \"sue the a-- off\" the magazine if it wrote a \"bad story\" about his health, according to a piece published Monday.

TRUMP CLAIMS WHITE HOUSE DOCTORS REPORT HIM IN 'PERFECT HEALTH,' SAYS HE 'ACED' THIRD STRAIGHT COGNITIVE EXAM The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital. Leavitt recently used similar language to threaten CBS News after the president sat for an interview with \"Evening News\" anchor Tony Dokoupil. The New York Times obtained audio from the moments that followed Trump's interview with Dokoupil in Michigan earlier this month, which included Leavitt warning, on behalf of the president, not to cut the tape. \"He said, ‘Make sure you guys don’t cut the tape, make sure the interview is out in full,'\" Leavitt said, according to the audio. \"He said, ‘If it’s not out in full, we’ll sue your a-- off,'\" Leavitt continued, according to the outlet.

However, in December, the Supreme Court ruled that Trump did not have authority for such deployments. \n\nSo, since then we have seen federal agents with US Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement taking the battle largely to minorities in cities with Democratic party leadership as part of the president’s violent attack on illegal immigration, a situation he has described as “the greatest invasion in history”. \n\nMinneapolis is a Democrat-run city in a Democrat-led state. The governor is Tim Walz who ran for vice-president on the Kamala Harris ticket against Trump in the 2024 election. Walz has faced allegations, which he denies, of overlooking alleged widespread fraud in the financing of public safety net programmes, supposedly involving segments of the Somali-American community. \n\nWhile most of these allegations have been refuted, they gave Trump reason to send in federal agents. This has ramped up tensions between state officials and the administration, causing brutal and unnecessary deaths in the community and pitting ordinary Minnesotans against federal government officials. \n\nHow does the situation in Minnesota reflect the second amendment right to bear arms?\n\nIt’s a reversal of virtually all of the second amendment debates that have been seen in recent years. The second amendment was introduced to the US constitution in 1791 through the Bill of Rights due to a deep mistrust of centralised military power and a desire to ensure that the newly formed federal government could not disarm the populace. \n\nThe founding fathers envisaged a “natural right of resistance and self-preservation”. Trump’s actions in sending in armed federal agents to conduct enforcement operations in various states appear to fulfil the founding fathers’ concerns. \n\nThe agents are trampling all over not only citizens’ second amendment right to bear arms (officials seemingly connected Pretti’s killing to him carrying a weapon) but also their first amendment right to freedom of assembly.\n\n Read more:\n Shooting of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis has put America's gun lobby at odds with the White House\n\nHow have the fatal shootings affected Trump’s popularity?\n\nTrump’s popularity is on the decline. His failure to deliver on the economic promises outlined in his election campaign, scatter-gun approach to international relations and the widening gulf between rhetoric and achievement have all damaged his standing in the polls. \n\nIn a CNN poll published on January 16, almost six in ten respondents described Trump’s first year back in office as a failure with the president focused on the wrong priorities. \n\nAnd what support he does have is ebbing rapidly as federal immigration agents appear out of control, targeting many more documented citizens than illegal migrants, spreading fear and operating as if they are above the law. \n\nWith what looks like high levels of gaslighting coming from Homeland Security officials, voters are turning against the increasing autocracy of this administration, believing in the evidence widespread across the media rather than highly contentious statements from Trump’s lieutenants. \n\nIs it unusual for former presidents to speak out the way Barack Obama and Bill Clinton have?\n\nIt certainly is. There is a longstanding tradition in the US of, and implicit agreement among, former presidents to avoid public criticism of the incumbent. Such reticence to speak is generally a sign of respect for the office and an acknowledgement of the unique and difficult challenges of the presidency. \n\nBut Trump 2.0 is no normal presidency. The 47th president’s style is both combative and retributive, and there seems to be an increasing feeling of it being out of step with the desires and best interest of the country he leads. \n\nTrump’s march to autocracy creates crises where he regards himself as the hero the country needs to overcome its ills. His predecessors take a different view. \n\nWhether it’s Obama calling out the assault on core American values or Clinton’s condemnation of the “horrible scenes” in Minneapolis as “unacceptable” and avoidable, Democrat past presidents have not held back. Notably, the only living previous Republican president, George W. Bush, has so far kept his own counsel. \n\nWhat can be done to prevent further violence?\n\nMost simply, Trump could end the deployment of federal immigration agents to Minneapolis and refrain from similar actions in the future. He is clearly looking for an off-ramp and sending his “border czar”, Tom Homan, to Minneapolis to direct operations could be the first step to de-escalation. But Trump abhors being called out as wrong and, at least beyond Minneapolis, is far more likely to double down on the immigration enforcement activities. \n\nRealistically, the most likely de-escalator is Congress showing some teeth and refusing to fund further federal immigration enforcement activity. Democrats could force another government shutdown over the issue, and need just a handful of Republicans to flip in order to refuse to sanction a 2026 budget for the Department of Homeland Security. \n\nAt a public level, the greater the scrutiny of immigration enforcement agencies, the closer the fact-checking of official statements and the more cohesive the opposition to Trump’s deportation policy, the greater the chance of effectively opposing it. \n\nIt is midterm year – and the greater the public pressure, the more likely Republican legislators are to cleave away from the Trump line. While he currently controls the levers of power, that control remains fragile. Even Trump may soon realise that overt, violent, coercive autocracy is not a vote winner.","summary":"Alex Pretti’s death has been met with global outrage.

Such a family unit would typically have home equity, savings, and a 401(k) account.\n\nA well-off family, according to the Federal Reserve benchmarks, would have a net worth of around $1.6 million – enough to have disposable income available for family trips, college funds, and regular charitable donations.\n\nTo be considered wealthy, a household’s net worth would be closer to $3.8 million – the sort of money that might open up the possibility of owning multiple properties.\n\nFinally, those in the top one percent are likely to have a wealth of $11.6 million or more and enjoy lives of obvious freedom and luxury.\n\nSchmidt’s conclusions, by his own admission, are slightly out of step with the findings of Schwab’s 2024 Modern Wealth Survey, which found that a majority of Americans considered an average net worth of $778,000 to mean “financially comfortable,” $2.5 million sufficient to signify wealth, and $11 million an indicator of elite wealth. \n\nThe current average annual wage in the United States is $82,933, according to the OECD, which ranks it fourth in the world, behind only Luxembourg, Iceland, and Switzerland, and well ahead of Canada ($69,417) and the U.K. ($63,691).\n\nNevertheless, many Americans still feel uneasy about the state of the economy and want President Donald Trump to do more to address the affordability crisis, according to the latest polls.\n\nThe economy remains the primary concern for many, with 55 percent in a CNN/SSRS survey earlier this month saying they believe Trump’s policies during his first year back in office had only made matters worse, compared to 32 percent arguing they had made an improvement, a damning verdict on his controversial reciprocal tariffs program, through which he is attempting to reset the terms of international trade. \n\nA huge 64 percent said the president has not done enough to bring down the cost of living, a key reason many people voted for him over former Vice President Kamala Harris in November 2024, with even 42 percent of Republicans saying more needs to be done to lower the price of everyday goods.\n\nWith one eye on November’s midterms, the president will hope to correct that perception Tuesday when he follows up his December trip to Pennsylvania to address the economy with a visit to Des Moines, Iowa, to address the same theme.\n\nTrump’s previous appearance at a casino in Mount Pocono saw him veer off script and, rather than offer reassurances, lash out at Democrats for pushing an “affordability hoax,” telling his audience in the Keystone State that “prices are way down” and that they had nothing to worry about. \n\nThe president can expect more pressure on the issue, given that he repeatedly promised voters during the presidential election that he would usher in a new “golden age,” revitalize manufacturing, and create untold numbers of jobs, meaning they would soon have more money than they knew what to do with, a dream yet to be realized.","summary":"An average net worth of $20,856 would be categorised as poor, whereas one of $3.8 million signifies wealth, a financial expert has said","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/net-worth-class-economy-trump-b2907851.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2026/01/26/16/40/iStock-1330967899.jpg?crop=1254,836,x0,y0&trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/mfVMsyhz-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2026-01-26 16:56:49","author":"Joe Sommerlad","authors":["Joe Sommerlad"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.026},{"id":396312100,"title":"Mid-Day Digest","text":"THE FOUNDATION\n\n“No compact among men … can be pronounced everlasting and inviolable, and if I may so express myself, that no Wall of words, that no mound of parchment can be so formed as to stand against the sweeping torrent of boundless ambition on the one side, aided by the sapping current of corrupted morals on the other.” —George Washington (1789)\n\nIN TODAY’S DIGEST\n\nExecutive News Summary\nFeatured Analysis: Armed Subversive Shot in Minneapolis\nMore Analysis\nBest of Right Opinion\nBest of Videos\n\nToday’s Meme\n\nEXECUTIVE NEWS SUMMARY\n\nThe Editors\n\nWinter storm leaves a mark: An unusually large and powerful winter storm has nearly finished dumping a colossal amount of snow and ice on the U.S. after it traveled from Arizona to Maine. Over three-quarters of a million Americans experienced power outages, with many regions warning that turning the lights back on will be a slow process. Making these long power outages even worse, reinforcing shots of bitterly cold Arctic air are forecast to move over the eastern half of the U.S. through at least next week. Nine deaths have been attributed to the storm so far — seven in the South, one in Kansas, and one in Massachusetts. Southern states saw freezing rain and ice that brought down trees and power lines, while northern states saw over 18 inches of snow.\nComer suggests leaving Minnesota to its fate: With the shooting death of anti-ICE agitator Alex Pretti by ICE agents over the weekend in Minneapolis, which has served to fuel even more anti-ICE sentiments, House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer suggested that the Trump administration pull back on immigration enforcement in Minnesota. “If I were President Trump, I would almost think about, OK, if the mayor and the governor are going to put our ICE officials in harm’s way and there’s a chance of losing more, you know, innocent lives or whatever, then maybe go to another city and let the people of Minneapolis decide, ‘Do we want to continue to have all of these illegals? Are we going to allow our governor, attorney general, and mayor to get away with this?’” A number of Republican lawmakers are also calling for a full investigation into Pretti’s death.\nDems gear up for another shutdown over ICE: Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is signaling that the budget will not be passed by the deadline this Friday, and another shutdown may be looming. Congress has been passing the budget in separate appropriations bills this month rather than via the titanic omnibus bills seen too often in recent years, but DHS funding is unlikely to make it past Senate Democrats. Senators Schumer, Catherine Cortez Masto, and Jack Reed have suggested dropping the DHS bill and passing the remaining five bills for other government departments. Others have suggested reworking the DHS bill, although time is limited for that with the deadline looming and the Senate out of session today due to inclement weather. Schumer’s grandstanding comes in response to the deaths of two leftist agitators who were killed as they impeded ongoing law enforcement operations.\nDon Lemon should be arrested: On Saturday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit declined the DOJ’s request to overturn a Minnesota magistrate judge’s refusal to approve arrest warrants for five anti-ICE agitators who stormed and disrupted a St. Paul, Minnesota, church’s worship service. Among the individuals the DOJ sought to arrest was former CNN personality Don Lemon. While the Eighth Circuit Court refused to overturn the judge, it concluded that the DOJ met the probable cause standard for charging Lemon and the other agitators. Lemon, meanwhile, sought to frame himself as completely innocent and insisted that the Trump administration would “go around a judge” in its efforts to prosecute him. Lemon continued to paint himself as not one of the agitators, despite participating in and defending the action as a legitimate protest.\nVirginia Dems push for highest income tax in nation: California currently imposes the highest income tax in the nation, but may not much longer if Democrats in Virginia get their way. Democrat legislators in the Commonwealth introduced legislation that would effectively increase Virginia’s top income tax rate to 13.8%. These lawmakers are couching the tax hike as making “millionaires pay their fair share of taxes.” They want to increase the state government’s annual revenue by $1 billion to fund a range of increases in welfare-related services, including education, housing, and public services. The irony is that new Democrat Gov. Abigail Spanberger focused her campaign on making Virginia affordable. This legislation would produce the exact opposite, but Spanberger has proven that her campaign messaging was intended to deceive, not inform voters of her intentions.\nCanada backs down on China deal: Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney visited China last week and said the country would embrace a partnership with that nation for the new world order. During Carney’s visit, the two countries proposed a deal to lower tariffs on Chinese EVs and Canadian agricultural products. Carney went so far as to blast the use of tariffs in a speech to the World Economic Forum, a comment that was likely directed at the U.S. president. Donald Trump said he would not allow Canada to serve as “a ‘Drop Off Port’ for China” to send products into the U.S. He then threatened to impose a 100% tariff on Canadian products if Canada signed the proposed deal with China. Since then, Carney has backed off the deal, saying his country has no plans to pursue it.\nSecret weapon against Venezuela? “The Discombobulator. I’m not allowed to talk about it,” said President Trump right before he revealed that it had been used in the extraction of Nicolás Maduro from Venezuela. Both Trump and Venezuelan sources have attested to the use of a secret weapon that neutralized Venezuelan air defenses, communications, and command systems before U.S. helicopters entered Caracas. “They never got their rockets off. They pressed buttons, and nothing worked,” Trump remarked. The details of the weapon remain classified, but several Venezuelan witnesses on the ground confirmed that something “like a very intense sound wave” was launched that shut down all their foreign-supplied radar and defense systems, incapacitating their ability to respond. The Trump-dubbed “discombobulator” did its job to bring about the detention of Maduro, demonstrating American dominance.\nOrwellian “kill switch” speeds ahead: Sometimes when Congress is trying to accomplish big things, like fund the Departments of War, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, and Health and Human Services, smaller things can slip through the cracks. But when that “smaller thing” is a kill switch that will automatically shut off an American’s car, voters understandably get angry. Rep. Thomas Massie proposed an amendment to be added to the funding bill that would counter a Biden-era requirement to develop a kill switch in cars aimed at stopping drunk driving. Massie’s amendment failed when 76 Republicans voted with Democrats against it. Opponents of the kill switch have rightly called it Orwellian; the pressure will be on for Republicans to propose clean legislation to kill the kill switch.\nMullahs have killed more than 30,000 protesters: The total number of Iranian protesters slain in the Islamic government’s crackdown on widespread protests across the country since December 28 has been difficult to ascertain. The official state media has put the total killed at just over 3,000, while the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency has placed the estimate at just under 5,000. Data from Iranian doctors puts the total at 16,500. However, a recent report from two senior Iranian Ministry of Health officials estimates the number to be more than 30,000. And that number came in just two days — January 8 and 9. Those killed were primarily by gunshot wounds, which would be in line with the Iranian regime’s use of military forces to quell the protests. If these numbers are accurate, it would represent the single largest mass killing by a government’s forces against its own people in the modern era.\n\nTrump sending border czar Tom Homan to Minnesota (NewsNation)\nDHS officials debunk viral claims ICE used five-year-old boy as “bait” (NY Post)\nIDF recovers body of final hostage Ran Gvili (Jerusalem Post)\nColumbia University picks new president after scrutiny over mishandling campus protests (NY Post)\n\nThe Executive News Summary is compiled daily by Jordan Candler, Thomas Gallatin, Sterling Henry, and Sophie Starkova.

Of course, nothing like that has happened in the sanctuary state of Minnesota or anywhere else, and we commend our law enforcement officers for their remarkable restraint amid untold thousands of tension-filled encounters with not-so-peaceful provocateurs.\n\nAnd because of this, we can say unequivocally: Had Renee Good and Alex Pretti been peaceful protesters rather than violent agitators obstructing federal law enforcement operations, they’d be alive today. Full stop.\n\nThe video of the Pretti shooting is grim, as shootings always are.\n\nAs The Wall Street Journal reports, “In the hours after the shooting, the Department of Homeland Security alleged that Pretti ‘violently resisted’ disarmament until officers fired ‘defensive shots.’ But bystander footage … contradicts that version of events. The footage appears to show a federal officer pulling a handgun away from Pretti. Less than a second later, an agent fires several rounds.”\n\nThat’s a troubling assessment, to be sure, and it appears that DHS Secretary Kristi Noem got a bit out over her skis in her initial explanation of events. But prudent people, from President Donald Trump all the way down, are right to refrain from rendering a judgment until all the facts are in, all the officers involved have been interviewed, and all the video footage has been thoroughly reviewed.\n\n“We’re looking, we’re reviewing everything and will come out with a determination,” said the president yesterday during a five-minute phone interview with the Journal. “I don’t like any shooting. But I don’t like it when somebody goes into a protest, and he’s got a very powerful, fully loaded gun with two magazines loaded up with bullets also. That doesn’t play good either.”\n\nMinnesota is a right-to-carry state, and Pretti was indeed carrying — which he had every right to do. But one has to question the wisdom of wading into a tense law enforcement operation with a loaded weapon if your intent is merely to peacefully protest. In any case, it’s rather rich to see all these leftists suddenly finding their religion on Second Amendment rights.\n\nAs our Mark Alexander, himself a former law enforcement officer, notes, “In a confrontation with police, there is no obligation that they stop and ask about your carry permit. That’s a red herring. And it’s not clear whether, when resisting arrest, Pretti, at some point, reached for his weapon.”\n\nIf only Minnesota’s state and local law enforcement officials were working with their federal brothers rather than against them. To this point, President Trump took to ALL CAPS to say, “LET OUR ICE PATRIOTS DO THEIR JOB!” while adding that failed Governor Tim Walz and insurrectionist Mayor Jacob Frey “are inciting Insurrection, with their pompous, dangerous, and arrogant rhetoric!”\n\nIn addition, Trump took to Truth Social to announce that he’s sending Border Czar Tom Homan to Minnesota. “He has not been involved in that area,” said Trump, “but knows and likes many of the people there. Tom is tough but fair, and will report directly to me.” Homan, as you’ll recall, is the career law-enforcement professional who was presented with the nation’s highest civil service award by none other than Barack Obama — and then promptly branded a Nazi when he answered Donald Trump’s call to service.\n\nSpeaking of Nazis, I give you Governor Walz, who disgracefully demagogued over the weekend, “We have got children in Minnesota hiding in their houses afraid to go outside. Many of us grew up reading that story of Anne Frank. Somebody’s gonna write that children’s story about Minnesota.”\n\nIf only somebody would write a children’s story about the need for a civil society to enforce its laws. And about the difference between peaceful protest and violent insurrection.\n\nComment | Share\n\nMORE ANALYSIS\n\nNate Jackson: Unpacking the Left’s Anti-ICE Strategy — Clearly, leftist agitators are training and organizing to incite exactly the kinds of hostilities that are getting people killed.

After all, of the Democratic primary field’s six candidates, five reside in Saginaw County: Brandell Adams, Martin Blank, Chedrick Greene, Pamela Pugh and Serenity Hope Salak.\n\nOne candidate, William Morrone, hails from Bay County.\n\nThe state Senate district encompasses parts of Bay, Midland and Saginaw counties, including their namesake cities that also serve as their highest-density population centers.\n\nSince its boundaries were drawn during a 2021 statewide redistricting process, the 35th District’s voters have only elected one person: Rivet, a Democrat from Bay City. \n\nThe district maintains overlapping interests and industries, but each of its three counties possess distinct qualities and political leanings, as evidenced by the way its residents tend to vote in elections.\n\nPerhaps one of the measuring tools to best gauge the state of those leanings involves examining how each county has voted in presidential elections.\n\nAll three counties favored Republican Donald Trump in the 2024 election. But the margins of victory in each community revealed Saginaw County was the most enthusiastic for the Democratic opponent, Kamala Harris. There, 47.7% of voters favored Harris. In both Bay and Midland counties, meanwhile, the Democrat received about 6 percentage points fewer votes than in Saginaw County.\n\nThe margins have changed over the generations, but those political party preferences aren’t new. Midland County has not voted for a Democrat for president since 1964 and Bay County has favored sending a Republican to the White House since 2016. Before Trump, Saginaw County had not voted for a GOP presidential candidate since 1984.\n\nSo, will it be a challenge for a Democrat from a lighter-red county such as Saginaw County to win over swing voters in neighboring communities that traditionally lean further to the conservative right? Will that even matter in the primary phase of a special election?\n\nMLive posed these questions to all six Democratic hopefuls. \n\nOf the four candidates who responded, three acknowledged the communities’ differences but stated the district as a whole carries common needs that their respective campaigns’ policy ideas would answer. Another candidate — Morrone, the lone hopeful from outside Saginaw County — said his Bay County roots in part position him best to understand the needs of all three counties.\n\nPride, pain, opportunity\n\nOne factor that could help the candidates increase their name recognition and communicate their messages to constituents across the district: money.\n\nCampaign finance filings published last week on the Michigan Secretary of State finance disclosure webpage showed Greene reported more than double the amount of contributions than the next-closest Democrat, Pugh. In fact, Greene’s campaign contributions and expenditures were larger than anyone in the candidate field, including the four Republicans in the race.\n\nThe state filings showed Greene’s campaign contributions totaled $263,752.85, while his expenditures totaled $222,598.76.\n\nBy comparison, the reports showed Pugh’s campaign contributions totaled $120,629.04 with expenditures of $99,520.75. No other Democrat reported contributions larger than $18,585.\n\nThe Democratic candidates who responded to MLive said their ability to connect with the district constituents’ needs will determine their success in courting votes.\n\nGreene in a statement said he and his campaign team have listened to constituents in an effort “to know the points of pride, pain and opportunity” in each of the district’s distinct communities.\n\nStill, he said, there are shared priorities in each county that allow his campaign to offer solutions that would benefit the entire district.\n\n“The issues that consistently rise to the top across our Great Lakes Bay Region are affordability, safety and our freedoms,” said Greene, a Saginaw firefighter who earned the endorsement of Rivet.\n\nPugh, an elected member of the Michigan State Board of Education with a history of courting and receiving votes from constituents outside of her home county, in a statement said she views District 35 as sharing in “core beliefs, values and concerns.”\n\n“Across Saginaw, Bay, and Midland, voters are focused on the same priorities: good-paying jobs; rising cost burdens driven by policy choices that favor corporate interests while leaving working families behind; affordable housing and childcare; strong public schools; reliable infrastructure; and access to health care,” she said.\n\nAdams, who also serves as chairman of the Saginaw County Democratic Party, in a statement said his campaign was committed to reaching voters in all corners of District 35.\n\n“I’ve listened to (constituents’) stories from rural communities to urban neighborhoods, and I know that when everyone participates, we’ll get a senator with a real mandate to deliver results,” Adams said. “That’s why my team and I are knocking on doors, making calls, and listening everywhere: to ensure (the constituency’s) voice strengthens mine in Lansing.”\n\nStanding in the gap\n\nMorrone in a statement said Saginaw and Midland counties’ voters share the fewest commonalities among people in the 35th District’s communities.\n\n“I just don’t see a candidate from Saginaw being able to understand and demonstrate the ability to work with Saginaw, Midland and Bay City jobs, housing, politics and health care,” said Morrone, who works as chief medical examiner in Bay County. \n\nBecause of his background in Bay County, the Democrat said he was the candidate best positioned to understand voters in the two neighboring counties.\n\nHe said “purple” Bay City was “standing in the gap” between “red” Midland and “blue” Saginaw.\n\n“Saginaw voters cannot identify or understand the Midland area; Midland culture and resources are outside of the Saginaw focus,” Morrone said. “I’m the moderate in the middle. Bay City people can appeal to Midland voters. Bay City people can appeal to Saginaw voters.”\n\nMorrone said his career has involved work in Midland and Saginaw as well, providing him a perspective of both communities.\n\n“I’ve seen 400,000 patients in 20 years, and I’ve seen these counties through their eyes,” Morrone said. “That’s an advantage. No other candidate can claim it.”\n\nOther candidates disagreed Morrone was the lone hopeful able to relate to the district in its entirety.\n\n“In our diverse district spanning three unique counties and diverse communities, I’m personally committed to reaching every single voter — not just because it builds trust and drives turnout, but because no community should be left out of the conversation that shapes our collective future,\" Adams said.\n\nPugh said her professional experience in public service across the region and state allows her to appeal to voters of all types of backgrounds. She served as chief public health advisor to Flint during the administration of former Mayor Karen Weaver and has remained a member of the State Board of Education since 2014.\n\n“I’ve worked alongside scientists, educators, public-health professionals, local leaders, and community organizations throughout Saginaw, Bay, and Midland counties for years,” Pugh said. “I have deep relationships across the district, and my family has been engaged in youth STEAM education for nearly four decades.”\n\nGreene said his campaign’s messaging to the district’s constituents does not vary depending on the community.\n\n“My message focus — how I’m the right leader for this moment and district to stand up to MAGA extremists to improve affordability through lower costs and better-paying jobs, keep our kids and communities safe, and defend our freedoms and democracy — is the same whether I am at a candidate forum in Bay, a meet and greet in Midland, or talking with union members in Saginaw,” Greene said.\n\nThe campaign of Salak, who worked as an eligibility specialist at the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, declined to respond to questions from MLive.\n\nThe campaign of Blank, a trauma surgeon at Covenant HealthCare in Saginaw, did not respond to messages from MLive.\n\nThe winner of the February Democratic primary election will face the victor in the GOP primary that same day. Voters then will choose between the Democratic and Republican winners in the Tuesday, May 5, special election, sending the victor to Lansing.\n\nThe Republican candidates are Jason Tunney, Chadwick Twillman, Christian Velasquez and Andrew Wendt.","summary":"Five of six Democratic candidates live in Saginaw County while competing for District 35, which also spans parts of the deeper-red counties of Bay and Midland.","url":"https://www.mlive.com/news/saginaw-bay-city/2026/01/democratic-state-senate-hopefuls-debate-will-geography-matter-this-election.html","image":"https://www.mlive.com/resizer/v2/CJT7INZWRJHW3EUL2STMD5G5AM.JPG?auth=4ca3b4a75c7e1a8a06645478c0a31f03a77f7cadf28f1a9561537c64b7598288&width=1280&smart=true&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-26 14:30:00","author":"Justin Engel","authors":["Justin Engel"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.128},{"id":396249932,"title":"Victor Joecks: Can the Vances Make It Cool to Have Kids?","text":"Vice President J.D. Vance is putting his own spin on MAGA — Make America Grow Again.\n\nVance and Second Lady Usha Vance recently announced that she is pregnant. Their fourth child, a boy, is due in June. Usha isn’t the only woman connected to the White House who is expecting. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt and Katie Miller, wife of Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, are both pregnant, too.\n\nTalk about leading by example. This baby boom fits perfectly with the vision J.D. Vance articulated at last year’s March for Life.\n\n“I want more babies in the United States of America,” Vance said. “I want more happy children in our country, and I want beautiful young men and women who are eager to welcome them into the world and eager to raise them.”\n\nSadly, an increasing number of people aren’t interested. A recent New York Times poll found that among childless 18-to-29-year-olds, just 57% said they would like children in the future.\n\nAmong all childless women, the rate was 32%, while among men it was 43%. There’s a stark partisan divide here, too. Just 25% of former Vice President Kamala Harris voters said they wanted kids. Among President Donald Trump voters, it was 43%. These percentages are lower because the sample includes those aged 45 and older.\n\nIt’s unsurprising then that America’s fertility rate hit a record low in 2024. The fertility rate has been below replacement level for more than 15 years. This baby bust will have significant negative consequences in the future.\n\nThe problem is worse in other countries, especially in Asia. Last year, China had the same number of births as in around 1738, Reuters reported. Its population is now shrinking. South Korea’s anemic fertility rate is on pace to cut the country’s population in half within 60 years.\n\nGovernments around the world have tried in vain to reverse this trend. Their main strategy has been throwing money at it, which hasn’t worked. That’s because raising a child requires far more work and commitment than a full-time job. Even payments worth thousands of dollars do little to change that calculus.\n\nThink of the irony. Modern society put a man on the moon, but can’t reproduce itself as well as civilizations that used stone tools. Here are some reasons why.\n\nFirst, the sexual revolution disconnected sex from marriage and reproduction. Young men have always wanted to have sex. Throughout human history, societies steered that desire toward marriage, a foundational pillar of civilization. This benefitted societies by channeling the strength and competitiveness of young men into something productive — providing for their families. It also led to more babies.\n\nToday, teenagers can readily view pornography on their phones. Sex isn’t saved for marriage, but treated as a recreational activity. If that leads to pregnancy, the next step isn’t for a man to marry his girlfriend, but to drive her to an abortion clinic.\n\nAmerica slaughters 1 million preborn babies annually. Experts then wonder why the birth rate is so low.\n\nNext, modern feminism told women to find fulfillment in climbing the corporate ladder, not motherhood. That’s the path to misery. As the Institute for Family Studies has detailed, marriage and children bring parents greater connection and happiness.\n\nFinally, popular culture doesn’t promote marriage and motherhood. Social media glamorizes vacation selfies, not comforting a crying baby three times in one night. Mothers, especially moms of large families, should be treated like societal rock stars.\n\nWhat’s needed isn’t just better laws, but a change in personal priorities. People need to believe the truth.\n\nFor a married couple, having kids is one of the most meaningful and rewarding things anyone could ever do. The Vance family is living proof of that.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2026 CREATORS.COM","url":"https://patriotpost.us/opinion/124588-can-the-vances-make-it-cool-to-have-kids-2026-01-26","image":"https://img.patriotpost.us/01GR4QNK1K7PV7B16TYRNJ89RV.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-26 14:25:02","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.206},{"id":396262198,"title":"Stunning twist of fate that saw Brittany leave Patrick Mahomes weeks after he was drafted by the Chiefs...","text":"Of all places, it was an airport in Iceland where his future with the Kansas City Chiefs, for a moment at least, may have felt overwhelming for Patrick Mahomes. \n\nIt was July 2017, three months after being drafted by the team. He had moved from Texas to Missouri and dived head first into Andy Reid's playbook, which he had packed into his suitcase. Figure that out, and he would hold the keys to the rest of his career as an NFL quarterback.\n\nBut he was in Iceland for his girlfriend, childhood sweetheart Brittany. In a remarkable twist of fate, she was moving overseas weeks after the Chiefs traded up to the 10th NFL Draft pick to swoop for Mahomes, a decision that would change the course of football history.\n\nBrittany, however, was chasing her own dreams. In an opportunity she couldn't refuse at 22 years old, she had a chance to forge a professional soccer career in Iceland after an outstanding run in college with the University of Texas at Tyler. This was her first step on that journey and it forced the young couple, who had been together since the age of 15, into a long distance relationship.\n\nAs they touched down in Europe, Patrick was spotted by a group of Chiefs fans, about 3,300 miles away from Kansas City, who raced over to greet their surprised new quarterback. If the boy from Texas didn't already know how famous he was quickly becoming, it was another thing he was having to learn fast.\n\nThen, out of the crowd came another figure in Sigurbjart Sigurjonsson, the president of the Icelandic team Brittany was playing for, and the man whose home they would be staying in.\n\n'I had no idea who he was,' Sigurjonsson said. 'He was here with her for ten days, exploring the country. We didn't suspect he was some kind of star. They often asked where they could go to eat, and we always suggested moderately expensive places because we didn't think they had much money.'\n\nIronically, the opposite was true. Mahomes' rookie contract with the Chiefs was worth $16.4milion - making him a billionaire in Iceland.\n\nThey stayed in the small town of Mosfellsbaer in the east of the country, renowned for its natural beauty. As Brittany settled in, they explored hiking trails, visited lagoons and went whale watching. But Patrick still made time to study his playbook.\n\n'I didn't always understand what he was doing with a flimsy folder that he was constantly looking through,' Sigurjonsson said in 2018. 'Of course, he was going over all the systems and preparing for the season.' \n\nAn NFL quarterback for a house guest wasn't easy. The beds in Sigurjonsson's spare room weren't big enough for Mahomes and his 6-foot 2, 225-pound frame.\n\n'He was too big for the beds, so he had to sleep on the couch,' Sigurjonsson explained. 'It turned out to be difficult to host him.'\n\nBut otherwise, the young couple were unassuming as they explored one of Europe's most fascinating countries.\n\n'We sometimes joke that he could have bought the whole block, set it on fire and not noticed,' Sigurjonsson said. 'He got to live with me for free and enjoyed it.'\n\nAfter nine nights on the sofa, Patrick headed back to the United States and Brittany began her shot at making it as a professional in the other football. In 2013, she had gone to Texas Taylor as an aspiring cheerleader before friends encouraged her to return to the soccer field.\n\n'I don't know where it came from,' she said years later, reflecting on her college time. 'In my senior year, I just got this insane attitude, drive, where I was like \"I'm not losing.\"\n\nWhen she put pen to paper on her contract to go and play in Iceland in May of 2017, she was determined to become a star.\n\n'These last four years (at college) have made me fall in love with soccer all over again and want to go on and play professional,' she said. 'An opportunity opened up for me in Iceland and I could never pass up such an amazing experience to go do what I love.'\n\nWithout Patrick she began training harder than ever, gaining three pounds of muscle and developing a passion for fitness that remains to this day. But that newfound strength, however, was not enough to translate to success on the field for UMF Afturelding/Fram.\n\n'She wasn't the best player even though she was a nice girl,' Sigurjonsson said. 'She just wasn't strong enough for the Inkasso league here at home so we decided not to sign her.'\n\nBrittany struggled too, with the distance from her family and especially with the distance from her parents while Patrick was locked in on his new NFL responsibilities.\n\nShe eventually left having made five appearances for the team, scoring twice, and on her return to America joined Patrick in Kansas City where she tried to forge a new career as a fitness influencer.\n\n'Setting down roots in Kansas City was huge for us. I think the people are what we love the most about Kansas City,' Patrick said when Brittany joined him. 'We're trying to be here for a long, long time.'\n\n'By the end of my first season, I truly began to fall in love with being in the gym more than being on the soccer field,' she said on the website where she launched her personal training work.\n\n'Playing sports my whole life got me into fitness and playing in college taught me about strength training, wellness and maintaining peak fitness to perform at an elite level.'\n\nIn December 2020, the same year Patrick won his first Super Bowl with the Chiefs, the National Women's Soccer League awarded an expansion team to the Kansas City Current, where Brittany is part of the ownership group.\n\nPatrick joined that group in 2023, and the couple regularly attend games in the first stadium in the world that is purpose-built for a professional women's team. Brittany also makes effort to be available for the players and forge relationships with them away from the sport.\n\nUSWNT international and Current striker Michelle Cooper told People: 'She drops in a lot. She comes and says hi to the girls, and she's awesome.'\n\nAnd of course, since September 2023 her profile has rocketed amid her friendship with Taylor Swift. The pair have built a close bond, despite Brittany's support for Donald Trump being at odds with Swift, who backed Kamala Harris and the Democratic party at the last election.\n\nShe's sure to have a front-row seat as Swift and Mahomes' Chiefs teammate Travis Kelce get married in Rhode Island later this year - a wedding the whole world will be watching.\n\nIt's a far cry from the fjords of Iceland and something neither Brittany nor Patrick could have imagined when they landed in Reykjavik in 2017.","summary":"Of all places, it was an airport in Iceland where the future with the Kansas City Chiefs, for a moment at least, may have felt overwhelming for Patrick Mahomes. ","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/nfl/article-15471661/brittany-patrick-mahomes-iceland-soccer-kansas-city.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2026/01/21/16/105585543-0-image-m-12_1769012775993.jpg","video":"https://video.dailymail.com/video/mol/2020/07/07/5650991168381761500/1024x576_MP4_5650991168381761500.mp4","publish_date":"2026-01-26 14:11:58","author":"Editor,Jack Bezants","authors":["Editor","Jack Bezants"],"language":"en","source_country":"jp","sentiment":-0.009},{"id":396221772,"title":"The Washington Stand: NIH Discontinues Fetal Tissue Research Funding","text":"By Joshua Arnold\n\nThe day before the 2026 March for Life, the Trump administration announced a pro-life policy change that advocates have pursued for more than two decades. “Effective the date of this Notice,” announced the National Institutes of Health (NIH), “NIH funds will not be permitted for research using HFT [human fetal tissue] from elective abortions.” In response to the announcement, Science Alliance for Life and Technology President Dr. David Prentice cheered, “This is a win not just for human dignity, but also for science — and the promotion of ethical science that respects every human life.”\n\nPro-life advocates have pointed out the ethical issues behind funding such research for years. After an unborn baby is aborted, the child’s remains are then sold to researchers who use them as raw material for experiments intended to promote health science. In reality, “human fetal tissue” is a euphemism for what the average person would easily recognize as “unborn baby body parts.”\n\nJournalist David Daleiden vividly illustrated this fact in 2015 when he published undercover videos showing Planned Parenthood employees deliberately carrying out an abortion in a way to maximize the saleable value of the baby’s body parts. “David Daleiden’s undercover videos exposing the trafficking in baby body parts opened the eyes of the nation to this horrific research endeavor and helped pave the way to the current decision,” Prentice assessed.\n\nThe graphic videos provoked a furious reaction, and Daleiden was targeted with a multi-year prosecution by then-California Attorney General Kamala Harris and her successor in office, then-Attorney General Xavier Becerra. Of course, these figures went on to serve as vice president and HHS secretary in the Biden administration.\n\nHowever, not all medical research conducted with human remains is unethical. Ethically speaking, a wide chasm exists between a dying person donating their body to science and an unscrupulous profiteer deliberately ending a person’s life to sell their organs — like the Chinese Communist Party’s practice of organ harvesting.\n\nNIH did not ban all research with human fetal tissue; it prohibited funding for research using tissue obtained through elective abortion, while conceding, “NIH funds are permitted for use of research involving HFT obtained from miscarriage or stillbirth.” However, Prentice set this allowance in context, “Fetal tissue research from ethically derived sources can still continue, but the newer, more modern alternatives will likely supplant those tissue sources as well.”\n\n“Modern science has developed numerous successful and ethical alternatives to the use of aborted human fetal tissue,” Prentice told TWS. “Therapies from adult stem cells, production of ‘mouse models’ using umbilical cord blood, and development models using organoids that faithfully replicate human organ development all provide ethical and more effective alternatives to aborted baby body parts. After decades of fighting against the unethical research with fetal tissue, it’s good to see that grisly chapter of human experiments closed.”\n\n“NIH is pushing American biomedical science into the 21st century,” NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya explained. “This decision is about advancing science by investing in breakthrough technologies more capable of modeling human health and disease. Under President Trump’s leadership, taxpayer-funded research must reflect the best science of today and the values of the American people.”\n\nAs an additional justification, Bhattacharya also cited “NIH’s responsibility to ensure that research supported by taxpayer funds is scientifically rigorous, ethically sound, and justified by a maximal return on the public’s investment.”\n\nIn its Thursday announcement, NIH revealed that “NIH-supported research using human fetal tissue has declined steadily since 2019, with only 77 projects funded in Fiscal Year 2024.” This decline is due both to the advent of more promising alternative technologies and to the work of the Human Fetal Tissue Research Ethics Advisory Board. In 2020, NIH established the board to make recommendations about “whether the Secretary [of Health and Human Services] should withhold funds or not withhold funds from a proposed project because of ethical considerations.”\n\nGoing back to the George W. Bush administration, pro-life advocates have called for an end to government funding of research using the remains of aborted babies. However, researchers countered that such research greatly benefited medical science and would soon lead to abundant cures. With the help of a sympathetic media establishment and the abortion lobby, the pragmatic arguments drowned out moral ones.\n\nWhen the debate reached its height, Prentice took a sabbatical from his professorship at Indiana State University to scientifically defend the pro-life position. He argued that fetal stem cells were “ill-suited for clinical use,” had trouble integrating into the body, and could trigger a hostile immune response. For his efforts, the university punished Prentice, reducing his teaching assignments and lab privileges.\n\nPro-life advocates had greater success persuading the first Trump administration to curtail the research practice, and the second Trump administration has now finished the job by cutting off all federal funding to research using aborted human fetal tissue.\n\nPrentice concluded, “My colleagues in our new organization, Science Alliance for Life and Technology (SALT), are gratified to see the years of struggle to disseminate the truth pay off in this new announcement from NIH.”\n\nJoshua Arnold is a senior writer at The Washington Stand.","url":"https://patriotpost.us/opinion/124575-nih-discontinues-fetal-tissue-research-funding-2026-01-26","image":"https://img.patriotpost.us/01GR4QNK1K7PV7B16TYRNJ89RV.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-26 12:24:58","author":"Joshua Arnold","authors":["Joshua Arnold"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.162},{"id":396204094,"title":"What to expect in Minnesota's special legislative elections","text":"WASHINGTON (AP) — Two special elections Tuesday in heavily Democratic Twin Cities-area state legislative districts will decide control of the Minnesota House of Representatives for the third time in less than a year.\n\nRepublicans hold a 67-65 advantage in the chamber after two Democratic representatives were elected to other offices in November. The chamber has operated under a power-sharing agreement between the two parties for much of the last year.\n\nThe contests take place just days after a U.S. Border Patrol agent fatally shot a man in Minneapolis, sparking protests and renewed calls for federal immigration officers to leave the state. Earlier in January, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed a Minneapolis woman as part of an ongoing federal immigration crackdown.\n\nIn District 47A, Democrat Shelley Buck is the only candidate on the ballot, although voters have the option to vote for a write-in candidate. Buck is a former environmental nonprofit executive and former president of the Prairie Island Tribal Council.\n\nThe district is east of St. Paul. It falls mostly within Washington County but includes a portion of Ramsey County. In 2024, both Democratic state Rep. Amanda Hemmingsen-Jaeger and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris carried District 47A with about 61% of the vote in their races. Hemmingsen-Jaeger won a special election to the state Senate in 2025.\n\nIn District 64A, the nominees are Democrat Meg Luger-Nikolai and Republican Dan Walsh. Luger-Nikolai is a labor attorney who represented a statewide teachers union. Walsh runs a real estate property management company and has worked in cybersecurity and tech sales. He was the GOP nominee for this seat in 2022 and 2024.\n\nThe district is entirely within Ramsey County and stretches most of the distance between St. Paul and Minneapolis. Democratic state Rep. Kaohly Her and Harris each won the district with more than 83% of the vote in 2024. Her was elected mayor of St. Paul in 2025.\n\nWith Buck the only candidate on the ballot in District 47A, The Associated Press will treat the contest as uncontested and will call the race as soon as polls close, unless there is any indication of an organized write-in effort for another candidate.\n\nIn District 64A, Walsh will need to far outperform the approximately 15% and 17% of the vote he received in his 2022 and 2024 runs, respectively. With almost all the vote expected to be released in just one or two batches, a race call could be possible at the first sign of an overwhelming margin.\n\nThe Associated Press does not make projections and will declare a winner only when it’s determined there is no scenario that would allow the trailing candidates to close the gap. If a race has not been called, the AP will continue to cover any newsworthy developments, such as candidate concessions or declarations of victory. In doing so, the AP will make clear that it has not yet declared a winner and explain why.\n\nThere are no automatic recounts for state legislative races in Minnesota. A losing candidate may request a publicly funded recount if the margin is less than 0.5% of the total vote. The AP may declare a winner in a race that is eligible for a recount if it can determine the lead is too large for a recount or legal challenge to change the outcome.\n\nHere are some of the key facts about the election and data points the AP Decision Desk will monitor as the votes are tallied:\n\nWhen do polls close?\n\n8 p.m. local time, which is 9 p.m. ET.\n\nWhat’s on the ballot?\n\nThe AP will provide vote results and declare winners in the special elections for Minnesota state House Districts 47A and 64A.\n\nWho gets to vote?\n\nThe special elections are open to voters in state House Districts 47A and 64A. Minnesota allows voters to register on Election Day at their polling place.\n\nWhat do turnout and advance vote look like?\n\nHouse Districts 47A and 64A each had nearly 28,000 registered voters as of June 1, 2025.\n\nIn District 47A, about 23,000 voters cast ballots in the 2024 general election and about 19,000 in 2022. About half the ballots in 2024 were cast before Election Day, compared with about 31% in the 2022 midterm elections. \n\nIn District 64A, nearly 25,000 voters cast ballots in 2024 and more than 21,000 in 2022.

While the Democratic vice-presidential nominee has been urging Donald Trump to withdraw ICE agents from the state, MAGA supporters have been attacking Walz with the nickname ‘Tampon Tim,’ blaming his policies for what they allege is a surge in immigration.“Why are ICE protests so widespread in Minnesota and nowhere else? It is because Tampon Tim and Frey are fanning the flames to cover up for the fraud. Shame on them!” read a recent post on X that made use of the nickname.As the verbal sparring continues, many are asking why Walz, a 61-year-old politician, is repeatedly referred to as ‘Tampon Tim’ by Trump supporters. Political nicknames and trolling are nothing new, but what is the story behind this one?‘Tampon Tim’Politics is a game of blames and names and when a crisis occurs, each side throws both at each other. While Walz may not have been witty enough to think of one, Republicans were quick to award him with an alias: 'Tampon Tim'. The label gained traction after 2024 presidential candidate Kamala Harris announced Walz as her vice-presidential pick.At its core the name is a dig at one of Walz's policies launched in 2023. The governor signed a law requiring public schools to provide menstrual products including pads and tampons to students from grades 4 to 12. It went into effect on January 1, 2024, making Minnesota one of the twenty-eight states to have passed laws giving access to menstrual products to students. The bill's inclusive language reflects that not all people who menstruate are women and not all women get periods, therefore, the products were made available in all bathrooms regardless of gender.For anti-transgender Republicans, this became an immediate point of attack. “Tim Walz is a weird radical liberal,” the MAGA War Room account posted on X, formerly Twitter, at the time. “What could be weirder than signing a bill requiring schools to stock tampons in boys' bathrooms?” From editing Walz's face on tampons to criticising him in social media posts, they continue to do it all. But when you zoom in deeper, it's not just about policies, it's also about the ancient taboos of uncleanness and shame, associated with menstruation and women. In the Bible, the book of Leviticus defined menstruating women, and any who touched them, as unclean, and the book of Isaiah compared false idols to menstrual cloths which must be cast away. Still, many assume menstrual blood is disgusting to men and essentially when Republicans chant 'Tampon Tim' what they are screaming louder is 'ew, gross periods.' They are projecting their disdain for feminine nature and slyly calling Walz 'feminine', which to many of them is the most insulting thing you can call a man.Democrats push backWhile Republicans appear fond of the alliterative jab, Democrats have not responded with embarrassment. “How nice of the Trump camp to help publicise Gov. Tim Walz’s compassionate and common-sense policy of providing free menstrual products to students in Minnesota public schools,” Hillary Clinton wrote in a post on X at the time.The nickname has endured, resurfacing as Republicans and Democrats clash over ICE enforcement in Minnesota. Political labels have a long shelf life, and when one fails to land as intended, they are often repurposed—sometimes even embraced by the opposition.What ‘Tampon Tim’ ultimately underscores is that Walz once championed a version of masculinity rooted in empathy and public welfare—an idea praised by supporters and ridiculed by critics, but difficult to erase from the political conversation.","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/etimes/trending/tim-walz-vs-ice-why-magas-tampon-tim-nickname-is-back/articleshow/127546478.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-127546478/127546478.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-26 11:30:00","author":"Toi Trending Desk","authors":["Toi Trending Desk"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.389},{"id":396183462,"title":"Spiuni i rrem&euml; q&euml; mashtroi nj&euml; kompani nafte me vler&euml; 350 milion&euml; dollar&euml;","text":"Kur Niels Troost u takua për herë të parë me Gaurav Srivastava-n, ai mendoi se problemet e tij kishin marrë fund.\n\nTregtari i naftës me origjinë holandeze, i cili për vite me radhë kishte tregtuar naftë ruse, po përballej me sanksione të mundshme amerikane pas pushtimit të Ukrainës nga Vladimir Putini në vitin 2022. Srivastava, një biznesmen indian që jetonte në Kaliforni, tha se ishte i pozicionuar në mënyrë unike për ta ndihmuar.\n\nSrivastava i tregoi Troost-in një sekret: ai në të vërtetë ishte një operativ i CIA-s, që përdorte aktivitetet e tij të biznesit si mbulesë, dhe e argëtoi atë me histori personale për intriga ndërkombëtare dhe bëma të guximshme.\n\nBiznesmeni rreth të tridhjetave foli për trajnimin e tij në “The Farm”, kompleksi i CIA-s në Virxhinia, tregoi plagë nga një mision i fshehtë dhe përshkroi se si ishte mbajtur peng nga ISIS-i në vitin 2008 gjatë një operacioni në Republikën Demokratike të Kongos.\n\nPër të forcuar besueshmërinë e tij, Srivastava ndau fotografi të vetes me figura të rëndësishme politike dhe ushtarake, nga presidenti Joe Biden te ish-komandanti suprem i NATO-s, gjenerali Wesley Clark.\n\nPor historitë e jashtëzakonshme që rrëfente Srivastava ishin të sajuara, pretendon Troost në një padi RICO (Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act), një akuzë se ai kishte ndërtuar një skemë të organizuar mashtrimi dhe shantazhi për të vjedhur para dhe kompani. Padia thotë se Srivastava nuk ka qenë kurrë në CIA. Ajo thotë se “plagët e betejës” në fakt vinin nga një operacion në veshka gjatë fëmijërisë dhe se rrëmbimi nga ISIS nuk mund të ketë ndodhur sepse organizata terroriste “nuk operonte në RDK në vitin 2008, dhe asnjë grup i lidhur me ISIS-in nuk ekzistonte në atë rajon në atë kohë.”\n\nNë padinë e tij të re RICO, Troost pretendon se Srivastava ishte një “spiun i rremë” që kishte gënjyer për punën e tij për CIA-n si pjesë e një përpjekjeje për t’i vjedhur kompaninë prej 350 milionë dollarësh. Srivastava kërkonte paratë, pjesërisht, për të blerë një rezidencë në Kaliforni prej 24.5 milionë dollarësh, pemishte dhe një strehë kundër bombave që shërbente si bodrum vere, sipas padisë së Troost.\n\n“Për më shumë se pesë vjet, i pandehuri Gaurav Srivastava drejtoi një ndërmarrje kriminale që vodhi dhe shantazhoi dhjetëra miliona dollarë nga paditësit dhe viktima të tjera mbi bazën e narrativës së rreme gjithëpërfshirëse se Srivastava ishte një operativ i nivelit të lartë i CIA-s në mbulim jozyrtar,” thuhet në padi.\n\n“Srivastava dhe anëtarët e tjerë të ndërmarrjes mashtruan viktimat duke i bindur se Srivastava kontrollonte fuqinë e qeverisë së Shteteve të Bashkuara dhe mund të ofronte ndihmë të paçmueshme për aleatët e tij dhe të shkatërronte ata që guxonin ta sfidonin. E gjitha kjo ishte një trillim i plotë. Srivastava nuk është dhe nuk ka qenë kurrë operativ i CIA-s, apo agjent i ndonjë agjencie tjetër federale amerikane. Ai nuk është as qytetar amerikan. Ai është thjesht një mashtrues.”\n\nSot, kompania e Troost-it është në proces mbylljeje dhe po shet të gjitha asetet për të shlyer borxhet, zbulon padia.\n\nAvokati Jason Masimore, një ish-prokuror federal që përfaqëson Troost-in, i tha The Independent: “Padia dhe provat mbështetëse zbulojnë një komplot kriminal masiv të orkestruar në SHBA nga udhëheqësi i tij, Gaurav Srivastava.”\n\nSrivastava ishte në gjendje ta realizonte skemën e supozuar vetëm falë një sërë njerëzish që e ndihmonin, avokatë, bankierë dhe ish-operativë të inteligjencës, sipas Masimore, i cili tha se komploti kishte kompromentuar sigurinë kombëtare të SHBA-së dhe nivelet më të larta të udhëheqjes politike.\n\n“Troost dhe kompanitë e tij kërkojnë t’i mbajnë të pandehurit përgjegjës për sjelljen e tyre të dënueshme,” tha Masimore.\n\nPadia është hapi më e fundit në një sagë të gjatë mes dy burrave, që përfshin anëtarë të komunitetit të inteligjencës, senatorë amerikanë, zyrtarë të huaj qeveritarë dhe madje edhe yllin e muzikës pop John Legend.\n\nËshtë padia e parë që e emëron personalisht Srivastava-n si të pandehur.

Edhe Grupi Arkin, që Troost e ka paditur veçmas për shpifje, nuk reagoi. Ndërkohë, avokati i Troost, Jason Masimore, ka gjithashtu një padi për shpifje kundër Srivastava-s në gjykatë federale.\n\nNë një padi të mëparshme kundër Arkin, e transferuar nga gjykata federale në Gjykatën Supreme të Nju Jorkut, çështja u përshkrua si një histori me “tipare filmi hollivudian, spiunë të rremë, vjedhje dhe mashtrim”, por me akuza në thelb “mjaft të thjeshta”. Arkin ka mohuar se Srivastava ka punuar ndonjëherë për CIA-n ose se është paraqitur si i tillë.\n\nNë padinë e tij të re RICO në Los Anxhelos, Troost paraqet akuza të rënda ndaj Srivastava-s, i përshkruar dikur nga The Wall Street Journal si “pjesërisht Austin Powers, pjesërisht James Bond”. Edhe pse Srivastava mohon të jetë paraqitur si spiun, padia përfshin transkripte telefonike ku ai e përshkruan veten si operativ në “mbulim jozyrtar”.\n\nSipas Troost-it, për vite me radhë Srivastava ndërtoi një mashtrim të ndërlikuar, duke u shtirur si oficer i CIA-s, duke shpikur misione inteligjence dhe duke përdorur këtë identitet të rremë për të siguruar para, akses dhe ndikim. Padia pretendon se ai ka mashtruar më parë biznesmenë afrikanë, zyrtarë qeveritarë dhe madje edhe spiunë amerikanë.\n\nTroost, një tregtar veteran i naftës, thotë se u bë shënjestër kur një bashkëpunëtor e kërcënoi se do ta diskreditonte si agjent të Kremlinit pas fillimit të luftës në Ukrainë. Ai iu drejtua një kontakti që e lidhi me “Z. G”, Srivastava, i cili i premtoi se do të ndalte sulmet dhe se kishte ndikim përmes një programi të CIA-s që monitoronte naftën ruse.\n\nSipas padisë, Srivastava e bindi Troost-in se kishte mbështetje nga nivelet më të larta të qeverisë amerikane, përfshirë Biden-in, Kamala Harris, Jake Sullivan dhe Chuck Schumer. Ai madje pretendonte se kishte ndërmjetësuar marrëveshje armësh dhe kishte ndikuar në listat e ndalimit të SHBA-së për zyrtarë të huaj.\n\nNë korrik 2022, Srivastava e bindi Troost-in t’i shiste gjysmën e kompanisë Paramount me çmim të ulët, duke thënë se ishte e vetmja mënyrë për të shmangur sanksionet dhe për të vazhduar tregtinë e naftës ruse. Më vonë, përmes transfertave të ndërlikuara, ai dyshohet se nxori dhjetëra miliona dollarë nga kompania, përfshirë 25 milionë për të blerë një vilë luksoze në Los Anxhelos.\n\nKur Troost filloi të dyshonte dhe e përballi, Srivastava e kërcënoi se do ta etiketonte si agjent rus dhe do t’i bllokonte asetet. Pas prishjes së marrëveshjes në maj 2023, Srivastava dyshohet se nisi një fushatë agresive shpifjeje përmes Grupit Arkin, duke përhapur histori të rreme që e lidhin Troost-in dhe familjen e tij me krimin dhe Rusinë.\n\nEkspozimet në The Wall Street Journal dhe Financial Times në vitet 2024–2025 e çmontuan figurën publike të Srivastava-s dhe e shtynë atë të zhvendosej nga qarqet demokrate drejt atyre republikane, duke u shfaqur në konventa konservatore dhe pranë figurave si Zëvendëspresidenti J.D. Vance.\n\nNdërkohë, Troost u sanksionua nga Mbretëria e Bashkuar, BE-ja dhe Zvicra, dhe kompania e tij u detyrua të mbyllej. Padia RICO kërkon kthimin e parave të përfituara në mënyrë të paligjshme dhe dëmshpërblime të shumëfishuara, ndërsa Srivastava ende nuk ka dhënë një përgjigje zyrtare. / The Independent","url":"https://monitor.al/spiuni-i-rreme-qe-mashtroi-nje-kompani-nafte-me-vlere/","image":"https://monitor.al/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cia.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-26 11:00:46","author":"Megi Dumi","authors":["Megi Dumi"],"language":"en","source_country":"al","sentiment":-0.095},{"id":396206244,"title":"What MAGA Can Teach Democrats About Organizing—and Infighting","text":"Dare, or the Drug Abuse Resistance Education program, was created in 1983 by the Los Angeles Police Department and the Los Angeles County school district. From the start, the program was a success. Its stated goal was “to equip elementary-school children with skills for resisting peer pressure to experiment with tobacco, drugs and alcohol.” The initiative was embraced by police departments and politicians, and within just a few years the Dare curriculum had spread to more than three-quarters of the country’s school districts. More than three million students participated annually, and many were taught that even one toke can end in homelessness and despair. The group received admiring press, and was funded by Congress and various philanthropies; the budget at Dare headquarters eventually approached twenty-five million dollars a year. Nancy Reagan and the White House praised the program, and it received support from major companies, from Kmart to Kentucky Fried Chicken.\nmadd’s origins were far less auspicious; even to its founders it seemed like a long shot. In 1980, Cari Lightner, a thirteen-year-old girl who lived outside Sacramento, was killed by a drunk driver while walking to church. The man had previously been arrested four times for driving while drunk but had mostly avoided serious punishment—a pattern that continued when he was found guilty of vehicular manslaughter for Lightner’s death but given a sentence of only twenty-one months, with a portion spent in a halfway house. In response, Lightner’s mother, Candy, quit her job in real estate to found Mothers Against Drunk Driving. On her own, she began lobbying legislators, telephoning journalists, and appearing on newscasts, pushing for tougher drunk-driving laws. Eventually, women in other cities—many of whom had also been affected by drunk driving—saw those newscasts and read those articles. They sent Lightner letters asking for permission to launch madd chapters in their towns. She often mailed such volunteers a few pages with advice on how to contact local judges, monitor court cases, and petition legislators. But she essentially gave them permission to use whatever attention-getting tactics they thought best.\nOn an organizational level, Dare and madd were quite different. Dare was overseen from a central headquarters, in L.A., where staff guided nearly every aspect of operations. As Dare spread across the nation, it became an oft-cited example of what scholars of social movements call “mobilizing”—the process of educating people about a cause and then prompting them to participate in public events. When, in 1988, President Ronald Reagan declared the first National Dare Day, and hundreds of school districts let children miss classes to attend boisterous anti-drug rallies, this was mobilizing at work.\nmadd, by contrast, wasn’t particularly focussed on mobilizing. Each of its chapters was independent and largely ungoverned by headquarters; volunteers concentrated on local advocacy instead of on national activism. As a result, local madd leaders often supported sets of policy recommendations that diverged—or even conflicted—with the agendas of other chapters. Some MADD chapters pushed to prohibit alcohol sales at public events, objected to accepting funding from alcohol companies, and advocated for mandatory jail time; others argued that the group shouldn’t be anti-drinking but, rather, anti-drunk-driving, that it should welcome donations from beverage companies, and that courts should have discretion over sentencing. Meanwhile, at the top of madd, there were serious managerial problems. Lightner, who was known to staff members as the madd Queen, sometimes used the organization’s funds to pay for personal expenses, including dry cleaning and babysitting. In 1985, after reports revealed that a telemarketing firm hired by madd had pocketed much of the donations to the group in fees, the California attorney general opened an investigation. A new executive director quit after seventeen months; then a new board pushed out Lightner, who responded by criticizing the organization in the press.\nAll this turmoil, however, had the knock-on effect of making madd excel at another important aspect of social movements—what’s known as “organizing,” helping members to become leaders on their own. The chaos at headquarters led to the empowerment of local chapter heads and allowed the social bonding that a movement needs to survive. Moreover, chapter members were free to experiment with different tactics. Mark Wolfson, a professor at the University of California, Riverside, who has studied the group, has likened it to a franchise business in which a new owner is given just a bit of instruction and is then expected to find a way to prosper. “madd kind of forced volunteers to step up,” he told me. He explained that the group’s members, many of them stay-at-home mothers with little professional experience, “suddenly had to figure out how to talk to politicians and go on TV and build a community and fund-raise and network—pretty heady stuff.” Not every madd chapter thrived, but for those that did, Wolfson said, “it was an inadvertent leadership school on how to build organizations.” Lightner turned out to be easy to replace, because there were dozens of other leaders ready to take over.\nAs the Johns Hopkins political scientist Hahrie Han likes to say, “Mobilizing is about getting people to do a thing, and organizing is about getting people to become the kind of people who do what needs to be done.” For a social movement to create real change, it helps to be skilled at both mobilizing and organizing. But that doesn’t mean that both skills are equally important. Dare was great at mobilizing—the organization collected huge donations, charmed legislators, and spurred hundreds of rallies—but it was largely ineffective at changing how people behaved. Multiple studies showed that some students even reported more drug use than nonparticipants, in part because the curriculum made them curious about experimenting. And, by the early two-thousands, many of the schools that had once been enrolled in Dare had dropped it. The program proved to be more of a fad than a movement.\nmadd, meanwhile, became one of the most successful advocacy groups in the U.S. Today, it has chapters in every state. madd has helped pass more than a thousand state laws, including one in New York, known as Leandra’s Law, that makes it an automatic felony to drive while intoxicated with someone age fifteen or younger in the car. madd was a pioneering advocate for victim-impact panels—namely, for allowing people affected by a crime to describe their experiences—which has become a common part of the criminal-justice system. The story of MADD suggests that organizing is more important than mobilizing.\nOne can look at the maga movement and the Democratic Party through a similar lens. Today’s Democratic Party is great at mobilizing: it can propel people into the streets with big marches, raise billions of dollars for national candidates, and get liberals to bombard congressional offices with letters and phone calls. However, it’s less talented at organizing—building the kinds of local infrastructure and disparate leaders that are needed to sustain a large and ideologically diverse coalition. maga, on the other hand, is great at organizing—after 2020, the movement launched the so-called Precinct Strategy, which encouraged thousands of people to run for leadership positions within their local Republican Party chapters, and to become poll workers. This is a reason Donald Trump is in the White House again—and liberal and conservative activists alike say that it will be hard for the Democrats to start consistently winning until they mimic some of Maga’s strategies.\nFaith & Freedom was launched in direct response to the electoral success of a liberal: Barack Obama. In 2008, after the Democrats’ sweeping victory of the White House and Congress, the longtime Republican operative Ralph Reed began studying exit polls to understand why so many conservatives who wouldn’t have dreamed of voting for Al Gore or John Kerry had supported Obama. Two decades earlier, Reed had been the executive director of the Christian Coalition, which had encouraged religious voters to turn out for conservative candidates. In 1994, the group helped deliver the House of Representatives to Republicans for the first time in forty years. In 2000, the coalition helped George W. Bush win the Presidency with around seventy per cent of the evangelical vote. By then, Reed, sensing more lucrative opportunities, had left the group to become a corporate public-affairs strategist.\nAfter his departure, the Christian Coalition’s influence declined, but evangelicals continued to support Republicans. Then Obama emerged. As Reed examined canvassing records from the 2008 election, he found that Catholic voters, often stable Republicans, had supported Obama rather than the Republican candidate, Senator John McCain, by a nine-point margin. Obama had also outperformed previous Democrats with evangelical voters. Even among voters who attended worship services more than once a week, a reliable Republican bloc, Obama had increased his support by eight points. To Reed, these numbers were terrifying. “If you’ve worked on campaigns as long as I have, you know when a slaughter’s coming,” Reed told me. “It was here.”\nHow had Obama done it? To Reed and other political professionals, the answer seemed rooted, in part, in Obama’s willingness to ignore conventional wisdom about how campaigns ought to be run. Most Presidential races, once the primaries are over, rely on a large, professional staff to organize tens of thousands of volunteers. Although free labor can help a candidate win, volunteers are also seen as a source of risk, best restricted to such drudge work as phone banking or door knocking. Professionals worry that if volunteers are given too much freedom they’re likely to go off script, muddy the message, or spark social-media controversies.\nObama’s campaign, however, took the opposite approach. It recruited tens of thousands of volunteer leaders and basically told them to do what they thought best—in essence, to become franchises. These local leaders began experimenting with different messages and strategies, and then shared their results with one another. In Florida, a volunteer used her own money to rent an unofficial Obama campaign office while others built an “Obama booth,” near a dog run, to register voters. In California, one particularly enthusiastic volunteer created an unofficial social-media account for Obama. (Webmasters eventually took it away.) After the official campaign built a website with instructions on how to create pro-Obama videos, more than four hundred thousand of them were uploaded to YouTube. This deliberately varied strategy vastly exceeded expectations; by many counts, it attracted more volunteers, who worked for more hours, than in any other campaign in U.S. history. In the 2008 and 2012 campaigns, a total of more than two million Obama supporters approached their neighbors and colleagues more than twenty-four million times, registering at least 1.8 million new voters and helping Obama and congressional Democrats secure victories.\nAs Reed saw it, Republicans had clearly been out-organized. In 2009, when he founded the Faith & Freedom Coalition, he adopted the franchise model that had propelled Obama (and madd). For instance, when Chad Schnitger, an organizer based in Riverside, California, asked Faith & Freedom’s headquarters about starting a local chapter, Reed’s lieutenants provided him with their blessing, some literature, and a small financial donation. But he was essentially on his own: he would need to find his own funding, develop his own strategies, and build his own network. Schnitger took advantage of this license and began contacting evangelical pastors and conservative nonprofits throughout Southern California. His pitch wasn’t about elections. “It was that I understand organizing, and I’m a Christian,” he told me. “Pastors want to be politically active—or, at least, to see their values having an impact in politics—but they’re scared they’ll get in trouble,” because churches and nonprofits are generally prohibited by I.R.S. rules from engaging in partisan campaigning. (Those rules changed slightly last year.)\nSchnitger began e-mailing pastors with advice about what they could safely say from the pulpit on topics including school-board elections and tax proposals. He also began publishing regular newsletters with updates on such matters as homeschooling laws. Many parishioners in evangelical churches already belonged to small Bible-study groups—a tactic used by megachurches to help members bond—and Schnitger asked church leaders to nominate volunteers to serve as Faith & Freedom liaisons. “My job is to build up the pastors and then encourage them to push leadership as far down as possible,” Schnitger told me. “I do for them what Faith & Freedom does for me.” When Schnitger ran out of churches to influence, he began approaching gun-club members and homeschooling associations. There wasn’t always ideological overlap among these groups. The people at gun clubs weren’t necessarily churchgoers; some homeschooling groups were wary of guns. “But it doesn’t matter if they agree on everything,” Schnitger said. “They just have to agree on who they’re voting for.”\nSoon, Faith & Freedom had three hundred and fifty thousand members in California. Starting in 2020, after carefully studying the state’s “ballot harvesting” laws, Schnitger concluded that he could place boxes inside hundreds of churches, eventually collecting thousands of ballots each election.\nNationwide, there are 3.1 million Faith & Freedom members, and in 2024 they encouraged neighbors to vote for Trump nearly eighty million times—an outreach three times larger than Obama’s record-setting effort. The group’s headquarters distributes money, as well as write-ups about the results of local experiments, to the various chapters. But it’s up to local volunteers to decide which tactics to adopt and which issues to champion, as long as they align with the group’s basic conservative values.\nIf there’s a formula to Faith & Freedom’s success, Schnitger told me, “it’s basically just being around—that’s our whole secret. Instead of showing up at election time and asking for votes, we’re here year-round, asking people what they need.” Schnitger is selling community. “The election is just the by-product,” he said.\nThis kind of organizing is hardly the only reason that Trump won. But scholars who study both parties agree that in recent decades Republicans have created broad ideological coalitions—something that Democrats, who tend to have litmus tests on abortion, social justice, and numerous other topics, have often not achieved. Conservatives have also built a media ecosystem that dwarfs Democratic messaging. Sarah Longwell, a longtime conservative strategist, opposes Trump’s autocratic transformation of the Republican Party, but she told me that the maga movement has nevertheless “done a fantastic job of welcoming anyone who puts on the red hat. That’s the only requirement—you just have to think Trump is great.”\nKirk often spouted toxic right-wing rhetoric, including anti-gay and Islamophobic views, as well as antisemitic conspiracy theories. And a national field director of Turning Point resigned after it was revealed that she had declared, “I HATE BLACK PEOPLE! Like fuck them all.” But Kirk, at so-called Prove Me Wrong campus rallies across the nation, made a point of engaging with anyone who wanted to debate. When a gay student approached the microphone at a large Turning Point rally at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, Kirk said that he didn’t approve of the student’s “life style,” but he added that, if they could agree on, say, closing the border, then “we welcome you to the conservative movement.” At another event, he said to a liberal student who had been invited to speak, “You know how we heal our divides? By talking to people we disagree with.” In September, Kirk was assassinated in front of three thousand students at Utah Valley University while debating a liberal audience member about gun control.\nColby Kelley, a former Turning Point leader at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, told me that the group’s ethos and loose organizational structure had pushed him to interact with all kinds of people he wouldn’t normally speak to, including socialists, anarchists, and attractive women. (He met his girlfriend at a Turning Point meeting.) “It kind of teaches you to talk to everyone, because you never know who you’re going to agree with,” he said. “Just because we argue doesn’t mean we have to dislike each other.” Of course, the liberals Kelley has engaged with may not have found these exchanges as satisfying as he did—some of his interlocutors may have been offended. But Kirk’s Prove Me Wrong aesthetic was never about making liberals comfortable or converting them into Trump voters. Rather, it was about reassuring conservatives, of all kinds, that they could find a place within Turning Point USA.\nAs the effort became increasingly professionalized, its infrastructure began coming apart. Some activists objected to the event’s name, given its similarity to previous marches, including the incendiary Million Man March of 1995, which had been led by Louis Farrakhan of the Nation of Islam. The anti-Trump gathering was quickly rechristened the Women’s March, but soon afterward national organizers began issuing rules that struck some members as exclusionary. For one thing, women’s organizations that were anti-abortion were prohibited from participating. For another, participants who questioned some diversity-and-inclusion initiatives were not welcomed. Internal debates erupted about whether sex workers should be celebrated or seen as victims, and about the role of Jews in propagating racism. Shook distanced herself from the effort and called for the co-chairs to step down. These and other leaders bickered among themselves, accusing one another of racism and antisemitism. The turnout was impressive for the march itself. But, after, many of the groups created to put it on fell into factional infighting or drifted apart.\nIn the past century, Democrats have usually counted on outside organizations such as churches and labor unions to provide the kind of year-round, localized infrastructure that a movement needs to survive. But, as unions and non-evangelical churches have shrunk, the left has turned to a different strategy. It’s become largely focussed on creating spectacles, such as the No Kings protests, that can mobilize large numbers of people at breakneck speed to march, sign petitions, and contribute money. But much of the energy fizzles away once the protest or the election is over. Indeed, large gatherings and high-profile protests haven’t generally been effective at sparking widespread change: a recent study from the National Bureau of Economic Research, which looked at major U.S. social movements between 2017 and 2022, found that “protests generate substantial internet activity but have limited effects on political attitudes.” The researchers studied activism connected to the environment, gender equality, gun control, immigration, and other issues. Except for the myriad protests following the death of George Floyd, which may have slightly increased votes for Democrats, the researchers estimated “null effects of protests on public opinion and electoral behavior.”\nAccording to Hahrie Han, the Johns Hopkins professor, part of the issue with modern progressive organizing is that “digital tools allow groups to scale really fast, but it also creates incentives to shortcut building infrastructure.” To take a far-off example, she said, during the Arab Spring, Twitter rallied people to topple dictators, “but the military was in power pretty soon afterward, because there wasn’t an infrastructure to sustain and channel that outrage.” Unlike at madd, where chapters were forced to build local communities and the dysfunction at headquarters allowed grassroots leaders to fill power vacuums, events like the Women’s March are usually national in focus, vacuums are filled by professional organizers, and strong local leaders seldom rise to top positions.\nEven some of the most sophisticated left-leaning groups have stumbled. Following Trump’s victory in 2016, a group of former congressional staffers inspired by the pugnacity of Tea Party conservatives posted a rousing twenty-three-page online pamphlet titled “Indivisible: A Practical Guide for Resisting the Trump Agenda,” which encouraged such tactics as setting up Google News alerts for local congresspeople and spreading out at town halls to create the perception of broad support. The group also created a Google Doc to help activists across the country find one another. As with Dare, the initiative was quickly embraced by big donors and national leaders. In its first year, the group raised $2.6 million. Within two months, there were thousands of Indivisible chapters.\nBut, unlike the Tea Party, which at its founding was a chaotic jumble of anti-government viewpoints and competing leadership claims, Indivisible was tightly guided by its D.C. leaders and their dozens of employees. Tea Party activists often took the initiative to run in local races for school boards or county commissions; Indivisible’s headquarters focussed mostly on national issues and federal elections. The group’s national office scored some successes: it organized demonstrations against Trump’s Cabinet nominees and protested Republican attempts to repeal Obamacare. Yet there were structural problems. Initially, the group was a place for like-minded activists in numerous cities to convene, and various chapters started having success at backing local candidates. But organizational tensions emerged among Indivisible’s headquarters—staffed by young political professionals who pushed for Medicare for All, the Green New Deal, and Elizabeth Warren’s candidacy for President—and many state volunteers, who, a 2021 study found, were largely “older white women” who didn’t necessarily agree with those stances and “worked very hard to boost Democrats they understood held more moderate views.”\nThe author of that study, Theda Skocpol, a political scientist at Harvard, told me that Indivisible represents “a tragic lost opportunity.” Local grassroots Indivisible groups were “very impactful on people running for office and winning,” she said, and they “operated pretty much on their own.” But the group’s top leaders, instead of building a sustainable and ideologically diverse membership, focussed on high-profile protests—and on maintaining ideological unity. At one point, the Indivisible headquarters discouraged chapters from endorsing candidates who were pro-life, or didn’t support gender-affirming care, or questioned making it easier for people to register to vote.\nIn her study, Skocpol wrote that, “since 2017, national Indivisible leaders have raised tens of millions of dollars from major donors, but have not devolved significant resources away from Washington, D.C., to empower democratically accountable state and local leaders. Instead, Indivisible directors have invested most of their resources into running a large, professionally staffed, national advocacy organization.” (Indivisible disputes Skocpol’s assessment and sent me a statement saying that it has “enthusiastically campaigned for Democrats across the political spectrum.”)\nSkocpol went on, “If progressive-minded Americans want real change, most of the expertise, money and time we can muster should stop flowing into national advocacy bureaucracies engaged in symbolic maneuvers and purist politics.”\nOne problem, according to researchers, is that the left’s success in mobilizing large crowds may have caused leaders to misunderstand what spurs someone to become politically active in the first place. In the late nineties, the sociologist Ziad Munson began interviewing pro-life advocates, and he initially assumed that such people had been strongly opposed to abortion for years. “I was completely wrong,” he said. In fact, nearly a quarter of activists told him that they had been pro-choice when they attended their first pro-life event. A majority said that they had not had strong opinions about abortion. “But then something happened, like they moved to a new town or started going to a new church, or they got divorced and started joining singles groups, and the new people they met were pro-life,” Munson explained. “And so they found a community, and a sense of identity, and that’s when they became committed.”\nMany leaders of local MADD chapters first sought the group out after their lives had been upended by a drunk driver, and they found that meeting other victims helped them process their anger and grief. Wolfson, the madd researcher, told me, “They were mainly women who had never thought of themselves as public figures, and now they’re talking to legislators and spending time with people who understand them and making new friends. At that point, you’re all in.” The organization accepted everyone, regardless of ideological background (and drinking habits). “All you needed to join was to care about this issue.”\nWhen researchers such as Munson look at today’s leftist movements, they often see the opposite approach. “The left has purity tests,” Munson said. “You have to prove you’re devoted to the cause. But that means that, once you join, you’re spending time with the kind of people you already know, because you already move in the same circles, and you’ve screened out people who might be ideologically ambivalent right now but might have become activists if you had welcomed them.”\nAt pride marches in Chicago, New York, and Washington, D.C., organizers have refused or ejected participants because they were carrying rainbow flags with a Star of David. At a Cincinnati anti-white-supremacy rally, a rabbi was prohibited from speaking because, organizers said, “allowing Zionists to participate undermines the original goal of the demonstration,” despite the rabbi’s vocal criticisms of the Israeli government. People have been excluded for other reasons: at Evergreen State College, in Olympia, Washington, an event called a Day of Absence, featuring discussions about racism, was cancelled after organizers asked white people to stay away from campus.\nThe sociologist Liz McKenna, of Harvard, told me that movements succeed best when people feel welcome. A movement becomes sustainable when members feel empowered and find friends. “The left loves big protests, but protesting is a tactic in search of a strategy,” she said. There must be some shared core values among a movement’s members, of course, but the requirement can’t be that every value is shared. “Making room for difference isn’t a nice-to-have thing—it’s table stakes,” she told me. “The rallies are by-products of the community, not the goal.” Most of all, even though anger can be useful, a movement also needs to provide some joy. “Trump rallies are fun,” McKenna noted. “The Turning Point campus debates are fun.” For a long time, she said, the left was less fun and more angry, “and so the right was out-organizing them at every turn.”\nCaldwell had a college degree and had been a professional her entire life. But now, as a convicted criminal, she couldn’t even get a job at a fast-food restaurant. When she saw a Facebook post mentioning that a new group was looking for people to organize rural communities, she signed up. An organizer told her that “they needed people to interview farmers and politicians,” Caldwell said. “And I was, like, ‘You want a Black woman, and a convict, to get white people in Alamance to open up? Good luck!’ ”\nThe group, Down Home North Carolina, had been created by Todd Zimmer after the state’s Republican legislators voted to refuse federal Medicaid funds. “That money would have helped people see doctors,” Zimmer told me. “But they wanted to send a message about Democratic overspending.” Zimmer holds fairly liberal views, at least on national issues. “But, in rural areas, people are thinking about their neighborhood school, and whether the hospitals will stay open, and how much groceries cost,” he said. Most of North Carolina’s left-leaning organizations were focussed on big cities such as nearby Durham, where Democrats outnumber Republicans four to one. Zimmer figured that, if he could build a coalition of voters—both progressives and right-wingers—who might not agree on national candidates but were aligned on local issues, they could become one of the most powerful blocs in the state. “You can’t pass a bill in North Carolina without rural places,” he said. “That’s a fact. And so, if those places get organized, that’s where the power is.”\nZimmer’s strategy was to send people like Caldwell into parking lots at Walmart and Dollar General to ask residents what might spark them to action. The interviewees didn’t mention trans rights, Jeffrey Epstein, or other issues that were mainstays of cable news. Instead, they expressed worries about getting Narcan for relatives, where to bring vulnerable neighbors when summer temperatures spiked, and how to find affordable child care. Some complained about getting trapped in the same cash-bail system that had ensnared Caldwell. “And then we would ask them if they wanted to start a Down Home chapter in their city,” Zimmer said. “We’d give them training and encouragement, but, beyond that, it was really up to them.” The goal was to be akin to a church, “where everyone’s welcome, and we talk about important things, but it’s up to you to choose your path.”\nCaldwell and her colleagues began working on various campaigns, such as helping residents of the town of Oxford successfully lobby for the renovation of a derelict basketball court. Throughout North Carolina, Down Home offered locals advice on how to communicate with government officials and notes on how to speak at meetings. As Down Home spread, sometimes as many as two hundred members would show up at a county-commission meeting. When they took to the microphone, some of them would start talking about space aliens or chemtrails. “But that’s O.K.,” Zimmer said. “Because then they talk about wanting to see a new stop sign, because their cousin—whom the commissioners probably went to school with—almost got run over last month.”\nDown Home now has fourteen chapters. The group has been credited with helping elect enough Democrats to the state House to prevent Republicans from amassing a veto-proof supermajority. In 2023, despite Republican control of the state legislature, North Carolina lawmakers voted to expand Medicaid in the state and passed a slew of other pro-rural bills supported by Down Home. Caldwell, who is now the organization’s executive co-director, told me, “If you polled our members, you might find they’re voting for very different people for President. But for the local soil-and-water board, or school board, we’re pretty aligned. That’s all we need.”\nIn Minnesota, an organization named ISAIAH has built a coalition of Black churches, Islamic centers, child-care providers, East African immigrants, and college students. The goal is to “spend time together in common areas” and to “build power for a multiracial democracy, caring economy, and thriving planet” by forging alliances among groups that are otherwise unlikely to encounter one another. In 2023, even though the state legislature was divided, ISAIAH successfully lobbied for one of the most generous paid family- and medical-leave bills in the nation. The group’s recently departed executive director, Doran Schrantz, told me that one reason the group has thrived is that it doesn’t limit participation to people who can pass litmus tests on such issues as abortion or L.G.B.T.Q. rights. Exclusionary tactics “are kryptonite,” she told me. “We’re focussed on bread-and-butter issues that people agree on, regardless of party.”\nIn southern Indiana, a group named Hoosier Action has organized rural voters who pushed through legislation providing for the largest investment in mental health in the state’s history. Kate Hess Pace, the group’s executive director, told me that, when members meet with candidates, “it’s really clear how disconnected the Democratic Party is from working-class people.” The bluest cities are often the most expensive places to live, she said, and, “when our members tell stories about overdose and addiction, the Dem candidates immediately go to policy solutions. It’s like they’re incapable of meeting people emotionally. It’s the Republicans who consistently say, ‘Oh, yeah, my brother’s been in and out of rehab, I understand how much that hurts.’ ”\nDown Home North Carolina, ISAIAH, and Hoosier Action have proved effective at increasing voter turnout for issues traditionally associated with the left. But donations from progressive groups have only rarely flowed their way. For the 2024 Presidential election, national Democrats spent $2.9 billion trying to elect Kamala Harris, in one of the most expensive campaigns in history. (Republicans spent $1.8 billion supporting Trump.) By contrast, Down Home North Carolina, ISAIAH, and Hoosier Action collectively raised just thirteen million dollars in 2024, much of it from local donors. Sarah Jaynes, the director of the Rural Democracy Initiative, a group that directs grants to local advocacy organizations, told me that “the Harris campaign and these big Senate races had more money than they could use—but the groups on the ground who know people, the trusted messengers, they’re basically ignored.”\nThe solution, activists such as Wikler and Zimmer believe, is to reprioritize where Democratic funds and attention are spent. The successful mayoral campaign of Zohran Mamdani, the Harvard researcher Liz McKenna notes, “was by all accounts joyful, hopeful, creative, and reflected a real sense of collective possibility. And that emotional culture translated into a major electoral upset.” Nationally, however, there are few Democratic candidates running similar campaigns. And, when it comes to emotions, Trump seems to spark stronger feelings, on both the left and the right, than anyone else.\nRalph Reed reminded me that, for Faith & Freedom and many similar conservative organizations, there are no showy national rallies. And there’s little strictness about ideological consistency. But during elections the group turns out millions of voters. When Reed looks at the left today, he said, “a lot of times it feels like they’re trying to hook people with big parades and free Beyoncé concerts.” That’s not how you win, he went on. “You win by offering people a set of values that give them meaning. Celebrities don’t deliver that. Small groups of neighbors do. And, as long as we’re building those groups, we’re gonna win.” ♦","summary":"Republicans have become adept at creating broad coalitions in which supporting Trump is the only requirement.

Michael McCaul of Texas and Sens. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, pressed for more information. Their statements, in addition to concern expressed from several Republican governors, reflected a party struggling with how to respond to Saturday’s fatal shooting of Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care nurse at a VA hospital.\n\nTrump administration officials were quick to cast Pretti as the instigator. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was among those who said Pretti “approached” immigration officers with a gun and acted violently. Videos from the scene show Pretti being pushed by an officer and then a half-dozen agents descend on him. During the scuffle, he is holding a phone but is never seen brandishing the 9mm semiautomatic handgun police say he was licensed to carry.\n\nThe killing has raised uncomfortable questions about the GOP’s core positions on issues ranging from gun ownership to states’ rights and trust in the federal government.\n\nCassidy, who is facing a Trump-backed challenger in his reelection bid, said on social media that the shooting was “incredibly disturbing” and that the “credibility of ICE and DHS are at stake.” He pushed for “a full joint federal and state investigation.” Tillis, who is not seeking reelection, urged a “thorough and impartial investigation” and said “any administration official who rushes to judgment and tries to shut down an investigation before it begins are doing an incredible disservice to the nation and to President Trump’s legacy.”\n\nMurkowski called for an investigation and added that “ICE agents do not have carte blanche in carrying out their duties.” Collins, the only incumbent Republican senator facing reelection in a state Democrat Kamala Harris carried in 2024, said a probe is needed “to determine whether or not excessive force was used in a situation that may have been able to be diffused without violence.”\n\nWhile calling for protesters to “keep space” from law enforcement and not interfere, Collins said federal law enforcement must “recognize both the public’s right to protest and the highly charged situation they now face.”\n\nEven Sen. Pete Ricketts, a staunch ally of President Donald Trump, called for a “prioritized, transparent investigation.”\n\n“My support for funding ICE remains the same,” the Nebraska Republican, who is up for reelection, said online. “But we must also maintain our core values as a nation, including the right to protest and assemble.”\n\nTrump and other administration officials remained firm in their defense of the hard-line immigration enforcement tactics in Minneapolis, blaming Democrats in the state along with local law enforcement for not working with them. Many Republicans either echoed that sentiment or stayed silent.\n\nIn a lengthy social media post on Sunday evening, Trump called on Minnesota’s Democratic leadership to “formally cooperate” with his administration and pressed Congress to ban so-called sanctuary cities.\n\nThe White House will likely face at least some GOP pushback\n\nTrump has enjoyed nearly complete loyalty from fellow Republicans during his first year back in the White House. But the positions staked out in the wake of the shooting signal the administration will face at least some pushback within the party in its swift effort to define Pretti, who protested Trump’s immigration crackdown, as a violent demonstrator.\n\nDeputy White House chief of staff Stephen Miller issued social media posts referencing an “assassin” and “domestic terrorist” while Noem said Pretti showed up to “impede a law enforcement operation.”\n\nAt a minimum, some Republicans are calling for a de-escalation in Minneapolis.\n\nOklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt told CNN’s “State of the Union” that the shooting was a “real tragedy” and Trump needs to define an “end game.”\n\n“Nobody likes the feds coming to their states,” Stitt said. “And so what is the goal right now? Is it to deport every single non-U.S. citizen? I don’t think that’s what Americans want.”\n\nVermont Gov. Phil Scott said the shooting was “not acceptable.”\n\n“At best, these federal immigration operations are a complete failure of coordination of acceptable public safety and law enforcement practices, training and leadership,” he said in a post. “At worst, it’s deliberate federal intimidation and incitement of American citizens.”\n\nEchoing criticism that local law enforcement isn’t cooperating with federal officials, Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., suggested the administration focus its immigration efforts elsewhere.\n\n“If I were President Trump, I would almost think about if the mayor and the governor are going to put our ICE officials in harm’s way and there’s a chance of losing more innocent lives or whatever, then maybe go to another city and let the people of Minneapolis decide do we want to continue to have all these illegals?” he told “Sunday Morning Futures” on the Fox News Channel. “I think the people of Minnesota would rebel against their leadership.”\n\nA sensitive moment for the GOP\n\nPretti’s killing comes at a sensitive moment for the GOP as the party prepares for a challenging midterm election year. Trump has fomented a sense of chaos on the world stage, bringing the NATO alliance to the brink last week. Domestically, Trump has struggled to respond to widespread affordability concerns.\n\nMeanwhile, approval of his handling of immigration — long a political asset for the president and the GOP — has tumbled. Just 38% of U.S. adults approved of how Trump was handling immigration in January, down from 49% in March, according to an AP-NORC poll.\n\nThe killing spurred notable tension with the GOP’s long-standing support for gun rights. Officials say Pretti was armed, but no bystander videos that have surfaced so far appear to show him holding a weapon. The Minneapolis police chief said Pretti had a permit to carry a gun.\n\nYet administration officials, including Noem and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have questioned why he was armed. Speaking on ABC’s “This Week” Bessent said that when he has attended protests, “I didn’t bring a gun. I brought a billboard.”\n\nSuch comments were notable for a party where support for the Second Amendment’s protection of gun ownership is foundational. Indeed, many in the GOP, including Trump, lifted Kyle Rittenhouse into prominence when the then-17-year-old former police youth cadet shot three men, killing two of them, during a 2020 protest in Wisconsin against police brutality. He was acquitted of all charges after testifying that he acted in self defense.\n\nIn the wake of Pretti’s killing, gun rights advocates noted that it is legal to carry firearms during protests.\n\n“Every peaceable Minnesotan has the right to keep and bear arms — including while attending protests, acting as observers, or exercising their First Amendment rights,” the Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus said in a statement. “These rights do not disappear when someone is lawfully armed.”\n\nIn a social media post, the National Rifle Association said “responsible public voices should be awaiting a full investigation, not making generalizations and demonizing law-abiding citizens.”\n\nRep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., who is often critical of the White House, said “carrying a firearm is not a death sentence.”\n\n“It’s a Constitutionally protected God-given right,” he said, “and if you don’t understand this you have no business in law enforcement or government.\n\nThe second-ranking Justice Department official said he was aware of reports that Pretti was lawfully armed.\n\n“There’s nothing wrong with anybody lawfully carrying firearms,” Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said on “Meet the Press” on NBC. “But just make no mistake about it, this was an incredibly split-second decision that had to be made by ICE officers.”","summary":"The Trump administration accused a VA nurse of instigating the shooting.","url":"https://www.syracuse.com/us-news/2026/01/republican-calls-growing-for-deeper-investigation-into-fatal-minneapolis-shooting.html","image":"https://www.syracuse.com/resizer/v2/35ZAWZRGPJHCNJDSLUI6WBN2KE.jpg?auth=8440e12b8d7fabbaf9eb6caecb51034d7cc2d73f32dd3b6bbc60ac945e36c55f&width=1280&smart=true&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-26 10:12:48","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.135},{"id":396173876,"title":"Trump’s bounce among Hispanics can benefit him in the midterm elections ","text":"One explanation is that Hispanics enthusiastically support the Trump administration’s recent capture of Venezuela’s tyrant, Nicolas Maduro. A new Morning Consult poll found that 66% of Hispanics supported the move, the highest level of approval of any racial group. White people, for example, supported the president’s decision at 64%. The triumphant military operation saw elite U.S. commandos dive into the heart of a foreign country and snatch a dictator and enemy of America without suffering a single loss. It’s no surprise that such an exhibition of strength and competence would play well with voters.\n\nThe public has become increasingly skeptical of foreign interventions in recent years, but they like to win. Hispanic people are no exception.\n\nTrump’s efforts to secure the border and crack down on drug trafficking and violent crime have also received favorable support in this demographic group. Under the Biden administration, America’s southern border became a playground for narcoterrorist organizations, with predictable results. Americans of all ethnicities became less safe as their communities deteriorated. \n\nTrump has restored sovereignty, worked to seal the border, and taken the fight to the doorstep of those who peddle the poison that kills thousands of Americans. The status quo was neither working nor sustainable, and the public knew it.\n\nUnsurprisingly, a majority supports securing the border. So, too, do the Hispanic voters who have played a key role in Trump’s political fortunes. \n\nIn 2024, Trump received a record share of their votes at 43%. While not as high as his Democratic opponent, Kamala Harris, this is a higher percentage than any Republican candidate in modern history, and an 8-point increase from 2020. It could be the start of something big for Trump and the Republican Party, possibly giving both a needed boost as they look ahead to a difficult midterm.\n\nFor decades, the Republican Party has sought to attract Latinos and other minority voters who had long been part of the Democratic coalition. George W. Bush, for example, made a concerted effort to bring Hispanics into the tent, seeking to use immigration reform and other measures to do so. Trump’s approach has been altogether different. \n\nWHITE HOUSE REPORT CARD: FOREIGN SUCCESSES AND SABER-RATTLING OVER GREENLAND\n\nHe has sought to remake the Republican Party as the champion of the working class, willing to address the “root cause” of illegal immigration. This has been key to winning over voters whom the Democratic Party took for granted. \n\nBringing them into the GOP alone won’t be enough to bring the party victoriously across the finish line. Its fate will hinge on the economy and prices, as voters will hold the ruling party accountable. But Trump’s rebalancing of relations with Latin America, which includes toppling Maduro and deporting illegal immigrants who taint legal immigrants, can be an element in winning Hispanic votes next November. If Trump can lower the cost of living, he will likely hold his gains among Hispanics.","summary":"It has recently been a bad stretch for President Donald Trump, perhaps the worst of his second term.

Along with its usual tributes to excellence in film and television, this year's Golden Globes ceremony expanded for the first time into the audio space via its newest category, Best Podcast.\n\nIn case you missed it, \"Good Hang with Amy Poehler\" claimed that inaugural award, cementing the not-even-a-year-old series as a formidable player in the entertainment world. This historic win highlights a broader trend: podcasts are no longer just a side project for stars, but a primary destination for raw interviews and cultural commentary.\n\nAlong with Poehler's award-winning show, here are five great pop culture podcasts you should add to your rotation.\n\n'Good Hang with Amy Poehler'\n\nAmy Poehler, the beloved comedienne from \"Saturday Night Live,\" \"Parks and Recreation\" and funny flicks like \"Mean Girls,\" \"Baby Mama\" and the \"Inside Out\" franchise, launched her sweet interview series \"Good Hang\" in March 2025, inviting close pals — who just happen to be some of Hollywood's biggest comedic power players — like Tina Fey, Martin Short, Jack Black and Kathryn Hahn to appear in the show's early episodes.\n\nIn the past year, Poehler has expanded that subject pool to politics (Michelle Obama), cooking (Ina Garten), music (The Jonas Brothers), directing (Ryan Coogler) and more, but through it all, the lighthearted yet insightful format has remained, with engaging sit-downs about her interviewee's professional wit.\n\n\"Good Hang with Amy Poehler\" on Spotify\n\n'SmartLess'\n\nThere's not one but three big-name celebrities at the helm of \"SmartLess\": actors and longtime buddies Jason Bateman, Sean Hayes and Will Arnett. Every week since the show debuted on July 20, 2020, one of the fellas invites a surprise celebrity guest to the program and reveals their identity at the top of the episode to the other two hosts before kicking off their characteristically disarming and humorous conversations about personal life, professional career and more.\n\n“We don’t have any format, there’s no preamble,” Arnett declared during a 2021 installment of the show. There’s no theme, there’s no goal. I’ve been winging it since 1970, why would I start now?\"\n\nThe trio had produced more than 300 episodes over the past half-decade, with illustrious interviewees like George Clooney, Kamala Harris, Paul McCartney, Jennifer Aniston, Steven Spielberg, Billie Eilish and more.\n\n\"SmartLess\" on Apple Podcasts\n\n'The Basement Yard'\n\n\"The Basement Yard\" differs from other pop culture podcasts on this list as its hosts aren't of the traditional celebrity mold — rather, the weekly comedy podcast is emceed by YouTube vlogger Joe Santagato and his childhood BFF Frank Alvarez — and it's less of an interview show and more a chance for the two lifelong friends to engage with pop culture through viral clips, spirited debates, nostalgic discussions and other funny segments.\n\nThe podcast has grown and shifted in the decade since Santagato first started it as a solo show. Its most recent iteration was a live tour that sold out notable venues like Madison Square Garden and Radio City Music Hall in their native New York City.\n\n\"The Basement Yard\" on Apple Podcasts\n\n\"Call Her Daddy\"\n\nAlex Cooper has become podcast powerhouse via \"Call Her Daddy,\" the Golden Globe-nominated sex, relationship and entertainment series she launched in 2018 with then-co-host Sofia Franklyn. Franklyn departed the project in 2020, prior to Cooper's $60 million deal to exclusively present the podcast on Spotify in 2021, which she more than doubled in a $125 million distribution and advertising deal with Sirius XM three years later.\n\nVia her raw, unfiltered discussions with celebrities like Kim Kardashian, Miley Cyrus, Gwyneth Paltrow, Charlize Theron and Chappell Roan, among many others, Cooper's podcast manages to get intimate insights into these mega-stars' personal lives, delving into everything from toxic relationships to sexual identity to mental health struggles and more.\n\n\"Call Her Daddy\" on SiriusXM\n\n'Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend'\n\nThanks to his lengthy late-night career, Conan O'Brien certainly knows how to conduct a fun interview with a celebrity guest, but his weekly podcast \"Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend\" allows him to get \"deeper, unboundedly playful, and free from FCC regulations\" in trying to establish \"real and lasting friendship\" with his famous subjects.\n\nCo-hosted by O'Brien's longtime assistant-turned-friend Sona Movsesian and producer Matt Gourley, the podcast has seen Conan pal around with Matt Damon, Ben Stiller, Rose Byrne, Janelle James, Ted Danson, Leanne Morgan and Will Ferrell, his first-ever guest when the series premiered back in 2018.\n\n\"Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend\" on Spotify\n\nFollow Tom's Guide on Google News and add us as a preferred source to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds. \n\nMore from Tom's Guide\n\nBest wireless earbuds 2026 — tested and ratedI've spent 300 hours testing the best portable Bluetooth speakers — these are the 11 that are worth your moneyHidden AirPods features — 5 things you didn't know your Apple earbuds could do","summary":"I could listen to these 5 pop culture podcasts all day long — and one just made Golden Globes history.","url":"https://www.tomsguide.com/entertainment/im-obsessed-with-these-5-pop-culture-podcasts-and-one-just-won-a-golden-globe","image":"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oFzcbGDgpfojpzyA5BCtMf-2000-80.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-26 10:00:00","author":"Christina Izzo","authors":["Christina Izzo"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.607},{"id":396183946,"title":"Two comedians told the truth about Jasmine Crockett's campaign","text":"This month, some of the worst elements of 2020-style online progressive politics made a brief return, thanks to a controversy involving a couple of comedians and U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett of Texas. It merits attention, despite its seeming triviality, because the underlying issue could cost Democrats the Senate this fall.\n\nThe contretemps started with an offhand comment on “Las Culturistas,” a podcast hosted by actors and comedians Bowen Yang, until recently a star on “Saturday Night Live,” and Matt Rogers. Rogers was dunking on Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, arguing that Democrats need genuinely populist leaders, not those who simply excel at trolling Donald Trump. From there, he dismissed Crockett’s campaign to move up to the Senate.\n\n“Anytime a politician is making it too obviously about themselves, I’m already done,” he said. “And don’t waste your money sending to Jasmine Crockett. Do not do it.” Yang added, “I must agree.”\n\nOnline, there was a backlash from Crockett fans, many of whom accused the “Las Culturistas” hosts of racism and misogyny. The reaction was intense enough that both Rogers and Yang issued abject apologies. “I have great respect and admiration for Rep. Crockett,” wrote Rogers, who promised to “be better.” Yang pledged to use his platform “more responsibly.”\n\nBut Rogers and Yang were right to be skeptical of Crockett, who almost certainly cannot win a general election in Texas. Those who disagree have every right to criticize them, and me. But progressives shouldn’t let a retrograde style of internet discourse inhibit them from pointing out the obvious.\n\nIt can be tricky, of course, to discuss electability concerns about Black women candidates. It’s not always easy to draw the line between analyzing the voters’ putative prejudices and reifying them. If liberals decide in advance that Black women are at an electoral disadvantage, they risk making that disadvantage real. But it’s not race and gender that make Crockett a bad candidate, though both obviously shape perceptions of her. The problem with Crockett is that her theory about how Democrats can win Texas is wrong.\n\nI understand why lots of Democrats adore Crockett. She’s charismatic and often funny and knows how to command attention. “I think that we have to take a page or two, or three or four, out of Donald Trump’s book,” she told Vanity Fair in 2024. Some of her insults are in bad taste — she has called Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who uses a wheelchair, “Hot Wheels” — but it’s easy to see why Democrats who feel brutalized by Trump want champions willing to go low.\n\nStill, Democrats cannot win Texas, a state where Trump beat Kamala Harris by almost 14 percentage points, without flipping at least some Republican voters. James Talarico, Crockett’s opponent in the Democratic primary, showed that he could do that in his 2018 election to the Texas House, turning a red seat blue and winning a district that was also carried by Abbott.\n\nCrockett, by contrast, has always represented a deep blue district and has never had to run a seriously contested general election.\n\nShe has been openly contemptuous not just of Trump, but also of the Texans who cast their ballots for him. In that Vanity Fair interview, she described Latino voters who agreed with Trump’s pitch on immigration — a demographic where Democrats need to make inroads — as having a “slave mentality.”\n\nRather than focusing on peeling off Trump voters, Crockett is staking her candidacy on a promise to motivate Texans who rarely if ever go to the polls. “The theory of my case has always been that we could expand the electorate,” she told a Texas news station last month. “We could get people that normally don’t participate in politics to be excited about getting involved.”\n\nThis theory is dubious. In a detailed article last month, Texas Monthly called the idea that Democrats can prevail in the state simply by juicing turnout “the biggest lie in Texas politics.” It noted that in 2018, when Beto O’Rourke came close to defeating Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, he did so by winning over hundreds of thousands of Abbott voters who split their tickets. In that year’s midterms, races across the country saw presidential-level turnout. But much of the reason there was a blue wave, according to Democratic data firm Catalist, was that swing voters who’d opted for Trump in 2016 then supported Democrats two years later.\n\nOf course, some candidates have succeeded in part by inspiring low-propensity voters, most notably Trump and New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani. Both were outsider candidates who were able to motivate people who distrust conventional politicians. Crockett, however, isn’t offering an alternative to the Democratic Party’s status quo.\n\nIn Vanity Fair, she described Harris as a “perfect candidate” who “did everything right” and whose main flaw was a failure to get her message across. The video announcing Crockett’s candidacy featured a close-up of her face with audio of Trump insulting her. Trump’s disdain is indeed a badge of honor, but it is probably not enough to activate voters who couldn’t be bothered to vote against him when he was on the ballot.\n\nTexas is a difficult environment for Democrats, but there are a lot of disaffected Trump voters in the state; according to the Texas Politics Project, the president’s approval ratings are underwater there by 7 percentage points. Crockett, however, is poorly positioned to pick up Trump defectors. In November, 49 percent of Texas voters told pollsters they would definitely not vote for her. Only 40 percent said that of Talarico.\n\nSuch numbers may explain why Republicans, according to the political news site NOTUS, worked behind the scenes to push Crockett into the race. The National Republican Senatorial Committee disseminated polls showing her winning a potential primary. Further, an anonymous source told NOTUS, Republicans ran an AstroTurf phone and text campaign urging Democrats to contact Crockett and ask her to run. Those efforts may have worked. “The more I saw the poll results, I couldn’t ignore the trends which were clear,” Crockett said in her announcement speech.\n\nSpeaking to The Washington Post this week, Crockett seemed to suggest that the race was such a long shot that Democrats could afford to take chances. Addressing her critics, she said: “If you think it’s a losing cause, then who cares? But at least you could say we tried something new and we learned something from this experience.”\n\nThis gets things backward. Texas is not a lost cause, and Democrats cannot afford to treat it like one, given that they must flip four Republican seats if they are to retake the Senate.\n\nIf people hesitate to make the case against Crockett because they fear online pile-ons, only Republicans benefit. There is very little that’s good to say about Elon Musk’s transformation of Twitter into a white nationalist propaganda factory, but one tiny silver lining is that it has lessened the platform’s malign influence on progressive politics. As Politico reported this week, now Republicans are the ones dealing with the site’s toxic dynamics, as esoteric debates and influencer feuds tear at the MAGA movement.\n\nBut social media is much bigger than X, and the “Las Culturistas” episode shows that bad-faith social justice arguments still have a lot of power on the internet. The fault for this lies not with the people making those arguments, but with those who let themselves be cowed by them.","summary":"This month, some of the worst elements of 2020-style online progressive politics made a brief return, thanks to a controversy involving a couple of comedians and U.S. Rep.

The victims are the border patrol agents.\n\n\"I’m not blaming the border patrol agents, the victims are the border patrol agents.\n\n\"The suspect put himself in that situation, the victims are the border patrol agents.\"\n\nWarning: Video contains distressing material\n\nAsked what evidence he had to back up the claim that he made on Saturday in which he said Mr Pretti intended to massacre law enforcement officers, Mr Bovino said: \"I believe that the fantastic training that our law enforcement partners have, the fact that they’re highly trained, prevented any specific shooting of law enforcement.\n\n\"So, good job for our law enforcement taking him down before he was able to do that.\"\n\nVideos taken by people at the scene appear to show a federal agent taking a handgun from Mr Pretti’s waistband and walking away.\n\nAs he does so, the first shot is heard. The implication is that the law enforcement officers shot an unarmed man on the ground.\n\nMr Bovino said: \"You don’t know he was unarmed. I don't know he was unarmed.\n\n\"That's freeze frame adjudication of a crime scene via a photo.\n\n\"That's why we have an investigation that is going to answer those questions.\"\n\nHe had no clear answer when asked to point out where and when Mr Pretti \"brandished a gun\" at officers – which Ms Noem alleged.\n\nMr Bovino was asked about Mr Pretti’s Second Amendment rights to \"keep and bear arms\" alongside the fact that he was licensed to own and carry a firearm in the state of Minnesota, which is an open carry state.\n\nHe responded: \"Those rights don't count when you riot and assault, delay and obstruct, impede law enforcement officers, and most especially when you meant to do that beforehand.\"\n\nTo the presenter, he said: \"What you’re saying about the Second Amendment is peacefully protesting with firearms.\n\n\"Absolutely, I have done that myself and fully support that, but not when you perpetrate violence, obstruct, delay or obfuscate border patrol in the performance of their duties.\"\n\nIt was this line of attack that attracted the ire of the National Rifle Association, which criticised Mr Bovino’s dismissal of Second Amendment rights.\n\nAtlantic journalist Tyler Austin Harper, who carries a concealed firearm himself, wrote that the \"purpose of the Second Amendment is the prevention of tyranny\".\n\n\"What happened on Saturday was tyrannical,\" he added.\n\nWhen law enforcement has lost the gun lobby, it has lost the argument about Mr Pretti having a firearm at the scene.\n\nBorder patrol agents may (or may not) have their own bodycam video.\n\nMr Pretti’s phone contains video because he was filmed by others filming the border patrol action.\n\nIt’s possible that video may emerge to back up the US government’s claims.\n\nBut if it exists, surely they would publish it fast to cool down the public and political anger?\n\nTodd Blanche, the Deputy Attorney General (who is chiefly dealing with the Epstein Files), was also on the Sunday talk shows.\n\nHe defended the administration, but took a less confrontational approach than Mr Bovino.\n\nBut he also could not answer the question of whether Mr Pretti had \"brandished\" a gun at the border patrol officers.\n\nHis main attack was reserved for the state and city leadership, the mayor of Minneapolis and the state’s Governor Tim Walz.\n\nHe said: \"I do not see a single state and local law enforcement officer there to help.\n\n\"That should be the narrative that we're talking about, is that what we have is ICE doing isolated operations to get criminals off the street with zero cooperation from the governor, from leadership in Congress or from the mayor.\"\n\nHe added that what was observed was not peaceful protesting.\n\nMr Blanche said: \"That was a very violent occurrence because ICE cannot do their job effectively when law enforcement, local law enforcement, refuses to help.\n\n\"That is what is so tragic about what happened yesterday and what's been happening in Minneapolis for the past several weeks is that ICE is doing all of this work, doing their jobs and local law enforcement are not being allowed to do a single thing to help.\n\n\"That is dangerous, as we saw yesterday morning\".\n\nHe accused the interviewer, Kristin Welker, of the long-running Meet the Press programme on NBC of \"gaslighting\" after she said Mr Pretti was involved in peaceful protest.\n\nMr Blanch responded the situation was a \"very complicated, violent situation, with not a single law enforcement officer in sight\".\n\nThe political anger was immediately on display, with several Democratic senators saying they absolutely will not vote for the funding bill that is due before them this week as it provides funding for ICE, border patrol and the Department of Homeland Security (the funding head).\n\nTheir party leader in the Senate, Chuck Schumer, had said so in a statement on Saturday.\n\nBut the raw anger was on display in the TV interviews on talk show programmes on Sunday.\n\nMassachusetts Senator Ed Markey was the most fired up.\n\nHe said: \"Right now it is clear that the Trump administration, Stephen Miller, Christy Noem, all of them are engaged in a cover up.\n\n\"All of them are engaged in a whitewash of what happened.\"\n\nHowever, Mr Markey said such individuals \"cannot stop this outrage from rising all across our country, justifiably, because of what happened\".\n\nRepublicans, he said, \"may want to continue business as usual, but we cannot allow that to happen\".\n\n\"We cannot pass a Department of Homeland Security budget, I cannot vote for any budget that this administration is moving forward to continue to put more of Trump's secret police, masked gunmen on the streets of America,\" he added.\n\nHe continued: \"This is, without question, a cover up, a set of in real time fabrications that are being created by the Trump administration.\n\n\"It's all orchestrated right out of the Oval Office. Steven Miller is orchestrating this and giving the instructions to Kristi Noem, to Bovino, to all of them, just to just to implement this cover up strategy.\n\n\"So from the perspective of me, I'm not voting for any Department of Homeland Security budget.\"\n\nMr Markey described ICE as a \"rogue agency that Trump is threatening to send to other cities all across our country\".\n\nHe called for the resignations of Secretary Noem and Mr Bovino.\n\nConnecticut Senator Chris Murphy reacted to Mr Bovino’s interview describing it as \"bone-chilling\".\n\nHe said: \"I was shaking as I was listening to it, in large part because it takes just an unbelievable amount of gall to lie to the American public.\n\n\"I mean, everybody saw that video, and yet, there he was telling you and telling the American public that this young man was brandishing a weapon, that he was impeding officers, that he was there to attend a riot, that he was engaged in assault.\n\n\"When everyone can see that's not true, it should freak the American public out that the Trump administration lies this easily, will lie to your face when you can see the evidence for yourself.\"\n\nSenator Murphy also vowed to vote down the funding bill, but he also reached out to Republicans who are worried about what has been happening in Minneapolis.\n\nHe said: \"If we can get some serious reforms that save and protect lives in our cities, then we’ll come to the table.\n\n\"But this is something I think the American people demand of us right now.\n\n\"60-70% of Americans don't support what ICE is doing and they don't want Democrats or Republicans to fund this kind of lawlessness in our cities.\"\n\nSenator Amy Klobuchar, Minnesota's Senior Democratic Senator, said she was \"absolutely horrified\".\n\nMs Klobuchar said there had been \"three killings in Minneapolis since the beginning of the year\", adding two were \"committed by federal agents\" - one by an ICE agent and the other by border control.\n\n\"That's what we're dealing with here,\" she said.\n\nThe senator noted the agents are \"in the suburbs and the rural areas\".\n\n\"There's 3,000 of them outnumbering our local police,\" she said, adding that in Minneapolis-St Paul \"there are only 1,100 sworn officers\".\n\nMs Klobuchar said Mr Pretti’s parents had asked her to \"tell the truth about him\" after \"the Trump administration chose to call him a domestic terrorist\".\n\nShe said: \"They said Alex was a kind-hearted soul who cared deeply for his family and friends and also the American veterans whom he cared for as an ICU nurse at the Minneapolis VA hospital.\"\n\nThe senator said Mr Pretti had a \"self-sacrificing\" job and \"was loved at that hospital\".\n\nShe said: \"He chose to serve veterans, often in the last days of their lives.\n\n\"So when you see the video, and many Americans have seen it, you can see it from all different angles.\n\n\"What you see is someone brandishing a cell phone who is simply there with a cell phone, helping someone up, a woman up - as his parents point out - when she had slipped.\n\n\"When I hear the officials from the Trump administration describe this video in ways that simply aren't true, I just keep thinking, your eyes don't lie.\"\n\nSenator Klobuchar has filed papers to run as the Democratic Party candidate for Governor of Minnesota.\n\nThe current Governor, Tim Walz - who ran for vice president on the Kamala Harris ticket in 2024 - is not running again after the uncovering of a massive, multi-billion dollar social welfare fraud allegedly committed by Somali immigrants or their children, which happened on Mr Walz’s watch.\n\nAsked about this, Senator Klobuchar said: \"As a former prosecutor, what I believe is that people who rip off the taxpayers have to go to jail.\n\n\"There have been at least 90 people who have been charged so far, 80 under the past administration, additional ones.\"\n\nShe said she \"personally advocated for more funding to take on these righteous fraud cases, and also I actually advocated for the person, Joe Thompson, the lead prosecutor on these cases, to be acting attorney during the Trump administration.\n\n\"He's a fantastic prosecutor and, sadly, what happened was he and a number of the lead fraud prosecutors had to resign last week because, in their view, they were asked to do things that they felt were unethical, involving the Renee Good investigation.\"\n\nThis probe looked into the shooting of an unarmed woman by an ICE agent in Minneapolis - the event which spared the surge in protests over the immigration clampdown.\n\nMs Klobuchar will also vote against the funding bill in the senate this week.\n\nShe said: \"I didn't vote for tripling their budget over the summer, their budget went to $75 billion more. They're now bigger than the FBI and when they're killing two constituents in my state, and they're taking two year olds out of the arms of their mom and they are taking an elder among men out of his house and putting him out there in his underwear, and then figuring out they have the wrong man - no, I am not voting for this funding.\"\n\nFormer US presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton both decried the killings of Ms Good and Mr Pretti, with Mr Clinton accusing the Trump administration of lying and Mr Obama saying American values are under assault.\n\n\"All of this is unacceptable,\" Mr Clinton said as he urged Americans to \"stand up, speak out\".\n\n\"If we give our freedoms away after 250 years, we might never get them back.\"\n\nAt the time of writing, President Donald Trump was starting to post on his social media platform Truth Social.\n\nHe blamed Democrat-run \"sanctuary cities\" and states for causing the protests and ensuing violence by refusing to work with ICE and border patrol\n\nMr Trump said; \"Democrat run Sanctuary Cities and States are REFUSING to cooperate with ICE, and they are actually encouraging Leftwing Agitators to unlawfully obstruct their operations to arrest the Worst of the Worst People!\n\n\"By doing this, Democrats are putting Illegal Alien Criminals over Taxpaying, Law-Abiding Citizens, and they have created dangerous circumstances for EVERYONE involved.\n\n\"Tragically, two American Citizens have lost their lives as a result of this Democrat ensued chaos.\"\n\nThe president has called on Mr Walz and the mayor of Minneapolis to place all convicted illegal immigrants to prison or in police custody to ICE agents, and for Minneapolis police to cooperate with ICE and border patrol raids.\n\nHe also called on Congress to pass legislation to outlaw the practice of sanctuary cities and states.\n\nPolitical analyst Taegan Goddard wrote in Political Newswire that Mr Trump has lost control of the immigration clampdown narrative.\n\nHe said the president was frustrated with the way things were going up until Friday, with the issue dominating headlines for weeks, in the wrong way for him.\n\nThen the second Minneapolis killing happened.\n\n\"The timing could not be worse. More than 100 million Americans are stuck indoors this weekend under winter storm warnings, watching cable news and scrolling their social media feeds,\" he said.\n\nWhich raises the question Mr Trump cannot control: What happens when the country is forced to watch a man die on video - again and again - at the hands of the federal government?\n\nAnother week of fraught political battles lies ahead as the immigration issue becomes a crisis.","url":"https://www.rte.ie/news/analysis-and-comment/2026/0126/1555050-minnesota-shooting/","image":"https://www.rte.ie/images/0023cb6d-1600.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-26 06:01:21","author":"Sean Whelan","authors":["Sean Whelan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ie","sentiment":-0.287},{"id":396112676,"title":"The ICE killers are Donald Trump’s secret police","text":"It is snowing now here, outside of New York City where I live, and over much of America. The snow is beautiful, but I can only think of the last lines of Joyce’s “The Dead”: “he heard the snow falling faintly through the universe and faintly falling, like the descent of their last end, upon all the living and all the dead”. America is very nearly dead, and not with Joyce’s tender devastating rue, but with a devastating state violence and cruelty no living American has ever experienced.\n\nThere have not been three weeks since Renée Good, an innocent American citizen caught in the middle of an ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) operation in her native Minneapolis, was shot three times – in her arm, her left breast, and her head – by an ICE agent as she hysterically tried to drive to safety. Though video, taken from several different angles, clearly shows her driving her car away from the agent who shot her, the Trump administration continues to insist that she was a “domestic terrorist” who was trying to kill federal agents with her Honda Pilot, her young son’s toy animals lying half out of her glove compartment.\n\nAnd now, on Saturday (24 January), there was the equally cold-blooded murder of Alex Pretti. Pretti was a 37-year-old man who worked as a nurse in the intensive care unit of Minneapolis’s VA Health Care System, which is dedicated to caring for veterans. As with the shooting of Good, several videos, from a variety of angles, clearly show that Pretti posed no threat to the heavily armed ICE agents who surrounded him. He had gone to the scene to monitor ICE treatment of immigrants and protesters. He had both hands in the air, one holding his phone as he filmed the situation, the other empty. A born protector it seems, perhaps some sort of wounded sentinel – he lived alone with an “older dog” and touchingly conferred with his father before going to the ICE operation – he came to the aid of a woman protester who had been pepper sprayed in the face by an ICE agent. Something like seven burly agents, armed to the teeth, pounced on him, pushing him to the ground and beating him. One of the agents can clearly be seen taking a gun out of what appears to be Pretti’s belt and holding it in the air. Immediately after that, an agent shoots the defenceless VA nurse in the back, and another agent shoots him nine times. Minnesota law allows people to carry a concealed gun; it is reasonable to assume that Pretti took his with him because he was afraid.\n\nAs with Good, Trump and his people fell back on their by-now familiar strategy, dating back to Germany in the 1930s, of repeating a lie until people accept it as truth. Pretti, said Kristi Noem, the secretary of homeland security, “committed an act of domestic terrorism”. Gregory Bovino, the ICE “commander-at-large” – who likes to pronounce “Gestapo” on TV, with an echt “-shtapo”; as in, “we are not the Geshtapo” – claimed that Pretti wanted to “massacre law enforcement”. It is possible to imagine Steve Bannon, Trump’s de facto Minister of Public Engagement and Propaganda – he is a darling of the liberal media, always ready with metric-popping copy – making index cards for Trump on how to slowly bend democracy to his demented will: demonise, enrage, frighten, lie, inure to violence. That last seems to be what is happening in Minnesota now.\n\nFrom all reports, the agents who murdered Good and Pretti were veterans of ICE who had been with the agency for many years. It seems implausible, as people are saying, that they fired their weapons as a result of inexperience and a lack of training; as a result of being unprepared for the job they were sent to do. More likely is a different scenario: they are increasingly willing to kill on the slightest pretext. Because the cat is now out of the bag. Tim Walz, Minnesota’s governor, had it almost exactly right when he said at a news conference yesterday that, with the killings in Minnesota, America had reached an “inflection point”. The country is past inflection. It is speeding toward some sort of tyranny.\n\nThe dynamic is now as obvious as the videos of Good’s and Pretti’s murders. Having turned ICE into his very own secret police, Trump and his people are proceeding in stages. First they seemed to pursue only violent criminals who were in this country illegally. Then they expanded to include all undocumented immigrants. Then all immigrants were fair game. And now, having broken the sacred taboo of American police killing American citizens at will, they are, in effect, instructing all Americans to fear for their lives if they oppose the regime’s will. By not apologising, by not investigating, by promulgating, over and over, the very opposite version of what happened, they are signalling, baldly, their intentions to make their lawbreaking the new law of the land.\n\nShocked and outraged by violence, Americans and the American political establishment will rise up in implacable opposition. Inured to and exhausted by violence, the spirit of opposition will shrivel up and die on the vine of endless indignant editorials, op-eds and commentary: “Yes, we will wait for an investigation, but, please, in the meantime, be reasonable.” Where is Gavin Newsom, the pampered poseur? Where are the other Democratic presidential “frontrunners”? (Kamala Harris at least has an excuse: she has been busy closing on her new $8 million house in Malibu.) Where is the impassioned opposition of Democratic congressmen and senators? They primp and seethe for the cameras on CNN, but they are nowhere to be found on the floor of the House or the Senate, where they should be denouncing, by name, Trump, his cohorts, and the cowardly Republicans who enable them. The Democrats say they are going to make a brave stand and refuse to vote for continued funding for the Department of Homeland Security. That is like making a brave stand and refusing to eat Borscht in order to drive the Russians out of Ukraine.\n\nAmericans will be paralysed when, should the Republicans lose the House, and perhaps even the Senate, in the midterm elections this November, Trump declares the elections rigged, imposes martial law while recounts are being interminably done, and dispatches troops – by that point a wearyingly familiar presence in American places – to quell protests. But, then, even if there were to be some sort of civil, peaceful mass uprising, Trump would know what to do. He would simply manufacture another crisis, the liberal commentariat would apply themselves to their navels – Is Nato dead? Is the UN dead? Is the rules-based liberal order dead? Is the special relationship dead? – that crisis would fizzle out, and another would take its place, and so on.\n\nTwo things are for certain. These people are geniuses at creating havoc. With them, Goebbels meets PT Barnum. They thrive only in opposition, so they know, in their bones, how to make war on their own societies once they are in power. What is authoritarianism, after all, but a spirit of absolute liberty run amok on just one side? The other certain thing is that, come November, America will face a reckoning more critical than even the Civil War. Trump is obsessed with his election loss, his impeachments, his criminal prosecutions and criminal conviction. His vindictive fury is what drives him. If the Democrats carry the House in November, as they almost inevitably will, they will impeach him, several times over; Trump will never allow himself to be impeached again.\n\nThrough the spectacle of their crimes, up to and including killing, Maga are making it clear that, as they say in American gangster movies, “you will never take me alive”. Trump and his regime will never give up power voluntarily. Never. Americans, and America’s European allies, had better start getting that into their heads.\n\n[Further reading: On patrol with Ice-spotters in Minneapolis]","summary":"America is being terrorised into submission","url":"https://www.newstatesman.com/world/americas/north-america/us/2026/01/the-ice-killers-are-donald-trumps-secret-police","image":"https://dl6pgk4f88hky.cloudfront.net/2026/01/25/gettyimages-2257018169.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-26 06:00:00","author":"Lee Siegel","authors":["Lee Siegel"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.181},{"id":396191676,"title":"California produced two Republican presidents. Why not a Democratic one&quest;","text":"California once exported a national mood: confidence, growth, competence, a booming middle class, and large industries that represented national strength. That vision was the California that helped produce and endorse Republican presidents like Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, both from Southern California.\n\nModern California exports a different national image today: staggering costs, visible chaos, costly housing, soaring energy prices, and a politics that often seems geared toward deep-blue cities rather than the battleground states that determine presidential elections.\n\nThat branding shift explains why California has been able to elect Republican presidents but has struggled to produce a Democrat who can win a general election. It is also the challenge Gavin Newsom cannot ignore.\n\nWhen Nixon and Reagan rose, California’s identity aligned with broad national instincts. The Golden State possessed a strong national security credibility. California’s defense and aerospace stance conveyed seriousness and purpose, not just ideology. Additionally, the state’s strength was a broad middle class. The state represented a piece of the broader American Dream: a good-paying job, a home, and a future. Lastly, California had a competitive political culture. Candidates needed to win real swing voters within the state before attempting to win them nationally.\n\nCalifornia was also a presidential bellwether for a long period, reinforcing the idea that its politics were linked to the country’s core.\n\nGavin Newsom has repeatedly said that California is still the model. If true, it makes him a viable presidential candidate; if not, it hampers his chances of running and winning in 2028.\n\nDuring his recent State of the State address, Newsom stated: “In California, we are not silent… We are a beacon. This state is providing a different narrative. An operational model, a policy blueprint for others to follow.”\n\nHe also embraced the idea that criticism is outdated or irrational, dismissing opponents as people suffering from “California Derangement Syndrome” and telling “them,” specifically Donald Trump and his spokespeople, that “it’s time to update your talking points.”\n\nThat line might resonate in Sacramento, and with partisan Democrats nationwide, but to most Americans, his rhetoric hits differently. “Talking points” are not just talking points; they reflect lived experiences for voters who see California as a warning sign: high housing costs, taxes, regulations, disorder, and a governing culture that seems allergic to correction.\n\nCalifornia’s biggest political liability isn’t a single policy; it’s the result of decades of poor policy choices. The state feels unaffordable and overly managed.\n\nThat is why the migration story matters. People vote with their feet when costs conflict with quality of life. Domestic migration trends have been a consistent part of the California story, and the current trend reinforces the national view that the state is no longer the future of America. Governor Newsom’s claims of a “reversal” is a headline trick. California is still losing people to other states — it’s just being offset by international migration.\n\nIn presidential politics, perception turns into shorthand, and shorthand becomes reality.\n\nThis reality is Governor Newsom’s Achilles’ heel, as he tries to sound tough and impatient, especially on homelessness. “No more excuses, it’s time to bring people off the streets, out of encampments, into housing, into treatment. Counties need to do their job!”\n\nThose are talking points from a governor who recognizes the nation’s vulnerability: the footage of a downtrodden humanity in multiple cities remains undeniable. For many swing-state voters, California has become known for increased spending and reduced results. Remember the George H.W. Bush ads about Boston Harbor against Michael Dukakis? The ads against a Gavin Newsom presidential campaign write themselves.\n\nJerry Brown and Kamala Harris faced the same underlying dynamic: a Democrat from California doesn’t just run as an individual. They run as a symbol of California governance.\n\nCalifornia has voted Democratic for president in every election since 1992, which Democrats statewide boost, but this one-party domination creates a national paradox: the state’s leaders are rewarded for winning debates within a deep-blue coalition, while presidents are elected by forming cross-regional majorities of swing voters.\n\nNewsom’s final state-of-the-state address and his appearance at Davos feel like a national audition, and the underlying message is clear: he is aiming to rebrand California as “the blueprint.”\n\nIs the country buying the brochure?\n\nNixon and Reagan benefited from a California that represented America in motion. Newsom is attempting to nationalize a California that many voters view as America’s warning sign.\n\nHe can attack the critics. He can mock “derangement.” He can call the state a “beacon.”\n\nBut as long as California’s main export remains the cost-of-living crisis and visible disorder, a California Democrat, and one from San Francisco at that, will keep losing the same argument in the same states: not over ideology, but over basic competence and lived reality.\n\nMatthew Klink is a Los Angeles-based Republican political consultant who has worked on political campaigns internationally, nationwide, and in 40-plus states.

Even though the people running the paper helped guarantee that fate. The Post was always liberal but not until this century, a liberal rag. Today, the entire newspaper is the width of the ad supplement I used to stuff in it every Sunday morning as a DC suburb paperboy. For a hundred years before then and decades after, it was the shining star for news, entertainment, and education. The Washington Post improved my mind and changed the course of my life. Yet too many of my ideological allies celebrating its demise fail to see the epic tragedy.\n\nThe Post made a major cultural splash with great fanfare, literally, in 1889, inspiring a classic tune by the great John Philip Sousa, The Washington Post March. Yet the paper struggled until the mid-1940s, when owner Eugene Meyer hired a brilliant lawyer, Philip Graham, to work for it. With his marriage to Meyer’s daughter, Katharine, Philip took control of the paper, making it a Washington — and national — powerhouse.\n\nIn 1963, the mentally disturbed (now known as bipolar disorder) Graham shot himself in the head with his shotgun. His widow Katharine took over the Post, becoming one of the first women to run a newspaper. Her wisest move was hiring Ben Bradlee, a true Hemingwayesque hero, as Managing Editor.\n\nBradlee had joined the Navy right after Pearl Harbor, serving as a destroyer communications officer in the Pacific. After the war, he became a beat reporter, then a Newsweek foreign correspondent during the most turbulent decade of the Cold War. Newsweek promoted him to Washington Bureau Chief in 1957. As such, he befriended young Senator John F. Kennedy, who gave Bradlee unprecedented access to his inner circle pre and post Election 1960. This caught the notice of Katharine Graham, who eventually elevated Bradlee to Executive Editor of her paper.\n\nUnder Bradlee’s reign, the Post became as powerful and influential as the “paper of record,” the New York Times — more so after Watergate. The investigative journalism of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein that led to the resignation of the Left-despised President Nixon — and the bestselling book and superb movie, All the President’s Men — became the gold standard for every young aspiring reporter. They didn’t know the whole thing was a liberal fabrication to get Nixon. Neither did I as a kid right out of college and new Washington Post copyboy in 1983.\n\nIt was the media Camelot at the time, and the legends were still there — Graham, Bradlee, Woodward (now Head of Investigative), Howard Simons (played by Martin Balsam in the film), a few others but not Bernstein (being ripped by ex-wife Nora Ephron in her bestselling novel, Heartburn) — and we awestruck youth darted in and out among them. We all wanted the same thing — to be the next Woodward. Or Mel Gibson in The Year of Living Dangerously. That’s how crazy we kids were — vying to cover a violent revolution in some Third World hellhole as a good career move.\n\nThe Post editors wouldn’t send us to Nicaragua but they did let us write local stories the staff reporters didn’t want — Boy Scout jamborees, vintage theater closings, etcetera — and to be on the lookout for fast-breaking ones. We strutted around Washington with our green press badges ready to pounce on anything of interest. And what we wrote was read all over town, mine with the byline by Lou Aguilar, Special to the Washington Post.\n\nI turned out to be one of the best writers among my peers. So various editors would drop into the copy-aide station where we slung mail and assign me to cover more events. Bob Woodward liked me, enough to take an interest in my stories and kid around with me.\n\nBut Ben Bradlee was inaccessible. He radiated power like Jason Robards did portraying him so wonderfully. I once rode up the elevator with Bradlee and three bigshot editors. He made a semi-joke about the elevator lights and the editors chortled like it had been a Don Rickles line.\n\nI discovered something at the Post. Everybody else was liberal from Bradlee down to my fellow copy-aides — including the only girl I’d ever loved, a beautiful radical feminist (I fictionalized and updated that story in my semiautobiographical novel, Paper Tigers). I was the only Reaganite there.\n\nI remember Election Night 1984. We were ordered to work late supporting the editors and reporters. My good, now late, friend Bob grimaced. “Who wants to go to the Wake,” he said, meaning for Walter Mondale. Yet we were all friends and lovers before the Left went nuts — and destroyed the Washington Post. Today it’s a woke madhouse.\n\nIn 2022, Post owner Jeff Bezos, himself a liberal yet a good businessman, hired political centrist Robert Winnett of the UK Daily Telegraph as Executive Editor to save his sinking ship. The Post staffers went ape, lashing out on social media and threatening to quit, as if the British were coming again. Winnett naturally withdrew rather than hose down the lunatics like Bezos should have.\n\nBut that was nothing compared to the rebellion that followed Bezos’ decision that the Post not endorse Kamala Harris in the last election. Resignations actually ensued. Some unknown Post columnist named Karen Attiah called it “a stab in the back.” She’ll probably be one of the many layoffs. But the Post will never be what it was. And I get no joy from that.\n\nREAD MORE from Lou Aguilar:\n\nStarfleet Academy: To Boldly Go Nowhere\n\nThe Harpy Syndrome\n\nExit the Hollywood Women, Part 2 — Kathleen Kennedy","summary":"Unlike some other conservatives, I can’t help feeling saddened by rumors of imminent mass layoffs at the already deflated Washington...","url":"https://spectator.org/the-washington-toast/","image":"https://spectator.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Washington_Post_building-scaled-e1769383753225.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-26 03:20:01","author":"Lou Aguilar","authors":["Lou Aguilar"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.235},{"id":396073754,"title":"More Republicans join call for investigation into fatal ICE shooting in Minneapolis","text":"WASHINGTON, D.C. — A growing number of Republicans are pressing for a deeper investigation into federal immigration tactics in Minnesota after a U.S. Border Patrol agent fatally shot a man in Minneapolis, a sign that the Trump administration’s accounting of events may face bipartisan scrutiny.\n\nHouse Homeland Security Committee Chairman Andrew Garbarino sought testimony from leaders at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, saying “my top priority remains keeping Americans safe.”\n\nA host of other congressional Republicans, including Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas and Sens. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, pressed for more information. Their statements, in addition to concern expressed from several Republican governors, reflected a party struggling with how to respond to Saturday’s fatal shooting of Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care nurse at a VA hospital.\n\nTrump administration officials were quick to cast Pretti as the instigator. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was among those who said Pretti “approached” immigration officers with a gun and acted violently. Videos from the scene show Pretti being pushed by an officer and then a half-dozen agents descend on him. During the scuffle, he is holding a phone but is never seen brandishing the 9mm semiautomatic handgun police say he was licensed to carry.\n\nThe killing has raised uncomfortable questions about the GOP’s core positions on issues ranging from gun ownership to states’ rights and trust in the federal government.\n\nCassidy, who is facing a Trump-backed challenger in his reelection bid, said on social media that the shooting was “incredibly disturbing” and that the “credibility of ICE and DHS are at stake.” He pushed for “a full joint federal and state investigation.” Tillis, who is not seeking reelection, urged a “thorough and impartial investigation” and said “any administration official who rushes to judgment and tries to shut down an investigation before it begins are doing an incredible disservice to the nation and to President Trump’s legacy.”\n\nMurkowski called for an investigation and added that “ICE agents do not have carte blanche in carrying out their duties.” Collins, the only incumbent Republican senator facing reelection in a state Democrat Kamala Harris carried in 2024, said a probe is needed “to determine whether or not excessive force was used in a situation that may have been able to be diffused without violence.”\n\nWhile calling for protesters to “keep space” from law enforcement and not interfere, Collins said federal law enforcement must “recognize both the public’s right to protest and the highly charged situation they now face.”\n\nEven Sen. Pete Ricketts, a staunch ally of President Donald Trump, called for a “prioritized, transparent investigation.”\n\n“My support for funding ICE remains the same,” the Nebraska Republican, who is up for reelection, said online. “But we must also maintain our core values as a nation, including the right to protest and assemble.”\n\nTrump and other administration officials remained firm in their defense of the hard-line immigration enforcement tactics in Minneapolis, blaming Democrats in the state along with local law enforcement for not working with them. Many Republicans either echoed that sentiment or stayed silent.\n\nIn a lengthy social media post on Sunday evening, Trump called on Minnesota’s Democratic leadership to “formally cooperate” with his administration and pressed Congress to ban so-called sanctuary cities.\n\nThe White House will likely face at least some GOP pushback\n\nTrump has enjoyed nearly complete loyalty from fellow Republicans during his first year back in the White House. But the positions staked out in the wake of the shooting signal the administration will face at least some pushback within the party in its swift effort to define Pretti, who protested Trump’s immigration crackdown, as a violent demonstrator.\n\nDeputy White House chief of staff Stephen Miller issued social media posts referencing an “assassin” and “domestic terrorist” while Noem said Pretti showed up to “impede a law enforcement operation.”\n\nAt a minimum, some Republicans are calling for a de-escalation in Minneapolis.\n\nOklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt told CNN’s “State of the Union” that the shooting was a “real tragedy” and Trump needs to define an “end game.”\n\n“Nobody likes the feds coming to their states,” Stitt said. “And so what is the goal right now? Is it to deport every single non-U.S. citizen? I don’t think that’s what Americans want.”\n\nVermont Gov. Phil Scott said the shooting was “not acceptable.”\n\n“At best, these federal immigration operations are a complete failure of coordination of acceptable public safety and law enforcement practices, training and leadership,” he said in a post. “At worst, it’s deliberate federal intimidation and incitement of American citizens.”\n\nEchoing criticism that local law enforcement isn’t cooperating with federal officials, Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., suggested the administration focus its immigration efforts elsewhere.\n\n“If I were President Trump, I would almost think about if the mayor and the governor are going to put our ICE officials in harm’s way and there’s a chance of losing more innocent lives or whatever, then maybe go to another city and let the people of Minneapolis decide do we want to continue to have all these illegals?” he told “Sunday Morning Futures” on the Fox News Channel. “I think the people of Minnesota would rebel against their leadership.”\n\nA sensitive moment for the GOP\n\nPretti’s killing comes at a sensitive moment for the GOP as the party prepares for a challenging midterm election year. Trump has fomented a sense of chaos on the world stage, bringing the NATO alliance to the brink last week. Domestically, Trump has struggled to respond to widespread affordability concerns.\n\nMeanwhile, approval of his handling of immigration — long a political asset for the president and the GOP — has tumbled. Just 38% of U.S. adults approved of how Trump was handling immigration in January, down from 49% in March, according to an AP-NORC poll.\n\nThe killing spurred notable tension with the GOP’s long-standing support for gun rights. Officials say Pretti was armed, but no bystander videos that have surfaced so far appear to show him holding a weapon. The Minneapolis police chief said Pretti had a permit to carry a gun.\n\nYet administration officials, including Noem and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have questioned why he was armed. Speaking on ABC’s “This Week” Bessent said that when he has attended protests, “I didn’t bring a gun. I brought a billboard.”\n\nSuch comments were notable for a party where support for the Second Amendment’s protection of gun ownership is foundational. Indeed, many in the GOP, including Trump, lifted Kyle Rittenhouse into prominence when the then-17-year-old former police youth cadet shot three men, killing two of them, during a 2020 protest in Wisconsin against police brutality. He was acquitted of all charges after testifying that he acted in self defense.\n\nIn the wake of Pretti’s killing, gun rights advocates noted that it is legal to carry firearms during protests.\n\n“Every peaceable Minnesotan has the right to keep and bear arms — including while attending protests, acting as observers, or exercising their First Amendment rights,” the Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus said in a statement. “These rights do not disappear when someone is lawfully armed.”\n\nIn a social media post, the National Rifle Association said “responsible public voices should be awaiting a full investigation, not making generalizations and demonizing law-abiding citizens.”\n\nRep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., who is often critical of the White House, said “carrying a firearm is not a death sentence.”\n\n“It’s a Constitutionally protected God-given right,” he said, “and if you don’t understand this you have no business in law enforcement or government.\n\nThe second-ranking Justice Department official said he was aware of reports that Pretti was lawfully armed.\n\n“There’s nothing wrong with anybody lawfully carrying firearms,” Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said on “Meet the Press” on NBC. “But just make no mistake about it, this was an incredibly split-second decision that had to be made by ICE officers.”","summary":"The killing has raised uncomfortable questions about the GOP’s core positions on issues ranging from gun ownership to states’ rights and trust in the federal government.","url":"https://www.cleveland.com/nation/2026/01/more-republicans-join-call-for-investigation-into-fatal-ice-shooting-in-minneapolis.html","image":"https://www.cleveland.com/resizer/v2/LQKTNJUSSRBQLKSHGIBJCZSV2I.jpg?auth=802429eb270d61feeb53b131c3e7c4c866ff7215dafa5c51f206abd64068ce17&width=1280&smart=true&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-26 03:09:53","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.153},{"id":396069276,"title":"Republican calls grow for deeper investigation into fatal Minneapolis shooting","text":"A growing number of Republicans are pressing for a deeper investigation into federal immigration tactics in Minnesota after a U.S. Border Patrol agent fatally shot a man in Minneapolis, a sign that the Trump administration's accounting of events may face bipartisan scrutiny.\n\nHouse Homeland Security Committee Chairman Andrew Garbarino sought testimony from leaders at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, saying “my top priority remains keeping Americans safe.” \n\nA host of other congressional Republicans, including Rep Michael McCaul of Texas and Sens Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Susan Collins of Maine, and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, pressed for more information.
