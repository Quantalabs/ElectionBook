The ring is ginormous!”\n\nRich Goldberg of Safian & Rudolph Jewelers, told The Independent, “Based on the limited photos we currently have, the center diamond looks to be an elongated cushion cut of approximately five to six carats.”\n\n“A diamond shaped like this could also be a ‘old mine’ brilliant cut, which is essentially an antique diamond, with a cushion shape.

Shaw — whose algorithm-driven trades made it the most profitable hedge fund in 2024, raking in $11.1 billion for investors, according to Institutional Investor — counts Amazon’s Jeff Bezos and Bill Clinton’s Treasury Secretary Larry Summers among its former employees.\n\nLast month, The Post exclusively reported how DE Shaw’s management feared reprisals from the Trump administration over the hedge fund’s DEI stance — prompting them to shelve diversity programs and scrub “woke” language from its website.\n\n“David Shaw pretends to be this progressive and moral hedge fund manager, but he makes women and minorities who work at his firm give up their civil rights to collect their pay — and he is trying to normalize that practice for all New Yorkers,” Michalow said.\n\nThe Post has approached DE Shaw for comment.\n\nInstitutional Investor first reported on Michalow’s court petition on Monday.\n\nIn June 2022, Michalow won the largest defamation judgment in Wall Street history — $52 million in damages — after an arbitration panel set up by financial watchdog FINRA ruled DE Shaw had smeared him by falsely telling media outlets he had been fired in 2018 for sexual misconduct.\n\nMichalow, who always denied any wrongdoing, left the company not long after the start of the #MeToo movement, where hundreds of rich and powerful men were accused of sexual misdeeds.\n\nAt the time, he refused to sign a release to shield the company from legal liability for any misconduct by its executives during his employment and three years after it ended. Any potential agreement also would have come with highly restrictive non-compete clauses.\n\nAccording to Michalow’s court petition, DE Shaw claims the practice is “widespread” across the US financial industry — but Michalow counters that it’s not standard any any number of high-profile hedge funds, among them Citadel, Two Sigma and Jane Street.\n\n“This is different from a very common practice, which is when firms pay extra severance or a settlement payment in exchange for a release,” Michalow said. \n\nA March brief to the Court of Appeals written by Michalow’s attorney Jeremy Wallison claimed that DE Shaw “confiscated” more than $14.4 million of his pay when he declined to sign away his rights.\n\n“What DE Shaw does is to say: we are not going to pay you the money you are otherwise owed unless you release claims for discrimination, sexual harassment, etc.”\n\n“DE Shaw, which is one of the largest hedge funds in the world and a highly influential employer in the State, embeds the “release for pay” scheme in its standard contracts with its employees,” Wallison wrote.\n\nAs a result, the hedge fund is “systematically impeding hundreds of New York-based employees from filing suits for intentional torts, sexual harassment, racial discrimination – literally any form of misconduct the firm inflicts,” he added.\n\nThis newspaper also reported back in 2019 how billionaire financier David Shaw splashed out $37 million in donations to top Ivy League colleges in an apparent bid to secure places for his kids.\n\nAll three of Shaw’s children with his financial journalist wife Beth Kobliner went to Yale. \n\nThe 74-year-old is also a longtime Democrat party donor, having helped finance the presidential campaigns of Barack Obama, Joe Biden, and Kamala Harris.","summary":"Dan Michalow, 43, has launched a petition to challenge the \"release-to-pay' employment conditions imposed on staffers","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/08/26/business/ex-de-shaw-trader-asks-ny-court-to-ax-release-to-pay-contracts-that-silence-employees/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/110112549.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/6MDr8XWo-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-26 22:49:36","author":"James Franey","authors":["James Franey"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.208},{"id":354615722,"title":"Trump Reacts To Taylor Swift-Travis Kelce Engagement, And It’s Not What Anyone Expected","text":"US President Donald Trump has reacted publicly to the engagement of pop superstar Taylor Swift and NFL tight end Travis Kelce, offering an unexpectedly warm message despite his previously harsh comments about the singer.\nJust hours after Swift and Kelce announced their engagement on social media on Tuesday, Trump was asked for his thoughts on the duo during his interaction following the Cabinet meeting.

But what made Trump’s reaction particularly noteworthy was the apparent shift in tone. In the past, the President had openly criticised Swift, especially after she endorsed his 2024 opponent, former Vice President Kamala Harris.\nIn a Truth Social post from September 15, 2024, Trump lashed out at the singer, writing bluntly, “I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!” The post drew criticism from Swift’s fans.\nIn May 2025, Trump doubled down on his disdain, suggesting the singer’s popularity had waned. “Has anyone noticed that, since I said ‘I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT,’ she’s no longer ‘HOT?’” he wrote, taking credit for what he claimed was a decline in her public image. The post was linked to earlier comments in which he praised actress Sydney Sweeney as “the hottest” after seeing her jeans ad, while mocking Swift’s supposed reception at the Super Bowl.\nTrump’s latest comments have surprised many, given his prior history with the Grammy-winning artist.\nMeanwhile, Swift and Kelce have been romantically involved since 2023, with the pop star frequently seen at Kansas City Chiefs games. Their engagement has drawn headlines worldwide, and reactions continue to pour in across social media, from fans, celebrities, and now, the President of the United States.","summary":"The engagement announcement came during Trump’s Cabinet meeting and quickly became a trending topic online.","url":"https://www.news18.com/world/trump-reacts-to-taylor-swift-travis-kelce-engagement-and-its-not-what-anyone-expected-ws-l-9530401.html","image":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2025/08/Untitled-design-5-2025-08-d7acb20573d39727c4cae432516ab92b.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-26 22:40:47","author":"New.storytailors,News18,World Desk","authors":["New.storytailors","News18","World Desk"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.172},{"id":354629012,"title":"DNC speaker dismisses concerns over migrant crime, carjackings at summer meeting: ‘Not a top concern for most Americans’","text":"During a presentation on crime at the DNC's summer meeting, a lady from left-wing think tank the Vera Institute tells them that \"migrant crime and carjackings are things that don't matter to many Americans.\" pic.twitter.com/5c0qkCPm7O— Greg Price (@greg_price11) August 25, 2025\n\n“You want to talk about the crime issues voters care about,” Rahman said, pointing to polling conducted by Vera’s political arm that ranks gun violence (36%), homelessness and public drug use (34%), and muggings or assaults (34%) as Americans’ top safety concerns. Migrant crime and carjackings ranked lower, at 28% and 29%, respectively.\n\n“Where does Trump go?” she asked rhetorically. “Migrant crime, carjackings, the really lurid, awful stuff that is a crazy, crazy visual. Don’t take the bait,” she advised. “Most Americans are more worried about how we address mental health issues, visible homelessness, and the drivers behind the random incidents that scare all of us.”\n\nLater in the meeting, Oakland Mayor Barbara Lee, a longtime progressive figure and the city’s first Black woman mayor, made headlines by touting Oakland’s refusal to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement.\n\n“Oakland is not afraid. We embrace all residents, including our immigrant communities,” Lee said. “Our police do not cooperate with ICE.

It was incredibly fun and a great way to “engage with actual human beings in real life and learn about your city.” \n\nThat’s his pollster speaking, by the way. \n\n“There’s at least 1.5K+ people in line at the Zohran Scavenger Hunt,” exclaimed a post on X that netted 5 million views. “All of 17th Street at Union Square is packed. People are eager to receive the first clue!” \n\nThat report came from a DSA activist who followed Mamdani on every step of his walk down the length of Manhattan before the primary election.\n\nIf you don’t believe either of them, you can listen to Amanda Litman, former Hillary Clinton campaign staffer and the founder of Democrat activist PAC Run for Something.\n\n“A thing Zohran and his campaign have powerfully tapped into — and that his scavenger hunt captures so perfectly — is that a vast majority of the people who live here genuinely love New York City,” Litman gushed. “We wouldn’t stay here otherwise!” \n\nNotice a theme? Sounds a lot like someone’s mom insisting that the birthday party egg-and-spoon race in the rain was a blast. \n\nNow, having missed out on the scavenger hunt, it’s impossible for me to say whether it was fun or not. Maybe it was the most thrilling event of the summer.\n\nBut the rhetoric around the day’s fun sounds a little forced. \n\nIt reminds me a lot of another campaign that was supposed to embody fun.\n\nThe electoral dream team of Kamala Harris and Tim Walz sparked, if you recall, a “new politics of joy,” as Errol Louis wrote in New York magazine last August. \n\nWalz publicly thanked then-Veep Harris for “bringing back the joy.” \n\nKamala herself, asked what makes her so joyful, explained in her trademark word-salad fashion: “I find joy in the American people. I find joy and optimism in what I see to be our future . . . I find joy in the ambition of the people. I find joy in the dreams of the people. I find joy in building community. . .” \n\nIn reality, the Harris/Walz campaign was miserable, with a nominee who was evidently a terror to work for, two running mates who detested each other and an incumbent who sometimes appeared to be rooting for the other side. \n\nSo atop all that dysfunctionality, the Harris/Walz campaign smeared a heaping helping of joy to make things seem sweet as candy. \n\nA charming smile, after all, can paper over a lot of faults. And Zohran Mamdani oozes charm. \n\nIs the threadbare vapidity of the Mamdani campaign starting to show?\n\nHis policies, after all, are absurd. \n\nFree buses just mean less money for the MTA — or for the city, which will have to cover the fares. \n\nAll “freezing the rent” means is deferred maintenance on our decrepit housing stock. \n\nAnd “city-owned grocery store” is just a fancy term for “food pantry” — because, let’s face it, City Hall isn’t looking to compete with Citarella, but to offer New Yorkers in “food deserts” a place to buy tomatoes and chicken thighs. \n\nMeanwhile, for a supposedly grassroots, popular campaign, the Mamdani movement is strangely locked-down and remote.\n\nFor instance, two recent events with Staten Island Democrats were blanketed by the sort of security you might expect to encounter at a ritzy wedding reception in the elite districts of Kampala, Uganda. \n\nInvitations to meet with Mamdani on Saturday went out with strict instructions of secrecy; multiple layers of registration and vetting were conducted. The final details of where and when were released at the last minute. \n\nAnd this was an event limited to active members of the county Democratic Party, including sitting public officials! \n\nWhy the need for control — unless Machine Mamdani is running a little hot and the bolts holding it together are starting to rattle? \n\nThis isn’t to say that Mamdani is not going to win.

On Tuesday, the American pop princess took to social media to reveal that her partner, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce , had proposed to her after two years of dating. In recent weeks, rumours had been swirling about Taylor and Travis' relationship, with fans speculating that they had secretly become engaged at the back end of July. But in a joint post today, the couple confirmed the news in a series of pictures, with one showing Travis proposing to the Bad Blood songstress. Captioning their post, the happy couple penned: \"Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married,\" alongside a stick of dynamite emoji. Swift, who has 280 million Instagram followers, also posted a heart on her Instagram story with her song So High School from the anthology version of the album The Tortured Poets Department, which is said to have been written about her fiancé, playing in the background. In one snap, Taylor is seen crying as she hugged her now fiancée. Travis gets down on one knee, surrounded by stunning flowers in a garden. Looking emotional, another snap shows the couple posing for the camera, with Travis resting his arms around Taylor's waist while she cradles his face as they gaze lovingly at one another. Her engagement ring features one large diamond, with the gold band resting on her finger as it glistens under the sun. Now, President Donald Trump , who has never minced his words about Taylor, appears to have decided to end their long-running feud. During a cabinet meeting, a reporter asked the president about the news. Trump replied: \"Well, I wish them a lot of luck, I think he's a great player, I think he's a great guy, and I think that she's a terrific person. So I wish them a lot of luck.\" Over the years, the former reality star has shaded Taylor, writing on Truth Social last year: \"I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!\" after she endorsed former Vice President Kamala Harris. Earlier this year, he commented: \"Has anyone noticed that, since I said 'I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT', she's no longer hot?\" He, however, isn't the only famous person to offer a celebratory message to Travis and Taylor. Travis' teammate, Patrick Mahomes, shared the news on his Instagram story alongside three love heart emojis. Meanwhile, Brittany Mahomes also shared the news, writing: \"Two of the most genuine people meet and fall in love. Just so happy for these two.\" Meanwhile, the official Instagram account for Prince William and Princess Kate had \"liked\" Taylor and Travis' post. But they're not the only royals, William's sister-in-law, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex had also liked the post. Singer Avril Lavigne, who has previously performed on stage with Swift, also sent \"huge congratulations\" to the singer and Kelce in a post on her Instagram story. The Kansas City Chiefs also congratulated the couple in a post on X, formerlly known as Twitter which read: \"Today is a fairytale. \"Congrats to Travis and Taylor – we’re excited to have you as a permanent member of the Chiefs Kingdom family.\" The NFL ’s official Instagram account also congratulated the pair twice, first sharing a video compilation of Swift attending games with the words “what a journey”, while another post showed a clip of the pair celebrating Kelce’s 2024 Super Bowl win. Taylor's engagement ring is an Old Mine Brilliant Cut, and her jewellery was designed by Kindred Lubeck of Artifex Fine Jewellery. Travis and Taylor's love story began back in July 2023, when Travis made his way to Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City—not for a Chiefs match-up, but rather to be amidst the buzz of Taylor's iconic Eras Tour. On his podcast New Heights, which he hosts with his brother Jason Kelce, he later dished out the details about his real motives for attending the gig. The American footballer had planned to pass Taylor his phone number via a friendship bracelet, only to find out she avoids talking pre and post-concerts to preserve her vocal cords. Fortunately, he got a second shot at winning her over when Taylor heard of his bold gesture. The following September, Travis was quizzed about his relationship with Taylor. Dodging the personal talk during an NFL + interview, he stated: \"I'm not gonna talk about my personal life,\" as Andrew Siciliano probed for details. However, the buzz only intensified when Taylor showed up to cheer on Travis at his 24 September game, accompanied by none other than his mum, Donna Kelce, causing a stir among media and fans. Come November, the pair's bond was as evident as ever, particularly when Travis jetted off to Buenos Aires for Taylor's 11 November Eras Tour performance. Taylor's fans couldn't help but swoon when she tweaked the lyrics in \"Karma\" to nod directly to her beau's career: \"Karma is the guy on the Chiefs coming straight home to me.\" A few weeks down the line, Travis candidly expressed his admiration for Taylor during an intimate chat with The Wall Street Journal: \"Being around her, seeing how smart Taylor is, has been f*cking mind-blowing. I'm learning every day.\" Like this story?

TAYLOR SWIFT AND NFL STAR TRAVIS KELCE ARE ENGAGED AFTER 2 YEARS TOGETHER \"They didn’t call me. They called Brittany. I was in the back of the FaceTime,\" Mahomes said at training camp, while reflecting on the big announcement Swift made on the show about her upcoming album, The Life of a Showgirl. \"Just knowing Taylor and being a little closer to the process of how she makes the albums, it’s going to be amazing because of all the work that she puts into it.

Given Kelce and Patrick Mahomes are best friends on and off the field, it only seemed right their significant others would bond while watching them on gameday, which is exactly what happened. During the 2024 presidential election, there were rumors of a potential rift after Swift endorsed then-Vice President Kamala Harris, while Brittany Mahomes liked a post from President Donald Trump on Instagram and wrote several messages responding to critics. Those rumors heated up when they sat in separate suites during the Chiefs’ first game of the 2024 season against the Baltimore Ravens, and Trump himself added fuel to that fire after an interview on \"Fox & Friends\" where he said he liked Brittany \"much better\" than Swift. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP But those rumors are clearly dispelled now, as the Mahomes family couldn’t be more excited for this next chapter with their friends.

The DNC's Resolutions Committee, meeting on Tuesday during the second day of the national party's annual summer meeting, unanimously passed a resolution affirming what it highlighted as the \"American Values' of diversity, equity, and inclusion. The approval of the resolution, which will face a vote by the full 400-plus DNC membership on Wednesday, comes amid relentless conservative backlash against DEI programs in recent years. DNC CHAIR DEMANDS DEMOCRATS ‘STOP BRINGING A PENCIL TO A KNIFE FIGHT' During the 2024 election cycle, now-President Donald Trump and Republicans repeatedly criticized Democrats for their longstanding support for DEI efforts and transgender rights, turning the Democrats' stance into a political liability. Republicans spent tens of millions on ads last year bashing transgender women in female sports. A commercial targeting then-Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic Party's 2024 presidential nominee last summer and autumn, argued that \"Kamala is for they/them, Donald Trump is for you.\" DEMOCRATS DIVIDED: TENSIONS FLARE OVER WAR IN GAZA Following last year's election setbacks, when Democrats lost control of the White House and Senate and failed to win back the House majority, some in the party have second-guessed their support for DEI and transgender rights. Trump, in the opening months of his second term in the White House, has signed several executive orders taking aim at transgender and DEI policies implemented by then-President Joe Biden and by major universities and corporations. But DNC committee member Bill Owen of Tennessee, who spoke in support of the resolution in front of the panel, took aim at Republicans as he praised DEI values. HEAD HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS REPORTING ON DIVERSITY, EQUITY, AND INCLUSION \"These are American values. This is what America was built on,\" Owen said. \"And to my Republican friends and fellow citizens…who profess to be active Christians, I remind them that D.E.I.is the very foundation of the Christian church. I get a little emotional on this, but Jesus loves little children. All the children of the world. Red and yellow, black and white.\" \"This week's DNC meeting has proven once again just how disconnected Democrats are from the values and priorities of everyday Americans,\" RNC communications director Zach Parkinson told Fox News Digital. \"The DNC reaffirmed their party's support for radical, racist DEI ideology and insulted Christians across the country by saying DEI is 'the very foundation' of Christianity. It's no wonder Democrats' approval rating is in the toilet.\" The vote by the Resolutions Committee on the DEI resolution came a day after Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Harris' running mate on the Democrats' 2024 national ticket, said in an address at the DNC summer meeting that \"we're proud to be a diverse party. We are proud of the diversity of this country. We're not shying away from diversity as a strength and equity as a goal and inclusion being the air we breathe. That's what we should be doing.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP DEI efforts have been aimed at fostering fair treatment and full participation for all people, particularly those who have faced discrimination or underrepresentation.

Meanwhile, President Donald Trump is urging other Republican-governed states to gain additional U.S. House seats for the GOP.\n\nThe revised district lines could potentially make one of Utah’s four congressional seats a viable target for Democrats, as the party endeavors to overturn the GOP’s narrow House majority. On a national level, Democrats must gain three seats next year to secure control of the chamber.\n\nThe current configuration divides the densely populated Salt Lake County—an enclave of Democratic support within a predominantly red state—across all four congressional districts. Prior to the map’s adoption in 2021, one district alternated between Democrat and Republican control. Since then, Republicans have won in all districts by significant margins.\n\nHere’s what to know about Utah’s place in the redistricting fight.\n\nJudge says the current map defies voters\n\nOn Monday, a judge directed the Republican-led Utah Legislature to discard its congressional map and swiftly establish a new one. District Court Judge Dianna Gibson deemed the map illegal on the grounds that the Legislature bypassed an independent redistricting commission, set up by voters to prevent deliberate partisan advantage, commonly known as gerrymandering.\n\nIn 2018, voters narrowly endorsed a ballot initiative that formed the commission to delineate boundaries for Utah’s legislative and congressional districts, which the Legislature was obligated to consider. However, lawmakers repealed the initiative in 2020, replacing it with legislation that converted the commission into an advisory body that could be ignored. Subsequently, lawmakers disregarded a congressional map suggestion from the commission and devised their version.\n\nThe Utah Supreme Court indicated that the Legislature has very limited authority to modify laws passed by voters and remanded the case to Judge Gibson to resolve the map’s status.\n\n“How district lines are drawn can either safeguard representation and ensure accountability by elected representatives or erode public trust, silence voices and weaken the rule of law,” she wrote in the ruling.\n\nGibson has given lawmakers until Sept. 24 to adopt a map that complies with voter-approved standards. Voting rights advocates who were involved in the legal challenge can submit alternate proposals. But Republican officials could use appeals to try to run out the clock before a candidate filing deadline in early January to possibly delay adopting new maps until 2028.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court is unlikely to intervene, and the state Supreme Court may be hesitant to entertain an appeal after it already asked Gibson to decide.\n\nNew district lines mean new matchups\n\nUtah’s four congressional districts currently converge within a couple blocks in the Salt Lake City suburb of Millcreek. A voter could grab a milkshake at the beloved Iceberg Drive Inn and cross into all four districts before it melts.\n\nLawmakers presented the map as a way for each representative to serve both urban and rural areas. One district spans the entire eastern border of the state and groups vastly different communities, from the winter resort town of Park City, to the urban center of Provo, down to the red rock recreation hub of Moab. Voting rights groups who challenged the map argued it intentionally dilutes the Democratic vote and produces congresspeople who aren’t suited to represent all of their constituents.\n\nThe tight deadline for lawmakers to draw new maps could push them to reconsider proposals from the independent redistricting commission that they had ignored after the 2020 census. Those plans create a compact district combining the Democrat-heavy cities of Salt Lake City and Park City, while grouping other cities geographically. \n\nGOP leaders could cut their losses by creating a single left-leaning block, or gamble on creating competitive districts that Republicans will fight to keep.\n\nVoters’ partisan makeup is a bit murky\n\nRegistered Republicans overwhelming outnumber registered Democrats in the state, however voter registration data doesn’t paint the full picture.\n\nOnly about 12.3% of Utah voters are registered Democrats, but more than triple that amount voted for Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. About 29% are unaffiliated, and many voters in the state who hold liberal beliefs choose to register as Republicans to vote in the primaries and have a say in intra-party matters.\n\nThat uncertainty may create complications for Republicans as they navigate rapidly redrawing boundaries that shield their seats while complying with stricter standards.\n\nUtah redistricting shakes up the fight for Congress\n\nThe ruling throws Republicans a curveball in a state where they expected a clean sweep while they’re working to add winnable seats elsewhere. Trump has urged governors to take up mid-decade redistricting ahead of the midterms, when the sitting president’s party tends to lose seats.\n\nIn Texas, a plan awaiting Gov. Greg Abbott’s approval includes five new districts that would favor Republicans. Ohio Republicans already were scheduled to revise their maps to make them more partisan, and Indiana, Florida and Missouri may choose to make changes. Some Democrat-led states say they may enter the redistricting arms race, but so far only California has taken action to offset GOP gains in Texas.\n\nThe Supreme Court in 2019 ruled that claims of partisan gerrymandering for congressional and legislative districts are outside the purview of federal courts and should be decided by states.\n\nRedistricting typically occurs once a decade after a census. There are no federal restrictions to redrawing districts mid-decade, but some states — more led by Democrats than Republicans — set their own limitations. The Utah redraw may benefit Democrats who have fewer opportunities to gain seats through redistricting.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nSALT LAKE CITY – Utah finds itself embroiled in a national dispute&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Utah Unwillingly Joins 2026 Redistricting Controversy: Key Information You Need to Know first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/utah-unwillingly-joins-2026-redistricting-controversy-key-information-you-need-to-know/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Utah-enters-the-redistricting-battle-for-2026-but-not-by.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-26 21:41:45","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.201},{"id":354606762,"title":"Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce announce engagement on social media","text":"A joint post on their Instagram pages showed pictures of Kelce down on one knee making his marriage proposal in a flower-laden garden, and then Swift displaying a large diamond ring. \"Your English teacher and gym teacher are getting married,\" the pair, both aged 35, joked in a caption.

The election is still years away, but recent surveys suggest more Democratic voters are leaning toward Newsom.The governor garnered national attention for engaging in high-profile battles with President Donald Trump and Republicans. This includes his efforts to redraw his state's congressional boundaries in response to Texas Republicans' plan for mid-decade redistricting, opposition to Trump's attempts to federalize the National Guard to quell protests in Los Angeles earlier this summer and social media trolling on X.Some Democrats believe Newsom is meeting calls to fight back harder against Republicans following frustration among the party's voter base over what many viewed as a feeble response to the Trump administration.What To KnowA new poll from Morning Consult shows how Newsom's support has grown in the primary field over the past few months. The poll found that 19 percent of Democrats plan to support the governor, compared to 11 percent in June and 5 percent in March.Meanwhile, former Vice President Kamala Harris' support has slipped from 36 percent to 29 percent, the poll found.The pollster noted that other potential candidates, including Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat who is a favorite among progressives, and former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, have \"virtually the same level of backing as they had in our first look this year.\"Newsom's support has grown amid a 19-point increase in support among Gen X and a 15-point increase among white voters and men, according to the poll. His support among Black voters has also increased by 7 percent, though Harris still holds 45 percent support among Black voters.The poll surveyed 1,000 Democratic and Democratic-leaning independent voters from August 22 to August 24, 2025.Other polls have also shown an increase in Newsom's support this summer.An Echelon Insights poll, which surveyed 1,057 registered voters from August 14 to August 18, showed him with 13 percent, up from 4 percent in April. Harris still had the support of a majority of Democratic voters, with 26 percent backing her.An AtlasIntel poll, which surveyed 1,435 adults from July 13 to July 18, showed him with 16 percent support, up from 7 percent in May. Still, that poll showed Buttigieg at 27 percent and Ocasio-Cortez at 19 percent. Harris received 14 percent support in that poll.What People Are SayingCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom told The Wall Street Journal in June: \"I'm not thinking about running, but it's a path that I could see unfold.\"CNN's Harry Enten said in an August 20 X post: \"Newsom's social media strategy/opposition to Trump is working. He's gained millions of social media followers. Google searches for him are up like a rocket. He's now the frontrunner for the 2028 Dem nomination per the prediction markets. It's cause Democrats want a fighter.\"President Donald Trump told reporters in June: \"He's done a terrible job. I like Gavin Newsom. He's a nice guy, but he's grossly incompetent, everybody knows.\"What Happens NextTypically, candidates don't make campaign announcements until after the midterms, and Newsom's second term as governor will end at the start of 2027. A multitude of prominent Democrats are expected to run. Until then, polls will continue to be monitored to gauge Americans' views on potential presidential candidates.","summary":"Newsom's support is growing among Democratic voters, according to a new poll.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/gavin-newsom-surges-democratic-primary-poll-2119733","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2709963/california-governor-gavin-newsom.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=248cf4a7ce9b20f0155e0974d80bacd4","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-26 21:11:18","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.093},{"id":354600458,"title":"Watch: Trump reacts to Taylor Swift’s engagement","text":"Donald Trump sent his well-wishes to his sometimes nemesis Taylor Swift after she announced her engagement to Travis Kelce.\n\nThe 35-year-old shared a photo of Kelce, also 35, down on one knee in a garden filled with white and pink roses beneath a decorative arch.\n\nAs Swift’s army of fans, known online as Swifties, took the news in, so did America’s newsrooms.\n\nFox News even cut away from live coverage of Mr Trump’s ongoing cabinet meeting to break the news of the engagement.\n\nThe US president, who had been locked in meeting for three hours, was later asked for his response by a member of the press.\n\nMr Trump, who has previously dismissed the singer as a “very liberal person” and “no longer hot”, wished the couple good luck.\n\n“I think he’s a great player.

Thank you for your attention to this matter!”\n\nTrump has a long history of comments against Swift, who has seldom mentioned the president.\n\nYet, before his presidency, Trump had praised the singer on several occasions, such as in 2012 when he tweeted that Swift was “fantastic” following the announcement of her Grammy hosting role.\n\nBut things turned sour in 2018, when she piped into the Tennessee midterm race and asked fans to vote against Republican Marsha Blackburn.\n\n“I like Taylor’s music about 25% less now,” Trump said to White House reporters following her endorsement of the Democratic candidate. \n\nThe next time the two crossed paths was in 2023, when he was asked to give his take on the now-engaged couple as they made their relationship public.\n\n“I wish the best for both of them,” he said to the Daily Caller during an interview.\n\n“I hope they enjoy their life. Maybe together, maybe not — most likely not.”\n\nIn February 2024, the president again brought up the couple, and said there was no way “she could endorse Crooked Joe Biden” in a Truth Social post. \n\n“Besides that, I like her boyfriend, Travis, even though he may be a Liberal, and probably can’t stand me!”\n\nUp until then, Swift had barely brought up the president. \n\nBut things took a turn when Swift endorsed former Vice President Kamala Harris, his opponent, in the 2024 presidential election.\n\n“I was not a Taylor Swift fan. It was just a question of time … She’s a very liberal person, she seems to always endorse a Democrat,” he said on Fox and Friends. \n\nOn September 15, just days after the endorsement, he said his most bold statement against the singer yet, simply writing on Truth Social: “I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!”\n\nBoth Swift and Trump then attended this year’s Super Bowl, which was a match-up between the Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs, Kelce’s team.\n\nAt one point, Swift came up on the big screen, facing a wave of boos. \n\nAfter the game, Trump posted: “The only one that had a tougher night than the Kansas City Chiefs was Taylor Swift.”\n\n“She got BOOED out of the Stadium. MAGA is very unforgiving!”\n\nThree months later, he came out with another Truth Social post: “Has anyone noticed that, since I said ‘I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT,’ she’s no longer ‘HOT?’.” \n\nHis latest comments came just weeks ago, where he said that he hated her once again.\n\nBut it seems as if Trump has decided to bury the hatchet with Swift. \n\nAfter the comments, many had differing reactions to his change of heart. \n\n“Bro just wants an invite to the wedding,” one user wrote on X.\n\n“Never thought I’d read a headline where Trump blesses Taylor Swift’s love life,” another said.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nPRESIDENT Donald Trump had a surprising message for Taylor Swift after the&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Donald Trump&#8217;s Unexpected Congratulations to Taylor Swift on Her Engagement Following Years of Disputes first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/donald-trumps-unexpected-congratulations-to-taylor-swift-on-her-engagement-following-years-of-disputes/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Donald-Trumps-surprising-message-for-Taylor-Swift-on-her-engagement.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-26 21:02:00","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.179},{"id":354633076,"title":"Hollywood Democrats Are M.I.A. as Their Party Goes Down in Flames","text":"That’s the consistent sentiment veteran entertainment journalist Richard Rushfield says he’s getting from industry power players. “A better description of Hollywood’s opposition mobilization would be ‘MIA’ or ‘non-existent.’ ‘Totally invisible’ also works,” Rushfield writes in The Ankler, the slick inside-Hollywood newsletter he helps helm.\n\nHe points to the dearth of Democrat fundraisers, for instance.

Katie Porter is leading other candidates for California governor, but the contest is still anyone’s game with nearly half of surveyed voters undecided, according to the latest independent poll Tuesday of the nascent race to replace Gov. Gavin Newsom in 2026.\n\nThe newly-released survey of nearly 5,000 registered voters throughout California by the UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies echoes several other polls that have found enthusiasm for Porter, a former Orange County congresswoman who left Congress in January after she ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate last year.\n\nPorter received 17% of the voters’ first picks. Trailing her were Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco, a Republican, at 10%, and former U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, a Democrat, at 9%.\n\nThe pollsters emphasized that many more respondents hadn’t made up their minds yet. Nearly 40% of the voters surveyed said they were undecided.\n\n“She’s got a small lead, let’s put it that way,” said Mark DiCamillo, the institute’s polling director. “I wouldn’t say she’s the favorite. It’s a wide-open race.”\n\nIt’s the second independent poll of the governor’s race this month that found Porter leading the field, but with small shares of voters. An earlier poll by Emerson College found 18% of voters favored Porter, followed by 12% who favored Republican Fox News commentator Steve Hilton. The British-born media personality and political advisor has traded barbs with Bianco as the top Republican competing for their party’s backing.\n\nMeanwhile, Porter quickly raked in support from donors when former Vice President Kamala Harris announced late last month that she will not run for governor. A spokesperson for Porter did not respond to a comment request.\n\nIn her statement explaining her decision, Harris left the door open for a possible run for president in 2028, which would be her third attempt. But the new survey suggests she’d see less support from voters than another California Democrat: Newsom, who has positioned himself as a national leader of the opposition to President Donald Trump and is speaking openly about his presidential aspirations.\n\nThe poll found that 69% of California Democrats would be enthusiastic if Newsom ran for president, compared to 54% for Harris.\n\nThe pollsters conducted their survey online from August 11 to August 17 in English and Spanish. The margin of error was plus or minus two percentage points. Some of the voters’ information was provided by Political Data, Inc. The data firm’s vice president, Paul Mitchell, played a leading role in crafting the gerrymandered political districts that California voters will consider in a November special election.","summary":"It's too early to say \"front runner,\" but another poll found Katie Porter leading the crowded field.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/08/26/poll-finds-enthusiasm-for-katie-porter-in-governor-race-and-newsom-for-president/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/OCR-L-KATIEPORTER-0411-31.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-26 20:11:40","author":"Grant Stringer","authors":["Grant Stringer"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.014},{"id":354585120,"title":"Watch Donald Trump’s Surprise Message For Newly Engaged Taylor Swift -Travis Kelce","text":"In a moment that blended pop culture with politics, President Donald Trump was asked for his reaction to Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s engagement while attending a high-profile Cabinet meeting on Tuesday.

It’s for American Eagle, and the jeans are 'flying off the shelves.' Go get ‘em Sydney!\" Trump wrote on Aug. 4.\n\n After slamming ads from other companies like Bud Light and Jaguar — which Trump described as \"woke\" — the president then shifted the conversation to Swift.\n\n \"Just look at Woke singer Taylor Swift,\" he wrote in the post. \"Ever since I alerted the world as to what she was by saying on TRUTH that I can’t stand her (HATE!). She was booed out of the Super Bowl and became, NO LONGER HOT.\"\n\n He continued: \"The tide has seriously turned — Being WOKE is for losers, being Republican is what you want to be. Thank you for your attention to this matter!\"\n\n Swift and Kelce, both 35, announced their engagement in an Instagram post on Tuesday, sharing photos from the football star's romantic proposal and the unique ring he helped design.\n\n \"Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married 🧨,\" Swift captioned the post.\n\n The couple opened up about their relationship earlier this month on Kelce's New Heights podcast, with Swift sharing how Kelce's initial \"wild, romantic gesture\" — trying to meet her on her Eras Tour and then telling the world about how \"butt hurt\" he was when it didn't happen — ultimately won her over.\n\n \"I was like, 'If this guy's not crazy, which is a big if, but if he's not crazy, then this is basically every song I've ever written since I was a teenager come to life,\" Swift said.\n\n Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer.\n\n The Super Bowl champ joked that he used the Eras Tour setlist as a blueprint to win Swift's heart: \"I was sitting there at the Eras Tour listening to every single one of those songs being like, 'I know exactly what she wants me to do'... I'm the luckiest man in the world.\"\n\n Swift agreed, noting, \"It was wild, but it worked. I'm glad it worked.\"","summary":"The president has been publicly critical of Swift on several occasions, going so far as to declare his \"hate\" for her","url":"https://people.com/donald-trump-surprising-reaction-taylor-swift-engagement-11798101","image":"https://people.com/thmb/EOxZ9kLkuwdgSoV2ShAEAYHGbuo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(742x242:744x244)/trump-travis-kelce-taylor-swift-082625-4ec3e9d9570843fcaac99c18601ef873.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-26 19:58:18","author":"Meredith Kile","authors":["Meredith Kile"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.185},{"id":354601090,"title":"Trump, who has not been shy about his dislike of Taylor Swift, reacts to Travis Kelce engagement","text":"President Donald Trump has reacted to the news of Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s engagement.\n\nPop superstar Swift and Super Bowl-winning NFL player Kelce announced the news in a joint Instagram post Tuesday afternoon, sending the internet into a frenzy.\n\nTrump, however, was in an hours-long cabinet meeting, seemingly unaware of the pending nuptials until a reporter asked for his thoughts.\n\n“Well, I wish them a lot of luck,” he said. “I think it’s— I think he’s a great player, I think he’s a great guy and I think that she’s a terrific person. \n\n“So I wish them a lot of luck.”\n\nLast September, the Republican, 78, declared his hatred of Swift after she endorsed Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. “I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT,” he wrote in all caps on Truth Social at the time.\n\nSwift’s endorsement of the former Vice President came within hours of the conclusion of the first and only presidential debate between Harris and Trump.\n\nSince then, he has erupted in repeated tirades against the “Love Story” singer.\n\nAt the 2025 Super Bowl game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles, the Grammy-winning artist, who was in attendance to support her boyfriend, Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, was loudly booed by Eagles fans.\n\nTrump, who was also in attendance, later shared a screenshot of a post from an account called Libs of TikTok showing clips of fan reactions to both him and Swift.\n\n“Trump gets massive cheers at the Super Bowl while Taylor Swift gets booed – The world is healing,” the account wrote.\n\nShortly afterwards, he mocked the “Cruel Summer” singer-songwriter, resharing an edited image of her holding a flag stating, “Trump won, Democrats cheated!”\n\nThen, in April, the President taunted Swift over the Chiefs’ 40-22 loss to the Eagles during his speech at the latter’s White House invitational to celebrate their victory.\n\n“I was there along with Taylor Swift — how did that work out?” Trump said.\n\nIn May, he launched an unprovoked attack on the “Fortnight” singer, writing from his Truth Social account: “Has anyone noticed that, since I said ‘I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT,’ she’s no longer ‘HOT?’”\n\nMost recently, Trump compared Swift to actor Sydney Sweeney, writing on Truth Social earlier this month: “Sydney Sweeney, a registered Republican, has the ‘HOTTEST’ ad out there,” he wrote. “It’s for American Eagle, and the jeans are ‘flying off the shelves.’”\n\n“Or just look at Woke singer Taylor Swift.

Earlier this afternoon, the pop star and the Kansas City Chiefs tight end announced the proposal via an Instagram post captioned, “Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married.” And in the accompanying photos, her go-to watch over the past couple years—a diamond-set Cartier in yellow gold—is prominently displayed next to her gleaming new ring.\nLike many iconic celebrities before her, Swift understands that a classic Cartier timepiece is the ultimate all-occasion watch. It looks great whether she’s accepting an award, announcing a new album, or getting engaged to a guy wearing khaki shorts.\nWhat’s notable about this latest look at Swift’s timepiece—and this the clearest view of it we’ve had yet—is that what we’d previously believed to be a Cartier Panthère in fact appears to be a lesser-known model called the Cartier Santos Demoiselle. (Both Vogue and Dimepiece have ID’d it as such.) While both models are similar in shape and size, the latter is a discontinued women’s variation of the iconic Santos de Cartier, the Parisian house’s first-ever wristwatch that debuted in 1904.\nIt’s notable that Swift opted for the Santos Demoiselle. While the Panthère has long been a favorite among powerful women (including Princess Diana, Madonna, Jane Fonda, and Kamala Harris) it made perfect sense that a global megastar like Swift would’ve wanted to carry forward that legacy. In choosing the Santos Demoiselle, however, Swift is not only displaying a sharp taste in vintage timepieces but also aligning herself with the rich history of the Santos de Cartier—a watch originally designed for the swashbuckling Brazilian aviator Alberto Santos-Dumont and famously worn by such trailblazers as Lou Reed, Tyler, the Creator, and the fictional Gordon Gekko of Wall Street.\nBut what I find most interesting about Swift's Cartier is that it doesn’t seem to fit neatly into any part of the singer’s vast mythology. While virtually all of the musician’s choices can be dissected for significance—the video for “Anti-Hero” is about as rich a text as Ulysses—the Santos doesn’t seem to be a part of these same machinations. (Though perhaps the time displayed on the watch in the engagement photos—10:25 to our eye—bears some meaning that some dedicated Swiftologists can parse out. Her album is due out in October, the 10th month, of 2025…) Instead, the Cartier has simply become a constant companion for Swift, a reliable accessory in life’s everyday moments—and its biggest ones.\n\nUpdate, 8/26/25: Thanks to Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s engagement photos, we’ve now received a much clearer look at Swift’s watch. It appears to be a Cartier Santos Demoiselle, not a Panthère as we previously reported.","summary":"The singer paired her striking new ring with her go-to Cartier timepiece.","url":"https://www.gq.com/story/taylor-swift-engagement-watch-cartier-santos-demoiselle","image":"https://media.gq.com/photos/68adfddca73ab032150241c6/16:9/w_4000,h_2250,c_limit/2196124549","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-26 19:44:02","author":"Cam Wolf","authors":["Cam Wolf"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.803},{"id":354581784,"title":"Watch: Trump’s shocking reaction to Taylor Swift, Travis Kelce’s engagement","text":"Even Donald Trump couldn’t escape a Taylor Swift question this week.At a press conference on Tuesday, before diving into a serious query about visas for Chinese students, a reporter asked the US president for his reaction to Swift’s engagement to NFL star Travis Kelce.Trump’s response was unexpectedly cordial: “I wish them a lot of luck.

But the map offers few opportunities for Democrats to flip seats, with many of the Republicans seeking reelection hailing from states that President Trump comfortably won in 2024. Meanwhile, the retirement of three Senate Democrats up for reelection in 2026 has created possible openings for the GOP. With 53 Republicans in the upper chamber, Democrats would need to defend seats in some competitive states, while flipping four seats in order to secure a majority. The key races likely to determine who controls the Senate after 2026 are beginning to take shape, with contentious primary challenges in some states and newcomers to watch in a handful of open seats in the upper chamber. North Carolina is expected to hold the most expensive contest, while Texas is seeing a bitter GOP primary fight that Democrats hope will play to their advantage.Here's what to know about the state of play in the key 2026 Senate races:North CarolinaNorth Carolina was already expected to be competitive in 2026, even before GOP Sen. Thom Tillis announced in June he wouldn't seek reelection. The open seat in the Tar Heel State has emerged as a key prize as Democrats look to make gains in the Senate.President Trump won the state by more than three points in 2024, and North Carolina has historically voted for Republicans in every presidential race — with the exception of Barack Obama in 2008 — which also marked the last time the state sent a Democrat to the Senate. But Democrats are hoping to flip the Senate seat in 2026, with their dream recruit, former North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper.Cooper, who announced his Senate bid in July, is a two-term governor and the longest-serving state attorney general in North Carolina's history. The contest heated up days after Cooper entered the race, when Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley announced a bid for the open seat, teeing up what's expected to be among the most expensive races of the cycle. Whatley has never run for office but played a key role in Mr. Trump's reelection effort. He's leaning on his conservative acumen and an endorsement from the president, as well as the connections he's forged as RNC chair. With the race's implications for control of the Senate, along with the presence of two well-connected candidates with fundraising chops, advertising spending is likely to surge. GeorgiaWidely viewed as the most vulnerable Democrat this election cycle, Sen. Jon Ossoff is seeking a second term in the Senate after he eked out a win in the 2020 elections when the Georgia race went to a runoff. Ossoff's narrow victory secured a Democratic majority in the Senate, at the same time Joe Biden became the first Democrat to win Georgia in a presidential election since 1992. But Georgia flipped again in 2024, supporting Mr. Trump, making Ossoff the only incumbent Democrat this cycle defending a seat the president won in the last election.With a number of Republicans already jockeying to take on Ossoff, the GOP primary threatens to be a bruising one for the party. Reps. Buddy Carter and Mike Collins, along with former Tennessee football coach Derek Dooley have all entered the race. And though Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp opted not to launch a bid, Dooley is widely seen as his pick. Meanwhile, the president, who has publicly clashed with Kemp in recent years, has yet to endorse a candidate. New HampshireDemocratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen announced in March that she won't seek reelection, opening up what could be a competitive race in the Granite State. Though Republicans have controlled the governor's mansion since 2017, a Republican hasn't carried New Hampshire in a presidential election since 2000, and the state last elected a Republican to the Senate in 2010. Still, Republicans have put up a number of formidable challenges in the state in recent years, and the GOP is aiming to capitalize on the open seat this cycle.On the Republican side, former Sen. Scott Brown, who represented Massachusetts from 2010 to 2013, launched a bid to represent New Hampshire in the Senate after falling short against Shaheen in 2014. State Sen. Dan Innis, who launched two unsuccessful House bids, is also running. Former New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu passed on a bid earlier this year, despite having the president's support. Democratic Rep. Chris Pappas, who's represented New Hampshire in the House since 2019, announced a bid for Shaheen's seat in April and quickly earned her endorsement. In early August, Karishma Manzur, a medical scientist, became the first Democrat to challenge Pappas in the primary. MichiganDemocratic Sen. Gary Peters' surprise announcement in January that he wouldn't seek reelection in 2026 opened up a key seat in the battleground state, which has flipped in the presidential races between President Trump in 2016 to former President Joe Biden in 2020 and back to Mr. Trump in 2024. Without the advantage traditionally provided by an incumbent, Democrats are drawing from a wide talent pool, with a crowded primary already underway. Though Biden administration Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg considered entering the race, he ultimately passed on a bid earlier this year. Among the Democrats who have entered the race so far are Rep. Haley Stevens, state Sen. Mallory McMorrow and former Michigan health official Abdul El-Sayed. In Michigan, which has the largest concentration of Arabs in the U.S., Israel's war in Gaza is expected to become a key issue in the primary. On the GOP side, former Republican Rep. Mike Rogers also launched a bid earlier this year, after falling short in his race against Sen. Elissa Slotkin last year. Mr. Trump endorsed the Army veteran last month, saying that from \"the U.S. Army to Congress, Mike has served our Nation with distinction, and will bring that same Fighting Spirit to the U.S. Senate.\"MaineRepublican Sen. Susan Collins is up for reelection in 2026. First elected to the Senate in 1996, the five-term senator is among the most independent-minded in the GOP caucus, often breaking with her party. She's survived a handful of challenges from Democrats in previous races, but it remains to be seen whether the 72-year-old can fend off a Democratic challenge in a state that Kamala Harris won in 2024 by almost seven points. Democrats have been trying to recruit Gov. Janet Mills, a 77-year-old two-term governor, in an attempt to unseat Collins. The entrance of a political newcomer in Democrat Graham Platner, a veteran and oyster farmer who has billed himself as an anti-establishment candidate, could complicate things for the party. TexasAlthough the Texas Senate race isn't expected to be as competitive in the general election, the Republican primary has been heating up in recent months as Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton challenges Sen. John Cornyn for his long-held seat in the upper chamber. Cornyn, 73, has been in the Senate since 2002 and served as the No. 2 Republican from 2013 to 2019. Paxton, a 62-year-old staunch ally of the president, has criticized Cornyn for questioning whether Mr. Trump could win a general election in 2024. And although Cornyn has worked to mend the relationship with Mr. Trump, becoming a vocal supporter of the president's second term agenda, the dynamic has made for a messy primary fight so far — and added to speculation about his eventual endorsement. Meanwhile, the Texas attorney general, who was reelected to a third term as the state's top prosecutor in 2022, has faced a series of controversies in recent years, with an impeachment and criminal securities fraud charges that were later dismissed. In July, his wife announced that she had filed for divorce on \"biblical grounds.\" On the Democratic side, former Rep. Colin Allred is pursuing another Senate bid after falling short against Sen. Ted Cruz by more than eight points last year. Allred is expected to face another uphill battle in 2026, but Democrats see his chances as improving, should the more conservative Paxton win the primary.OhioFormer Sen. Sherrod Brown's announcement this month that he is launching a comeback bid to once again represent Ohio in the Senate marked a major recruiting victory for Democrats, though the Ohio race is still expected to be a tough battle for the party.Brown lost his 2024 bid for a fourth term in the upper chamber against GOP challenger Sen. Bernie Moreno in a cycle that saw the president win in the state by more than 10 percentage points. Brown lost to Moreno by less than four points. And with the party that controls the White House typically losing ground in midterm elections, Democrats see a chance to flip the seat, forcing Republicans to spend heavily in the state in the process. In 2026, Brown will face off against Sen. Jon Husted, a Republican who previously served as Ohio's lieutenant governor and was appointed in January to fill Ohio's other Senate seat, which Vice President JD Vance vacated.MinnesotaDemocratic Sen. Tina Smith announced in February that she wouldn't seek reelection in 2026, creating an open Senate seat in Minnesota for the first time since 2008.Though the North Star State hasn't elected a Republican to the Senate since 2002 and the GOP hasn't carried the state in a presidential election since the 1970s, the Republicans saw the state shift toward their direction in 2024, and they aim to capitalize on that in the race for the open seat in 2026. Among Democrats, leading candidates Minnesota Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan and Rep. Angie Craig are facing off. And a dominant candidate has yet to materialize in the crowded GOP field, which includes former NBA player Royce White, who fell short in his 2024 bid against Sen. Amy Klobuchar. Adam Schwarze, a retired NAVY Seal, also launched a bid for the open seat earlier this year.IowaRepublican Sen. Joni Ernst is up for reelection in Iowa in 2026, but the two-term senator has yet to announce whether she plans to run again. The Hawkeye State hasn't elected a Democrat to the Senate since 2008, and a Democrat would face steep chances in a state Mr. Trump won by more than 13 points in 2024. But Democrats are hopeful, as the Iowa Republican has faced scrutiny in recent months. Ernst, a 55-year-old who was elected to the Senate in 2014, has been criticized by Democrats over comments she made about Medicaid cuts, and she was hammered by the GOP base over her initial reluctance to support Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's confirmation. The Democratic field is crowded, with state Rep. Josh Turek, state Sen. Zach Wahls and Nathan Sage, executive director of the Knoxville Chamber of Commerce, vying for the nomination. State Rep. J.D. Scholten had also launched a campaign, but he bowed out earlier this month and endorsed Turek as Democrats' best chance to defeat Ernst. NebraskaIn July, independent Dan Osborn announced another bid to represent Nebraska in the Senate, after falling short against Sen. Deb Fischer, the Republican incumbent, by seven points in 2024. After the unexpectedly competitive race last year where he significantly outperformed Harris, the union leader is challenging GOP Sen. Pete Ricketts in 2026. But Republicans are expected to be better prepared for the challenge in the deep red state this time around. Ricketts, one of the wealthiest members of Congress, was appointed to the Senate in 2023, upon former Sen. Ben Sasse's retirement, and handily won his bid in a special election last year to serve out the remaining two years of Sasse's term.","summary":"Democrats are trying to retake the Senate majority in the midterms, but to do so, they'd need to defend 13 seats and flip four more.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/key-senate-contests-2026-elections/","image":"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/08/26/17b384c8-6747-490e-b4ad-3ce417dc7c60/thumbnail/1200x630/4dd66cbfc81722e4800b6726df0a7dc4/gettyimages-2217482675.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-26 19:32:50","author":"Kaia Hubbard","authors":["Kaia Hubbard"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.1},{"id":354580448,"title":"Democrat Zach Wahls Edges Out Republican Joni Ernst in New Iowa Poll","text":"GOP Senator Joni Ernst trailed Democratic state Senator Zach Wahls and was held to a tight race against other Democratic candidates in a new internal poll of the Iowa Senate race form Wahls' campaign.Ernst Campaign Manager Bryan Kraber responded to the poll in a statement to Newsweek.\"The Selzer poll was known as the gold standard until it claimed a Dem could win Iowa in 2024. Look no further than how that turned out to know that Iowans fully embrace Republican policies over paying higher taxes or pure hogwash like allowing men in women's sports,\" he said.A spokesperson for state Representative Josh Turek, another Democrat running for the nomination, told Newsweek he is in \"striking distance of defeating Joni Ernst\" after entering the race only weeks ago.Newsweek reached out to each campaign included in the poll for comment via email.Why It MattersA Democratic victory in Iowa, a former swing state that has turned firmly red and backed President Donald Trump by double digits in 2024, will be an uphill climb—but Democrats will need to win in more conservative territory if they hope to win back a Senate majority next November. Republicans currently hold a 53-47 in the upper chamber.Democrats are targeting GOP seats in Maine, which backed former Vice President Kamala Harris by about seven points, and North Carolina, which voted for Trump by about three points, as their top targets for the midterms. But no other GOP-held seats in single-digit Trump or Harris-won states are up for grabs, meaning Democrats must compete in double-digit Trump states like Alaska, Iowa, Ohio or Texas to flip control of the chamber.But Iowa has not elected a Democratic senator since 2008 and backed Trump in each of his three presidential bids—including by 13 points last November, an indication of how Republican the state has become.What To KnowThe Senate race has drawn several Democratic candidates including Wahls, who represents an Iowa City-based district in the state Senate; Nathan Sage, a veteran and executive director of Knoxville, Iowa's chamber of commerce; Jackie Norris, a teacher and school board member; and state Representative Josh Turek.A new Public Policy Polling survey showed Ernst in a tight race against Democratic challengers. She held narrow leads over each candidate on the initial ballot, which provided names without further information.In that poll, Ernst led Wahls by one point (43 percent to 42 percent), Sage by four points (45 percent to 41 percent), Norris by three points (45 percent to 42 percent) and Turek by four points (45 percent to 41 percent).However, when voters were told more about each candidate, Wahls jump out to a lead over Ernst (45 percent to 43 percent).Ernst still led other candidates on the informed ballot. She led Sage by two points (44 percent to 42 percent) and both Norris and Turek by one percent (44 percent to 43 percent).The poll surveyed 572 Iowa voters from August 18 to August 19 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.1 percentage points.Republicans are favored to hold the Iowa Senate seat, according to Kalshi betting odds, which give the GOP a 74 percent chance and Democrats a 26 percent chance of winning next November.The poll was commissioned by the Wahls campaign, reported the Iowa City publication Little Village Magazine.While Ernst has not formally launched her reelection campaign, she has appointed a campaign manager and raised $1.8 million in the first half of 2025, the Associated Press reported.Democrats remain hopeful that a strong national environment, fueled by Trump's faltering approval rating and economic concerns surrounding tariffs, can make the race more competitive than expected. Democrats have also highlighted Ernst saying, \"We're all going to die,\" when pressed about cuts to Medicaid.What People Are SayingBrendan Koch, campaign manager for the Turek campaign told Newsweek: \"Just weeks after launching his campaign, Josh is already in striking distance of defeating Joni Ernst.

I think he’s a great player, and he’s a great guy, and I think she’s a terrific person,” Trump said.\n Back in 2024 after Swift endorsed Trump’s presidential rival Kamala Harris, the then presidential candidate posted online, “I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!” Trump says he’s ready to go to court to try and carry out his ordered firing of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook Cook responded to Trump saying he’d terminate her by preparing a court challenge against what she called the president’s “illegal action.” Asked about that during his Cabinet meeting, Trump was dismissive, offering, “You always have legal fights.” “She seems to have had an infraction, and you can’t have an infraction,” he added of Cook.\nHe said “we have some very good people” in mind to replace Cook if she’s removed.\n Rubio, who has many jobs, jokes that this Labor Day is the ‘most meaningful’ of his life And it isn’t because Marco Rubio is secretary of state and working for Trump, as he joked at the Cabinet meeting.\n“This is the most meaningful Labor Day of my life as someone with four jobs,” Rubio said. The room erupted in laughter.\nIn addition to his full-time job as America’s chief diplomat, Rubio is also the interim national security adviser, acting administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development and acting archivist of the National Archives and Records Administration.\n Brazil’s president slams ‘insolence and insults’ in an indirect swipe at Trump Brazil’s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva made the remarks during a cabinet meeting in capital Brasilia on Tuesday, after the US leader enforced a 50 per cent tariff hike on Brazilian imported goods that came into effect earlier this month.\n“We don’t accept insolence and insults, or petulance from anyone,” Lula told his ministers, who, like Lula himself, were wearing “Brazil belongs to Brazilians” blue hats. “We are willing to sit at the table on equal terms. What we are not willing to do is be treated as if we were subordinates.” Trump has tied the tariff to the trial of Brazil’s former president Jair Bolsonaro, who is charged with trying to overturn his 2022 election loss.\n Trump, who was indicted in 2023 for his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 US presidential election, appears to identify with Bolsonaro.\n Trump calls for capital punishment for murder in nation’s capital Trump said, “we’re going to be seeking the death penalty” in Washington, D.C., if someone kills someone in the nation’s capital.\nD.C. and nearly two dozen states, about half of the country, have abolished the death penalty.\nTrump said capital punishment is a “very strong preventative.” The Death Penalty Information Center says studies have found no “meaningful evidence” that using the death penalty deters crime.\n Trump cools off on bill name he coined Trump branded his landmark tax law the “One Big, Beautiful Bill” — but now he’s not a big fan of the moniker.\n“I’m not going to use the term ‘great, big, beautiful,” Trump said during a Cabinet meeting Tuesday. “That was good for getting it approved. But it’s not good for explaining to people what it’s all about.” Some corners of the White House are easing off the “big, beautiful” name and instead opting for “Working Families Tax Cuts.” Trump boasts about COVID-19 vaccine effort in front of vax-sceptic Health chief As he was running down the list of accomplishments of his presidencies, Trump boasted about the success of Operation Warp Speed — as his vaccine sceptic HHS leader sat near him.\n Operation Warp Speed was an effort in Trump’s first term that expedited the development and distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine. But Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr has effectively stopped development of the advancement of the mRNA vaccine, which were developed in response to the deadly 2020 pandemic.\n“Operation Warp Speed, people say, is it one of the greatest achievements ever in politics, in the military?” Trump said during a Cabinet meeting Tuesday. “Because it was almost a military procedure.” The president added that “everybody,” including Russian President Vladimir Putin, said “Operation Warp Speed, what you did with that, nobody can believe it.” Trump again misleads on gas prices President Trump again is making false claims about the price of gasoline, saying Tuesday that gas prices are down to about USD 2.25 per gallon. That is nearly a full dollar lower than the actual average prices as calculated by the AAA auto club.\n Gas prices averages about USD 3.18 per gallon as of Tuesday, up 3 cents from a month ago but down from USD 3.35 last year at this time, AAA said.\n At a Cabinet meeting at the White House, Trump again claimed without evidence that gas prices at some stations are as low as USD 2, a fact AAA and other groups dispute.\n“We are not seeing any stations reported to us below USD 2/gal this morning,” said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at gasbuddy.com.\nWholesale prices also are above USD 2 per gallon, and ”no stations sell gas at the wholesale price anyway,” De Haan said on X.\n Trump says Carolina furniture makers should teach their children and grandchildren because of promised tariffs The president says tariffs are coming on furniture imports to help revitalise the domestic industry in North Carolina and South Carolina.\n He said the state has the “most talented woodworkers that you’ve ever seen” but that the business was “stolen from us by others, not only China.” Trump didn’t say when he would impose the tariffs but he encouraged woodworkers in those states to start teaching their children and grandchildren the art of furniture-making.\n“Some of those incredible artists that I knew as young people, they’re older people now,” Trump said at the Cabinet meeting. “But they still have the talent and they have time left, but they’re going to be teaching their sons and their daughters and their grandchildren and it’s going to be a beautiful thing to see. It’s going to happen like magic.” Trump: public jobs bad, private jobs good Trump said the nation has added over half a million private jobs since his inauguration.\n“These are the jobs that make money, create a better life,” he said.\n And while he says private company jobs are up, the number of public federal government jobs are decreasing. Trump bragged that he had laid off 84,000 federal workers.\n Earlier in August, Trump fired the head of the agency that produces the monthly job figures after a report showed that hiring slowed in July and was weaker than previously expected.\n Trump exaggerates about gas prices and domestic manufacturing production while praising his Cabinet members The president opened his Cabinet meeting overstating the case for how US manufacturing has improved during the first months of his second term.\n He claimed gas prices are lower than they actually are at gas pumps. He lambasted one of his frequent environmental targets in windmills, and also talked about how domestic production for things like automobiles may soon improve because of his policies.\n As Trump talked, Cabinet members silently listened. At one point, Trump acknowledged them.\n “I hope this table gets the credit for what’s happening, all of the credit,” he said.

Trim. Smart. Handsome. Happily married.

She should self-reflect on her own jealousy of President Trump’s historic popularity before her show is the next to be pulled off air.\"\n\nTrump, 79, once raged about The View, specifically calling out Hostin and Goldberg.

The gleaming and heavily trafficked tourist district was a deliberate backdrop on the day the Illinois governor directed a defiant message toward the White House: “Mr. President, do not come to Chicago. You are neither wanted here nor needed here.”\n\nThe governor’s protests, however, may not matter. After Trump’s National Guard deployments to Los Angeles in June and Washington, D.C. this month, the Republican says his next targets for federal intervention may be two of the nation’s most Democratic cities: Chicago and Baltimore.\n\nTrump’s possible move — targeting states whose governors are among potential White House contenders in 2028 — would be another escalation of presidential power, directly challenging the rights of states and cities to govern themselves. It also would intensify a partisan scramble for voters’ trust on matters of public safety.\n\nFor Trump, militarizing U.S. streets is the latest tactic to support his “law and order” branding and mass deportation agenda. It’s a way to cast Democratic leaders in affected locales as weak and ineffective, even as Trump exaggerates the violence he’s ostensibly trying to stop. Pritzker “should be calling me, and he should be saying ‘Can you send over the troops please?’” Trump said Tuesday at the White House. “It’s out of control.”\n\nDemocrats see a dangerous overreach by an aspiring authoritarian and have said they will challenge Trump in court if necessary. They also see in the political fight a way to persuade voters, especially moderates and independents, that Republicans bluster on crime while Democrats are better able to protect citizens and keep the peace.\n\n“This is not about fighting crime,” said Pritzker, flanked on Monday by Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and other leaders, adding that it’s more about “an arrogant little man” trying to “intimidate his political rivals.”\n\nYet there are risks for Democrats. Though violent crime is down across the country, including Chicago, arguing over how to combat what’s still happening means tussling on some of Trump’s most comfortable political turf. Additionally, Trump has demonstrated a willingness to block federal money for locales where elected officials have opposed him.\n\nFor Pritzker, another way to fight Trump\n\nPritzker, who is seeking a third term in 2026, has been among Democrats’ most vocal Trump critics. Weeks into Trump’s second administration, Pritzker compared it to the Nazi Third Reich. More recently, he welcomed Texas Democrats who fled the statehouse in Austin to delay Republicans’ partisan redrawing of the state’s congressional districts at Trump’s request.\n\nIn Chicago on Monday, Pritzker and Johnson emphasized that Trump’s administration had not reached out about its plans, first detailed in a weekend Washington Post story. The president acknowledged he hadn’t talked to Illinois or Maryland officials and at one point Monday said he might not send troops unless Pritzker asked.\n\nPritzker’s aides said his priority is to keep a federal deployment from happening. That’s why Pritzker and his staff hustled to gather a cross-section of political, civic and faith leadership in a made-for-TV show of unity that Trump would surely see. Of course, it also trained cameras on Pritzker.\n\n“I know he doesn’t read … but I know he watches television,” he said of Trump. “And so perhaps if somebody from Fox News or from Newsmax is here, they’ll cover the fact that Chicago is in much better shape” because of what local officials are doing.\n\nIn a bit of Trumpian bravado, he added, “If you hurt my people, nothing will stop me, not time or political circumstance, from making sure that you face justice under our constitutional rule of law.”\n\nDemocrats want to reframe the conversation on crime\n\nMaryland Gov. Wes Moore, another potential Democratic contender in 2028, said Trump’s characterizations of Baltimore and other cities reflect a president “living in this blissful ignorance, these tropes.”\n\nNonetheless, voters have been siding with Republicans on the issue.\n\nA CNN/SSRS poll from May found that about four in ten Americans said the GOP’s views on crime and policing aligned more with their own, compared to just three in ten who felt the same about Democrats. The rest said neither party reflected their views.\n\nTrump also had an advantage on the issue over Democrat Kamala Harris in their 2024 general election matchup. According to AP VoteCast, a national survey of presidential voters, about half of respondents said Trump was better able to handle crime, while about 4 in 10 said this about Harris.\n\nDemocrats acknowledged the gap this week at a national party gathering in Minneapolis. In a presentation to Democratic National Committee members, party strategists noted Republicans spent about three times the amount of money on crime-related ads than Democrats did in recent presidential election years.\n\nBut they said there is an opening. They urged Democrats not to mimic Republican “tough-on-crime” rhetoric but instead position themselves as being “serious about safety, not empty scare tactics.”\n\nPritzker aides agreed Democrats have a chance to emphasize public safety policy choices.\n\nA litany of speakers in Chicago cited drops – some of them considerable — in violent crime and property crimes in the city. They also highlighted the hundreds of millions of dollars in Trump administration cuts in federal support for law enforcement, housing and other programs that Johnson called “proven solutions to crime and violence reduction.”\n\n“We cannot incarcerate our way out of violence,” the mayor said.\n\nThere are notable places Trump isn’t mentioning\n\nThe debate also raises questions about where Trump has not called for federal intervention.\n\nTrump, as a candidate, regularly assailed U.S. cities – not just Chicago, Baltimore, Los Angeles and Washington. Detroit was “decimated” and “filthy.” Atlanta was a “killing field.” Pritzker noted that Hattiesburg, Mississippi, and Memphis, Tennessee, have notably higher murder rates than Chicago.\n\nBut Mississippi, Tennessee and Georgia all have Republican governors. Michigan, meanwhile, is home to Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, but one who has deviated from her colleagues like Pritzker and California Gov. Gavin Newsom by engaging more directly with Trump, including in-person visits to the White House.\n\nAnd even one leading Republican executive, Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt, added tacit support to Democrats’ critiques.\n\n“Ultimately, the best public safety outcomes are delivered by local police departments and local officials, who know the communities,” he said in a statement, without mentioning Trump by name. “America’s mayors never see takeovers by other levels of government as a tactic that has any track record of producing results. Local control is always best.”\n\nBarrow reported from Atlanta.

After Swift endorsed Kamala Harris in August last year, he simply posted \"I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!\" And this May he posted a follow-up to his attack. \"Has anyone noticed that, since I said ‘I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT,’ she’s no longer ‘HOT?'”, he wrote. In a 2023 interview with Variety magazine, Trump said Swift was \"unusually beautiful\" and added \"I hear she's very talented.\" But he added: \"She's legitimately liberal? It's not an act? It surprises me that a country star can be successful being liberal.\" The Love Story singer, 35, made the announcement in a joint Instagram post with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Kelce, which showed pictures of him proposing to her and the pair embracing in a garden. The post read: \"Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married.\" Swift, who has 280 million Instagram followers, also posted a heart on her Instagram story with her song So High School from the anthology version of album The Tortured Poets Department, which is said to have been written about her fiance, playing in the background.","summary":"The US President has not always been entirely complimentary about Taylor Swift - and he was asked about her wedding announcement during a cabinet meeting.","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/donald-trump-shares-feelings-taylor-35797676","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article35797677.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/0_US-POLITICS-TRUMP-CABINET.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-26 18:52:54","author":"Mikey Smith","authors":["Mikey Smith"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.014},{"id":354580446,"title":"Donald Trump Reacts to Taylor Swift, Travis Kelce Engagement","text":"President Donald Trump responded to a question during Tuesday's Cabinet meeting about pop star Taylor Swift and Kansas City Chiefs' Travis Kelce's engagement announcement.A reporter said, \"I have to tell you, the biggest pop culture news of the year broke while we were in this Cabinet meeting.

In recent years, she has endorsed Democratic candidates, backing Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in 2020 and Harris and Tim Walz in 2024. Swift has also urged her fans to register to vote and participate in elections, a stance that has often put her in direct opposition to Trump's policies and rhetoric.Trump, who once praised Swift as \"fantastic\" and \"terrific,\" has turned sharply critical since she entered the political fray.

He suffered unimaginal [sic] —unimaginable hardships — physical harm, while there [in an El Salvadoran prison].”\n\nSo America’s infamous “Maryland Man” is what now—a whiny little girl?\n\nThis guy is an accused MS-13 gang member. His wife filed protection orders against him. He’s facing federal charges for human trafficking. Other accusations include participating in a murder and soliciting child pornography.\n\nOh, and he’s been in the United States illegally for 14 years.\n\nOh, but now the poor widdle baby will require therapy for the trauma he experienced while being accountable for his actions. Life must be so difficult for someone to deal with accountability for their actions when the entire Democrat Party and Fake News Complex treats them like Martin Luther King Jr. reborn.\n\nIf Kamala Harris were president, taxpayers would pick up his therapy bill, which you can bet would take place at an elite resort.\n\nGranted, I don’t have a lot of experience with the justice system, but if I were facing serious prison time, I would not want my attorney spreading the news that I’m a neurotic little bitch who needs professional help licking my emotional wounds.\n\nWe can laugh at this, and we should laugh at this, but the best part is this…\n\nDemocrats and their regime media allies were sure they could turn this illegal alien into a martyr. Any other Republican president would have run away from this fight, would’ve found a way to surrender. Not President Trump.\n\nWhat he has done with Garcia is brilliant. By simply enforcing the law, he has turned the left’s precious martyr into an example.\n\nWhat do you think the Garcia story says to the millions of illegal aliens who will not earn this same sacred cow treatment from the organized left? It says, We are so serious about deporting you, we will not even make an exception for the sacred cow. \n\nTrump has taken a play out of the playbook Democrats and the media have successfully used against the GOP for decades, and turned it to his advantage. His refusal to do anything but deport the Patron Saint of Immigration sends a message to all illegals that no one is safe.\n\nThe key to fixing America’s illegal alien crisis is self-deportation, and the Trump administration is brilliantly using the Garcia saga to motivate self-deportations.\n\nAnd now, thanks to CNN and this attorney, the message to all illegals is this: Trump’s enforcing of the law has turned a credibly accused wife beater/gangbanger/human trafficker into a broken man.\n\nSo, yeah, you might want to skedaddle back home.\n\nJohn Nolte’s first and last novel, Borrowed Time, is winning five-star raves from everyday readers.

'I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos.'\n\nShe signed her post 'childless cat lady,' a shot at Vice President JD Vance, who once insulted single women with cats in a speech. \n\nIn response, Trump famously announced in all-caps on Truth Social that, 'I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!'\n\nEarlier this month, Trump decried Swift as 'woke' and claimed she was shedding fans after her controversial endorsement.\n\n'Ever since I alerted the world as to what she was by saying on TRUTH that I can't stand her (HATE!). She was booed out of the Super Bowl and became, NO LONGER HOT,' Trump claimed.\n\n'The tide has seriously turned - Being WOKE is for losers, being Republican is what you want to be,' the president

playing in front of President Trump at the 2025 Super Bowl was a 'great honor.' \n\nSwift and Kelce went public with their relationship in September 2023 as the singer started attending his NFL games, and the football player even dressing in a suit to perform on stage on her billion dollar global Eras tour.\n\nFans of the seemingly happy couple expressed worries that Kelce could end up as the latest discarded lover that would fuel future ballads in Swift's musical catalog.\n\nBut the couple seemed inseparable, despite speculation from fans that the relationship would not last. \n\nSwift appeared on Kelce's podcast on August 13 to announce her new album 'The Life of a Showgirl' and revealed details of their romance.\n\nShe said she became 'obsessed' with football after they started

Today, however, Georgia GOP Chairman Josh McKoon is feeling optimistic that his party can build upon the headway it’s made with the state’s electorate. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: RNC Chief Passes The Torch As He Kicks Off Senate Run)\n\n“In 2018, Gov. Brian Kemp was elected by a roughly 40,000 vote majority, I think something like that,” McKoon told the DCNF at the 2025 Republican National Committee (RNC) summer meeting. “In 2022, he was elected by a very strong majority, about 54% in the general election against Stacey Abrams — so a huge improvement there.”\n\n“From 2020, we had an 11,000 certified margin-of-victory for Joe Biden,” said McKoon, noting that Trump flipped this small deficit to a whopping 115,000 margin-of-victory four years later. “So 2022, 2024, things have been trending in our direction.”\n\n‘We’re A Competitive State’\n\nBiden raked in 2,473,633 votes in Georgia during the 2020 presidential election, eking out a 11,779 votes over Trump and becoming the first Democratic presidential candidate to carry the state since Bill Clinton in 1992. In runoff elections held in January 2021, both GOP Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler were unseated by Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, all but confirming long-held warnings that red Georgia was turning purple.\n\nIn 2018, Kemp was elected governor with a slim margin, besting former Georgia House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams by less than two percentage points in an election where nearly 4 million votes were cast.\n\nIn the years since those elections, voting patterns suggest that Georgia residents are flocking back to the GOP.\n\nIn the 2022 rematch between Kemp and Abrams, the governor stomped his perennial rival with a 7.5 point margin, and last November, Trump handily flipped the Peach State back to the GOP with over 115,000 votes more than then Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nWhile these numbers are reason for Republicans to be bullish, McKoon said it’s no excuse for his party to be complacent — especially with eyes already on 2026 races and Republicans eager to take back a seat currently occupied by Ossoff.\n\n“We’ve got to continue to do the work,” the Georgia GOP chairman said to the DCNF. “We’re a competitive state, but Georgia remains a center-right state.”\n\nThe Cook Political Report rates the Georgia Senate race as a toss-up. While the GOP lost a top contender after Kemp — a very popular sitting governor — opted not to enter, other Republicans such as Rep. Mike Collins, Rep. Buddy Carter and former University of Tennessee football coach Derek Dooley have officially thrown their hat in the ring.\n\n“We’ve got a great opportunity to fire John Ossoff next November and replace him with an America First conservative,” McKoon continued. “I think whoever we wind up nominating, John Ossoff can’t run away from his record.”\n\nThe upcoming Senate election in Georgia will play a role in the ultimate balance of power in the U.S. Senate, where the GOP currently holds a 53-seat majority. Republicans will be defending 22 seats while Democrats will only be defending 13, but the vast majority of GOP seats in play are in states Trump easily won, giving Democrats little room for error if they want to reclaim the upper chamber.\n\n“Senator Ossoff is well-prepared to defeat any challenger. Our campaign will continue to build insurmountable momentum to win next November,” Ossoff Campaign Manager Ellen Foster stated to the DCNF.\n\nIn recent years, Georgia has emerged as an epicenter for political flashpoints that have gripped the nation.\n\nNursing student Laken Riley was murdered by an illegal migrant in February 2024 while on a trail run near the University of Georgia campus, igniting debate over the border crisis and illegal migrant crime. The murder prompted stricter laws in the state and also spawned the Laken Riley Act in Congress, which was signed by President Donald Trump in January.\n\nFulton County District Attorney Fani Willis rocketed to national attention after attempting to prosecute Trump over his alleged conduct in the 2020 presidential election, but she was eventually disqualified from prosecuting the case over alleged impropriety by a Georgia appeals court. Investigators discovered that Willis was paying Nathan Wade, a lead prosecutor in the case at the time, while having an ongoing romantic relationship and taking extravagant vacations together.\n\n‘The Midterms Are Ahead’\n\nGeorgia’s growing prominence on the Electoral College map was made all the more apparent as the National Republican Committee (RNC) chose to host its annual summer meeting in Atlanta earlier in August. On Friday, state GOP chairmen from across the U.S. chose Florida State Sen. Joe Gruters, a longtime Trump ally, as the next leader of the RNC.\n\n“The midterms are ahead, where we must expand our majority in the House to Senate and continue electing Republicans nationwide, and then we march more towards the presidential election, where the stakes cannot be higher,” Gruters said in an acceptance speech before RNC members. “The Democrats want open borders, socialist policies and weak leadership — we want strong families, secure communities and American greatness.”\n\n“But here’s the deal at the end of the day, whatever party does a better job of uniting the factions and bringing everybody together, we all win at the end,” Gruters said.\n\nGruters is taking over the reins from former RNC Chairman Michael Whatley, who officially stepped down from his position to run for an open Senate seat in North Carolina, another state where the outcome could prove tantamount to the GOP’s control of Congress.\n\nThe RNC’s finances changed drastically under Whatley’s tenure.\n\nThe North Carolinian, who was tapped by Trump to lead the GOP early in 2024 after Ronna McDaniel stepped down, inherited a party with little cash on hand and an election integrity program in need of an upgrade. Whatley left the party with an expansive election integrity effort and with more than $80 million cash on hand — more than five times more than the Democrats.\n\nAlso under Whatley’s leadership, the RNC filed over 100 lawsuits across 20 states in the 2024 election cycle, according to the party website. The GOP recruited 230,000 volunteers and 6,500 lawyers who were on the ground on Election Day to help address election issues, Whatley previously told the Daily Caller.\n\nGruters on Friday indicated that he plans to expand on the success achieved by his predecessor. The newly-minted chairman previously served as RNC treasurer, playing a major part in the GOP’s current cash advantage over Democrats.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee (DNC) only has $15 million on hand and Harris’ 2024 loss is still weighing heavily on the party, with the DNC paying over $15 million toward her presidential campaign expenses during the first half of 2025. In the DNC’s own summer meeting, one of the first items on the agenda Monday was a “land acknowledgment” of the Dakota people who allegedly owned the surrounding Minnesota land before European colonization.\n\nThe fundraising edge could prove game changing for Republicans running in competitive states like North Carolina and Georgia.\n\nMcKoon says next November is the perfect opportunity to “fire” Ossoff, arguing the Georgia Democrat had the advantage of having no record when first elected to office.\n\n“He has firmly established himself as one of the most far left members of the United States Senate, wholly disqualified to be serving in the first place, and we’re going to be able to expose them,” the Georgia GOP chairman said to the DCNF. “What we’re going to be doing this year and next year is reminding Georgians relentlessly that this guy is not a common sense guy.”\n\nOssoff has, for months, been viewed as one of the most vulnerable Senate Democrats up for election in 2026. During an August visit to Georgia, Vice President J.D. Vance torched the Democrat as a “far-left liberal” and hammered him for his recent opposition to the One Big Beautiful Bill. Republicans plan to make Ossoff’s vote against the bill’s tax relief components — projected by the White House to give Georgians thousands of dollars in higher take home pay — a top campaign issue during the 2026 midterms.\n\n“He’s a far left California liberal who has no business representing people in Georgia,” McKoon said.\n\nEditor’s note: This article has been updated to include comment from the Ossoff campaign.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

This is a man whose knee-jerk reaction to Donald Trump’s victory in 2024 was to jump in a podcast studio with the unhinged right-wing ideologue Charlie Kirk and characterize the participation of trans athletes in women’s sports as “deeply unfair.” That pivot, like so many others in the Newsom doctrine, seemed to be the result of a man guesstimating the current orientation of the vibe shift and quickly closing ranks around his newly triangulated opinion. (It is also precisely why the governor is in the midst of a reactionary flip-flop on homelessness policy.) Add to that his other cartoonishly two-faced foibles—like the time he ate dinner at the French Laundry during the height of COVID—and you can understand why nobody ever seems to trust him.\n\nFor a long while, Newsom’s shiftiness seemed to elude his self-perception. The world saw a knavish operator, but when he looked in the mirror, the governor saw the heir apparent to Obama. And in that sense, the best thing the governor ever did for his political career was to finally give up the ghost. At last, Newsom recognizes who he has always been, and I think that’s why his Trump impression has struck a chord.\n\nIf you somehow don’t know what I’m talking about, for the past few weeks, Newsom and his press office have delivered the bulk of his social media messaging in a distinctly Trumpian diction. The tweets are written in all caps and are smattered with random old-guy quotation marks, parentheticals, and pejorative nicknames. (Karoline Leavitt is KAROLYIN’ LEAVITT, Ted Cruz is CANCUN CRUZ, and Newsom himself is AMERICA’S FAVORITE GOVERNOR.) The governor launched this gimmick in conjunction with his plan to redraw California’s congressional maps ahead of the midterms, a fitting move given the antidemocratic creep Trump’s brinkmanship has brought about. Naturally, Newsom has also matched Trump’s penchant for self-aggrandizement, reposting garish A.I.–generated collages that trumpet his greatness. One recent highlight featured the governor, draped in the American flag, standing proud over the Golden Gate Bridge, as Thomas Kinkade–esque fireworks sparkle in the distance. It looks like something you’d find in a bizarro version of the Cracker Barrel gift shop. Newsom captioned it “WOW, AN HONOR !!” (The spaces between the words and ensuing punctuation are an especially nice touch.)\n\nThere’s lots more where that came from. The governor has begun to sell merchandise, including a red hat emblazoned with the words Newsom Was Right About Everything! and a coffee mug that reads Newsom 2026. (The year is a nod to California’s redistricting efforts, which will be on the ballot this fall, as well as to the man’s not-so-secret presidential ambitions. The description for the mug: “Because apparently term limits are just suggestions now.”) Unshackled by the solemnity that the Democrats foisted upon themselves once they became the country’s “resistance” back in 2016, Newsom now has the leverage to playfully stretch the truth in a distinctly MAGA-ish way. (“I NOW HAVE THE HIGHEST POLL NUMBERS I’VE EVER HAD, SOME IN THE 60’S AND EVEN 70’S,” he posted over the weekend.) The whole spectacle got especially surreal when Newsom uploaded an A.I. illustration of Kid Rock—in full Uncle Sam regalia—giving his endorsement to the governor (“Kid Rock Wants You to Support Gavin Newsom”). The musician did no such thing and was apparently annoyed enough by the post to correct the record on his own X account. It has been clear for quite some time that the old rules of engagement are irrelevant. Newsom, to his credit, is playing the game.\n\nI am loath to admit that this gambit is working on me. I’ve never particularly liked Newsom, but it has been liberating to indulge, for the first time in my life, in the elements that have made Trumpism so appetizing for a vast cross section of Americans. You know what I’m talking about. The mean-spiritedness, the compulsive name-calling, the prioritization of emotional truth over objective truth, and, perhaps most importantly, the break from the shrill ultimatums about the death of the republic. That’s not to say that those warnings aren’t valid—rather, it’s just that, eight years in, at a time when everything else feels bad, and after all those warnings have gone soundly unheeded, it is nice to have someone telling the president to eat shit in the only language he could ever understand. The Trump approach is to flood the zone with a cavalcade of irrelevant bullshit that briefly blots over our mental faculties before dissipating. (Remember when we were all focused on Greenland?) If hardcore MAGA partisans are, for the first time in their political activation, being forced to spend mental energy on something equally as stupid and futile, then I’m willing to call that a win.\n\nNow, I don’t think any of this is a good omen for our political culture. The Democrats have tried so many different approaches to disgrace Trump, all of which have been centered on the idea that such an unserious figure was never presidential material. But after the man repelled those attacks and entrenched himself in the White House, aping his buffoonishness certainly looks like a kind of defeat. Just four years ago, Joe Biden won the office on a campaign that promised a return to normality. These days, everyone has conceded that the game is broken. It’s a race to the bottom, and—as he always does—Newsom is angling for a head start.\n\nHe has good reason to keep it up. The parody has assisted in the governor’s surging support ahead of the still-way-off 2028 presidential cycle. One poll has him second in the field of likely candidates, behind only Kamala Harris. But data this early is rarely predictive, and I seriously doubt that Newsom will maintain this momentum when we get closer to the primary. The transactional nature of his political philosophy will eventually outweigh his flair for the moment, and I can’t imagine ever voting for someone who seems seconds away from selling me out. (The coke dealer–esque slick-back and high cheekbones don’t help, though one of those problems could be solved.)\n\nSo that might mean that I’m underestimating Newsom’s electoral future. One constant refrain I hear from California Democrats is that they believe their governor to be legitimately sociopathic, a creature of the night who desires nothing but power. And yet they can’t wait to vote for him in the general election because, as one voter put it, “he may be a psycho, but he’s our psycho.” I think that about sums it up. When the governor’s Trump impression broke through, I noticed a few Trump-aligned media figures circulating some dirty laundry in an attempt to discredit him. It was a photograph of a young Newsom at some glitzy gala with the top two buttons of his white shirt unfastened. He’s staring at a woman’s breasts with a big, sloppy grin plastered across his face. An image like that might have hit its target a few years ago, but we’re well through the looking glass now. The incumbent is a twice-divorced casino boss who harbored a personal relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. Our secretary of defense has a history of ordering three gin and tonics at breakfast. Gavin Newsom might honestly be the man for the moment—and what a sorry moment it is.","summary":"Is the only way to beat Trump to copy his stupidity?

Democratic politicians are responding the only way they know how: by heeding the advice of the wonks who helped get them into this situation in the first place — and whose advice is to avoid discussing what Trump is doing.\n\nBlue Rose Research, the firm led by Democratic establishment darling David Shor, produced a memo earlier this month digging into the effectiveness of various messages related to Trump’s takeover of Washington, D.C. The firm advised that messaging around Trump’s “rising authoritarianism” was “highly unconvincing,” while messages that say Trump wants to “distract” from his damaging tariffs or horrifying Medicaid cuts were more effective. Meanwhile, Republican messaging about how Trump is clamping down on gang violence tested through the roof.\n\nThe Aug. 15 memo, a copy of which was reviewed by Rolling Stone, could explain, at least partially, why Democrats haven’t exactly been going to the mat over Trump sending the military into the nation’s capital, and threatening to do the same in other liberal strongholds. \n\nHouse Minority Leaker Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) was asked on CNN on Sunday what the party’s plan is to fight the president sending troops into Chicago. He only offered that Trump has no authority to do this, and that he supports the men and women working in law enforcement. He also, as the Blue Rose memo suggested is effective, cast the federal takeover as a “distraction” from Trump’s unpopular policies. Jeffries didn’t seem too worked up about any of this, delivering his talking points with a complacency that certainly did not bely that the United States is currently experiencing a militarized dismantling of representative democracy.\n\nRepublicans appear convinced — despite the polling data and public backlash to the contrary — that Trump’s military deployments and hostile takeovers on American soil can be a win-win situation for them politically. Various operatives and administration officials tell Rolling Stone that the “tough on crime” politics typically redound to their favor, so they welcome Democrats picking that fight. However, two Trump advisers note, if Democratic figures try to avoid the subject, or tread too gingerly, they risk looking weak to the public in the face of Trump’s displays of armed military force.\n\nEditor’s picks\n\nThe 250 Greatest Albums of the 21st Century So Far\n\nThe 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time\n\nThe 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\n\n100 Best Movies of the 21st Century\n\n“Any Democrat who has to take a poll to find out that voters want to be safe from violent criminals has a more fundamental problem,” says John McLaughlin, one of Trump’s top pollsters.\n\nWhile Blue Rose Research isn’t a household name, the firm has enormous sway in the Democratic Party and with the liberal pundit class. Vox has described Blue Rose’s leader, Shor, as perhaps “the most influential data scientist in the Democratic Party.” After the election, The New York Times’ liberal columnist and podcaster Ezra Klein invited Shor to explain why Trump won, characterizing him as “a very skilled interpreter of data” who “has gotten a lot of things right before other people did.” \n\nKlein helpfully noted that Shor “works with campaigns and progressive groups so he has a perspective from the inside,” without explaining the full significance of Shor and Blue Rose’s work to try to elect Kamala Harris, which failed spectacularly. \n\nAs the Times explained elsewhere, Blue Rose handled much of the ad testing for the Super PAC Future Forward as it worked to support Harris’ campaign. Blue Rose’s team was effectively embedded within Future Forward, which served as Harris’ primary outside spender and spent $560 million to boost the Democratic ticket in 2024. It’s worth noting that many of the ads run by Future Forward were completely unwatchable — overstuffed with tidbits about various policies, provided too quickly for a casual viewer to process and often presented by random narrators. \n\nRelated Content\n\nTim Walz Doesn’t Mince Words on Trump: ‘These Are Fascist Policies’\n\nTrump: ‘A Lot of People Are Saying Maybe We’d Like a Dictator’\n\nTrump Admin Arrests Kilmar Abrego Garcia Again, Ready to Deport Him to Uganda\n\nRussia’s Foreign Minister Struggles to Defend Civilian Deaths in Ukraine\n\nBlue Rose has worked with much of the Democratic Party apparatus — the Democratic National Committee; the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and its outside spending arm, Senate Majority PAC; the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and its independent arm, House Majority PAC.\n\nThe firm is prone to bold proclamations. Among its contributions to the 2024 campaign was the idea that running negative ads against Trump was ineffective, and contrast was more important, according to people familiar with the Blue Rose operation. (Democratic National Committee officials are still incensed that Future Forward eschewed attacks on Trump.) Another was that the Super PAC should deploy its ads late in the campaign, when the cake was already nearly baked.\n\nThese proclamations are typically based on experiments, randomized-controlled trials, that are supposed to determine the efficacy of ads and messages. Critics question whether this is a viable way to test the impact of political messages, as well as the methodology — which Blue Rose doesn’t share — based, in part, on who exactly is participating in its web panels. \n\nJake Grumbach, an associate professor at the University of California, Berkeley, made an apparent dig at the methodology on Sunday, joking on X that the Democratic Party is being run by “people who sign up to take online surveys about the persuasiveness of various digital campaign messaging vignettes via consumer reward programs.”\n\nOne progressive research expert says the people participating in Blue Rose’s randomized-controlled trials are “terminally online people who take a lot of surveys for some kind of compensation.” (Another source put it more bluntly, describing the participants as “weirdos.”)\n\nBlue Rose did not respond to a request for comment from Rolling Stone.\n\nA common criticism of the Blue Rose model is that virtually no one consumes political ads or messages the way these participants are viewing them. Most people watching TV or scrolling through their social media tune out such messages or skip right past them; an ad needs to grab their attention in a way that won’t be replicated in the tests.\n\n“A message nobody hears cannot persuade them,” says the progressive research expert. “They’re testing with a captive audience when their task is to actually get heard — meaning get people to stop scrolling in the first place. What they’ve tested is so bland no one is going to notice.”\n\nThere’s also the issue of what the firm is measuring. The questions about Trump’s takeover, for instance, were designed to measure how certain messages affect whether people do or don’t approve of Trump. \n\nA Democratic Party operative says that’s “not how people’s brains work, it’s not how the media environment works.” The progressive research expert says that “Trump disapproval is a meaningless metric,” adding, rhetorically, “What do you get if more people disapprove of Trump?” \n\nTalking about Blue Rose’s advice to Democrats to sidestep the topic of Trump’s military takeover, the Democratic Party operative notes: “Trump taking over D.C. by police force is salient right now. If you open up Instagram, it’s all you’re looking at — it’s out there, and people are seeing it. You can’t choose what’s salient.”\n\nThe operative notes that Blue Rose is, of course, selecting what messages to test. The messages are often written by its team — and those messages aren’t necessarily good. \n\nIndeed, by its own metrics, the firm’s messages calling Trump’s military takeover a distraction from tariffs and Medicaid cuts only tested in the 52nd and 51st percentiles among the messages it’s tested so far this year — or “barely above average,” as the firm noted. Why not try writing more messages?\n\n“If you try a message and it doesn’t work, the conclusion shouldn’t be that there’s no way to talk about this,” the operative says, adding that Blue Rose puts out its advice “with a lot of authority, and people listen to it.”\n\nBeyond the basic premise, the methodology, and the messages the firm is choosing to test, there is something fundamentally unsettling about Blue Rose’s approach — and that of the Democratic Party — to Trump 2.0 overall.\n\nIn the military takeover messaging memo, the firm advised Democrats that people basically don’t want to hear about it — as Trump prepared to expand the military crackdown to other blue cities. Messages about Trump being a “wannabe dictator” tested poorly, yet Trump said in the Oval Office on Monday, “A lot of people are saying maybe we’d like a dictator.” Messages about Trump putting “democracy at risk” tested badly, but just three days after the memo was released, Trump was promising to sign an unconstitutional executive order asserting that states follow his own rules for elections.\n\nTrump is attempting a fascist power grab, out in the open, for all the world to see — and Democratic leaders and their wonks don’t feel like it’s worth their time to even warn the public about what Trump is doing, or what he’s likely to do next, let alone try to stop him. But what else, exactly, should America’s opposition party be doing right now?\n\nAs the progressive research expert puts it, “It’s absolutely mind boggling to be discussing message testing in response to abductions, concentration camp construction, and unleashing [the] military on Americans.”\n\nOne Democrat who hasn’t been afraid to call out Trump’s regime is Tim Walz, the Minnesota governor and Harris’ vice presidential candidate. \n\n“I am willing to say each and every one of us are unified around the idea that this cruelty must end, this slow-rolling attempt at undermining democracy,” Walz said on Monday during a Democratic National Committee meeting. “I always get in trouble for it and I’ll continue to say it and I don’t think we do ourselves any favors when we don’t name it: These are fascist policies.”\n\nTrending Stories\n\n‘American Idol’ Music Supervisor and Husband’s Cause of Death Revealed\n\nTrump: ‘A Lot of People Are Saying Maybe We’d Like a Dictator’\n\nWill Smith Accused of Creating an AI Crowd for Tour Video\n\nDevon Walker Exits ‘SNL’ After 3 Seasons: ‘Sometimes It Was Toxic as Hell’\n\nIllinois Gov.

There’s no emergency here that calls for military intervention.\n\nPritzker and Walz might have just failed the Blue Rose message test.
